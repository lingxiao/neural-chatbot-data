A: that's true tha that's true an and really it comes down to a moral question i mean for professional athletics a lot of people regard them as paid mercenaries anyway and if they choose to abuse their bodies in order to enhance their performance so be it um </s>
B: right that's true too </s>
A: you know but um the morality of it you know the kind of example that um those people who are highly visible set for others you know is a serious question </s>

A: so they're available by uh prescription or you should uh you know regulate your use under a phy under a physician's care but they're not illegal </s>
B: and normally there's a coa would the coach know that like say a athlete was uh using steroids would the coach necessarily know or no it could be something they're doing real sneaky </s>
A: th the coach would generally be the person dispensing them laugh breath yeah </s>
B: ah okay i was g that's what i was thinking but the coached think about it because it bec it could become an insurance issue </s>
A: breath </s>
