A: uh you have think i have this topic before uh lipsmack let us see breath i pretty much just said uh that they should not um really limit where they should go i mean they should pretty much go where they want to go </s>
B: true </s>
A: it just it just uh the cost factor i guess </s>
B: yeah that would uh breath might factor into it a little bit uh </s>
A: yeah i do not i do not really know how much or what exactly the parents should what reasons they would uh limit uh where they go exactly besides the cost i do not really see what would really be logical at all </s>
B: right cost uh i could see cost being a factor holding them back and maybe even location if they would want to go visit if it is too far away or something of that nature but uh breath yeah if they want to go whatever they need to go for whatever they want to do breath eh they should be able to do that </s>
A: so you think they should uh have a say in where they go </s>
B: i do not think they should have a say i think they should encourage the person to decide you know what would be best for them breath and honestly if uh depends on the situation parents paying for the whole thing you know they should have maybe a little bit of say in the factor but not you know the overall riding decision breath the other the person got to attend the and got to be liking the school </s>
A: mhm </s>
B: so they need to do that breath </s>
A: um breath </s>
B: do's and do not's well i do not think they should pressure them into like okay daddy went to this school you should go to this school too </s>
A: yeah yeah i never thought of that yeah that </s>
B: i think they should </s>
A: that is definitely something that they should not um pressure a kid into doing if the kid does not want to go i guess </s>
B: yeah right yeah hey may </s>
A: i can see i can see how yeah some parents would would encourage that </s>
B: yeah i would want my son to go to school but if he does not want to you know there is jobs out there where you do not really need the education albeit but uh breath you do not really need an education in some places depends on what his interests or her interests are </s>
A: yeah hm yeah it was not it to do i think yeah the also um they should also help like instead of just letting the kid go out off on his own kind of offer a little guidance i guess </s>
B: yeah </s>
A: maybe take a couple of trips to </s>
B: yeah to to different places </s>
A: check out yeah </s>
B: looking looking around different ones do not uh except the first one </s>

A: mhm </s>
B: i find it to be uh cost effective to go to the local community college </s>
A: mhm </s>
B: for the first couple years until they decide uh breath where they want to go because you can still get your basic general education in those couple of years </s>
A: yeah </s>
B: and not have to pay a fortune for it laugh it is still pretty cost effective plus they are close closer to home </s>
A: mhm </s>
B: but all also depends on the kid i would breath i think i would encourage my kid to do that uh for a cost factor and also for the fact that you can get the same type of education right off the bat but depends they got a a scholarship how can you refuse that breath so the circumstances do change i think </s>
A: yeah </s>
B: how many calls did you make </s>
