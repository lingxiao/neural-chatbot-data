A: if i think about it even more it could go b it could go both ways i mean a low profile case depending on the per individual i mean what is what is the crime i mean who can decide i mean who can decide what is is private or what is not i mean i i think as uh in a free society we should be able to see certain things i think ev everything should not be hidden hidden from us </s>
B: yeah but any court case is public is a public info anyway </s>
A: lipsmack okay and it is public on record right that means you have you have to go back and research it </s>
B: yeah mhm </s>
A: but i mean to see it live and at the at the time that it is happening would not that be more interesting </s>
B: breath uh i think to me i am actually indifferent for for people's problems actually maybe that is just my own personal position i could not care less if it is televised or not yeah it makes no difference to me </s>
A: okay okay </s>
B: breath but eh one thing i do think is when it is televised it then has a tendency to prejudice or bias the judge the jury and everyone involved </s>
A: breath </s>
B: because the media can now give you a representation that makes you think oh guilty as hell or vice versa breath you know some cases get moved simply because of that media attention </s>
A: okay yeah they give get them off of a different venue yeah i understand they get them off a different venue which in in many cases is true because a person can get a trail a fair trial </s>
B: yeah </s>
A: um i guess i guess the main one they can speak of would be the oj case </s>
B: mhm </s>
A: in are you uh uh if you are familiar with that or know anything about that that was that was that was very high highly publicized i personally </s>
B: very mhm </s>
A: would not have um wanted to show that but i also believe that i personally believe that he was not uh that he was innocent </s>
B: you believe he was innocent </s>
A: yeah </s>
B: okay but now you from what the the way it was exposed they said the opposite the media was saying something else </s>
A: yeah y y yeah i i but i was looking at i was trying to make a i was trying to keep it was not just oj or anybody as far as the case would go i guess they i guess they really wanted to know because it was a high profile person </s>
B: mhm mhm breath because and here is another thing for the mere fact that it is high profile a lot of people immediately think oh he is rich he has got to be guilty </s>
A: breath yeah okay that is true i mean that is really uh conventionally uh hard thing to people just sort of pre-judge they do not know and you have to really look at the whole facts and then you have to say well okay look at the whole facts and what has been presented and what has not been presented </s>
B: mhm </s>
A: um the reason i say that i do not think he was guilty is because i do not think one person can kill two people real quick and get away </s>
B: laugh that is true but then he ha the way i believe it he had something to do with it he knows about it or somewhere along the line he was involved </s>
A: lipsmack oh yeah m maybe not with the physical aspect </s>
B: mhm </s>
A: but maybe it was something that was under the table or you know correlating or anything but i mean something that was uh you know that was under you know under the table that was that was happening i think that was happening uh i think a lot of a lot of the profile high profile case then how do you how </s>
B: mhm </s>
A: do you satisfy the public curiosity i mean how do how do you how do you make it fair where everyone can see i mean what do you do </s>
B: how do you do what </s>
A: breath i mean they say if they do not profile a case they do not show it how do you establish the guilt or non-guilt even if it was not a high profile case or for a high profile individual just an an average person an average everyday person that is working </s>
B: i mean regardless they will establish guilt or innocence whatever the case high or low profile </s>
A: okay but it should the the the re the guilt should be proven beyond a reasonable doubt </s>
B: true </s>
A: so uh it is um uh it it is always very very controversial </s>
B: yeah </s>
A: eh you you you know and i i would not watch wish anyone to go to prison or to be accused of anything that they did not do i think everyone deserves a fair trial you know </s>
B: mhm right but the media events with oj surrounding the oj case was more like he bought his way out of trouble </s>
A: yeah yeah that is true because he had a high profile lawyer and he had a lot of money and stuff which in fact you know however it went you know and uh ah it is really a shame laugh it is uh uh i think knowing i think the the ones who really got hurt a lot were the children </s>
B: mhm yeah </s>
A: because they had they had to go that they had to go through that and i think it was so good i do not think i would want to put my children through that i think that was so wrong and that was the main thing </s>
B: mhm </s>
A: and then and then regardless you know you have a parent who has lost a child you know their their mother is gone and uh now no one knows </s>
