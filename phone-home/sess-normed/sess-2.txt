B: oh it is okay so do you think they should be punished um regardless if someone dies they should be punished just if they were drinking while um driving period </s>
A: absolutely </s>
B: yeah i think um i think that is a good idea i think if people realized that these laws are unbendable they can not get away with it then perhaps it will cut down on it breath so </s>
A: i i agree i mean i i mean i go out i work in center city and i go out here all the time and i always see people they will have a couple drinks at a bar oh i am fine to drive i am fine to drive well how fine are you when that person runs in front of the street you know runs in front of your car how quick are your reflexes </s>

B: oh </s>
A: but i also think it might be a little too involved to have you know cops at every bar watching people leave </s>
B: right </s>
A: then seeing if they are going to get into a car um you know i think that is a huge th it it is a deterrent but it is also maybe uh too much to do </s>
B: yeah the i have never heard of that but it is certainly a good idea i guess in theory but in actuality i guess they do not have enough police officers to stay and watch </s>
