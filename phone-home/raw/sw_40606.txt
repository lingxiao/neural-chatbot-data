36.91 40.27 B: i believe so, too.

39.21 43.28 A: so, you know, it is, %uh, whether the school does it or not it should begin at home

43.32 47.94 A: you know, so whether the school do or not it does not make a difference to me because my

42.76 45.14 B: absolutely.

47.97 51.40 A: kids {breath} are educated and they been educated since

51.41 56.77 A: small, {breath} you know, because i always talk to them, {breath} you know, to talk to them, to, you know, let

56.76 61.77 A: them know if anybody touch them in a way {breath} that they should not be touched, you know, that they should tell me. 

61.78 64.44 A: you know, so i have started that since my kids was little.  

64.16 70.97 B: and i think that is so important. i agree a hundred percent. {breath} i think that it is the parents responsibility 

70.98 75.61 B: to %um teach their children about sex, {breath} %um.

76.10 80.96 B: i do not i really do not feel that it is {breath} a school requirement. 

80.97 86.23 B: i think that it should come from the parents, {breath} though i do know

80.73 82.20 A: no, me either.

84.48 89.52 A: but for the, yeah, but for the kids who parents do not do what they supposed to do,

87.85 93.91 B: {breath} well, see, that is it and i do know that there are some parents that are uncomfortable talking to their

93.92 96.80 B: children, which is a shame but i know that {breath} 

94.92 104.42 A: or some of them that are too busy or too into other things. yeah, just some parents are on drugs, you know. right.

97.02 105.53 B: or who just do not care. you know, unfortunately there is a lot of there is a lot out there like that. {breath} %um, you know, i am 

105.59 109.69 B: i am very fortunate in that i have a very open relationship with my daughter.

108.77 110.94 A: i do, too. {laugh} 

109.93 119.72 B: {lipsmack} and i i feel very lucky about that. she comes to me. she tells me things that {breath} it amazes me sometimes, the things that she tells me. 

116.84 125.56 A: i know but you be so glad that they feel, you know, trust you enough to be able to come to you. i tell my daughter y- and my son you can talk

122.37 124.95 B: %oh, absolutely.

125.61 129.22 A: to me about anything. i do not care what it is. i do not care 

129.23 134.49 A: {breath} if you think it is embarrassing. i do not care what it is. you come to me with it.

132.24 138.27 B: it and that is so important and you know, {breath} %um, {lipsmack} so- some children they just, %um

138.28 140.38 B: they feel uncomfortable talking to their

140.39 145.98 B: parents about it or, {breath} you know, and and some parents have a closed mind. it is really important to keep an

145.99 149.41 B: open mind because {breath} the situation today is different from 

146.20 147.49 A: right.

149.54 152.42 A: when we were younger, really?

152.61 154.41 A: you do not sound it. {laugh} 

154.42 160.04 A: {breath} you sound like a young lady. you are you are still young, but i mean you sound younger than fifty.

149.58 158.32 B: {breath} i am i am fifty years old {breath} and and {laugh} the the, %aw, thank you, but 

159.51 165.31 B:  but you know when when i was growing up the situation was so totally different than today

165.34 170.26 B: {breath} and that is why you have to keep an open mind. you have to be receptive to what

170.27 173.90 B: society is today {breath} when you talk to your children,

173.96 181.50 B: because if you {breath} try to approach them based on what it was back when i was yo- it is so totally different.  

178.59 182.65 A: wow, {cough} it is so amazing. you sound just like me.

182.87 188.97 A: you know, cause like once the kids start having sex just because you say do not have sex, it is bad, you should wait until you get married {breath} 

188.98 191.67 A: you could catch a disease, all that stuff. you could say all of that, all

191.68 196.91 A: you want to, once they start having it just because you said do not do it does not mean they are not going to do it. {breath} 

196.92 200.23 A: you just educate them. {breath} teach them safe sex. 

196.04 199.42 B: is not that the truth? that is right.

200.28 204.10 A: you know, make sure that they do know about safe sex and they do know about diseases.

204.80 208.80 A: you know that you make sure they know everything that they supposed to know, because once 

208.86 212.72 A: they getting ready to do, there is nothing you, me, nobody, can do to stop them.

211.89 218.07 B: %oh, y- you are so right, and no matter, {breath} you know, no matter what what you want your children to do that

218.08 225.34 B: does not mean that that is what they are going to do it. {laugh} {breath} so, that is, you are absolutely right.

219.29 227.81 A: that is right. you plant the seed when they are young. you plant the seed when they are young and then l- later on in life 

227.87 235.21 A: they will use it. they will think about it. %oh, my mom taught me this. you know, that is the only way i know, because this is what my parents taught me.

228.45 230.65 B: you are absolutely

233.60 242.87 B: that is that is right. that is right. and, {breath} you know, if if  every parent felt the way you did we would not have half the problems we do today. {laugh} 

236.16 237.09 A: so,

241.40 248.76 A: ho- yeah, it would be so good because {breath} the kids feel really pressure and they get into a lot of stuff because they do not have nobody to understand them.

248.07 250.81 B: %oh, that is so true.

249.50 256.43 A: and they do not have nobody that they could go to and honestly, openly talk to, {breath} so they get into so many different things.

252.88 254.99 B: %oh, that i so true, and you know,

255.90 259.29 B: and and so many of the children they do not feel comfortable talking to their

259.30 263.92 B: parents so they talk to their friends in school {breath} and they are getting really, you know, they are not 

263.95 269.78 B: getting the right information, of course, you know, and and that leads to a lot of problems. {breath} but i know my daughter,

269.79 272.54 B: she she, like i said, we have a very open relationship, she 

264.67 267.03 A: mhm. nope.

272.58 278.22 B: talks to me and she tells me almost everything. {breath} and she says to me, she says to me, you know mom,

278.23 281.54 B: {breath} yo- none of my friends talk to their mothers like 

274.62 276.62 A: yeah, that is me and my daughter. {laugh} 

281.59 287.41 B: i talk to you. none of them my friends tell their the mothers all the stuff that i tell you. 

284.01 289.60 A: {lipsmack} that is me, too and, you know, a lot of my kids, a lot of my daughter's friends come to me.

289.80 298.87 A: i have a lot of kids that comes to me {breath} and and they want to talk to me becau- they say to me, i wish me and my mom could talk like me and you.

291.36 295.14 B: {lipsmack} %oh, i think that is so good.

298.64 302.59 B: {lipsmack} %oh, that is so good. {breath} that is so good and tha-

300.84 304.27 A: so me and my daughter's relationship was not always the way it is.

303.72 310.72 B: %oh, well, i know we had our problems, too. believe me. you know it is it is so difficult. 

308.07 315.45 A: but, %um, i glad that she is, you know, %um, sh- she is comfortable with me now. i and i really i really love my children.

311.77 313.54 B: mhm.

315.78 322.10 A: you know and i want to give my children the best life and i do not want sex to be, {breath} %um, a stumbling block for them.

322.20 329.01 A: you know, {breath} %um, so i definitely talk to my kids. my eight year old, i talk to him.

322.33 323.88 B: right.
