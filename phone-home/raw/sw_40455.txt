175.56 181.86 A: yeah, i am sure that that %uh %um i do not know what part of ^Philly, but i am sure there are some public schools in ^Philly that you do not want your kids to be anywhere near.

181.82 184.94 B: oh no i do not want them to go the schools that i went to

185.19 189.95 B: and i tell my son that all the time and my son is twelve years old, he is in the seventh grade getting ready to go in to eighth grade {breath} 

189.96 194.02 B: and i told him when i was coming up there was gangs, everything was in the school, you know?

200.52 201.16 A: that is good.

204.11 205.23 B: the schools i went to

205.37 207.66 B: soon as school was over they were kicking you out of the school

213.67 216.74 B: to put that, you know that effort forward and go ahead and do what they got to do,

217.55 223.56 A: you are absolutely right.  the best thing that i like about the ^Catholic school for my son is that every kid wears the exact same clothes to school every day.

218.89 219.65 B: you know?

222.96 227.32 B: right and that is what i told my son, i wish they would pass the law here in ^Philadelphia {breath}

227.32 233.67 B: that they would make it mandatory that they have to wear uniforms cause that is where all the confusion comes is at, {breath} you got these certain kids who 

233.87 237.98 B: are blessed that they were born with, you know, a silver spoon in their mouth, the parents came up with money

237.98 241.97 B: they come to school looking like a million dollars, you got these other kids, who don't look like that,

238.14 238.60 A: right

239.81 240.55 A: right

241.97 246.02 B: and the kids with money look down on them, pick on them, beat on them, do all kinds of stuff. {breath} 

246.03 252.36 B: if they all wearing the same thing they do not have nothing to look at each other, there is no animosity, is no this, no jealousy, no every, you know what i am saying?

246.07 246.70 A: {breath} right

252.17 253.61 A: alright is that a great idea

252.36 256.37 B: and the only thing they focusing on, that is right, and the only thing they focusing on is education
