82.19 89.24 B: like world like %um state wide and then they have like ^United ^States wide like my dad goes to all these different meetings all the time 

84.62 86.02 A: %oh okay

88.34 96.44 A: right %oh okay because i do i do i feel as though unions they do help the employees who you know {breath} only because they %um 

89.99 91.16 B: yeah

94.22 95.42 B: mhm

96.46 104.89 A: prime example i know %um certain people {breath} like %uh say for example someone does not get along with their boss and you know they don't see 

102.30 104.10 B: uh-huh

105.09 111.71 A: no kind of nobody sees no %uh no resolve in the situation then you can always go to the union if it gets really crucial 

110.12 111.68 B: mhm

111.95 119.87 A: you know where as the person like me {breath} if i have a problem with my supervisor then i will go to our boss {breath} then it might not be the same 

119.92 127.18 A: outcome you know i just might be fired when if i had a union i'll have somebody come in and represent me and my job might be saved 

120.29 121.76 B: mhm

123.27 124.46 B: yeah

127.06 131.05 B: and don't unions help in like when it is lay-offs and stuff if you are part of a union

127.32 127.95 A: you know

130.04 133.28 A: ri- exactly yeah

131.71 132.42 B: yeah

132.58 136.72 B: {breath} no i don't think i will be able to be a part of a union in my major because %um

135.65 137.77 A: no okay what is your major

137.51 138.67 B: accounting

138.19 140.55 A: %oh okay okay

139.25 144.47 B: so {breath} yeah i don't think i will be part i don't know i don't know if they have unions i guess it depends on where i work

141.54 142.52 A: %hm right

144.10 151.88 A:  %uh yeah that's that's true it all depends with company or something that you are with %um {lipsmack} might have a union then most then most

147.81 149.13 B: mhm

152.01 158.96 A:  accountants they really don't like you said so most likely you probably you will never be never be part of a union 

154.27 155.47 B: yeah

158.45 160.03 B: yeah

159.44 166.70 A: it but then again union has its pros and cons it's good but then again it's bad {breath} because more more smaller business %um 

163.42 164.81 B: yeah

167.43 173.89 A: {breath} they seem to be pretty much okay which i work for ^Liberty ^Mutual {breath} insurance company and %um 

171.54 172.70 B: mhm

174.24 180.40 A: they're pretty big company but they seem to do okay without a union you know {cough} 

177.63 183.31 B: yeah {breath} because like if unions go on strike you are part of that whether or not you want to be 

181.52 187.77 A: %uh yeah exactly see like my sister-in-law she is part of a union for ^Bell telephone and {breath} like when they go on strike 

185.77 186.76 B: mhm

187.88 194.45 A: it's hard crossing that picket line you know and when she has a daughter she pays for her daughter's catholic school and stuff like that %um

188.92 190.51 B: yeah

193.17 194.21 B: yeah

195.13 201.36 A: {lipsmack} i it's kind of it's kind of hard you have to bite the bullet either you know you don't want to cross the picket line but 

199.64 201.20 B: mhm

201.70 208.33 A: you know you do but you don't and it puts people in different situations because regardless you still have bills and everything to be paid 

202.94 204.08 B: yeah

207.52 209.29 B: yeah yeah

208.58 215.34 A: car notes and mortgages so it is kind of crucial (( )) i do admit that part you know

213.50 221.51 B: {breath} yeah i think i would have to like {breath} so ((i don't i don't)) you are not forced to be in the union if you work at a certain place right it is totally up to you

219.27 227.58 A: {lipsmack} {breath} no no because wh- years ago i use to work for ~UPS i was part of the union but i had an option not to be in the union {breath} but i  

226.34 229.96 B: [distortion] yeah i worked for ~UPS and i had the option to so

228.38 235.11 A: yeah and i chose to be in the union it was okay i did it for a little while {breath} %um i did not stick with ~UPS long 

231.55 232.41 B: mhm

234.74 236.11 B: yeah [background] 

235.25 241.15 A: because i was working three jobs because my other jobs {breath} now i worked i was working at that time i was working at %um 

236.61 237.76 B: yeah

241.67 246.38 A: {breath} ^Lerner's a women clothes store and they were union i was kind of surprised they were unionized

243.39 244.51 B: mhm

245.86 248.52 B: are they really i did not know that

246.95 256.54 A: yeah ^Lerner's matter of fact they were af- affiliated with %uh ^Shop ^In ^Bag employees they have a union i think they were all involved in the same union

256.16 257.40 B: %hm

257.16 262.32 A: yeah it was kind of weird i never knew a a a retail store whe- be union

261.77 266.12 B: yeah because i use to work for ^Express and i don't remember hearing anything about

264.56 267.72 A: no okay {breath} yeah ^Lerner's use to be union

267.26 268.49 B: no

268.64 275.78 A: [distortion] yeah that was a %uh that was i don't know and their union did not seem to be too active because we never did get any kind of like 

275.84 282.99 A: letters in the mail like little newsletters we did not get none of that stuff you know like regular unions do they didn't 

277.61 278.70 B: uh-huh

279.74 280.98 B: yeah

283.03 289.98 A: so they were not too active at least not whe- in in our area they weren't active at all you know %um 

284.32 285.14 B: uh-huh

286.61 287.77 B: yeah

290.31 297.62 A:  we had a older lady there {breath} she was like head of the union but Miss Miss %uh %uh %um {lipsmack} Miss Betty 

297.65 304.44 A: but she was like so up in age she wasn't really strong with it or keeping up to par with it so it was like 

302.38 303.94 B: yeah

304.49 311.56 A: you know you g- you taking union dues out and you are really not using the union and they are not sending you no like newsletters or anything like that

311.74 315.06 B: so you never know what is going on yeah

312.10 312.95 A: of that nature

313.14 319.99 A: yeah exactly so {breath} it was you know that was my experience with the union with %um ^Lerners and %um ~UPS

319.80 327.97 B: yeah i think i would have to like investigate like the union itself before i joined it because if it had like a high percentage of being on strike and stuff like that i would not want to chance it

320.88 321.71 A: [distortion] mhm

325.55 327.91 A: yeah d- exactly exactly

330.78 335.43 B: %oh really well that is a plus {laugh}
