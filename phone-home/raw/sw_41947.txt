29.21 34.69 A: [background/] if i think about it even more, it could go b- it could go both ways. i mean, a low profile case,

34.70 37.46 A: depending on the per- individual, i mean what is what is

37.51 43.37 A: the crime? i mean, who can decide, i mean who can decide what is is private or what is not?

43.52 49.93 A: i mean i i think as %uh in a free society we should be able to see certain things. i think ev- everything should not be hidden hidden from us.

50.07 53.76 B: yeah but any court case is public is a public ((info)) anyway.

53.67 59.78 A: {lipsmack} okay. and it is ((public)) on record right? that means you have you have to go back and research it.

56.64 57.72 B: yeah

59.65 60.78 B: mhm

60.64 66.29 A: but i mean to see it live and at the at the time that it is happening. would not that be more interesting?

67.87 73.96 B: {breath} %uh i think to me i am actually indifferent for for people's problems actually. 

74.31 79.25 B: maybe that is just my own personal position. i could not care less if it is televised or not.

79.26 82.44 B: yeah, it makes no difference to me.

74.06 75.72 A: okay

78.66 81.17 A: okay

82.82 93.41 B: {breath} but %eh one thing i do think is when it is televised it then has a tendency to (( )) prejudice or bias the judge, the jury, and everyone involved.

92.63 95.04 A: {breath}  

93.92 100.13 B: because the media can now give you a representation that makes you think %oh guilty as hell or vice versa.

101.11 105.00 B: {breath} you know some cases get ((moved)) simply because of that media attention.

101.12 102.92 A: okay

104.76 114.49 A: yeah, they give ((get them off of a)) different venue. yeah, i understand. they get them off a different venue. which in in (( )) many cases is true because a person can get a ((trail)) a fair trial.

106.44 107.48 B: yeah

114.87 116.34 A: %um

116.91 121.69 A: i guess (( )) i guess the main one they can speak of would be the ~OJ case. 

121.73 122.62 B: mhm

122.19 130.70 A: in are you %uh %uh if you are familiar with that ((or know)) anything about that. that was that was that was very high highly publicized. i personally

124.52 126.38 B: (( )) very

128.08 129.43 B: mhm

130.74 138.49 A: would not have %um wanted to show that. but i also believe that, i personally believe that he was not %uh that he was innocent.

138.74 140.16 B: you believe he was innocent. 

139.88 141.03 A: yeah

140.55 147.89 B: okay but now you from what the the way it was exposed they said the opposite. the media was saying something else.

148.02 149.34 A: yeah  

149.82 162.50 A: y- y- yeah i i but i was looking at i was trying to make a (( )) i was trying to keep it was not just ~OJ or anybody, as far as the case would go. i guess they i guess they really wanted to know because it was a high profile person.

155.96 156.99 B: mhm

158.17 159.11 B: mhm

162.76 170.02 B: {breath} because and here is another thing, for the mere fact that it is high profile a lot of people immediately think, %oh he is rich, he has got to be guilty.

164.35 166.07 A: {breath} 

169.60 177.54 A: yeah, okay. that is true. i mean that is really %uh, conventionally, %uh hard thing to (( )) people just sort of pre-judge. they do not know

177.55 185.20 A: and you have to really look at the whole facts. and then you have to say well okay, look at the whole facts, and what has been presented and what has not been presented.

180.37 181.38 B: mhm

186.22 193.44 A: %um the reason i say that i do not think he was guilty is because i do not think one person can kill two people real quick and get away.

193.01 202.28 B: {laugh} that is true but then he ha- the way i believe it he had something to do with it. he knows about it or somewhere along the line he was involved.

198.51 200.12 A: {lipsmack}   

202.09 204.87 A: %oh yeah, m- maybe not with the physical aspect

204.56 205.49 B: mhm

205.36 214.35 A: but maybe it was something that was under the table, or you know correlating or ((anything)) ((but i mean)) something that was %uh you know that was 

214.36 223.39 A: under you know, under the table that was that was happening. i think that was happening. %uh i think a lot of a lot of the profile high profile case then how do you how

218.48 219.77 B: mhm

223.40 231.71 A: do you satisfy the public curiosity? i mean how do how do you how do you make it fair where everyone can see? i mean what do you do?

232.14 233.60 B: how do you do what?

232.43 238.64 A: {breath} i mean they say if they do not profile a case, they do not show it. how do you establish

238.65 247.27 A: the guilt or non-guilt even if it was not a high profile case ((or for a high)) profile individual, just an an average person, an average everyday person that is working?

248.22 253.45 B: i mean regardless they will establish guilt or innocence whatever the case high or low profile.

253.12 258.91 A: okay. but it should. ((the the the re- the)) guilt should be ((proven)) beyond a reasonable doubt.

258.49 259.75 B: true

259.72 267.48 A: so %uh it is %um %uh [distortion] it it is always very very controversial.

267.28 268.46 B: yeah

267.85 274.23 A: %eh you you you know and i i would not ((watch)) wish anyone to go to prison or to be accused of anything that they did not do.

274.74 278.73 A: i think everyone deserves a fair trial, you know?

274.16 275.23 B: mhm

276.75 277.65 B: right

278.44 284.26 B: but the media ((events)) with ~OJ surrounding the ~OJ case was more like he bought his way out of trouble.

283.12 290.38 A: yeah, yeah, that is true. because he had a high profile lawyer and (( )) he had a lot of money and stuff.

292.12 298.50 A: which in fact, you know, however it went, you know and %uh %ah it is really a shame. {laugh}

298.51 303.40 A: it is %uh %uh i think ((knowing)) i think the the ones who really got hurt a lot were the children.

297.70 298.57 B: mhm

303.50 304.49 B: yeah

303.72 309.06 A: because they had they had to go that they had to go through that. and i think it was ((so good)) i do not think i would want to put my children through that.

309.83 313.71 A: i think that was so wrong. and that was the main thing.

311.23 312.34 B: mhm

314.10 320.80 A: and then and then regardless, you know you have a parent who has lost a child. you know, their their mother is gone

320.81 324.93 A: and %uh now no one knows.

318.75 319.97 B: (( ))

326.71 328.83 A: so they will, you know.

329.51 333.50 A: just hope that i mean like i said, there is a whole lot about that case. {breath} [/background] 

333.66 334.63 B: yeah
