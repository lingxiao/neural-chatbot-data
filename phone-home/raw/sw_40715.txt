24.81 27.47 B: you know choosing the right school to go to

24.95 26.46 A: yeah but just

27.32 34.03 A: %um okay %em you have been through the process and i have been through the process by sending one.

30.92 32.35 B: {breath} 

32.80 40.36 B: well i am i am about to go through the process again because unfortunately

35.47 36.56 A: {laugh} 

40.01 42.70 A: %ah okay, what is your major?

41.55 45.53 B: {breath} {lipsmack} %uh i am a marketing major. {lipsmack} yeah

43.35 44.81 A: ^Marketing.

45.61 51.82 A: so %uh as a transfer student, you should be able to get into the college of your choice. 

51.58 59.79 B: {breath} %um yeah i am trying to get my ~GPA raise that up a little bit before i transfer to make sure i can get a scholarship.

60.35 68.52 B: you know that is definitely a factor you want to look into when you are transferring you do not want to have that you know big debt hanging over your head, have to take out loans.

60.52 62.45 A: uh-huh

67.09 70.87 A: {breath} {laugh} 

69.39 72.41 B: {breath} [background] ((cause i))

71.08 78.29 A: alright, well {breath} i think we are supposed to {lipsmack} at least discuss you know %uh the process that

78.78 85.74 A: {breath} that i guess you would advise your child even though you know {laugh} {breath} you you are going 

79.36 80.45 B: mhm

83.70 92.75 B: {breath} well, actually what i would advise my child to do is to like first of all is to apply to a lot of schools {breath} not just one or two

93.73 104.98 B: because when you apply to more than one then you know you have a lot more options. you know apply to some close at home, some far away, some private institutions, some public institutions {breath} to vary it up.

105.53 111.34 B: you know that way when you you know when you get your packages back and you are looking at the information that the colleges are offering 

111.44 116.78 B: {breath} you you have more of a choice and a selection and you can actually sit down and say okay no i do not want to go to this one 

117.28 120.67 B: %uh you know and that way you can sit down and have some choices and options

121.31 130.24 A: well i that is that is definitely something that you should do, %um however if you are looking for specific colleges   

121.56 123.83 B: that is just, [background] mhm.

125.14 126.60 B: {lipsmack} yeah

130.25 142.51 A: or you know %uh or certain s- you know fields of study or people that are you s- know colleges that are supposed to be very good you know for engineering or for business

132.04 135.37 B: {lipsmack} right but see the {lipsmack} 

142.00 143.04 B: [background] mhm

143.66 149.03 A: you have to you have to just apply it to those also you know you you cannot

143.69 145.99 B: {breath} yes {cough} 

147.47 156.39 B:  %oh right yeah i think he should apply to many different schools but see the thing is {breath} y- what do you really know when you are coming right out of the twelfth grade ? yeah, you say you want to be an 

156.40 164.89 B:  engineer, but you know if you get stuck in a school that is just for engineering {breath} and you decide that is not for you then you are going to have a really difficult time 

165.33 166.98 A: that

165.51 170.05 B: you know transferring to another school or switching your major and things like that 

170.65 174.34 A: {breath} that is true. yeah. i agree with that. %um

174.69 180.78 A: my son happened to %um want to be an an engineering major.

180.38 181.72 B: mhm

181.33 189.02 A: and he started out in ^Cornell and right and then he decided he wanted to go to ^Virginia.

184.69 186.33 B: ^Cornell, mhm

189.06 190.73 B: {lipsmack} ^Virginia ^Tech

190.16 193.54 A: no, the ^University ^of ^Virginia. {laugh} {breath} 

192.22 193.85 B: %oh okay

193.59 201.71 A: and the only way somebody from ^New ^Jersey can get into that college is by transferring.

201.48 203.89 B: right, mhm

202.26 209.66 A: you know and he was just very lucky to transfer because they do not i think they accept maybe a hundred people a year.

209.80 214.31 A: you know it is very diffi- very difficult to get in from out of state.

210.07 211.16 B: that are

213.89 215.25 B: mhm

216.21 219.07 A: so, you know. {breath} 

219.17 229.72 A: if you are stuck with a major and he actually changed . he switched from engineering to {laugh} economics {laugh} {breath} while while while he was there, {breath} you know.

224.27 227.68 B: [background] really? see {breath} 

228.36 234.58 B: m- yeah see that is what i mean it is like you know you do not want to get %uh stuck in school in a school that only specializes in one thing

234.30 237.85 A: yeah (( )) exactly

235.56 241.34 B: so, that way [background] you can easily switch majors without having to switch schools which is good

240.29 243.25 A: {breath} 

241.65 245.27 B: because a lot of times when you are switching schools you lose a lot of your credits  

246.37 247.51 B: sometimes (( ))

246.97 251.78 A: %ah yeah, you have to check that way ahead of time you know.

249.77 250.66 B: [distortion] yeah

251.10 252.76 B: yeah, uh-huh

251.99 259.73 A: even even if you have taken courses in high school that you think you are going to get college credits for them a lot of the schools will not accept them.

260.05 261.68 B: yeah, they sure will not

260.66 264.95 A: yeah you you should check that before you even apply to the school, you know.

264.65 265.83 B: mhm

266.71 275.70 B: but %um and like also when you are applying you know a lot of people say you know i think i would advise my child to at least take the ~SATs two or three times.

275.50 281.67 A: {breath} %oh absolutely absolutely. i think what are you starting tenth grade taking them?

277.65 279.31 B: and %uh {breath} 

280.29 285.77 B: {breath} i think in the tenth grade you take the ~PSATs, the preparatory ~SAT test

285.98 292.25 B: and then like in the eleventh grade that is when you would take the actual ~SAT and take it two or three times.

291.60 300.34 A: [background] yeah yeah that that is a plus. {breath} although they claim they do not use that as any weight but i think that is a lot of bologna.

295.32 295.97 B: yeah

298.72 309.16 B: {breath} {lipsmack} %um i do not think well ac- some schools actually have a minimum. if you do not have a certain (( )) percent on your ~SAT score they do not even admit you.

309.21 310.53 A: %huh

309.79 314.30 B: because i know ~NYU the %ah minimum is i think about eleven hundred.

314.56 316.94 A: yeah, and it

315.72 324.82 B: and %ah and also even if they do not use that as criteria to get into their school, they do use that as criteria for awarding scholarships. 

324.68 326.12 A: uh-huh
