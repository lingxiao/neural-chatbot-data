43.64 45.92 B: {laugh} {breath} yeah, i

44.06 48.87 A: you know what i mean? i i would be like hey, %uh you know, the, thanks, thanks, but no thanks, you know, i do not know.

48.66 57.54 B:  yeah, especially if it happened to me. if i knew that it was a volcano not too far from here and i and that someone had an opportunity to save,

57.54 67.33 B: you know, a a whole lot of us. i mean i look at it from not only just mine, you know, i look at it if i were in that person's shoes, if i were a victim of it.

66.33 78.92 A: right, exactly, if there is a whole city full of people like me or just me. that is okay. you know, i i i will go. i will sacrifice myself for the greater good. it it is easy to say that though, but i guess if they gave you the choice maybe you would be like no way man

91.57 100.82 A:  i guess because it is our it says local airport like, maybe that is supposed to make us think some of those people could be our friends or relatives, but it is the same thing. i mean it is all.

94.44 96.14 B: {lipsmack} uh-huh.

101.32 108.20 A: i do not know and they picked ^Montserrat. i do not, where is that? in the %uh, is not that in the ^Caribbean somewhere? it is an island. i do not even know where ^Montserrat is.

108.19 110.27 B: yeah, i am not sure, i

108.80 115.29 A: but i i think they picked that on purpose so we would sit there and go, %oh, too bad for those for people let them burn %uh, %uh, %uh, %uh, save my friend.

213.95 215.39 B: {laugh} 

217.23 224.70 A: i see those people, you know, you know how it is at ^Omnipoint, you know some people and then you see all these other people walking around and you are not quite sure who they all are, but, %um.

235.84 237.16 A: (( ))

238.65 244.12 A: a lot of them come, now they do, though, because, you know everybody uses our copier now. they they opened up that room for cop- for let them use the copier.

243.94 245.92 B: yeah.

244.38 249.03 A: so if you ever had to use the copier, that is that is our office. we sit right there, so, %oh, whatever.

247.83 250.24 B: the old [background] yeah.

250.02 256.68 A: %ah, but i do not know. this this th- that is funny that this is your first call because the the very first call i ever had was the same topic.

256.97 265.81 A: so, now, mayb- for all i know maybe they put them in order. i do not know. maybe there is some kind of order to them, but this was the first one i ever had that i received, because i made, this is the first time i ever made a call was today. 

256.99 258.40 B: %oh, it is the same topic?

265.82 272.15 A: and it is the first time you ever got one and the first time i ever got one was the same thing about the volcano and me and the person i talked to said

266.19 267.03 B: yeah.

270.51 277.68 B: {laugh} it would be weird if, like i will call someone and it will be their first time and we will have this topic. {laugh} 

274.37 282.15 A: you will get the volcano {laugh} and you would. you will say the same thing again like, it is supposed to be [distortion] this long discussion but it takes about a minute. you go, you know what?

282.16 286.76 A: i would stop the volcano. how about you? yeah, and that is it. you are done talking about it. there is nothing else to say. 

285.43 289.39 B: {laugh} yeah.

287.96 296.22 A: so, i am glad there is other people just starting because i have only made, this is my, %ah, fourth call. so, i was starting to think maybe they would be running out. there would not be any more money to go around. [distortion] i guess not.

296.52 298.19 B: %oh, really?

296.74 305.60 A: because i am i am afraid, i do not know. sooner or later they are going to cut it off, i guess. i do not know, and i let it go. i let it go two days and i did not make one. so, i forgot. so, who knows? 

303.91 310.87 B: {lipsmack} yeah, i forgot, too. i i carried this thing around in my pocket and the @PIN number, and then i i 

309.71 316.01 A: well it took them forever to send. they mailed it to me and it took them forever and other other people i know got it right away but they mailed it to me. 

314.73 317.62 B: see, i i still do not have it.

317.37 319.54 A: %oh, you do not, %oh, they gave it to you over the phone. 

319.23 321.63 B: yeah, they gave it to me by telephone.

320.56 331.21 A: %oh, see, at least they did that. for me they did not do that. she said you will get in the mail in a day or two and it was like, probably a week and, i mean i signed up the first day and it was like a week and a half until i even got the thing in the mail. [/background]
