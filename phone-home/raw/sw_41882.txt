186.72 187.76 B: mhm.

189.39 196.40 A: a different operating system once i got it and it was a problem because it was so new, the hardware on it was so new

196.95 203.92 A: that the, %ah, it was hard to get like all the drivers or whatever i needed to to make it work with the new operating system {breath} and

204.28 216.36 A: it is like if i wanted to get, %uh, something that was that is like, well known, and that has been around awhile, and everybody has tried it out, and they recommend it and all, {breath} and i go to buy something, and i can not get it because they do not make those anymore.
