yeah i think you are right there </s>
pl yeah pl playing a game uh something that is uh basically fun um they should be kind of thankful for that but hm then i guess on the one hand it is like uh you know the owners and whoever runs the leagues are making like tons of money so um lipsmack you should get a fair share </s>
yeah </s>
but um breath actually i think going back to the basketball players i think they were a little out of line because ah i think they were making pulling almost as much as the revenue as ah the owners were and i think that was not right </s>
yeah </s>
uh but i think they sh they should be happy with what they get they make lipsmack googobs of money laugh </s>
yeah breath well i think everybody everybody has a right to strike you know if you are unhappy but you know </s>
googobs mhm mhm </s>
i mean how can you be unhappy when you are making that much money but you know i mean they have the right i guess laugh </s>
lipsmack right yeah it is it is it is yeah it is part of our ah yeah american right to strike </s>
was not there just a referee strike that was going to happen </s>
yeah the and um which league </s>
was not that in baseball they were just threatening to strike this year </s>
oh yeah yeah yeah um i forget why but yeah ah as a matter of fact they fired a lot of them too i think they did strike </s>
yeah yeah they ha </s>
and they fired them all um except for like a few of them </s>
and then they they just ah hired extra refs to do the world series or something </s>
yeah they did fire mhm yeah they just hired extra refs i do not think they even hired the ones they fired um i think they fired all of them ex i think they fired all of them that went on strike then they hired back like twenty five for some reason and then the rest were just ah yeah they left hanging </s>
yeah i am sure that they have the i mean i i agree with them striking though i mean you know they got to deal with a lot of crap so </s>
uh without jobs mhm yeah exactly </s>
you know </s>
exactly </s>
but i do not know how the ah oh well do you watch baseball or basketball or what sport are you into </s>
um i do not watch baseball too much um i do watch basketball i kind of like the wh yeah to watch things are baseball l m moves a little bit too slow for me </s>

see i guess i i like the i like like the college basketball and i like i like wnba </s>
mhm breath </s>
you know as opposed to regular basketball </s>
right </s>
but that is just it is just because um the players do not get paid </s>
mhm </s>
or get paid that much like the average salary for wnba is like thirty thousand </s>
how much </s>
thirty thousand </s>
that is it </s>
yeah so i guess i you know i guess you know there is not as much grandstanding or whatever i do not know i work for um </s>

no i i agree i mean i don't i don't know um too much about it because i've been out of school for so long but i think especially um certain high schools </s>
mhm </s>
i it just seems like you see more of the students outside the highschool than inside </s>
exactly exac </s>
and there i don't think there's any supervision and um i don't know i feel like a parent but um laugh i i it's just interesting um </s>
laugh </s>
y you know i you just don't see any supervision at all and it it's it's a shame i think it depends on the area </s>
mhm </s>
where the school is also </s>
uh uh-huh </s>
um i don't know i mean i </s>
i i i totally agree yeah breath </s>
you know i don't i don't know what schools are around i live in center city i don't know what public schools are around me not too many </s>
uh-huh </s>
um </s>
well i i i i actually live right across the street from one and to tell you the truth it's like one of the worst schools i've ever seen it's like people are constantly out i i think it's actually half eh high school and uh eh grade school combined </s>
what school </s>
and ho hold on i'm sorry eh i'm on the phone tell her i'll call back um i think it's eh samuel douglas it's a public school and uh i think it's it's in it's in port richmond </s>
where is that i don't know where that is okay </s>
that's where i live at port richmond </s>
right </s>
it's uh it's just like there's i i think it's actually for like really really bad kids so i i guess i think another good reason why it's so bad </s>
right </s>
but there's so many kids like outside like smoking pot and just just you know like gambling outside just so much different than i think in my opinion then catholic school breath unbelievable </s>
well it's interesting i was um as an e through the uh pennsylvania bar association they have this mentor program breath and you get paired up with someone </s>
uh-huh </s>
who is in um someone not that they have problems but someone who's like an okay student but kind of on the borderline you know like maybe not a great homelife and we would ha i got paired up </s>
uh-huh </s>
with someone at um lipsmack i forget the school it was actually in port richmond um breath i forget the name of the school </s>
really </s>
hensfiel no it was in the philadelphia school system and it it was a middle school </s>
mhm </s>
and it was interesting i mean the outside looks like a prison but you go in and it's like i it's huge and every teacher has a walkie-talkie it's like very i i it's interesting </s>
really </s>
and i don't know if it's because because the kids are younger that i it's more strict but breath um </s>
mhm </s>
it it's like everyone's just got the walkie-talkie and you know where everyone is at all times so that that's different than what i'm used to you know what i'm used to seeing </s>
yeah def yeah </s>
i i thought so </s>
i like the like the highschool i went to i mean i w i went to roman catholic that's in center city i mean th th they just i i th th they just treat you totally different they just treat you more like uh young men instead of like like prisoners you know </s>
right laugh </s>
laugh i mean i just like see how some kids are treated in in public school i like and it's just ah ah ah it's oh my gosh my other phone line i don't think i can answer it </s>

yeah </s>
because they try and mainstream them but it's really hurting i it's really hurting </s>
that's a shame </s>
the the people that really have learning problems and shouldn't be in in a class </s>
mhm </s>
with people that can keep up with their you know with whatever the curriculum is for that age </s>
it's pretty surpri eh eh eh you said north penn tha that's like far that's like ah that's suburbia um suburban </s>

laugh </s>
laugh breath so anyway we're supposed to be discussing um foreign languages in college </s>
yeah </s>
is that what you yeah that was what the recording told you </s>
yeah yeah </s>
yeah okay now i think that's a very good idea and i and they said what what what we think would be you know the best language n now i would say spanish because that's universal </s>
right yes i totally agree </s>
i don't know if you right and uh when i went to school uh grade school they didn't ha they it wasn't required to have a uh a language you know a second language but now i i understand they want the children to learn at least spanish </s>
right </s>
in grade school </s>
oh yeah um i know when my kids go to school i really hope that they learn a second language and </s>
mhm </s>
breath yeah spanish would be the most um i think um what's the word i'm looking for here uh </s>
yeah the the most universal language that everybody speaks </s>
yeah yeah exactly </s>
right and then i don't know what the next one would be i don't know if it would be french or um gosh i really couldn't say what the next language would be but they said i think a a couple languages or something colleges should teach </s>
i think french would be nice yeah </s>
french yeah that's what i would say yeah i </s>
french or italian </s>
so uh yeah and i think uh with the children or i shouldn't say the children but the college age uh people they should have that because the more of course the more you know the better off you'll be in the world nowadays you know </s>
yeah </s>
the more knowledge you know of anything you're ah you're on track just like with computers nowadays everybody must know computers laugh if you don't you can't get a good job laugh </s>
that's true laugh breath this is true yeah laugh they're everywhere laugh an </s>
and they're everywhere and my son knows everything you want to know about computers and to tell you the truth he learned eh when he was two years old on a calculator </s>
lipsmack ah </s>
yeah my hu now he's twenty he's going to be twenty nine years old next next week and breath when he was two years old he learned how to use a calculator </s>
mhm </s>
and from there there on he had these little hand held computer games </s>
mhm </s>
and uh he just went from that and then and then my husband bought him uh like a little cheapy computer and he just got interested in it through the years and now he's a computer networker </s>
oh that's great </s>
yeah and he travels around and he troubleshoots computers and and breath uh he went down to virginia where his wife lives his wife's parents live and he set up all the whole computer system for the new school that they built down there </s>
mhm </s>
so that that so he was told that that's a good one to put on his resume laugh </s>
oh yeah definitely breath well that's what my boyfriend does and um he is now working for um a brokerage part of a large bank in our area yeah i mean </s>
oh boy uh-huh that's nice </s>
yeah and the more you know the further you go with computers laugh breath </s>
that's the truth and i'm and i'm sure they they they want you we have to get back to the subject of the foreign language laugh </s>
laugh breath </s>
so you know i guess the i think the computers do have the foreign language uh um programs in them too </s>
oh i know even my phone does i could i could get everything in my phone in french or spanish or english laugh </s>
yeah right isn't that isn't that amazing i tell you what modern technology does </s>
breath yeah yeah it's great </s>
now do you have an do you have an omnipoint cell phone </s>
yes i do </s>
yeah i i just purchased one last thursday </s>
mhm </s>
and this is how i found out the information about the calling you know the twelve dollar per cal </s>
lipsmack yeah </s>
twelve dollar per call and uh i like my omnipoint laugh it's </s>
laugh breath which phone did you get </s>
eh i got the ericsson </s>
lipsmack oh yeah yeah </s>
yeah i have the ericsson and like i said i like the uh omnipoint um the package plan or whatever you want to call it you know what i mean </s>
mhm </s>
and uh it's uh i had comcast before and it was very expensive the roaming charges and the uh uh air line charges uh </s>
oh yeah the flat fees are great with omnipoint </s>
oh that yeah so like i said i just got it on thursday and i and i love it already it's the the clarity is perfect </s>
yeah </s>
so uh yeah </s>
the digital yeah that's great </s>
and i like the idea to have call eh not call-waiting i have call waiting on it but i also have voice mail </s>
yeah </s>
and that's great because on my other phone that i had with comcast i didn't have it and and people said where were you i've been trying to reach you what's the purpose of having cell phones </s>
laugh </s>
if i can't get a hold of you laugh so now i have the uh voice mail on my cell phone it's it's terrific </s>
yeah i have a nortel it's actually a very old model that they don't make anymore but </s>
mhm </s>
it still works and i love it laugh </s>
that's alright there's not no nothing wrong with that </s>
no laugh </s>
now my older model with comcast it was a heavier model and it was heavy in my handbag now this one's small and and lightweight so this is </s>
yeah </s>
cheaper it's like like no no heavier than like my cosmetic case </s>
yeah laugh </s>
so like i said i love </s>
yeah i have foun i have found it so difficult i have i have tried making five different phone calls and i've never gotten anyone </s>
that's int i just did it like just a little while ago and i was like no one wants to talk to me laugh </s>
laugh yeah i have no idea how many people are in are are are in this pilot study at all </s>
right right i know a lot of </s>
it doesn't sound it </s>
i was go </s>
it doesn't seem like there's a lot </s>
i was gonna say a lot of people at omnipoint i know called in last night to just you know get the extra cash so i'm sure there's gonna be a whole slew of those people i'm waiting to s get somebody i know </s>
yeah you'll probably end up with voices you recognize laugh </s>
right exactly exactly um act </s>
hey um i i i don't know about this question but i had a question on the l last one which was kind of neat it was it was if they offered you a million dollars </s>
uh-huh </s>
and but the stipulation was you couldn't live in the united states </s>
uh-huh </s>
would you take it and where would you go </s>
oh my gosh where would i go oh my god </s>
but the first thing was would you take it because you could never come back </s>
i could never come back </s>
no </s>
could my family come to me </s>
sure </s>
if my family could come to me i'd go probably hm i don't know where i'd go probably to some island i'd probably go veg on some island like aruba </s>
go veg laugh on an island the rest of your life </s>
laugh i'd sit on an island for the rest of my l i could do that laugh </s>
oh okay </s>
i think i could i don't know maybe but probably end up probably because i'd probably get bored th after because i'm very like breath i don't know i like doing i'm always like in the middle i work in advertising so i'm constantly on the go but that would probably drive me crazy after two weeks i'd probably get breath </s>
probably yeah </s>
i'd probably end up in probably italy or paris you know france or something along those lines </s>
there you go </s>
so what about yourself </s>
uh yeah i'd do it in a heartbeat because i don't want to end up spending my whole life in this country anyway </s>
uh right right right </s>
and right now i'd probably go to ireland since that's </s>
ireland i hear it's beautiful there </s>
yeah that's where my family's from yeah it is beautiful there </s>
i hear that's what um one of the girls here that i work with was like oh i was there when i was younger and i want to go back and i was just like oh i'm like but it makes me little nervous about all the you know i w the one part of ire ireland's fine but the other part isn't and that she was telling me how there were guns where she was and i was like oh my god breath </s>
well yeah i was up in belfast already and i i didn't i didn't go to the uh outlying towns at all </s>
got it </s>

so i'm kind of like um </s>
uh what it was comcast or at and t or someone like that you know they're putting together international footprints </s>
well i remember that i was in my living room watching a recorded movie um actually a movie in the vcr and we just turned off the the video and the tv came up and all of a sudden they had this news flash it was like one o'clock in the morning or something and they just were showing all this stuff and said that she i guess by then she had actually died and um we were just in total shock </s>
yeah yeah </s>
it was pretty wild </s>
um what day what what what day was that do you remember i mean what month or what time of the year was it </s>
um it was i think it was late august and i'm pretty sure it was </s>
hm </s>
it was late s uh on a saturday night or very early i guess on a sunday morning in paris </s>
yeah </s>
and um so it was pretty close to pretty close to labor day weekend </s>
yeah i do recall really i do recall when um when it happened i just don't remember exactly what date and where i was i i i think i was home </s>
yeah </s>
when tha when i found out about it </s>
yeah </s>
you know obviously </s>
i think most people heard about it on like sunday morning news or in the sunday papers or whatever since it happened so late at night </s>
yeah i'm sure i heard it the day it happened </s>
yeah </s>
you know because i'm always not always watching tele television but um uh i have my my work desk right there in front of the tv so </s>
uh-huh </s>
i'm kind of always in tune with a lot of things that are going on </s>
yeah </s>
so what features do you have on your phone you have any like news flashes or anything </s>
no nothing like that actually i just use it to call home and tell my hubby where i'm gonna be and all that kind of stuff so </s>
well well you get a free one </s>
a free what a free feature </s>
y y yeah you get in other words and other than the features that you normally get which is you know your call-waiting and all that distortion </s>
yeah </s>
um unless you have some kind of different system up there but you should have some kind of you sh you have a option to get a free news flash like fox news headlines </s>
uh-huh </s>
sports and uh tv general stuff and the way to do that you have a computer at home </s>
yeah </s>
go into omnipoint's uh site </s>
yep </s>
uh omnipoint dot com i guess it is </s>
uh-huh </s>
and you'll go to the area you'll find it you'll go to the area for customer service and all </s>
yeah </s>
and you can actually online put that information in </s>
wow i'll </s>
be because you do get a free one a ne you know you got a choice of four of them i think it is and what it does it's kind of it's kind of bo-bo but it's it's pretty neat it flashes up headline news stuff during the day about three times a day </s>
cool i'll have to check that out </s>
yeah an you know i think you could even go on and actually uh change your whole service if you wanted to </s>
probably </s>
you know but i haven't really tried that i actually ah am a i'm a corporate account representative for this area up in northeast pennsylvania </s>
uh-huh </s>
so you're talking to someone that actually sell these phones </s>
yeah well i guess you would know then </s>
you know breath but the uh topic uh do we have to talk about diana all the time or is it jus </s>
well i think for some of the time i was told when i signed up </s>
you know </s>
for the survey that um if you couldn't find something to talk about or you couldn't figure out what to say about the topic that was involved then </s>
mhm </s>
you could talk about other stuff but um </s>
well we talked about it </s>
it's funny that you mentioned the news it's funny that you mentioned the news headlines because um the whole diana thing it's very rare for us to actually have the television on and you know when it comes up after the vcr turns off it it's pretty rare that we actually get a channel we don't even have cable so it's you know it's rare that we actually get a station that comes in and to see that coming up just when it happened was really wild </s>
oh you don't have why why don't you have cable it's not in your area </s>
um well we just d we decided that we didn't want to pay for it because we're you know we're rarely home actually watching tv since we both work and are in school and stuff </s>
yeah yeah okay yeah </s>
so we just figured we'd rather spend the money on doing stuff like going out to dinner once a week and all that kind of thing </s>
laugh hey get a get the dish you ever thought about that cough </s>
um well kind of but we'd have to put it on the roof of our apartment building or on the fire escape or something we just </s>

yeah i won i i wonder um if i i ever had to do something like that if it would i mean i would imagine it would certainly depend on the circumstances i mean for example i think that there may be a a difference if if the pedestrian that they used in that example would have been killed or if they were injured </s>
mhm </s>
i don't i don't know wh do you think you would have a a varying degree there i mean i- or would you just i don't know for example in that ah in that ah example i'm not </s>

hopefully yeah </s>
it'll work out in laugh it'll it'll work it'll it'll work out in the long run that's you know that's just just just how i feel </s>

well i i would i i'd feel the same way </s>
over me </s>
i wouldn't want to put anybody else uh on the hook </s>
yeah i mean especially if it were something that that uh that bad breath um </s>
well see uh that doesn't that uh doesn't that uh breath doesn't that make that person uh an uh an abettor you know somebody who bet on the uh crime </s>
breath wait did that make that person a what </s>
doesn't it yeah breath doesn't that make that person an accomplice to the uh crime or </s>
yeah i mean especially if it's if it's knowledge uh beforehand yeah i mean if they're they they i think one of the the the difficult parts would be if say they had that car situation breath and they weren't really paying attention either then it's kind of both of you weren't paying attention </s>
hm </s>
who necessarily to blame i guess the person who's driving but breath and the other person really i it could be bent around because they technically could say you you were in better control than they were so you weren't fully sound really i guess you you could stretch the truth in that respect </s>
yup yeah you know yeah but basically the passenger is responsible he a passenger is a passenger </s>
yeah it's true that's true </s>
uh you know it it's not his job to keep his eyes on the road and breath and watch the traffic </s>
no i mean yeah i i agree with that but i mean some other people might use that so much as a defense saying that the passenger was the one who was distracting the driver so it was more the passenger's fault </s>
oh oh oh ye oh distracting by talking or something </s>
is it yeah and then they </s>
well yeah </s>
so they could try and shift the blame off of the driver because then the passenger can't just be you know ah arbitrarily charged with that you know when sitting on the in court on the stand so </s>
uh-huh </s>
breath i don't know </s>
well </s>
laugh </s>
even see even even even so i think the uh passe or driver if the driver's in control when if somebody's making too much noise he should just say look hold it down a little bit so i can concentrate on my driving a little better </s>
yeah of course and i agree with you techni i mean ah wholeheartedly in that situation that would be ah that would be a difficult one difficult one definitely breath so </s>
uh-huh </s>
yeah i mean i don't ha i i take it that's never happened to you </s>
no no </s>
laugh no it hasn't happened to me either laugh </s>
no thank god i hope hope that it won't happen </s>
breath so laugh yeah i'm glad this is just a hypothetical one huh laugh so </s>
lipsmack yeah yeah yeah everything is easy and hypothetical until it it it becomes real </s>
that's true that's true i i mean i i was actually just driving about half an hour ago yeah the situation seems ripe for breath you know minor accidents like this and there's so many things that grab your attention just driving i was in i was in center city </s>
mhm </s>
i mean it's it's like a minefield of people </s>
it is </s>
i mean even if you're going yeah today for some reason i guess because of all the construction going down here from thirty-eighth on down on to chestnut and down into center city is just terrible </s>
hm mhm </s>
and you know i mean even if you're going five miles an hour you can still seriously hurt someone and then you know i know some people would really try to get out of that and hell what about the people who try to flee the scene </s>
that's right i remember year </s>
you know </s>
i remember years ago i was working down in washington </s>
y huh </s>
and i had been somewhere i'm coming home uh at night and i guess i'm in the block before the block in which i lived all of a sudden a dog uh darted out in front of my car and i hit him </s>
mhm </s>
and uh he tumbled away you know and i stopped the car i got out meanwhile a woman came out of her house you know and she's screaming but uh as it turned out the dog was alright i guess he was he was more you know i just tapped him and he </s>
uh-huh </s>
i guess he was more scared than he was uh anything else </s>
uh-huh </s>
but uh you know i had the worst feeling </s>
breath yeah that wouldn't be </s>
you know because because because i know uh you know how i would feel you know if it were my dog or my uh pet </s>
yeah and i i i believe you in that situation especially when it's difficult to drive around in the city breath and i you know i i've pretty much come to the realization that if i ever hit anyone breath and even if they i mean even if they haven't been seriously hurt i'm probably not going to drive again for months </s>
no this is my second call here </s>
okay well let us get to it i guess that is what we are being paid for </s>
yeah uh university extracurricular programs i think that uh uh male cheerleading is definitely a waste of extracurricular activity </s>
breath really breath </s>
familiar with the male cheerleading </s>
i know i have seen male cheerleaders i never went to a school that that i that i that i knew of that had them but uh why do you feel that males should uh is a waste of activity </s>
well t t uh because i th i recently found out that uh penn state was offering ah scholarships for kids to go under male cheerleading and i felt that those scholarships could better be served eh by breath an academic or a ah person of lower income to get those scholarships </s>
ah jeeze i i see your point but i do not think i agree with you and i am not saying that just to be controversial and to have something to talk about for the next six minutes breath but it strikes me that any any tool that gets you into college uh i is worthwhile uh uh i mean personally i went to college ah i got a free ride on a fine arts scholarship believe it or not breath </s>
mhm </s>
uh only because i did a lot of plays when i was in high school lipsmack i never studied theater had any desire to breath to work professionally in the theater but uh breath it it got college paid for and if ah if male cheerleading is what it takes that is fine </s>
well that i i i would consider that an extracurricular activity though that is not a ah core subject or academically uh </s>
breath </s>
like uh you are not going to uh there is no career in male cheerleading </s>
breath well i will i will agree with you there but it does help the school </s>
afterwards </s>
i mean there there that that the </s>
does it do you think it brings in income </s>
breath ah ah yeah i mean i i think to the </s>
if i was an alumni of a school and they i found out that they were offering full scholarships to male cheerleaders i would definitely have to uh review that </s>
well i mean i it it strikes me that if ah if you are going to uh i am not a big sports fan </s>
 </s>
breath but if you are going to a big football powerhouse school like notre dame or something like that </s>
mhm </s>
um i i got to believe that the half time entertainment and the cheerleading squad and everything is all part and parceled that television package that maybe you do not get those th those types of contracts u unless you offer a something little extra or maybe you get a little bit more money in the contract maybe the contract covers the program i do not know but i think that there is an economic benefit to be had from it </s>
probably so you are probably right there breath um as far as any oth other extracurric curricular i am all </s>
breath </s>
for them ah whatever breath </s>
 </s>
college students can do everything except drink beer and uh laugh you know build eighty foot bonfires i am all for </s>
yeah b yeah well that is a little silly i agree with you there breath no but ah yeah i i think we are on the same page on that one in that uh breath you know they always told me when i went to college that this was the time to broaden your horizons and uh breath experience as much as you can experience and breath uh you know and if that means volleyball or bowling or the fishing club or whatever it happens to be </s>
right </s>
breath i have got no problem with that </s>
what was our what was what was their exact question posed to us i am i was not </s>
breath lipsmack the exact question as i recalled it </s>
okay </s>
breath was uh what do you think about extracur uh do you think a college ought to offer extracurricular activities breath or or you know could that money be spent better elsewhere </s>
oh okay um hm ah when you put it that </s>
and you know i i think i think money </s>
way i it it it kind of changes it for me because what was that did you g hear a beep sound </s>
no i did not hear anything on my end </s>
oh maybe it was my call waiting breath but anyway um </s>
no </s>
when put it that way it is i have to ignore it but when you put it that way i would say that there is some i think you would have to review it on a case by case basis a university by university basis breath </s>
breath yeah </s>
and examine the need of the student body to see uh exactly which e extracurricular activities could probably benefit them the most </s>
well i i think money as a general rule money can always be better spent elsewhere if if you know what i am saying i mean breath </s>
yeah you got a point there </s>
you know someone s someone is going to look at this and say </s>
breath </s>
uh why you wasting money on fine arts scholarships uh you could sp you could put that money into the football program breath and the guy whose </s>
right </s>
kid is going to school on a football scholarship says yeah put the money into the football program and to hell with the fine arts scholarship but my parents were saying no no we like that whole fine arts scholarship thing breath because it is saving us a ton of money lipsmack so you know i think as a general rule you can look at that </s>
well the d well on that in that point i have to disagree there because breath </s>
breath </s>
football scholarships are revenue producing the football it is like the football program subsidized the girls volleyball team </s>
lipsmack breath </s>
at most universities </s>
ah it at the bigger schools i agree </s>
you say like penn state you say like at penn </s>
ah at the bigger s yeah i i agree with you at the bigger schools uh some of these extracurricular activities turn a profit </s>
do they like the chess club </s>
breath well no no th i mean uh no i am agreeing with you </s>
laugh oh okay </s>
like i am i i am sure at the penn state football program makes money for penn state university </s>
right </s>
i do not think the chess club has made money for any school anywhere </s>
unless they are world champions or something you get some kind of a </s>
yeah unless it is the uh you know the bobby fischer chess club </s>
yeah y unless they get some kind of notoriety and then that </s>
absolutely i mean i don't even it's some of their questions are a little dumb </s>
laugh i i know and then </s>
laugh you're the nice </s>
and then i mean just like really thinking on it how much could i do really to avoid a plane crash </s>
like well i i'm sure we i'm sure we could even avoid </s>
you know or a volcano you know </s>
the the aut you know do anything for the automobile i think it's just like a hypothetically if you had that power </s>
oh yeah that's a hypothetical question okay </s>
you know but i think we have to be ho i i know i myself have to be honest that uh i would certainly um </s>
she's a family member </s>
try to save my family member </s>
hm yeah yeah and i mean breath fact it sort of like really stumped me because i mean breath how much more can i say than that because i know i would feel the same way </s>
i know yeah that that's really what i mean that's we have to drag this out for six minutes of course laugh but </s>
i know okay so an and i mean and and and even if it was age-wise as far as what what how old a family member was or whether he was a distant family member </s>
mhm </s>
i still i don't you know </s>
lipsmack i think everything that touches home is more um heart-wrenching than than people you don't know like breath i think it's human nature we have to rely on human nature a lot and even when you breath see these horrid things that happen you know with people dying there's a part of your inner being that says well thank god it wasn't someone i knew or thank god it wasn't you know </s>
you are absolutely right </s>
that's just breath absolutely </s>
that's the first thing you think too you know </s>
you know and the wars all the wars </s>
that's the first thing you think </s>
we're so thankful they're being fought somewhere else and not being fought here </s>
right and the people that were lost in the woods you know </s>
you know breath </s>
when our people come home the people that we loved so much breath </s>
mhm mhm </s>
i feel sorry for the for families whose members did not come back home </s>
right </s>
but i am really thankful that mine were all able to come back home </s>
but you're thankful yours are here exactly and i think that's just the human side of us so perhaps like i said it's not always uh what you should say but if you're going to be honest it's certainly the way you feel </s>
okay and i truly feel that </s>
you know </s>
i know i mean i just now just came from a family reunion </s>
mhm </s>
so i know you know and i just met some new fam mem family members so </s>
right uh-huh uh-huh </s>
i know that even though i just met them i know that they're a part of me </s>
right breath is family important to you </s>
and yes oh extremely extremel tha that's my life you know </s>
yeah yeah everybody breath absolutely it's your lifeline it's who you are </s>
you know i put them above everything you know there's some people who feel </s>
right </s>
that who who who haven't been used to having a family </s>
right </s>
and they may feel different about the question </s>
right i know what you're saying i know what you're saying </s>
but the um i was talking to well someone was just telling me about someone who was depressed yesterday </s>
mhm </s>
and they was saying how they don't really have a family you know they've never been close to anybody in their family </s>
mhm mhm mhm </s>
they're distant with everybody </s>
mm mm </s>
and they don't call them they don't call each other whatnot </s>
that's sad </s>
so maybe breath somebody like that maybe that response may be different you know i don't know because you know everybody's different but </s>

and y and they do not have quite the clarity with the ericsson </s>
as a result of burning the flag </s>
right </s>
then i think there needs to be a punishment but i think that if breath you know there is no um a any incitement of violence and it is just one person doing it it is freedom of speech it is </s>

laugh </s>
and what about you </s>
lipsmack um </s>
same thing laugh </s>
yeah i mean pretty much i do not think you know i you bring up a good point as far as uh you know someone is doing it as like a violent act towards someone else </s>
right </s>
then yeah they should be punished but as far as you know just as expression you know just doing it because you want to do it you know uh i can not say you you should punish someone for that that is for sure </s>
i agree laugh </s>

um they bu </s>
everybody pretty cool </s>
the circumstances that happened reactions and this could happen to you if you decided to um you know commit a crime </s>
yeah do you think ha </s>
they were a advertising on tv breath </s>
do you think they should show the whole trial like like they did for the o j simpson thing </s>
well yeah they really </s>
like they showed every deta </s>
do that out for everybody breath no laugh i mean it is it was unusual i think because of the you know maybe the fact that she was white and he was black </s>
mhm </s>
and that was like a double whammy they wanted to advertise that too you know what i mean </s>
breath well i think the whole reason that </s>
and jealousies </s>
they televised it is only because he was famous not t </s>
and that too yeah him being famous but i think it was like a lot of double standards in that that they got a lot of </s>
i </s>
lot of media coverage out of like so many different stories they could pull from it </s>
sneeze breath </s>
so you you focus on the murder but then you focus on oh he was a </s>
i do not </s>
a good athlete and you focus on well she did drugs breath and you know she was went both ways breath you know they they kind of like gave you their both life stories </s>
right i do not think it should have been televised though like if it was just </s>
yeah </s>
an average person </s>
it would of never been yeah </s>
like me if it was me it ac accused of a murder and i was saying i did not do it or do it </s>
yeah </s>
like like what right does the entire country have to see it and i think just because someone is famous </s>
yeah </s>
o j simpson whoever </s>
yeah yeah </s>
it is kind of like they h have less rights than everybody else </s>
they made us like a field day of it breath </s>
mhm </s>
only because he was famous and stuff and </s>
right </s>
all that which i thought was stupid because like you said he could be you know joe shmoe and oh this guy killed this girl news at eleven you know what i mean </s>
right breath </s>
and then okay he goes to court he is guilty he gets life and then you never hear the rest of it laugh </s>
yeah you never hear anything after that </s>
and you are done breath you never hear anything else out </s>
cough </s>
so that is the case everybody is going to be broke if they try laugh and put every single person that commits a crime in the media </s>
mhm </s>
it is like that is going to cost millions and you know make a lot of lives just miserable because that is all you are ever going to hear laugh </s>
yeah lipsmack i think it is okay for them to </s>
because of </s>
put it on the news you know </s>
yeah </s>
just say this is what is going on in the trial but to put the whole thing on </s>
yeah there is drag it out drag it out bring this person in that person in and </s>
and it is even kind of a waste like the fact that the o j simpson thing was on every channel </s>
oh that is what i mean it is like the president laugh he could not escape it </s>
right did did we need it on every channel i mean everybody gets </s>
i know laugh </s>
nbc cbs abc </s>
breath </s>
do we need to have it on all three breath </s>
exactly and then you know that is that is devastates a lot of people because they may have to have families that and only person that knows about it is the immediate family you know what i mean </s>
mhm </s>
and here this person they are like exploiting it all over the place and you know that brings feelings to people that are like you know just give it a break let let it die breath </s>
yeah breath </s>
let it rest because it is a it is just a lot of heartaches sometimes too bringing memories of people that ha maybe have been in that situation </s>
yeah </s>
for a family member </s>
i do not even think people really care laugh breath </s>
no it is just it is just like soap opera to most people </s>
right </s>
breath oh i have to get the news because show when o j did it and wa where the house was breath what type of furniture breath you know laugh where the bushes were and stuff like that </s>
right every little detail </s>
every little detail they just could not wait to you know what i mean </s>
cough mhm </s>
get a hold of it it is like all my children or something laugh </s>
yup </s>
so i do not know it is bizarre i do not think they should because it is it takes up like you said too much time and too much trouble for the whole thing </s>
yeah i bet i mean i guess the ratings were good for tv and everything but it must have cost them a lot of money </s>
of course </s>
to put </s>
that is what that is probably what they were hoping for too laugh </s>
yeah </s>
like i said everything is like a chain reaction it is like you know they they try to pull so many stories out of it just to keep it rolling just to keep you know </s>
mhm </s>
the the story alive and you know add more juice to it breath to keep people sucked in on it </s>
yeah </s>
and you could not go anywhere without hearing about it </s>
yeah i remember i was at school when they did the o </s>
yeah </s>
the ah o j simpson thing and everybody like skipped their classes </s>
yeah </s>
everyone went back to their dorms and everything </s>
and all that breath </s>
and when the ah decision was announced it ever everybody is like screaming you know </s>
yeah </s>
most people eh did not like the decision but </s>
of course </s>
um it was interesting </s>
yeah and imagine </s>
i mean ho </s>
e every single one of those type scenarios on the news all across the country people commit murders and stuff like that everyday you know what i mean </s>
yeah </s>
well that is all that that is all the tv will be consumed of is </s>
right so what is the point </s>
trials laugh i do not think they should </s>
yeah </s>
i just was kind of talking to myself so it would not be a complete wasted call for them laugh so i was like breath </s>
breath oh i see </s>
yeah so i mean i did not know i did know whether or not to hang up </s>
that is a good idea </s>
breath because i knew it was going to register me as a call but i did not you know i wanted them to get as much information as they needed you know </s>
right </s>
so thank goodness i was in the </s>
do do you usually get </s>
car with someone so i was not completely talking to myself i was just kind of carrying on a conversation with them </s>
laugh breath well that is good </s>
so </s>
breath um so is it usually omnipoint people involved </s>
breath actually yeah um </s>
huh </s>
lipsmack well actually i would probably would say out of the eight calls that i have been on probably six of them have been omni people </s>
oh okay </s>
lipsmack or people that know people from omnipoint yeah </s>
so that is a lot oh somehow i thought we were a small part of the overall thing </s>
breath maybe we are maybe it is just the timing of it i do not know </s>
no i do not think so laugh </s>
lipsmack oh because i was going to say maybe it was </s>
breath i mean that is a pretty high percentage </s>
or are you down are you where do you work out of </s>
cedar knolls </s>
you work out of cedar knolls oh okay </s>
yeah how about you </s>
i am in bethlehem bethlehem </s>
oh okay </s>

breath okay </s>
so </s>
breath so are we supposed to talk about the given topic or no </s>
breath i ah uh what she told me in the beginning is j just to get people to talk so they are not kind of stumbling over everything so </s>
okay okay it is just a place holder </s>
and we could really talk about anything right </s>
breath right okay got you breath and then does it tell us when it has been five minutes or do we just figure it out </s>
no it beeps it will tell you </s>
oh okay </s>
yeah the first time i was like this is your first call </s>
laugh yeah </s>
yeah the first time i was on one of these things i was just like okay uh i guess one of us should start keeping track of the time you know it then it beeps </s>
right </s>
so it was like okay fine </s>
right well that is good at least </s>
so </s>
they do that for you know </s>
right </s>
lipsmack breath i um yeah i re registered um wednesday before thanksgiving i was driving to my family's house and breath and um you know i had sent them the email so they called me back then breath and then they they gave me the pin and everything but i did not um breath and then </s>
get the information </s>
breath they they have they i mean they well they just did not tell me that part about the timing breath but then you know they and they asked me when would be a good time to receive calls but breath as best i can tell they completely ignore that laugh breath because i i think i said </s>
yeah </s>
seven to ten pm weekdays breath or seven to ten pm weekdays and then anytime um saturday and sunday breath and they um they pretty much call when they want to </s>

or is it dry </s>
no it is not dry it is just breath um intense it is too intense you know </s>
is it li it is lots do you deal with a lot of the legals </s>
um yeah you have to just really breath read the fcc rules an incredible amount and in fact the legal people the people in our legal department breath do not even get that involved in it i mean but you have to know those </s>
that is comforting </s>
laugh i know </s>
breath laugh </s>
breath but we had an outside firm who was involved and um </s>
right </s>
but not in the day to day rules because really you just have to read it and know it you know breath they have like a breath a question and answer session for you breath the fcc does so that helps breath but anyway </s>
yeah i guess they would want people to get it correct the right the first time so </s>
lipsmack yeah </s>
cough </s>
exactly they do they do not like laugh they do not like mishaps and i guess there have been mis misinterpretations of the rules in the past and stuff stuff </s>

actually up in allentown as a kid </s>
uh-huh </s>
uh right before the flyers got formed </s>
oh really wow </s>
so i i watched um channel nine new york off the antennae on the house and uh i taught myself hockey it took about two seasons to learn the damn game </s>
yeah it's it's quick really quick moving </s>
yeah and and they're s there were so many different ways of offside back then </s>
really </s>
that uh that was the difficult part trying to figure out what the heck that was </s>
oh really wow </s>
but it was a fun game something so unique to what i grew up in as a kid you know playing that i j i just fell in love with it </s>
oh really well that's neat then </s>
yeah </s>
that's really neat but yeah so </s>
you're obviously a flyer fan or </s>
oh yeah yeah i'm a big flyers fan it's just uh it seems like they always do really well in the season and then somebody gets hurt like lindross or renior and they just fall apart in the playoffs laugh </s>
well i'll tell you what yeah if if if the get the goalie situation down straight by the end of the year there's no dominant team this year </s>

uh they're </s>
i mean they were good last year too but they got knocked off early </s>
well they the th they don't have the action right now and i looked at their their stats on the internet and just i think this morning and there is really not a dominant player on that team right now </s>
uh-huh yeah )) i can't believe they're winning though but i mean that's breath that's that's what you need </s>
yeah but they're they're you know they're they're struggling </s>
yeah yeah </s>
yeah they're stug yeah saint louis looks good right now you got toronto looking okay breath la even with robitaille out with a broken foot still is winning </s>
yeah it's that's unbelievable </s>
so you know if you can lose your top scorer like that an and continue on it says that maybe it might be for real this year </s>
laugh </s>
and of course there's my team at the bottom looking to see if they can set an all-time you know them and chicago f fighting it out for the worst team in the league </s>
oh you got leech out how long is he out for </s>

how's richter doing </s>
i'd hate to who was that richter </s>
how yeah </s>
yeah he's not doing well at all no he's his record is like three and nine </s>
yeah exactly </s>
oh even if you were not i think no matter what i would tell laugh i would have to say something </s>
breath i mean ah you figure you figure it is </s>
otherwi it would ruin my i mean you obviously can not eat it </s>
y well it is probably i mean it is still it is just protein </s>
breath right </s>
so even if it i- even i it is pr- it is just protein </s>
that is true </s>
even if it even if it was just cooked in there you know i mean even if if it was cooked in there it is kind of nasty but e pro eat around it or something i do not i mean it is laugh breath it is the kind of situation </s>
it is not ah it is a pretty bizarre question yeah i do not know um where they uh came up with tha this particular one um i do not even know how you ah expound on laugh something like that like go into any detail on that um the </s>
kind of hard </s>
well i guess they kind of want to know how the service is though i will just ah run a a parallel here i was watching uh the shawshank redemption the other night </s>
no w what show </s>
the shawshank redemption </s>
oh okay yeah </s>
have you seen that movie it is it it is a pretty good movie and they had uh there is a scene there where the and and </s>
yeah </s>
where the the lead tim robbins </s>
uh-huh </s>
actually reaches in and he is eating the the jail the food in at the jail </s>
uh-huh </s>
and there is a ah some kind of little insect in his food </s>
uh-huh </s>
and there's an elderly gentleman that says to him are you going to eat that </s>
uh-huh </s>
and you immediately think well this old guy is go actually going to eat what this ah this insect coming out of the guy's food and he is actually just feeding it to his little pet bird </s>
oh really yeah sure like if the family you know if the family dog was like under the table or something </s>
laugh </s>
you could kind of slip it to him and he would probably eat it yeah i was actually thinking about that myself if i had uh luckily i do not have roaches in my apartment but if i did um i would probably want to get like a cat or a dog or something like that you know it is kind of you would figure you would figure they could like hunt them at night you know laugh </s>
i suppose yeah i guess a a cat more than anything although uh i-i actually ah have had cats before and ah they are m more scared of anything than ah </s>
eh uh say that again </s>
th they do more harm they do more than harm than good </s>
oh really </s>
laugh </s>
you mean in terms of like pests around the house </s>
yeah as as far as um not not really paying any attention to ah it they would play with an insect that i do not think they would ah really do anything else with it </s>
really </s>
i do not know that they would do be that ah breath that much of a help </s>
i see yeah i guess i know my friend my two of my friends have they used to have three cats now they have two and um i think they do like they actually keep the place pretty clean like they they will like eat pests and uh they will actually they will actually catch pests and eat them at night </s>
oh is that right </s>
because they have yeah because they have they live in a place that is ah i do not i do not know what it was in the old apartments that they had they had problems with pests in their place </s>
oh </s>
and uh they were saying that they would do that so </s>
i do not know my gir my girlfriend has a dog and she ah and her her dog just ah i think it is uh it is more afraid of any i mean i have seen ah i have seen it run from from mice so </s>
really </s>
so i guess it all depends on it is a it is a little mu t </s>
how big is it i see okay </s>
yeah so maybe that has something to do with it </s>
you would have to have you would have to have an animal that was really you know sort of trained to hunt you know like a dachshund or something laugh </s>
sure yeah exactly </s>
so they could like hunt them down no </s>
something yeah i i have always had ah and she has a small dog and i years ago i had a sm a small dog myself so </s>
really </s>
never anything that uh really would be i would consider menacing or would ah breath well-trained to as far as uh breath attacking or r r r seeking out little animals or whatever they there you want them to do </s>

and they shouldn't be watching it no they they don't need to see it </s>
i don't really think i think it right i really think it puts a different light on it for them don't you </s>
well they they don't understand what they're watching but they think they do so what they're seeing isn't really what's going on </s>
right and they're </s>
and then they they think it's okay to do these things because well he got away with it </s>
exactly well not only that they're looking at that person as a hero all of a sudden because it's televised </s>
right </s>
my goodness breath you know mtv is televised and all those are their heroes laugh you know whatever is on tv </s>
and they're not good either </s>
exactly and then then they put something like that on and they think all these people are heroes that all these are terrible terrible things they do terrible ah heinous crimes an and they're on tv and they show it blow by blow </s>
no </s>
and discuss it blow by blow and uh even even when they had the trial with clinton that was ridiculous </s>
yeah and </s>
all the information </s>
plus the taxpayers money to have it televised i mean breath we're paying for that </s>
definitely definitely i it </s>
and that's way too much </s>
i agree i it just shows it shows kids the wrong thing it doesn't show them the good things that should change things on television we don't need a we don't need all of that </s>
right it di </s>
sometimes like like when oj was on i it was in the day now if you work how could you watch it but you ended up having is the retired senior citizens were watching it and the young children if they weren't being watched or baby-sat or of they we they weren't being monitored </s>
right </s>
and and that was what what was going on i mean even with the clinton trials my goodness </s>
and they didn't need to see that either </s>
i no i agree i i'd much rather put on some public tv and breath and watch something like that i i didn't myself i didn't watch the oj breath trial </s>
know i didn't either </s>
i thought it was ridiculous i mean </s>
but i mean you saw so much of it like broadca rebroadcast at night no matter what channel you turned on it was on </s>
eh </s>
whether you watched it or not </s>
ex exactly the media really takes over today a little too much i think </s>
that's why they shouldn't be able to </s>
i don't th </s>
publicize stuff like that that should be in a closed courtroom </s>
oh i </s>
that doesn't need to be publicized for all to see especially like you said the young kids that aren't supposed to see these things </s>
exactly exactly we're not totally monitoring these kids and before you know it you're walking put passing through the room with the television on and you see the kids are watching it it's ridiculous absolutely i i agree i i just do not think they should do that not at all </s>
no i don't think so either </s>
huh uh not at all so um the media just gets too too carried away with what's going on i they they they put it on they have it on sixty minutes and they laugh then they put it on twenty-twenty they put it on every single show everytime you turn around somebody's talking about these trials and and it's giving like i said it's giving kids the wrong impression that all of this is great because they're on tv and uh they're being interviewed and they just think that we all accept this and we don't </s>
right </s>
you have little ones i hear in the background </s>
yes </s>
yes you'd uh </s>
two </s>
i don't think you want them to see that i have a four </s>
no </s>
thirteen and a fourteen year old and uh and they were exposed to all that they you know there were times i'd i'd catch them and i'd say oh come on you know get this off it's trash and they did but i could care less what went on in those trials half the time </s>
me too </s>
i mean i um </s>
that's what i feel too </s>
definitely with the murder trial and and uh we just did not need to know all of that and and then like i said when when clinton was on that was r absolutely ridiculous who needed to know verbally what went on or or situations i didn't really want to know in fact i didn't even listen to it </s>
no but y </s>
i didn't even watch it </s>
but like i said you could hardly help it it's all over </s>
it exactly </s>
every news program an </s>
exactly the media just hypes everything up a little too much today i uh eh everybody wan wants to be the top sh sh top show all the time that's all they're doing is showing it over and laugh over and over and over again it's ridiculous so uh so that's i guess that's what we think criminal trials do not </s>
they do not belong televised </s>
definitely not the long televised whoever got the idea to do that i wonder </s>
i think it's just to make to make money </s>
laugh all a sudden it caught on and and i guess they thought well this is what everybody wants but i think you were forced to do it everytime you </s>
i mean if if it was my trials for something i don't think i'd want it all over the television </s>
laugh i don't think i would either or any of them their opinion you know </s>
well considering he got away with it </s>
um </s>
mhm he was probably guilty anyway laugh </s>
laugh i think so too </s>
he might have wanted it on tv who knows </s>
when are you a baseball fan </s>
no laugh i'm not even breath </s>
oh breath </s>
i always get the sports stuff everytime </s>
laugh because last year uh when mark mcgwire and sammy sosa were having their um home run battle </s>
uh-huh </s>
i don't know whether you remember that or not </s>
i do remember that i </s>
they was it w breath it was a pretty big story </s>
yeah </s>
and it was kind of controversial because of the um performance enhancing drugs that uh mcgwire was taking </s>
right oh yeah okay </s>
and they were legal </s>
see i mean if it's something that is prescribed i would i would guess if it was prescribed to them and it was a legal drug or something like that or something to enhance their performance i guess so but i'm talking like harmful street drugs is probably what i'm thinking that's probably </s>
yeah </s>
that's how i took the whole thing laugh </s>
yeah yeah </s>
well of course because this that's just that's what we're doing in the ni you know what i mean that's just it's just </s>
yeah </s>
atmosphere because you don't want someone like dennis rodman </s>
laugh breath i don't i don't think basketball players could stand the test i real laugh </s>
we all know he's smoking something laugh i think he's smoking something laugh and uh um i'm like so he you know i wouldn't really want to be breath i i in the room with him when he starts snapping out so i mean for someone else like </s>
mhm </s>
you know someone like um what's the guy's name i don't know someone who's not </s>
and whi which sport </s>
i know i was just thinking football </s>
ah </s>
trying to compare football and basketball but you know dion sanders </s>
ah huh </s>
like he's a nice church-going guy </s>
ah huh </s>
he gets in a room with dennis and dennis snaps out smacks him around </s>
laugh yeah </s>
that's not going to be cool laugh so </s>
the other part of the question is should all sports be tested and i know there are some sports where you really e even if you just limited the test to illegal drugs you'd lose an awful lot of participants </s>
yeah that's true too i mean it but then it will come down to a um priority type thing with that </s>
breath </s>
you know what i mean if if you got fired from like if i got fired from my job because i chose drugs over my job then that's an issue some issues i have some bigger issues i have going on </s>
that's true tha that's true an and really it comes down to a moral question i mean for professional athletics a lot of people regard them as paid mercenaries anyway and if they choose to abuse their bodies in order to enhance their performance so be it um </s>
right that's true too </s>
you know but um the morality of it you know the kind of example that um those people who are highly visible set for others you know is a serious question </s>
mhm right and then a lot of times like being on staying on that subject is like my i have boys and they look up to these people you know what i mean so </s>
right right </s>
but i don't want them to be honoring someone and then we watch the news and it's this big thing this person's busted for drugs you know what i mean </s>
that's right that's right </s>
and so that it comes down a lot of times to that for me that's important i if kids are looking up to you then you need to be doing the right thing </s>
so i i i guess we're basically in agreement that uh they should be tested at least for illegal drugs and um </s>
yeah i mean but like i said i if it's something that is not illegal and and i mean i i don't i really don't know i mean how does that work if like steroids are they illegal </s>
wh um no </s>
but </s>
they are not </s>
i see </s>
breath but they're dangerous </s>
right </s>
so they're available by uh prescription or you should uh you know regulate your use under a phy under a physician's care but they're not illegal </s>
and normally there's a coa would the coach know that like say a athlete was uh using steroids would the coach necessarily know or no it could be something they're doing real sneaky </s>
th the coach would generally be the person dispensing them laugh breath yeah </s>
ah okay i was g that's what i was thinking but the coached think about it because it bec it could become an insurance issue </s>
breath </s>
if this person passes out on the field you know and dies or something </s>
mhm mhm </s>
then that's an insurance issue so i mean i don't think that's too safe either </s>
yeah but a lot of coaches uh you know to enhance their careers </s>
mhm they'll they don't care about someone else's life laugh </s>
they don't really care absolutely not you know so hey professional athletics what a game breath </s>
laugh yeah righ i i sh i should go be a football player they get money </s>
laugh </s>
they that's where all the big bucks is you know i could go i could go swing a bat shoot run the base to base laugh i'm telling you </s>
laugh do you enjoy do you enjoy playing sports </s>
um i don't um laugh no but i mean </s>

okay </s>
so they could not grow too much of it but he said tha everybody had a little bit of tobacco </s>
wow </s>
you know once again it all boils down to money </s>
oh yeah i am sure like with the oil industry with any industry you know that has hello </s>

breath </s>
just ran into someone from school and breath they had said that the one of their kids was in ah one of the day cares and near the high school they had an incident where there were a whole bunch of police storming the school and she found out through a friend of a friend of a friend that um someone had actually uh smuggled in a very large quantity of drugs laugh breath </s>
breath right yeah </s>
and they ah i guess there was some sort of drug ring going on within the school it is very scary i people used to say oh well breath you know parochial schools private schools those are where breath my child is going to be educated because then it will not run into the same problems but i mean i went to college with um some breath people that graduated from from those types of of schools and i really did not see that much of a difference they had capabilities of doing the same things that the public schools did </s>
yeah oh for sure i mean i thought i was just as capable as the people at parochial schools as far as knowledge goes breath although i got to admit that </s>
mhm </s>
breath my friends who went to parochial school they were definitely breath lipsmack taught a little bit better than i was they were forced to do certain things that i kind of slacked by on </s>
laugh </s>

alright did you you went to public school </s>
laugh breath yes i did breath </s>
up in the allentown area </s>

uh-huh </s>
but it is just it is it scares me to know we have got a class reunion coming up not too too far away and it scares me to know that the facility i graduated from breath has to implement such such machinery to to monitor the ins and the outs of what goes in there i mean when i went to school it was i am going to say it was different i mean every now and then yeah you heard that someone ah bringing a knife to school but now it is just so to the point where they are actually having security people breath at some of the the avenues eh that the that the kids expel from and that really that is a grave concern because i thought it was a safe school and i mean i realize that they are making it safe by implementing those things but ah by the same token it just it scares me to what things have become in the area </s>
i remember being in eighth grade and the you know the bad kid on the bus in the back of the bus showed me a gun breath and i had just like burned an impression in my life forever you know and here was the kid whose probably in tenth grade or whatever it was </s>

yeah i i do not know what kind of responsibility you can put on the school to do more breath i mean you know metal detectors are something that they are kind of forced to have to have </s>
right right but yet i mean how much further can you possibly go with that okay so you were able to you know hide one thing in one way you know do they have to put security systems on the actual doors of the classroom as well i mean we had instances of some i think my senior year in high school breath there was a rape of one of the teachers at another school from another district breath </s>
huh </s>
and i remember being so completely mortified that where how could that possibly happen because of the fact that there was always someone within the school you know always teachers holding um seminars or extra extracurricular activities to have that happen there was ah building but breath i mean i just it really scares me </s>
oh absolutely </s>
it may be the reason i have not really had children may not have been through any fault of my own maybe that is some sort of a blessing on the other other end breath </s>
laugh breath well you do not sound that old i do not know like you are you are past your prime when having children </s>

that for just the american flag or um international flags does it go for </s>
well you can not be biased i mean if you going to ban it for the american flag you got to </s>
exactly </s>

exactly </s>
and then all of a sudden you are ju you know you are infringing on somebody's freedom of speech </s>
exac exactly exactly </s>
yeah </s>
exactly i i agree with that </s>
hm tell that to a veteran though that lost his best friend defending the flag though </s>
oh my yeah </s>

yeah yeah i see </s>
and here is the guy who was out there in the jungle knee deep in rice patties </s>
yeah </s>
you know having his best friend shot over a flag </s>
yeah </s>
and then you you some punk is going to go and and burn it in front of him you know that that is a he he may have a different opinion </s>
yeah i do not think i would even want to have that discussion with with a veteran </s>
laugh </s>
laugh i think that would be rather dangerous </s>
exactly laugh </s>
you might find yourself in a in a war right there breath </s>
breath and uh </s>
but yeah i w i do not think i would </s>
lipsmack so </s>
say anything to anyone because like you said that is </s>

right </s>

right </s>
crashed i mean i will watch like a half an hour report just to get all the information about it breath but i i generally do not watch television to get </s>

laugh </s>
breath that whatever is going on just does not affect me except for you know a very small percentage of of of things that are happening </s>
i guess then i guess that is one of the reasons reading the newspaper a lot of times i do not read the main section </s>

breath we have to talk for six minutes and that is why i asked you to like sort of press to press one so that they start recording and </s>
oh okay </s>
um breath as far as i understand they really want like they do not really want us to talk about the topic they just choose a topic at random to sort of keep us entertained so that we do not just </s>
oh okay just diddle around like ah what do we talk about kind of thing okay breath so </s>
breath uh but other otherwise so we can talk about what ever breath </s>
is ah are you a student there or </s>
yeah oh laugh </s>
oh okay </s>
breath i am a student here so breath although this is one of the better </s>

topics one of the previous ones topics included something like what do you think about unions </s>
unions </s>

oh oh okay </s>
because i had nothing to say and i was never a member of a union i have no idea </s>
laugh breath why you know and you are like uh i do not know anything about the subject so laugh let us talk about something different </s>

yeah so are they making it available to just us and students or is it </s>
i as far as i understand anybody who owns a gsm handset can sign up </s>
oh really </s>
i think they just promoted it sort of breath well they just targeted like they they chose people where th but they chose to target to promote because they know that gsm i mean the omnipoint employees have gsm handsets breath and they </s>
right </s>
then they want somebody with a gsm handset only it goes so </s>
oh okay </s>
that pretty much narrowed it down to omnipoint customers and omnipoint employees </s>
right that is true because there is not a lot of gsm available </s>
yeah </s>
maybe they are thinking uh international scope or something i do not know </s>
breath i have no idea i do not even know what they are going to use this for i sincerely hope they just digitize it instead of just hide away breath </s>
right </s>
breath its not sneeze </s>
laugh </s>
breath oh i mean oh </s>
it is good data i guess i do not know </s>
breath </s>
i do not know what they will use it for </s>
as far as i understand they just sort of they digitize it they just break it up into chunks digitize it and sort of put it away and then process the information they never actually look at the actual conversation breath </s>
oh okay </s>
that is why the topic is not really relevant as long as it is more or less comprehensible english they do not care what what they talk about </s>
oh so are they are they working on voice recognition i guess </s>
i i have no idea they they did not really tell </s>
hm </s>
um i i i asked them but they they told me that th ah they hm p wor working about improving of the um about improving of the capacity for voice scanning something like that </s>
oh okay yes </s>
they they want they want the sound to be more clear but </s>
oh great </s>
i do not really know </s>
huh that is a good way to do it i guess </s>
i suppose </s>
laugh oh boy so what are you going to do when you are out of uh out of your studies </s>

has analogue roaming yeah </s>
yeah and i was hoping that they were going to introduce it for omnipoint but i guess they did not want </s>
well once uh voicestream comes in then they will have it laugh </s>
breath but they already merged with voicestream so breath </s>
what is that </s>
but did not omnipoint already merge with voicestream like over the summer </s>
not uh no not yet that has not happened yet no </s>
not yet hm i see </s>
soon laugh </s>
so does this mean they going to rename the company </s>
if they were to go to college now i would not be able to afford it they would need to go on scholarships if they can get them </s>
yeah </s>
because they'll be no way that i can send them </s>
yeah um </s>
because uh we live pretty much paycheck to paycheck and laugh there's no time to save laugh breath </s>
i i i think everyone does laugh i think everyone lives paycheck to paycheck </s>
uh and that's sad but </s>
i i'm going to i'm going to guess you're you're omnipoint and you work in customer care </s>
no laugh breath i work for a newspaper </s>
oh i'm shocked oh i i i am i am shocked and amazed </s>
hm oh yeah </s>
you're the first person well the second person i have talked to who hadn't worked for omnipoint directly breath </s>
there you go laugh </s>
um i believe college education is important to certain people uh i have not been college edu educated so uh as far as the price goes i think it's very costly and i i agree with your statement i i live pretty much paycheck to paycheck also </s>
right </s>
um i think my son's plan he's eleven years old now so this is probably going to change but my i think my son's plan is to go into one of the military services and get breath get paid for education in that way </s>
well i guess that's the way to go </s>
ah i s i did eight years in the army but i didn't get college education out of it i got a um one of my student loans was paid for by the army </s>
well d is that what they offered at that time or </s>
um yeah well they had a i had a choice i could either enroll for the college tuition program which sets aside part of your pay to go towards it </s>
oh okay </s>
or they would pay off the any any outstanding student loans that you had and for and for me it actually worked out better that way because i had i had previously gone to uh uh electronic school </s>
okay </s>
before i went into the service so they paid off that for me um i i would i would say that the government probably should help finance some college education because basically there's going to come the time in our lives when you can't get a job without a college education </s>
breath yeah </s>
just just like pretty much with us it was high school education but </s>
that's right everything is changing </s>
it it's getting so it it's so technical now you have to have a higher education just to get the kind of employment you want </s>
breath that's true breath but you know on the other half they're probably only going to pay one percent and it's probably only going to be for your um community colleges not for the colleges that so called are so good harvard and </s>
yeah </s>
you know kids will never get in there if they're not really really smart </s>
yeah the the other concern i have as far as as the government paying for it is uh is that gonna boost our taxes well of course it will laugh </s>
of course laugh breath </s>
so </s>
eh </s>
am i paying for it one way or the other way you know </s>
we're paying for it either way </s>
it's pretty much a it's pretty much a give and take so </s>
right breath but it's more than a car going to college </s>
yes </s>
and it's not guaranteeing them a job </s>
no uh uh you know i've i've heard of many people with uh have gone through the four years and got their degree and are still flipping burgers at mcdonald's you know it just </s>
yeah just to make ends meet </s>
it it just doesn't make sense to me </s>
isn't that it's so sad but that's just the way we are laugh </s>
yeah </s>
you know i know growing up i we didn't think about college it was just not one of those things it was just the thing just to get out of school laugh just finish high school and that's it </s>
yeah laugh exactly my my </s>
it's all laugh </s>
my older sister was the first one in my family to graduate highschool </s>
oh boy </s>
so laugh </s>
so i i mean it's priorities have changed so much </s>
yeah </s>
everything has changed </s>
yeah there's definitely an emphasis on education but you know as far as how you make the ends meet i </s>
laugh breath i don't think we'll ever will but </s>
i haven't got a i haven't got a plan for that like i said my son </s>
you try laugh </s>
my son's e my son's eleven so ho hopefully he keeps up with the idea he's going into a service </s>
laugh breath you breath </s>
and have them pay for his education </s>
you just give him a dollar everytime he thinks of that laugh </s>
hey that works </s>
laugh it it ha it's gonna have to breath i guess that's the only way that the government will that i feel they should chip in if the if they serve the country because a lot of kids aren't gonna serve their country </s>
yeah oh no i </s>
you know you can see it now that they don't have the enthusiastic as we do </s>
yeah they </s>
you know it it's all it </s>
they're having a hard time getting kids to go in with all the uh benefits they do get </s>
right right </s>
so hey i have to admit i got out because the benefits were going downhill fast so </s>
really well they got </s>
i i i figured i needed to get a pension going before uh i got to the age where i didn't have anything to fall onto </s>
yeah but now it it's so g great for them to do join </s>
you know </s>
