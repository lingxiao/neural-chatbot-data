do you think they accomplish anything </s>
i think there comes a lot for as far as the employee is concerned because um there's a lot of jobs around today in today's society that um they're not uh what you would call equal opportunity and a lot of times you don't have a standing chance against management unless you have some type of um backing with you um in certain instances like um where you have um discrimination to employees as far as raises are concerned or as far as um employment opportunities and getting better positions in certain establishments </s>
well i live in philadelphia and i'm i'm thinking about the septa the transit workers </s>
mhm </s>
they have a very strong union now i work for the federal government </s>
okay </s>
and um we can't you know we can not strike we're represented um whether we belong to the union or not </s>
mhm </s>
um the union isn't it is very powerful nationwide it is very powerful </s>
mhm </s>
and i did support it when i was able to um i had to come out of it because i went into a position then i was i breath uh i went into you weren't allowed to be um you could you could be a union member but you just couldn't have dues deducted from your paycheck </s>
oh i see </s>
and i elected not to i elected not to to join </s>
i see </s>
i think unions have their place um like i said the transit worker the hospital workers um right now there's um i think it's haverf havertown i think the teachers there are on strike </s>
mhm </s>
i think it's ridiculous that they've been that they worked the whole year without a contract </s>
mhm </s>
and um i do think that unions certain unions do um do make a difference </s>
yes they do i do too well i now reside in philadelphia myself i moved from atlantic city and um we don't have a union at my job because i'm working through a security company called spectaguard </s>
oh okay </s>
and um lipsmack i do knows they um they belong to the police and federal credit union but it's not the same thing as what you would call a union </s>
mhm </s>
but um i am employed through the university of pennsylvania police campus </s>
mhm </s>
and um my employment is okay and um breath the wages are very fair here </s>
okay </s>
you know for a opening door walk through um job opportunity because anytime you can walk through a door make ten dollars an hour laugh </s>
oh that's that's very good </s>
i i don't i don't see any well yes it is very good you know </s>
mhm that's really good i know a friend of mine also he worked at the post office and i worked at the post office a long time ago and it was very powerful </s>
mhm y so did i </s>
oh you did laugh okay laugh </s>
mhm yes i did </s>
breath and </s>
as a matter of fact i worked at the dc office north capital street </s>
oh okay </s>
yeah </s>
and when remember when well y i don't know how old you are but i'm telling my age when the post off when the postal workers when they went on strike </s>
laugh </s>
and then they're still considered federal workers but you know th you know they're really not they have a different contract and you know they're just different now because um after they went on strike </s>
mhm </s>
that was like a no no federal workers couldn't strike </s>
mhm </s>
and um well anyway this fr um this friend of mine her son she he got into some troubles so i said well where was your union because when i worked at the post office the unions was very powerful </s>
yes it was </s>
oh the union want me to do this and the union doesn't seem like they're as powerful as they used to be </s>
okay i was th </s>
at least at least the postal union </s>
w right because i was with the postal union back in the late seventies </s>
okay </s>
and uh they were very powerful back then </s>
but you remember when th the postal workers went on strike </s>
most definitely yeah i remember when uh most of the postal workers breath </s>
oh okay </s>
um were under investigation for the big drug bust that went on in the main post office </s>
mhm </s>
back in the early eighties </s>
mhm </s>
you know when a lot of supervisors lost their jobs and the union really went to bat for them </s>
mhm </s>
you know but um because there was a lot of people that were indicted that were not actually involved </s>
mhm </s>
you know </s>
but i i guess it depends on the union because i'm also thinking about um lipsmack the um city workers </s>
mhm </s>
um a few years ago we had a strike where they didn't pick up the trash </s>
mhm </s>
and i mean we really had to take our our trash to a dumpster </s>
hm </s>
they got every they wanted what they they got what they wanted they did get what they wanted they were out oh i don't know how long </s>
mhm mhm </s>
but i mean the trash piled up in the streets and we took our we had to take our tr uh our um trash to a dumpster </s>
mhm </s>
people regardless of where you live in certain parts of the city they got sick of it wanted the mayor to give them whatever they wanted because it w it was it was unhealthy first of all </s>
i see </s>
it was unhealthy and um who you know people who didn't want trash sitting outside their house so i think it depends really on the union the union leaders </s>
mhm </s>
what they actually stand for </s>
you're right </s>
and is there's unity in numbers and like you say </s>
mhm </s>
um you get into the the you know the uh black issue too </s>
mhm </s>
in a lot of the um i don't know i i you know i'm away from the union part of it somewhat </s>
hm </s>
um right now but i'm just thinking about the things that i've read in the paper about unions and the effect they you know the p the effects they've had on me </s>
prison time like how long </s>
uh-huh um well it it is really m i mean i guess it depends on the crime mis i mean what what happens to the other person they hit um breath very um </s>
t </s>
i am sorry </s>
oh it is okay so do you think they should be punished um regardless if someone dies they should be punished just if they were drinking while um driving period </s>
absolutely </s>
yeah i think um i think that is a good idea i think if people realized that these laws are unbendable they can not get away with it then perhaps it will cut down on it breath so </s>
i i agree i mean i i mean i go out i work in center city and i go out here all the time and i always see people they will have a couple drinks at a bar oh i am fine to drive i am fine to drive well how fine are you when that person runs in front of the street you know runs in front of your car how quick are your reflexes </s>
right that is true </s>
you know n y you do not know how fine you are y you know and i just think it it is a huge problem </s>
that is true i mean breath i know that um in some states like in louisiana um i think their i want to say their roads are funded partially by the state who i think they went back and forth on their drinking age </s>
right </s>
and i believe they have pretty strict laws on um drinking and driving i do not know what it is like in pennsylvania i have not been here very long but i do not know how strict they are at all </s>
um i am not really sure either but i know um for example down down at the shore the jersey shore </s>
mhm </s>
breath i have heard of situations where cops will watch people leave a bar and see them get into the car </s>
hm </s>
and then and like they will be stumbling out of a bar and before they can even start the car they will breath you know um r be required to take a sobriety test and i i mean i i think it is a great deterrent </s>
oh </s>
but i also think it might be a little too involved to have you know cops at every bar watching people leave </s>
right </s>
then seeing if they are going to get into a car um you know i think that is a huge th it it is a deterrent but it is also maybe uh too much to do </s>
yeah the i have never heard of that but it is certainly a good idea i guess in theory but in actuality i guess they do not have enough police officers to stay and watch </s>
right yeah i i think it is definitely too much to ask but breath i think right now you you have to pay a fine </s>
oh </s>
um i think it is just a pretty big fine but i do not think that is </s>
but no no jail time is required i am sorry </s>
i do not think so i do not think so um breath </s>
hm </s>
you know so if someone has money what is a fine what what does that mean it is nothing it does not teach someone anything </s>
yeah breath yeah i guess so i mean breath that's true maybe there is a way they could they could work in like some some jail time and a partial fine as well </s>
right i mean it is </s>
because </s>
right </s>
so breath yeah i did not know actually that it was just a fine that they paid </s>
i i think or it might be depending on how many times you've done it </s>
oh my god laugh breath </s>
um breath i i am really i am not that sure like i said i do not do criminal law but i am not um i am really not sure </s>
right </s>
but i think any jail time what and i am not saying lock the person up for but i think that um </s>
right at least for a couple months laugh breath </s>
yeah or breath or even like a couple weeks just to you know as a deterrent </s>
yeah </s>
uh i mean i know i would think if i was locked up for a couple weeks for drunk driving breath i would think very long and hard before drinking and getting into a car </s>
definitely </s>
um </s>
wow that is that is actually a good idea </s>
yeah </s>
so you do not have any um y you did not ever want to go into criminal law or </s>
no mhm because i i c i could never defend </s>
no </s>
i have a very hard time defending someone who let us say was drunk and driving and killed someone </s>
yeah </s>
you know how how could you defend someone like that and that is breath um uh uh not for me laugh breath </s>
yeah i understand </s>
not for me at all </s>
i think it would be difficult as well but </s>
yeah so breath </s>
hopefully there is that what if they have ah mothers against drunk driving right they are the ones who do </s>
right </s>
do that breath </s>
right </s>
i do not know if that is i guess it is is it nationwide i can not remember if it is because i am from texas i am um i am down south so </s>
oh okay </s>
i they are really big down there but i do not know much about pennsylvania </s>
yeah um th they are nation wide </s>
or nationwide </s>
um you know they are definitely i i have heard of them here er i don't know how big their chapter is but i know that they breath definitely are um in pennsylvania </s>
oh that is good </s>
yeah so </s>
it is good that they at least have programs breath to to maybe strengthen some of these laws </s>
yeah i think it there also needs to be more liability put on um owners of bars </s>
yeah breath </s>
you know </s>
i agree too i think that um i know in texas a lot of um bar and restaurant owners get away with serving minors um but i guess there are not too many rules to make guidelines for people who are of age of age you know for them to watch but breath </s>
right that is true </s>
hm breath goodness i am like well i am a student laugh breath </s>
yeah it </s>
i am not any um my boyfriend actually wants to go into law so that is not um it is a good field have you been in it for awhile </s>

oh okay </s>
i am yeah </s>

breath um </s>
laugh </s>
i do not know i think it is important </s>
yeah i </s>
but i think like music programs are important too </s>
i did too and i guess </s>
but also when i was in like elementary school and stuff i never i think it is important to like have good academic programs too because i never saw the point of like all that like </s>
right </s>
library and like like library class is dumb i do not know i guess it teaches kids about like books and stuff </s>
right well i guess i mean i mean ultimately now with computers you are not going to need library resources like you do but you will probably need that for computer resources but </s>
right </s>
the library itself was never people were not using it much but you obviously need the breath the material that is in there laugh </s>
right breath </s>
breath um in terms of uh um i was never heavily into into breath those programs so i i cannot tell you um </s>
mhm </s>
i i think probably what happens is that the first thing that ends up giving is things like that art art and music when they only have so much money to to spend and they will put it in academic programs first i would assume </s>
right </s>
and not and probably breath uh athletic which is sad to say they are probably putting more money into athletics than they are to </s>
yeah mhm </s>
to things like art and um but i do not know </s>
i do not know like i think it is important but maybe not </s>
are you </s>
though i do not know </s>
right i mean you do not want to say it is not as important because you certainly do not want to belittle the value of </s>
right it is important because </s>
of art and </s>
i do not know it is interesting like for kids breath i always saw it as like a break </s>
right </s>
from like my normal subjects </s>
right i do too </s>
um </s>
i do too well i think it is eh eh depending on what what grade level you are talking about you are you are talking about now developing different sides of the brain in terms of your creativity versus you know </s>
right right </s>
the left side and the right side of the brain and stuff like that </s>
mhm </s>
breath i do not know oh so just in in what laugh what are we supposed to do just talk about this for five minutes and then what they cut us off </s>

right </s>
probably what ends up happening year and year and y year after year and that ends up being one of the last things that gets gets the funding </s>
mhm </s>
which is sad but </s>
well i guess it is kind of the least important if it has to come down to it i do not know </s>
yeah and that is and that is a matter of opinion that is correct i think you know </s>
well see </s>
but that is a million dollars </s>
millions dollars is is a lot of money but then on the other hand it is not that much if it has to last you for the rest of your life you have to i mean if you leave with just a million dollars it is not that much </s>
yeah depending upon where you go to </s>
well see on the other hand i could uh i am from norway so i could just move back home laugh </s>
ah understood </s>
it would it would be very simple that </s>
ah not bad not bad </s>
but i i think a lot of people would uh depending where you are in the in the uh i i guess depending on where in society uh i think a lot of people would accept the offer </s>
yeah yeah i mean a lot a lot of people would be in to it me myself i do not know i do not know just because breath i have never been at out of the i i have been up to canada that is about it so </s>
i uh </s>

yeah breath that is </s>
i mean i will i am from norway and my wife is american and all that stuff so i can relate to just picking up and leaving </s>
yeah </s>
it is a little different scenario here that i can go back and whenever i want </s>
mhm </s>
but uh i i think it said that you can never return i guess you become some illegal alien or something most wanted person </s>
yeah that is that is that is a little that is a little rough laugh breath </s>
laugh </s>
but i i do not know a million dollars </s>
so </s>
the eh dependent as i said dependent upon where you go though you know you can you can use the money certain places that would be you could you could turn that into like almost five million yeah laugh </s>
yeah really i like maybe some poor place to mexico or uh something like that and just hang out </s>
yeah you buy buy a house for next to nothing and you know do what you got to do breath laugh </s>
you could buy yourself like an island or something somewhere i do not know if you could that for a million but just live there and </s>

uh i am testing it for voicestream actually and um eh it we record in in in network area if you are in the voicestream network they will uh let us say i i uh see the f phone tends to freeze up and stuff there are some software bugs in it </s>
yeah </s>
so i have to call in right away and report it if i am in their systems </s>
lipsmack </s>
so that they can follow do a trace phone and find found out find out what happened </s>

i guess it is kind of similar to that </s>
uh that is not bad yeah i basically have access to the hlr and this and that and </s>
yeah </s>
breath you know provision people the way they have to be provisioned fun stuff laugh breath </s>

yeah yeah true i mean some of the phones we had the uh data people come in and show us some of the phones and this and that and show us some of the technology that may be coming in i kind of like that new uh nokia </s>
yeah </s>
that that the what is it the seventy one hundred series or what ever it is or </s>
oh breath </s>
yeah even at omnipoint </s>
do you do you breath huh </s>
breath i said at omnipoint i do not see based on your skills it is based on who you know </s>

it does not matter if you can help the customer as long as you are on time </s>
mhm </s>
laugh </s>
as long as you are in adherence </s>

mhm except that you cannot get anything accomplished </s>
breath </s>
every time its every time it pops up you are like still in the middle of writing the notes of the last account </s>
mhm mhm or if somebody else is calling breath if somebody is calling from somebody else's phone there account is going to pop up and they are not even talking about that account </s>
mhm mhm </s>
so it saves time on some calls but it makes time on other calls and </s>
yeah i it is definitely not it has not been advantageous but that is the way that it goes </s>
where do they come up with these ideas anyway i do not know </s>
i do not know it is probably all voicestream </s>
maybe if there if there was more affirmative action then they would laugh smarter people making decisions </s>
b yeah no it is true </s>
laugh then we would come up with this stupid shit laugh breath </s>
if it was affirmative action the company would at least have some people who knew what the hell they were talking about </s>
laugh maybe breath cough but that might be hopeful thinking might be wishful thinking </s>
rather than who you have sucked up to last week </s>
laugh breath that is my problem i want to make things better and i so i complained about stuff like this should be different that is wrong and everything but they don't want to hear that when they want to hear oh this is great and that is great and this new breath </s>

oh really </s>
hello i am sorry leah </s>

alright what was the topic again </s>
uh something about prisoners getting uh activities in jail and should our taxpayers uh should our tax money go towards that </s>
oh should it go towards it </s>
yeah </s>
what do you think </s>
uh i think it is a good program uh-huh because actually in a few years they will be out and they should uh have a life in prison that is breath similar to what we would like them to do after they get out of prison you know should not just be locked up </s>
yeah i feel i f i feel like they should do some things with it i guess it would just depend on what things that they were doing </s>
mhm </s>
you know like uh </s>
not just making license plates right </s>
nah you know oh this is like referring to just them taking up skills </s>
breath that is wha that is the impression i got um having class i know one of my teachers um taught a class in prison breath so i think it is a good it gives them a good advantage when they get out so they can get a better job </s>
definite cause i guess you can not just keep a person caged up all the time and do not let them take up any skills </s>
yeah </s>
yeah think it is a good idea so where do you live at </s>

i love it breath i am sad that they are uh moving </s>
lipsmack </s>
so </s>
bridgewater that is it is a long ride for you right </s>
yeah it is about two hours i think </s>
it is not worth it huh </s>
no it is too expensi you know it is too expensive that area breath the only good thing is that if if you didn't like your job once you get there they are moving in an area where a lot of other pharmaceutical companies are </s>
yeah </s>
so you just go to another one breath but </s>
so um how many um how many sessions have you had </s>
this is my fourth </s>

oh </s>
and they just cut the first well for me my first check they said i should get it by friday </s>
oh yeah </s>
so that was pretty good </s>
that is good so how long ago was your first uh your first session </s>
hm last week </s>
oh yeah i think it is a good idea to have like the universities also with admissions </s>
mhm </s>
um because a lot of people do not pay enough attention to it </s>
huh </s>
it needs to be fair </s>
mhm </s>
in choosing people and i mean if it is going to y you know college is like you know before the workplace anyway so you know i just think it is important </s>
right right any other areas that you know we could use it utilize it in </s>
ah let us see no i it like when they look at the admissions they you know they say that you know they do not they do not look at the type of person but you know they really do laugh </s>
absolutely </s>
i am sure they do laugh </s>
mhm </s>
so i think it has a good affect </s>
yeah </s>
so i think they should follow through with it </s>
mhm and i guess they are m more but </s>
yeah it is still they ah breath </s>
not enough not enough yet </s>
have not seen any you know actual percentages or anything like that </s>
mhm </s>
to show it but you know just you know seeing at some colleges you know </s>
right </s>
it is it is a problem breath </s>
it is a problem but i guess that helps to make it better </s>
yeah um i am sure they will do something in the future about it probably push it more </s>
you think so </s>
yeah because i do not know they they are pushing it more in the workforce now </s>
mhm </s>
you know y you know the equality thing and you know women are getting you know more higher roles </s>
that is true yes mhm </s>
that sort of thing so breath i think they will probably push it you know pretty much everywhere </s>
well that would be good breath </s>
yeah it would be good thing laugh </s>
mhm breath um </s>
 </s>
i wonder how they are doing it in schools if it is </s>
uh do you mean like right like colleges or just regular </s>
well on the high school level </s>
high school level y </s>
to see if that if that um helps to get kids motivated to excel </s>
i know that when i was in high school they did mention you know about </s>
hm </s>
a lot of times they said in the honors programs </s>
mhm mhm </s>
you know there were not there were not enough minorities or </s>
lipsmack right </s>
anything like that but i do not you know i think they try to educate it but they do not </s>
oh okay </s>
they do not push it enough </s>
mhm </s>
and they were just they were just trying to show that you know it really is </s>
that they are with the program ha laugh </s>
right yeah but i guess that is what they were just trying you know trying trying to get everybody to realize </s>
right </s>
you know anybody can </s>
hm </s>
you know be in any program they want </s>
wow that is </s>
just have to do it laugh </s>
laugh right well hopefully it will be nationwide soon and </s>
lipsmack i am pretty sure it will be </s>
it will not be a problem mhm </s>
yeah i just i see it um they have not you know breath they like in college classes now they are stressing that </s>
are they really </s>
you know breath yeah like i had a </s>
hm </s>
i have actually like a human resource administration class </s>
oh you are in college now </s>
and mhm </s>
oh okay good </s>
yeah i go i go to temple </s>
do you really </s>
mhm but um </s>
that is quite a ride is not it </s>
yeah laugh that is a long time </s>
mhm how long does it take you </s>
an hour </s>
does it mhm </s>
yeah but they there is like a whole chapter just stressing </s>
hm </s>
you know affirmative action </s>
oh really oh that is good </s>
mhm so they are really like pu you know saying anybody can do anything they want </s>
uh-huh </s>
and if you see something unfair you know they they push to tell somebody about it </s>
well that is great </s>
mhm </s>
i have not been in the educational field for a while and i had not noticed what was going on so that is good to hear </s>
lipsmack yeah that is so </s>
that is great to hear </s>
but i do i do not know what else they can do i mean you can only laugh you can only say it so many times </s>
right breath i do not know if there is any </s>
but </s>
laws or anything that is pushing it in that direction that would make companies have to comply </s>
i do remember they do have you know some guidelines they do not follow them yeah they can get reported for that yeah if you see something going on </s>
lipsmack i wonder if there is any penalty </s>
i sh i do not remember </s>
mhm </s>
i know that there is you know you get warned and that sort of thing um </s>
okay </s>
but really i mean there is not too much else they can do breath </s>
mhm </s>
probably push it everywhere and not just one specific like just the workforce </s>
right breath breath well that would be the best way i suppose to handle it </s>
yeah </s>
what did you say your name was again i am sorry </s>
marie </s>
marie </s>
mhm </s>
i sh i should remember that it is my daughter's name </s>
it depends on their criteria and what their needs are at that time you know i do not feel as though if they need books and this and that then education i mean art supplies come on give me a break laugh </s>
breath i was thinking the same thing i mean it is nice to let let the kids have breath let them do their thing with art but eh breath they have got put the money towards the important part of their education if they want to be artists that is going to come them probably naturally anyway </s>
right that that is right later on down the line let them get their educations first you know they can worry about drawing and doing this and that later </s>
yeah let them play with crayons at home breath </s>
but then on the right but then on the other hand if you got kids going to that school creative p per performing arts or whatever breath sometimes you need something like that to graduate out of there </s>
breath yeah that is true do you have any kids </s>
uh yeah i have two </s>
breath yeah i uh i have a little boy too and he is not artistic laugh breath </s>
i got a little daughter uh-huh no well my daughter is getting there she draws every day she writes she reads she is only six years old and she is reading on a fourth grade level </s>
that is great my son is really good at reading too </s>
right </s>
he is but he has trouble with math on the other hand </s>
okay yeah yeah she is like real sh sharp with that so you know hopefully breath i do not know man you know that issue right there is a touchy one right there breath my whole thing is the education first and you can get with the other stuff later </s>
right if they have enough money like it is kind of like that has to be down at the bottom of the list </s>
right because look what is going on right now especially with the schools right here in philadelphia </s>
cause it it got to be </s>
i mean they having a problem right now and then when street takes over breath office in january he has got to go to harrisburg to lobby for these millions of dollars man and breath they are waiting on him they had it in the papers the other day they said they are waiting on him cause he is going to have a hard way to go their whole thing is uh ridge done want hornbeck out they want him out of there he is not running the schools problems </s>
breath huh how is the schools in philly </s>
um they are alright it depends on which school you go to you know what i mean like my kids go to a academic school finletter's and that is like a real good school it is like the number two school here and you know as far as elementary schools well not elementary it is like a junior high and there is a little eltr elementary school built next to it you know what i mean </s>
do you pay extra for that </s>
so breath breath no no no it is free it is a public school </s>
it is a public school yeah </s>
it is a public school they have like uh they have certain exceptional public schools here breath then if you want a better education than that then you know you got to pay for private or for catholic or whatever </s>
yeah that is what we are doing right now i have i have one son and we are sacrificing for him right now cause the public schools in my area breath </s>
right so mhm </s>
a academically i am sure they are okay but i do not the the kids are they are they are they are nuts man and and </s>
right n yeah i understand what you saying laugh uh wh what area are you in where are you at </s>
you know what the biggest thing i i live in northeastern pennsylvania scranton wilkes-barre area breath it is i am sure </s>
oh you in wilks-barre okay </s>
yeah i am sure that that uh um i do not know what part of philly but i am sure there are some public schools in philly that you do not want your kids to be anywhere near </s>
oh no i do not want them to go the schools that i went to and i tell my son that all the time and my son is twelve years old he is in the seventh grade getting ready to go in to eighth grade breath and i told him when i was coming up there was gangs everything was in the school you know </s>
yes </s>
i told him his school is beautiful i love the school that they go to they have so much to offer these children there the programs and everything after school programs keeps them from being on the streets and this and that breath </s>
that is good </s>
the schools i went to soon as school was over they were kicking you out of the school it was gang wars all kinds of crazy stuff going on back then man so you know these kids got it made it is just up to them to put that you know that effort forward and go ahead and do what they got to do </s>
you are absolutely right the best thing that i like about the catholic school for my son is that every kid wears the exact same clothes to school every day </s>
you know right and that is what i told my son i wish they would pass the law here in philadelphia breath that they would make it mandatory that they have to wear uniforms cause that is where all the confusion comes is at breath you got these certain kids who are blessed that they were born with you know a silver spoon in their mouth the parents came up with money they come to school looking like a million dollars you got these other kids who don't look like that </s>
right right </s>
and the kids with money look down on them pick on them beat on them do all kinds of stuff breath if they all wearing the same thing they do not have nothing to look at each other there is no animosity is no this no jealousy no every you know what i am saying </s>
breath right alright is that a great idea </s>
and the only thing they focusing on that is right and the only thing they focusing on is education </s>
yes </s>
you know forget all that coming to school looking all clean and breath only time i want to see you dressed up is on your graduation day </s>
laugh </s>
you know what i mean laugh you dig what i am seeing laugh breath that is right </s>

right </s>
breath i bet you at least half of it i am saving on not having to buy him breath the best sneakers the best the best jeans breath </s>
that is right that is right </s>
cause if you seen what i am sure you spend uh if you seen the cost of clothes the smaller they are the more they cost </s>
that is r breath let me tell you something my son is twelve years old wears a thirty four waist a size eleven shoe he wears all men clothes you know what i am saying breath </s>
laugh </s>
and i am big myself but this guy he is costing me an arm and a leg man laugh breath </s>

lipsmack okay </s>
and she works really hard she is like a martyr it is like breath anybody in the world would want to be like her but you know of course we can not do it </s>
right of course well everybody is their own person you know </s>
breath i am sorry </s>
i said everybody is their own person so you know </s>
breath i know but you know what you sometimes wonder how </s>
breath </s>
people breath do people really have those kind of hearts breath because i try you know when you try to do everything right breath and it still do not come out that way breath </s>
oh i know the feeling </s>
like it still seems like you make bad decisions but then you got people that breath seem like they do not ever do anything wrong breath </s>
breath yeah i know what you mean breath </s>
and you wonder like how do you make it like that breath </s>
laugh breath i i know breath </s>
you know what i mean like do you really live your life everyday and just do everything right at all times breath </s>
breath i do not think anybody does you know i mean i think people probably come close to that or think they do but breath i mean everybody makes mistakes you know and everybody even even if people are trying are trying to do the right thing all the time breath you you can not </s>
uh-huh </s>
you know breath </s>
breath </s>
breath because breath </s>
but you know what hap go ahead </s>
lipsmack no i was just going to say that no matter what decision you make you know there is probably going to be somebody that is not happy with it you know like a big decision </s>
right </s>
you know so i mean it is kind of tough to really you you know like to have everyone respect you at the same time as like you </s>
uh-huh </s>
almost you know like sometimes you got to make tough decisions so breath it is tough to try and make the right ones everyday you know </s>
breath that is true and when you do breath for some reason if you try it whenever you make right decisions you always depend on somebody else breath </s>
of course </s>
i uh and you always end up getting stepped on breath </s>
oh definitely </s>
people eh a lot of people get over on my sister all the time so even though she is like a person that i admire so much breath i wish she could be like a little bit stronger than what she is to be able to say no sometimes breath </s>
well well does she always aim to please you know like all the time you know to the point where like people you know like </s>
i breath </s>
you said take advantage of her </s>
i think so </s>
yeah see that that could that could definitely be something where breath you try like you said you try and do the right thing all the time and breath you know there is people that take advantage you know there is people that are always going to take advantage of somebody who i guess they pick breath they consider maybe you know weaker or whatever you know what i mean </s>
uh-huh </s>
and and you know a lot of people are just so nice that they can not say no and they they get stepped on you know and i think that happens with just about anyone you know </s>
and then you end up really wearing yourself out breath like my mother does who who is another </s>
yeah exactly </s>
person that is one of my favorite people breath she ends up doing so much </s>
right </s>
for everybody she is so tired at the end of the day it is like she worked a twenty hour day </s>
breath right exactly i know it is it is tough you know it is it is like eh you you wish that everybody kind of was not i do not want to say necessarily the same type breath but everybody had the same goals but unfortunately everybody has different things that what they want and breath you know some people you know they they do not really care what happens to others you know and then you have somebody such as your mother who is really really nice and breath you know somebody could take advantage of that or your sister you know where they are just really nice and they </s>
right </s>
get taken advantage of </s>
that is right </s>
you know because they do not i i do not you know </s>
breath </s>
it is not that they do not know when to say no but it is just they are such nice people you know that it is it is it is out of character </s>
breath </s>
for them to try and disappoint someone you know what i mean </s>
that is right and i do not have a problem with it at all </s>
no well listen breath </s>
laugh breath </s>
as as long as you know what if i always looked at it if you want respect you got to give respect </s>
that is right </s>
you know and you know if you do not eh you know if if if people do not respect you you know they are they are going to take advantage of you in in many instances you know what i mean i work for a boss who is who is very easygoing and people try and take advantage of her you know sometimes breath um not always but sometimes you know and and she has to stand up for herself and when she does people are surprised because she is so polite and nice </s>
uh-huh breath </s>
that you know breath but she can separate it you know and say well you know breath even though i am real polite and nice you know i have to take a stand you know and she does breath and she does it very well you know so i mean that is that is kind of a person you know that i admire in a way because she she can kind of jump you know balance it between being nice and then also being tough at the same time you know and um you know a lot of people have found out i guess i do not want to say the hard way but found out that you know if you push her too far laugh </s>
breath </s>
breath you know she is going to fight back </s>
that is right cause you sort of </s>
you know </s>
back her into a corner breath </s>
yeah exactly exactly you know so yeah i mean when people get backed into a corner they can either just you know crawl down and you know let somebody beat on them or fight out of it you know it just depends what type of person you are </s>
uh-huh </s>
you know so i </s>
where is it that you work </s>

yeah well you know you've got girls now uh in certain parts of the country you have one or two girls that are being allowed to join the regular yeah football teams </s>
oh football teams mhm </s>

hm well breath yeah i don't know if i necessarily agree with women playing football </s>
laugh </s>
and those i think it could be a little too dangerous um </s>
well you know uh a lot of times i walk to work and if i don't watch where i'm going i can get hit by anything including a spaceship so </s>
cough breath yeah </s>
you might as well let the girl go ahead and try you know </s>
breath that's true at least give her the choice </s>
you know you </s>
um </s>
you don't know what you can do until you twist your arm or something </s>
lipsmack that's true i mean i think about i mean there's some some gentlemen who played football who breath are on the small side and they intend </s>
mhm </s>
when i guess it it doesn't i mean it hasn't killed the boys so i guess </s>
mhm </s>
now um do you watch um like winter sports like ice skating </s>
uh just nothing else on tv yeah i might just let the tv stay on for a few minutes and watch them the couples the couple i like to see the couples do it for a few minutes to the music </s>
okay is it ice sk figure skating </s>
yes some of those couples can go out there and dance like i dance on flat feet </s>
oh yeah </s>
on those skates and don't and and and very rarely do they miss you know miss the they can't tumble you know because they start taking points away from you and if and if you don't can't stand back up and get yourself back in position fast enough you start losing points </s>
hm </s>
but some of those people can really do that </s>
hm breath yeah it's amazing when i whenever i watch um like you know figure skating women's women's skating breath always amazed how they can skate and um not be so cold considering they're skating on ice </s>
yeah i don't know how they how that works for those clothes and everything </s>
oh my go wow </s>
it seems to me they start getting hot </s>
breath yeah i think that that helps like because you're you're you know doing a lot of vigorous movement breath but i just thought just kind of anything </s>
breath </s>
just it being air air-conditioned then everything else guess once the adrenaline starts pumping </s>
mhm </s>
you can forget now do you um do any sports yourself </s>
mm sitting down in front of the tv just as soon as i get in the door </s>
laugh </s>
that's my where's my control bar be honest with you a lot of times i i work on different shifts and the midnight shift is the i'm not a midnight worker but you know i'll find something to do for eight hours and when i come home in the morning sometimes i won't even have sense enough to go to sleep </s>
hm </s>
i'll just plop down in front of the tv all day </s>
breath well you were saying how um i mean you know the more active you stay with your sports you know the healthier you are </s>
mhm </s>
but </s>
it's a natural form of exercise yeah teaches you how to work with people and wh what you teaching you how to get along with other people too because you're going to you're going to meet people that are different from you no matter what </s>
breath yeah actually kind of when i um i used to play basketball in high school breath and um the people that i would </s>
mhm </s>
um just be around i would have probably never been around </s>
yeah </s>
if it wasn't for the learning how to be unified on a team </s>
mhm </s>
and um we have our own teams where none of those girls were my friends </s>
mhm </s>
but you know we became like a little family </s>
yeah </s>
yeah </s>
that too </s>
and you learn how to utilize everybody's strengths </s>
uh-huh </s>
the whole team you know and and now like i see um these sports teams and um you just wonder like if are they being unified um especially you see student um compare it </s>
uh y </s>
but co co community um service would be good i guess </s>
yeah i guess in general that would be a good topic </s>
yeah or so um their school participate uh their own communities and um hm just in case um breath um um if it uh temple university uh has a bad neighbor but if they uh i heard they do participate their neighbor activities and uh supposed to be good what do you do for a living john </s>
i work for a telecommunications company actually a wireless phone carrier </s>
which one </s>
for omnipoint </s>
oh this is third time for me too um talk um over the phone uh this </s>
pardon </s>
this is fir uh f uh third time um participating this </s>
yeah this is my first you have done this three already </s>
laugh breath </s>
i hope it gets easier </s>
all three of them are working omnipoint </s>
really all three of them </s>
yes uh-huh </s>
jeez </s>
the first two uh two were ah ladies and the third uh um breath was you but uh they all worked for omnipoint </s>
now is the phone you are using is it is gsm technology or </s>
yeah uh what is it uh is it uh global something </s>
global systems for mobile is the what that stands for </s>
lipsmack uh is it is it better than att's i know this is besides our um uh topics i don't i don't know what w breath i don't know </s>
that's uh yeah we community service we you know what what can i say about community service i i am not in school have not been did not do it then um breath the only service i give i don't really know if it is community service you know like i coach teams ball and stuff for little league and that that's only because my kids are in it </s>
i see my my church has com community service uh like uh uh participating there um um lipsmack you know um th their uh players and i mean the games and stuff like that but breath um lipsmack i don't know what to what to tell you about community service </s>
but anyway as far as phones go i mean i mean a att has a digital network but it is not the global systems for mobile and the gs the gsm systems </s>
so if </s>
you know one of the biggest selling points of it is it it truly is a global system you can roam anywhere in the world with it </s>
oh i see </s>
lipsmack in fact we just now signed a roaming agreement with with china so i guess omnipoint is the first company that you actually go into china and use use the network over there as well </s>
oh i see i see </s>
that's one of the that's one of the real big selling points to it </s>
mhm yeah i uh because of my business i have uh i have uh three dif four no uh five five phones five cellular phones </s>
phew </s>
um laugh breath one is a uh two is att and and one is us sprint uh two uh two is us sprint and one is omnipoint </s>
uh-huh </s>
that i am using for myself lipsmack um but </s>
so have you had good success with the omnipoint </s>
uh just um um i got it last mon i mean this month uh last month november um the the do you know are you familiar with nine thousand il </s>
yes </s>
nokia nine thousand il the big phone </s>
yeah yeah </s>
what breath yeah uh that one i have the com communicator um </s>

too big breath well they got some real tiny light weight ones now </s>
yeah too uh nine uh nine one one zero right nokia nine one </s>
yeah </s>
the the new one but uh are you going to carry this that phone omnipoint </s>
i believe so yeah we we are supposed to be pretty big with nokia products i don't i don't work in the i don't work around the sales at all i do all the lipsmack business reporting </s>
um um i see what was your major </s>
just general business business administration </s>
i see i see </s>
yeah i did was just i just kind of fell into the job i just came here for a regular job and started doing some reports for them and it is a new company </s>
uh-huh </s>
oh we are just now getting to be about three years old breath and when i got here they didn't really have anybody that could do any kind of reporting and they saw the work and breath it has been real it has been real good for me they have formed a group i have a group of six people that work with me </s>
um </s>
and it it has gone real well it has been a good company to work for because it is young </s>
i see i see </s>
it is a young company so there is a lot of opportunities here and </s>
uh-huh </s>
it is a very fast paced company i you don't get bored </s>
i see </s>
uh you you come into work in the morning you are shocked that it is time to go home that is how fast the days go </s>
um that is good </s>
but we are being in the process of of uh we are going to be bought out in january so we will see what happens after the new company takes us over </s>
uh somebody else is going to take over </s>
yeah yeah a company called company called voicestream </s>
oh </s>
they have the same technology we do at except they are in the western part of the united states </s>
i see </s>
so basically they are they are buying us and another company and they are they are going to put together a nationwide network just like what omnipoint had except that it will be nationwide cause one of the one of the problems now is that once you get out of our network the phones get very expensive lipsmack you know if you were down in tampa florida you could still use your phone </s>
uh-huh </s>
but you w you end up roaming and then you you pay a lot of roaming charges and the service gets very expensive so this will be one one large nationwide network </s>
so so it is international oh if you go to china uh they they charge for roaming right </s>
yes yeah </s>
so how much are they </s>
well what they have though i mean they they are pretty smart in their marketing the way they market this stuff so if you were if you are a business man let's say and you do a lot of international travelling </s>
right </s>
yeah so just make a a room that you know someone can go in that people can go into but it is vent ventilated so all the smoke can be in shoved outside breath you know </s>
mhm </s>

oh okay </s>
hello </s>
hello oh my name is sam </s>
how you do hey sam i am keith </s>
alright do you believe in ghosts </s>
do i believe in ghosts um </s>
uh-huh </s>
well not really sure to be honest with you i i think breath i guess i kind of do </s>
i believe it is uh more or less conjecture </s>
how how about you </s>
because everything that i have seen in a lifetime i have not ranned into no ghosts yet </s>
you have not run into any ghosts well i have not seen any myself </s>
uh-huh cause i actually you know like how folklore is </s>
mhm </s>
just like the werewolf just like dracula just like the loch ness monster you know all that is folklore you still with me </s>
yeah yeah i am still here </s>
all uh-huh all that is folklore because ah just like ah i know you seen ah cyclops </s>
mhm </s>
the fifty foot woman the mummy you know and just like i said in a realistic circumstance i have not breath been to no haunted houses no i believe in spirits more or less then ghosts you know and somebody you know that died that you are really close to you might take a step back and think you see a reflection of them passing in front of you you know </s>
mhm </s>
i believe in spirits but not not ghosts </s>
well i i know what you are saying about spirits and all that um </s>
mhm </s>
but i do not know if if they took you into some house where they assumed it was haunted then they put you in the and you sleep in the like the room breath or the house and you by yourself </s>
mhm </s>
you probably would be a little bit freaked out i know i would be even though i am not one to believe in too much of the supernatural </s>
no if somebody if somebody could take and actually program your head </s>
i think that is </s>
good enough enough you got some of that into your own psyche on a day to day basis like somebody breath that is paranoid or either a schizo you know </s>
mhm </s>
it could p probable on a fifty percent ratio you could take and actually believe that is haunted you know it is um breath a mind set thing you know </s>
mhm </s>
that is that is what i believe is more or less just like um breath they say about people that is um that is ah susceptible to being hypnotized they say even with that there is only breath conditioning and there is actually how you actually what your mind set what you believe in you know if you believe in it it could become a reality for you you know </s>
oh sure you have got to that actually something is true but ah for me if they put me in you know some haunted house or maybe for say like for example you are in an abandoned house that someone was killed in previously </s>
mhm </s>
murder in that house </s>
that right </s>
you probably would be you probably would be a little bit leery about staying in it overnight i know i would </s>
uh-huh </s>
not necessarily i am firm believer in ghosts but there is still a sp make you think twice about it you know and i would be a little bit uneasy how about you sam </s>
i have looked at still in the same respect yes i do not think i would have no uh inhibitions about it far as me believing that </s>
uh-huh </s>
tragedy could happen in that circumstance because tragedy happened previous to the time that i have actually entered on the scene itself you know </s>
mhm </s>
i am i am going on more or less ah just like i said my own personal upbringing my own encounters with different things </s>
uh-huh </s>
just like i said breath as a hole i have not ranned into no ghosts i have not been into no haunted houses you know so just like i ah said to me it would be a mind-set thing you know as far as the total believer then i would have some inhibitions about believing totally you know </s>
absolutely </s>
that is where i am at with it you know </s>
mhm </s>
there is ah it is a personal ah acceptability about the situation you know </s>
it happens if you believe it is going to happen </s>
that is a fact </s>
then you are probably going to s your mind will make you see things that probably are not realistic </s>
mhm i am going to tell you too i am going to throw this at you just like how kind of your suspicions about friday the thirteenth do not let a black cat walk down your </s>

okay </s>
i do not know i i breath you know it sounds really kind of wimpy but ah you know i would like that too i would like world peace i would like you know good things for the entire world so nobody had to worry about food or or clothing or medical attention that kind of thing </s>
it would have to be a better place to be </s>
it would it would definitely have to be a better place so i would like that </s>
how about unlimited </s>
and the third thing </s>
free air time that is a good wish </s>
laugh </s>
laugh </s>
breath that would be pretty cool would not it laugh breath </s>
laugh </s>
and the third thing you know i might just give the third wish to my husband and let him </s>
oh yeah </s>
let him choose something </s>
hm hm okay </s>
i know what he would he would probably choose to win the lottery knowing him </s>
think so </s>
i think yeah he is a very </s>
hm </s>
down to earth kind of person you know </s>
laugh </s>
give him something tangible laugh </s>
which but which presents a whole another group of problems what do you do with the money </s>
oh right yeah but you know not for nothing but that is kind of a happy problem you know </s>
laugh yeah </s>
laugh i could deal with that kind of problem </s>
yeah i think i will just use my third wish to get some more wishes if that is do-able </s>
you think so laugh </s>
i do not whether that is a legal move or not </s>
breath i do not know you know that that is kind of cheating but they did not mention that </s>
it did not work in aladdin but hey they did not they did not set it as a p they did not rule it out why not </s>
right that is true they never set it up as a no no </s>
you know laugh </s>
breath oh that is really funny breath </s>
i mean </s>
i get a big kick out of these questions they are asking </s>
yeah some of them were okay </s>
i think this is fun yeah some of them are really pretty funny </s>
a little thought provoking </s>
oh yeah exactly i think the last one </s>
have you </s>
i am sorry </s>
what did you get what did you get last time </s>
the last one was ah how did i feel about or how did we feel about uh the proposed ban on smoking in every p public arena you know every public area </s>
uh ha uh ha </s>
and uh the person i was talking to and i were happily in sync breath laugh </s>
laugh okay </s>
but it was great you know breath </s>
laugh </s>
but it does not leave a whole lot open for discussion at that point when when you ah all agree on everything </s>
that is true that is true </s>
there is no room for discussion </s>
well there is no limit on how far you can go with three wishes </s>
wishes yeah breath </s>
yeah </s>
what is that old saying if wishes were horses then beggars would ride </s>
yeah </s>
right </s>
yeah </s>
we would have a lot of people riding horses </s>
that is for sure </s>
or or driving cars in this day and age </s>
yeah </s>
so the </s>
but you do not ah i know there may be a lot of folks with with wishes but i do not know too many people really have dreams anymore folks have kind of given up on their dreams </s>
you know that is true i was just talking m my daughter is twenty one and i was just talking to her not too long ago about what she was dreaming about what were her hopes and dreams </s>
yeah </s>
and um she really had a hard time coming up with anything </s>
yeah </s>
yeah what she was </s>
i know </s>
w all all she was able to focus on was her career but life is a whole lot more than just work so </s>
right </s>
that is tough that is real tough </s>
yeah yeah </s>
but well </s>
i think folks need to focus more maybe on their dreams than on their wishes because wishes really do not have a whole lot of substance to them </s>
breath no it is like hope </s>
i mean i i mean i laugh </s>
you know </s>
i i do not get up in the morning thinking about my wishes you know </s>
right exactly exactly breath you know wishes are wonderful but the they are kind of i do not know im un impractical i would i would rather have a goal </s>
yeah yeah absolutely </s>
and work towards it </s>
absolutely that is what life is about </s>
yeah yeah at least if it is worth living that is what it is about </s>
tr trying to make your wishes come true </s>
yeah exactly </s>
yeah yeah </s>
if you use them as goals instead of as just these ethereal kind of things out there then then they are more more apt to come true at that point i think </s>
yeah absolutely i mean i have got three kids and that is what i tell them </s>
how old are they </s>
well one is nineteen </s>
okay </s>
he he is in college </s>
mhm </s>
and one is ten </s>
mhm </s>
and the baby is five </s>
oh my that is a nice spread too good gosh </s>
yeah yeah they are a lot of fun </s>
lipsmack yeah i would imagine it has been long time my daughter is twenty one years old so breath </s>
oh wow </s>
it has been a long time since we had a baby in the house </s>
yeah </s>
that that </s>
endless entertainment </s>
oh definitely </s>
and cheap too laugh </s>
laugh no electricity meeting </s>
laugh that is right </s>
you know breath a little bit of little bit of fuel three times a day and that is it right </s>
that is right </s>
laugh oh that is really cool </s>
yeah well what is your daughter doing </s>
breath right now she is working ah for a company called ah yadrow and she is she is in inventory management </s>
okay </s>
somebody sends me recently um a christmas game like that was designed by some like computer software company </s>
mhm </s>
um they sent it to me by e-mail and i s you know saved it to my hard drive because i have kids i i work in a breath counseling center so i have kids sometimes come visit me th just hanging out waiting for their parents or something so i figured i would save it to occupy them breath </s>
oh that is that is a good idea </s>
yeah well it works th i just had somebody in here using it it was re it was kind of cute it was elf bowling there was a santa clause and there were like elves th tw ten elves at the end of the screen </s>
oh how cute </s>
and th and you would just press the space bars so it was really simple for kids to breath play with laugh </s>
laugh breath it sounds great i am sure kids would really enjoy something like that </s>
yeah </s>
um i have a daughter who is uh going to be seventeen tomorrow laugh </s>
laugh </s>
and uh breath she never really e when she was younger she used to play games on the computer um breath she still occasionally will play um like card games like solitaire and um stuff like that and on the computer </s>
yeah breath that is right yeah </s>
but um you know </s>
solitaire was a big one </s>
mhm now my husband my husband loves to play games on the computer </s>
soli laugh </s>
you know he really enjoys it it of course he does not have much time to but when he does um you know if he if he is um home and does not have anything else to do he will go up on the computer and breath he has a couple of games installed on the computer that he um really enjoys </s>
yeah their is other things that i would prefer to do on the computer or like i will go on the internet and find you know interesting waste time i will waste time on the computer just not with games laugh </s>
hm do you have the internet </s>
uh-huh </s>
breath do you find that it is beneficial to you </s>
oh yeah a one of my one a my next door neighbor </s>
no </s>
you know denies that the c internet is of any use at all but um she needed a a keros one of her her sons um was buying a home and always admired one of her lamps and it was like an antique lamp </s>
mhm </s>
and so she wanted eh and she did not know the manufacturer like the the number that you call the manufacturer or anything and so she she comes to me and she says do not tell my son </s>
laugh </s>
laugh and can you see if you can find the name of the company you know the company and see if they are still making these things laugh breath </s>
laugh breath laugh </s>
laugh so i said i would try and i did it was like only three clicks and i found it and i gave it to her so she now now she now she can get her son a christmas present laugh </s>
oh that is terrific </s>
laugh </s>
see it does come in han we do not have the internet hooked up breath and you know we have been thinking about doing it um you know we have been considering it and you i was just wondering how how much of value it is to you know invest in it breath um like i said i know my daughter has been after us to do it laugh </s>
laugh well right now it is not like the information that is on the internet you can mostly get through other like the essential stuff </s>
mhm </s>
the stuff that i go on the internet to find and i can usually find in other ways but it just um like you know calling somebody but it just sometimes seems easier to do it myself then to use the uh you know by the internet than to than to use the phone </s>
mhm </s>
but it does require like a certain amount of facility with it because you know what happens is the the way that somebody sets up their home sight they will they use what other people have used like the way that they do it like they will organize into certain like when you when you have a a table of contents in a book </s>
yes </s>
once your familiar with the way a table of contents works like the introduction comes first then you know then you know you have the appendixes and stuff like that that is the basic structure of a book but on the internet there is the same thing but except they are not called things like that they are called like frequently asked questions or breath con how to contact us so that once you have seen a couple of them you get then to know the easiest way to find what you are looking for or even if you have never been to that particular sight before </s>
i see now did you did you need any special training to learn how to use the internet or was it something that just is self explanatory when you go into it </s>
um eh i think it is th the thing to know is th you can not really do any damage to it so laugh so you just have to sort of like be bold then go around and play with it </s>
mhm </s>
but mhm </s>
i know that was the f that was our biggest problem when we first got our personal computer </s>
uh-huh </s>
um we were always afraid that we were going to hit the wrong button and laugh breath </s>
laugh </s>
somehow mess everything up you know </s>
laugh </s>
oh i know my husband was like that when he first started breath it was like he was terrified of it you know </s>
yeah </s>
now he is not because he he is breath um at work he had to um his uh he works as a receiver in a super market breath and they went under a computer system for the receiving breath uh going back a couple years ago breath and working with it through work um he became real familiar with it and he realized that you know we really can not mess it up too badly laugh so </s>
laugh </s>
so then he d decided to you know do a little more with our computer at home </s>
yeah </s>
and uh he uh he really enjoys it </s>
yeah well i think it is worth while to get the internet but not mo mostly not to get information </s>
mhm </s>
um because like i said you can get it from other places but m more so that you can communicate with other people like i would be ha very happy if my mom got it because so that i could uh i could send her e-mail rather than calling her frequently </s>
uh-huh </s>
you know what i mean and you can send stuff hm you know like pictures and stuff and and particularly with like long distance relationship </s>
they will be able to test him for drugs but just for just for the sake of doing it no i do not agree with that </s>
a actually i have the total opposite of you laugh point of view laugh </s>
breath because a lot of times you are not you do not i it </s>
breath ah </s>
does not necessarily mean that you are on drugs do you know what i mean and i in sometimes i think that would be a violation breath </s>
oh i see what you are saying </s>
like if i came in tired one day and they said they want to test me for drugs like breath immediately sometimes you can uh use racism as a oh you are only doing that because i am black or you are only doing it because i am this do you know what i am saying breath if you are not guilty of it </s>
right oh i see what you were saying </s>
you know what i am saying like if somebody followed you around the the shopping center you say you are going to think of an excuse to why they are doing it especially if you are not doing anything wrong </s>
exactly yeah </s>
go ahead i am sorry i interrupted your take on it </s>
no that is okay that is okay because i mean we have it at our jobs so i it is like and they just do them at on random but i just noticed that it seems like the the same people seem to be going all the time </s>
uh-huh </s>
but i i </s>
and do they ever come up positive </s>
no not i mean not because you are still there laugh </s>
breath so now if the same people would not you consider that to be like harassment </s>
i guess it could be in one respect i mean because i never really even thought about it </s>
uh-huh </s>
yeah i i u </s>
breath i i mean like when they breath when they when initially when you get hired for employment i could understand them testing you for drugs </s>
mhm </s>
who wants to hire somebody that is on drugs breath you know you take great losses when you hire those kind of employees but </s>
right </s>
breath during the week of your performance is up and you know what i am saying if your performance is satisfactory breath </s>
right </s>
see what the reason would be to be testing people for drugs for what breath unless it is noted in the beginning breath that this could happen under certain circumstances do you know what i am saying it is sort of like not fair game </s>
oh yeah </s>
i am sorry </s>
yeah i see i see what you are saying alright yeah i understand what you are saying </s>
breath </s>
but yeah i i guess i just never really you know ah i just never really thought about it no once it comes up when it comes i just go ahead and do whatever it is i have to do because i know you know what i am saying </s>
uh-huh breath i guess you can have two breath you can think about that two ways because then you you got to think about the safety of the other employees as well because actually i work for a substance abuse treatment program and then you have somebody that is on drugs </s>
oh </s>
a lot of the employers have sent their people to our facility breath because they they were stealing from the other employees you know what i mean going in other people's purses breath </s>
oh </s>
and that kind of thing so you i think positive and negative about that because you do not want to jeopardize other employees by keeping them aboard and not testing them just because they are going to be angry if you do </s>
exactly </s>
but then if they are not doing it you know what i am saying so it is sort of </s>
so it is i i it is kind of like a catch twenty-two you know laugh </s>
exactly </s>
you win it i mean you are damned if you do and damned if you do not so it is </s>
i guess it is pr probably better to take the safer approach and just um wow i just changed my own mind </s>
laugh </s>
breath i guess it is better to take the safer approach breath and to test them because even if they come up negative either way around you know what i mean what can be the harm in doing it </s>
right right you know i mean i mean they are all basically there for the same reason and hopefully you know you do not have that ac that kind of activity going on in in the workplace i would hope not you know so </s>
do you have random testing at your employments </s>
yeah we do and actually they just started it within the last year </s>
uh-huh </s>
well yeah i mean </s>
where w where is it that you are employed if you do not mind me asking </s>
i work for omnipoint communications </s>
do you really breath </s>
uh-huh </s>
you are the second omnipoint person i talked to </s>
laugh yeah </s>
laugh it is amazing that i keep getting omnipoint people you sound like somebody that i know that is why uh </s>
yeah laugh no yeah i work for omnipoint but yeah i mean they just started doing but i do not know what the reason or you know why they decided because when i know when i first started there it was not i mean you got your drug test right when you actually started the company </s>
w </s>
and that was it </s>
uh-huh do not you have do not but they they give you breath phones and stuff to have in your possession am i correct </s>
yes </s>
and see these things can be sold for drug money you know what i am saying breath </s>
what </s>
at a place that you do not really have anything that anybody can see now i do not i do not agree with that never mind i am not even going to make that statement </s>
laugh </s>
what is your first name if you do not mind me asking </s>
my name is vanessa </s>
vanessa okay </s>
right right </s>
wait how long have we do we have to talk six minutes </s>
i believe it is five minutes </s>
okay i guess they will they usually cut us off right </s>
i do not know because this is actually the first phone call that i have actually gotten </s>
really </s>
mhm </s>
i think this is my third phone call that i have that i have participated in breath so far and each call i actually made it </s>
yeah oh really laugh </s>
laugh breath i have not received any phone calls yet </s>
oh okay okay </s>
even mc donald's these days are testing people for drugs breath it is amazing </s>
oh really </s>
yeah because years ago when you went to work at mc donald's you just filled out an application and you just that is it </s>
right </s>
they are testing fourteen year old kids now </s>
oh wow i never even thought about that either </s>
how can you go wrong with mom laugh </s>
laugh breath </s>
breath i mean dad did a lot of shady things but mom was always there laugh </s>
laugh breath well when i always saw him my mom was always there to pick me up </s>
yeah that is true i can say even in my adult life when i had some problems you know with marriages with women whatever ah there is always one person i could rely on that had the uh you know had my back </s>
laugh breath </s>
and i guess that would be her i would have to say she is the person i most admire and you know she is not here any longer but i think about her all the time and i think about the things that uh you know i learned from her </s>
lipsmack oh wow </s>

well i th </s>
sometimes like my mother is not there </s>
yeah </s>
yeah i think that way i am like okay well my mother would not do this laugh </s>
laugh ah i i think i have to reflect back on some of the things she has taught me in the past because </s>
breath </s>
breath i mean there is nobody that i really feel you know can give me that kind of insight everybody has got opinions on breath you know how things should be but they do not your best interests at heart all the time you know breath so i think i have to rely on uh you know all those years of practice that she had with me breath and just put those in play </s>

mankind but it still has its um lipsmack its um high moments you know for for myself and sh should be for a lot of other people you know </s>
right breath to some people it is only a piece of fabric </s>
correct </s>
and it is it is a colored fabric and it does not mean anything </s>
mhm </s>
and that is how they feel about it they do not really understand its meaning </s>
mhm </s>
and the reason it was created </s>
mhm what was i going to say just like you said cough breath a lot of people do not know why it why it was created you know they need to find out the history of it and they need to um breath understand what the stripes mean the different colors what it means breath what each star stands for um why betsy ross um knitted this flag why she made the flag why she made the colors she made it you know um um lot of people just do not understand that um it is a it is a it is a sacrament you know just like we treat our religion </s>
right </s>
you know um and that is the way they need to look at it the same way they treat their religion if they if they have faith in the religion then they can also have because it speaks about it in the scriptures that we should honor what is um caesar's and honor what is god's </s>
that is right </s>
you know and what they mean by honor what is ceasar's honor what is of the land you know </s>
right </s>
so therefore um we are to honor some things that um man sets atonement for but we are so wrapped up in worldly things that um we do not even god's things how we going to honor man's things </s>
right and some people do not honor anything </s>
that is what i am saying they really do not it is it is just crazy </s>
they do not have respect for anything </s>
lipsmack and our young generation is coming up i hate to say it you know they just do not have no respect even for their parents and that is one of the number one commandments of the bible </s>
that is right </s>
you know so how do you expect for them to have respect for a flag </s>
right </s>
they look at it as a piece of cloth breath and they probably study it in school and it do not and it do not even sink in </s>
right </s>
you know breath i feel </s>
they do not pay attention either you know because it is not for them it is nothing it is just something to take up their time </s>
mhm that is all they just want to make it through it </s>
right they want to get of there and get out and go party or something </s>
laugh </s>
and they do not want to be bothered </s>
no they do not no they do not but um like i said by me being a veteran myself um i have the most respect for it i think they need to bring back you know we used to sing we used to do the pledge of allegiance at school </s>
of course </s>
they do not do that no more that is why they do not have a aspect for flag no more number one </s>
you are kidding </s>
no they do not do that in schools no more </s>
i did not know that </s>
no do a survey find out i know they do not </s>
that is terrible </s>
they do not pledge allegiance to the flag no more in school not to my knowledge i have not seen it done because my children do not even do it in school every morning when i was going to school we had to get up breath and and say the pledge of allegiance to the flag </s>
that is right so did i </s>
as a yo as a young man but they do not do it now they they one time they had it on the news they took it out of the schools they sure did </s>
well that does not show e give much of an example to the children then either </s>
that is right </s>
because if the government steps in and says you do not have to do it well what does that what message does it send to the children </s>
and the flag is supposed to represent the government </s>
that is right </s>
so why would the government condone something like that </s>
that is right </s>
i do not i do not understand it i really do not if that is the case then why are we going overseas fighting wars that we do not create </s>
laugh that is right </s>
laugh you understand what i am saying </s>

yes </s>
that these are the priorities and this is what should be done </s>
mhm </s>

that is right that is very true </s>
and this would help the children that are coming up because it looks like the world is going to be a terrible place to live soon </s>

she was a preemie i had her two months early she was three pounds three ounces so breath </s>

 </s>
i was like just save my baby save my baby you know </s>

yeah breath i mean not even that everybody says oh when you're pregnant nobody wants to be they think they look ugly oh no </s>
well i think that they should do an ability test instead of just a blood alcohol test </s>
eh ah ah oh but they do give the </s>
because yeah but see the thing is is that they base it all on the blood alcohol level </s>
right </s>
and certain people have more resistance against alcohol then other people do but at the same time if you are drinking you should not be driving because it is going to effect you even if </s>
sh um right you know everybody i mean you might have a higher tolerance but you are and you know </s>
mhm </s>
ability to react to things your reflex are affected either way </s>
right </s>
so that way there you you have to um i think if you are caught period you know license should be revoked or breath </s>
mhm </s>
not not not not saying like forever for maybe like a month and each time you are caught </s>
mhm </s>
the eh eh the penalty is more severe </s>
right i think that is how it is right now though i think the first time you can actually get a fine if you have never done that before and you have a clean record completely breath </s>
um no right </s>
like you screw up once they will give you a fine so you got to pay for it in the pocketbook then the next time you get it revoked for a little bit of time then it gets more and then you just can not get a license anymore </s>
right and now now if the case happens to escalate though if you are in a driving you are drinking and driving and you happen to have an accident or god and god forbid someone dies </s>
mhm </s>
but eh then ah it should be more severe then just </s>
oh yeah </s>
then just a little regular pulled over yeah and your license are revoked i think </s>
from just being pulled over </s>
people because it seems like now as it is people do not take it seriously </s>
mhm </s>
oh drinking and driving oh i can do that it does not matter you know </s>
yeah </s>
laugh </s>
i do not know we take it pretty seriously because the people that i hang around with we all designate someone and the people that i work with obviously do that too because we did that this past week i mean we were in dallas and we had rental cars so laugh everybody was being really good and it was really surprising to see that because i mean i am twenty-one and so were the other people that were there </s>
right </s>
and we are the young ones so laugh it was really interesting to see </s>
so </s>
how we all reacted to it and it you know there was very little if none that were </s>
oh hm okay </s>
over the legal limit but i don't even know what their legal limit is so i was ju laugh i was like i ain't drinking at all laugh </s>
right huh right right </s>

laugh breath exact but see yeah and they always expect us young ones because i i'll be twenty three this year and they all expect us expect them to you know be the ones to m </s>
mhm well the people that i see that do it most often are like between thirty five and forty five </s>
right right th </s>
because they think they can handle it and it is like wait a second breath </s>
breath </s>
i i can handle a lot of alcohol that is not a problem but once that alcohol is in my system </s>
right </s>
the law tells me i am not allowed to drive it is like the law tells me i can not break into my neighbor's house and take his stereo i do not do it </s>
laugh you know laugh breath and the law the </s>
you know laugh breath they made these laws for a reason laugh and it was not to make our lives hell </s>
right na breath but that is </s>
but </s>
that is how it is though and i i think they need to be a little more on sterner on their law </s>
yeah mhm </s>
for drunk driving because if and even if they have to you know make have a couple of sacrificial lambs and </s>
mhm </s>
and use people as an example </s>
mhm </s>
to see that they are not going to take it i think it would work </s>
mhm </s>
help a lot of people get the message that oh wow they are really serious </s>
mhm </s>
you know not just lipsmack aw yeah i got a drunk driving thing i just got a ticket and you know cop told me i had to </s>
well see i saw i saw some i have seen people who have had their liscense revoked for up to six months </s>
breath yeah but but </s>
and it does make an impact but it is a shame that it takes that long to do it </s>
breath yeah </s>
because they got caught like three times before they got their liscense and i know someone else who's got caught at least five times and has never spent more than a night in jail because daddy is rich </s>
right laugh breath </s>
well that hasn't taught him his fucking lesson breath you know laugh </s>
breath see that is what i need laugh </s>
because he keeps doing it and it is like wait a second that is not cool and it is like i don't want to be anywhere near wherever you are going laugh breath </s>
breath laugh </s>
you are going here i will go in the opposite direction laugh breath </s>
right right that is exactly what i was thinking be like oh no i need to be in the opposite direction you are a police magnet laugh breath </s>
mhm </s>
it was given to the jews by god </s>
yeah exactly </s>
so it rightfully is is uh </s>
it is it is the holy it is the holy land </s>
yeah exactly </s>
the just just like you said </s>
and uh but the the uh palestinians their they do not want to believe that they want to believe it is their land and it is not </s>
exactly exactly </s>
cough but there is no way they are going to give it up either of them laugh </s>
yeah well you know guess you got to deal with it </s>
yeah </s>
in a way in a way it seems that there never will be be complete peace but you know maybe maybe if all these conflicts stop take a lot of work laugh breath take </s>
uh yeah there will have to be a lot of compromises made any anything is going to be achieved over there </s>
yeah exactly exactly </s>
and the tho those are like two kinds of two two peoples that do not believe in compromise too much at all laugh </s>
yeah exactly exactly breath so where are you from </s>

yeah i know i i know that but i am i am saying i do not know if we are sup really supposed to stay stay to the top topic at all or what </s>
oh no i mean well i i talked to the guy when i talked to the guy i asked him basically what do people talk about and they he said you know they give a topic and basically they do stray off the topic because the topic is talked for it is just an ice breaker you know what i mean </s>
yeah </s>
so is this your is this your first call </s>
but it oh no this is like i i have received four now </s>
uh-huh </s>
this is my first one that i actually got got through to someone </s>

yup </s>
last guy i actually talked to was talking about like how we were possibly getting set up for the uh wireless web </s>

definitely </s>
i guess that is that is pretty much what it is about too you know making making the good money </s>
mhm </s>
which is always nice </s>
but i do not as far as as far as peace in the middle east i do not think that is going to happen </s>
no no i i would not see it just because there is there is too much conflict the there there is no compromise like in sight you know it is it is it does not seem that </s>
mhm </s>
in in a way it does not seem like the compromise wants to be made even you know </s>
oh no they do not want to they do not want to give each give each other anything </s>
no why why why would they you know why would they want to in a way i mean it is a bad thing to say but you know they they do what they have to do of course we get to stick our noses in it laugh </s>
cough yeah well we do that everywhere </s>
breath we have to do that breath that is s a thing that you have to do breath just because if you do not go ahead and stick your nose in the business people will think what will you do in the time that you need to stick your nose in the business breath </s>
yeah </s>
i mean i guess that is what they look at you know being being a high powered country breath you know they are they are going to look at that sort of stuff laugh have no choice </s>
oh boy </s>
not bad not bad </s>
so how time we got left </s>
breath i do not know let me see hold on for a second </s>
laugh </s>
actually still checking let me see here we are actually almost over </s>
okay that is good </s>
you know there is always a chance that some psycho out there is going to come and shoot you you know </s>
yeah that is true </s>
so i think generally they are fairly safe but you never can guarantee anything you know </s>
that is true </s>
no matter how affluent a neighborhood you live in or lipsmack you know no matter what you are doing there is always that chance that uh you know and a lot of the public schools too you know they talk about the quality is down you know you do not get as good an education as you used to get i do not think they are as good as they used to be </s>
n yeah i am o i am only twenty-five laugh i do not know how they used to be um i thought my education was okay though they probably do not get paid as enough and there is not enough incentive incentives for them to do better but breath </s>
hm yeah </s>
i definitely am </s>
yeah it is not as not as glamorous to be like a teacher anymore as it used to be you know </s>
yeah </s>
cough they do not pay them very well and breath and some of the kids have those attitudes too anymore </s>
laugh yeah aw no definitely not </s>
th they are not nearly as respectful what do you think yeah the you know some teachers put up with a lot of crap everyday so i do not know i think the you know that who can afford a private school you know they are like fifteen twenty thousand dollars a year </s>
yeah i know </s>
so i do not know probably not as good as they used to be but you can still get a fairly good education just uh </s>
do you have kids </s>

so i was i went to the schools you know back in the early eighties when it was not that bad </s>
hm yeah that is one i when to well yeah i graduated in eighty-eight so eh you know it is y i never really was worried about my safety or like that you know </s>

oh really oh really </s>
but i can not bri yeah i can not bring myself to make outgoing calls i do not know </s>
how come </s>
because i do not really get a chance to because the computer you are not allowed to make um another call within a twenty-four period </s>
oh okay breath </s>
and twenty-four hours is like right now you called me breath so until five oh clock tomorrow i can not make or receive another call so by then i totally do not want to call </s>
hm yeah yeah that is true you can not </s>
cough like i get out of work and the last thing i want to do is worry about </s>
yeah then they call you </s>
so i get i re yeah i have received them way more than i have made them and i have to make them because i do not know if that will like if i will forfeit if i do not make the calls or not </s>
yeah oh breath </s>
but receive a check did you </s>
w w no not yet i just made my f got my first call about three days ago </s>
breath oh okay yeah because they said they were sending everybody's checks out </s>
yeah i just my first call i think on thursday </s>
huh </s>
but i guess we do not have much more to say about the school system though i am not that you know moved either way on it </s>
you what </s>
i guess we do not have that much more to say about the school system you know since we are not in school and we do not have any kids in school </s>
laugh breath laugh like yeah well they are flexible about what you talk about actually </s>
you know yeah </s>
i mean i guess they give you a topic and then they want you to discuss it wh a few conversations i have had we did not even discuss the topic we just totally talked nah we just totally talked about whatever </s>
no really yeah </s>
because one time a girl called me and the topic was breath what is your idea of a romantic evening and what would you like to do now between two girls who wants to you know what i mean it was just awkward so we totally talked about work we did not even talk about it </s>
yeah yeah th that is kind of strange i hope they give us our money as soon as possible breath </s>
laugh yeah well like i said i got a call the other day she said they i guess they mail you a check for one phone call so it is a twelve dollar check </s>
yeah the first call and then they after six weeks they mail you the rest time you know whatever how many calls you took or made whatever </s>
mhm so they oh my god my i do not know how many weeks it has been but i know it is getting ready to be at least four </s>
oh really it is only my first week so </s>
so i guess that is why she said i got to hurry up and make those calls </s>
yes i did </s>
breath oh i um i have very very limited college experience and i did um </s>
yes i did uh-huh </s>
breath something totally like different like i went straight into the work force right after school and um just now i am starting to go back and i am doing it on-line </s>
uh-huh </s>
breath and um i am finding it extremely extremely convenient </s>
uh ha wow that is interesting </s>
so uh breath yeah i mean like i would almost advise uh breath basically let the kid wh do what they want to do like you know if they do not want to jump right into college let them into the work force </s>
mhm </s>
because a lot of the times now you can get tuition assistance which is very cool and have uh a company pay for the tuition or at least a good part of it </s>
right </s>
breath um and the on-line thing is just so convenient man </s>
i believe it and i actually you let the kid do what they want takes the words right out of my mouth </s>
yeah because i mean like if your eighteen years old and your parents like kind of like throw you into college whether you know be whatever it is are they really going to get the most out of it </s>
uh mhm i can not tell you </s>
you know sometimes yes sometimes no i definitely i know i definitely was not ready for it you know what i mean </s>
mhm i can i can not tell you how many people i went to school with who were not ready to be there uh they were not rea </s>
yeah you are you are very lucky that you made it out did you go right after high school or </s>
breath yeah i did i did i actually took some time off in the middle uh because i i was one of those people who m might not have been totally ready to be there </s>
laugh </s>
right away </s>
i know the feeling </s>
so yep breath but now it has it has worked out i met my wife at college and life is good </s>
that is very good i mean that is one thing that i do look back at and i regret though i mean like a lot of people </s>
mhm </s>
a around like the same pace as me already have a degree and i do not </s>
mhm </s>
and i kind of wish i did </s>
yeah yeah that is eh how i felt during those th that time off that i took people were graduating and they were in my class but now i am not with them anymore </s>
breath but the on-line is interesting i mean it is what is what i like about it is um </s>
but mhm </s>
you know i am a single provider for my family and uh </s>
mhm </s>
you know i work a lot of hours so uh you know the convenience of being able to like attend classes at like midnight or three o clock in the morning is excellent </s>
how does that work is it is it sort of a chat type thing or is it a here is your assignment and do it </s>
almost almost what happens is like you lo i go to um the university of phoenix </s>
uh-huh </s>
and um cough what you do is you log on and uh your professor will basically send you all the reading assignments and homework assignments and uh in the beginning of the semester you order like about three or four huge books it is it is definitely a lot of work it is very fast-paced </s>
mhm </s>
it is very aggressive </s>
uh-huh </s>
um cough but you know you will have to read like a couple chapters it is a seven day a week thing each semester is five weeks long and that is it there is no way you could possibly take more than one class a shot </s>
yeah </s>
um you download all your assignments um and then you have to like answer questions about the reading and uh then the professor will throw out different types of questions about like the business world and stuff </s>
mhm </s>
and um you basically reply to the question and then the other classmates will also reply to the questions and kind of like bring up a few interesting topics here and there they may ask you questions about your response and then you just go back and forth um and you get the answers basically like you know you will submit all your answers to the questions and then maybe later on or the next day you will log back in and you will get responses to your questions an fire o fire off more comments here and there it goes very quick um </s>
mhm </s>
it is it is a lot of fun though i mean what is really cool about it is you are attending class with people from all over the country sometimes all over the world um you get like real life experience that you can like take to the office the very next day and uh the other really cool thing about is the networking possibilities like i met um some good people from hp through that </s>
oh yeah </s>
um the other thing is is um my friend also is ah doing it on-line and uh she got chosen for a uh a focus group where they actually sent her down to new orleans </s>
hmm </s>
for a weekend totally paid um just to talk to her about the on-line experience an and give her thoughts and comments about it </s>
fascinating th th </s>
cough yeah </s>
that looks like it is a really worthwhile thing to do and i am glad it has progressed this far because i i remember hearing early on in the on-line uh education world a few years ago that it jus i it was very difficult but so </s>
well i think the credibility was a big issue too i mean like </s>
mhm </s>
how credible are these are these colleges that are offering on-line you know degrees is it really worth something </s>
right </s>
and um you know the reason that i focused in on the university of phoenix was because it was a big name </s>
mhm </s>
um the only drawback there also is it is extremely expensive it is about twelve hundred bucks a class </s>
right </s>
and um right now the company i am with uh eh they do not offer tuition assistance so </s>
yeah th well you know y you brought some very valid points about trying to choose college how to do it what to do um trying if if you are going to go to a traditional college you need to try and figure out as quickly as possible what track you are going to take because if you spin your wheels too much you are just you are you are gone you are wasting your parents money and </s>
breath oh yeah think about it it is a lot of pressure too for a kid i mean </s>
and that is that mhm absolutely </s>
i remember when i was in high school it was it was a lot of pressure because for awhile i was thinking about college and </s>
um ghosts and ghost items and all this weird stuff and every every year around halloween time </s>
mhm </s>
they put on seminars breath at the local high schools an and things like that they are very ah they are very famous apparently but breath i never really heard of them until we came to connecticut </s>
mhm </s>
and um </s>
oh wow </s>
it supposedly it is a very real thing and i have you know the um their neighbors who a-are friends of mine from college </s>
mhm </s>
said that they have been to the house and seen all these you know their little ghost museum i am afraid to go over there i do not know what to expect </s>
breath no i i believe in ghosts i definitely like there is too many for instances </s>
mhm </s>
that you know have i mean maybe not very proven but i mean are all these people making it up you know there is so many been so many sightings </s>
yeah </s>
that kind of thing i i i believe it </s>
sort of like ufo's </s>
i think it is yeah i eh </s>
think you believe in that too </s>
yeah like not i do not think everybody can be making that up eh it is just it just does not seem like something that people you know are making up especially ghosts like breath i have been in houses where you just get that creepy feeling </s>
mhm </s>
and it is like you are hearing these noises but breath then again you know you know someone died there so it is either you imagina- your imagination is playing a big trick on you there is something breath </s>
wha what state are you calling from </s>
so pennsylvania </s>
pennsylvania breath there is i i am originally from massachusetts </s>
mhm </s>
and i never had any kind of experience or anything you know i i never even had an opinion of ghosts until we came to this part of connecticut </s>
really breath </s>
there is supposedly this haunted um cemetery right in my town </s>
mhm </s>
and every year there is something in the newspaper where somebody drives off the road because they saw breath some apparition standing in the road </s>
right </s>
and </s>
yeah like things like that you know it is just are they all making it up laugh </s>
i do not know i i think it has it has happened too many times in this particular place </s>
mhm </s>
that i you know it is too much for coincidence </s>
yeah i definitely agree and especially breath i do not know if you ever noticed there is always breath some something happens in those those specific haunted houses </s>
mhm </s>
like y you know the ones you see on tv all the time the a and e specials laugh breath um there is something that happens too much you know bad things in the same place </s>
yeah </s>
and you know in an abandoned house there is no way you can get it you know no way that someone would have gotten in to do something </s>
i it is way too much for coincidence </s>
and yeah that is what i think especially in um savannah georgia </s>
mhm </s>
i mean they are not s supposedly they are not like bad ghosts you know if you want to call it that laugh the evil ones but people say when they s- you know sleep down there is a lot of slaves and you know ghosts of you know ghosts of slaves </s>
yeah </s>
and little children who who died you know during </s>
and they have and they have pictures of of like people that are it seems like a ghost of a child or something standing behind </s>
mhm </s>
curtain or something like that </s>

um but i used to i grew up in roxborough which is like a sub suburb of philly </s>
yeah yeah </s>
and there was in roxborough there was two libraries which i thought </s>
yeah </s>
i think that is plenty </s>
yeah philadelphia has an awesome library that is that is an awesome building but this one here it is kind of small really inadequate uh computers for they have kids programs breath so it is cool for the kids but i do not think i think libraries are going to be um a thing of the past the way the internet is going </s>
yeah that is true </s>
because i mean you can jus- you do not even have to take a book out you can just read over the comp cough </s>
yeah that is i do not know like the only i just graduated from college too and um </s>

breath laugh you are what shift are you </s>
but ah yeah ah right now three to midnight </s>
alright well okay </s>
ah it is okay i have worked second shift before so it is not bad </s>
right </s>
but ah i guess we are supposed to be talking about libraries though right </s>
yeah i think so laugh </s>
laugh breath but um as far as libraries are concerned i think i think there is it is it is pretty at least pretty decent around around my area we have a lot of small community libraries </s>
right </s>
and ah funding is really tough for the the little towns because they basically have to kind of get most of it on their own </s>
right </s>
so i i think that for uh at least what i have seen they do a pretty good job with what they with what they have got </s>
what what what they have got yeah i wonder it it it is completely with all private funding i guess nothing goes into that from any of the ah town taxes </s>
ah none from none from the town i mean they do get some like i think the town may give like like a donation or something something like that </s>
right right </s>
um at least in my town the ah the town used to own it but ah a library association was formed because the the town just kind of wanted to get out of that </s>
right right </s>
you know sti and like just stick to business type stuff so </s>
yeah </s>
you know they do a lot of fund raisers and things and ah you know it is it is not bad um where i think it kind of tough is in a lot of your rural areas </s>
right yeah </s>
you know i mean where like where where i went to college i mean we had a library science program where i went to college a and that was really good they had the people in the town could use the university library but out and about ah this was up in ah northwestern pennsylvania a lot of really really small towns </s>
okay right right </s>
i mean just no library facilities for these people at all </s>
that is terrible </s>
you know and it is you know it is it is tough </s>
i think it is probably a little bit easier on them now </s>
 </s>
because ah breath ah ah of from the internet i mean there is so much available information out there now people are able to get at home </s>
oh </s>
they do not necessarily have to have to go to the library as much anymore </s>
oh that is a you are right you are right i i do think that is a big that is a big plus ah even people that have library facilities </s>
right </s>
i mean you know quite often you you could not find what you want weather the library was busy or the books were out or you know whatever </s>
exactly </s>
well you know it gives you other options </s>
exactly breath right you know i have no i have not been into my own ah town library and i i have actually just moved recently in over a year </s>
hm </s>
um but i do not think that they were um up to par at all with their compu the computers and things like that i think that was you know that they were still lacking on that and i can not imagine within a year and a half that that that they sh they have not done something because it is just it is a necessity breath at this point </s>
right sure is it sure is mean like i said a lot of it is the funding i mean my my home town library i mean they just got hooked up to the internet and got two computers you know and scanners and everything </s>
right right </s>
just within just within the last year year and a half </s>
right </s>
and it it is it is it is all money </s>
but think about the amount of people that want to use those you know people who do not have a computer at home </s>
you are yeah </s>
i mean we are lucky enough to be able to you know use a computer through work but breath you do not have that and you do not have one at home you are kind of you are at a loss </s>
right i me i remember i mean i just recently got the internet i mean not recently but i i would say within the last two and a half years </s>
right right right </s>
and before that i kept hearing everybody all world wide web this world wide web that i am like jesus </s>
right you are like what the hell what does it all mean what is it how right </s>
yeah really i was i was i was being left behind </s>
and how could you have so much information and you wonder like can there really be so much information out there now you know that basically anything and everything you could think of is there </s>
but that is that is correct but in in some ways it does make libraries kind of seem ah obsolete in a way </s>
right right which is sad laugh breath </s>
it it it is i mean a library is a good place i mean i i i like libraries i like going there i like just sit sitting you know just i will pull a book off the shelf and just read and relax </s>
i do too right breath right i mean i ah in t terms of personal like reading i would you know i mean depending on how what time of year it is summertime i will find myself reading a lot and to go out and purchase books so like i have my father goes to the library three times a week ah minimum three times a week because he reads that often </s>
ah that is good </s>
you know book after book after book after book so you know why go why go buy the best seller </s>
sure sure </s>
at at you know at barnes and noble when you can just go to the library and get it and return it in three days </s>
i n absolutely i know i go in spurts though sometimes </s>
me too </s>
with with going to the library sometimes i will be i will be going week after week after week and </s>
right </s>
you know now i mean i have just recently moved so i mean i i have not shown my face in the library in about four months and </s>
right laugh right right </s>
no ju just kind of feel like i have not been settled or anything but </s>
right </s>
at least everywhere i have been there have always been library facilities and you know i do appreciate that i just you know wish funding would just be more so they would be better equipped </s>
right yeah right i mean and even for the ah younger kids the schools i mean they are the libraries at the probably like the elementary school levels or even possibly junior high are not you know as accessible or i do not think that they are stocked as as well as like a high school library of course </s>
you are you are exac exactly correct </s>
so they so they rely on these public libraries for all these reports and whatever the hell they are doing ah unless of course now they have got </s>
oh yeah i used i used to be a teacher and i used to sent my kids to the library all the time </s>
right </s>
i i i i i made i made and absolute um necessity of some of their assignments that they had to go to the library </s>
right </s>
true </s>
i also think that um breath if a person is doing their job well </s>
yes </s>
and is not affected at all on his job and if he does drink off ke off work or does drugs away from work that's none of my business </s>
breath true oh i don't think they are talking about that i think you know if they come in </s>
mhm </s>
i think if they come in you know </s>

right </s>
cough </s>
oh definitely collectibles </s>

mhm </s>
i'm a uh toy collector myself breath </s>
oh yeah </s>
yeah i just went to a toy show on sunday out in leesport near reading </s>
for what oh yeah i know where that is </s>
and uh some of the stuff i had when i was little was killing me </s>

mhm </s>

laugh i took it apart breath mom threw it away </s>
so specifically i collect little hotwheels and the matchbox cars right now but </s>
oh yeah </s>
yeah </s>
i've got some action figures some old ones that i put away breath i bought when uh when i was younger my mom has always been a doll collector so she took some of that stuff and put it away for me when i was younger </s>
well it's good though at least it's away </s>
yeah </s>
so but yeah i still have the cars from when i was little but you look at them and it looks like i did hit them with a hammer </s>
laugh </s>
they're not quite in the shape they should be </s>
yeah having the fun of having those cars </s>
that's the whole thing and now you look at and the collectors are actually buying them that never let their kids play with them </s>
)) mhm </s>
and i don't have any kids so i'm buying them and i open most of them just for display but </s>
yeah </s>
i started off collecting just the jeeps breath </s>
oh </s>
cause i own a jeep </s>
mhm </s>
so and then i got a little hay wire from there </s>
i hate wire breath i don't know i haven't i haven't put tha gotten any of that stuff recently because uh i know it's breath breath it hasn't appealed to me recently so you know </s>
yeah yeah have you priced out what you own now </s>
uh only one or two things like the obvious big uh the obvious of of the larger larger ones that i have uh remember those those uh super powers action figures the ones that you got to squeeze their legs and they did something </s>
oh yeah </s>
like they'd punch or kick or something breath </s>
yeah </s>
i have a bunch of those i have a batman in the box worth like eighty dollars so i'm kind of good with that one </s>
wow </s>
cough </s>
huh you should go on to uh online and check out ebay </s>
yeah i that really sounds like a disaster waiting to happen i mean nobody says it's good but you don't meet those people you don't know who they are </s>
no i've actually sold stuff on there and i've bought stuff on there </s>
mhm </s>
and i have not had a problem yet and the one guy had a problem with he shipped me something that was totally opposite of what he said it was </s>
yeah </s>
and i emailed him and he said no problem send it back he i'll send you the check first with the money to ship it back to me </s>
mhm </s>
because if they get one bad comment </s>
yeah </s>
they're screwed </s>
as they're done /as </s>
basically i mean they're shot so </s>
i don't know i've seen that stuff and it seems like a hassle i mean i could be wrong but </s>
it's not too bad i mean i don't buy too much stuff off of it but it's a good way to figure out what your stuff is worth </s>
mhm </s>
like if you search action figures </s>
mhm </s>
and you specifically put yours it will do a search of everything ever sold on ebay </s>
mhm </s>
and you'll see what they sold for </s>
okay </s>
and it will give you an idea of just what it's worth you don't have to buy anything or sell anything you can just do a search on it and you type in the item you're looking for </s>
mhm </s>
you know star wars figures or whatever so how long you've been with omnipoint now </s>
i don't remem </s>

oh okay my name is jason by the way </s>
hi i am my name is jan </s>
do you work for omnipoint </s>
yeah </s>
do you so i guess we got to discuss a topic here </s>
yeah breath </s>
minimum wage um i personally feel that m uh you can not uh determine minimum wage per region because obviously if you work in new york your um minimum wage is going to be different than if you live uh </s>
 </s>
in amish country pennsylvania </s>
right </s>
or therefore it should be </s>
that is right breath breath because you can affo breath just like eh down south it is cheaper to live in you know in woods than it is you know yeah new york city and stuff so it does make sense breath that it should b it should vary from state to state </s>
are you from new york city </s>
no </s>
are you uh </s>
uh </s>
where exactly do you work for omnipoint </s>
bethlehem </s>
oh do you alright so do i </s>
mhm oh yeah breath </s>
lipsmack um but uh obviously as th u your standard eh or the standards of living increase uh with uh uh with uh inflation and all that obviously naturally eh minimum wage is going to have to increase </s>
yeah breath yeah and definitely breath and um breath the thing that i said about um it sh if it should increase in d in different states i think that is a good thing because like we said before bu breath i do not even think five twenty five is enough well not nowadays </s>
mhm not if breath not with a family absolutely not oh i agree n not with a family obviously rent or rent alone you five six hundred dollars a month for a one bedroom apartment yeah five twenty five an hour just does not cut it </s>
that is right laugh breath but it is a lot better then when i started when i started the minimum wage was three twenty five </s>
lipsmack breath cough oh i use i started i think at four twenty five so still but then again uh the cost of living was cheaper </s>
yeah oh yeah that is that is about it everything goes up but your wages </s>
i mean new cars these days are twenty thousand dollars you are lucky to find a decent car under ten thousand dollars </s>
sh your lucky if you can find a decent one at twenty thousand laugh </s>
it is ridiculous </s>
laugh i know it is i mean n th the house that i am living in when it when it was brand new it was twenty one thousand you cant find a decent car for that </s>
no </s>
so </s>
and then mortgages these days i mean if you find a home for under a hundred thousand that is somewhat decent i mean it is it is it is outrageous </s>
oh yeah that is for sure but that keeps going up and we just come up as quick for some reason </s>
no </s>
i do not know why breath </s>
but even if you do not make minimum wage you are still not making enough i know ours </s>
yeah </s>
so we not exa we are making more than mini minimum wage but our salaries don't increase with the minimum wage they should </s>
no no breath eh i know it should breath ah minimum wage goes up every here breath and um every three years breath but now th it is going up in january we should get a raise too but only people at minimum wage as samson /as my cat just got outside laugh and i got chased oh they are both out breath ah d i is this this your first time with phone calls </s>

uh hispanics as well as uh koreans so maybe eh maybe we have to start thinking about taking on ah i guess what the korea dialect whatever they speak you know lipsmack because we're dealing like you know they're in our our community a lot now a days in our world asians and they don't </s>
yeah </s>
breath they're not ah they also talk asians still talk uh i'm not trying to say funny but they don't talk as clear english breath as good english as we would speak they don't speak as good english as we may speak but ah yeah i think its it couldn't hurt you you know to learn another language </s>
yeah i am i am not sure that i would m make it a requirement but uh </s>
requirement right </s>
def definitely would ah benefit somebody if they spoke another language i am sure of that </s>
oh yeah bilingual definite </s>
of course i say that not being able to speak another language fluently i have ah some german but that is that is way back laugh a long time ago when i went to high school </s>
i don't think it should be a requirement i mean i think english should be still the number one language that we should speak in business and in business in our communities that we should speak english but i like you know not a requirement i think we you know i think people really it is other nationalities just don't want to learn en- they just don't want to use english </s>
yeah </s>
laugh </s>
i i think we found you know that that is more of the case than americans not being willing to learn laugh other languages </s>
right </s>
all the people coming here do not want to speak english but </s>
exactly they would rather just stick with what they know </s>
yeah </s>
 </s>
i know that is a cultural thing with a lot of people but you know ah i do not see how you can get by without being able to speak english </s>
exactly in this world </s>
a a lot of times i don't know how you get away with ah not being able to read it either so </s>
imagine that right laugh </s>
laugh </s>
people somewhere in the world don't how to speak english </s>
yeah </s>
and it is the dominant language you know i guess in business see if they know how to read language read english </s>

over the last two years there is only i think it is something like forty three percent of stocks are up and fifty seven percent are down from january first </s>
oh really huh </s>
so it is not like everyone you just throw your money in you make money </s>

right they just right wow yeah that is true </s>
pharmaceuticals financials um </s>
yeah they just look at the high techs </s>

uh-huh </s>
so that kind of stuff was used down there all the time breath </s>
ew huh </s>
but it's just breath i think breath that it should be a personal a person's personal choice </s>
yeah definitely definitely </s>
)) you know i </s>
lipsmack and i think work stresses too much about it too like about drugs and the whole nine everything about it being illegal so they want to drug test you i mean i could see if you're coming to work high or something or drunk that's a different story but if you're doing it on your on personal time you know what i mean and if you're doing something illegal if you're going to be that stupid to do it out in public and drive a car and get caught then that's your own problem </s>
yeah like alcohol </s>
but yeah exactly </s>
it should be regulated like alcohol </s>
yup </s>
oh they do no minors and if you get caught under the influence breath then you're in trouble driving </s>
yeah exactly </s>
you know what i mean breath and i don't think that it should ever affect someone's ability to work breath because the big deal jayce is you know breath when someone is like using that stuff there's people who breath can normally function in life and do things and stuff like that cough if you have someone whose slacking and screwing up and taking off from work breath then you know use that as a way to modify their behavior you know </s>
cough right </s>
do a drug test and nail them that way breath </s>
yup </s>
but don't strictly go by someone who comes to work everyday cause i remember breath </s>
cough </s>

mhm yup laugh </s>
you know and all of them were good and they were really good employers and they got whacked breath because of that and ah it's just so unfair breath i didn't </s>
yup </s>
think it affected their performance at all and it's none of the companies business what happens breath outside of work yup </s>

uh uh </s>
that's freaky because you know i i just i think it just sucks you know what i mean i don't mind getting tested cause breath i'm not stupid enough to compromise my job over it i know it's a big no no here but breath </s>
right yeah </s>
i think that i would have more propensity to party on the weekends breath if i didn't have that thing hanging over my head </s>
right exactly </s>
you know </s>

right breath </s>
you know and they still illegalize it i think it's a lot of um breath government wanting to figure out a way breath to be able to make money off of it </s>
yeah </s>
i think that it has nothing to do breath with you know whether it's legal or not because look what they did with cigarettes </s>

no thankfully i actually at one point worked with happy fernandez </s>
mhm laugh oh did you </s>
yeah you have any children </s>
i have one ah she is a dau my daughter is ah seventeen she just turned seventeen now </s>
oh okay so breath those sixteen seventeen they need to be educated really breath but i i really i number one it is our job </s>
i believe so too </s>
so you know it is uh whether the school does it or not it should begin at home you know so whether the school do or not it does not make a difference to me because my </s>
absolutely </s>
kids breath are educated and they been educated since small breath you know because i always talk to them breath you know to talk to them to you know let them know if anybody touch them in a way breath that they should not be touched you know that they should tell me you know so i have started that since my kids was little </s>
and i think that is so important i agree a hundred percent breath i think that it is the parents responsibility to um teach their children about sex breath um i do not i really do not feel that it is breath a school requirement i think that it should come from the parents breath though i do know </s>
no me either but for the yeah but for the kids who parents do not do what they supposed to do </s>
breath well see that is it and i do know that there are some parents that are uncomfortable talking to their children which is a shame but i know that breath </s>
or some of them that are too busy or too into other things yeah just some parents are on drugs you know right </s>
or who just do not care you know unfortunately there is a lot of there is a lot out there like that breath um you know i am i am very fortunate in that i have a very open relationship with my daughter </s>
i do too laugh </s>
lipsmack and i i feel very lucky about that she comes to me she tells me things that breath it amazes me sometimes the things that she tells me </s>
i know but you be so glad that they feel you know trust you enough to be able to come to you i tell my daughter y and my son you can talk </s>
oh absolutely </s>
to me about anything i do not care what it is i do not care breath if you think it is embarrassing i do not care what it is you come to me with it </s>
it and that is so important and you know breath um lipsmack so some children they just um they feel uncomfortable talking to their parents about it or breath you know and and some parents have a closed mind it is really important to keep an open mind because breath the situation today is different from </s>
right when we were younger really you do not sound it laugh breath you sound like a young lady you are you are still young but i mean you sound younger than fifty </s>
breath i am i am fifty years old breath and and laugh the the aw thank you but but you know when when i was growing up the situation was so totally different than today breath and that is why you have to keep an open mind you have to be receptive to what society is today breath when you talk to your children because if you breath try to approach them based on what it was back when i was yo it is so totally different </s>
wow cough it is so amazing you sound just like me you know cause like once the kids start having sex just because you say do not have sex it is bad you should wait until you get married breath you could catch a disease all that stuff you could say all of that all you want to once they start having it just because you said do not do it does not mean they are not going to do it breath you just educate them breath teach them safe sex </s>
is not that the truth that is right </s>
you know make sure that they do know about safe sex and they do know about diseases you know that you make sure they know everything that they supposed to know because once they getting ready to do there is nothing you me nobody can do to stop them </s>
oh y you are so right and no matter breath you know no matter what what you want your children to do that does not mean that that is what they are going to do it laugh breath so that is you are absolutely right </s>
that is right you plant the seed when they are young you plant the seed when they are young and then l later on in life they will use it they will think about it oh my mom taught me this you know that is the only way i know because this is what my parents taught me </s>
you are absolutely that is that is right that is right and breath you know if if every parent felt the way you did we would not have half the problems we do today laugh </s>
so ho yeah it would be so good because breath the kids feel really pressure and they get into a lot of stuff because they do not have nobody to understand them </s>
oh that is so true </s>
and they do not have nobody that they could go to and honestly openly talk to breath so they get into so many different things </s>
oh that i so true and you know and and so many of the children they do not feel comfortable talking to their parents so they talk to their friends in school breath and they are getting really you know they are not getting the right information of course you know and and that leads to a lot of problems breath but i know my daughter she she like i said we have a very open relationship she </s>
mhm nope </s>
talks to me and she tells me almost everything breath and she says to me she says to me you know mom breath yo none of my friends talk to their mothers like </s>

right </s>
you've still found other you know you although you had a career for so long you still have so many things in your life that that you enjoy that you want to do and </s>

right </s>
carrying out your your day to day life on all through that and then continuing to appreciate it that's breath </s>
yeah right </s>
i think that's pretty great thing </s>
oh yeah yeah just uh waking up in the morning could be laugh an accomplishment too laugh </s>

uh-huh </s>
breath i when i came to new york i came to study music and um </s>

it is it is a um she does everything um she can handle your account um she can fix your account she can tell you anything about your phone she can do anything basically anything </s>
mhm otherwise she would not work in the company long </s>

centers and actual places where you can go and work for the company </s>
mhm mhm </s>
there is one in i do not know if you are familiar with allentown pennsylvania okay breath there is one near in allentown there is in there is two down south i think one in atlanta somewhere that they are just opening up and there is another one down in florida there is only three but </s>
um but la i did like it you know far as like i do not know it is i mean it is it is a city i mean it is r it is a urban city you know so i cannot say i do not know maybe because i am from s city you know philadelphia is a large city </s>
yeah exactly i was originally born here myself </s>
so that is </s>
so i know what you mean </s>
right </s>
um i have another question have you been to new york </s>
yeah </s>
okay </s>
s s several times </s>
now how would you how would you compare the two uh l la and new york </s>
once uh well then again i like the east coast see i am from the east coast see </s>
ah okay </s>
it it is a big difference between east and west </s>
definitely </s>
believe me it is a real big difference the lifestyles the attitudes and you know people on the west coast right it is like i am not going to say more laid back it is i i would say like southern california especially has got more of uh exactly what it is southern you know it has more it is like different accents </s>
yeah </s>
different lifestyles you know and ah you can see a big difference in it you know the way people care theyself the mannerisms and things like that </s>
and yeah that is that is what i have i have been able to gather from uh my various friends too </s>
you know </s>
but i think i do not necessarily like that way of life </s>
right </s>
plus i think i mean i do not want to generalize but from what i have heard from them they all seem to say about the same thing and it is like eight or nine people </s>
al right </s>
and um i i think from some of the logistical considerations like they do not have a good metro system the downtown is kind of dead after hours </s>
yeah </s>
i guess and </s>
right </s>
i mean in philly downtown you know the areas are pretty kicking and go shopping and restaurants </s>
right </s>
and in la from what i i guess what i gather is it is not that the downtown is not like that at all right </s>
right right i mean it is like far as you know the commuting that is a big thing i feel i think a big hang up for it the commute because like i said they do not have uh uh their public transportation system right </s>
yeah </s>
they have do not have like philadelphia has the underground and they have the elevated trains s subway service car where la they just like i said </s>
right </s>
they do not have it they have buses and everything is like their freeways is like congested with motor vehicles you know all they have is cars cars cars </s>
yeah yeah </s>
and i think that makes a difference on the um the metropolis as a whole you know like far as you know the way it is like you know traveling congestion and people and then it it affects the mood and the a the attitude of people </s>
yeah that definitely makes sense </s>
i think it plays a big part yeah </s>
yeah i mean that that makes sense i mean i guess though uh have you ever been to anywhere in the carribean </s>
no i have not </s>
okay i i maybe i will talk a little more on the islands then i mean i have been to quite a few islands in the carribean um </s>
uh right </s>
for various vacations and breath it would be difficult to really choose between bora bora and la i would imagine i would probably also choose bora bora actually </s>
right </s>
um just because i la l what la is is larger than philly of course philly is like the fourth largest city la is uh like number two i think </s>
yeah </s>
and chicago is three and new york of course is one breath </s>
no yeah </s>
but it it seems like uh now from what i have read about it and my friend's experiences and everything it seems like it it is not the kind of lifestyle that i would identify more with now i do not know if i would ident </s>
hello </s>
there hello </s>
oh okay </s>
okay i think i might be able to adapt to uh bora bora better </s>
alright </s>
um just because i i i have seen a variety of i islands that i just i love that climate i love uh i mean it depends uh bora bora is not completely isolated either </s>
right </s>
so you know i i wha who do you think i mean maybe since you have never been to one if it is just breath like reading or or television or discovery but </s>
right that is the only thing right that is the only picture you know that i have of you know the islands and itself right breath </s>
yeah </s>
you know from what i have seen on television read novels and books and things of that nature so </s>
right </s>
you know but from what i eh i mean it looks fascinating you know it looks like something i would enjoy you know be on like a tropical island tropical climate to what not you know breath sands beaches and just like even the tropical the jungle part of it breath you know but um </s>
okay alright now how about the question of long term though i wonder if we are both fooling ourselves do you think we would get tired of that after a long time </s>
well </s>
knowing that that we could never leave for example </s>
oh see now that is the thing right when that is right we are going to be there i mean but then again would you like to be stuck in well i cannot say that because i am here now and </s>
laugh </s>
it is like i cannot leave so i mean breath i can leave but you know it is like wow but i mean breath as a permanent residence where where it is like no other place then </s>
yeah </s>
i do not know i think i could </s>
yeah </s>
i mean if it changed from now yeah i say that now though right you know </s>
yeah yeah </s>
and when i get there that is a hard that is a tough you know tough decision but um i do not know i i would it would be like i said i would give it a try i would like to give it a try and then if i be stuck with it then laugh breath well </s>
laugh yeah that is the problem we might not be able to get off </s>
yeah </s>
i i would </s>
right </s>
you know i think it is a safety i am going to go the other way i would have to pick la because </s>
yeah </s>
despite the fact of how much i i love the carribean islands like that i also realize that on a variety of islands where i have been breath it is difficult to get things and i mean unless bora bora </s>
right </s>
is going to become the idealized community where everything is going to be shipped to me which is not the case you know </s>
right laugh breath </s>
so i mean i i think i would miss i mean i i love new york i love philly i mean i and i like boston a lot i love pittsburgh i would miss the ability to just go out the door </s>
ah wha e what else can i say </s>
huh why do you believe that the they deserve a higher salary </s>
ah cause they cause they make a lot of money for people they make a lot of money it's all business laugh </s>
uh okay </s>
are you in a car too </s>
no actually i me myself i am walking </s>
oh really </s>
yeah </s>
breath where where you walking at philadelphia or </s>
yeah i'm in philadelphia </s>
lipsmack uh-huh lipsmack </s>

breath uh-huh </s>
but um i don't i think they can they deserve it to make a little bit more money than what they are making also </s>
right </s>
because you know without them things would be totally different </s>
right </s>
and at least that's could show at least appreciation because they they bring enough joy into people's life </s>

mhm </s>
because you are so far up in the you know in the air </s>
mhm </s>

 </s>

mhm </s>
and her family lived over there so that is why we went over there we stood there for like about a week or two weeks </s>
 </s>
yeah it was really nice beautiful beautiful </s>
eh exotic places that bad laugh laugh um new jersey does not count i i do not know i have not really left um i did a little bit of traveling in the west </s>
in the west </s>
um when i was in high school </s>
yeah i have never seen it i have never done anything like that </s>
you know choosing the right school to go to </s>
yeah but just um okay em you have been through the process and i have been through the process by sending one </s>
breath well i am i am about to go through the process again because unfortunately </s>
laugh ah okay what is your major </s>
breath lipsmack uh i am a marketing major lipsmack yeah </s>
marketing so uh as a transfer student you should be able to get into the college of your choice </s>
breath um yeah i am trying to get my gpa raise that up a little bit before i transfer to make sure i can get a scholarship you know that is definitely a factor you want to look into when you are transferring you do not want to have that you know big debt hanging over your head have to take out loans </s>
uh-huh breath laugh </s>
breath cause i </s>
alright well breath i think we are supposed to lipsmack at least discuss you know uh the process that breath that i guess you would advise your child even though you know laugh breath you you are going </s>
mhm breath well actually what i would advise my child to do is to like first of all is to apply to a lot of schools breath not just one or two because when you apply to more than one then you know you have a lot more options you know apply to some close at home some far away some private institutions some public institutions breath to vary it up you know that way when you you know when you get your packages back and you are looking at the information that the colleges are offering breath you you have more of a choice and a selection and you can actually sit down and say okay no i do not want to go to this one uh you know and that way you can sit down and have some choices and options </s>
well i that is that is definitely something that you should do um however if you are looking for specific colleges </s>
that is just mhm lipsmack yeah </s>
or you know uh or certain s you know fields of study or people that are you s know colleges that are supposed to be very good you know for engineering or for business </s>
lipsmack right but see the lipsmack mhm </s>
you have to you have to just apply it to those also you know you you cannot </s>
breath yes cough oh right yeah i think he should apply to many different schools but see the thing is breath y what do you really know when you are coming right out of the twelfth grade yeah you say you want to be an engineer but you know if you get stuck in a school that is just for engineering breath and you decide that is not for you then you are going to have a really difficult time </s>
that </s>
you know transferring to another school or switching your major and things like that </s>
breath that is true yeah i agree with that um my son happened to um want to be an an engineering major </s>
mhm </s>
and he started out in cornell and right and then he decided he wanted to go to virginia </s>
cornell mhm lipsmack virginia tech </s>
no the university of virginia laugh breath </s>
oh okay </s>
and the only way somebody from new jersey can get into that college is by transferring </s>
right mhm </s>
you know and he was just very lucky to transfer because they do not i think they accept maybe a hundred people a year you know it is very diffi very difficult to get in from out of state </s>
that are mhm </s>
so you know breath if you are stuck with a major and he actually changed he switched from engineering to laugh economics laugh breath while while while he was there breath you know </s>
really see breath m yeah see that is what i mean it is like you know you do not want to get uh stuck in school in a school that only specializes in one thing </s>
yeah exactly </s>
so that way you can easily switch majors without having to switch schools which is good </s>
breath </s>
because a lot of times when you are switching schools you lose a lot of your credits sometimes </s>
ah yeah you have to check that way ahead of time you know </s>
yeah yeah uh-huh </s>
even even if you have taken courses in high school that you think you are going to get college credits for them a lot of the schools will not accept them </s>
yeah they sure will not </s>
yeah you you should check that before you even apply to the school you know </s>
mhm but um and like also when you are applying you know a lot of people say you know i think i would advise my child to at least take the sats two or three times </s>
breath oh absolutely absolutely i think what are you starting tenth grade taking them </s>
and uh breath breath i think in the tenth grade you take the psats the preparatory sat test and then like in the eleventh grade that is when you would take the actual sat and take it two or three times </s>
yeah yeah that that is a plus breath although they claim they do not use that as any weight but i think that is a lot of bologna </s>
yeah breath lipsmack um i do not think well ac some schools actually have a minimum if you do not have a certain percent on your sat score they do not even admit you </s>
huh </s>
because i know nyu the ah minimum is i think about eleven hundred </s>
yeah and it </s>
and ah and also even if they do not use that as criteria to get into their school they do use that as criteria for awarding scholarships </s>
uh-huh </s>
breath they had some kind of benefit for the red cross that they donated money breath for um all the flood victims and stuff like that they do that every year </s>
oh that is nice </s>
yeah so breath um eventually hopefully i will get that union job laugh yeah how about yourself </s>
mhm um when i worked over the summer with my dad i worked at like um breath an electrical plant so i was part of the union there even though i was only </s>
right lipsmack oh okay well how was that breath </s>
it was it was fun i mean it really did not have that much of an effect on me breath i still had to pay union dues but </s>
right no okay breath now now is your dad ac um um active real strong in the union </s>
so like yeah he was president of the union so </s>
oh great great great breath that's good now do they do um lipsmack different fundraisers or um </s>
yeah yeah oh yeah yeah </s>
eh okay they always breath do they have a big turnout on meetings and stuff like that </s>
um usually like they have uh like company meetings when it is just the people who at that particular plantco and then they have like breath like world like um state wide and then they have like united states wide like my dad goes to all these different meetings all the time </s>
oh okay right oh okay because i do i do i feel as though unions they do help the employees who you know breath only because they um </s>
yeah mhm </s>
prime example i know um certain people breath like uh say for example someone does not get along with their boss and you know they don't see </s>
uh-huh </s>
no kind of nobody sees no uh no resolve in the situation then you can always go to the union if it gets really crucial </s>
mhm </s>
you know where as the person like me breath if i have a problem with my supervisor then i will go to our boss breath then it might not be the same outcome you know i just might be fired when if i had a union i'll have somebody come in and represent me and my job might be saved </s>
mhm yeah and don't unions help in like when it is lay-offs and stuff if you are part of a union </s>
you know ri exactly yeah </s>
yeah breath no i don't think i will be able to be a part of a union in my major because um </s>
no okay what is your major </s>
accounting </s>
oh okay okay </s>
so breath yeah i don't think i will be part i don't know i don't know if they have unions i guess it depends on where i work </s>
hm right uh yeah that's that's true it all depends with company or something that you are with um lipsmack might have a union then most then most </s>
mhm </s>
accountants they really don't like you said so most likely you probably you will never be never be part of a union </s>
yeah yeah </s>
it but then again union has its pros and cons it's good but then again it's bad breath because more more smaller business um </s>
yeah </s>
breath they seem to be pretty much okay which i work for liberty mutual breath insurance company and um </s>
mhm </s>
they're pretty big company but they seem to do okay without a union you know cough </s>
yeah breath because like if unions go on strike you are part of that whether or not you want to be </s>
uh yeah exactly see like my sister-in-law she is part of a union for bell telephone and breath like when they go on strike </s>
mhm </s>
it's hard crossing that picket line you know and when she has a daughter she pays for her daughter's catholic school and stuff like that um </s>
yeah yeah </s>
lipsmack i it's kind of it's kind of hard you have to bite the bullet either you know you don't want to cross the picket line but </s>
mhm </s>
you know you do but you don't and it puts people in different situations because regardless you still have bills and everything to be paid </s>
yeah yeah yeah </s>
car notes and mortgages so it is kind of crucial i do admit that part you know </s>
breath yeah i think i would have to like breath so i don't i don't you are not forced to be in the union if you work at a certain place right it is totally up to you </s>
lipsmack breath no no because wh years ago i use to work for ups i was part of the union but i had an option not to be in the union breath but i </s>
yeah i worked for ups and i had the option to so </s>
yeah and i chose to be in the union it was okay i did it for a little while breath um i did not stick with ups long </s>
mhm yeah </s>
because i was working three jobs because my other jobs breath now i worked i was working at that time i was working at um </s>
yeah </s>
breath lerner's a women clothes store and they were union i was kind of surprised they were unionized </s>
mhm are they really i did not know that </s>
yeah lerner's matter of fact they were af affiliated with uh shop in bag employees they have a union i think they were all involved in the same union </s>
hm </s>
yeah it was kind of weird i never knew a a a retail store whe be union </s>
yeah because i use to work for express and i don't remember hearing anything about </s>
no okay breath yeah lerner's use to be union </s>
no </s>
yeah that was a uh that was i don't know and their union did not seem to be too active because we never did get any kind of like letters in the mail like little newsletters we did not get none of that stuff you know like regular unions do they didn't </s>
uh-huh yeah </s>
so they were not too active at least not whe in in our area they weren't active at all you know um </s>
uh-huh yeah </s>
we had a older lady there breath she was like head of the union but miss miss uh uh um lipsmack miss betty but she was like so up in age she wasn't really strong with it or keeping up to par with it so it was like </s>
yeah </s>
you know you g you taking union dues out and you are really not using the union and they are not sending you no like newsletters or anything like that </s>
so you never know what is going on yeah </s>
of that nature yeah exactly so breath it was you know that was my experience with the union with um lerners and um ups </s>
yeah i think i would have to like investigate like the union itself before i joined it because if it had like a high percentage of being on strike and stuff like that i would not want to chance it </s>
mhm yeah d exactly exactly </s>
oh really well that is a plus laugh </s>
oh you are </s>
yeah mhm </s>

uh i think there is too many bars in pennsylvania laugh breath that would never no one would go there because most of the people i mean like i know myself i am more of a social smoker breath </s>
yeah breath mhm right </s>
so um like i i i can go the whole entire day and not smoke one cigarette breath and then as soon as i get a beer in my hand i have to smoke and i know a lot of people that are like that where it is more of a social setting </s>
mhm right </s>
so i think it will be kind of hard for ah a lot of public places to try and ban smoking you know breath due to i do not know i figure if you do not like me i do not like the way i smell when i come home either but i do not know exactly </s>
mhm right you take a shower breath i mean my house does not smell like smoke you know i do not i do not think i smell like smoke my my fiance is a non-smoker and he never complains so breath i think that is a pretty good indication that i do not probably do not smoke that much </s>
right right </s>
you know but if if i am out and you know or after a meal i want to have a cigarette or if i am on a long car ride i want to smoke you know </s>
right and i i actually i see both sides of it you know i understand because me like i i kind of am sympathetic to both sides because breath if i am eating i can not have smoke around me when i am eating it kind of makes me nauseous but then again </s>
mhm </s>
breath there i sit smoking a cigarette while laugh breath i am drinking so i mean i am a very um pathetic smoker that is what i call myself breath a pathetic smoker breath </s>
right i i i thi uh i think it is one of um breath i think it is really i i i if we are talking about bars and restaurants i think it is really the responsibility of the restaurant to determine who their customer is </s>
mhm right </s>
um you know i i if it is if it is a bar type atmosphere a or you know if they have a bar breath and you know it is a it is an adult non-family oriented type of place </s>

mhm oh that wow that is pretty polite </s>
breath you know what i mean so </s>
mhm </s>
you know i i think it a i think it it it has a lot to do more with being conscious of what people around you a a a what their wishes are than do you know what i mean </s>
r exactly mhm exactly i i totally agree with that and i and i also think that w when it comes to like you said bars or restaurant m more with bars if if you don't like that setting you know the whole package in general </s>
you do not have to be there right </s>
then you don't have to be there whereas a restaurant like you know you are gonna take kids there and and you know family and people who are not non-smokers i am not saying that everybody that goes to a bar is a smoker but breath the fact that you can make that conscious choice if you do not like that part of the bar scene then you know do not go to the bar </s>
right do not go right </s>
you know breath um and i think but there are some places where like such as airplanes i do not think you should be smoking on airplanes because breath </s>
oh god no i e even even i would not smoke on an airplane breath because because i can not breath on the thing to begin i d to begin with let alone breath and the seats are so small and undoubtedly you are sandwiched between two large people </s>
first of all breath right i mean it is such a small com laugh it is a very small right </s>
y y you just can not do it when i was a non-smoker </s>
breath and it is such a small com go ahead </s>

uh-huh </s>
you know i would almost gag in a plane because people were smoking around me i can not imagine smoking on a plane what a nightmare mean because you are you are stuck in that stagnant air </s>
wow i would just think mhm and i think it is too confined of a space to be able to have proper ventilation </s>
right </s>
be like you were in a forest fire laugh </s>
yeah that is that is true that is how i felt back row of the plane smallest seats and i got a row of smokers in front of me </s>

mhm </s>

oh okay </s>
that is how i got into the program </s>
oh okay </s>
you work for omnipoint </s>
yeah </s>
oh in bethlehem </s>
yeah </s>
everybody i talked to works there so far </s>
laugh everyone i have talked to knows someone who works there so </s>
laugh i keep waiting for one of these times i am going to call and i am i am going to get my girlfriend laugh </s>
laugh that would be funny </s>
yeah </s>
yeah i been surprised i talked to people i actually worked with so that was pretty cool </s>
oh that is not bad </s>
yeah but </s>
do do do do do laugh breath this ain't this ain't one of the better subjects i got </s>
yeah pretty much yeah i i got some not so good ones i i do not know somebody answered me like i was done talking for like twenty seconds we are like oh what else do we have to talk about you know </s>
yeah ah my girlfriend just called like ten minutes ago she got a subject about whether you believe in ghosts and stuff i am like breath why can not i get that subject </s>
uh-huh yeah really </s>
i think anything that they could get especially concerning educational would be beneficial on helping them um let's say readjust like in society and breath hopefully you know be able to be employed and breath getting jobs or for education or anything else so i'd go strongly with education and recreational um i would say that could be necessary i would not put it as strong but just as a balance like on the person for like a physical endeavors and breath kind of sort of dealing like with the environment like on that breath um </s>
yeah </s>
that i think that would all be very helpful too </s>
well i know one </s>
what is your feel </s>
one thing that bugs me is that i i live in allentown and whenever you are like at the eric in allentown or actually i do not i do not i think think they actually closed that down but you can hear them they are playing racquetball up there that is i do not think they should have like racquetball courts and stuff like that but like uh exercise in like an exercise room or weights or something like that or a running track or something you know they should should be able to keep in shape but uh to have like racquetball courts and basketball courts and things like that that is a little over excessive i think </s>
well basketball part something that you could have even out in the ghetto in like certain neighborhoods just like north philadelphia i mean just on ghetto street things or something so um i mean basketball is i mean racquetball it is a little but more of a built up court but that is still i do not know if that is really that excessive or not i mean breath we are not talking about like say somewher place like elmer or allenwood breath with health spas and golf courses and other different things so breath the educational i am even much more in favor for </s>
yeah they definitely should have have ah educational facilities because ah eh yeah you go in there and and you can not you can not do nothing anyways you know so you might as well have might as well be able to learn something </s>
oh yeah well i mean hopefully like breath all that learning will be transferable take to the outside environment i'm trying to withdraw and cope in society and get a job and move on from there </s>
mhm </s>
so um hopefully that should be the best bet for everybody's tax dollars </s>
yeah i do not mind spending my tax dollars on that </s>
and as i am saying like the recreational like were like burning off steam and energy and as far as like with recreational and energy only like cardiovascular and staying in shape and whatever else i mean i i i think that is good too i mean </s>
yeah i did not </s>
i do not know if racketball is really that excessive i mean breath basketball especially is like pretty basic </s>
yeah i did not think about that uh that that actually probably is a good idea that way they are not in there getting into more trouble and have having to stay in prison longer you know </s>
yeah well as i am saying like a basketball court you could find that in any corner of north philadelphia or something i mean really all you're talking about like on that is like your tar and like your hoop and the ball to run around and shoot like other than the rules of the game which breath actually in some respects um breath that should be building team and camaraderie and working together and all too um like people trying to work things out together i mean breath things can get hot like in sports but breath hopefully like people are like working things uh out that they are not getting that way </s>
mhm </s>
and it is like on good teamship camaraderie so um you know so the recreational has something to be said for it too so i mean all in all i think i would say yes to both i mean breath i put much more of a stronger emphasis on the education but breath uh you know there is things i can favor for the recreational too so breath how did you get involved in this from allentown </s>
um well i am working for omnipoint and they she got a fax with uh i guess at work </s>
uh-huh </s>
and uh and this is basically her phone she does not she just does not she does not use it so she just let me have it and she got like a great deal on it like uh uh free calls within the tri state area </s>
mhm </s>
and uh like four bucks a month </s>
mhm </s>
so you can not beat that four bucks a month </s>
four bucks a month you are kidding me that is fabulous </s>
yeah laugh and i can u unlimited time so this does not even cost me anything </s>
as far as </s>
well that's the thing yeah like like all things you have to have a balance you know sometimes you do have to get out </s>
mhm also it depends on you know if you're doing it alone or going with someone breath and how many people and so forth </s>
right right i i i'm like you like i like to stay home and watch a movie but every now and then i like to go out you know i get awed by the big screen and you know i like it when bullets are flying all around with the speakers and stuff breath </s>
mhm laugh </s>
you know at home you can only get so much unless you have like a a big system </s>
true true and you're right the last movie that i saw let's see ah i can picture it but i can't remember the oh bone lipsmack </s>
oh the bone collector yeah that's the last movie i saw too that was a good movie </s>
that's it yeah breath uh-huh it was </s>
yeah </s>
and it was it was good to see it in a good theater with you know all the extras there </s>
hm huh where you from </s>
pennsylvania </s>
pennsylvania do they have good theaters in pennsylvania or </s>
well right down right near me is a brand new very huge very modern one yeah </s>
oh really yeah that's the thing you got to go to a modern one because if you go to old one you know the seats are uncomfortable they're cramped </s>
breath right </s>
you know the one they just built one by my house too and it has cup holders and breath the seats are like recliners and there's plenty of room </s>
right mhm yeah it's pretty awesome so where are you at </s>
yeah breath i'm in jersey </s>
and who do you work for </s>
i work i don't work for omnipoint i work for a company called apex </s>
okay </s>
there medical communication </s>
you're one of the few that doesn't work for omnipoint </s>
but ironically i i have a friend that does work for omnipoint she's the one that got me hooked up into this so there's a connection there's definitely omnipoint driven laugh breath </s>
laugh yes yes </s>
you know what i think i think it's good to watch old movies at home movies you've seen already </s>
uh-huh </s>
like like you know how there's always a movie </s>
because you don't need the breath yeah that's a good point </s>
exactly you don't need to be completely immersed in it </s>
right </s>
you know like animal house i could watch animal house any given time </s>
laugh </s>
an and you know i don't necessarily need to see it in a theater </s>
i guess what i like about renting them and having them at home is that i tend to not like to sit still for so long </s>
uh-huh </s>
so breath i at home i can just turn it off come back to it </s>
that's true yeah that's true see do you have a dvd player </s>
no </s>
that's that's big that that really makes it nice </s>
you have that or you've seen them oh </s>
uh yeah uh well uh both i've seen them and i i i've seen them enough to go out and buy one </s>
laugh </s>
an and it's a huge difference between that and a and a vcr cause a vcr is like it's crap you know even the best ones you know they just the they the picture stinks </s>
yeah i guess once you're used to something really good </s>
yeah breath yeah like the theater you know the theaters always has the good ah </s>
mhm </s>
the good thing </s>
true </s>
hm </s>
it's tough to hit the movies that you want to see sometimes in the theater though </s>
but it is cheaper </s>
like i intend to go to a movie and then by the time i get around to going it's not in anymore </s>
sure now with so many movies coming out they only last like a week </s>
yeah yeah that's what it is and then </s>
and and </s>
so you end up having to wait six months to rent them anyway </s>
right unless you have pay per view then then you can get it like the week after it comes out laugh </s>
well true </s>
you need a good video store by you too you know so that you can just run down the street and get a good movie come home </s>
yeah we </s>
as opposed to like running i mean if you're going to go way out to rent a movie breath you might as well just go to a theater </s>
true that's true too </s>
you know you got to get dressed and everything get in your car and drive ten minutes breath when the theaters five minutes it doesn't make sense </s>
yeah and the bad thing about going to like a blockbuster or something is </s>
huh </s>
oh it's rent three for this price and i always get more than i actually can watch anyway </s>
laugh that's funny laugh breath </s>
laugh laugh and they of course they know that that's why they do it to me </s>
and then they got all the other things like th they got the popcorn right there so it comes out to being just as much as going to the movies </s>
mhm laugh yeah </s>
laugh it's tough to get someone to go out on a first date to your house to watch a movie though so we definitely still need theaters hm </s>
well that's a good point yeah it is a good social thing </s>
yeah you ever been to a drive in </s>
very good oh yeah </s>
ah i miss those </s>
yeah well at least around here </s>
you still do </s>
actually went to one in this past summer </s>
really </s>
uh-huh went to see the sixth sense at the drive in </s>
really and they still got the little speakers you got to hang inside your car laugh those they probably sound like you're listening to a tin can </s>
yeah yeah laugh yeah it's not the best you know and and it definitely isn't as good a movie theater but it's so much fun in the summertime </s>
very especially with a bunch of your friends i think you'd just goof off in the car laugh </s>
mhm laugh </s>
is the is that drive in old or it's relatively new as well </s>
ah actually i well we've got a couple around me that are very old </s>
uh-huh </s>
th the one i went to was out of not even in my city i was visiting friends two hours over in harrisburg so they've got them all around breath </s>
people doing that now and i would prefer to see them working working capacity rather than breath being indoors and getting to do gym work and all that kind of thing </s>
i can kind of go both ways in some respects ah i mean wi w i have got a background in education so ca i appreciate </s>
breath </s>
that type of stuff no matter who you are </s>
right </s>
but then then again know our tax dollars are paying for them to be in their and you would like to at least get something back </s>
right i mean i i believe that they should have </s>
you know so </s>
i believe they should have help and guidance and i believe they should be educated breath </s>
mhm </s>
but i i feel like there is too much um i i feel like sometimes it is a camp for them when they go to prison </s>
yeah you are you are you are right </s>
you know breath </s>
you are you are you are exactly correct on that and um it get it gets to be a little a little bit ah a little bit much i believe i mean i i am not going to deny people some things but i mean they are the are the are in prison to pay a debt </s>
right and there is nothing deterring them from from going to prison </s>
right i mean all all it is eh </s>
their is </s>
it is supposedly they have the same comforts as as at home you know obviously it is not but i mean it you know in some cases it can be pretty darn close </s>
yeah </s>
i mean what what is what is the uh they are not learning anything from from being in there </s>
no no there are getting big they work out and </s>
you they ju </s>
breath the women argue and from the i mean all the programs i have seen i would not know because i have i have never been in a prison or known anyone in prison but i have se seen things on hbo specials and breath breath and it looks like yeah their their living some sort of um difficult time but it is not n not anything productive </s>
right i know when i was in college i uh had done a uh oops i have got to watch my driving here </s>
laugh breath </s>
i i um was in was in a prison doing a research report and um it was just on a it was in a county prison and i know the money is not there in some of the like the county jails like uh you know in the local areas to do all those things you know it is a lot less money than the state gives you know in like and the fed that the federal government might give </s>
yeah </s>
and obviously you do not have your hardened criminals in the county jails either </s>
right </s>
you know but i mean what i saw was pretty darn spartan to be honest with you </s>
really </s>
at least on that on that level yeah i mean i you know they had the recreation yard they could go out and you know they had a couple things of weights and a a television but i mean you know their was not no big old library and there were not computers at their you know for them to use and you know it was a jail </s>
and so they spent their time doing what what d what do they do </s>
you know and ah at the county jails shooting shooting basketball i guess or uh reading the newspaper some you know they were not doing very much i mean i did not have a lot of ac i did not have access really to the prisoners i mean they only let me in there when they when they had them outside </s>
yeah </s>
you know but i you know i can kind of see all the facilities and everything and uh i mean they had you know personal books and things and then again on the on the county eh the county side you get more visits from families and stuff too you know there is there is there is some things that are a little bit more lenient there than </s>
right right </s>
you know than others also so you know it it is different in that aspect also you know so maybe it might not be so bad for them in in some respects but you know as having all as far as having all those facilities at their ah um ri right at their their hands to use uh i know that i that i know they do not exist but i do not know they could do do something worth while and i know know down south they have the good old chain gangs out there </s>
breath yeah they do </s>
doing work </s>

well they look at that is something they are going to do much later in life it is not as romanticized </s>

right </s>
you know both both boys and girls in our family you know feel the same way breath about getting a job going to college um those kind of things </s>
lipsmack i think it is so much more difficult to make it financially anymore </s>

you know the uh the old school thinking that alright you get married </s>
right breath </s>
as a young person to basically fit yourself financially </s>
right </s>
you know you work together and it is a lot easier doing it that way than breath doing it alone </s>
yeah </s>
but you know nowadays you know you got to get your education in order or breath um </s>
right and get your career started before you have babies breath </s>
exactly because i mean that complicates the issue tremendously </s>

lipsmack right </s>
but her i guess she figures pretty much although i am sure breath that still at her age she would like um to be able to stay home for a certain amount of time breath but i think she knows that she is you know there is a chance that they may not happen at all or that she will definitely be you know working you know full-time most of her life </s>
breath right </s>
yeah have do you have any kids breath </s>
right yeah breath yeah i have one stepdaughter uh yeah my first marriage my wife divorced and uh this is her second marriage breath </s>
uh-huh breath uh-huh breath </s>

the way you know she kind of looks at the whole situation breath eh bo basically boils down to when she married she married too young </s>
uh-huh breath </s>
lipsmack and you do not make the wisest choices then you know you are premature </s>
right right and and and you have a lot longer time to grow apart and for much different reasons </s>
breath right right you have not fully explored who you are yet </s>
yeah yeah right right </s>
you know and it is difficult if the other person breath there is one thing some people luck out they marry at you know twelve and fourteen alright breath </s>
right right </s>
and they are pretty much the same type of people so they kind of grow on the same path </s>
right breath </s>
so yeah obviously they are going to be they are going to have a great happy marriage breath </s>
uh-huh </s>

even harder no breath no right </s>
you know it is like what is the point why should we be unhappy when you know i will just move on breath right </s>
when there is happiness to be found right but that that is kind of it is sad that that it that that is kind of very selfish which i think is a lot different then what it used to be i i do not think that that is wrong or right but people are much more self-serving than they used to be selfish is probably the wrong word um everybody believes that they deserve happiness and they do </s>
yeah right self-serving right </s>
but i think we find you know happiness a lot differently than than like or parents did </s>
right at what expense </s>
yeah and at what expense right right </s>
at at ah what expense and ah you know it to me a lot of that also is uh it kind of boils down to the fact that you have options that maybe people did not have early in the century </s>
that is right </s>
you know women now </s>
oh sure </s>
you know you can get your education and actually be treated fair </s>
right </s>
on a lot of levels breath i mean before the discrimination was there gender discrimination where breath </s>

uh-huh yes </s>
laugh </s>
and see what i am doing is i am trying to as i get into the fifties i am not trying to work for anybody anymore </s>
oh i see </s>
mhm so that is what i am up to right now everything that i could possibly do to achieve that goal i am doing that </s>
so what kind of business are you trying to start </s>
i am doing a mail-order business </s>
okay </s>
what it is i get information from different companies alright like you might have something about ah uh your telecommunications where they have you could get the eight hundred line you could get </s>
uh-huh </s>
a cell phone you could get a calling card </s>
right </s>
then other opportunities you could have um or a fat buster you know diet club that and you have one where they got uh recently got a a sent out for all this information </s>
mhm </s>
and this one would have about natural products to where alright if you use any soap deodorant mouthwash it all supposed to have some kind of chemical in it that is actually going to be irritating to you down the line </s>
mhm </s>
and what the whole thing is just like how it is with the cigarettes they say you got certain products that you use everyday like uh shampoo for instance is supposed to have degreasers in it just like they use on car engines </s>
oh really </s>
uh-huh yeah i got all the information and this is one company got a line of products to where they say is all natural stuff in their ingredients there is nothing harmful and that is they have their own makeup line you know they got a variety of stuff </s>
mhm </s>
and so what i am doing i am setting up looking at that i am looking at that thing in telecommunications i am looking at something like about a combination maybe three things </s>
mhm </s>
because what i want to do is maybe by march it is all of those things i just told you about the different companies </s>
right </s>
i want to give them all their shot and whatever comes back will be money coming back to me </s>
mhm </s>
and that is what i am setting for i am trying to deal with uh three different places </s>
wow </s>
and whoever pays off the best you know whoever uh make ah i will put and my returns the best breath that is the one i am going to deal with on the long term basis </s>
hm sounds like you have it all planned out </s>
mhm yeah i do not have it totally planned out but what i am doing like for mail-order campaigns you need a lot of stamps </s>
mhm </s>
mhm and um with their cra </s>
laugh </s>
what was you getting ready to say </s>
no i just because you repeated me because i was like mhm and you were like uh-huh </s>
uh oh oh but uh in the long run though that is what i am trying to set up for i am trying to set up to where when i take and do mail-ins on all of them </s>
mhm </s>
breath i am trying to set it up to where i could take it and actually to around five thousand </s>
wow </s>
mhm that is what i am trying to do and out of five thousand people breath because like they actually said i have been getting um breath information on mail-order itself when it is a good times to put out stuff </s>
right </s>
and right now it is a bad time because everybody got their christmas mystique on their minds </s>
right right </s>
so this here more or less towards holidays is a bad time and they said uh january through march would be your best targeted times </s>
i was going to say like the august time maybe because uh well you really do not have any holidays around there </s>
uh-huh yeah but also that could be fatal because remember you got labor day coming up you got people that go to uh uh you know summer trips people that rent uh housing at the shore in jersey </s>
mhm </s>
you know breath so august is a little touch and go cough </s>
hm </s>
mhm so so what it what actually happens breath with what i am doing that actually help me uh target different audiences and so and the just like it says as long as i do not take it throw it out there at the wrong time breath i could take it and make money over the mail-order </s>
mhm </s>
and um that is what i am up to </s>
hm so you are not into christmas </s>
okay i don't think so </s>
neither do i but you know you have to look at that both ways of if we're not there things can get real bad </s>
that's right </s>
and if we're and if we're there some us soldiers could get killed so you know i mean eh that's six in one a half a dozen of another you know which way do you want to go on that thing that's eh you know </s>
lipsmack breath </s>
uh that's the bottom line </s>
well i uh breath uh breath </s>
so can </s>
breath i i i think that we shouldn't get involved in as many breath outside wor uh words uh worlds and uh breath and and many of the countries that breath that they having so much trouble i mean we have trouble enough breath in our country breath and we don't take care of our own you know </s>
yeah i know that mhm breath i know that but they still breath no you can't let breath eh these countries go you know </s>
but uh </s>
there's too much killing over there in in bosnia sarajevo eh you know all those eh countries breath they're all kill </s>
uh breath i i i definitely know i i i definitely understand i breath i know but uh breath like like if you look at it this way how many of our solders d die during uh breath dur during the the gulf war )) breath and and it wasn't even our business you know what i mean </s>
no yeah </s>
you know what i mean breath </s>
well what about eh vietnam wasn't our war neither and we had about seventy five sold- seventy five thousand soldiers breath get killed over there </s>
that's right </s>
breath so i mean breath </s>
a and breath but i mean if we would not have intervened in kosovo breath uh many many other innocent people would of had died you know </s>
yeah that's why that's why we got to intervene sometime breath even though we we shouldn't be there but you got to look look out for the uh those poor people who are going to get killed you know </s>
hm that's right </s>
that's what i think anyhow hm </s>
i i think that's the pay we price for being uh uh uh you know one of the most powerful countries in the world </s>
yeah well that's it you know if we don't do it nobody's going to do it </s>
breath and also we have to understand that breath tho those people have power of breath you know making bombs and and and and and th they could go end up into the wrong hands breath and they could eventually come over here and and </s>
uh oh yeah well you see you see the the what's the name the </s>
blow the shit out of us laugh breath breath </s>
the eh putting security at all the airports now </s>
mhm </s>
breath train stations they don't they feel something is going to happen breath during the holidays </s>
yes yes i i saw that news eh it's b eh </s>
yeah </s>
in new york city they were they were they are doing that because they say breath they have two people in mind that they're trying to uh breath they got arrested already lipsmack </s>
yeah </s>
you know how many of our people could die because of that </s>
so yeah well that's what you have to watch out for </s>
but i i also believe that if we were not involved in many of those breath you know o other countries we wouldn't be you know involved at all we wouldn't have been targets </s>
oh yeah they would have been annihilated some of them </s>
breath yeah yeah </s>
some of them would have been wi uh wiped right off the map </s>
that's right breath </s>
you know so that's my opinion of it and eh you know e everybody's got their own different opinion </s>
i i breath i i i believe so i i think everybody has their own opinion and breath </s>
by yeah </s>
i i think that's like i say like eh breath before it was the price we have to pay for breath for trying to stop the hate in uh breath in o other countries but we we sometimes forget breath that we have problems of our own in this country that we have to deal with </s>
uh-huh </s>
breath and we have breath we have uh uh you know a deficit in in our economic breath because we keep investing all this money into different countries that we shouldn't be putting our money into breath </s>
mhm uh yeah they're all getting fo they're all getting foreign aid you know they like that </s>
you know we as tax breath yet w yes breath and breath yes and we a as tax payers should be concerned on whether our money should be spent elsewhere or here </s>
mhm breath well i definitely think i it's the first thing they eh should do this country is wipe out the drugs the first thing </s>
you know </s>
then after that everything will fall in place but they don't do that so and breath and keep the money in this country </s>
mhm </s>
breath nobody appreciates it when you do anything for them </s>
they don't they don't we give give give but i don't see it </s>
give and nobody appreciates it </s>
i do i don't see anybody bringing anything into the united states </s>
laugh breath nobody appreciates it </s>
breath you know what i mean breath breath yes you are here right in the united states right breath </s>
breath excuse me </s>
i i'm cal i'm talking to somebody whose breath here in the us right </s>
ah </s>
breath this is the first time i make a call on my on my thing breath i breath i didn't start my program too late laugh breath </s>
mhm </s>
totally forgot about my thing breath and i got an email at work breath to do it </s>
is this the first time you've been on the line </s>
yeah i think so too i i think that is i could not agree more actually that is exactly what i was going to say um i live in new york and i know that if i had to hold a minimum wage job i would i would die on on five twenty five an hour </s>
exactly </s>
yeah but i think also that um i mean it is it would have to be at least like eight or nine dollars an hour here in new york but in you know say eh the midwest or somewhere it might be less you know people might do okay on like </s>
exactly </s>
six dollars an hour </s>
exactly that is what i would say breath </s>
have you have you held a minimum wage job or have you ever done that </s>
no no </s>
i did only when i was in like in high school and stuff i did but and </s>
i probably had one when i was in high school but i was so happy to just have a job did not even pay attention breath </s>
exactly i wonder if maybe if a person was is a student or you know it is like somebody in high school or something maybe they would have a minimum wage for a certain i guess it kind of discriminates though if it were a certain kind of person </s>
yeah </s>
you know depending on your your living situation it would it would be discrimination </s>
exactly ah i it is it is hard it is like it is hard to determine what is what so i think it is fair to just say depending on the cost of living per state </s>
yeah </s>
should determine whether or not they should um ro raise it or not because it m that what it is now it might be enough for um certain people in certain states </s>
exactly </s>
but i do not think it should be the same for per per state </s>
yeah </s>
because it is different </s>
yeah lipsmack this is the first time i have gotten that question it is it is not too hard to talk about compared to some of the other stuff i have had to talk about laugh </s>
actually this is the first time i um ever got this question too somebody else um was telling me breath actually a couple of people are telling me that breath they have gotten breath um certain questions two or three times </s>
yeah i got one twice i got the e-mail one twice um but this is </s>
i have only gotten that one once </s>
yeah </s>
i got the um the union one twice </s>
hm i have not gotten that one yet but i guess that time will come if i keep making more calls breath </s>
mhm actually i made all the calls i was supposed to make i am waiting for incoming calls at this point </s>
oh </s>
do you actually </s>
well they certainly pay us more than minimum wage to make these calls so </s>
that is true and just for six minutes too </s>
yeah well that would be nice if they made this the standard </s>
right laugh hey some people do laugh </s>
that is true </s>
dep dep depends on the job </s>
yeah but i could see i mean it is it is so hard to say because depending on which job you know if </s>
mhm </s>
if you are doing a certain kind of job you say okay well that kind of job is really only worth so much per hour so you know some people want to get away with paying minimum wage for jobs that end up being worth a lot more money for the time put in </s>
right </s>
i wonder if there are you know how could there be standards that that say what kind of job you have got and what kind they have to pay minimum wage and what kind you have to pay more </s>
exactly because it g gets kind of grey there too </s>
mhm </s>
because it is like oh i work at mcdonald's </s>
what laugh </s>
but i am only working minimum wage </s>
yeah </s>
i mean people do not understand fast food restaurants are busy all the time </s>
exactly there is a lot of stress involved and there is uh there is an aspect of it that you really have to do stuff exactly right </s>
mhm </s>
you talk about some stuff that they might say well that is a no brain job and you know you better only pay minimum wage but if you have to like make stuff to order i would say that could be kind of a pain in the neck depending on where where you are some people are pretty picky breath </s>
yep </s>
i know fast food in new york is laugh is crazy laugh breath </s>
see that is why i do not like new york </s>
where do you live </s>

so you know she said after the lady made her go back and do something well she finally told the lady look since you made me do all that you are going to look at this you are going to look at what i am talking about but you know it is it is the attitude with people they people have such attitudes </s>
yep mhm </s>
you know they just outdo themselves </s>
lipsmack yep </s>
well good for you laugh </s>
yep did she get a deal did she get a deal on the camera </s>
yeah she got her deal on the camera what it was it was coming with it was coming with some free stuff </s>
good mhm </s>
and the lady was giving her just whatever she wanted her to have and she said when the lady ran her around the store a little bit when she came back she said now you are going to listen to what i have to say </s>
laugh </s>
you are going to look at what i am telling you and you are going to give me my item free or i am not going to buy the camera breath and she said then the the lady finally looked she said oh that must be what is in that box over there </s>
yep breath laugh i kind of sympathize with them because it is a tough time of year with all of the people out there and you know customers as you know are not always the most reasonable people in the world to deal with in the first place laugh </s>
uh you have think i have this topic before uh lipsmack let us see breath i pretty much just said uh that they should not um really limit where they should go i mean they should pretty much go where they want to go </s>
true </s>
it just it just uh the cost factor i guess </s>
yeah that would uh breath might factor into it a little bit uh </s>
yeah i do not i do not really know how much or what exactly the parents should what reasons they would uh limit uh where they go exactly besides the cost i do not really see what would really be logical at all </s>
right cost uh i could see cost being a factor holding them back and maybe even location if they would want to go visit if it is too far away or something of that nature but uh breath yeah if they want to go whatever they need to go for whatever they want to do breath eh they should be able to do that </s>
so you think they should uh have a say in where they go </s>
i do not think they should have a say i think they should encourage the person to decide you know what would be best for them breath and honestly if uh depends on the situation parents paying for the whole thing you know they should have maybe a little bit of say in the factor but not you know the overall riding decision breath the other the person got to attend the and got to be liking the school </s>
mhm </s>
so they need to do that breath </s>
um breath </s>
do's and do not's well i do not think they should pressure them into like okay daddy went to this school you should go to this school too </s>
yeah yeah i never thought of that yeah that </s>
i think they should </s>
that is definitely something that they should not um pressure a kid into doing if the kid does not want to go i guess </s>
yeah right yeah hey may </s>
i can see i can see how yeah some parents would would encourage that </s>
yeah i would want my son to go to school but if he does not want to you know there is jobs out there where you do not really need the education albeit but uh breath you do not really need an education in some places depends on what his interests or her interests are </s>
yeah hm yeah it was not it to do i think yeah the also um they should also help like instead of just letting the kid go out off on his own kind of offer a little guidance i guess </s>
yeah </s>
maybe take a couple of trips to </s>
yeah to to different places </s>
check out yeah </s>
looking looking around different ones do not uh except the first one </s>
yeah </s>
that comes across the way yeah that is a good idea i think it should ultimately be to the child as to what school they want to go to </s>
mhm sneeze ew </s>
how did you hear about the program hello </s>
yeah </s>
still there yeah how did you hear about the program </s>
uh laugh breath eh i am fine with it hm i do not have any problems </s>
yeah how did you hear about it </s>
um my girlfriend wor uh works for omnipoint </s>
oh yeah where at </s>
and um yeah </s>
okay yeah i wo i work for omnipoint too </s>
laugh i do not really know too much about the </s>
about what </s>
uh this topic uh it seems like a pretty uh </s>
yeah </s>
open and shut </s>
i think i ah </s>
deal </s>
i i would like uh well depends on the child too if they have good grades they have uh gotten scholarships </s>
yeah </s>
um they can pretty much go where they want to if the schools will be wanting them um but </s>
mhm </s>
i find it to be uh cost effective to go to the local community college </s>
mhm </s>
for the first couple years until they decide uh breath where they want to go because you can still get your basic general education in those couple of years </s>
yeah </s>
and not have to pay a fortune for it laugh it is still pretty cost effective plus they are close closer to home </s>
mhm </s>
but all also depends on the kid i would breath i think i would encourage my kid to do that uh for a cost factor and also for the fact that you can get the same type of education right off the bat but depends they got a a scholarship how can you refuse that breath so the circumstances do change i think </s>
yeah </s>
how many calls did you make </s>
um i have lost track uh pretty much </s>
really yeah i think i am on about like nine or tenth one somewhere in that </s>
yeah </s>
breath yeah better than the first one breath im </s>
what the last one i saw was the james bond </s>
breath oh double o seven flick </s>
that was good </s>
breath yeah i saw that one before that was ah that was my next to last one </s>
i thought i thought that was pretty good he was wet through the whole thing laugh </s>
laugh breath the one thing about him though i will admit on that on that flick is that i just kind of feel they should do breath some different things you know they i do not know they sh they should just kind of spice it up a little bit </s>
yeah </s>
and it is because they are still playing with the formula you know eh </s>
yeah that breath that is true </s>
getting a little tired but um beyond that i r i enjoyed the movie i checked it out and i liked it breath you know </s>
yeah i liked it too </s>
lipsmack yeah as far as toy story two is concerned i uh really thought they they s they scripted it much nicer this time around the story was much better </s>
really </s>
you got yeah you got into the characters who they really were you know beyond just kind of like the initial movie where they were just kind of like meeting each other like everyone was meeting each other for the first time you know now you have a little background and they got into a deeper story y you got to you got to check it out it is not just for kids </s>
yeah we have been thinking about taking the kids it is just with the holidays it finally it </s>
oh it is yeah </s>
the hectic stuff is over now so we can relax and maybe we will get to take them while they are off of school </s>
yeah breath yeah breath and that is the other thing i really love about going to the theater verses you being at home breath is that in the theater when something is funny you got the crowd reaction on top of the movie </s>
right </s>
you know where at home it is just you laughing or maybe whoever you are watching it with you know which is not the same if it is really like a funny moment or you hear people cheering breath i saw star wars that way uh the first episode episode one </s>
mhm </s>
breath i went to the movie theater to check it out and it was just like a communal experience you know </s>
right well that is the thing at home like you said it is just you and whoever you are with at the time you do not get the audience reaction </s>
right exactly breath and i just kind of i always get the late fees laugh know what i mean laugh i am always getting whacked uh i am always getting whacked </s>
yeah </s>
well where do you go to rent do you have like a preferred </s>
usually blockbuster </s>
blockbuster yeah </s>
yeah </s>
i like hollywood video i really do it is just that they are a little farther away than the blockbuster next to my house </s>
right i was going to say we do not have one of those really i mean we have one near us but not as close as blockbuster </s>
right right the only thing that gets me about blockbuster is that uh i do not know i just i think they kind of sometimes with the new flicks you know they are a little more expensive than some of the other places and breath but you know </s>
right i think we just really go there for convenience </s>
right </s>
more so because it is close </s>
right right mhm i hear what you are saying breath i think m sooner or later though it is going to be with the new hd tv sets and uh when you get a d i do not have a dvd player yet but </s>
no we do not either </s>
lipsmack yeah but i think uh once you get the bigger tv's and they work better with the dvd players it will i </s>
some of those bigger tv's are really nice now it used to be when they first came out that everybody was saying oh they have such poor quality well they are not like that anymore </s>
no no it is crystal clear now you know </s>
i mean we looking at them the other day in fact breath i said you know i would like one of these breath </s>
right not the the other ones looked like blotchy all like washed out </s>
yeah these new ones do not look like that </s>
no it looks like a real tv you know just bigger yeah and just nicer so i do not know maybe i think it will change a little bit there you know because if you can set up your room you know once it is dark and it is a big enough screen you can approximate it </s>
you can set it up like a theater with the surround sound and </s>
right breath all the rest of it breath but </s>
well another thing too is they make the theater so much nicer you actually want to go there because they have a lot of them have the stadium seating now </s>
yeah hm yeah </s>
i mean some of them even have the little coffee bars laugh type things </s>
which one is your favorite </s>
we used to go to the sauken valley one </s>
i i oh okay </s>

i like that one </s>
they are really nice breath they are not as crowded either </s>
yeah no they are not that is one reason we like to go down there </s>

yeah </s>
yeah i pro i like going to the carmight because i just think the got it together all the way around </s>
i heard that one is really nice </s>
yeah i d i prefer that one because i have been to most every theater in the valley and uh breath the only one that i kind of i got a soft spot for is the boyde and if you ever been there in in bethlehem breath it has got that old time feel and uh breath yeah i like </s>
well yeah mhm right we were just talking about that the other day how with the old time ones they are getting rid of probably because they can not make money in competition with these newer ones but those are the nicer theaters </s>
right right they got the atmosphere </s>
right </s>
yeah i like it a lot i like it a lot better as for a night out if you just going to hang out in the theater for a while breath it is really nice </s>
but i think they worry too much about competition and let us build bigger and more and you know history is </s>
that is the way they are going </s>
you know this is history </s>
yeah yeah it is important too </s>
do not get rid of all of our history you know laugh </s>
yeah i i hear you well you got to support it too like every once in a while i will go to the boyde </s>

yeah i do not know these kids today um a lot of them i do not know how they do so well breath but um i think that is one thing they do need to prepare them for because it is like it is not the same as when you are sitting in high school behind a desk in a class with thirty kids </s>

the topic is about uh whether you think there are enough local public libraries and uh are they uh doing well evidently something to that effect laugh that was a couple of minutes ago laugh i forgot um </s>

oh really </s>

uh-huh uh-huh </s>

breath </s>
then it was in the past and you know twenty or thirty years ago </s>
right </s>
so they're going to see things anyway and they're going to have questions and i think if they do it i i've seen them doing now where you know from uh from uh fif from uh kindergarten i guess a five or six year old where they go slowly and you know try to teach it breath and then they as they get older what they can understand better as they get to the high school years or whatever then it's then it would make more sense to be a little bit more detailed </s>
right </s>
but it's alw- you know what to me uh it's always the home is always the most important part just like </s>
yes </s>
trying to teach them how to act and to you know </s>
exactly breath </s>

oh yeah </s>
trying to help everybody and this and that you know </s>
and i got two of my own </s>
yeah that is what i have two grandkids yeah </s>
okay how do you feel about it </s>
uh i think um uh yeah i think it should be required to at least learn a foreign language um when i went to school it made there was a requirement uh you may not use it but it gives you gives you a chance to be more diverse and you might get the opportunity to go to that country of wherever you choose ah whatever language and um um not um because you learned a language you might say hey that's kind of cool and learn about the culture things like that you might just say hey what the heck let's just go visit there and i can try out my language </s>
right i find that to be true because um when i was in the military i um well before i went into the military i attended college and i had um japanese and then when i went into the military i went to japan laugh so it kind of came in handy i you know somewhat </s>
exactly </s>
right cough but um japanese is kind of difficult to learn you know um i would think german would be a a better language you know that's easy to um adapt to and understand and speak what do feel about that </s>
mhm i i um actually my uh my girlfriend is german and she speaks to me me speaks german to me sometimes </s>
uh-huh </s>
and um uh teach me some of the language and the words and i am thinking okay some of it's okay yeah some some of the things i can understand but um as far as easy to understand and easy to learn um i find that french and spanish i think are the two easiest to learn </s>
oh you do </s>
yeah </s>
uh-huh i think spanish is is is very difficult because they speak it with you know um a lot of speed laugh </s>
that's true </s>
so yeah it makes it you know a little bit hard to understand you know well japanese too but you know breath i don't know i guess you have to really be into a particular um language in order to you know get in depth with it somewhat </s>
uh the the the spanish there's uh there's uh countless dialects </s>
breath </s>
from uh south america central america </s>
mhm </s>
puerto rico uh uh mexico uh spain </s>
right </s>
there's all these different dialects and each time they can tell if um eh you know they can tell the individual eh you know when they speak they're when they they're all the same language </s>
mhm well yeah that's </s>
but they can but they can tell uh whether you're from mexico or south america when you start talking </s>
right that's true that's true uh yeah like japanese has one word has so many meanings you know even when you when you read it </s>
mhm </s>
you know um it has so many meanings so but um you got the the the japanese you got the breath the asians um the vietnamese the the camber cambodians you know all have a different language so to speak </s>
mhm </s>
but um they all come from basically the same culture i suppose </s>
were you able to read uh read it as well as speak it </s>
no i wasn't laugh no i wasn't not at all uh-huh that's very difficult </s>
oh yeah because i see those oh you know those words or those symbols uh uh one symbol you know means a whole whole sentence almost </s>
right right right that's what i'm saying ha one word has so many meanings give a greetings or if i'm at the market how much um breath you know goodbye hello on the telephone you know things like that just the basic basics breath you know but it did come in handy over there breath i was able to keep people from cheating me laugh when i would buy something you know </s>
laugh </s>
uh-huh have have you been to a foreign company ah country </s>
well um uh yeah i visited a foreign country but uh where i went they speak uh they speak english down in the caribbean </s>
oh okay okay </s>
and also uh canada </s>
right right </s>
but where i was i was so close to the states </s>
uh-huh </s>
they sp they spoke uh they spoke english </s>
right right right breath </s>
they may have sp uh there were their i i take that back well they had their own in uh in um breath jamaica i went they have their own little dialect </s>
uh-huh </s>
what it is basically is kind of a broken english that they speak </s>
lipsmack right right that's not hard to understand really if you really listen to it breath you know because like you said it's a broken english </s>
no </s>
breath and um it's pretty easy to understand but sometimes they get to rattling off real quick you can't understand it laugh </s>
oh yeah laugh exactly </s>
laugh i was thinking about going there myself sometime this year </s>
oh good </s>
uh-huh i don't i don't know but i wanted to go on a cruise so i said i am i am going to go on a cruise over there yeah uh-huh </s>
mhm well that's good </s>
so i don't know maybe i will maybe i won't laugh </s>
yeah i hope to uh actually uh this year coming u this year hope to um </s>
uh could i get you to hold for a second okay </s>
yeah sure </s>
hello yeah i'm sorry ha and i'm at work here laugh but um i i i been around i wa well i was twenty-two years in the military so i been around um quite a bit there to various countries and i think i'm more fonder of the uh japanese language than i am any of the other </s>
yeah that is that is pretty true laugh that is pretty true did you go to college or yeah okay </s>
yes </s>
so yeah i do not know because i i think a lot of times you know a lot of kids nowadays it seems like are going into um post-grad programs and whatnot lipsmack um just something beyond the bachelor's degree </s>
right yeah </s>
and uh just in the programs that i have seen it it has not really mattered what school you go to before you know you go to your post-grad program </s>
mhm mhm </s>
um it has a lot more to do with how well you do i you know whatever under-grad place you go to </s>
right well that that is definitely true i guess you you you would not whether or not the want to be a doctor or lawyer though </s>
yeah </s>
ah if they do then you definitely want to go towards the easier uh laugh eas e easier curriculums then because i because i you just mentioned actually it does not really matter what you learned on once you are there </s>
sure right </s>
it is the grades they care about which is sad i i i mean it is just sad i knew a guy he was going to law sch he wanted to go to law </s>
yep you just have to get there laugh </s>
school and he was studying uh if i recall he was studying uh i think it was art he was studying art </s>
uh-huh just </s>
and uh he ended up with like a three point seven you know gpa so uh if what they were looking for is high grades and uh you know lsat but </s>
uh-huh yep yep that is it you just have to get good grades and so along with that you could go to </s>
yeah really yeah people are taking like gym you know health laugh yeah music that is what they were </s>
sure yeah seriously that that was definitely a lot of my buddies that wanted to go to med school and and what not they did that they just took easy programs got good grades and and then they went off </s>
yeah yup that should not be allowed </s>
cough you know where as like i think what is that </s>
that should not even be allowed </s>
right yeah it is true you know and i think also along with that you know a a person who goes to lipsmack you know harvard or princeton or you know a really good school cough you know maybe gets a three o or so and then somebody goes to a state school and gets a three eight </s>
right </s>
you know the person from the state school is probably going to get in </s>

oh don't say that laugh </s>
laugh breath i hope not but </s>
what school do you got to </s>
ah i go to penn </s>
mhm </s>
lipsmack university of pennsylvania </s>
what are you gonna be </s>
breath ah i am at their dental school right now so i am studying dentistry </s>
oh </s>
breath so that is what i am doing and i like i would like to go into orthodontics is what i want to do </s>
mhm </s>
so that's the plan </s>
oh </s>
we will see how it all turns out here we got a ways to go but </s>
yeah </s>
so hopefully it all pans out here before too long </s>
mhm </s>
laugh </s>
i hate to go to the dentist laugh </s>
w yeah laugh that is what i hear </s>
breath oh </s>
a lot of the patients there </s>
hm yeah it it to me it only represents pain laugh that's all </s>
yeah pain and money probably huh laugh </s>
yeah not so much the money but just the pain </s>
yeah </s>
y you know like since i was seven years old and i had to go to the dentist the first time it was nothing but pain and go back and pain and go back and </s>
breath yeah </s>
you know it just i guess that is why i don't like to go laugh </s>
yeah see and that is why i would like to do the orthodontic part where it is just you know do braces and that that sort of stuff you know which can be painful but </s>
mhm yeah </s>
you know for the most part it is more of uh you know a voluntary thing that people want to have done </s>
right and you don't have to drill anything else </s>
w yeah no drilling none for that stuff laugh so hopefully it all works out here </s>
hm maybe in years to come they will have a pill that they give you and you won't get cavities you know y but you will still have to have an orthodontist to straighten out your teeth laugh </s>
laugh breath actually uh y you mention that they are they are working on a vaccine </s>
are they </s>
um yeah yeah cause it your your cavities and stuff are caused just by bacteria the same same kind of that will cause you know uh you know to k y for you to get sick </s>
right </s>
you know any other way bacterial infection and that is all is breath and so they are working on you know some different vaccines </s>
mhm </s>
to try to you know eliminate the bacteria you know there are bacterial affects in your mouth they are actually working that right now </s>
wow </s>
so who who knows you know with modern medicine they will probably pull it off breath but you know </s>
yeah they do everything else so they might as well </s>
just like all these other vaccines they might have one for for tooth decay here before too long so who knows </s>
right and there goes all the dentists laugh </s>
yeah laugh breath there is a lot of work down the drain so </s>
and you'd never you'd never want to come back </s>
oh that'd be fine with me breath it's not that far away my friends can come visit me </s>
laugh laugh hm </s>
laugh </s>
breath i guess i guess i would take it breath and um breath i don't know where i would go breath it's i mean </s>
breath mhm </s>
breath so many places to go breath that it's i mean it's hard to say i would probably settle somewhere like breath africa or some lipsmack exotic country </s>
that would be cool </s>
breath and um just live breath </s>
travel for awhile first and then settle somewhere </s>
yeah breath yeah and then just live like this whole totally different life then what i'm living now breath </s>
yeah that would be cool </s>
and spend all the million dollar breath </s>
laugh breath where in africa would you go </s>

okay </s>
laugh but i do have a friend who was in before um a couple hours </s>
mhm </s>
til somebody picked them up and they said it was horrible </s>
i can well imagine </s>
breath yeah not as horrible as i think i wish it would be though because if they are there for any length of time they seem to get better advantages than we do </s>
that is true and like where else </s>
yeah </s>
besides the military can you go to get free medical breath complete free medical a roof over your head meals </s>
they get their meals </s>
ah </s>
they get to breath work out all day and relax </s>
that is true </s>
some watch tv and </s>
mhm </s>
learn crafts </s>
absolutely </s>
and we are at work all day </s>
is that right </s>
laugh breath </s>
or if you been like me you have been looking for work for a few months </s>
oh really </s>
yeah yeah </s>
uh breath </s>
that is no fun </s>
so that is even yeah that is just it and they are eating and </s>
mhm </s>
taking care of thems- well they are not taking care of themselves but being taking care of </s>
right </s>
because they committed a crime </s>
right and </s>
totally unfair </s>
and we can even adopt one or put them on our income tax uh at um you know income tax time and claim these individuals </s>
mhm </s>
and it would be kind of nice </s>
yep </s>
considering the fact that i </s>
yeah </s>
forget exactly how many thousands that it costs to take care of one inmate for a y a year and we can not claim even a part of them </s>
yeah breath i know i used to live in florida and they used to have chain gangs </s>
uh oh really </s>
yeah i remember driving down the highway and </s>
uh-huh </s>
seeing them out there picking up things on the highway and they were connected </s>
uh-huh </s>
just in case and i remembered thinking at first i remember thinking wow it is really hot and they are out there doing that and then i thought again and i thought well you know what they did what they did </s>
mhm </s>
so maybe it is okay that they are out there picking up that trash on the side of the road </s>
that is absolutely true </s>
laugh not that the trash should have been there in the first place </s>
right </s>
but i guess if somebody is going to have to do it they would rather it be somebody who committed a crime than me </s>
right now if they really want to do something with them let them come help the like ma right now it is snowing here in philly so they can do some shoveling of the snow </s>
yeah yeah i am here in bethlehem and it is pretty heavy </s>
alright </s>
and they should be out there so that tomorrow our children will be able to go to school and they won't close the schools down because they will have cleaned it all up </s>
right absolutely </s>
yeah lipsmack yup so i got a similar question </s>
mhm </s>
in the past like this it was do i think that my tax money is being put to good use and it was basically for prisons and the same thing and i think we both agreed </s>
mhm </s>
no laugh </s>
oh okay </s>
breath laugh we both agreed that ah breath um i definitely think that they should get counseling </s>
mhm </s>
i am all for that </s>
alright </s>
but i am not for the gyms and the televisions and i do not even know that i think that they should see their loved ones </s>
hm d </s>
i </s>
maybe </s>
you know that sounds rough but </s>
yeah </s>
um i guess they should have thought of that before they did what they did </s>
ah well maybe it depends on the crime uh if it was and if it </s>
breath yeah i am talking i am talking hard criminals </s>
uh-huh oh okay oh i get you </s>
yeah laugh i think petty </s>
uh-huh </s>
petty they should uh definitely do some sort of community service where necessary </s>
okay </s>
but i i mean i i have i think they should be fed and see their families and laugh </s>
mhm ah well i have to agree with that part breath </s>
yeah yeah </s>
about the ones who are in there for the next oh thousand years or so well maybe take some of those quote unquote privileges away </s>
yeah yeah stop putting manson on tv </s>
mhm </s>
to say those crazy things that he says and uh stop giving him the publicity that he always wanted </s>
that is true </s>
take away some of that stuff get put him to work oh no i kind of think if there was a way that they could put them in our offices and maybe chain gang them there and have them type on the computer and do that while i sit at home </s>
okay </s>
if there was some sort of way i think that everyday i wish somebody else could do this for me but </s>
yeah </s>
i guess it would be hard to control </s>
a lot of people um i am sure you know might know someone or even have someone in your family who um abused drugs and i see how it destroy them and i do not have any sympathy </s>
oh sure yeah i mean </s>
for these people who distribute drugs or or you know any kind of dealing with them you know like i i </s>
no not me too i i totally feel that the the ah the sentencing in most states are are pretty fair for that because mostly people who who uh distribute the drugs do not do not realize what they are doing to the you know what i mean they are just thinking of of profit they are not really thinking of the the consequences </s>
right they think that um the only affect that it is having is with that individual who they are selling them to well it goes a lot further than that you know breath you know </s>
yeah sure absolutely </s>
that individual might have a family or children or or whatever and i have seen people lose a lot i have seen them lose a lot you know breath um now i </s>
it is it is funny too because uh i know personally growing up you e people just have the wrong atti like i do not know just growing up as a </s>
cough </s>
as a chi like as as a youth like in my teenage years i i realized that uh a lot of kids had the wrong were not educated were like you know what i mean were not educated on on the drugs and and what they did to them most a lot of the kids thought that did not have an affect with marijuana did not have any affect to them it was all natural and </s>
uh-huh well </s>
so i definitely i definitely feel education is key and they they should educate the athletes as well </s>
yeah that is that is true right because a lot of them breath you know they up there in the big time making the big dollar and everything and a lot of them breath </s>
sure yeah </s>
are not as educated as people would think they are you know </s>
as </s>
um because nowadays you know you can breeze through college you know and you know just like breezing through elementary school and then come out dumb breath you know you got some people who went to college who are dumb you know and </s>
uh it amazes me i uh that is that is the truth too it is amazing how many majors there are at school and how many people i mean the the classes are just some of the majors are just a joke </s>
cough right right right </s>
and n so </s>
breath i i can remember i am i am forty nine years old but the drug the drug of choice in my days when i was going to school people were sniffing glue and drinking robitussin you know breath laugh </s>
oh sure yeah uh what </s>
breath and </s>
i am in my twent mid twenties and um eh marijuana for me for personally for people growing up around me and but but </s>
uh-huh </s>
eh it is still i mean eh no one really knew that like no one even thought about what it would do like people just live for the moment and did not even think about the consequences so </s>
right right right breath and you know a lot of people you know are ignorant to the fact that they think that drug cough excuse me breath drugs is like breath a poor man's high and you know but look at all the um prominent people you have that um are hooked on drugs and and they breath they hiding behind </s>
oh sure </s>
you know breath and uh it is it is just it is just a shame i do not know if it is ever going to be cleaned up or to what extent it is going to fully get to but i know it is it is it is rough out here with it </s>
breath though that is that is a big stereotype that that people have uh the idea that it is that definitely it is uh i mean i it should be eh people should think it is the weaker person who you know do it is the weak minded who who do the drugs not the poorer or richer cause poor rich middle class it does not matter they all everyone does them </s>
all you know you got them all hooked on it and you know like you say poor rich or whatever you know uh somebody out of every category is is hooked on them you know breath </s>
absolutely absolutely </s>
and i i just would really like to know breath what drives them to that you know uh stress or </s>
breath well that why i like that is what i said it is just that i mean people just think there is no way out i guess i do not know i </s>
you know </s>
i mean everyone gets depressed or or stressed at times but it is just it eh some people does i guess do not want to deal with it and they just to find the the easy way out and and i do not know </s>
cough right </s>
i guess for athletes too they i mean it is probably very stressed for athlete i mean we all we all think they have it made and and they have you know they are making millions of dollars which they are making tons of money but it it its got to be tough too not being able to go out of your house and and having everyone recognize you and not living a normal life so i bet you a lot of them that is how they by a lot of them do a lot of drugs and a lot of them probably do a lot of drugs just to to uh like steroid kind of drugs that you know </s>
uh-huh </s>
to help them physically </s>
right right breath and to be with the in crowd to huh </s>
but </s>
you right </s>
you yeah you just yeah i asked her too that that is the truth too breath you just got to got to have a strong head i think a lot of it comes with upbringing and and you just got to have a strong eh mainly education to realize what it does to you </s>
right right yeah breath yeah i would i would put that on the line with aids they need to um educate them more </s>
yeah sure </s>
you know yeah yeah because um you know it just tears you up you know it tears you up and it affects everybody </s>
and and it and it takes like it takes like i do not know for i mean probably for what what i have heard from you already like it takes something like for me anyway it it takes like somebody y you know personally getting it it takes like a personal loss to somebody to realize it most time i mean like a friend getting in an accident or i mean people do not realize til til there is something sad that goes on it is a shame people do not realize it to you know what i mean before something bad happens </s>
you know what i mean before that right right right </s>
but i mean everyone has to learn on their own the hard way </s>
yeah well they say that is the best teacher but sometime its too late you know </s>
mhm </s>
the parents do not discipline the kids they get away with it at home and they go take it out in the streets and the schools and they get away with it in there </s>
yeah i i think that is true um if i knew what it would be be it is a the biggest problem but it is definitely a big part of it to just um like it is lack of respect breath um </s>
yeah kids do not do the homework anymore </s>
mhm </s>
and that is a and ah well the teachers are not allowed to punish them </s>
mhm i also think um </s>
and </s>
some teachers i have i have heard a lot about teachers not being qualified to teach they can not find um very good teachers any i do not know </s>
yeah yeah that is a that is a small reason i think </s>
mhm </s>
i think if a kid wants to learn he he can stay home and read if he wants to learn he do not need the teacher he has got to have the initiative to do that </s>
yeah that is true </s>
i mean eh teacher helps but if he help if he can keep you in line or she can keep you in line there is nothing anybody could do </s>
mhm </s>
you got to take it for yourself </s>
yeah that is true breath i guess it is um breath most of the students and teacher laugh problems with that how about the set up of the school do you think there is anything wrong with that </s>
no i did not mean </s>
how they are run </s>
what do you mean s setup </s>
um say how the funds are allocated for schools </s>
well we do not we do not know too m they do not let us know too much about that </s>
laugh </s>
you know i mean ah </s>
yeah i guess so </s>
we do not know too much about that </s>
laugh </s>
no or what they do with the money </s>
mhm </s>
and then i do not think they going to tell us too much </s>
laugh they keep it a secret laugh </s>
mhm </s>

well you should have a a knowledge you know d of the not s knowledge is closest but but there is something to do with the schools like university city are you a student out there </s>
breath yeah yeah </s>
 </s>
i have i mean i comparing the school that i went to to a school that i tutored in in west philadelphia i there is such a great difference just in breath what the teachers </s>
hm </s>
expect the kids to do breath how the students behave breath i mean i i could not see getting away with what these kids were able to in west philadelphia in the school that i went to in the suburbs breath it is just </s>
that is different in the suburbs they </s>
yeah </s>
they got a you know the kids got a little disci discipline out there </s>
mhm </s>
i went to catholic school </s>
uh-huh how </s>
and i i am i went fifty years ago and we had all nuns and they kept you in line </s>
laugh </s>
no </s>
yeah i </s>
you did not dare eh give them any stuff </s>
excuse me </s>
you did not give them any lip if they said jump you said how high you know </s>
laugh yeah i mean uh our our teachers were more strict th than what i noticed in th </s>
hm </s>
the other the inner city schools but i think um they have become much more lax teachers just do not know how to deal with breath with the disruptive students anymore </s>
mhm and with me in catholic school if the nun eh punished you or did that tell you to do something you went home and told your parents you got another punishment </s>
laugh </s>
you did not dare tell them </s>
yeah i know breath you were never right laugh </s>
that is right in their eyes the nuns were hundred percent right </s>
mhm breath </s>
you know so you just took your punishment from the nun and shut up </s>
laugh </s>
why get another why get another punishment at home </s>
yeah that is true breath </s>
i think the lack of discipline though is the main thing </s>
no that is that is definitely a big part of it </s>
so we're so we're supposed to discuss whether we think that what we think about the strike </s>
what what do you feel about the the salaries of the which players right now </s>
uh-huh what do i feel about salary </s>
the salaries </s>
uh-huh </s>
the salaries about the recent strike </s>
oh well i think that they deserve their salary i think they work hard for it i mean you know um they play hard they injure their self a lot and you know um i don't know what do you think </s>
well i feel the same way i feel that they deserved the salaries because they you know that's their career </s>
uh-huh </s>
you know that's their career that's what they're doing for a living and if they do injure themselves and you know they jeopardize their career for the rest of their life then they really need something to fall back on </s>
that's right </s>
even though they're paid that large amount of money </s>
mhm </s>
for breath you know five six years </s>
mhm </s>
um actually that's a life-span for them </s>
right </s>
you know because playing that sport is uh is their career </s>
sure is </s>
but you know also behind all that i feel that because they get paid that large salary and because they have a lot of um of viewers watching them or whatever </s>
uh-huh </s>
i really think that even though a lot of them think that they they they're not role models i really think that they should portray themselves as role models </s>
right mhm </s>
simply because i mean if it weren't for the fans um looking at the sports then sports wouldn't be as popular </s>
right and they wouldn't be making any money laugh </s>
right right right right breath </s>
uh-huh so so don't you think that </s>
so </s>
some of them shouldn't be so outrageous um like um oh gosh i can't remember that guy's name the one that has his hair dyed all different colors and </s>
oh dennis rodman </s>
yeah </s>
dennis rodman breath now </s>
uh-huh </s>
i know right here in philadelphia they were just recently talking on the news um monday i heard where they were going to have a dress code um for the players that and this this is not professional players but these are potential candidates for you know you know football or whatever </s>
uh-huh </s>
that's what they were saying that they were going to have a dress code for all of them they all were going to have to wear their hair cut you know just a natural haircut no breath dreadlocks or cornrows or you know bald heads or anything like that no ear-piercing </s>
no ear-piercing </s>
um yeah and all that stuff </s>
oh </s>
and they were asking you know the public what did they feel about that </s>
uh-huh </s>
um you know i i don't really see anything wrong with them being just trying to um be themselves or you know just be different </s>
right </s>
because that's what teenagers do they want to be different you know </s>
well yeah i i think um that individuality is good but i think he just carries it too far </s>
yeah yeah now he carries it too far </s>
i mean you know </s>
he carries it too far </s>
laugh </s>
and especially with the public but you know i really think he's doing it to make extra bucks because you know if he didn't do that if he was just a plain ordinary joe breath um i don't think </s>
uh-huh </s>
you know that all these extras that he gets </s>
uh-huh </s>
you know like breath um just being in commercials or being in the newspaper or you know always being in the public eye </s>
uh-huh </s>
that would happen i think he's a um publicity seeker you know he wants people </s>
oh okay </s>
you know to notice him </s>
uh-huh some of them do get noticed anyway and get all that without being too uh outrageous </s>
right i </s>
uh </s>
i think they should do it in a positive way you know like go out and visit children's hospitals um </s>
yeah </s>
you know do things for people in the community they want to be recognized </s>
uh-huh </s>
you know be re recognized in a in a positive way </s>
uh-huh and the elderly and maybe donate </s>
right </s>
some money some of that money they make i mean they can write if off anyway so </s>
right you know </s>
you know laugh </s>
right instead of having their hair you know dyed the color of the flags and breath </s>
rainbow colors yeah laugh the color of the flag i haven't seen that one yet laugh </s>
right laugh </s>
oh man i know </s>
but it's just some of the things that i see that that happens with these athletes </s>
uh-huh </s>
that you know they do and then you know they get angry when the public comes in and says you know well breath you know you should be a role model for our children </s>
right </s>
and they say well you know i'm not a role model i get paid to do my job but i feel as though we the public are actually giving them their pay </s>
that's right and the children are looking up to them </s>
you know primarily </s>
so and the children are </s>
no </s>
emulating what they see </s>
that's right that's right </s>
so if you see kids walking around with rainbow colored hair or </s>
laugh </s>
uh their faces pierced and uh laugh </s>
right and the incident with charles barkley </s>
and whatever </s>
i think it was last year when he he spit at somebody in the audience </s>
oh no </s>
and it hit the little girl </s>
uh-huh </s>
i thought that was i mean it really turned me against charles barkley because he did that you know how could he do that th that and it landed on a child </s>
uh-huh uh-huh </s>

lipsmack yeah </s>

yeah </s>

what they built and my big my biggest question is how the heck did they build th the pyramids i mean how could you carry such big stones and stuff breath </s>
well uh breath there was um on pbs public television um breath there recent recently was a </s>
mhm </s>
series called secrets of lost empires breath were ah some masons and architects got together to try to build a small pyramid lipsmack </s>
uh-huh mhm oh just manually not no machinery or anything </s>
um using using well using ancient egyptian technology breath uh you know and they were they were able to do it </s>
oh okay </s>
breath although uh breath they had not laid it out as well as the egyptians did you know um </s>
yeah yeah </s>
so it was not like as perfect but </s>
mhm they got they got the jist of it though of how it was made yeah i mean obvi </s>
uh yeah i mean it is possible you know it it just breath it just takes a lot of work a lot of human power </s>
mhm laugh oh definitely that has to take a lot </s>
breath yeah </s>
yeah well i am standing outside with my mates while they are on cigarette break laugh </s>
oh you work for omnipoint too </s>
i am sorry what is that </s>
do you do you work for omnipoint </s>
no no </s>
oh okay </s>
i wo no i are all participants here in philadelphia do you know </s>
what was that </s>
are all the participants in this area do you know </s>
um no i am down in um allentown </s>
oh okay i ju i was wondering if most people were from philly </s>
yeah </s>
have not spoken to anyone outside philly yet </s>
really because um i work for omnipoint and it is like the whole company is in on this </s>
oh really </s>
so i can not tell you how many times i have talked to someone and they are right outside on the next floor yeah </s>
oh yeah have you actually talked to someone you know </s>
um only once </s>
yeah </s>
yeah i actually talked to a girl like at you know in the same department you know </s>
mhm </s>
i know her very um casually but you did not catch that topic huh all i know was about </s>
breath no </s>
i do not know if they were going to talk about tuition or what </s>
uh </s>
i guess it does not matter </s>
no i i do not suppose it matters </s>
i hope not this is the first time i did not catch it laugh it is like breath </s>
yeah breath so it you said you work for omnipoint </s>
yeah </s>
is omnipoint involved with the study they are doing </s>
no </s>
laugh </s>
no laugh um it is just breath i honestly do not know how um we got involved it was just word of mouth and before you knew it everybody was calling and doing it </s>
yeah </s>
so it is pretty neat </s>
breath i can not imagine what they are using this information for it is pretty wild breath </s>
oh um it is for um computer ac voice activated products </s>
really </s>
yeah um because you know tech of course our technologies growing and growing more each day breath but that is </s>
mhm </s>
that is really what it is that is why they want to know if you are outside or indoors </s>
okay </s>
and um they give you all these breath you know wacky topics they do not really care what you talk about breath </s>
mhm </s>
but that is basically what it is for because um breath the computers are go are going to be coming out they are going to be voice activated also </s>
oh the computers will be voice activated </s>
laugh </s>
laugh </s>
laugh so that will be really neat laugh </s>
breath yeah breath </s>
breath i can see it is not working laugh people yelling you know breath </s>
laugh breath mhm </s>
and then you know a lot of stuff at home at in the homes already voice activated like the garage openers and stuff like that </s>
yeah breath </s>
so that is basically what they are doing they are trying to you know refine it laugh because it is </s>
breath </s>
pretty clumsy as it is now </s>
yeah well that sounds like something like something omnipoint could use some that research </s>
laugh yeah but omnip laugh that is true breath </s>
laugh with the phones laugh breath laugh </s>
and you know i think the reason why breath they probably got us involved is because we all have our own handsets the company gives it to us </s>
oh okay yeah </s>
so you know it is </s>
that makes sense </s>
it is the perfect you know place to to get involved with with the uh study because they want you to be on you know on a cell phone or </s>
mhm </s>
breath you know at home whatever but so we all have pcs we walk around all days you know with our handsets </s>
mhm </s>
so it is convenient for us </s>
yeah so i guess the boss does not mind everyone chatting on the phone all day laugh </s>
exactly laugh as long as you know breath it is on your break or whatever breath it is it is strange when i first started working here everybody w was walking around with the handsets just talking breath </s>
mhm </s>
and i was just so not accustomed to that they are oh my god look at these people they are nuts </s>
yeah </s>
and guess what within a couple of weeks you are doing the same thing </s>
mhm laugh </s>
you know laugh </s>
well i guess you might could fake it and talk to a mate or something on the phone laugh </s>
laugh </s>
laugh pretend you are participating in a study laugh </s>
breath laugh </s>
laugh </s>
laugh </s>
laugh </s>
breath i think it is nice you know you wa we even got like i got some of my family members involved </s>
oh really </s>
you know those yeah those who had handsets </s>
mhm yeah </s>
they are they are participating in the study too since like wow that is not bad </s>
mhm </s>
you know twelve bucks a shot </s>
hm yeah that is pretty good </s>
easy mon laugh </s>
laugh it is laugh </s>
i mean we are not going to become rich but that is cool laugh </s>
yeah well i am a starving student so i could use that twelve bucks </s>
that is right laugh </s>
laugh </s>
laugh </s>
laugh </s>
my son is also um participating in the study </s>
mhm breath </s>
so um he says the same thing he will take it where ever he can laugh </s>
yeah laugh </s>
breath laugh no shame in his game you know </s>
right right laugh </s>
breath that is cute what school do you go to out in philly </s>
i go to penn university of pennsylvania </s>
oh you go to lipsmack oh great </s>
yeah yeah they had fliers up all over the place for this study and i figured you know at least buy me lunch a few days a week laugh </s>
laugh </s>
laugh yeah laugh </s>
pay for some gas breath twelve dollars you could use twelve dollars you know laugh </s>
yeah laugh </s>
they add up and um we really thought that the study would be over by now because so many of us were doing it breath and but we keep getting e-mails you know </s>
mhm </s>
they are extending it they are extending it </s>
oh really </s>
so i am like fine mhm </s>
mhm </s>
they do not have as many calls as they expected </s>
eh i guess some people are reluctant to let someone record their conversation i do not know </s>
breath i could see if we were talking about personal stuff like if we knew each other and we were really having a personal you know then i i would not </s>
yeah </s>
never participate like let us say it was breath if it was tapping my home phone i would be like </s>
oh </s>
you are nuts laugh </s>
yeah laugh </s>
breath but this i do not care laugh breath you know </s>
uh a group of men found them with these two girls two young girls breath and they thought he killed them </s>

uh listening to the comments of all the people around you and all the things that happen in a in a movie </s>
right </s>
uh that you go to see </s>

yeah breath now what if it was i am trying to think another type of perjury though like not just that the car incident it could have been something hm i am trying to think of a but yeah like you said it does that does change things once once you start changing the whole scenario it starts to change wow hm breath really make you really use your brain i tell you hm trying to </s>
so what you know breath i guess it would not even be going to court if it were not serious you know what i mean </s>

h how is philadelphia doing i was wondering i i was writing a letter to the editor and i i wanted to say that philadelphia has pretty much remained stagnant for the last during the ridge administration </s>
yeah yeah </s>
do you think it has grown any with the uh economic boom that this country seems to be going through </s>
no mhm no i would say not in fact i would say that uh in fact i would say breath that throughout ridge's administration and rendell's really there is been more people actually leaving the city i you know that that trend has actually kept up which is unfortunate </s>
yeah </s>
because ah i do not know anything that rendell could come up with as far as trying to make the city attractive and stuff it is all tourist stuff you know what i mean it is not </s>
you know i </s>
it is not so much about keeping our exact neighborhood like the neighborhoods we live in </s>
i worked in </s>
it is not so much about keeping them up and uh making sure that the residents are taken care of and then make them want to stay which i do not really understand </s>
yeah i worked in philadelphia and new york city and philadelphia is just so boring you know there is like like </s>
yeah </s>
the uh like the the china town section </s>
you are right </s>
it is two blocks long you know </s>
right </s>
and that is it and it is it is really like an alley you know </s>
right when did you when did you uh work here </s>
and it is no ah i think it was about f four years ago three years ago was the last time i worked there </s>
yeah uh-huh </s>
but when i worked in new york city breath there was i mean there was just no end to what you can do in new york city you know </s>
yeah well it is definitely two different cultures i mean philadelphia is way more slow pace and laid back and you know for a northeast city i guess way more ah and that is what i mean that is the thing i think ne eh philadelphia is more neighborhood based you know what i mean it is more about like </s>
 </s>
what section you are from and where you are at </s>
 </s>
and so like i do not know it just does not make sense to be trying to </s>
breath </s>
especially when we are so close to new york city with all the stuff that they had to do there i mean like i do not know why </s>
breath </s>
the focus is so much on downtown and trying to make it into like being like oh wow we have a hard rock cafe you know like like we did not have access to that before kind of thing you know what i am saying like breath i just think that that they should pour more into like </s>
right </s>
where we all actually live laugh </s>
yeah i do not have any ideas as to what they should do because i do not know </s>
laugh </s>
but i know they should do something alright </s>
yeah </s>
and it does it does not seem like they are doing anything </s>
not so much </s>
it is yeah it is a big town you know and uh i think </s>
yeah </s>
the only thing ridge has done is really get rid of tho the ship building plant you know laugh </s>
right </s>
wh what was that just a couple hundred million dollars a year laugh </s>
something like that </s>
yeah </s>
yeah we eh i do not know and we just of course we got a new mayor so i am interested in seeing how all that is going to pan out this will mean the ridge rendell thing did not really do much for us i do not think </s>
yeah </s>
and i think that uh and then we will see what mayor street has up his sleeve whether he is going to be helpful at all or if he is just going to he is all talk too which you know </s>
well i </s>
yeah </s>
eighth grade </s>
uh-huh </s>
he is going to start high school next year </s>
uh-huh </s>
the other one is still in third grade </s>
oh yeah yeah difference </s>
so uh even though there is only three years difference in their ages there is like five years difference in their in what year of school they are in breath i do not know i i think uh </s>
r </s>
i would rather that they teach it in the school because uh </s>
yeah it is </s>
it it is it is a little extra input i mean you know i do not actually talk to them that much about it myself but my wife does </s>
yeah well </s>
cover those topics when those questions come up </s>
yeah well it is like a classroom atmosphere and it is like another subject to them you know maybe you know breath and they might feel funny asking their parents questions where maybe they would not feel so funny asking a teacher breath you know </s>
yeah yeah </s>
but um uh i do not know when i was growing up my parents well we they never told us laugh anything at all laugh </s>
that is true that happened to me too yeah i did not hear a thing from my parents </s>
laugh </s>
and and when i was in school i i remember was uh fifth sixth grade sixth grade they showed a film or two i think in seventh grade they might have shown a film lipsmack and they had the discussion periods after the film </s>
oh yeah </s>
and uh i remember uh the one kid one kid i mean nobody else had the nerve to ask this question </s>
laugh </s>
breath but this one kid asked the question you know well how does the sperm get into the woman's vagina </s>
laugh </s>
breath and none of us knew you know because and the fifth grade teacher had to stand there and explain it </s>
breath oh my gosh uh </s>
i know and uh every what jaws dropped all over laugh the room </s>
oh laugh </s>
laugh laugh no laugh </s>
laugh i would not want to be that teacher for all the money in the world breath </s>
breath laugh cough breath he was he was sweating i remember you know the look on his face wow breath </s>
oh oh god oh yeah </s>
lipsmack but uh i guess it is easier now i do not know with all the i mean the thing is that </s>
breath well </s>
if they do not get it in the schools and they do not get it at home they certainly get it on tv </s>
well we used to talk to each other about stuff you know but we r really never really knew too much you know </s>
yeah </s>
but eh i do not i do not i still do not know a lot of stuff laugh </s>
laugh a lot of it is guesswork yeah </s>
breath five kids later you would think i would know something but laugh </s>
laugh </s>
breath </s>
breath </s>
but eh i it is uh it is har i guess ah you should sit the kids down and ask them if they have breath any questions and you know go from there and something like that and </s>
oh yeah but it is it is so awkward though i mean you know </s>
breath it really is yeah it is very awkward yeah </s>
i mean certainly when they come up with the if they if they have you know if they are comfortable enough that they come up with the que questions themselves </s>
yeah </s>
you know they are going to sit there and they are going to ask you well how does this happen or what does that </s>
yeah </s>
and what does that mean and stuff like that </s>
yeah </s>
and uh there that is not so that is not so hard i mean i can deal with that </s>
yeah yeah or maybe give them a book you know from the library </s>
but oh </s>
something like that might be good you know something that </s>
yeah yeah yeah </s>
breath they can read and if then if they have any questions you know uh breath it is so i do not know laugh breath </s>
yeah </s>
but um i do not know eh what the breath schools are teaching them uh you know really </s>
yeah that that is the thing you do not really know what what they are i mean you you have got to assume that they are not going to do anything stupid and they are not going to say anything that breath </s>
right </s>
that are going to you know get the kids pointed in the wrong direction or whatever but </s>
yeah they would not do that but eh y you would they do not actually come home and say guess what we learned in school laugh today on a subject like that you know </s>
lipsmack that is that is true yeah yeah </s>
so um but i think they are the kids are more open the kids are smart today i think they they are open to everything and they you know if they have questions like i think they i think they are pretty much eh want to know and they ask and you know they are they are i i do not think they are breath like as quiet about it as we used to be you know </s>
oh yeah that is for sure </s>
they they uh just come right out and ask you stuff and </s>
yeah </s>
breath but um i do not know it depends on the child and breath you know all that kind of stuff eh what you are going s you know </s>
yeah </s>
breath how they are going to react to it you know everybody is different breath and you know s if you go sitting a child down and say and well i am going to teach you this </s>
yeah </s>
today and it is like oh my god all i wanted to know was how to butter the bread </s>
well yeah cough </s>
you know laugh breath </s>
laugh </s>
it is like oh god what did i get myself into you know </s>
breath yeah that is that is uh </s>
breath so </s>
well yeah that is a very that is a very good point that each one is different </s>
yeah </s>
you know and you have to wonder if you put a bunch of them like thirty of them together in a room </s>
yeah </s>
and try to get these points across to them all you know </s>
yeah </s>
well they are all going to take it a little different you know </s>
that is you are right yeah that is right yeah </s>

mhm mhm </s>
breath and if you had if you took your hand from one direction to another direction we would be we would be considered the um th the fingernail part and anytime um aliens could have stopped on our body a a as a time frame and you wou we would probably would never have been there at the time another possibility is the relativity um if you look at it you know we could be um they could be real small where are eyes are not able to pick it up or or or vice versa where they might be so big and we might be so small </s>
right </s>
another another possibility that i was contemplating was um um they actually might have came but doi um but you know we look at intelligence as human we look at people as intelligence as a creature breath they might might not be intelligent like what we are thinking as being as like a creature they might be like amoeba and it might be from another you know another country and stuff another you n galaxy and everything like that </s>

i i do not know i do not think they should though i mean not that i would do it but i mean there is freedom of speech </s>
mhm right exactly </s>
that is what i think i do not know it is just it seems a bit harsh i mean you should be able to </s>
cough </s>
um express yourself </s>
right right </s>
so </s>
yeah i i guess i feel the same way you do i mean ah i f you know i i would never i can not ever imagine myself getting getting angry or you know upset enough to want to burn the american flag but um on the other hand if somebody else wants to do it you know that is fine i i wan i do not want to it laugh </s>
right but i mean it is like ah pro-choice and pro-life </s>
yeah exactly i mean </s>
i am i am pro-life as far as i am concerned because i i just could not see doing that but i am pro-choice because i think every every woman has a right to choose so laugh breath </s>
to make your own decision right right </s>
yeah </s>
yeah and i guess in a democracy you know if you do not um if you do not let people do things that you think are silly like burn the flag then then maybe some freedom of yours might not be allowed either </s>
well that is true i mean so i if if we are a democratic society then that should not that it should be encouraged but by all means if that is how you feel i mean laugh who am i to say right </s>
right right </s>
are you originally from philadelphia </s>
breath yeah i actually grew up in south philadelphia and i live out in the suburbs now </s>

so you commute to um how long is the commute </s>
breath it is um it is not that far although it is kind of slow because the trolleys that we take are you know they run like every half hour </s>
that is neat though a trolley laugh </s>
so if you do not yeah it is kind of if you do not catch it just right then you get to wait for you know up to half hour until the next one comes </s>
oh yeah that is pretty bad though laugh breath </s>
so are you living up i am sorry go ahead </s>
we live in the poconos </s>
oh really </s>
yeah yeah </s>

what am i studying um i actually study uh two things um linguistics and computing </s>
oh oh so this is right in your league there </s>

laugh </s>
you know whether you are male or female or you know what area of the country you come from that kind of stuff </s>
right your culture yeah </s>

yeah can you guess where i am well i told you i am from new york but </s>
uh-huh </s>
nobody could ever decipher my accent they are like where are you from i mean what </s>
really </s>
i guess because of the way i look and i speak differently i do not know </s>
so people do not know that you are they do not know you are from new york breath </s>
and um yeah i like it because it is it is very informative you here everything </s>
i got to admit as i get older i become less and less interested in the news </s>
yeah you do not </s>
because it seems like you hear the same thing laugh </s>
i know and there is so much bad news going on nowadays you know it is ah y you would like to here some good news for a change </s>
oh i do not know it has probably always been bad news it was just i i had not heard it before you know ten years ago maybe </s>
yeah that is true yeah i i think a lot of that eh is lot lot of the younger people are really getting involved in bad stuff that is what i think it is </s>
i guess come to think of it i do get some information because at the office we have email </s>
uh-huh </s>
cough and i i am on this west philly list and i find out like i guess mayor street was here a week ago or something i found out about that of course i did not go but i knew he was here breath </s>

no actually i work in west philly i work at the university </s>
oh okay you work at the university </s>
yeah so </s>

yeah yeah </s>
the train yeah well i i drive down there and i put my car in the parking lot and then i take the uh el all the way into center city at fifteenth and market and then i just walk eh about two blocks to where i work so it is it is convenient </s>
i got to admit that it uh transport here is actually very good but it seems kind of expensive because i we came from dc </s>
it is uh-huh </s>
and the metro although is eh metro seems very expensive it is subsidized by all the tax payers so it is not as expensive as it as it probably should be </s>
yeah well see i buy tokens per ah by the week i buy buy ten tokens and it costs me eleven fifty for ten so in other words i use two a day one going to work one coming back so i guess you could say it is kind of expensive but then if you take the other train it it is i think twenty-four fifty a week that is what the other people pay when they take the better class train laugh i i guess you could call it </s>
laugh </s>
yeah the more luxury liner i guess you would call it </s>
breath and uh the trains here there is the trolleys which i ride and then there is also the high speed trains </s>

yeah yeah it used to last for like three hours and now it lasts for like twenty minutes </s>
yeah i find that my charge does not last quite as long as it used to </s>
huh but it is still the same battery as the the the w when you first got it oh yeah </s>
right yeah it is the same battery yeah i have been thinking about getting another one just to keep the life in my phone a little but cause the phone itself is in great shape i mean breath </s>
that is rough yeah oh that is good yeah breath yeah my lap top is okay i mean i had to switch out a um cd rom drive or something a and uh breath but at this point you know it is three years old and </s>
which is </s>
and lap tops now are so much better breath that it is like well by the time the battery wears out it is time to get a new lap top you know laugh </s>
oh yeah technology the technology has changed so much yeah breath laugh well i know like with my phone it like cheaper to get another phone than it is to change the battery breath </s>
breath yeah yeah yeah oh my god you are kidding breath laugh i had no idea </s>
laugh breath you know breath buy another phone for less </s>
wow yeah yeah that it is it is cheaper to change phones than it is to change batteries huh breath </s>
yeah well uh the phone that i have is has actually been discontinued </s>
oh </s>
so i am trying to hold on to it for all i can because it is a really great phone and i do not want to replace it with something totally different </s>
yeah that is an interesting thing that same thing again it is the same thing that happens only you know going back to lap tops uh breath i when i bought this lap top it was like brand new breath and i was trying to mount you know i was trying to put in a </s>
mhm </s>
a different operating system once i got it and it was a problem because it was so new the hardware on it was so new that the ah it was hard to get like all the drivers or whatever i needed to to make it work with the new operating system breath and it is like if i wanted to get uh something that was that is like well known and that has been around awhile and everybody has tried it out and they recommend it and all breath and i go to buy something and i can not get it because they do not make those anymore </s>
yeah </s>
and and it is like i mean i do not even know what ah the stuff on the cell phones are that that um that they change all the time breath but um i am i am sure it happens </s>
lipsmack oh absolutely it happens yeah the features and they get easier to use and that sort of thing they get smaller and lighter </s>
maybe yeah but then again i mean i do not know i mean it make they get a lot easier to lose laugh </s>
yeah yeah breath well if you think back you know like ten fifteen years ago when you first started seeing cell phones those bag phones that they had in cars </s>
breath oh it was like an extra suitcase or something right yeah breath yeah </s>
yeah those huge horrible things breath laugh and now they make them they are as small as a pager </s>
yeah i i kind of remember seeing the guys at at the airport with those init those first ah version portable phones breath and it was like </s>
mhm </s>
you know yeah it was like extra baggage you know laugh breath i do not know how much they must they must have weighed a ton </s>
oh yeah they were huge breath laugh they were like hard wired into your car or laugh </s>
yeah yeah it is like once you are in there you are stuck with it yeah </s>
yeah laugh breath </s>
but anyway so how is it working for omnipoint do you have are they good employers </s>
oh yeah yeah it is definitely the best place i have ever worked i mean </s>
wow great </s>
i i like it very much </s>
breath i did not um wait a minute there is um some kind of a merger or something going on with them </s>
breath yes yes um we are going through a merger right now with voicestream </s>
yeah </s>
um they are from out west basically </s>
breath oh okay yeah </s>
uh they they expected to close by the end of this month actually the fcc just approved the merger yesterday </s>
breath ah oh wow </s>
so it is just a matter of some some paperwork being signed i believe and breath everything should final by the end of the month </s>
i see so do are they keeping you pretty well informed about this or do you just have to watch the newspapers </s>
well laugh breath it is getting better now that we are getting closer it is getting better um it was really bad breath </s>
laugh breath it is getting better breath uh-huh wow breath all you </s>
it was like a word of mouth thing like people that we talked to you know our customers seemed to know more than we did for awhile there breath laugh </s>
laugh breath yeah yeah you got all the stock traders that are just ready to pounce right </s>
it is something that is do you think it is insulting </s>
i do not know if it is insulting but i just think that you know you are you are american and you should you know respect that you know some of somebody's father you know fought you know to get the freedom or even your brother might have gone been over there and died for that you know what i mean for the american flag and it might just be a symbolized thing but you know what i mean </s>
mhm lipsmack do you think it still has an affect on uh on the public uh sort of morale </s>
yeah </s>
yeah right right hm </s>
what do you think </s>
lipsmack lipsmack um i think i do not think it should be encouraged </s>
mhm </s>
breath um but i think that it is an expression of breath of of uh of a sentiment um and i think that is part i think that would be one of the freedoms that is allowed in this country um i do not think it should be penalized to that extent breath um </s>
mhm </s>
lipsmack but i certainly think it should be discouraged i do not think that people should ah i think it should be um emphasized that it is not something that should be breath encouraged and </s>
mhm </s>
but i think that it is a right breath um but i would not go out and tell everyone to do it laugh </s>
yeah </s>
breath but i think when that happens there is it is it is a sign that something is needs to be addressed </s>
mhm </s>
and if people respect it they will realize and that it will not be taken lightly lipsmack but breath um so yes it is it is what i believe my my approach to that is breath yeah oh you have kids with you laugh </s>
yes laugh just got done food shopping </s>
oh really so you just got in </s>
yeah actually i just got in the parking lot laugh i was just getting ready to leave to go home laugh </s>
oh i see laugh that is funny but you are in the parking lot right now </s>
yeah </s>
laugh oh got you are you based in um </s>
no no </s>
philly pennsylvania no okay </s>
i am in the lehigh valley area not too far from philadelphia </s>
lipsmack oh okay that is not too far away that is not too far away at all breath </s>
have you done a lot of these calls </s>
breath i am breath i think that i am probably on my fourth breath or fifth breath almost almost halfway through lipsmack halfway through </s>
mhm i think this is like my fourteenth breath </s>
oh really </s>
yeah breath </s>
that is pretty good breath </s>
yeah been doing them for a while </s>
breath yeah that is great there is not that much time left though </s>
no </s>
so they say lipsmack um hm </s>
this is a hard topic to discuss i do not know they give you some hard topics that you know that you have to discuss mhm yeah mhm i never really thought too much about it because i mean i you do not hear it every day of people going out and burning the american flag you know what i mean i think it would be different if like this was happening every day then i think it would need to be something that would you know need to be addressed but it does not cough happen too often at all so i think most people you know respect the flag and what it stands for and everything and like you said you would not encourage it but i can not see them sending them to jail for you know life or anything over it because there are you know some murderers get off and mhm mhm i think there are though very yeah </s>
if i think about it even more it could go b it could go both ways i mean a low profile case depending on the per individual i mean what is what is the crime i mean who can decide i mean who can decide what is is private or what is not i mean i i think as uh in a free society we should be able to see certain things i think ev everything should not be hidden hidden from us </s>
yeah but any court case is public is a public info anyway </s>
lipsmack okay and it is public on record right that means you have you have to go back and research it </s>
yeah mhm </s>
but i mean to see it live and at the at the time that it is happening would not that be more interesting </s>
breath uh i think to me i am actually indifferent for for people's problems actually maybe that is just my own personal position i could not care less if it is televised or not yeah it makes no difference to me </s>
okay okay </s>
breath but eh one thing i do think is when it is televised it then has a tendency to prejudice or bias the judge the jury and everyone involved </s>
breath </s>
because the media can now give you a representation that makes you think oh guilty as hell or vice versa breath you know some cases get moved simply because of that media attention </s>
okay yeah they give get them off of a different venue yeah i understand they get them off a different venue which in in many cases is true because a person can get a trail a fair trial </s>
yeah </s>
um i guess i guess the main one they can speak of would be the oj case </s>
mhm </s>
in are you uh uh if you are familiar with that or know anything about that that was that was that was very high highly publicized i personally </s>
very mhm </s>
would not have um wanted to show that but i also believe that i personally believe that he was not uh that he was innocent </s>
you believe he was innocent </s>
yeah </s>
okay but now you from what the the way it was exposed they said the opposite the media was saying something else </s>
yeah y y yeah i i but i was looking at i was trying to make a i was trying to keep it was not just oj or anybody as far as the case would go i guess they i guess they really wanted to know because it was a high profile person </s>
mhm mhm breath because and here is another thing for the mere fact that it is high profile a lot of people immediately think oh he is rich he has got to be guilty </s>
breath yeah okay that is true i mean that is really uh conventionally uh hard thing to people just sort of pre-judge they do not know and you have to really look at the whole facts and then you have to say well okay look at the whole facts and what has been presented and what has not been presented </s>
mhm </s>
um the reason i say that i do not think he was guilty is because i do not think one person can kill two people real quick and get away </s>
laugh that is true but then he ha the way i believe it he had something to do with it he knows about it or somewhere along the line he was involved </s>
lipsmack oh yeah m maybe not with the physical aspect </s>
mhm </s>
but maybe it was something that was under the table or you know correlating or anything but i mean something that was uh you know that was under you know under the table that was that was happening i think that was happening uh i think a lot of a lot of the profile high profile case then how do you how </s>
mhm </s>
do you satisfy the public curiosity i mean how do how do you how do you make it fair where everyone can see i mean what do you do </s>
how do you do what </s>
breath i mean they say if they do not profile a case they do not show it how do you establish the guilt or non-guilt even if it was not a high profile case or for a high profile individual just an an average person an average everyday person that is working </s>
i mean regardless they will establish guilt or innocence whatever the case high or low profile </s>
okay but it should the the the re the guilt should be proven beyond a reasonable doubt </s>
true </s>
so uh it is um uh it it is always very very controversial </s>
yeah </s>
eh you you you know and i i would not watch wish anyone to go to prison or to be accused of anything that they did not do i think everyone deserves a fair trial you know </s>
mhm right but the media events with oj surrounding the oj case was more like he bought his way out of trouble </s>
yeah yeah that is true because he had a high profile lawyer and he had a lot of money and stuff which in fact you know however it went you know and uh ah it is really a shame laugh it is uh uh i think knowing i think the the ones who really got hurt a lot were the children </s>
mhm yeah </s>
because they had they had to go that they had to go through that and i think it was so good i do not think i would want to put my children through that i think that was so wrong and that was the main thing </s>
mhm </s>
and then and then regardless you know you have a parent who has lost a child you know their their mother is gone and uh now no one knows </s>
 </s>
so they will you know just hope that i mean like i said there is a whole lot about that case breath </s>
yeah </s>
but then if it was legalized then you wouldn't have to worry about nobody getting in trouble for it either </s>
that's right there you go </s>
an an and and there probably wouldn't be </s>
and the government huh </s>
what what were you going to say </s>
and then the government could get like a hold on it where's you know how i mean won't be all this </s>
it probably wouldn't be so bad </s>
right there you go it won't be all this madness out here </s>
exactly </s>
you know what i'm saying </s>
so maybe we should fight for legal legal legalization laugh </s>
i'm all for it laugh </s>
laugh so whe whe where you from frank </s>
i'm up at olney where you from </s>
where and where </s>
olney pennsylvania </s>
where's that at okay i'm at easton pennsylvania </s>

yeah so you know it's about this going to marijuana too </s>
but um i don't look look look breath i don't smoke marijuana so laugh </s>
no </s>
so it it wouldn't even it wouldn't affect me </s>
laugh you could care less right </s>

me me myself i it's okay </s>
as oh my /as </s>
you know what i'm saying </s>
mhm </s>
it's okay i wouldn't i e either way they do it you know what i'm saying this going to be around period </s>
mhm </s>
whether they legalize it or not they're not going to stop it from coming into this country </s>
mhm </s>
you know what i'm saying you got people growing it right in their own homes </s>
lipsmack exactly but you want to know something most people who do crimes they're not high off of marijuana </s>
no is it's crack cocaine heroin </s>
you know what i mean exactly </s>
that's the stuff you know what i'm saying </s>
exactly </s>
those are the things that they need to put a stop to </s>
exactly </s>
you know what i'm saying those are destroying families communities </s>
mhm </s>
i mean you know breath man uh i'm just talking me as an african american you know </s>
mhm </s>
it's bringing our people down some of them anyway </s>
mhm i know exactly </s>
you know i tell you some people just tear their whole family apart dealing with that stuff man </s>
i know </s>
so you know </s>
yeah marijuana g it's more like a it's a social drug right </s>
yeah you know marijuana </s>
right </s>
marijuana is like uh prozac to some folks </s>
laugh exactly </s>
you dig what i'm saying it's like a anti-depressant </s>
exa that's true laugh </s>
i'm ser i'm serious for real you know they'll you know what i'm saying they'll prescribe prozac </s>
laugh </s>
for you if you all depressed and this and that go smoke a joint </s>
mhm </s>
and i bet you you forget all about your troubles just for about that you know what i'm saying </s>
that's true </s>
for that little bit of time or whatever </s>
that's true </s>
breath and you know you'll sit down instead of panicking and getting all upset you smoke a joint sit down relax to be more calm </s>
mhm </s>
and you'll be able to deal with certain issues whereas though </s>
 </s>
if your head was straight you know you probably would have just panicked and bail out a window or something you know what i'm saying </s>
breath mhm look but listen to this </s>
uh-huh </s>
if if you had cancer or whatever and you smoke a joint how long would it actually keep take the pain away </s>
breath it would take it depends on </s>
or would you be smoking all day see that's another thing would you be smoking all day </s>
th </s>
and have your um your senses are not as um on on point </s>
well it de it depen it depends on the quality of the marijuana see you have certain classes of it breath now if you get i if you get so </s>

mhm uh-huh </s>
you know what i mean </s>
really </s>
and it's supposed to space your mind out breath but the idea for </s>
see that's that's entirely different </s>
yeah the idea for yeah that is different that's a little uh it's like a halluci uh </s>
a hallucinogen </s>
yeah yeah something that's you don't want that </s>
then that's not what you use it for </s>
you don't want that oh you don't want that angel dust either </s>
exactly </s>
breath you don't want to mess with that breath </s>
exactly </s>
but just straight marijuana i don't see no harm in it and especially for a cancer patient because once they go through that chemo breath they lose their appetite they don't want to eat they don't want to do anything breath </s>
mhm </s>
and the whole part of recovery </s>
okay </s>

yeah that is definitely true </s>
breath it it would be nice to see somebody doing something good for once uh rather than you know cop shoots someone seventy two times or this person killed four people it would be nice to see someone do something good for once </s>

unfortunately that's what sells </s>
yeah and i d i don't entirely breath i truthfully don't understand that really </s>
breath </s>

lipsmack breath </s>
experience it firsthand don't sit there and watch people breath getting swept away by a typhoon or something on tv </s>
sure it is easy for us to sit here in tv and say oh that is terrible but if you are actually there it is a completely different situation </s>
right right and that is what i mean people should go get stuff first hand none of this having to experience it uh vicariously </s>
the o the oj trial was just a a crying shame of what american society is today at least the criminal justice system </s>
yeah </s>
that is just that was just a televised version of if you have money you can literally buy your way out of anything </s>
breath that was yeah that was a little bit out of control and i was like i did not even see it like i guess you had to have cable or something to even really really watch it but i you know i don't really watch </s>

okay breath </s>
my little extra money laugh </s>

cause i actually had uh heart surgery done at the university of pennsylvania </s>
oh you did uh really where are you from then </s>
yeah i am from allentown </s>
oh alright </s>
i am from right up the road </s>
yeah so i guess yeah uh i guess i guess penn is the that would be the place to go then </s>
yeah well cough my i originally i have had this since birth breath and um yeah it is actually my third surgery </s>
oh really oh my </s>
yeah and the uh the doctor i had obviously he was a pediatric cardiologist and referred me over to this doctor at over in penn so that is where i ended up going to uh get my third and final surgery now i am now it is supposedly corrected knock on wood </s>
yeah i was gonna say we will hope it is final right </s>
yeah jesus you know i am twenty four and i have already had three heart surgeries that is fantastic </s>
yeah yeah i had a cousin like that she uh she had been going all of her whole life had a little something wrong with her heart and just was going breath she had a lot of treatment at the mayo clinic </s>
mhm </s>
out west out in the mid-west so yeah i mean it it seems like something that i mean uh probably is not exactly the same problem but that is pretty serious when you have a heart condition that you just have to keep going back for over the course of your whole life jeeze </s>
i mean it it wasn't to the point where it really bothered me taught to be normal for me i mean it was something that i have grown up with and and and deemed normal for my lifestyle it is something that you have had since birth you don't even learn to you don't realize anything different </s>
true breath right you know and then yeah that makes a lot of sense you're like so that's the way it has always been right </s>
right i mean i had an abnormal heart rhythm and now after the the surgery now i i guess i have a normal heart rhythm like everybody else and i thought i actually didn't care for it at first i didn't like it </s>
oh really </s>
no cause i i mean i was so used to having the other one it was it felt very different for me it was very strange </s>
oh that's interesting why were they so worried about that because it made you tired or w </s>
you mean what happened well i had a next the the uh i i had wolf parkinson white syndrome is what it was called i had an extra electrical conduction and what happens is it was at times it would get caught in a loop inside my heart and then would not beat out </s>
oh my </s>
um lipsmack i think that if the there would be no need for affirmative action if things were quote level on the playing field before then </s>
exactly yeah </s>
okay they would not need that and there are times when people get to certain um positions because of their gender or their race or their eth ethnicity </s>
right </s>
or and if someone else who may not have that qu uh that going for them and they may not get the deal so then now who what do you do do you spite one and help the other one somebody gain somebody loses </s>
right right </s>
i think over and all it has to be uh uh something th </s>
an even playing field like one of my brothers is adopted and he is he is black and my other brothers are white and they got into the same </s>
yeah </s>
colleges you know and in terms of jobs i think they will probably end up i do not know if they will even i do not know i just think if there was an i do not know i can not really it is hard to say like i am it is hard to say whether or not i would like as a woman if i get uh if i get into something or if i get a job because i am a woman you know what i mean </s>
well well i know um my daughter she is a manager of a job she is the manager and um it is like um and her position is that her uh for her colleagues to see her her boss is also a female and uh they tell me what they have to go to just by being a job does not matter whether whether they are black or white or blue or green breath it is just they are a woman and they have a job that is maybe traditionally would be held by a male </s>
right right so she has tougher things to go through </s>
so they have to yeah and they have other things too so breath </s>
 </s>
i think basically if a person is qualified breath they should get the job but how do you make things that has been disappropriate over the years i mean make it so active okay me me personally um </s>
right but uh yeah right right </s>
i got my job that i am working at now because of the nineteen sixty-four civil rights act </s>
right </s>
and that was and that was because of my age </s>
right </s>
i went to get a job and um because because i was qualified in spite of my age and my years </s>
right </s>
i got the job </s>
right </s>
so i felt good about that now there was someone else that may not have gotten a job because they said well they have two different lists of everything and they have quote the black list or the white list </s>
lipsmack right </s>
so i think that affirmative action lipsmack is i think it is ba it it is it is set out to be positive and as say affirmative but also it is hard to make one person satisfied </s>
right i think it is important right breath well because then it is hard when you see i mean in certain in certain areas there is </s>
and not k another person </s>
like just as many as many white children that do not grow up with i in the city or you know what i mean and just as many black children in the suburbs that grow up with good good public schools as opposed to the city public schools i mean it is like it is hard to say that it race related as opposed to as opposed to um </s>
geolo geological yeah yes you are right economics see people do not realize that breath people people are poor on both sides of the street breath i guess because sometimes they say because um they say </s>
economics you know yeah exactly </s>
well it is all all bad things happen in the city but what about in rural appalachia or virginia </s>
like appalachia exactly that is exactly what i am thinking of you are right </s>
yeah and appa yeah breath about rural appalachia the coal miners they they are they are they are really really poor breath uh i bet people have not seen poor until they have to live that type of lifestyle so for s </s>
i mean those are like poor people yeah yeah and plus like i am a nurse so in my field i am a woman and my field is all women essentially i mean there is very few men you know </s>
yeah my niece my niece she is a nurse also </s>
oh really </s>
yeah so yeah i know </s>
yeah but you do not hear about that many men that are nurses but i see i see male nurses sometimes i mean i think it is hard for them sometimes you know growing up in even in a women's field laugh working </s>
but i but i still yeah but i still think if you are qualified your gender should your gender should have nothing to do with it breath and your skin color your ethnicity even your sexual preference breath </s>
right if it yeah they right mhm </s>
should have nothing to do with it i mean if a person if a person is is is green with a with a red stripe down their back and uh t </s>
yeah you are right laugh right breath </s>
to eighteen purple pink fingernails breath if they can do the job respect people and uh treat people like human beings then there is nothing else you can say </s>
right breath and then i think that i mean i think there has to be some measure of getting kids into good colleges that they are they do not go to like the prep schools that are you know what i mean they do not go to like the prep schools that are like the private </s>
yeah i know </s>
high schools that cost ten thousand dollars a year or whatever </s>

yep you know and i eh you know if there is one other thing i would change it was my decision or or my lack of decision on whether or not to invest in in certain stocks when given the opportunity breath you know </s>

oh okay </s>
just just a regular christian </s>
okay </s>
breath and um the cool thing is that it is just breath yeah me and my people from the neighborhood we talk to the neighbors uh you know friends get together </s>
okay </s>
and it is more it is not like a um religious d debate kind of thing breath </s>
okay </s>
it is more like okay how does this apply to our lives </s>
breath right exactly </s>
more like practical how can we really be a support to one another </s>
yeah breath well </s>
um so yeah its uh its really fun </s>
that's good i mean it is just its odd cause i was sitting with uh another friend of mine yesterday i am catholic and i went to breath mass yesterday for ash wednesday for the first time in years </s>
mhm </s>
and we discussing how religion it seems or at least my religion catholicism seems to be way too strict in their rules and regulations they don't care how it wants to apply to us </s>
yeah </s>
lipsmack so uh breath i got in that kind of debate actually yesterday </s>
oh wow </s>
breath with myself against my own religion </s>
wow </s>
so i am like in that whole questioning alright is catholicism really for me or not </s>
yeah it is funny cause um like my church we meet at the um we meet a couple different places but this week we are going to be at um university city high school </s>
lipsmack oh okay uh-huh </s>
that's right at like thirty sixth and market and um </s>
okay </s>
breath but yeah i went through the same thing like really i mean i grew up baptist breath and i had a lot of questions about breath why a belief i mean more of it is just honestly because of tradition </s>
right </s>
and my family we all kind of believe the same way </s>
exactly but y have you ever questioned why </s>
but i didn't uh i just started questioning because there were some things that i really felt against </s>
uh-huh </s>
but i felt scared to say that breath because you know your whole family is a part of this </s>
right right exactly y </s>
and it is a lot of pressure like family wise it is like religion is so tied into the family </s>
uh-huh </s>
to branch out and to do your own thing can alienate me breath and um breath but what i really started thinking why did like for instance like i think about like the pope breath how did he get all that power </s>
uh right yeah and and who said he could have all that power </s>
laugh breath yeah and i thought well he doesn't know me </s>
uh-huh </s>
laugh breath and even i thought about like confessing your sins to some priest that guy doesn't know you breath he is just a man just like i am </s>
exactly breath well i mean my whole theory with the whole confession with the priest thing hold on a second i am i am merging into traffic as i cannot go alex /as </s>
hm </s>
this is a hazard that you should not talk on a cell phone while driving </s>
laugh </s>
and hopefully they passed a law making it illegal so my friend can't make me do this </s>
laugh </s>
laugh anyway so breath i was watching the news the other day and they were saying the pope made a statement about um be the church was fallible in a number of events like the holocaust and everything </s>
mhm </s>
and uh it is some big major ordeal now that he is actually admitting that the church had had sinned </s>
yeah </s>
so ah i just think it goes to show that why have we given the church all this power over our faith and our beliefs and it is ours to question </s>
yeah breath and i think for me what i did was i actually started reading the bible breath and i was it was really wild i thought man i went to a shrine but i never read the bible </s>
okay </s>
breath cause i thought well the people like the priests and stuff or the you know the pastor they are in charge of that breath and i just started reading it for myself and i saw a lot of contradictions between what the church </s>
uh-huh </s>
believed and what the bible actually taught </s>
and what the bible says right right </s>
i thought wow like i was always had a big problem like with racism i thought why do you hm why do i have friends from different races and backgrounds but we can't worship together </s>
mhm right </s>
or it is awkward </s>
it it just doesn't make any sense </s>
yeah and i i actually found the scripture that says that you know people should be able to be all like all nations should worship together </s>
mhm mhm </s>
i said get out um but the things that i started doing </s>
yeah well uh yeah and that i like that idea it is just right now i am caught between alright do i want to practice the religion i have been grown up to believe in </s>
mhm </s>
do i to question and just like you said you know the whole family thing do you want to start questioning your family's beliefs </s>
mhm breath yeah but i say mean breath um i know it is kind of weird but i would i would definitely try to come out um to this church that i go to because it is um people from all different races and backgrounds breath and their whole focus and our whole focus is really just getting back to what god wants us to believe breath </s>
right right breath and i think that is what is most important it is how your your personal relationship </s>
yeah and that is all we focus on </s>
is is what the key is okay </s>
is our personal relationship with god </s>
uh-huh </s>
and um i guess that we are going to be meeting at like um university city high school this week and the next week at sunday at ten thirty breath but mhm </s>
okay sunday ten thirty huh alright </s>
and and you can ask for me netta laugh breath </s>
okay </s>
but you would really be blown away because i have never seen a group of people really breath just devoted to their own personal relationship with god </s>
right </s>
and willing to even contradict um breath traditions that have been you know for years and years and years um i mean it is totally amazing to see blacks whites asians worship </s>
mhm </s>
together breath being family breath uh in the sense that it otherwise i mean peop poor rich breath all walks of life </s>
exactly i mean that just seems to be what would bring it together better </s>
and its yeah and it is so freeing like escaping all that tradition </s>
uh-huh yeah </s>
because i realize like so many things like for traditions were h holding you know holding me in bondage </s>
i i am driving so </s>
breath ah oh okay </s>
but i do not know do you want to start or </s>
yeah i pressed one so it is recording </s>
oh okay </s>
do you have to press one </s>
no no i do not think so </s>
oh okay alright </s>
breath no </s>
so what are you doing with yourself tonight </s>
oh we just uh came home from when we went down to atlantic city today me and a couple of my f </s>
oh good </s>
friends that were just on the way home from that and actually </s>
did </s>
just going home and seeing a movie or something </s>
did y win any money </s>
no no not at all i usually lose money but this time i broke out even </s>
eh that is not bad i was down there about </s>
so yeah </s>
three weeks ago and i broke even </s>
oh okay </s>
so </s>
 </s>
i </s>
it is not that bad like it when you go home with n not losing any money is pretty good </s>
exactly exactly </s>
so but i </s>
so what is the topic we are supposed to talk about i do not remember </s>
it was i believe um should schools and or both parents talk to kids about sex and if the schools or parents like what kind of roles schools should play in that or something like that </s>
oh okay </s>
i have actually i have actually had this topic before too so </s>
oh alright </s>
yeah i do not know </s>
so what are your thoughts on it </s>
um i do not know wi uh we talk it has been so long last i talked about it but i feel that like ah it should be a combination of both but the it should be more up to the parents i do not think that i i do not i think the schools should probably have a limited role maybe possibly this is tough this is a tough decision but the parents should definitely i think should have a </s>
okay </s>
bigger role but if parent if some parents </s>
yeah </s>
do not want to talk about it then it is always good for the schools to jump in </s>
right right no i </s>
so </s>
i guess my feeling is the parents yes should they should be educated on how they teach their children </s>
yeah </s>
and then should the ch schools want to teach it i think my opinion would be you know to ask if the schools should ask the permission of the parents </s>
you know that that is a </s>
to enroll the students in a class or something </s>
yeah that that that would be something that yeah because some exactly because some parents would not want their children being subjected to it or something so </s>
right </s>
it should be like the parental a parental like permission slip or something like that </s>
right exactly but breath you know i think the schools need to take some sort of active roll and they can not just preach abstinence without without giving the other alternatives should someone should choose not to do abstinence </s>
because i know me personally i mean my parents and me never ever talked about sex or anything like that so </s>
ah </s>
and school and school hardly ever did a good job like i mostly learned just from friends or from whatever just from i guess television friends or wherever i just picked up here and there </s>
right </s>
breath but i my parents never talked about it in school it was just </s>
right </s>
when i was in high school it was just like a health class sort of deal and they would just </s>
exactly exactly </s>
and god i do not if i got anything out of it it was just more of watching a movie and </s>
so do you right </s>
and i went to catholic school so it was </s>
do you think that h </s>
it was just horrible like they did not talk anything like open </s>
i know i went to catholic school also </s>
yeah </s>
so do you think that helped or hindered us </s>
i do not know i think i think i do not know sometimes i feel like i am lucky that nothing really happened like i did not i did not get ah like a girl pregnant or anything like that </s>
mhm right </s>
i feel like i am lucky because there has been like a lot of instance instances i th i would i look back on and i just feel that god if i was just a little bit smarter or or you just had a little more education about it it would not have been the same but </s>
uh-huh right right </s>
so i feel like i lucked out so to speak but eh yeah definitely i mean i can see how a lot of lot of kids i mean if their parents do not talk to them about it they can find themselves getting into trouble and it is because they have because of a lack of education on the topic </s>
exactly they have they have no idea what precautions to take </s>
and god i remember going through that high school it was just i think it was one class that was it </s>
and you know </s>
and one like out of the four years it was just one class </s>
right </s>
one semester and </s>
exactly and it was just like a health ed class </s>
yeah and it was yeah </s>
it was not it was not giving you any pros and cons or any other options </s>
there was always that infamous movie </s>
laugh </s>
and that was it laugh </s>
breath exactly exactly </s>
laugh </s>
breath so </s>
so yeah it is a good uh it is a good thing to talk about i know if i do not have children now but i definitely would like to do stuff like that in schools and i would definitely be more open </s>
absolutely yeah i mean and i think it it takes it takes some guts on the parents and to to broach that subject and they nowadays you have the you have to talk about the subject even earlier in the childhood because i mean we have got what </s>
yeah </s>
fifth graders sixth graders getting pregnant i have been hearing </s>
and you know i it and to me it would have been like ah i would have needed something like in eighth ninth grade because i got but like exactly you said now the times are changing and you need definitely when they are like in fifth </s>
oh absolutely </s>
fifth sixth grade that is amazing </s>
oh yeah i mean </s>
it is crazy </s>
yeah the they are starting out at younger and younger they learn about things off the television even younger and like just on the news the other day i mean there is so in they are so vulnerable and influenced by tv you got kids wrestling each other and killing each other </s>
it is it is insane i know my my mom </s>
yeah </s>
my mom has worked for uh like a place and she she has been teaching like pre-kindergarten stuff like that and some of the kids are just breath i mean you can you can totally see how the parents have like raised them because like there is one little boy he tries to run around kissing little girls and </s>
uh-huh </s>
and he is like five years old i mean that is the stuff that you you have to be taught that or you do not just pick that up on your own </s>
although i had an experience when i was little this is going to sound really corny my sister and i used to share the same bedroom you know we slept in the same bedroom breath and the one night i guess we were about she is a year older than me we were probably about nine or ten </s>
mhm </s>

yeah </s>
and she will say uh-huh you know now that is for two kids to see something like that </s>
mhm </s>
lipsmack so i do not know you know breath so yeah in a way but in my heart i am not a hundred percent sure </s>
me either </s>
you know i am sure people who have uh like a like a grandmother if it was somebody she knew and cared for </s>
mhm i believe that people that are dead can breath uh send their presence in a certain type of way maybe through somebody else or something like that </s>
mhm </s>
breath because like my grandmother's birthday was october the second </s>
mhm </s>
breath on october the second my grandmother died november lipsmack eleventh was three years breath and on oct october the second </s>
uh-huh </s>

uh-huh uh-huh </s>
breath she started coming over here she started hanging around </s>
hm </s>
um she started </s>
and you did not know her </s>
yeah i know her </s>
uh-huh </s>
she started saying a lot of things that my grandmother used to say to us </s>
uh-huh </s>
you know she sh she acted like my grandmother </s>
lipsmack oh wow </s>
she breath she do not look like her or nothing but she acted like her and she spoke like her </s>
right right oh neat i mean </s>
last month and i was telling my aunt and a couple of people about it </s>
uh-huh </s>
they was like my grandmom sent her here </s>
mhm oh that </s>
so i b i do believe stuff like that </s>
yeah you know it is still </s>
you know i believe stuff like that because i mean breath she reminded me so much of my grandmom and the way she talked and everything </s>
the way she yeah and she is just telling you she is still around </s>
yeah </s>
well that is neat that is neat </s>
yeah and breath the lady talked very highly of me she said a lot of nice things about me </s>
uh-huh </s>
breath and everything and i was like this is what grandmom think about me </s>
that is neat yeah i </s>
that is how i took it </s>
i believe that way you know </s>
you know and she stayed for a while and then all of the sudden she left and did not come back </s>
she can come back hm </s>
nope she stayed for like two or three weeks she kept coming over like two or three weeks and then breath she did not </s>
does she does she live in the area or </s>
yeah she um my um my kids cousin </s>
uh-huh </s>
um he is my kids cousin you know she real old she like seventy something </s>
okay uh-huh oh wow that is that is different breath </s>
yes seventy eighty something years old something like that </s>
yeah i believe like that you know with this haunted house stuff oh i do not know you know </s>
i do not know about that either </s>
that that laugh that is a little to me that is a little far fetched </s>
because i never really i never had a experience with nothing like that maybe with breath something like somebody coming back or something like that you know sending they presence through somebody else </s>
mhm breath sh </s>
but i do not know about no haunted house laugh </s>
i think that would that would freak me out a little bit though i think too </s>
what </s>
having a p somebody a presence come back i do not know you know i depends on who would come back you know who would and if it is somebody you really cared about </s>
yeah breath and that is somebody who i cared about who will never die in my heart </s>
that is right that is right that that is </s>
you know i always keep her alive you know </s>
mhm that is like my father passed away this past january and i think you know if if a presence came like him i would not be afraid of it you know that w it would be different </s>
mhm </s>
but if if something like if you felt an evil i do not know i i do not know if i well i know there is evil yeah that i would believe in but i do not believe in i do not know i do not want to say it laugh </s>
yeah </s>
if you try to follow it you know it is </s>
mhm </s>
it was just be really scary i think and i do not i do not think uh the good lord put anything there scary f to haunt us </s>
no </s>
you know it is i think people bring that stuff on themselves </s>
mhm which is true </s>
you know it is i do not know i think there is a the the better presence always wins out if you let it so i do not think there is any way i do not think a person can let an evil in unless they really want it in is what i am trying to say </s>
right and i think they say that if you scared of breath of stuff like that then it can breath effect you but if you do not not scared of it and you do not let it bother you then it will not effect you </s>
yeah i think it is i think your beliefs have a lot to do with that too you know if you believe in a higher power and the higher power is going to take care of you </s>
i loved it i actually thought it was a really good movie </s>
yeah oh good </s>

criminal trials ah i'm a little conservative to this day i don't think it should be televised </s>
yeah breath </s>
yeah </s>
breath oh </s>
you can have you can have portraits in there and but and maybe some cameras but when they're actually have to get up it's supposed to be a courtroom </s>
breath yeah i don't know i'm kind of undecided on it i mean on one hand breath i think it's a little absurd to have it televised but you know people if people can go breath themselves and sit in the courtroom and watch </s>
yeah </s>
you know i don't know how different it is breath to have it televised necessarily i mean i i think i i have a problem with it when people are making money off of it breath </s>
well you know what's </s>
you know </s>
what happens is you've got lawyers </s>
but </s>
um the lawyers you have lawyers who are already famous and got a reputation </s>
mhm </s>
so now they reputation has spread they reputation should spread on merit </s>
right yeah </s>
even though even though some of their clients are probably guilty and they may accidently get them off that's the way being a lawyer is in a criminal trial but still </s>
mhm </s>
uh you know like an attorney and a judge shouldn't be allowed to use that as a stepping stone or something else if you do it on your own merits or don't do it at all </s>
right i mean i think it can add if they know it's being televised they might act a way that they wouldn't normally breath cause they want to look good in front of the cameras and breath </s>
yeah </s>
you know if they want to do something after they're a lawyer poli be a politician or something they kind of they need to have that sort of charismatic nature that </s>
yeah </s>
you know if it's important on tv but if you're just trying to defend somebody breath in court without the cameras there you don't really need that so much so it might change how somebody acts breath </s>
yeah )) you really don't want to look like you really don't want to look like a fool when you lose </s>
like </s>
laugh </s>
right yeah laugh </s>
and in front of fifty million people you know </s>
laugh exactly </s>
i'm sure the la uh da does more about that than we do </s>
yeah breath </s>
but um and and you know in our court system today i like to look at courts court tv um but i'm talking something like the old perry mason or ben matlock </s>
mhm </s>
here in philadelphia it the judge ah the lawyers are running the first hour or so the judge goes back and supposedly does paper work cough </s>
yeah laugh </s>
and you know i don't expect it to be like i'm used watching it on tv but i i like to think that the judge is there running his court </s>
right </s>
and you know </s>
yeah </s>
i you know i've been to one jury thing and i didn't see it i saw something different </s>
really </s>
i didn't care for the way the justice you know for what they were doing </s>
hm </s>
in the courtroom in philadelphia </s>
yeah i've never been in one </s>
you know you should try it it takes you the whole day to get out of it </s>
so what really laugh hm </s>
for nine dollars </s>
mhm laugh </s>
i mean like it just doesn't have the feel that you know mean you see some of these lawyers you got the older lawyer he thinks he's running the show </s>
mhm </s>
and you got the younger lawyer trying to make his bones </s>
mhm </s>
you know and the jury is sitting up there simple oh lord you know </s>
yeah </s>
but i usually i usually hope for the best hope that the right person comes out ahead you know </s>
oh sure yeah you just go i don't know i always got to wonder you know who's going to end up being um jury in the situation breath </s>
mhm </s>
you know i in a city like this i mean i think a lot of the people that i'd want to have on a jury if i was in you know that in court probably wouldn't be there you know it's though most people that are probably qualified to be on the jury usually try to get out of it for some reason or another you know they don't have the time or whatever and so you end up with people on the jury that might not be the best people to be making those decisions </s>
yeah that's true </s>
you know that's something that concerns me a little never been in that position where i've had to you know worry about it directly but </s>
yeah unfortunately some people are called two three four times a year and other people are not called </s>
yeah that's right </s>
cough </s>
well one of the things is um they don't you know anyone that's not a registered voter they don't call </s>
true </s>
and it's quite a few people that aren't registered that are probably you know be perfectly capable of being on a jury but for whatever reason they choose not to registered to vote so they just never call those people </s>
mhm </s>
it seems like sort of a flaw in the system right there </s>
yeah </s>
so </s>
uh do you have any do you have any interest in the justice system whatsoever </s>
uh um not particularly i've never really been involved in it in any way how how about you </s>
i take it personal if i'm not doing anything wrong i don't need to talk to nobody in the justice system </s>
yeah </s>
as far as i'm concerned you know what i mean hey i'm just walking down </s>
right </s>
what you calling me for you know laugh </s>
yeah laugh yup that's pretty much the way i look at it laugh </s>
and there's some things that goes one like uh a lot of people do get favored treatment you know </s>
mhm </s>
let's face it you know there's no such thing as equal justice but in can be it could be done a little better sometimes </s>
yeah </s>
you know </s>
yeah i would think so </s>
but )) it doesn't get that way all the time i'm sure i'm sure things go wrong in major cities too so </s>
mhm yeah i don't know i just </s>
well </s>
symbol and breath um dadadadadada you know </s>
you think so breath </s>
yes </s>
i think that the person should not be punished </s>

cause it violates freedom of speech to punish someone for doing that </s>
breath </s>
breath what are you retar </s>
well </s>
what are you retarded laugh breath laugh </s>
breath you are retarded </s>

oh god </s>
i hope we could get that piece of furniture upstairs </s>

laugh </s>
so go ahead tell me what you why do you think a person should be punished mister </s>
because the f flag represents a very symbolic um lipsmack it is uh its its very symbolic and patriotic and </s>
is it more important than freedom of speech breath </s>
breath no its it that what it represents freedom </s>
freedom </s>
freedom that's the basis of our c or or breath how we were like established and breath without that flag that would take away what america means </s>
it would let the people make let the people make up the country </s>
yes no </s>
flags are symbol for the people </s>
but so is the cross for the catholics breath lipsmack the flag is the equivalent to the cross </s>
laugh </s>
to the star of david breath to the the dead sea scrolls </s>
so do you think that the people that burn crosses are uh any different than the people that burn flags </s>
oh they should be that's e that's just as bad </s>
what's bad about burning a cross </s>
the same thing as burning a r a carpet or a flag </s>
they don't burn crosses they light them up </s>
right right </s>
burning a flag is not bad breath </s>
okay </s>
it is not breath </s>
breath </s>

breath so what do you think the punishment should be for burning the flag </s>
death </s>
huh </s>
punishment by death </s>
pun breath people burn the flag they should be burned they should be killed </s>
they should be executed yes </s>
how </s>
in the same manner that they would burn the flag burn them to death </s>
oh so you are saying burned at the stake for burning a flag </s>
yes like joan of ark </s>
well breath that's heavy duty </s>
yes i believe in that breath rich um </s>
breath </s>
i love symbolism and it is uh it is very important it is a disrespect to life </s>
and what do you think the symbol is when you sit around and burn people </s>
death is just is bad </s>
and so one bad so two bad things right </s>
anything that that that deals with destruction is bad and that is it why are you asking me all these questions </s>
laugh breath </s>
breath you know me breath </s>
so um lipsmack you feel they should be burned </s>
do you </s>
oh laugh </s>
w breath breath </s>
so how do you view so you say that you view burning a f </s>
no why don't why do you ask all the questions get some answers </s>
go ahead ask me </s>
i have asked you the the same questions you asked me ask yourself and i will answer them </s>
i don't think i don't think that they should be punished i don't think that it sh that it is really that you know important an issue that it is only a piece of cloth that they are burning breath that they could burn five thousand flags and there won't be destroying any kind of human value it is an opinion </s>
ha yeah cause you know laugh </s>

the fact they got in they think they are going to get that degree </s>
mhm they think they are going to get pushed through right again laugh </s>
and you know yeah i do not know a lot of times they do you know cause you get ah forced by the dean you know to pass a certain amount of people or you know they start asking a lot of questions </s>
mhm </s>
so you know breath it is just kind of weird that way </s>
well that is crazy like i do not see why they should should get on you for people passing i mean i can understand it if no one passes your class because then maybe you are not quite getting the point across that you need to be getting across </s>
oh yeah </s>
you know what i mean laugh but you can only motivate so far </s>
yeah </s>
laugh you know breath </s>
yeah oh yeah well i i you know breath try to you know basically aim a lot of the coursework at you know human physiology and things because most of the people i am teaching are pre-med </s>

and you know breath i even pull a lot of questions from past mcat exams because you know basically those are questions they are supposed to be able to answer after taking an introductory biology class and just you know a lot of the people just do not do it and breath </s>
right </s>
you know it is cause they either do not show up to class do not show up to review sessions or come to your office hours and then breath when laugh you know they get the bad test grade or whatever they wonder you know what you you know why not why you know basically it is not their fault yeah so </s>
right of course not </s>
yeah so breath it puts you in a bad position i mean cause you know going through school you know you did not you were not always on the ball and stuff but then you know where where i went to school we d also no one complained about their grades so much either so laugh a and whined about it you just </s>
mhm </s>
n excepted what you got so of course it was a smaller school and i think you know if you are a whiner laugh it stood out so that could be the problem too laugh </s>
right </s>
so but it is just my own personal opinions laugh i guess breath </s>
well i do not see where i do not see where </s>
uh </s>
and like i mean in of people i do not see where a lot of people not motivated i mean that is something that is almost a given nowadays </s>
no yeah i do not get it breath i just think a lot of it is the attitude that people do not want to be pushed or if it is if it is too hard instead of when someone gets an answer wrong we are encouraged to tell them that that is okay you know make them feel good about it so they are you know happy about getting a wrong answer but </s>
mhm </s>
you know and therefore do not have that motivation to achieve really you know so </s>
yeah </s>
you know there is that you know there is that ten percent of students who just do not care and that other ten who really do and then a lot of people who just you know i do not know the right direction earlier and their education i think could be you know quite alright but so i do not know laugh </s>
i do not know if has anything to do with the actual public school system or if it is just society in general though </s>
yeah well i think a lot of it is we do not actually have teachers who are capable of teaching in high school like they are supposed to </s>
mhm </s>
i know i have worked with some outreach programs in the sciences and you know a lot of times simply the high s the students know as much as the high school teacher even in the tenth grade you know i had a </s>
mhm </s>
breath i jus we will just say laugh i have tried to help out doing things like science fair projects with p with teacher's groups and simply teachers of wanted me to let the students do things that simply well you could not they were not even scientific facts you know </s>
mhm </s>
things that they should have known better which makes you think okay if the students know better than this and she does not you know how does ah you know how are these guys ever going to learn or you know basically if you never break away from the pack so </s>
well how do they how do they get into a position where they can teach without knowing that </s>
well i think that there has been a lack of checks and balances in the system where </s>
oh my gosh </s>
breath you know there is for instance teachers get hired after a year of service they get tenured breath and then </s>
uh-huh </s>
simply can not lose their jobs and there is no testing to make sure they are still competent no requirements for them to take you know eh uh continuing education courses and you know their raises are simply breath based on time and not really simply on breath you know how are there students doing how well are they are they doing </s>
mhm </s>
so there is really no way breath of gauging you know what kind of a job they are doing to give them a raise and things like that so breath i just think it is just a breath </s>
right </s>
sort of relatively old system hard to tell you know </s>
uh-huh </s>
because you know i had you know in high school i had real good teachers but then i had some that were just laugh total bozo's you know </s>
well i had one i had one really bad experience in high school </s>
breath </s>
and yet i had about three or four that were really good but i went to a little school that basically was in the mountains and </s>
yeah yeah </s>
it is good for surfing </s>
breath okay well we can deal with the surfing but ah you want to make sure you live more inland as opposed to where the water is you know what i am saying so that way my house is still intact </s>
 </s>

hm it is quiet there you know you figure it is probably pretty quiet there is not too many tourists </s>
definitely much less </s>
that is what i would figure although tourism could probably bring in some more money and more financial means but they said no fina you know forget about the financial means give me an island i would be very happy </s>
all you need is a computer the internet </s>
yeah that is about it you know but if systems are down how are you going to get on the internet that is the question like if the phone lines are down </s>

yeah </s>
that is why i remember my days at rider i was like get me out of here and i would i had started college ten years afterwards after high school i did not know what the heck i wanted to so more power to you for knowing what you wanted to do with the animation question is have they trained you pretty well </s>
um i give them a c </s>
really what do you wish that they would have done </s>
yeah um laugh </s>
like how could they have made the program a little bit better </s>
that is a good question ah breath laugh i would have to think about that </s>
laugh cause you are giving them a c but you are not giving them an a </s>
yeah breath um i guess </s>
sneeze </s>
more open labs computer labs </s>
yeah yeah huh uh-huh </s>
that is about pretty much it i could think of right now </s>
right right but other than that they have been pretty good </s>
all yeah </s>
i did not know that they had anything to do with their animation but i guess you know if it is an art then that is partially an art and the whole thing that they have like a good career do they have like a good career planning counseling center for you guys there </s>
i think i think they do um we will see come graduation </s>
okay well you should have been looking beforehand </s>
well yeah i i got my a </s>
god i sound like a fricken mother and i am not even a mother yet laugh </s>
breath i have my ah roots trying to get planted in hawaii </s>
oh are you okay </s>
yeah so lipsmack </s>
oh no i i do not play </s>
alright well there are these there are these video games out that are like virtual reality style and that </s>
mhm </s>
they are they just come up on your p you play them on your pc your keyboard </s>
mhm </s>
and you just uh you play people through the internet so you could there are always players on them and you uh run around shooting each other and it is just like the kids who play them at my school are such dorks that it consumes their whole lives </s>
that is terrible </s>
laugh </s>
i i am a little older than that and uh i do not usually have time to play games on the computer breath i am on the internet i am doing research or looking for something in particular and then i go back to my regular life laugh so n to be honest with you i do not play games with computers i do not even actually have a computer in my home i want to buy one but i financially do not want to just get into that right now </s>
yeah </s>
do you have a computer </s>
i can not um yes </s>
how much did you pay for it </s>
um i think it was like thirteen hundred dollars i am not sure it is an i mac </s>
oh really </s>
i i do not know but uh you can get a computer for like twenty-five dollars a month you know </s>
you know well i know i am really frugal in the way that when that twenty-five dollars a month over a forty year period the computer costs you ten times as much as what it should have been </s>
yeah </s>
had you paid for it um and the only reason why is i was looking at my sister just bought a gateway </s>
yeah </s>
which i spend a lot of time at her house and she probably paid three thousand two hundred dollars for her computer </s>
okay </s>
and it is phenomenal it is the nicest she got an extra large monitor and she has got like all the wonderful sound system and everything that y you can get with a computer she got basically the top of the line and her son spends a lot of time playing games but for her and it is we go on there we look for stuff we do you know priceline dot com and stuff like that and then we continue with our household stuff </s>
so uh </s>
and that is it so i i was thinking like if i wanted to get a computer you know paying over three thousand dollars right now can not afford it do not want to do it </s>
yeah you can start to do everything um grocery shop </s>
yeah it is great it is really good to do that but right now do not have a computer that will be one of the things i do i would say by the end of this year i will purchase a new computer but breath i just right now i am not financially fixed to do that </s>
oh really </s>
that is it so </s>
but um yeah i play a video game until it is like i am waiting to i am waiting for when you buy the video game and you like get strapped up you get your arms and legs strapped up with these little nodes or whatever </s>
mhm </s>
that is when i am going to get a video game system again back something when it starts getting fun again forget the joysticks i want the i want the virtual reality </s>
yeah yeah that sounds like fun that would be interesting i played one of those once when i was in uh atlantic city they have something like that in one of the little um arcades down there on the board walk it was awfully expensive but </s>
ah was it what was the graphics what is what did it feel like you were on like a computer or what i never played </s>
it was b basically just your hands it was not like joystick oriented but it was your hands and your the pressure of your feet moving you stood still you did not like walk around </s>
yeah </s>
eh and it it was k running and killing laugh and yeah </s>
running and killing </s>
you know so basically it is a violence thing again and that is really shameful that yes it is true a lot of people do play violent games i think that also contributes to the downfall of society and children as well </s>
what i know if they made a surfing game i would be addicted to it uh d can you think of any games that you would want to play like breath they had a game about i do not know whatever you are into </s>
uh what kind of games i i guess yeah games as far as like i do not know see that would be hard i i do not know </s>
i know if </s>
oh that is okay you know what made me call i i had just gotten a phone call and my grandson answered the phone and when i got to it was saying i guess it was saying press two if you are not ready </s>
oh laugh </s>
and i pressed two so i lost the call i was like okay people must be trying to call tonight let me try to get a call in </s>
right okay now i completely okay the foreign language thing you want to start </s>
mhm uh-huh breath sure </s>
cough </s>
i think that um i do not think it should be a requirement </s>
right </s>
but i think they should certainly encourage it and and try to stress it breath because there are so many languages in the united states </s>
yes there are </s>
um i think that you know like say for instance we have a lot of spanish speaking students </s>
mhm </s>
that are taught um even in elementary school um they are taught english </s>
right </s>
you know because either they do not speak um english well </s>
mhm </s>
or spanish is their primary language so they become bilingual </s>
right </s>
which enco which makes them more eligible you know y if you are bilingual you y your job prospects go up </s>
definitely </s>
so i think that that american students should breath take another la take a second language so that they can be bilingual and whatever because there are so many different languages </s>
right um see i am bilingual myself but it definitely matters your um geographical area </s>
mhm mhm </s>
because if you live close to canada you should learn french like i used to live close to canada so i learned french which makes sense </s>
right uh-huh </s>
but like now i live in pennsylvania i wish i learned spanish because it is mostly laugh spanish here </s>
right that is right see i live in pennsylvania too now </s>

uh-huh uh-huh </s>
i moved around a lot but i spent most of my time in jersey </s>

yep that is just too funny </s>
that is i know yeah but yeah anyway so that the lcd people know we have we want we we encourage bilingual laugh </s>
do you oh laugh i know i know i always meet someone else from omnipoint </s>
laugh </s>
usually that i know and we get side tracked on something else laugh </s>
uh-huh well the lady i talked to yesterday she did not even want to talk about the subject she was like look let us just talk breath </s>
oh really </s>
she is like i been through all these subjects )) uh subjects before so we talked about the weather and breath laugh </s>
yeah anything else we usually talked about the merger before it went through </s>
uh-huh yeah </s>
and everybody like oh i am losing my job laugh </s>
girl i did not even stress the merger cause since i been to pennsylvania i been through so many um job </s>
cough </s>
take-overs or cu- um plants </s>
re this the first one i been through </s>
see when i first came here i was working in um in the um breath industrial park </s>
breath even golf is warranted for th the amount of money </s>
okay breath breath what about striking </s>
well i mean it's the same difference i mean they go on strike or they or or they uh cough in reference to because they want more money </s>
mhm </s>
and i don't think that they should be receiving that amount of money to play basketball </s>
breath okay let me ask you a question </s>
yes </s>
what do you do for a living </s>
what do i do for a living i'm a secretary </s>
yeah okay now let me ask you a question breath you're a secretary what happens if the going rate for secretaries was a million dollars a year </s>
breath do i think that </s>
would you care if would you would you care if people thought you were overpaid </s>
would i care </s>
breath no i mean if if you were a secretary and you got a million dollars a year for being a secretary breath would and would then people were outraged that you made that type of money would it bother you </s>
probably not and it probably doesn't bother the athletes to receive that amount of money to play basketball breath but i just </s>
okay well that's a double um </s>
breath but see it it what the way it affects us is that we have to pay breath ah it takes so much money to purchase a ticket breath nowadays because of the outrageous salaries that the players are receiving breath and the money that the owners breath have to uh request for a ticket to go to go see a basketball game or go see a football game or a hockey game breath or anything of that nature </s>
okay </s>
it like ricochets off and and affects the the regular consumer </s>
breath i for instance if a philadelphia phillies game a two hundred field box seat costs sixteen dollars breath do you know how much actually of that sixteen dollars goes because of the salary for the player </s>
no i do not i'm not really into sports um </s>
a a dollar fifty it's all concessions </s>
that's </s>
the city breath and the owner's price because he wants to make a profit </s>
okay okay </s>
i don't mean to bark up the wrong tree breath uh but i do disagree with you i those guys deserve as anyone else in their job to make as much money as they possibly can because that's if they can get it god bless them breath it's the owners </s>
mhm </s>
and the cities from which they work at they're robbing the public it's not the players the players </s>
it's not the players </s>
the players don't make a fraction of what the owners and what the city and the concession people breath the people who when you go into the vet and you buy a hot dog it's two dollars and seventy five cents a warm flat sodas two dollars and seventy five cents breath it's because the vending machine people breath have to charge that because the owner of the eagles or the phillies is charging them that much rent to be there to sell that product breath </s>
oh my goodness </s>
it's the owners of the companies and the cities breath that are making this it's not the players </s>
mhm mhm </s>
and like i said i just wanted to make it relative to you because i mean you know you're a secretary i'm a sales manager breath </s>
okay </s>
i make x amount of money but if they were going to say okay breath we'll offer you this job at two million dollars a year breath </s>
laugh </s>
i i wouldn't say well jeeze that's too much it's not fair the public might get mad </s>
laugh breath exa </s>
i'd be all over that </s>
i know you would and so would i so would i i just you know i was looking at it from a different point of view but breath like if i was in that situation and it wa they were offering me that amount of money of course i would accept it </s>
sure laugh </s>
breath but what about the eh but what about the players that that are offered breath two million dollars and they hold out breath to get five million dollars a year do you think that that's reasonable </s>
that's because they uh breath i don't think it's reasonable i think it's sick and crazy that a person who gets paid to hit a bel a baseball breath out in the ball park or catch a basketball and throw it in a hoop is it's it's ludicrous breath </s>
yes </s>
but it's a monster that they didn't create it's it's big business breath </s>
yes mhm mhm </s>
the owners of the company get paid a fortune through concessions breath they ge they get paid a fortune through um advertising merchandising having the rights to have your twelve year old son breath wear a phillies jersey with the player's name on the back </s>
right right right </s>
it's it's not it's it's it's absolutely crazy but the on the other side of the fence the player basically breath has an opportunity to have someone represent him and say breath jared last year you batted three fifty you were the best player in the national league east and the going rate for you breath is four million a year and last year your contract expired and you were only getting paid one i would say well jesus get me four </s>
mhm mhm </s>
breath you know that that's that's the going rate breath put it this way </s>
well that's true </s>
the philadelphia eagles are one of the worst teams in the nfl okay </s>
okay yes </s>
now the owner </s>
don't tell my brother that laugh </s>
oh i i'm a big eagles fan breath the own the </s>
yes laugh breath </s>
the owner of the eagles knows that no matter breath what his team plays like they're going to sell out this vet every home game </s>
right </s>
breath they're going to have the f the home they're going to have the away games on television and they're going to make a fortune in merchandising breath they're the third worst team in the nfl breath yet they're the third most profitable business organization in the league </s>
because they have such a such a following is that why </s>
breath it's because it's because breath </s>
and i just signed up yesterday for it </s>
laugh </s>
so </s>
oh yeah that happened to me the same day i signed up i got i got a incoming call </s>
really </s>
and then yeah you have to make five incoming get five incoming and then five outgoing </s>
uh-huh an and um are you do you have a omnipoint phone or a cell phone </s>
yeah i work for omni i'm inside the building right now as a matter of fact </s>
oh really okay laugh </s>
laugh breath yes so i was like well let me get one of my phone calls out of the way </s>
oh really oh that's pretty neat so </s>
yeah yeah </s>
so it wasn't too hard then to find something to talk about </s>
well um no i'm they just like give you a topic basically just breath i guess so that you won't be quiet on the phone </s>
right </s>
because i guess basically you could talk about whatever you want </s>
right </s>
as far as as far as i know </s>
right oh and so what was the last topic that you talked about </s>
oh my god it was so stupid laugh they said do you feel safe in your neighborhood um if you do you know what makes you feel safe if you don't what can you do about it </s>

uh-huh </s>
when i first saw it it was scary to me </s>
oh really </s>
because it's more like scary psychologically rather than you know like ghosts or whatever coming out at you </s>
mhm </s>
it's like you think about it and it's scary after you think about it </s>
w what was it about like </s>
oh it was about um uh he's a child psychologist </s>
mhm </s>
and he um counsels kids with problems or whatever and he happens to come across a case with a child who has it's called the sixth sense where he can breath actually see dead people and like he could see their spirits or whatever </s>
hm </s>
and he doesn't understand why they're haunting him and comes to find out it's because breath like it's sort of his purpose for him to help them but he doesn't realize that </s>
oh </s>
because he's a little boy you know what i mean </s>
uh-huh so like is it people that were killed or something </s>
so </s>
yeah he's like helping them find out </s>

omnipoint no it's omnipoint customers the you don't have to be an employee but breath you have to have an omnipoint phone </s>
uh-huh lipsmack oh </s>
that last person i talked to told me they're doing research into breath um whether or not like you the quality of our voices over the phone is good enough to do commands breath over the phone for instance breath like i guess they figure in the future they're gonna have where you can just call your house and say lights on or turn stove on or cook whatever </s>
really </s>
and and that through your phone your voice has to be strong enough and the signal has to be strong enough so that the phone recognizes so i mean so that uh whatever it is that is going to get the message from your phone breath recognizes </s>

breath right </s>
cough </s>
cough </s>
you got to be nuts lipsmack so breath okay so we need to s we have to stay on the whole five minutes or what do we have to do </s>
i think it is six minutes and th then they come on and tell you that uh your time has is up </s>
you can stop talking laugh </s>
or whatever yes breath they give you a choice to say you can stop talking </s>
mhm oh well yeah with well i guess with your </s>
or then but then </s>
with your job that you would want uh drug testing would not you breath </s>
yeah you know and that is fu that is a funny thing is that </s>
laugh </s>
uh at my job they do not even test for drugs so you could have substance abuse counselors who are using drugs </s>
breath </s>
you know that is kind of a strange thing you would think that they would test here of all places but they do not so </s>
huh </s>
i do not know maybe they do not think it is that important i do not know but </s>
well it seems odd that a drug drug counselor would do drugs </s>
that is true that is true but believe it or not there is a lot of people who are recovering addicts who are in counseling </s>
with all in allstate </s>
as far as a higher standard of living i mean what are they referring to as far as far as tax rate i mean you go to new york </s>
well like yeah like new york or um chicago or california maybe things that are i do not know i guess higher in ah you know everything is a little </s>
but that it is like saying should you make more because you live somewhere where things are more expensive it is not i do not believe in it i do not think s </s>
well i i i think so cause it has to breath it has to equal out like um obviously for for someone in in some like middle state that they you know uh things are cheaper or you know they can grow stuff on their land then i think they have a more advantage than somewhere in c new york where rent is like e eight hundred dollars and minimum wage you know it it is not going to do anything </s>
n no i i understand it makes it makes the economy more diverse </s>
yeah </s>
um i mean it is th the change is so different from up north where i am you go down south it is it is i mean e car prices uh grocery prices everything is completely so much cheaper it makes it more diverse but it it makes it tougher as far as job qualifications if you are i mean if eh breath i mean look at what what is minimum wage i mean it is it is barely living minimum wage </s>
right right but unfortunately there are people that you know </s>
cough </s>
do not have that education and need breath you know that have to have you know minimum wage jobs </s>
correct </s>
but i do not think that is fair </s>
so in other word </s>
if they are living in an area that unfortunately you know cost of living is higher </s>
well i i agree with what you are saying so in other words if they are if if they are forced to a situation or an opportunity where they are not breath granted </s>
breath i think they should just take the situation i think they should take every state into consideration breath and find out </s>
okay </s>
what is it that they are paying and then breath from there decide okay what should minimum wage be but not across the board because you know every place is different breath </s>
well yeah i mean across the board you are talking more about eh i no i go i am beginning to agree more with you </s>
yeah </s>
because across the board sounds a lot more like communism right </s>
breath </s>
i mean breath everybody was worth the same value everybody made the same rate </s>
exactly </s>
um </s>
exactly </s>
and not to mention what you said about the education if if someone is forced into the situation where they do not have the opportunity to go and get that </s>
to get a better job </s>
i mean everybody right </s>
right </s>
everybody is granted i mean everybody has the right to live as you as you said it is bare barely living minimum wage and you are right </s>
right </s>
i agree with you on that </s>
right </s>
ah as far as wha wha what is an extreme we are talking about though </s>
breath um you know like just as i said like in new york just a a situation where breath someone does not have the education or you know they are an elder person where they did not get an education and then they are forced to to live on breath five twenty five where as here in pennsylvania maybe five twenty five would not be so bad because rent is not that bad </s>
right </s>
breath where as over there they have to suffer because it is across the board where i think maybe over there should be a little higher </s>
it ew </s>
breath just to you know c um make up the difference </s>
correct but there has to be a limit or else you know the the value of the dollar goes down i mean if minimum wage becomes something like </s>
right exactly </s>
ten eleven dollars i mean </s>
oh no no no but i mean even </s>
breath a dollar is just not going to be worth a dollar anymore </s>
even at six seven dollars even if it is at at a dollar or two difference uh you know they do pay </s>
right </s>
a hundred or two more than rent than we do </s>
mhm </s>
you know what i mean </s>
correct cough but there it it still leaves circumstances </s>
so </s>
where breath a customer can </s>
laugh </s>
breath where an individ an individual can take advantage of the situation </s>
yeah </s>
where as somebody who does have the economy or anything like that i mean people lie on their taxes everyday why not lie about yearly income or how much they did make you know on a part time job or anything like that </s>
right breath but see the thing is with wi if you do not change the minimum wage then they are forced to take other jobs under the table where they are not you know there are not taxes taken out and breath that also you know what i mean that is where all that cheating and and </s>
i okay </s>
the things come in where as if they had one job that would be sufficient then the the people you know eh what would you rather work two jobs or one </s>
right </s>
you know i am sure people do not want to but they are forced to because their income is not enough </s>
a lot of them you you are exactly right a lot of them are forced to ah a lot of them are forced to sacrifice other things as well </s>
breath right right </s>
for that </s>
so that is where all the cheating of you know not taking taxes and stuff comes in breath </s>
mhm </s>
i know i would not want to work you know if i had wanted yeah breath </s>
i would not want to either laugh one is one is definitely enough for me breath </s>
laugh breath </s>
definitely </s>
are you are you here in um pennsylvania </s>
yes i am </s>
in bethlehem </s>

lipsmack well i made one and i made one yesterday and i had a lady from upstairs too </s>
oh okay oh get out of here </s>
yeah </s>

um breath i do not know yeah it is supposed to be five minutes </s>
what time oh it will tell us breath </s>
yeah it will say </s>
breath </s>
it will say it will stop recording </s>
yeah i would like them to raise minimum wage here particularly breath it seems like they do every new training class though it seems like they do they they increase it </s>
breath well what do they raise it once a year </s>
uh breath </s>
oh once every i don't know how long </s>
they did it twice like last year since i started i have been here since for two years </s>
twice in a year </s>
well i have been here two years i have seen it go up like </s>
really </s>
in in fifty cent intervals every time </s>
oh really </s>
yeah i mean it is </s>
i thought it was raised once every few years or </s>
well they have to because like like we discussed it has to go with the economy it is the same thing </s>
 </s>
not to mention it is also a matter of supply and demand </s>
right </s>
you are not going to get people to work for you if you are paying dirt </s>
yeah i know my father was a steel worker and he had to ah he was in a union but he's that's many years ago and never breath discussed anything with me breath </s>
well i've i've worked around with a a few of the trade unions and uh also railroad workers but i've never been a member of one </s>
uh breath yeah so where are you calling from </s>
uh i'm in downingtown pennsylvania right now </s>
oh okay i'm in allentown </s>
oh that's not that bad </s>
yeah it's not that far </s>
one </s>
yeah </s>
so are i guess we ought to continue talking about unions laugh </s>
yeah e about unions yes okay what do i do i think there's too many unions i think they have breath sometimes they're a good idea sometimes they're not i think that uh the the sometimes the benefits from a union are good you know it's just like if we go on a walk-off and they you know they pay you or go on strike i think that's one of the benefits laugh </s>
i don't know i've i've never had a a good feeling for unions i i've always went and fought for my own raises personally so laugh </s>
uh-huh yeah um i know i have um relatives that work in the steel business and i know that they have they have unions so so i've then again i mean that's a that's a s hard topic to talk about especially when you don't have any association with them </s>
laugh yeah i guess they're just random topics they pick out but um </s>
right i thought maybe we would get the weather laugh laugh </s>
yeah i wasn't sure how it worked you're you're actually my first phone call </s>
yeah you're my first </s>
hey laugh </s>
yeah i was going to make um an outgoing call later on this evening but i haven't </s>
i guess you can make w make one a day or so </s>
right right </s>
for a one outgoing and one in incoming i guess </s>
mhm yeah so what else can we say about labor unions </s>
ah i guess they're okay it doesn't really affect me either way </s>
right right </s>
like i said i've never never worked for one but uh as far as their power </s>
uh-huh </s>
i guess they're fairly powerful </s>
yeah yeah </s>
uh </s>
you c s you know you can hear them doing some breath big things but i don't have um any opinion of them good or bad i guess just what i hear </s>
laugh i g i guess we're pretty much in the same boat as far as that goes uh </s>
yeah so we're going to have to ask for a better better topic next time </s>
i didn't i didn't know we were can you ask for a a specific topic or </s>
i don't know i don't know like this was my first call so i really don't know </s>
yeah i haven't gotten the paper in the mail yeah to tell me exactly uh what's happening with this </s>
yeah i just called yesterday to get on the survey </s>

yeah laugh </s>
well see now we have something to talk about laugh </s>
yeah but we don't have any unions laugh </s>
i know that's true huh do you think we should have one hm </s>
uh it's my personal feeling that we probably should not </s>
i personally don't think we should either i mean i don't know i don't know about down there how many employees do you have i know we have too many employees up here and i think you know if somebody gets a situation where they want to be you know they go to the union and strike i don't know if they're smart enough though these people can hire people off the phone and have them trained in a real short time </s>
yeah i don't i don't foresee a benefit in that </s>
so </s>
i mean uh i know i know we're treated pretty pretty fairly uh </s>
no i'm i'm sorry </s>
i i'm s i'd say i think we're treated fairly um nicely as far as raises and </s>
i yeah definitely mhm yeah </s>
raises and uh benefits </s>
right right </s>
i don't i don't see a </s>
yeah </s>
a great reason to uh have a union in our cir circumstance </s>
right right definitely i mean good working conditions good pay i don't thi yeah i don't see that either so i don't know how long we how long have we been on the phone laugh </s>

good </s>
i don't know there's different opinions when you got interviewed to do this did they tell you that you have to discuss the topic </s>
well i never got interviewed to do it i just uh i i guess i mean i got interviewed over the phone and it said try to stick to the topic </s>
okay so the topic is what as a parent my my children are so little i don't even i can't even think about that do you have kids at all </s>
um i have a ten-year-old daughter </s>
oh okay </s>
eh and uh yeah i haven't even thought about that you know </s>
laugh </s>
i i'll be happy if she just gets to college </s>
laugh get to that point yeah </s>
at this point yeah </s>
let's get there without killing each other laugh um </s>
well i i guess you know it all depends on what what you know like since all our kids are so young i guess it all depends i guess by tenth eleventh twelfth grade hopefully they kind of have a idea where they want to you know what i mean what direction they want to go </s>
right </s>
and and i guess that's how you decide you know what college otherwise if there's no direction then you know i guess pretty much any college you know </s>
right a liberal arts which is </s>
right </s>
you know then then what to do i mean i would definitely recommend that they wouldn't take a course of education like um i don't know uh forestry laugh i know somebody laugh who just got a degree in that i mean </s>
laugh laugh </s>
she's real interested in ecology and so on but she just spent like twenty-five dol thousand dollars on an education but she's breath looking for a job actually </s>
as as a forest ranger </s>
so yeah laugh and how many jobs are available you know doing that laugh </s>
laugh right </s>
i mean it sounds in interesting you know but </s>
huh </s>
uh </s>
and that means you have to live in the forest </s>
yeah she's willing to do that she doesn't want children or anything </s>
right </s>
so i can see that happening but there's pa i don't know it just doesn't seem to wh what are you going to do there's if there's no work in that that's where your education i i guess you could take two majors if you wanted to do something like that </s>
right </s>
and my son he's um artistically inclined but i guess i would recommend that if he wanted to follow to pursue that he would um do that and something else laugh </s>
right </s>
something like </s>
what how old are your kids </s>
um seven my oldest and four my baby two boys </s>
seven and four yeah so we don't have to worry about that for a while </s>

breath did you study any music </s>
breath not really um had like music appreciation type classes </s>

where i don't know if you're familiar with it from the poconos but breath </s>
mhm </s>
we went to the mann music center </s>

mhm </s>
a lot of people get high now and it is illegal so why not just legalize it </s>
because then a lot of kids are going to be doing it </s>
you know like kids are doing it now though </s>
but if they see that is legal they going to think that it is okay to be you know they going to be all doing it and they are going to die they are going to be dying of overdose that i do not think that is cool </s>
yeah i that is true no i agree i agree you are right you are right it is ah it is hard though because a lot of people say that it does not have like a bad effect like cocaine or heroin </s>
mhm </s>
it has a stronger effect you know you are more likely to die from it </s>
mhm uh-huh </s>
something like that so a lot of people say well it is not that dangerous to use marijuana </s>
true i i see where where you are coming from but i look at it i do not think i do not i do not think at all it should be legalized i i do not it is going to be eh someone that is high off drugs uh one it is more dangerous if they are driving </s>
that is true that there is very true </s>
and a lot eh eh and that is very true because a lot of people are going to be driving </s>
yeah you are right </s>
they do breath you know they do it now but if it is legalized now you sometimes you control yourself because breath you you are you are going to be scared that you are going to get caught </s>

if it is to save somebody and it is going to help you know cure something i think it will be okay then </s>
okay </s>
but not you know just to have fun and you know just to have a good time </s>
right right i guess that makes you you have a good argument you are probably right </s>
whoa you see laugh </s>
breath laugh breath no i agree with i agree with you from the beginning yeah i just wanted to hear what breath i like to play devil's advocate sometimes you know </s>
uh-huh laugh what do you think about if they use it for breath you know for curing stuff </s>
i think it is great i mean there are lots of drugs that they use now for breath medicinal purposes that you should not use just to have fun like you know like morphine is like heroin </s>

yeah </s>
well did you go to public school yourself </s>
yes i did so i'm laugh </s>
oh okay laugh </s>
and my so my son he doesn't um i want to try to give him a good foundation i mean eventually he's going to have to because i just can't continue to to afford to pay for a private school but breath uh he currently goes to a private school </s>
mhm lipsmack but yeah if he gets a good foundation and gets good study habits then h you know he'll </s>
right </s>
keep them up once he gets to public schools </s>
right right they have they do i mean even though breath you know they do have some public schools that have um you know that do have the some small programs for pe you know for breath more challenging students so i mean they're not totally bad </s>
well but you know what well i know because i went to public school all my life </s>
mhm mhm mhm </s>
but if you n like like you know wh the schools i went to my mom picked my schools you know </s>
right </s>
she was like h you know even if i had to take a bus to go there </s>
right </s>
you know what i mean she was she didn't come down to the school everyday </s>
right </s>
but she made sure you know i was in a good school she made sure she knew who my teachers was </s>
right right </s>
you know what i mean </s>
yeah </s>
some you know the the parents you got to do that because you know the kids be getting away with all kinds of stuff </s>
that's right it's true </s>
because half the time the parents don't know that's what i think </s>
right </s>
half the time the parents don't know </s>
right right </s>
breath because they're too busy working </s>
i know i know and it's the same because like you said um more pote i mean i know breath men i guess i pay money for my son to go to school breath </s>
mhm </s>
so i want to be involved </s>
right right </s>
right </s>
you have a vested interest you want to make sure he's not wasting your money </s>
that's right exactly laugh that's correct </s>
yeah </s>
so i don't know you know if that's wh you know what causes people to have more of an incentive </s>
lipsmack well i mean if they would realize </s>
um </s>
every day they're working and the taxes that they take out of their check that's paying for the school </s>
exactly exactly exactly </s>
you know </s>
right right </s>
and um my mom was not having none of that </s>
mhm laugh </s>
no you will be going to school so </s>
right right </s>
and um i think i got a pretty good education from public school i i think it's all about what you put into it that's exactly what you'll get out </s>
exactly exactly i did have one disappoint i thought going out of my area to go to school i would get a better education but um you know that i don't think that was true you know yeah so </s>
really well you know what i went out of my area for school </s>
mhm </s>
and i don't think it was so much that the teachers were better but there were more supplies </s>
right right </s>
we all had books </s>
right </s>
there were a lot more extracurricular activities </s>
right </s>
and things like that and like even the lunches and the food was different </s>
right right </s>
because at the school i went to in middle school they was cooking the food there cooking it up </s>
laugh </s>
you know i started going to the school around my around in my neighborhood and you know came in the truck </s>
mhm </s>
off the truck right up on you know on the table eat up </s>
right right </s>
so you know it's different and you know if the parents demand more the school will do more </s>
that's that's true too you do have to play a active role you know </s>
yeah you know what i mean because </s>
you have to let the pta know what you don't like because they ah ultimately represent you and your family and um you know this that's what they're there for and a lot of people don't utilize them the way that they should and then you know there's ways of getting breath you know your point across um an an and heard you know you never know until you try breath um </s>
right eh you know all you can do is do your best </s>
right exactly </s>
and if your kids know you care you know they're going to they're going to do better i think anyway </s>
uh right exactly exactly </s>
yeah </s>
i don't know seems like six minutes but it's not laugh </s>
huh </s>
i said it seems like we've been talking six minutes i'm standing outside so that's why it's like </s>
laugh oh okay </s>
yeah laugh </s>
yeah i'm inside laugh breath well at least it's not cold </s>
because yeah yeah </s>
at least it's not cold </s>
that's so it's just a little rainy where i'm at laugh </s>
oh really it's raining now </s>
yeah laugh yeah </s>
ugh </s>
yeah so </s>
but yeah breath </s>
i don't know but i guess i thought all that could be </s>
lipsmack i don't know i mean i think the voucher program might be okay </s>
yeah </s>
that um katz was talking about sam katz but uh </s>
right yeah </s>
do you know what they're saying about that that's going to suck more money out of the schools that they need </s>
yeah but it also allows people to have more of op more options too you know um </s>
yeah you know it may involve the parent more </s>
right </s>
and um they also said that like with the voucher programs schools would step up they're programs because they want people to keep their kids there </s>
right </s>
so if you want people to keep your kids there you know you going to get your act you know get get your act together </s>
right </s>
start getting books and breath things like that </s>
right exactly exactly so i don't i don't know hopefully laugh breath hopefully it will get improved a lot more and then also the type of kids we have now phase two breath don't uh you know </s>
mhm </s>
make the situation any easier </s>
hold on mhm </s>
so um i don't know i'm not saying all kids but you know just the stuff that's going on ki in the schools now make it really really hard </s>
yeah </s>
but like you said probably if parents are more involved these kind of situations wouldn't happen </s>
yeah </s>
you know these guns and drugs and all this kind of stuff i mean we had drugs and stuff breath when we were going to school but you know laugh </s>
it wasn't no nothing like it is now mhm </s>
no no maybe a you may hear have heard of a stabbing but no one getting shot or anything like that </s>
yeah well you know at my school it was rare to have a fight </s>
the first light is highland the second light is broadhead </s>
uh-huh oh i didn't know that i didn't know omnipoint had employees right down the block </s>
yeah </s>
a few blocks down </s>
yeah </s>
what do you do </s>
yeah activation why don't we discuss this real quick and then we can chat </s>
okay </s>
cause they're recording us laugh um </s>
okay </s>
breath so i yeah i think uh five twenty five is uh terrible lipsmack uh breath i can't see have anybody can actually live off five twenty five </s>
mhm </s>
breath and um uh lipsmack i don't know about the different states though breath cough what do you think </s>
i don't know breath i it's weird because when i think of like just a high school kid getting a job at minimum wage i think five something an hour </s>
breath that's true </s>
is fine but when i think of somebody trying to support a family obviously you know laugh so it's really tough you know </s>
raise a family yeah breath yeah that's true that's a good point breath </s>
i uh no and they always say that when it when it goes up then everyone else pays for it anyway but i don't know i'm not really i don't really have an opinion on that to be honest with you but i do i am pretty opinionated </s>
laugh </s>
but that's one that's one thing that i don't have a real strong opinion either way on really </s>
breath but that's a really good point about the kids starting in school and stuff that's a really good point breath </s>
right </s>
i mean that's a shame that somebody who isn't in school can't start at wawa at eight dollars instead of five twenty five though you know </s>
right </s>
lipsmack or somebody who needs a job can't start at mcdonald's at more than five twenty five </s>
right breath and i think that's where that state thing goes in to play too i mean of course in some states they're making a lot more breath they have a a higher standard of living and they make more money </s>
breath yeah but it's it's it's relative though </s>
and they need more </s>
it's still it's still more or less five twenty five you know what i mean breath it's still getting a uh a little tiny bit of money </s>
mhm </s>
even if it's eight dollars an eight dollars an hour if the standard of living is higher </s>
lipsmack right </s>
it's still crap </s>
mhm </s>
laugh breath </s>
i agree laugh breath i couldn't imagine anyone you know a real person </s>

yeah the world is not it was good it was good </s>
good breath </s>
let us see pierce brosnan um like i said i am i am a sean connery and uh like i said </s>
ah </s>
he is an original bond like as far as </s>
ah i see where you are coming from </s>
breath i am concerned like no one ever does it as breath as well uh roger moore like when he played bond when he took over breath you know like he grew on me though and it was like okay well breath </s>
laugh </s>
pierce brosnan ah they got to add a lot more special effects like they are doing to like boost him up so breath but um </s>
that is true breath laugh i saw that last night actually </s>
oh really </s>
so when it came out yeah so that is great that you saw that </s>
okay yeah you seen yeah breath </s>
yeah </s>
you know but it was ah i like the twists like um the king's daughter oh what is her name king's yeah her daughter </s>
mhm </s>
oh wow that she was behind the whole thing though </s>
yeah it is it is interesting twist </s>
that was like kind of surprising yeah that was kind of surprising </s>
so you do not think he is as good as a actor as sean connery </s>
lipsmack oh no by no means not not in that role not in that role </s>
do you have a not in that role </s>
see now that he is an actor okay he came from remington steele okay so </s>
right </s>
with that in mind you know ah well see it was like a different league trying to play bond and try to fill sean connery's shoes </s>
that is true </s>
okay roger moore could roger moore had a tough time doing it you know so you look at that </s>
yeah breath </s>
you know i mean he did good but sean connery is like classic bond you know breath </s>
laugh that is funny yeah that is true i like um breath </s>
yeah </s>
i like some of the older bond too with sean connery so breath </s>
yeah </s>
they are more of a classic style </s>
yeah right </s>
sean connery has that um that kind of spy </s>
right breath </s>
spy look about him he is very suave when laugh when he plays the role </s>
but the thing that is so ironic about it sean connery is not even he is not even british he is scottish </s>
laugh breath it is funny yeah i agree with you </s>
laugh you know yeah so </s>
well that is cool that you saw the movie then </s>
you know </s>
i thought it was much better than the third one </s>
yeah </s>
breath i thought overall um you know as an actor he did um his lines were not as cheesy as the last one i thought some of his lines that he had in the one before was terrible so laugh </s>
right yeah breath i mean like it </s>
it was better breath </s>
i like the plot i mean the plot is always good but you can always figure somebody is trying to take over this take over that breath but it was like sort of a twist with alex the um the daughter actually </s>
yeah </s>

breath </s>
well i think the independently wealthy would take care of all the other things breath </s>
well let me ask you a question now that i have a few minutes w exactly what do you consider independently wealthy </s>
right breath i don't know um i would say i would probably say like five million </s>
you okay </s>
to qualify me as independently wealthy </s>
um well ideally i would say at least ten </s>
ten why do you say ten </s>
yeah you got to cause you got to be able to live off the interest right </s>
sure right yeah </s>
so you figure if you are making like i do not know six percent interest or something </s>
right </s>
you are making about six hundred grand if i do not know taxes </s>
yeah </s>
you figure they are taking off like thirty percent thirty five percent </s>
right mhm </s>
you are left without about four hundred grand and if you want to be able to go on some serious vacations and just do not even care about buying whatever you want </s>
right yeah </s>
you are going to need that kind of money </s>
yeah that is true yeah so that i guess ten you are right ten million would probably be the number </s>
yeah so in case you know you ever have to consider it </s>
laugh breath right ten million is the number then right </s>

yeah yeah the seventy six is closed because some truck went into the over pass or something </s>
breath really </s>
uh last night and they they were afraid that they the the guy like cause it was too high the truck </s>
right </s>
and and uh they were afraid they screwed up the structure of the uh the whole bridge so they have to </s>
breath that south street bridge </s>
yeah i think that they are a afraid yeah the south street bridge i think they are afraid peop people would actually drive either over it or under it or something </s>

uh-huh </s>
it is uh it is there is a lot of traffic right now </s>
yeah do you like going to franklin mills do you go there a lot or </s>
um no i i really i got a couple of friends in from out of town so i am just heading taking them there but it is it is a little too far you know </s>
okay yeah </s>
eh it </s>
i ah i find it overwhelming </s>
oh </s>
just the size of the mall you know like it is just </s>
yeah like we have four hours now and i do not know if we are going to be able to do it </s>
yeah right like it is like this all day thing and you know </s>
you know </s>
it it is just like all the sale sign you know i just feel like i am in like uh breath a grind you know a mill or some you know i mean guess it is a mill but breath </s>
but meanwhile king of prussia is not exactly uh you know a two minute </s>
yeah that is </s>
i i do not know i find king of prussia is worse because here at least it is it is uh it is kind of straight </s>
right yeah that is true </s>
w w whereas king of prussia you walk around and i i kind of almost get lost somewhere between the two floors and the two malls and i do not know i prefer to be to go to this one </s>
yeah breath right mhm </s>
yeah </s>
breath </s>
but i i do not know you can get some pretty damned good deals at franklin mills if you go to the right places </s>
yeah if you if you buy like out of ah out of season and stuff breath </s>
yeah like we are going to down to the sachs outlet or whatever </s>
uh-huh </s>
and stuff that should be like eighty dollars could potentially be like twenty dollars </s>
yeah right i know </s>
stuff like that you know </s>
well i did after going to franklin mills too like when you go to uh back up to king of prussia you are like only suckers pay full price you know cause breath laugh </s>
laugh breath well that is that is it that is the problem with king of prussia right </s>
yeah </s>
laugh </s>
right everything is just like you know marked up to the max </s>
have you been to foreman mills </s>
no </s>
what is that y you know what that is like and what kind of stuff they sell there </s>
i have no idea no </s>
no i </s>
no </s>
i just i hear their commercials all the time on the radio but </s>
breath yeah i never yeah no i have never been there </s>
i think there i think there is one in west philly but like way down on market i think down on like at in the fifties or sixties </s>
oh okay it would have to like i guess it would if it w i guess it would be the sixties cause there is like a lot of uh like there is a lot of like strip mally kind of stuff </s>
oh really </s>
down there yeah </s>
do you live in the forties or are you uh further down </s>
i live in the yeah i live in the forties yeah </s>
oh okay that is not so bad i was wondering cause like i figure you would be in the fifties or sixties that uh </s>
no the fifties are kind of hairy like you know i do not there is not really too much going on there that that you would you know i do not know </s>
yeah you are not are you like at all concerned when you go out at like at night or whatever you walk around or </s>
um you know i probably would be but i have uh i have a german shepherd so uh like i very rarely walk anywhere without the dog </s>
laugh okay </s>
so you know and when i do i do feel a little vulnerable you know what that that is that is true </s>
yeah that is actually uh a pretty smart move i do not hear that often around here but the the german shepherd should do it </s>
yeah that is what i think that you know it should first it should you know go to court and not be known not not not having no one there going to court for this or that i guess it could also hurt their career or whatever their business just know that the um you know a criminal case breath and what do you think </s>
breath i agree with you that i think if um they are put before the public light that that that is going to harm their breath um it is just going to make them look bad or like they did something wrong before they had the chance to be um i do not know the words laugh </s>
breath laugh take your time you do not </s>
breath yeah </s>
yeah because then what it does is yeah if you found in court as a crime and they come back out in the public the world will remember that what happened in life and remember they got arrested for whatever may be </s>
yeah there is they are going to think that they did something wrong or they are going to have their own opinion right </s>
right so you know that is why it is best that you know anyone to be the the uh kept you know quiet until it comes to light the trial a decision made then you can you know see it publicized but until then it should not even be said it is not fair to the person that just might not have done it and and become falsely accused </s>
right </s>
it would damage their career </s>
yeah </s>
cough </s>
gives them a bad image laugh </s>
your bad image that caused that is slander of character that that causes them and may cost them their business it seems like no more there is a person that works in a child center breath in a day care center and they get accused of uh </s>
of doing right </s>
molestation but they di but they go to court and they see the paper and they get acquitted when people are innocent image in people's mind is this person is a ch ch child molester or child abuser whether they get acquitted or not that is the first image that comes to their mind because they got arrested if they did not do it then why would they get arrested that is the thing if you did not do it then why did you get arrested people get arrested all the time for things they did not do </s>
that is right </s>
it is just not publicized i am saying that i think it would do but there are people or we are locked up and harassed for nothing </s>
that is right laugh help you out here laugh </s>
come on let me out here laugh breath breath six days is a long time </s>
breath you are a good thinker yeah you are a fast thinker </s>
who me you think so oh i try to think fast </s>
i usually have to take a a while before i form my opinion and breath </s>
um breath well you know </s>
i have to think everything over </s>
i just you know based on the last subject so far as high profile breath and um </s>
mhm </s>
going to court breath the media makes news off of high profile people so and the they they form their opinion in the papers so they always judge before they go to trial </s>
right right </s>
that is why they should be cutting out the paper breath that that is when it comes to money and things not a justice thing anymore it becomes a money issue </s>
yeah </s>
because the papers want to make money the lawyers want to make money and then the person going to court is definitely going to lose money </s>
that that is true </s>
because you know shared past legal fees and anything else even if he did not do it breath so but freedom of speech breath mhm do need to know what is going on high profile figures breath breath you have anything to feed into that laugh </s>
laugh laugh i am speechless laugh </s>
breath you are speechless you should not be speechless </s>
laugh yeah laugh breath laugh no i do i agree with what you are saying breath i do not think they should have them televised </s>
breath yeah because for example eh you could look at cases that uh breath too bad we got acquitted cases um one of the kennedy's sons breath and they was accusing him of rape and he was acquitted of it but it hurt his image </s>
uh-huh right </s>
breath for a minute but he was a kennedy so he was alright but just the fact that they publicized his case in the papers and everything then you have the oj trial laugh </s>
mhm cough that is what i was thinking of but i did not say it </s>
breath right who get trials </s>
i am thinking i do not believe him for a darn laugh i do not think anybody does and i i agree that if they would not have published if they would not have put it all on tv everybody would probably be like well i do not know what happened you know but since they did that it is like yeah na i do not think that anybody believes him </s>
right exactly only it looks like most people that he is guilty breath </s>
well some people do that is that is not true i know people that do believe him but i myself do not </s>
yeah i guess it should be elective </s>
yeah it should be elective it shouldn't be mandatory because breath some people don't pick up the english language or you know any kind of other language very well it should just be an elective it shouldn't be mandatory </s>
yeah just like in in high school i guess but i i can't see colleges making you do it </s>
yeah no because if you're going for like a starting degree what why what what would help you to know s french </s>
r right unless i get </s>
it wouldn't help you at all </s>
yeah but i guess like certain degrees you have to learn like latin you might have to learn for some for some degrees </s>
yeah and i would it would </s>
and breath that would be mandatory </s>
it would be too hard you know if you already had to do one breath you know just for your degree that you had to do one that was mandatory </s>
right right </s>
how they would do it </s>
yeah can you imagine learning latin and uh like french at the same time or something like that </s>
i would i wouldn't do it </s>
no </s>
i couldn you know i wouldn't do it </s>
i don't think i would be able to do it laugh breath </s>
yeah </s>
are you doing this study long </s>
what </s>
have you been uh participating in the study for a long time </s>
no i just got one </s>
no </s>
are you talking about this phone call or </s>
yeah the phone call study </s>
no i just got one call </s>
really </s>
yeah </s>
i haven't gotten my rules and regulations yet but i i don't know sounds like a good thing but anyway yeah to do to d make a college say it's mandatory for breath foreign languages i think would be ridiculous </s>
it's very ridiculous that's just another thing the government doesn't need to control us on </s>
no no no not at all but uh breath the study's uh i mean you're involved </s>
 </s>
when you graduate high school and you go on to college </s>
that's your own thing </s>
you're looking for a specialty right you're looking for a degree in something </s>
yeah uh-huh </s>
and for them to say that you have to take a language would be um a difficult thing for a lot of people to get through </s>
ludicrous </s>
yeah because it's it's hard enough i mean there are courses and how would they even work that into their curriculum </s>
yeah ah </s>
you know i i mean if you're taking like if you're going to be a business major i guess maybe in it would have some advantages like if you were a business major to learn breath a different language </s>
i mean it would make you more you know adequate in this world you know it would help you out but it would be a lot stressful you know </s>
yeah yeah i mean i think everybody it would be good if everyone knew spanish because that seems to be like it's starting to get like the second cultural language breath to learn </s>
tell me about it it'll be like california soon </s>
i know </s>
everything's in spanish </s>
i know well i know even at work if you know spanish you you have you can make more money </s>
uh-huh </s>
because you're bilingual but for the colleges to turn around at that point in your life and force you to learn another language that would be uh that would be a big burden i think on a lot of people </s>
yeah uh-huh </s>
but um who knows i mean it might be something that college students are going to face down the road you know just one more thing that they're gonna have to add on to their curriculum </s>
yeah </s>
uh glad i'm beyond that now then laugh </s>
yeah </s>
cough but i mean if you were going for a major in like marketing or uh like computers it doesn't make sense </s>
yeah </s>
to to do that you know business study it might breath medical profession </s>
mhm maybe </s>
i don't think would be too good for them to </s>
no they say you should have to learn latin but you don't really need latin </s>
yeah they they don't need it anymore </s>
in medical no they don't even </s>
oh well </s>
because they don't use it because it's there's so many different you know terminologies for things they don't even use it </s>
right right </s>
you know </s>
yeah they probably will just distract </s>
so </s>
from the course of study anyway that you're involved in </s>
yeah </s>
it's probably not going to be a beneficial thing </s>
uh-huh </s>
if you wanted to i mean they should always leave it as as an option for you to take but </s>
yeah </s>
i don't see how they could work it into the course of study </s>
uh-huh </s>
but anyway it breath that that to me is a real breath i don't know that that that should be a personal preference </s>
yeah </s>
rather than something that's mandatory it's like you know forcing you to do like even like community service when they do some high schools do that </s>
uh-huh </s>
where they force students to do community service if it's an elective in high school it should be an elective in college too i think the uh secondary languages </s>
yeah </s>
most people know some form of a different language anyway </s>
mhm </s>
by the time that you're you're getting out into the real world and and you're working just by uh everyday use </s>
yeah </s>
you usually have some kind of a language skill even if it's just a little bit it's enough to get you through i mean everybody knows how to say hello in spanish right </s>
yeah </s>
i mean it's just uh i i don't see colleges doing i i don't know if they were were uh if i missed that they were talking about </s>
would it be just a year </s>
doing </s>
or would it be four years or just a semester </s>
breath yeah or would it be like uh i maybe if they if they did like a semester of the basics for us like a few different languages </s>
but that's not enough time though to uh </s>
breath </s>
to grasp the the whole i uh usually i can say the words but i have like um been working i have like my mind has gone blank </s>
uh-huh </s>
i i don't think i would um i do believe in spirits but i i guess i wouldn't call them ghosts but breath you know i i call them spirits and um </s>
mhm </s>
yeah i do believe in them but i don't i don't think i would uh stay in a house um that was haunted that i knew that had you know spirits running through there um there's a movie out called um on haunted hill or something like that the house on </s>

right </s>
it was really good i can't remember what it or who they featured but it was excellent no we were we were sitting outside </s>
do you you like classical music </s>

laugh breath well you're stuck in the eighties just like me </s>
i know they're like too high tech laugh breath </s>
you know i i understand </s>
laugh no i just like the idea of the tape i don't know why it's like more tangible a thing and it's like a little disc that looks so fragile laugh </s>
laugh </s>
and um my my problem is my tapes are old and all my classical music tapes are really shot um lipsmack and i had to move my stereo away from the child's fingers </s>
laugh </s>
cause she was playing laugh with it all the time breath so it's like breath i'm i'm i'm actually scared to listen to anything if she's around cause i don't wanna awaken her </s>

yeah well i played violin </s>
wow </s>
and i played breath the xylophone for a little bit </s>

lipsmack where are you from </s>
i'm nigerian </s>
oh okay you would learn spanish </s>
yep i would learn spanish if i was gonna live here in fact even though i'm here i would even like to learn spanish for the fact that i'm here and spanish is a very prevalent language in this society now in africa french is more of the is a better secondary language to learn than spanish </s>
oh really </s>
there's ver yeah there's very little spanish in africa but there's a lot of french breath it's like seventy english thirty french or breath almost like the ratio you have here </s>

okay </s>
from my understanding and talking to different ones that have called a lot of people work for omnipoint and they breath they work with them too </s>
how many calls can you make in a day is there a limit </s>
it's only one call per day and you can either make a call or receive a call and all i've been doing is receiving the call </s>
okay </s>
i haven't made any calls </s>

they kind of catch me with receiving the laugh laugh and they always kind of catch me at all the odd times cough </s>
yeah exactly that's what keeps happening to me </s>
cough yes yes they always catch me at all the odd kind of times when i'm doing something fixing dinner and i have to stop for five minutes to to do this </s>
right </s>
but it's okay </s>
yeah it's good </s>
you meet different people over i mean you meet different people breath from different various backgrounds in doing this </s>

that's why i thought it would be interesting also i used to um do market research </s>
mhm okay </s>
and um lipsmack you it was it was a fun job i'm a telephone person so it's kind of fun </s>
interesting </s>
i thought it would be fun to do </s>

lipsmack yeah i mean to get paid for just five minutes of your time and for to do what i think it's ten calls you you have to to uh have </s>
right </s>
before it's done before you're through breath so breath i don't think it's bad for the money </s>
no it's not </s>
lipsmack you know because all you're do you're sitting down doing no laugh nothing </s>

okay breath </s>
because it did protect us a lot </s>
okay </s>
um and uh we had to pay a real small fee out of our check to the union um but uh i think the union was definitely beneficial </s>
mhm </s>
uh rather than being in a situation like that and not having that kind of protection </s>
right </s>
uh at least that's what i think uh as far as that goes </s>
what i've heard about unions is very positive they do help the uh smaller people </s>
mhm </s>
rather than have big companies just uh you know </s>
yeah </s>
project on them what they want </s>
yeah exactly </s>
and then the little person doesn't have a voice in that way breath </s>
yeah yeah i mean i think uh i if if you're in a situation like that uh in a non-corporate job let's say </s>
right </s>
uh and a lot of people are more of like uh a blue collar type of position </s>
exactly </s>
um the unions can definitely help there </s>
mhm </s>
uh and even a few friend of m friends of mine who work for you know other companies like even lucent technologies and whatnot breath um are are now in the union </s>
mhm </s>
um and if they you know get terminated unfairly or something like that </s>
yes yes </s>
the union's there to protect them and they can help them get their job back </s>
right </s>
and fight for them a little bit </s>
right </s>
so i i </s>
yes i have f </s>
yeah </s>
go ahead </s>
yeah i think it's really beneficial it if you can be i mean right now i'm not myself but uh </s>
right i had a friend a friend whose brother was uh working for ford </s>
you know it's mhm </s>
and they terminated him for theft </s>
oh really </s>
and he said he wasn't guilty he was off for about a year </s>
mhm mhm </s>
and the union managed to get him back on with back pay </s>
mhm oh yeah </s>
including vacations and all the benefits that he would have had if he were working there so yes i think i could say i would really breath go for a union laugh </s>
yeah oh yeah definitely </s>
right </s>
yeah </s>
never had opportunity to be a part of one but </s>
yeah </s>
if i did i think i would </s>
yeah where are you from bernice what region </s>

yep my brother lives down in havertown </s>
oh really okay </s>
uh area so i know exactly where that is </s>
yeah have you ever had occasion </s>
yeah </s>
to use the union when you were in that position </s>
uh yeah i mean uh i well i never really had to use the the facilities that they gave me or use the you know they what they stood for </s>
mhm </s>
um because it never really came to that it was more or less a temporary summer type position </s>
mhm oh okay uh-huh </s>
that i had but um breath uh but union people did come around and they did you know make sure everything was going smoothly and and kind of breath gave a little bit more power to the people so to speak </s>
right </s>
i guess you can say </s>
exactly </s>
um but i never really had a major problem that i had to get the union involved </s>
okay </s>
uh with that so to speak but it's good just to know they're there i guess </s>
exactly </s>
especially in a job like that </s>
it makes you feel better laugh </s>
yeah yeah </s>
right okay well that's good </s>
yeah what uh i forget the what the first topic was also uh union and pub uh it was uh i couldn't hear very well it was like public um </s>
hm </s>
i did you hear did you catch that </s>
i would have thought there was just one topic </s>
the beginning </s>
i'm i'm probably confused here laugh </s>
yeah yeah the the the female voice said um it was a a top our our our opinions of the labor unions and and also uh breath it was something else uh in the workplace i i'm not sure what it was i couldn't hear very well </s>
oh i'm sorry i thought it was how they're ever gonna in the work place uh i was walking down the steps when the phone rang and so </s>
yeah oh okay yeah </s>
i probably didn't get the first part of her conversation </s>
yeah yeah it's not a big deal breath but uh </s>
okay </s>
yeah i mean uh unions are definitely the way to go i i would say uh if you can if if you can be a part of that </s>
right </s>
um </s>
i would agree </s>
well but uh yeah sounds good </s>
well this is my first call so i don't know do they tell you when it's over or do they leave it up to us </s>
yeah i'm not sure uh this is the first time i've called too i just uh got it through my workplace uh and i signed up for it </s>
okay </s>
so i'm not sure if the uh </s>
actu </s>
if eh breath if you have to usually y they say you can call in or they then you can just put yourself or your open times to receive the call </s>
right </s>
um so i just uh this is my first try too </s>
okay </s>
uh at the topic </s>
i think i think they're goinna come back on i'm trying to watch my watch to see i think they're gonna come back on when it's over </s>
y yeah </s>
um uh </s>
yeah </s>
not really sure laugh </s>
what kind of uh service do you have uh bernice </s>
omnipoint </s>
oh you have omnipoint </s>
yes do you </s>
it sounds good yeah i have omnipoint too i actually work for omnipoint laugh </s>
oh you're kidding so do i </s>
yeah you do </s>
yes </s>
where at in philly </s>
laugh in ben salem </s>
oh at ben salem </s>
yeah where are you l out of </s>
i'm in the call center lehigh valley bethlehem </s>
you i was up there we go up there for training </s>
well breath i mean to me there are actually two separate issues you know one is the education part and one is the actual entertainment part </s>
eh okay so you're you're </s>
i mean that is the way i see it </s>
splitting up recreation and you're and you're separating it from education </s>
breath yeah cause to me you know it does doesn't make background like uh i uh it's one thing to educate uh prisoners it's another thing to provide them with the television and with uh breath you know </s>
c come on you're exactly right i mean breath uh you you're alw you're always allowed to breath broaden your horizons but breath you're being punished you shouldn't be able to watch johnny carson while you're behind bars i agree with you breath </s>
laugh breath may- maybe they should be restricted to like either </s>
breath um uh </s>
educational programming or x number hours of educational </s>
there's a fine li right you're you're exactly right there's a fine line to walk though breath how much you know where where's that line drawn between breath restriction and cruel and unjust punishment you know i mean breath </s>
yeah </s>
s solitary confinement is a little bit too extreme in some cases too depending on you know if somebody's in there for evading tax evasion or something like that i mean breath they're not a murderer they don't have to be in like solitary confinement if they're if they're just a loud mouth breath </s>
yeah </s>
breath but educ education might be a benefit to them anybody whose in there for the wrong reason or anybody whose in there for doing something stupid perhaps education was something that they were neglected of during during their normal lifetime outside of prison breath </s>
yeah </s>
perhaps this is uh somewhat of a re rehabilitation for them i don't know breath cough </s>
i kind of i uh i think i've seen documentaries on this before </s>
oh god yeah cough mini series all kinds of junk soap operas you know </s>
a and and i recall like seeing one prisoner saying that uh </s>
cough </s>
you know basically they go in for like two years you know let's say that the guy has i don't know stolen something </s>
cough cough </s>
you know or like broken into a house breath get's like a year or two </s>
mhm </s>
sits there like on the weights all day cough they literally like gain breath thirty forty fifty pounds of muscle </s>
right right right i know it comes </s>
come back out and a lot of them are actually more effective criminals </s>
right well exactly uh more more of a uh uh </s>
you know </s>
a walking danger to to john q public i know </s>
breath lipsmack and then like the breath you know </s>
breath i know a lot of people a lot of people y that you'll see like that will come out with a reformed religion too breath breath uh for some reason because breath </s>
lipsmack yeah </s>
when they when they know that all they have once they they screw up in their life is is iron and ore and bars to deal with and and the other idiots behind bars </s>
breath </s>
i agree with you and and i'm kind of giving another aspect to think about at the same time you know what i mean breath </s>
yeah </s>
uh i i know what you're saying ah well let's go back to the tv part too now if they're behind tv now remember when you were younger and your parents blamed you for d doing something stupid what did they always blame it on tv y y you kids watch too much tv you know i mean what are we going to do </s>
laugh breath </s>
i i for one tried to listen to my parents when i was younger i don't laugh know but breath maybe there is a lot of violence on tv and everything like that maybe there should be a restriction like you were saying before breath the weightlifting thing though that's i don't even know if that's oh i guess we can consider that recreation definitely </s>
yeah that's why you know it's breath a creation of so many parts one is like saying should they sit around all day playing poker </s>
right </s>
one is saying like should they sit around all day watching tv the other is like should they sit around breath all day playing basketball or lifting weights </s>
right and although i i've i've heard that making license plates is quite a workout too </s>
lipsmack and </s>
no i'm just i'm kidding laugh i don't know breath but um i don't know </s>
laugh breath cough yeah i mean i i don't know i think it's it's a weird it's a very weird topic it gets too breath i think it's too broad because breath a lot of people are probably you know upset with the fact that maybe their their money is going towards someone else's television breath </s>
that's that's what the whole aspect is that's what the one part we really haven't talked yet i why should i pay for some idiot who screwed up in his life </s>
breath and let's face it i mean you know a lot of people e especially in philly for instance </s>
breath oh uh-huh </s>
th they can't afford to buy like a nice television breath you know and </s>
why should people that that screw up and do things that are illegal get them laugh </s>
yeah i mean which is i think part of the incentive for a lot of these people to end up in jail </s>
no breath well let's think about it though if we're paying for it breath i mean it bull shit and tv's are probably among the cheapest things that we have to pay for for prisoners i mean we're paying for it already breath y think about the construction of the building number one taxes to keep it maintained well taxes to pay for their electricity their their heat their water the the manpower that works there it's it's already talking about you know millions and millions of dollars breath why tack on another another uh </s>
yeah breath </s>
you know a couple hundred grand for a library so they maybe they can burn the books laugh you know </s>
yeah breath i suppose breath the p problem with the educational part in my opinion </s>
mhm </s>
is that education is breath the type of thing that's going to be cough it's going to have to be voluntary you can't force it upon someone so breath you know </s>
right </s>
where as you know if you have an hour what are you going to do are you going to read a book or are you going to play basketball i'm sure eight of the ten or nine of the ten people in jail are likely going to wanna play basketball </s>
basketball then then read a book no i i agree with you i know exactly </s>
breath yeah so how m- you know how much are they gonna learn if it's not really voluntary </s>
well that's true um breath the breath what what's the answer though i mean have you ever seen clockwork orange </s>
breath i have or obviously i've heard about it but i haven't actually seen it breath </s>
okay i mean that's i mean we could always go back to the brain washing method i don't know laugh if that was such an effective thing you know </s>
laugh </s>
yeah this is mine how about you </s>
oh no no i've made like well i've gotten like two calls already and i've i've made like four or five or something </s>
oh okay so yeah i i tried calling a few times but i wasn't able to get through breath but </s>
yeah i tried to call actually a little while ago and nobody was available </s>
oh okay </s>
um breath i don't know so what do you think laugh </s>
laugh breath sure breath whatever breath </s>
i i i i have to think i don't know me personally i don't think that like that i don't know that's a tough one i don't i don't think </s>
yeah </s>
that our tax dollars should pay for it but i think that </s>
but it seem i i think it should be there but we shouldn't have to pay for it laugh </s>
yeah i know i know laugh that's what i was going to say i was going to say i think that it should be available to them laugh some way like because i mean i don't know because you know for people who aren't going to be there for life or on death row or something </s>
uh-huh </s>
maybe it could you know it could be serve as something productive or something for them </s>
yeah that's true </s>
but uh i don't know </s>
don't know </s>
but um so how did you learn about this study </s>
