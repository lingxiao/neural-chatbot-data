- Yeah.
It' s June.
- Yeah.
Look at his partner.
They just came in.
- What' s going on?
I' il check out this asshole at the bar.
Billy will make sure I behave.
Will somebody tell me what' s going on?
No bullshit this time.
Just sit tight, Billy.
Philip!
Man, what' s happening, Phil?
- I told you!
Everybody freeze!
Turn around.
- Keep your hands on the table!
What' s wrong?
- What' s all this gun, man?
You changed.
Get back or I' il blow your brains out.
Police.
Move and I' il kill you.
Don' t move!
Turn over!
Way to go, Rosewood.
You know that?
Sorry for the disturbance, folks.
Everything' s under control.
Taggart.
Would you explain why you and Rosewood were in a strip bar out of our jurisdiction while you were on duty?
Before you chastise these officers, there' s something you should know.
The only reason they were at a strip bar is because they were tailing me.
They were outside wondering what I was doing.
I was in having a good time.
I' m into those things.
These guys waited outside and the only reason they came in was because they saw two men with bulges in their jackets going in.
Well, these guys were going to commit a robbery.
They watched them, waited for them to make their move, then foiled a crime.
I did not know what was going on.
I' m freaked out.
They must have a sixth sense.
I don' t know what you teach them, but they' re not just regular cops.
They' re supercops.
The only thing missing on these guys are capes.
ls this what really happened?
No, sir.
Would someone tell me what happened?
Well...
Foley invited us to this bar.
- Right.
And while we were there,
Foley observed the two suspects casing the establishment.
And before we knew what was going on, he' d already disarmed one of them.
Detective Foley deserves all the credit for the arrests, sir.
I would prefer you did it in Detroit.
I' m sorry.
But before I go I want you two to know, the supercops story was working.
OK?
It was working and you guys just messed it up.
But it' s cool.
Just fuck up a perfectly good lie and it' s all right.
You guys are off the case.
Foster, McCabe, your turn.
- Not a chance, sir.
ln my office.
Morning, gentlemen.
- Coffee and doughnuts.
There he is.
Morning, officers.
You the second team?
We' re the first team.
We won' t fall for a banana in the tailpipe.
You won' t fall for the banana in the tailpipe?
It should be more natural, brother, like this.
"I ain' t falling for no banana in my tailpipe." It' s more natural for us.
You' ve been hanging out with this dude too long.
I' m sorry, I' m just fucking with you.
- No problem.
I' ve seen enough.
You want something to drink?
I got some stuff in the trunk.
Excuse me.
For a man on vacation, you look like you' re on a stakeout.
Stakeout?
I' m picnicking.
This is a picnic area.
I' ve been shooting the shit long enough.
Time for me to take in some sights.
Excuse me.
What the hell' s he doing?
Can you put this in a good spot?
This shit happened last time I parked here.
May I help you?
I' m looking for Victor Maitland.
You realise that this is a members only club?
I have to talk to Victor.
- Yes.
Very dark skin.
Capricorn.
Why don' t you give me the message and I' il take it to him?
OK.
Tell Victor that Ramon, the fella he met about a week ago...
Tell him that Ramon went to the clinic, and I found out that I have... herpes simplex 10.
I think Victor should check himself out with his physician before things start falling off on the man.
Perhaps you better tell him that.
- So do l.
Hi, Victor.
I' m back.
Look, guys, don' t even try it.
Why don' t you get the hell out of here?
Get the fuck away from me, man.
Very good, Victor.
Could you teach him to roll over and sit, too?
- Last time, I didn' t get the chance.
That' s cool, I' il do all the talking.
This is a very nice place, Vic.
Hi.
I like this.
This is nice.
Glad you like it.
I must make you a member.
Victor, I know that you' re into a lot of crooked shit.
And I have a pretty good idea that you had Mikey killed.
I' m going to fuck you up real bad.
ls that so?
Now listen to me, my tough little friend.
I don' t know from under what stone you crawled or where you get these ridiculous ideas about me, but it seems painfully obvious you haven' t the slightest fucking idea who you' re dealing with.
- Gotta go now, Vic.
Catch you later, Vic.
I can' t wait.
Don' t I know you guys?
You look so familiar.
Detective Foley, this is becoming very irritating.
Why are you bothering Victor Maitland?
I had a friend, Michael Tandino, who used to work for him.
Maitland had him killed.
When I can prove it you' il be the first to know.
Forget what you can prove, talk to me.
OK.
Everybody knows Victor Maitland is a hotshot art dealer.
But I poked around.
Art' s not the only thing he deals.
I saw some guys in his warehouse unloading a crate of German bearer bonds.
Michael Tandino had bonds like this on him, coincidentally, when he was killed.
Just because Maitland invests in the same bonds doesn' t mean he' s a killer.
The man' s not an investor, he' s a smuggler, be it bonds, drugs or whatever.
The crate I saw didn' t even pass through customs.
Maitland is paying to get his shipments out before they' re inspected.
When his guys get it, they take the drugs or bonds out of the crates and they send it back before customs even knows what' s going on.
- Everything except for the drugs.
But I found coffee grounds everywhere.
- What does that mean?
Drugs are packed in coffee.
The scent throws off the dogs.
Very good.
Now what do we do?
Look, Detective Foley, I...
I' d really like to help you.
lf you' d found the drugs, that' s one thing, but if your only evidence is coffee, we can' t get a search warrant.
We can get around that.
We don' t "get around" search warrants.
Taggart, I want you to start checking this out.
Start with the LAPD, the FBl and the Customs Service.
Wait a minute.
Maitland is much smarter than that.
We snoop around, he' il close down and get his shipments from elsewhere.
Really? ls that what your extensive experience tells you?
I haven' t been on the force...
- Yes, sir.
The gentleman that crashed through Victor Maitland' s window?
Who disabled an unmarked unit with a banana?
Yes, sir.
Who lured Taggart and Rosemont into a gross dereliction of duty at a striptease establishment?
It' s Rosewood, sir.
Yes, sir.
ls this the gentleman who ruined the buffet at the Harrow Club today?
Yes, sir.
I just bet you are the pride of your department in Detroit.
Lieutenant, I' d like to see you in your office.
Yes, sir.
- Can he hear me through the wall?
Yes, he can.
Rosewood, take Detective Foley back to his hotel room, watch him pack, and escort him to the city limits.
Then you can give him his gun back.
The two charges of disturbing the peace have been dropped against you.
- What?
He seems to have enough...
You want to tell that to the chief?
- Then I suggest you get moving.
Come on, Axel.
Right.
Let me check on that tomorrow and get back to you.
- Victor, hi.
- Of course not.
There' s a gentleman in town from Detroit who says he' s a friend of Michael Tandino.
He came by the office yesterday and asked me all sorts of odd questions.
Excuse me, darling.
I believe his name is Foley.
I was wondering if you knew the fellow.
We grew up in the same neighbourhood.
Really?
Have you seen him lately?
He came in yesterday.
He came by here?
And?
He told me that Mikey had been killed.
Yes, I know.
- That' s it.
He left and I haven' t seen him since.
Jenny, darling, do you know where he' s staying?
I have some information which might be helpful for him.
No, I have no idea.
- We' il have dinner soon, yes?
I read the manifests.
They' re expecting another shipment in today.
Bogomil...
This is a chance for me and you to blow this case wide open.
I wish I could, but I can' t.
Why?
Because Bogomil would kill me.
I' m not going to drive you to the art gallery.
It' s easy.
Jenny will let us in Maitland' s warehouse.
- I got a hunch.
A technique by which many crimes outside Beverly Hills get solved.
Why didn' t you tell Bogomil about this shipment?
He does everything by the book.
ls everybody in this town a robot?
This thing is very personal to me.
All he asked me to do was drive you out of town.
Now I' m going to screw that up, too.
Billy, I love you.
I just fell in love with you.
Jenny, how are you?
This is my buddy Billy Rosewood.
- How do you do?
That' s Serge.
Can you get my friend an espresso?
You want it with a lemon twist?
Sure, if it' s no bother.
No, don' t be stupid.
Victor Maitland was here asking questions about you today.
He was acting real weird.
Look, I want to get back inside the warehouse.
How about I go with you?
You' re not a cop.
lf this has to do with Mikey' s death, I want to check it out.
I don' t have time to argue with you.
Let me get my keys and we' il argue on the way.
Billy, you sit here and observe.
- Cos you' re a cop in this town.
Without probable cause, it' s an illegal search.
- You can' t...
Be cool, all right? lf anything jumps off, I' il come and get you.
ls there any chance you' il let me go in by myself?
No chance.
Fuck.
Come on.
- What are you looking for?
This.
A crate from overseas that hasn' t passed through customs yet.
What is that?
Coffee?
Yeah, it' s coffee on top.
But this ain' t sugar.
Go get Rosewood.
Welcome to the party.
It seems we have guests.
How nice.
I do like surprises.
Jeannette.
I just can' t tell you how disappointed I am to find you here.
Shut up!
I don' t want to hear it.
Take her to the car and wait for me.
What are you going to do with him?
You should be more worried about what we' re going to do with you.
Don' t worry.
We' ve got cocaine and coffee, we' re going to have a party.
Thanks for having me over, Vic.
This is very nice.
Did you say something?
lf something happens to her...
I' m all ears.
I' il kill you.
Really?
That would be a neat trick.
- Are you still pissed at me?
No.
But I should have taken care of you in Detroit.
When I popped your little buddy.
Goodbye, Mr Foley.
- I' il try.
Damn it.
Oh, boy.
How' s that little bump on the head I gave you in Detroit?
Healed up nice, I hope.
Freeze!
Thanks.
Tell Taggart to check out the warehouse.
I' il explain later.
Sergeant Taggart is here, he wants to talk to you.
Shit!
- What do you mean?
- Shit.
- What?
- Yes, sir.
Check that place out, let me know what' s going on over there.
Don' t talk to anybody but me.
Hold it, Foley.
You' re under arrest.
- No, he didn' t.
Everything he said about Maitland is right.
He' s kidnapped a woman.
- We' il have a warrant in 20 minutes.
Stop.
You' re coming with us.
I' m going inside.
You want to stop me, shoot me.
Me, too.
You can do what you want, but I' m going in.
This is really serious trouble.
- This is my last warning.
I' m sorry, Sarge.
I' ve got to.
Shit.
Wait a minute.
- Looks like East Gate.
Punch it up.
Who the hell is that?
Better get Maitland up here.
Where is everybody? ls Rosewood back?
- Seen Taggart?
He took off about 10 minutes ago.
Foley' s on the grounds.
How the hell should I know?
Get some people out there right away.
Don' t take your eyes off that screen.
Try to locate Taggart and Rosewood.
Come on.
- I can see that.
- What' s their 20?
609 Palm Canyon Road.
Who lives at that address?
A Victor Maitland, sir.
- Come on, we can do it.
Come on.
Ready, one, two... three!
You all right?
What the fuck am I doing here?
Drop it!
- Let' s go.
- These guys are serious.
I hate machine guns.
Cover me.
Go around front.
I' m going to check the back.
609 Palm Canyon Road.
- Sir?
I want all north end units to roll.
South end units stay in their area.
- Undercover officers at location.
Police!
You' re all under arrest!
Do that again, I' il shoot you myself.
Know what I keep thinking about?
Know the end of Butch Cassidy?
Redford and Newman are almost out of ammunition.
And the whole Bolivian army is out in front of this little hut.
I' m going to make you pay for this.
- Fuck, no.
Freeze it!
Hold it right there.
Shit!
Be careful, old boy, it might hit me.
Freeze!
Police!
You' re all under arrest!
Lay down your weapons and take two steps back with your hands up!
Very good.
Great.
What the hell' s going on here?
- Bleeding, sir.
How come he isn' t wearing cuffs?
Well, he isn' t actually in custody, sir.
Place him in custody.
Or would you like me to?
Wouldn' t you like to hear my report first, sir?
You have a report that explains all this?
Yes, sir.
Well, I will be very glad to hear it.
Miss Jeannette Summers, the manager of Mr Maitland' s art gallery, accidentally discovered what she suspected was cocaine in the gallery' s warehouse.
She immediately communicated her discovery to Detective Axel Foley.
Detective Foley was, at the time, cooperating in a joint Beverly Hills- Detroit investigation.
Detectives Foley and Rosewood proceeded to the warehouse where Rosewood discovered approximately 80 kilos of cocaine.
Rosewood called for back- up and I despatched our officers.
Sergeant Taggart was the first on the scene.
Believing a felony was in progress, Sergeant Taggart joined Rosewood, with Detective Foley present only as an observer, and proceeded to enter the grounds.
ln defending ourselves, we shot several suspects, including Mr Maitland.
You expect me to believe that report?
That' s the report I' m filing, sir.
Sergeant Taggart, why don' t you tell me what happened?
Happened just like the lieutenant said, Chief.
Well, I suppose congratulations are in order.
Thank you, sir.
That report better be on my desk in the morning.
Yes, sir.
First thing.
You were lying your ass off.
Go to the hospital and get your shoulder looked at.
Excuse me, sir.
Could you do me a favour, sir?
- I understand.
I just hoped you could call lnspector Todd and straighten things out for me, but that' s all right.
It' s cool.
I think I' il stay in Beverly Hills.
I' m going to start a private investigation company.
- You bet.
Thank you so much.
Hi, I' m Axel Foley checking out of suite 1035.
One moment, sir.
I' il get your bill.
Guys, you didn' t have to come to see me off, but I' m very moved.
Bogomil ordered us to make sure you got out of town.
That doesn' t matter.
What matters is that you came down here.
I' m all choked up.
I' ve got a lump in my throat.
- Thank you.
Excuse me, the Beverly Hills Police Department is picking that up.
Get outta here.
Guys, that' s the last straw.
You guys are too nice.
Do you sell those Beverly Palm robes?
- Put them on my tab.
I have to have two of them, though.
Billy, you saved my life.
I want you to have this fine Beverly Palm robe.
Each time you get in the shower, think about our friendship.
Think about Axel Foley.
I love you, Billy.
Thanks, Axel.
Here, let me take this.
You should rest that arm.
- Here you are, sir.
This is for you.
No, that' s all right.
You keep it as a souvenir.
I already have three of them in my bag.
Thank you, sir.
Not going to say goodbye?
- I figured you would.
- Then will you join me?
I don' t think so, Axel.
We' re still on duty.
I don' t think one beer' s going to kill us, Billy.
Right.
Listen to Taggart.
Lighten up.
One drink' s not going to kill us.
- Don' t worry, just follow my lead.
Trust me.
English
Between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis... and the rise of the sons of Arius, there was an age undreamed of, when shining kingdoms lay spread across the world.
Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, sword in hand.
It is I, his chronicler, who knows well his saga.
Now let me tell you of the days of high adventure.
- I think we made the merchant angry!
- Are you surprised?
But we didn' t steal everything he had.
We didn' t have time.
Why aren' t they trying to kill us?
Maybe they want to capture us, then torture us to death.
Conan, help!
Help!
- Do you know who I am?
- Taramis!
- Queen Taramis.
- Not my queen.
You have a queen?
But you are a Cimmerian.
The Cimmerian' s have no rulers.
You live free in the world.
You owe allegiance to no one.
Is that not so?
It is, and it always will be.
- What do you want?
- I need your help.
- No!
- No?
- You don' t know what I' d be willing to give if you help.
- You have nothing that I want.
You were praying, Conan.
What were you praying for?
Look at the shrine.
See what you are praying for.
What is there, Conan?
Think.
Show me the desire in your deepest heart.
Valeria.
Where is this Valeria?
With Crom.
- She sits by the side of my god.
What I want, you cannot give me.
Yes I can.
You can bring back the dead?
Do as I ask of you, and I will.
Wake...
and remember.
Tell me what I must do.
Soon.
Doesn' t that animal look familiar?
I think it does.
I' m sorry about what happened the last time.
They love us!
We will drink to Dagoth, the Dreaming God.
What do you want me to do for you?
- That will bring back the woman you love?
It is her destiny.
My niece, Jehnna, has such a mark.
- I want you to take her on that journey.
- To where?
Jehnna will show you.
From the day she was born, she' s been prepared for this.
There is a key she must find -- a key only she can touch -- as it was written in the Scrolls of Skelos.
- Where is it?
- In a castle.
- Guarded.
- By a wizard.
Thoth- Amon.
- By a wizard?
- That frightens you.
You' re afraid of magic.
And you will have to deal with it.
- What good is a sword against sorcery?
No.
I will find a way.
What does this key unlock?
A treasure.
Only she can procure it.
Only she can lead you to it.
And when she has it, you' il bring her back to me.
Then you will have your reward.
We shall both have everything we want... through magic.
No!
It' s all right.
Don' t be afraid.
- It' s only a dream.
- No!
I saw -- - A dream.
Jehnna, it was only a dream.
Lie down.
- I- I saw it!
- No, you saw -- - I saw it again!
- I did!
- Imaginings out of excitement.
- Go back to sleep.
- I saw it again.
Tomorrow, you' il start your journey.
You' il need all your strength.
Your destiny is at hand.
- Sleep.
Sleep.
All our destinies are at hand, even Conan' s, though he doesn' t yet know it.
We don' t need him, my queen.
I don' t need the Captain of the Guard to steal a key.
That is a task for a thief.
What I do need you for, is to see that this dear child is returned safely to the palace... with both the treasure and her virginity intact.
I will protect them both.
You better, my friend, for she must be a virgin when she' s returned to me... so she can be properly sacrificed.
One other thing, Bombaata.
I want your sword in Conan' s heart.
They will strike at the right moment to help you.
Conan must die.
Do you think he' s handsome?
Very ugly.
No, not him.
Conan.
Can' t you judge for yourself?
But how can I?
How many times have I seen a man?
A real man?
All I' ve seen is you.
Meaning no insult to you, Bombaata.
Yes, he is handsome.
Conan, wait!
We must go this way.
- Not yet.
- But you have to obey me.
Weren' t you told?
There are rules to every game.
I believe you, but there' s magic in this game.
You' il have to be able to fight it with magic.
Akiro.
- What are they going to do?
- Have lunch.
Those savages should thank me for sparing them a terrible stomach- ache.
Why would they want to eat someone as old and as sour as you?
They thought if they digested me, my magic would be in their blood.
At least they could have washed you first.
I need you.
I' m yours.
Tell me more about this key.
Oh, it' s not an ordinary key.
- It' s a jewel.
- A jewel?
Yes.
The heart of Ahirman.
- Well, can it be worn?
- Only by me.
No one else dare touch it.
If there is anything here that you like... try not to take it.
I know when to steal... and when not to.
Get her.
Get her!
- What did she do?
- She came with the bandits to raid our village.
The others are dead.
Now it' s her turn, after we have our fun with her.
- Don' t kill her too soon!
- Save her!
- Thieves should be hanged.
Conan, there are six of them against her.
One, two, three -- I think you' re right.
And she' s tied to the stake!
Do something!
Stop.
I think we made a friend.
Wait here.
- What do you want?
- To come with you.
Be off!
Let me speak to Conan.
I said be off!
Stop!
Leave.
I will give my life for him.
We shall see.
The castle of Thoth- Amon.
It holds the key.
Come bring her, Conan.
- We leave now.
- In the morning.
I' m the leader here.
It will be better.
- We must rest.
- My thinking exactly.
Sleep.
The first to do so in a thousand years.
Look!
Jehnna.
Jehnna!
Jehnna!
Akiro, where is she?
In there!
- Who took her?
- A giant bird.
A bird of smoke.
Into the boat!
Somebody should stay and watch the horses.
Malak!
I didn' t mean me!
I' m rowing.
Too late, my friends, but come.
Come anyway.
How do we get in?
Is there another entrance?
Under here is a way in.
You mean under the water?
You can stay here if you like.
Alone?
They need me.
Be careful.
Wizard it open.
Fine magician you are.
Go back to juggling apples.
- Get up, Conan!
Exactly.
There are only two left, Wizard.
And you' re behind one of them.
Which one?
No!
No!
Not here!
Bombaata?
Bombaata?
Bombaata!
Bombaata!
I need you!
Bombaata!
- Bombaata!
It' s all right.
- Hurry!
- Run!
Bombaata!
All an illusion.
Help!
Help me!
Bombaata, where are you?
Put me down, do you hear me?
Bombaata, stop!
Why?
I thought you were going to hurt the girl.
This is one of the queen' s guards!
Why did they attack us?
Not by her order.
Wait, wait.
This is much better.
Akiro' s own magic mixture.
Let me help you.
- What do you think you' re doing?
- Covering your wound.
- My wound is lower.
- We don' t want an infection to spread.
I' il spread your head open.
This is what the world has come to.
You try to help somebody... and what do you get instead of thanks?
Threats.
Now yell if it hurts.
I suppose nothing hurts you.
Only pain.
After we return to Shadizar, what will you do?
I' il find my kingdom, and a queen to sit beside me.
What kingdom?
I was "kingdomed."
The kingdom I was promised.
- What queen?
- Valeria.
- Valeria.
- Valeria.
Do you see this woman over there?
- Zula?
- Valeria is like her.
She doesn' t look like her, but she has the same spirit.
The same, uh --
Strength?
Strength.
And she' s a warrior too?
A great warrior... and a great woman.
Could there ever be... anyone else but her?
Lot on your knife.
Not... on your life.
I must get up now.
How do you feel?
Welcome.
You are welcome.
I didn' t know women could be warriors.
All my tribe are warriors.
Some.
Do you think that I could ever be one?
Yes!
Please!
Now, the power is in the wrists.
Oh, I see.
They' ve got to stay loose.
- It takes practice and strength.
Wait!
Not with a toothpick.
I' il show you.
Stand like this.
Yes.
You do it.
Try it.
- Oh!
Swing over your head.
Good.
Now you' re ready to take on anybody.
How do you attract a man?
What would you do to get him?
And take him.
You' d grab him, and... and take him.
Take him!
Like that.
- What did she mean?
- What did she say?
Well, she said that if she wanted a man, she' d, she' d reach out and take him.
Good idea.
But then what?
What do you do with him?
You see, you just --
Well, they have to... to join.
- Join.
- Uh --
Uh... get together.
You see, he has to take his... his, uh, uh -- and grab her by the --
Joined.
I mean, how do you think flowers grow?
- Through this?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- We can' t go around it?
- I go where I feel myself led.
So I' ve noticed.
That way.
Shouldn' t one of us go back and stand guard?
Bombaata.
Together.
Here.
Let me help.
Malak, go inside and see if there' s a lock.
- You mean in there?
I found something.
Easy.
"It is written in the Scrolls of Skelos...
"by a woman child, a virgin,
"who will have a mark upon her.
"Dagoth will arise.
The woman child will be sacrificed. "
- Stop her!
The whole world -- - Be silent!
Crom!
Death to the world.
Life for Valeria.
The girl' s destiny isn' t only to deliver the horn.
It' s just writing on a wall.
She is to be killed.
Sacrificed!
We shall see.
Destiny or not.
Everybody out.
- Out!
It' s worth a fortune.
- We come in peace.
- Then let us go in peace.
Let the girl come forward.
We' ve been waiting for her all our lives.
We are the keepers of the horn.
It belongs to us.
- No longer.
- Who are you?
- Conan.
- I have heard of you.
- You know the legend written on the wall of the crypt?
- From the day of my birth.
You know what will happen if the horn is placed back in the forehead of Dagoth.
And we who give him life will stand by his right hand... and rule the world with him.
You will die in the great evil that will come from his rebirth!
We will control him.
No one is able to control him!
His power and his evil are too great!
Give us the girl, or we' il take her.
Enough talk!
Back to the crypt!
- Bombaata!
Get out!
Behind the dragon there' s a tunnel.
It could be our only way out.
The jewel.
Take the jewel!
Hurry.
That way.
Malak!
Malak, come on!
Malak!
It' s the leader!
He' s a wizard.
He' s forcing the mouth open!
Well, stop him!
Kill him or something!
My dagger is gone.
You kill him!
Not me.
It' s bad luck to kill a wizard.
Wait.
There is a better way to take care of a wizard.
- Well done, Akiro.
Enter the tunnel.
- Don' t stop.
Hurry!
Run.
Run!
- They are coming.
Don' t worry.
Go.
- They' ve gone.
- And taken their horses.
- Or been captured.
- Wait.
Bombaata took her.
Taramis planned it from the beginning.
We get the horn, her guards will kill us, and Bombaata takes the girl and the horn back to her.
And her promise to you?
- Where are we going?
- To Shadizar.
- What for?
- To stop Jehnna' s sacrifice.
But it' s her destiny.
It can' t be stopped.
You don' t have to come.
- I will.
- I will.
I won' t!
I mean, what' s in it for us?
Some charitable institution?
Go!
I won' t help.
Hey!
You know you can' t do without me!
Wait, Conan.
Wait!
Do you have the treasure?
Bring it to me.
Reserves to guard the palace.
There must be hundreds of them around.
We can' t get in there.
Well, you can' t say we didn' t try.
The front gate cannot be the only way to get in.
Oh, it isn' t.
Malak?
Behind the waterfall, there' s an entrance.
It used to be an exit.
My cousin' s sister' s brother dug his way out there... when he was a prisoner at Shadizar.
Today is your birthday.
All of Shadizar is celebrating.
Drink.
To life!
For Dagoth.
For Dagoth.
Oh, Dagoth.
God of gods.
My cousin' s sister' s brother never said anything about bars.
How do we get back up?
The bars were put up after your sister' s brother' s cousin escaped.
Cousin' s sister' s brother.
How many times do I have to tell you that?
- You said sister' s brother' s cousin.
- Who cares whose it is!
- What difference does it make?
At the first sign of life in our god, the girl must be sacrificed.
Or as the Scrolls of Skelos say, "A catastrophe will befall us."
Oh, Dagoth.
God of gods.
Power above all power.
Kill her!
Save the girl!
Kill her!
She must be sacrificed!
- Get back!
- Down the steps!
No!
His horn is his life!
Tear out the horn!
- Zula.
I need a Captain of the Guards.
I see no reason why a woman wouldn' t do as well as a man.
- You.
Come here.
I understand that every king or queen must have a fool.
- Do I qualify?
More than qualify.
Will the world' s greatest wizard come forward, please?
At your service.
One cannot rule without wisdom.
- Let me instruct you in the fine arts of mystical -- - Later.
Rule Shadizar with me.
I will have my own kingdom; my own queen.
At length, he sought adventure in distant lands... and trod the jeweled thrones of the earth... beneath his sandaled feet... until, at last, he found his own kingdom... and wore his crown upon a troubled brow.
- Morning, Scott.
- Morning, Ben - Morning, Wells.
Ghost Rider, this is Strike.
Inbound Mustang, you' re in Vector 090 for bogey.
- Who' s up there?
- Cougar & Merlin, and Maverick & Goose.
Great.
Maverick and Goose.
- Talk to me, Goose.
- Roger, I got them.
20 left at 30 miles, 900 knots closure.
- Roger.
- Merlin, you got them?
- Roger, I' ve got radar contact.
- I' il get a visual ID, Cougar.
- Roger, an 'I' il clean' em and fry 'em.
Mystang, this is Ghost Rider, 203.
I got them inbound, bogey heading 270 at 10 miles.
- Ghostrider, take angels 10, left, 3, 0.
- Are we supposed to have visitors today?
- Negative, sir.
- Merlin, see if he' s a single.
- Goose, do you see a trailer?
- Negative, Merlin.
Looks like he' s a single.
- Cougar, I' m gonna go head- to- head with him.
- Take it easy, Maverick, I don' t like this shit..
I' m gonna break high & right, see if he' s really alone.
- We got a 1000- knot closure, Mav.
He' s coming right at us.
What' s on your mind?
- Shit, there' s two of them.
MiG- 28s!
- What the hell are they doing?
What' s their position?
- 250 miles out, sir.
- 250 miles?, get 'em out of here!
Cougar, you' ve got MiG one.
I lost him in the sun!
Shit, what' s he doing?
You got him, Merlin?
He' s coming around, he' s coming around on our tail!
Goddamn it.
- What' s their range now?
- 200 miles, sir.
- If they break 150 miles, launch the alert- five aircraft.
- Airspeed 300.
Go get them, Mav!
- I' m going for missile lock.
Let' s see if we can scare him this guy out of here.
I' ve got him locked.
He' s bugging out and going home.
- Mustang, this is Maverick.
MiG two is headed home.
- Alright, what' s their position?
- 180 miles and bearing 010, sir.
Get away from this guy!
- What the hell is this shit?, he' s engaging me.
Goddamn it.
Mustang, this is Ghostrider 117, this bogey' s all over me.
- He' s got missile lock on me, do I have permission to fire?
- Do not fire until fired upon.
- Goose, there they are.
And he' s right on Cougar' s tale.
He would have fired by now.
He' s just trying to piss us off.
- Maverick, get down here and get this asshole off me!
Easy, Cougar.
Bring him back, hard right.
I can' t shoot this son of a bitch.
Let' s see if we can have a little fun with him.
Is this your idea of fun, Mav?
Greetings.
Watch the birdie.
Geez, I crack myself up.
This is a great shot, Mav.
I should be a photographer.
Cougar, your tail is clear.
Cougar, this is Maverick.
We' ve had enough fun for one day, don' t you think?
I' m getting a lil 'low on fuel, so we' re heading home.
We' il see you on deck.
Cougar, we' re running low on gas, we gotta get outta here.
We' re on vapour, Cougar.
Cougar, come on, Cougar!
- Let' s take it back to the ship, man.
Come on, Cougar.
- Get him on deck as soon as possible, he' s gotta be low on fuel.
We are way low on gas you understand me?
Are you all right, man?
- Maverick, you' re 3/ 4 to fall out, call the ball.
Maverick has the ball.
- Goose, Cougar' s in trouble.
- Come on, Mav, we' re getting low on gas, let' s land this sucker.
- What' re you doing, Mav?
We' ve got no fuel for this.
We' re going after Cougar.
- You tell him to land that plane.
That' s an order!
Land immediately.
Any of you boys seen an aircraft carrier around here?
I don' t think he can make it back.
Just stay on my wing.
Just stay with me.
Just a walk in the park, buddy.
You' re a little low, Coug.
Come on, buddy, pull up.
Pull up, Cougar.
That' s it.
3/ 4 over now, call the ball.
Rogerball.
You' re too low.
You' re too low, Cougar!
Come in.
- Cougar, you should be in a sickbed, what' s on your mind?
- My wife and kid, sir.
I almost orphaned him today., and I' ve never even seen him.
- I don' t know what happened up there, but I was so scared.
- Come on, we' ve seen this before.
No, sir.
I' ve lost the edge.
I' m sorry, sir.
Cougar?
Thanks, Maverick.
Maverick, Goose, come in here.
- What the hell' s going on?
- I don' t know.
- Shit.
Maverick, you just did an incredibly brave thing.
You don' t own that plane, the taxpayers do!
Son, your ego' s writing cheques your body can' t cash.
You' ve been busted, you' ve lost your qualifications as section leader three times.
Put in hack twice by me with a history of high- speed passes...... over five air control towers and one admiral' s daughter!
- Penny Benjamin?
- You, asshole, you' re lucky to be here.
- Thank you, sir.
You need to be doing it better and cleaner than the other guy, now what is it with you?
- Just want to serve my country, be the best fighter pilot in the Navy, sir.
Maybe too good.
I' d like to bust your butt, but I can' t...... I got another problem here.
I gotta do something.
I still can' t believe it.
I' m gonna send you up against the best.
You two characters are going to Top Gun.
For five weeks you' re going to fly against the best pilots in the world.
Cougar lost it, turned in his wings.
You screw up just this much, you' il be flying a cargo plane full of rubber dog shit out of Hong Kong.
Yes, sir!
That is all.
Tell me about the MiG some other time.
- Good luck, gentlemen.
- Thank you.
We shot down 12 of their jets for every one of ours.
Our pilots become dependant upon missiles.
They lost some of their dog- fighting skills.
Now, Top Gun was created to teach ACM - "Air Combat Manoeuvring".
- This gives me a hard- on.
- By the end of Vietnam, that ratio was back to 12 to 1.
- Don' t tease me.
- Blinds, please.
I' d like to take this opportunity to introduce you to our commanding officer at Top Gun.... very first man to win the Top Gun trophy.
You will not find a finer fighter pilot anywhere in the world.
Commander Mike Metcalf.
- Call sign, Viper.
The elite.
We' il make you better.
You fly at least two combat missions a day, attend classes inbetween, and evaluations of your performance.
Every encounter is gonna be much more difficult.
And more dangerous.
Now, we don' t make policy here, gentlemen.
Elected officials, civilians, do that.
We are the instruments of that policy, and although we are not at war, we must always act as though we are at war.
- What are you doing?
- Just wondering who' s the best.
In case some of you wonder who the best is, they' re here on this plaque on the wall.
The best driver and his RlO from each class has his name on it.
And they have the option to come back here to be Top Gun instructors.
Yes, sir.
That' s pretty arrogant, considering the company you' re in.
- Yes, sir.
- I like that in a pilot.
Remember, when it' s over out there, we' re all on the same team.
There are no points for second place.
- Dismissed.
The plaque for the alternates is down in the ladies' room.
You kill me.
You really do.
- This is what I call a target- rich environment.
- You live your life between your legs, Mav.
Goose, even you could get laid in a place like this.
I' d be happy to find a girl who' d talk dirty to me.
Mav, you wanted to know who the best is?
Iceman.
No mistakes.
You get bored, frustrated, you do something stupid, and he' s got you.
- Hey, hey, Slider.
What happened?
Whose butt did you kiss to get here?
- The list is long but distinguished.
- Yeah, so is my johnson.
- So you' re flying with lceman, huh.
- It' s Mr. Iceman for you.
- Hey, Mother Goose, how' s it going?
Doing good.
Tom, this is Pete Mitchell.
Tom Kazansky.
- Thank you.
- Sorry to hear about Cougar...... you know, we were like brothers in fight school.
- Still is a good man.
- Yeah, that' s what I meant.
- So, you need any help?
- With what?
- You figured it out yet?
- What' s that?
- Who' s the best pilot.
- No, I think I can figure that one out on my own.
You like to work alone.
I mean, first the MiG and then you slide into Cougar' s spot...
We didn' t slide into Cougar' s spot, it was ours, ok.
Guess you guys are lucky and famous, huh.
I' il see you later.
- You can count on it.
- They were abused children.
- We' re gonna have a good time.
Okay, I guess it' s my turn, isn' t it?
All right, the bet is 20 dollars.
You have to have carnal knowledge, of a lady this time, on the premises.
- On the premises.
- Come on, Mav... a bet' s a bet.
I don' t know, it just doesn' t seem fair... for you, I mean.
She' s lost that loving feeling.
- Yes, she has.
- She has not lost that lo...
- Goose, she' s lost it, man.
- I hate it when she does that.
Don' t worry.
I' il take care of this.
You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips...... there' s no tenderness like before in your fingertips...
You' re trying hard not to show it, baby...... but baby, believe me, I know that...
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
I' ve never seen that approach.
How long have you two been doing this act?
- I don' t know.
- Puberty?
- Right, puberty.
- I' m Maverick.
- "Maverick"?
Did your mother not like you or something?
- No, it' s my call sign.
- You' re a pilot!
A naval aviator.
- Actually, we' ve only done this twice.
- Crashed and burned on the first one, it wasn' t pretty.
- And the second?
I don' t know, I' il tell you tomorrow.
Well, "Maverick"... my friend just arrived, so it' s been great talking to you.
I' il be with you in just a second, ok.
- Listen, can I ask you a personal question?
- That depends.
- Are you a good pilot?
Great.
Then I won' t have to worry about you making your living as a singer.
I' m gonna need a beer to put these flames out.
Real slick.
- A long cruise, was it, sailor?
What you wanna do, just drop by down on the tile and go for it?
I actually had this counter in mind.
- That would be very, very comfortable, yeah.
Actually, I came in here to save you from making a big mistake with that older guy.
So I could go on to a bigger one with a young guy like yourself?
Maybe.
- I have to get up early in the morning.
Your friend was magnificent.
You' il also be trained and evaluated by civilian specialists.
The civilians are hre because they are our very best source of information on enemy aircraft.
And she' s also a civilian contract, so you do not salute her.
But you better listen to her, because the Pentagon listens to her about your proficiency.
Hello.
We will be dealing with F- 5s and A- 4s as our MiG simulators.
Now, then, as most of you know, the F- 5 doesn' t have the thrust- to- weight ratio of the MiG- 28.
And it doesn' t bleed energy below 300 knots like the MiG- 28.
However, the MiG- 28 does have a problem with its inverted flight tanks.
The latest intelligence tells us the most it will do is 1 negative...
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Is there something wrong?
The data on the MiG is inaccurate.
- How' s that, Lieutenant?
- Sorry, Goose.
We happened to see a MiG- 28 do a 4 G negative dive.
Where did you see this?
- It' s what?
It' s classified.
Lieutenant, I have Top Secret clearance.
The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
- Well, ma' am, it doesn' t seem so in this case now, does it?.
- So, Lieutenant... where exactly were you?
Well, we started up on his six when he pulled through the clouds.
If you were directly above him, how could you see him?
- Because I was inverted.
- Bullshit.
He was inverted.
You were in a 4 G inverted dive with a MiG- 28?
- Yes, ma' am.
- About two metres?
- Well, it was actually about 1/ 2, I think.
- It was a nice picture.
- What were you doing there?
- Communicating.
Keeping up foreign relations.
- I was, you know, giving him the bird.
- You know, the finger.
- I know the finger, Goose.
- I' m sorry, I hate it when it does that.
- So you' re the one?
- Yes, ma' am.
- All right, we have a hop to take.
The hard- deck on this hop will be 10, 000 feet.
There' il be no engagement below that.
Lieutenant!
Okay, don' t be late again.
You look great, honey.
Lieutenant, why didn' t you tell me you were the famous MiG lnsulter?
- Would it have made any difference?
- Not in the ladies' room, no.
I' m an instructor at this school, I see 20 new hotshots every eight weeks.
Now, I' m sure you can figure that out.
I' d just really like to hear about the MiG sometime.
You' ve got security clearance.
Who was covering Cougar while you were showboating with this MiG?
Cougar was doing just fine.
Gentlemen, this is your first hop.
The jets you' re flying against are smaller and faster and more manoeuvreable.
Clock is ticking, and as of now we are keeping score.
- I lost him, Goose.
- I lost him.
- I' m looking.
I' m looking.
- I got him, I got him.
Here we go.
- He' s still back there.
He' s closing in on us.
He' s closing fast.
You can run, kid, but you can' t hide.
All right, Jester, I' il give you a run for your money here.
Watch the mountains!
Come on, Mav, do some of that pilot shit.
I got 'im.
- Come on, bring it right.
- I' ve had about enough of this shit.
- When I hit the brakes, he' il fly right by.
- You' re mine.
- Ok, man.
Let' s turn and burn.
So am l.
- We' re going ballistic, man.
He' s going for the hard- deck.
Let' s get down there first and nail him, Mav.
You' re mine.
I' ve got you now!
- Jester' s dead.
Get your butts above the hard- deck and return to base.
Yes, sir!
- Tower, this is Ghost Rider requesting a fly- by.
- Negative, Ghost Rider.
The pattern is full.
- No, no, Mav.
This is not a good idea.
- Sorry, Goose... but it' s time to buzz the tower.
Goddamn son of a bitch!
Great balls of fire.
- You won?
Bullshit.
- Didn' t everybody?.
We got our butts kicked.
We went like this, he went like that...... I said to Hollywood, "Where did he go?"
Hollywood said, "Where did who go?"
We won.
- All right!
- They won too, man.
- No, we did.
- Below the hard- deck doesn' t count.
- Hard- deck my ass, we nailed that son of a bitch.
- What' s your problem, Kazansky?
You' re everyone' s problem.
That' s because every time you go up in the air, you' re unsafe.
- I don' t like you because you' re dangerous.
- That' s right, lceman.
I am dangerous.
Maverick.
You and Goose get your butts outta that flight gear and up to Viper' s office, now!
Remember boys, no points for second place.
- You' re a lot brighter than you look.
- Don' t worry, don' t worry.
Two of your snot- nosed jockeys did a fly- by at my tower at over 400 knots.
I want somebody' s butt, I want it now, I' ve had it.
Goddamn it, that' s twice.
- Well, that' il just about cover the fly- bys.
- Follow me.
You had a hell of a first day.
The hard- deck for this hop was 10, 000 feet.
You followed Commander Heatherly below after he lost sight of you.
Why?
Sir, I had Commander Heatherly in my sights.
He saw me move in for the kill...... he then proceeded below the hard- deck.
We weren' t below 10, 000 for more than a few seconds.
There was no danger, so I took it.
You took it, and broke a major rule of engagement.
Then you broke another one with that circus stunt fly- by.
Lieutenant Mitchell, Top Gun rules of engagement exist for your safety and for that of your team.
Either obey them or you are history.
Is that clear?
Dismissed.
I really enjoyed that, Mav, thanks a lot.
Holy shit.
Maybe I could learn how to be a truck driver.
I might need that.
State in those reports says it all.
He' s a wild card.
Completely unpredictable.
- He got you, didn' t he?
I flew with his old man.
- Tell me one thing... if you had to go into battle, would you want him with you?
- I don' t know.
I just don' t know.
- Still awake?
- Yeah.
- What' s up?
- Can' t sleep.
You kow, when I realised we were going to Top Gun, all I could think about was getting that trophy.
Right now, I just hope we graduate.
I got a family to think about.
I guess that fly- by wasn' t such a big hit, huh?
Look, man, I know it' s tough for you.
You have to live with that reputation.
But it' s like everytime we go up there, it' s like you' re flying against a ghost.
It makes me nervous.
You' re the only family I' ve got.
I promise.
Get out of here.
A rolling reversal would work well in that situation.
If I reversed on a hard cross, I could immediately go to guns on him.
But at that speed, it' s too fast.
It' s a little bit too aggressive.
Too aggressive?
Yeah, I guess when I see something, I go right after it.
- You didn' t tell me who you were the other night.
You deserved it.
I know... but uh... you were tempted... to ask me out for dinner.
- No?
- No.
I don' t date students.
I can see it' s dangerous for you.
But if the government trusts me...... maybe you could.
It takes a lot more than just fancy flying.
Crash and burn, huh, Mav?.
Slider...
You stink.
Let' s go!
Come on, Mav.
Just one more game.
That evens it up.
Just one more game.
- Please?
- I' m sorry.
- You' re sorry...
Come on...
Damn it.
Lieutenant?
- What?
No singing?
- Look, I' m...
No apologies.
I' m just gonna take a quick shower while you' re finishing up here.
I' m hungry.
And then I thought about it.
"Why don' t you just tell him why you' ve got him here?"
It' s the MiG.
You' re the only pilot who' s been up against a MiG- 28.
I' m trying for this big promotion.
Seems to me you' ve got it all figured out.
Except you did forget the wine.
- You always get what you want?
- No, not always.
Yeah, maybe.
Then relax about the MiG.
This music...
An old friend?
My folks loved it.
I haven' t heard this in years.
My mother used to call from her room and have me play this over and over again...... I got so sick of it.
She' d sit up there alone, just listening for hours.
She died shortly after him.
What happened to your father?
I guess I kinda figured with your security clearance you' d know more about it than I do.
Well, I didn' t get that far.
Well, that' s a big mystery.
He disappeared in an F- 4, November 5th, 1965.
The stink of it was... he screwed up.
No way.
My old man was a great fighter pilot.
It' s all classified.
- Somebody must know.
- Yeah, somebody knows everything.
Is that why you' re always second best up there?
You are direct, aren' t you.
I' m sorry I was late.
- I' m sorry for being direct.
- No apologies.
This is going to be complicated.
- Where are you going?
- I' m gonna take a shower.
Thank you.
I enjoyed being here.
It looks like you need another shower.
Right.
I' m gonna be honest with you.
Your MiG sighting is really important to my work, but uh...
I don' t normally invite students to my house.
But please understand, I still have a job to do.
I' m glad we got that straight.
I told her how tough it is here.
You know, my ass dragging like an old tired dog.
I told her you didn' t even have a woman here.
She said, "Oh, he probably doesn' t have 1, he' s got 8."
- Daddy.
- Is that right?
- I didn' t tell her that.
I can' t believe you said that.
Freeze frame.
A moment of choice.
He has a chance to bug out right here.
Better to retire and save your aircraft than push a bad position.
Now, you stay in that diamond another three seconds...... the bogey' s gonna blow you out in the sky.
You made a bad choice.
- Charlie?
- Aircraft one performs a split S?
That' s the last thing you should do.
The MiG' s right on your tail.
Freeze there, please.
The MiG has you in his gunsight.
What were you thinking at this point?
You don' t have time to think up there.
If you think, you' re dead.
That' s a big gamble with a $30- million dollar plane, Lieutenant.
Unfortunately, the gamble worked.
The MiG never got a clean shot.
Maverick makes an aggressive vertical move here, comes over the top, and he defeats the bandit with a missile shot.
The encounter was a victory, but I think we have show it as an example of what not to do.
Next.
Gutsiest move I ever saw, man.
Now then, this is a perfect example of a textbook manoeuvre.
Lieutenant?
My review of your performance was right on, in my professional opinion.
I can' t hear you.
Jesus Christ!
And you think I 'm reckless!
When I fly, my crew and my plane come first.
- Well, I' m gonna finish my sentence, Lieutenant.
My review of your flight performance was right on.
- That is right.
But I held something back.
I see some real genius in your flying, Maverick, but I can' t say that in there.
I was afraid that everyone in that tacts training would see right through me.
I just don' t want anyone to know that I' ve fallen for you.
You hear about lce?
- What' s that?
- Really?
- Yeah.
- I fell the need...... the need for speed.
Multiple aircraft, multiple bogeys.
Your training is half- over.
The competltion for the Top Gun trophy remains tight.
Second place, Maverick.
Three miles, left, 10 o' clock.
I don' t think they see us yet.
Two A- 4s.
Left 10 o' clock level.
Continue left turn.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
The temperature is 110 degrees...
It' s Viper!
- Viper' s up here?
Great.
- Great.
He' s probably saying, "Holy shit, it' s Maverick and Goose."
- Yeah, I' m sure he' s saying that.
- I' ve got my eye on the northern bogey.
- Roger, I' ve got the southern guy.
Hollywood, you got the lead, I' il cover you.
Break now, Jester.
- Hollywood, we' re losing Viper.
Let' s just stay on Jester.
- Roger, I' m on 'im.
He' s out there somewhere.
- Stay with Hollywood, Mav, we' re covering his wing.
Three o' clock low.
- Stay with Hollywood, Mav, we' re his cover.
- Don' t you leave me, Mav.
- Hollywood, you' re looking good.
I' m going after Viper.
- Goddamn you, Maverick!
- Mav, don' t leave him.
Goose, Hollywood' s okay.
Viper' s coming down.
We' re head- to- head.
I can' t believe we' re doing this.
Here' s our chance, it' s a big one, Goose.
Come on, goddamn it.
Come on, keep coming.
Okay, sidewinder missile selected.
Come on, baby.
That' s it.
Where' s he going?
- Come on, come on.
Damn, this kid' s good.
I' m switching to guns.
Check our tail.
- Shit, there' s Jester!
Bingo, Maverick' s dead.
The Defence Department regrets to inform you your sons are dead because they were stupid.
Let' s go home.
Viper has the lead.
That was some of the best flying I' ve seen yet.
You never, never leave your wingman.
It' s not your flying, it' s your attitude.
The enemy' s dangerous, but right now you' re worse than the enemy.
You' re dangerous and foolish.
You may not like who' s flying with you, they may not like you... but whose side are you on?
We' ve still got a shot at it.
That was stupid, I know better than that.
That will never happen again.
I know...
I know.
Doesn' t he ever embarrass you?
- Goose?, hell no.
Well, there was the time...
- Admiral' s daughter.
- What?!
He told me all about the time you went ballistic with Penny Benjamin.
That' s great...
He tells me about all of them.
How my lil 'angel Goose goes home early for church...
- Alright.
Thank you, Carole.
I' m gonna go embarrass myself with Goose for a while.
I' d love to be able to warn you off about Maverick, but I just love him to death.
- There are hearts breaking wide open all over the world tonight.
- Why?
Because, unless you are a fool, that boy is off the market.
He is 100% prime- time in love with you.
- Hey, Goose, you big stud.
- That' s me, honey.
- Take me to bed or lose me forever.
Show me the way home, honey.
Come on, brother, sing with the family.
Maverick, you big stud...
Take me to bed or lose me forever.
Okay, gentlemen, this is hop 31.
Two weeks to graduation.
The Top Gun trophy is still up for grabs, so every point counts.
It' s time for the big one.
- You up for this one, Maverick?
- Just a walk in the park, Cazansky.
Two miles.
Looks like they' re going away from us.
- Oh, I see 'em.
Right, two o' clock.
That son of a bitch cut me off.
Jesus Christ, lce, take the shot.
- Come on, Ice.
Get the hell out of there.
I' m too close for missiles.
I' m switching to guns.
Ice, fire or clear!
Jesus Christ, I can take a shot right here.
- I need another 20 seconds and I' ve got him.
I' ve got the shot.
- Come on, Mav, let' s get in there.
Come on, Mav!
- Maverick' s getting impatient.
Now, come on, take the shot.
- 10 more seconds, then I' ve got 'im.
- Come on, get the hell out of there.
Let' s do it, Mav.
- Ice, Come off my right.
- Five more seconds.
I' m in.
I' m off.
Shit.
We' re in a jetwash.
Shit!
Engine one is out...
Engine two is out.
I can' t control it!
This is not good!
Mav' s in trouble.
He' s in a flat spin heading out to sea!
Altitude 8, 000... 7, 000...
We' re at 6, 000!
I can' t reach the ejection handle!
- You' re gonna have to punch us out.
- I can' t reach the ejection handle!
- Watch the canopy!
Oh, no!
Oh, God.
You' ve got to let him go, sir.
- How are you doing?
- I' m all right.
- Goose is dead.
- I know.
You fly jets long enough, something like this happens.
He was my RlO, my responsibility.
In my squadron in Vietnam, we lost 8 of 18 aircraft.
The first one dies, you die too.
You can count on it.
You' ve got to let him go.
You' ve got to let him go.
I think maybe it was my fault.
I don' t know what the hell went wrong.
I' d like to help.
I know it' s difficult.
God, I want him back.
I' il be here if you need me, okay?
God, he loved flying with you, Maverick.
He would have flown anyway... without you.
He' d' ve hated it, but he would have done it.
We find that the F- 14 flatspin was induced by the disruption of air flow into the starboard engine.
This disruption stalled the engine...... which produced enough yaw rate to induce a spin...... which was unrecoverable.
There was no way Lieutenant Mitchell could see or avoid the jetwash which produced the engine stall.
Therefore, the Board of lnquiry finds Lieutenant Mitchell was not at fault in the accident of 29th of July.
Lieutenant Mitchell' s restored to flight status without further delay.
These proceedings are closed.
Get him up flying, soon.
- Come on, kid, come on.
Engage.
- Alright, you' ve got a bogey at two o' clock low, Maverick.
You got the angle, piece of cake now.
Take the shot.
You can engage any time, Maverick.
Where the hell are you going?
It doesn' t look good.
It doesn' t get to look any better than that.
Hey!
I' il fire when I' m goddamn good and ready.
- He can' t get back in the saddle, he won' t engage.
- It' s only been a few days.
You know, he just might not make it back.
Mitchell?
I' m sorry about Goose.
Everybody liked him.
I' m sorry.
Hi, it' s Wolfman.
Maverick just quit.
Excuse me...
- May l?
- Please.
Hemlock, is it?
Ice water.
You weren' t gonna say goodbye?
I heard you got that job in Washington.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
But I wasn' t gonna leave without saying goodbye.
- It' s good to see you.
Where are you going?
You don' t even have a ticket, do you?
Listen, I' ve seen all the evidence, and it' s not your responsibility.
It' s not your fault.
You' re one of the best pilots in the Navy.
- But you' ve got to go on.
- You don' t understand.
When I first met you, you were larger than life.
Look at you.
You' re not gonna be happy unless you' re going Mach 2 with your hair on fire, you know that.
No, that' s over.
It' s just over.
To be the best of the best means you make mistakes and then you go on, it' s just like the rest of us.
You don' t think I know that?
I' m here to help.
Look, thank you.
I would have asked for it.
So, I' m too late.
You' ve already left.
Except to quit.
You' ve got that manoeuvre down real well.
So long, Pete Mitchell.
Oh, hi, Maverick, come on in.
- Good - Yeah?
- Great.
Can I get you a drink or anything else like that?
- No, thank you.
- Make yourself comfortable, 'cuz Mike will be right down, ok?
VF- 51, the Oriskany.
Only better...... and worse.
He was a natural heroic son of a bitch, that man.
So he did do it right.
Yeah, he did it right.
Is that why you fly the way you do?
Trying to prove something?
What I' m about to tell you is classified.
There were... bogeys like fireflies all over the sky.
His F- 4 was hit, he was wounded, but he could have made it back.
He stayed in it...... saved three planes before he bought it.
- How come I never heard that before?
- The battle occurred over the wrong line on some map.
- So you were there?
- I was there.
What' s on your mind?
My options, sir.
Simple.
Or you could quit.
That spin was hell, it would have shook me up.
- So you think I should quit?
- I didn' t say that.
And you have a confidence problem.
I' m not gonna sit here and blow sunshine up your ass, Lieutenant.
A good pilot is compelled to always evaluate what' s happened...... so he can apply what he' s learned.
Up there, we' ve got to push it.
That' s our job.
It' s your option, Lieutenant.
Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, sir, but thank you very much for your time.
No problem.
- Where' s Maverick?.
- I don' t know where he is.
- You know what he' s planning to do?
It' s got to be hard on the guy, though, you know.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mav.
Gentlemen, I hate to break up the party before it really gets out of hand...
Some of you have to depart immediately.
We have a crisis situation.
- Hollywood, Wolfman.
- Maverick.
I' il fly with you.
Gentlemen, this is bull' s eye.
The communication ship SS Layton has become disabled and has wandered into foreign territory.
Your mission is to give air support to that rescue.
There are MiGs in the area, and tensions are high.
If you witness a hostile act, you will return fire.
They can fire that missile from a 100 miles away.
Gentlemen, this is the real thing.
This is what you' ve been trained for.
Make us proud.
Ice...
Hollywood, sector two.
Maverick, you back them up with Merlin on ready five.
Excuse me, sir.
- But with regard to Maverick... is he the best pilot to..?
- I know what' s on your mind, Cazansky, just get on it.
You' ve got a pair of bogeys, 12 o' clock, 15 miles.
They' re doing 500 knots.
Dead ahead, 15 miles, airspeed of 600 knots.
They' re at 15, 000 feet now, dead ahead, 10 miles.
Dead ahead now, eight miles.
- Not yet, I can' t see 'em.
- They must be close.
- Ok, Wood, I' m taking the lead.
Let' s identify 'em.
- Roger, Ice.
- Maverick' s up and ready in alert five.
- Good, good.
My bogey' s still locked up.
He' s drifting to the left.
- Ok, Wood.
Let' s bring it to the right, and we' il get a better angle on 'im.
Now I have four aircraft on radar, not 1 pair, 2 pairs.
Repeat, 4 bogeys.
- Wrong, make that five!
- There' s five, sir.
- That' s five?
- Oh, shit!
- He' s got a radar lock on us.
Get out of there, Hollywood!
Get outta there, goddammit.
We' re coming apart.
I can' t control it!
We' re going down.
Wood' s been hit.
Wood' s been hit!
Voodoo One, Wood' s been hit.
- Launch Maverick on Alert 5.
And launch the rescue helicopter immediately.
- Iceman, what' s your position?
- 090 at 180 miles.
- Three MiGs dead ahead, coming on the left side
I' m bringing it around to the left.
We have four on our tail.
That makes six of them!
We are defensive.
- Launch the alert fiighters!
- Where are they?
- 160 miles and closing in fast, sir.
Ready Willard and Simkin.
- Maverick supersonic.
I' il be there in 30 seconds.
- Where you at, show up here, I' m engaged with 5, repeat 5.
- What about Willard and Simkin?
- We can' t launch any aircraft yet, sir.
- How long?
It' il take 10 minutes.
This thing will be over in two minutes!
Get on it.
One MiG 12 o' clock high...
Watch your back!
- Shit, that was close.
- Come on, kid.
Engage, goddammit!
Maverick, we' ve got a MiG on our tail.
Sir, we just flew right through his jetwash!
- Good recovery, Mav.
- Okay, let' s get in there, we gotta help lce.
Come on!
- No, it' s no good.
Maverick' s disengaging.
Shit!
- Goddammit, Maverick!
- Get in there, Maverick, come on.
What the hell are you doing?
- Talk to me, Goose...
- Ice is in trouble!
Come on, get in there, Maverick!
Ice won' t last down there alone, get in the fight, for God`s sake...
Maverick!
Maverick' s re- engaging, sir.
- I can' t get him off my tail.
I got `im dead ahead.
Firing!
- Where are they?
- 155 miles.
- Two MiGs dead ahead, closer, 800 miles an hour.
- I see them.
Ice is right below us, he' s got a MiG on his tail.
Break left!
He overshot!
Coming in, lce.
I got two MiGs, dead ahead.
One MiG passing between us.
You' ve got a MiG on your left.
He' s gonna fire!
Check the guy to the north!
Get him, lce!
- Okay, you guys, I' m coming in.
- Maverick!
We got a MiG' s coming round on our tail, we gotta get outta here!
- I can' t leave lce.
- He' s still coming around, he' s gonna get behind us!
- I' m not leaving my wingman.
I' m going for it.
Roger, engaged!
- I' m taking the shot.
Fire!
- Bingo!
- Watch it, sucker, yeah!
There' s a MiG to your right.
He' s firing!
- I' m hit.
- I' m shutting it down.
Ice, that bogey' s still behind you.
I' m manoeuvring for a shot.
- Stay with him, Mav, Stay with him!
- Take the shot, nail him, nail him!
- Shit.
Shoot, Maverick!
- Maverick, we' re hit!
- We' re okay.
Ice, on the count of three, break hard right.
Three... two... one... break right!
Firing!
- Damn it, I missed.
- Don' t let him go.
I got him.
Here comes the shot.
- Maverick, move.
There' s a MiG on your tail.
- We got a problem here, we' ve only got one missile left.
- Approaching, 110 miles, sir.
- Goddammit.
I got him, I got him.
He' s right on us, he' s on our tail.
We haven' t lost him, he' s still with us.
- What' re you doing, you' re slowing down!
- I' m bringing him in closer, Merlin.
- You gonna do what?!
- I' m gonna hit the brakes, he' il fly right by us.
I' ve got a good lock.
Strike four!
Mustang, this is Voodoo Three.
Remaining MiGs are bugging out.
- Mustang, this is Maverick, requesting fly- by.
- Negative, Ghostrider.
The pattern is full.
Excuse me, is there something I should know about?
Goddamn that guy.
You are still dangerous.
But you can be my wingman anytime.
Bullshit.
You can be mine.
You' re on the front pages of all the English- speaking world.
- Even though the other side denies the incident, congratulations.
Anything, anywhere.
Where do you think you want to go?
I thought of being an instructor, sir.
Top Gun?!
Yes, sir.
God help us!
Hello, Pete Mitchell.
I heard the best of the best were gonna be back here, so...
This could be complicated.
You know, on the first one, I crashed and burned.
And the second?
But uh...... it' s looking good so far.
- When do I get it back?
Man, give me $50!
It' s all I got.
This is part of a $50 bill like Billy' s with the hidden barcode.
The corner tore.
Happens all the time.
No, the barcode' s going up, so it comes off this corner.
lf it comes off this corner it should have ink on it.
It' s too big to be blank.
Look!
It' s Oki- Doki!
Don' t let your brother get away.
I got to load my camera.
Oki- Doki!
Nice little kid.
How you doing?
- Oki, do the Oki Shuffle.
It' s like this.
Listen, I changed the steps.
You got a problem with that?
You' re supposed to be nice, no matter what!
You little motherfucker...
Grandma!
Grandma!
Oki- Doki pushed me!
You take it already.
Come on, Sheldon.
You playing or what?
Who ate garlic?
When' s lunch?
I want a pastrami on rye.
See that move, Rufus Rabbit?
- What?
Coffee.
Would you like some coffee?
- Say hi to lrene.
Follow me.
I wouldn' t mind giving her a massage.
When DeWald took over he stuck me down here on what he calls park safety watch.
- ls this the tunnel system?
Do any of these tunnels lead to somewhere only DeWald' s boys can go?
No.
All park accesses are unrestricted to park personnel.
Except for the Happy Forest.
That' s being redone.
Show me the Happy Forest.
That would be right here at the end of corridor B.
- How long' s it been closed?
I' m talking about the Happy Forest ride?
The Forest.
Yes, about a couple of weeks.
It wasn' t very popular so they' re trying some new ideas.
I think they found one.
- Thanks.
There you go.
You know... when this thing is over...
Would you like to get together and have some dinner or something?
- Can you put that in here?
Sure.
- A date.
All right.
Can you help me with this?
There you go.
Remember, an elephant never forgets.
All right.
- Louis, how goes it?
- Say hello to lrene.
See you.
Everything on schedule?
I had to tweak the image a little bit, but it' s under control now.
Foley' s up there.
Get him!
Will the DeWald family please come to Tiny Town?
The DeWald family to Tiny Town.
But, honey, the Happy Forest is closed.
OK, I' il meet you at the main gate at 5: 00.
- You' re sorry?
This is Detective Axel Foley.
I' d like to speak with Agent Fulbright.
Could you patch me into his radio?
It' s an emergency.
Fulbright, Foley.
I found what you' re looking for.
I' m at Wonder World.
Fuck!
Get out here now!
Get me 91 1.
All cars in the vicinity of Wonder World.
Proceed there immediately.
10- 19, 10- 45, and 12- 22 in progress.
Why am I not surprised?
All right, don' t shoot!
I' il put my gun down.
I put my gun on the ground, and I' m unarmed.
Don' t shoot.
This is great.
You caught him.
He broke into a security area.
Relax.
- My operation?
God damn it, Axel, what have you done now?
He went berserk.
He was firing a weapon in the park.
- Fuck you!
There' s someone here from...
Fulbright, Secret Service.
- You' re gonna be glad I stayed.
It' s right here.
And what am I investigating?
Paper, US Mint quality.
That' s what was in that truck.
- What is he raving on about?
- ln Wonder World?
This place is as high- tech as NASA and Nintendo combined.
They got a hidden room under this closed ride.
I was in there.
That' s why they were chasing me.
My men were pursuing Mr Foley because he' s delusionary and potentially dangerous.
This room, delusionary also?
No.
- Maybe we' d better look at it.
Right here.
- 'Fraid so, officer.
'Fraid we' ve been caught red- handed, right, Ellis?
'Fraid so.
Would you like to see them?
First quality.
Make a run, Donald.
We call them Wonder World dollars.
Redeemable for admission, rides, souvenirs.
It' s our big Christmas promotion.
We' re giving it away to elementary schools across the country.
You must be in on this.
You supply equipment, he supplies paper, right?
- What' s this paper?
- They switched it.
I am tired of these accusations, officers.
I want this man arrested for public endangerment.
Could I speak with you a moment?
God damn it, we spent a fucking year with our noses up DeWald' s ass!
We' re this close to locking this up, and you piss all over us!
Our case is blown.
I' d have you doing dead time in Leavenworth for life.
Detective Flint, he' s yours.
Let' s go, Axel.
Make sure he doesn' t get on the plane.
I got a wife, three kids, a mortgage and a pension that won' t cut it.
That job at Wonder World is my retirement plan.
We' re being followed.
It' s the security guards at Wonder World.
They probably want to make sure you get on that plane.
Because of you, my future is in real fucking jeopardy.
DeWald is pissed.
Sanderson won' t think too highly of me.
Hold up!
- That liquor store.
- Oh, shit!
I' il get him.
When I do, I' il kill him!
Axel, I left as soon as I got your call.
Are you OK?
- No.
Why would you think that?
"This is important.
Why would he even send that?
Just this.
Oh, shit.
Fry must have found some sample paper.
- What does that mean?
It used to belong to Uncle Sam.
Now we got evidence.
We can put Sanderson and DeWald' s ass in jail.
I don' t think so.
I figured you' d call Uncle Dave here, so we followed him.
I actually was a real cop once so I know how you assholes think, which is to say, slowly.
Very slowly.
So you were carrying the evidence the whole time, Sherlock?
Here' s the real ending of the story.
Let' s see if you like it.
We heard you were loose.
You had a grudge against the park.
I feared you might try to harm our beloved Uncle Dave, so I raced over here as fast as I could to try and stop you, but alas, it was too late.
Get him all the way in the car.
Take it.
Take it.
You worried about fingerprints?
Forget it.
It' s yours.
Give me your weapon.
Throw that gun in the street!
Close the door and get over there!
Hold on, Uncle Dave.
Damn it!
Don' t you die on me, man.
I got an emergency out here.
It' s a gut shot.
That was Uncle Dave.
- 90 over 40 and dropping.
I got to get his pressure up.
Let' s go, guys.
I need oxygen.
Let' s go.
On three.
One, two, three.
Get an arterial line in him.
Any medical history?
- Down the hall.
This is an all- city alert for a suspect in the Thornton shooting.
Suspect is an African- American male...
- Come on, let' s get out of here.
Did you hear?
- ls there a TV here?
Yes, of course.
According to hospital sources, the prognosis is bleak.
How does a psycho like that live with himself?
Janice, Axel.
Get out of the park.
They' re going to kill whoever knows about Roger Fry' s note.
- lf you do anything...
I want you at Wonder World within the hour.
- Then you let us go?
lf you don' t show up here in a half- hour, alone, unarmed and with no cops, I kill your friend.
And it wouldn' t be the first time, would it?
All right, don' t shoot.
I' m putting it on the ground.
I' m not armed.
That was an amateur video shot earlier today by a tourist.
- Thank you.
- Ackwell...
Serge, I need a weapon.
I don' t have any weapon.
- This is the floor model.
People been breathing on it, coughing on it...
Serge, I need a weapon now.
Donny.
Donny, Ackwell in some kind of rush, OK?
So take the Annihilator and wash it off with some cologne, and take the case and make sure it' s nice and pretty.
It' s Corinthian leather.
- Axel, listen.
Am I your friend?
- I' m going to Wonder World.
Wait for me!
Axel!
Put your arms out and hold for a pat- down.
Foley just arrived, sir.
Take him to control.
We have Foley.
- All of it.
- Let' s have the paper.
There' s a Porsche by the front gate.
There' s a phone inside.
- Then we got a stalemate.
Not quite.
Orrin...
We kill you both.
The paper don' t mean jack shit.
- He' s bluffing.
Call me.
Orrin, I know how cops think.
The note is in the car.
The keys, Foley.
Give me the fucking keys.
- Again?
Drop it!
Axel, what are you doing here?
- It' s the coolant safety system.
- We can' t.
He' s trying to use an outside line.
Do something!
Hello, police?
Shit!
Foley' s loose in the park!
Foley' s loose in the park!
Get him!
Mr DeWald!
We gotta do something.
Call for help!
There' s just the modem line for the computers.
I got it!
The phone would just ring and ring.
That' s it.
What good would that be?
A lot of good.
We can call Flint' s pager.
Repeat, Foley is in Hometown Square.
Foley is heading for Alien Attack.
Attention.
This is a red alert.
Aliens are invading the city.
Board the subway trains for immediate evacuation.
He ran up those stairs.
I need that right away!
Damn it.
Not again.
Excuse me.
Dispatch, this is Flint.
Trace that number that keeps calling me.
555- 4085.
It' s a computer line at the Wonder World theme park.
Call and tell them their computer' s broken.
We tried, but all the voice lines are down.
Must be that Uncle Dave shooting.
- Jesus!
- Some fool named Axel Foley.
Where the fuck is he?
Get to a phone and call the police.
I' il try and find Axel.
All right!
There you are.
Foley' s...
I' m the sheriff of this town.
What the hell happened here?
Shit!
Damn it!
Turn that fucking song off!
Foley?
You all right?
- You hurt bad?
You were right.
I got Sanderson handcuffed in the car.
He was in on it, right?
I found out about another partner that was in on it.
So long, Foley.
You OK?
Any chance you can explain any of this to me?
Like why the fuck am I shot?
You guys OK?
- I' m fine.
I wonder what time the park opens.
He needs medical attention.
- Don' t touch it.
I am so happy to introduce to you our new character in Wonder World, named after a man who' s most responsible for my being here today.
Axel Fox!
I don' t think you' ve seen the Tunnel of Love ride, have you?
I didn' t know y' all had a Tunnel of Love ride in Wonder World.
There will be shortly.
ENGLlSH
My name is Ash, and I am a slave.
- Aah!
Close as I can figure it, the year is 1300 A. D., and I' m being dragged to my death.
It wasn' t always like this.
I had a real life once.
A job.
Ash to price check four.
Um, hardware, aisle 12.
Shop S- mart.
I had a wonderful girlfriend, Linda.
Together, we drove to a small cabin in the mountains.
It seems an archaeologist had come to this remote place... to translate and study his latest find,
"Necronomicon Ex Mortis,"
"The Book of the Dead."
Bound in human flesh and inked in blood, this ancient Sumerian text contained bizarre burial rites, funerary incantations and demon resurrection passages.
It was never meant for the world of the living.
It took Linda.
It got into my hand and it went bad.
So I lopped it off at the wrist.
- Big time.
How do you stop it?
- Surround the stranger!
All right, you men, fall in!
All o 'ya, keep a pace!
Stand fast, hellhound!
No, no.
- and, uh, uh, I' m not looking for any trouble.
What a piece of armor this is!
Come on, all you men.
Back on your horses.
Come on!
He who' s prophesied to fall from the heavens... and deliver us from the terrors of the Deadites.
What, that buffoon?
Likely... he' s one of Henry' s men!
I say to the pit with him!
- You miserable bast --
- Get him!
- Get off of me!
Ah, you' re gonna have a little bit of wee fun, mate.
Pick up your feet!
Come on, now.
Come on, pick it up.
Have a taste of this!
You men got something to look forward to... when you get back to the castle.
Lord Arthur approaches!
Raise the portcullis!
Lord Arthur!
Lord Arthur approaches!
That' s lovely, isn' t it?
Move it in.
- Get on!
Move it up, boys.
God save the king!
God save the king.
We love him!
He' s back!
Lord Arthur, where is my brother?
Aye, and fought valiantly.
But last night he fell in battle to Duke Henry' s men.
I' m sorry, Sheila.
Come on.
You barbarian!
A black murderer!
You, sir, are not one of my vassals.
Who are you?
Who wants to know?
I am Henry the Red,
Duke of Shael, Lord of the Northlands and leader of its peoples.
Well, hello, Mr. Fancy Pants.
I got news for you, pal.
Shut your bleedin 'hole!
Shut your bleedin 'hole!
Gentlemen, Lord Arthur!
There is an evil awakened in this land, and while my people fight for their very souls against it, you, Henry the Red, wage war on us!
Charlatan!
It was you who first turned your swords on us!
And this evil has befouled my people as well!
Right, you' re no better.
May God have mercy upon your souls.
What hell- spawned thing lurks there?
No, no!
He' s escaping!
- Hold to!
- Hold him!
- Who' s next?
- It' s him.
Aye, he trembles!
They don' t look so clever now, do they?
He' s frightened white!
Wait a minute.
W- Wait a minute.
- Get him in there!
He' s begging!
- Henry!
We never met.
Tell him.
I do not think he' il listen, lad.
Look.
Uh, wh- whoa.
Spikes.
He says, "Spikes."
Strange one!
Who wants some?
Who' s next, huh?
How 'bout it?
Who wants some, huh?
Who wants to have a little?
You.
You want some more?
Huh?
You want a little?
Do ya?
Do ya?
Huh?
Huh?
Now get on those horses and get outta here.
Let 'em go!
- Halt!
For that arrogance, I shall see you dead.
Yeah.
See this?
- This is my boom stick!
It' s a 12- gauge, double- barreled Remington.
S- mart' s top of the line.
You can find this in the sporting goods department.
That' s right.
This sweet baby was made in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
Retails for about $109. 95.
It' s got a walnut stock, cobalt blue steel and a hair trigger.
Shop S- mart.
You got that?
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Now I swear, the next one of you primates... even touches me --
Now, let' s talk about how I get back home.
I prithee to forgive me, m' lord.
I believed thee one of Henry' s men.
First you wanna kill me, now you wanna kiss me.
Blow.
So what' s the deal?
Can you send me back or not?
Only the Necronomicon has the power.
An unholy book which we also require.
Within its pages are passages that can send you back to your time.
Only you, The Promised One, can quest for it.
I don' t want your book.
I don' t want your bullshit.
Just send me back to my own time.
- You shall die!
Oh!
- It' s a trick.
Get an axe.
Yo, she- bitch.
Ya- hoo!
If the Necronomicon fell into the hands of the Deadites, all mankind will be consumed by this evil.
That one.
Hee- ya!
Groovy.
What' s the matter?
You raised in a barn?
Shut the door.
Probably was raised in a barn with all the other primitives.
The wise men say that thou art The Promised One.
'Tis said that thou wilt journey for the book to help us, and that thou wilt lead our people against the evil.
The only reason I' m going to get the book is to get home.
I believe that thou wilt be leaving in the morning.
Don' t touch that, please.
Your primitive intellect... wouldn' t understand alloys and compositions... and things with molecular structures in the --
What are you doin 'here anyway?
Good, I could use a horse blanket.
Come on, boy!
Whoa.
What?
What is it?
A cemetery.
There, the Necronomicon awaits.
When thou retrievest the book from its cradle, you must recite the words,
Well, repeat them.
- Again!
I got it, I got it!
If I get that book, you send me back.
After that, I' m history.
Come on!
Come on, you!
Come on.
Ooh!
- Get away!
- Oh!
Ooh, no!
Oh, my!
- Lift up!
- Ooh, aah!
Is he up?
Hey, he' s gettin 'up.
Wait a minute.
Oh, God!
- And go!
- Open wide.
How about some hot chocolate, huh?
How' d you like the ta --
Aah, uh, ugh, oh!
Oh!
Bleh.
Where are you takin 'me?
What are you?
Are you me?
I' m bad Ash, and you' re good Ash.
Aah!
Good, bad.
I' m the guy with the gun.
That' il teach you.
Yeah, that' il teach you.
You shall never retrieve the Necronomicon!
You' il die in the graveyard before you get it!
- What' s that you got on your face?
I' il come back for you!
Three books?
Hold it.
Nobody said anything about three books.
L- Like what am I supposed to do?
Well.
Wrong book.
Aah!
Ooh!
Ooh, you!
I' il get back to you.
Well...
Well... seems fairly obvious.
Ooh, wait a minute.
The words.
All right, all right, all right.
Say the words.
Klaatu... barada...
necktie.
Noodle.
It' s an "N" word.
It' s definitely an "N" word.
It' s definitely an "N" word.
Okay, then.
Hey.
Wait a minute.
Everything' s cool.
No, wait!
To the parapet!
Something' s wrong.
Something' s amiss.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
I' m through being their garbage boy.
I did my part.
Now I want back, like in the deal.
The Promised One!
Raise the portcullis!
We' re saved!
- Truly he is The Promised One!
- He' s brought the Necronomicon!
- How are ya?
- He' s brought the book!
- Good boy!
The Necronomicon, quickly.
Did you bring the Necronomicon?
- Yeah, it' s, it' s just that -- - Just what?
Like in the deal.
When you removed the Necronomicon from the cradle, did you speak the words?
- Yeah, basically.
- Did you speak the exact words?
Look, maybe I didn' t say every single, little tiny syilable,
- no, but basically I said 'em, yeah.
Thou hast doomed us all!
When thou misspoke the words, the army of the dead awoke!
Now, whoa, whoa, right there, spinach chin.
You said you could clean this mess up once you got that book.
You said there was a passage that could get rid of this thing and send me back.
It' s true, the book still possesses the power to send you back, but to us it is useless!
The evil has a terrible hunger for the Necronomicon, and it will come here to get it.
You wanted the damn book, I got it for ya.
Very well.
As we are men of our word, we shall honor our bargain.
The wise men shall return you to your own time.
Yeah?
- I thought he was the one.
- Yeah, right.
'Cause that was the deal.
So when do you think we can... start with all the thing and the --
He' s nothin 'but a traitor, he is!
Agh!
The wise men were fools to trust in you.
We put our trust in him.
I still believe that thou wilt help us.
Oh, Sheila, don' t you get it?
It' s over.
I didn' t have what it took.
So long.
But what of the things that we' ve shared?
What of all the sweet words that you spoke in private?
That' s all.
It was more than that.
I still have faith in thee.
I still believe that thou wilt stay and save us.
Coward!
Ash!
Sheila!
- Shoot the bloody thing!
- Hold your arms!
You' il hit the girl!
Uh, me sword!
Damn you!
I shall command every worm- infested son- of- a- bitch...
- that ever died in battle!
- Thank you, sir!
- You there, handsomely now.
- Aye, my liege.
We shall storm their castle and get my book!
Hoist, you damnable varlets!
Welcome back to the land of the living.
Now pick up a shovel and get digging!
- Bring on the wench!
- Gimme some sugar, baby.
Well.
Now, ain' t you a sweet little thing?
Don' t touch me, you foul thing!
Come on.
That' s it.
We got plans for you, girly- girl.
Move!
- Whoa!
My lord, an army of the dead gather in the wilderness.
- They approach the castle.
But two days' ride.
These winged ones are only the first of them.
Perhaps we should leave as soon as possible.
- We could be safe in the mountains.
- Yes, the mountains.
- We must flee!
- It is written.
- They' il take our souls.
That' s it.
Go ahead and run.
Run home and cry to mama!
I' m through runnin '!
I say we stay here and fight it out.
Are all men from the future loudmouthed braggarts?
Nope.
Just me, baby.
Just me.
How will we fight an army of the dead at our castle walls?
How will you fight that?
More words?
Most of our people have already fled.
We are but 60 men.
Now... who' s with me?
I' il stand by ya.
- Me sword' s by his side.
- I' m with you!
- I' il bend my bow to your will, sir.
Hail!
Hail!
Well, my dear, say hello to the boys.
I may be bad, but I feel... good.
- Who rules?
- To you, my lord.
You, sir.
To the castle.
Heave- ho.
Ha!
Hoo!
They' re coming!
The Deadites approach!
There' s so damn many of 'em.
Just maybe my boys can stop 'em from gettin' the book.
Yeah.
And maybe I' m a Chinese jet pilot.
All right, get those rocks up, mister, on the double!
Ready the catapults!
By God, let' s give 'em what for.
- Company, halt!
- Company, halt!
I' il rip his balls off.
Bring forth the scout!
Whoa.
My lord, we are positioned on both fronts.
Fine, fine, fine.
There, my lord, beyond the wall.
The parapet.
That would be the most likely place.
Right.
Arrows.
Torch boy!
Steady.
Oh!
Ram the gate!
Catapults.
Yeah!
- Seek cover!
- Watch out!
- Make way!
Oh!
Oh, you miserable bags of bones!
Sally for --
Sally forth.
Come on, you miserable wretches.
Lower.
Forward!
Hold fast!
Ooh, that' s gotta hurt.
Fire!
Put your... backbones into it.
Protect the book.
God save us all.
Say hello to the 21st century.
I got plenty for everybody!
- Whoo!
- Bye- bye.
It' s the one in the cart we want!
Yaaaaah!
Sheila?
- We' ve secured the courtyard, my lord.
Hey!
- My lord.
The Red!
Hello!
There ya go.
The book is mine.
I' il cut your gizzard out.
Come to papa.
Get him!
Right.
So you wanna play rough, eh?
Okay.
You' re going down!
- I' m goin 'up.
Excuse me.
You' re pissin 'me off, you ugly son of a bitch!
Tallyho!
- We can' t hold the battlements!
We must protect the book!
I got a bone to pick with you.
Come on.
Slice that gizzard open.
Now you' re mine.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
At last, the book.
I possess the Necronomicon.
Now I' il have my vengeance.
Huh?
- Retreat!
Retreat!
- Oh.
- Tricky ones, they are.
If it' s a fight you want --
Watch 'em, lads.
Move yourself, lad!
- Your hand, man.
- Hey, Henry.
- My lady.
- Arthur.
- Well won, my friend.
- We' ve won the day.
- Yeah!
We' re brothers and a new kingdom shall be born!
The book tells us that once you drink this liquid... and recite the words, "Klaatu barada nikto," thou shalt awaken in thine own time.
Hyah!
I thought about staying.
They offered me the chance to lead them, to teach them, to -- to be king.
- But my place is here.
- So I swallowed the juice, said the words and here I am.
- Did you say... the words right this time?
Well, maybe I didn' t say every single, tiny little syilable, no, but basically I said 'em, yeah.
Basically.
You know that story about how you could' ve been king?
I, uh, I think it' s kind of cute.
Yeah.
- Die!
Lady, I' m afraid I' m gonna have to ask you to leave the store.
Who the hell are you?
Name' s Ash.
Housewares.
I' il swallow your soul.
Come get some.
Sure, I could' ve stayed in the past.
Could' ve even been king.
But in my own way,
I am king.
Hail to the king, baby.
Aziz.
Aziz, light!
Aziz...
light.
Good.
We start again.
Evil comes... spreading terror and chaos. "
See the snake, Billy?
The ultimate evil.
- Yes, I' ve got your snakes.
I got all the snakes.
When is the snake act supposed to occur?
If this is the five... and this is the one...
every 5, 000 years.
So, I' ve got some time then.
Good boy.
I' il take it to them.
Be safe from evil.
You see here these different peoples, or symbols of people... gathering the four elements of life... water, fire, earth, air... around a fifth one.
A fifth... element.
Forgive me, Lord.
They already know too much.
Father.
How are you?
- Well.
- Of course.
I' m so glad to see you.
It' s the most extraordinary thing.
It' s the greatest find in history.
You must be parched.
Oh, yes, yes.
I' m sorry.
It' s like a battle plan.
And here, a weapon... against evil.
I' m going to be famous.
Then let us toast to your fame.
To fame.
You can' t toast with water.
Billy, in my sack, the grappa.
This I don' t understand.
This could be something... prehistoric.
I don' t know.
But, wait.
Here.
Look, look.
They' re here.
This man... this perfect being.
I know it.
This divine light they talk about.
What is divine light?
Aziz, light!
Thank you.
My Lord.
Father, this is the most unbelievable thing I' ve ever seen.
Don' t you think?
Are you German?
I know he was about to discover everything.
But, no worry.
I was there in time.
Priest... you and those before you... have served us well.
But war is coming.
Stones not safe on Earth anymore.
This... is really amazing.
The fifth element.
Take the stones.
My Lord... if you take the weapon, we' il be defenseless... when evil returns.
In 300 years... when evil returns... so shall we.
Professor.
Don' t move!
I have a gun!
They' re our friends.
Friends?
Father, they' ve killed the Professor!
I' il explain everything.
- You' re with them?
- Look at me.
I am your friend.
- No, Father.
- Billy, look at me!
Please, put... the gun down.
Hurry!
The wall is closing!
Pass your knowledge to the next priest... as it was passed to you.
I will do as you command, but... hurry, you still have time.
Time not important.
Only life... important.
I will fulfill my mission!
You can count on me!
I will pass the knowledge until your return.
Anything yet?
- The analyzers have jammed.
One shows a million degrees, the others minus 5, 000.
Let' s see it.
It' s taking shape.
Send out a probe.
Ladies and gentlemen... the President of the Federated Territories.
On air with General Staedert in 30 seconds.
I saved this seat for you, Father.
President on the line.
We' re in position.
I have to address the Supreme Council.
Just the facts.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis yet.
We' re initiating thermonucleatic imaging.
What you' re saying is, you don' t know what this is.
All we know is, it just keeps getting bigger.
Recommendation?
My philosophy is shoot first and ask questions later.
I don' t like uninvited guests.
All right, then.
Mr. President?
Priest Vito Cornelius, expert of astrophenomenon.
I... have a different theory to offer you, sir.
You have 20 seconds.
Imagine that this... thing is not anything that can be identified... because it prefers not to be.
Wherever there is life... it brings death... because it' s evil.
Absolute evil.
One more reason to shoot first.
Evil begets evil, Mr. President.
Shooting will only make it stronger.
Probe will obtain objective in five seconds.
Growth rate is at 27%.
Your theory is interesting, but we don' t have time to go into it.
Time is of no importance.
Only life is important.
You' re right.
That' s exactly what we' il do.
We' il protect the life of 200 billion of my fellow citizens.
You may fire when ready.
Up- front loading of a 120- ZR missile.
Marker lights on the objective.
Its structure solidified on the surface.
I think it' s anticipating the attack.
That denotes intelligence.
The most... terrible intelligence imaginable.
120' s loaded.
The ship is in combat formation.
Missiles are loaded.
I have a doubt.
I don' t, Mr. President.
What happened?
What happened?
- Did you destroy it?
- I' m about to.
The planet has increased diameter by 200%.
It' s moving toward the ship.
What do we have that' s bigger than 240?
Nothing, sir.
Staedert, do you hear me?
Get out of there.
I don' t want an incident.
Do you hear me?
Get out of there.
Can you hear me, Staedert?
Listen.
That' s an order.
Do you hear me?
Get out of there!
Good God!
Four a day.
I' m tryin '.
To quit is my goal.
I' m up.
All right, I' m up.
Hey, dog brain, Finger here.
Hi, sweetie.
I love you too.
You haven' t called me that since basic training.
I was talking to the cat.
I forgot... you prefer your cat to the real thing.
At least the cat comes back.
Still pining for that two- timing slut?
There' s millions out there.
I just want one.
The perfect one.
It don' t exist, Major.
Yeah, I know.
What?
Picture of you.
- Like shit.
Must be an old picture.
Bring me your hack for a six- month overhaul.
- A. S. A. P.
I don' t need one.
Who sat next to you for 1, 000 missions?
I know how you drive.
Finger, I drive a cab now... not a space fighter.
How many points you got left on your license?
Major, how many points?
At least 50.
You gotta learn to lie better.
See you tonight.
Welcome to Paradise.
It' s Ruby Rhod, and I' il tell you live at five... the winner of the super green Gemini Croquette Contest!
The winner will go with me for two days to Fhloston Paradise.
Tune in to Radio Cosmos.
Don' t watch all day.
It' il rot your brain.
For a perfect world.
- Give me the cash.
- Been here long?
Long enough.
Give me the cash.
Is that a Z- 140?
Alleviated titanium.
Neurocharged assault model.
Good thing for me it' s not loaded.
It' s not loaded?
You have to... push that yellow button to load it.
Take your time.
Want me to --
There you go.
Give me the cash!
That' s a very dangerous gun.
Maybe you better let me hang on to this one for you.
You sure?
No.
Take it.
I don' t need it.
You like it?
God!
Please enter your license.
Yes, just a minute.
Welcome, Mr. Dallas.
Good morning.
Me too.
I had a horrible nightmare.
Propulsion 2- X- 4.
You have five points left on your license.
Yeah, thank you for reminding me.
Have a nice day.
Why not?
You have 48 hours.
That' s the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
- And then?
- Then it will be too late.
All forms of life.
You' re telling me there' s nothing that can stop this.
There is only one thing.
The Mondoshawan have in their possession the weapon to defeat evil.
Four elements... gathered around a fifth... supreme being, the ultimate warrior... created to protect life.
Able to bring life to the farthest reaches of the universe.
But, if... evil stands there...
Then what?
Life to death... forever.
A Mondoshawan spaceship requests permission to enter our territory.
Give it permission to enter with our warmest regards.
Thank you.
Permission to enter granted.
Show time.
We are lost.
Aknot, we are connected to Earth.
Mr. Zorg' s office.
It' s Aknot.
I' m so glad to hear you, Aknot.
The mission is accomplished.
You' il have what you asked for in a few hours.
Good.
I' il meet you at my factory.
The attack was by two unregistered warships.
Close all borders and declare a state of general alert.
We owe them an explanation.
Three hundred years of waiting for nothing.
No.
The Mondoshawan...
I am their contact.
They will come for me.
This is government business.
I' il keep you informed.
The rescue team has reported from the crash site.
Any survivors?
Only one.
You call that a survivor?
More than I need.
Have you identified it?
The computer went off the charts.
Normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groups... which is enough for any species to perpetuate.
This has 200, 000 memo groups.
Sounds like a freak of nature.
Yeah, can' t wait to meet him.
Over here.
Excuse me.
General, I want to show you something.
This is a normal human DNA chain.
You, me, anybody, right?
Watch this.
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are like ours.
There' s simply more of them, with infinite genetic knowledge.
Almost like this being was engineered.
Is there any danger?
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector.
The cell is, for lack of a better word... perfect.
Go ahead.
Otherwise, I turn him into cat food.
Activate it.
Tissue processing.
Ten seconds to ultraviolet protection.
This is the last phase.
That means growing skin.
Wonderful.
Reconstruction complete.
Remove the shield.
I told you.
Perfect.
Thermal bandages.
like to take a few pictures... for the archives.
- I don' t know.
Activate the phonic detector.
Is that thing solid?
- Good.
If you want out... you' il have to develop those communication skills.
General alert.
Perfect.
Two men with me.
The rest in the main ventilation.
This way.
Lady, stay calm.
This is the police.
There' s nowhere else to go.
Slowly turn around and put your hands on the floor.
Do you understand?
She doesn' t.
I think we need a flying unit.
This is the police.
This is the police.
We are processing your identification.
Put your arms up and follow our instructions.
She has no file.
She dove off.
You just had an accident.
Yes, I know I just had an accident, you daffy bastard!
You have one point left on your license.
Look out!
Left!
I can' t believe it.
Any survivors?
Hi.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I understand "boom."
Bada boom.
Big.
Big bada boom.
Big... bada big boom.
Big boom.
Yeah, big bada boom.
Big boom.
Big bada boom.
You' re lucky you' re not dead.
This is a police control.
Please keep your hands on the wheel.
You have an unauthorized passenger in your vehicle.
We are going to arrest her.
Thank you for cooperating.
Sorry, honey.
Looks like this is your ride.
Open the door.
Do what they say.
Sorry.
"Please... help."
You understand?
Can you please open the passenger door?
Please... help.
I can' t.
I repeat... open the passenger door.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Why not?
Thank you for your cooperation.
Help.
Finger' s going to kill me.
Emergency!
Emergency!
One point has been removed.
Yes, I know!
This is so stupid.
Assist in pursuit of yellow cab.
Unit 47, we' re on the way... after we finish lunch.
Two golden menus.
I' m too old, too tired and too hungry to go chasing some hot rod.
Thank you so much.
And I' m definitely too thirsty.
We got lucky.
If they don' t chase you after a mile, they don' t chase you.
Hang on.
I only speak English and bad English!
Run an ID.
I' m all for conversation, but maybe you can just shut up for a minute!
He' s got a scan blocker.
Means he' s a car thief.
Blast him.
I don' t know what you did... but they are pissed off!
We' re safe for a while.
You want to play hard?
Let' s play hard.
If we get to the fog, we' il be okay.
If we make the fog.
How do they expect us to find anything in this shit?
We' re just going to wait here until things quiet down if you don' t mind.
Shit.
You okay?
Priest.
You don' t need a priest, just a doctor.
Vito Cornelius.
What?
Priest.
Yes?
I' m looking for a priest.
Congratulations.
She' s my fare.
She' s looking for Vito Cornelius.
The phone book said he lived here.
Yes, that' s me, but I don' t know who she is.
No file, no ID, nothing.
She' s got a tattoo on this arm.
Tattoo?
Fifth... element.
Finger' s going to kill me.
Wake up!
- Who are you?
I brought the girl, remember?
The redhead.
She just dropped in on me.
Started speaking a bizarre language.
It' s the divine language.
It' s the ancient language... spoken throughout the universe before time was time.
He' s a she.
You noticed that.
Yes.
- It' s a miracle.
- Miracle she' s not dead.
Wake her up.
But gently, because this woman is... mankind' s most precious possession.
She is perfect.
Perfect.
More dignified.
Hey, lady... wake up.
I shouldn' t have done that.
It was wrong to kiss you.
You' re right.
Just thought you might remember me from the cab.
Remember?
"Bada boom?"
"Big bada boom?"
Big bada boom.
Look.
I drive a cab.
Korben Dallas.
You understand?
Here.
Take it.
You can call me when you learn English.
Just kidding.
What is your name?
You.
Korben.
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba- Laminai- Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Good.
All that' s your name?
Do you have... a shorter name?
Short.
Korben Dallas.
Leeloo.
Leeloo.
Korben, Leeloo.
Leeloo, Korben.
You' re sure she' s a Supreme Being?
Absolutely sure.
Old friends.
Yeah, you' re right.
- What' s your name?
Korben Dallas.
Thank you for your help.
You' ve been kind, but now the girl needs to rest.
She' s been on a long trip.
I know.
I was there when she landed.
Wait, wait, Father.
She said something I didn' t understand.
What does "ekto gamat" mean?
"Never without my permission."
That' s what I thought.
I shouldn' t have kissed her.
Oh, no.
I' m so sorry.
I forgot your food.
How about some nice Thai food?
Yeah, yeah, hold on.
Buddy, I' m waiting all day here.
- Where' s the cab?
Car' s running fine.
Fine.
What "fine"?
"Fine" ain' t in your vocabulary.
You can tell your old buddy Finger what happened.
You save the planet?
You dinged the fender again.
That' s it, right?
I was on my way to see you, and a fare fell in my lap.
One of these big fares you can' t resist.
How big?
long legs, great skin.
Perfect.
I see.
And this perfect fare, she got a name?
Leeloo.
What' s she doing?
Learning our history, the last 5, 000 years that she missed.
She' s been asleep for a while.
I know she' s been through a lot, but we don' t have much time.
You' re right.
Chicken.
Good.
Chicken.
I' m really sorry to interrupt you, but... the case... with the stones... where is it?
Stolen?
Who in God' s name would do such a thing?
Excuse me, sir.
The council is worried about the economy heating up.
Is it possible to fire 500, 000?
I thought from a smaller company, like one of the cab companies.
Fire one million.
But 500, 000 --
One million.
Fine, sir.
Sorry to have disturbed you.
It' s for the Supreme...
Sorry.
I didn' t know your size, and I found you this makeup box.
You just put it like that.
Yes, there was a man with a limp... came here a month ago asking about the stones.
Said he was an art dealer.
What was his name?
I' m bad with names.
- They really make her -- - Perfect, I know.
What' d she say?
She says she knows exactly where they are.
My dear Aknot, how about those two planes you borrowed?
Aknot, is that you?
What an ugly face.
It doesn' t suit you.
Take it off.
That' s better.
Never be ashamed of who you are.
Be proud.
So what if the federal government scattered you to the wind.
What doesn' t kill you makes you stronger.
Your time for revenge is at hand.
The ZF- 1.
The handle' s adjustable for easy carrying.
Discreet.
Titanium recharger, 3, 000- round clip, with bursts of 3 to 300.
With the replay button, a Zorg invention, it' s even easier.
One shot... and replay sends every following shot to the same location.
And to finish the job, all the Zorg oldies but goldies.
Rocket launcher.
Very practical.
Net launcher.
The flamethrower.
My favorite.
And for the grand finale... the new Ice Cube System.
Four full crates... delivered right on time.
Did you bring what I asked?
Yes.
Magnificent.
This case is empty.
Empty?
Empty... the opposite of full.
This case is supposed to be full!
Anyone care to explain?
The Guardians gave the stones to someone they could trust.
She' s supposed to contact this person... in a hotel.
And she' s looking for the address.
Easy.
Dot.
It' s Planet Fhloston, in the Angel Constellation.
We' re saved.
I' m screwed.
You asked for a case.
We brought one.
A case with four stones in it!
Not one or two or three, but four!
Four stones!
But what the hell am I supposed to do with an empty case?
We are warriors, not merchants.
But you can still count!
Look at my fingers.
Four stones, four crates.
Zero stones, zero crates!
We' re out of here!
We risked our lives.
I believe a little compensation is in order.
So you are merchants after all.
Leave him one crate for the cause.
I don' t like warriors.
Narrow- minded, no subtlety... and they fight for hopeless causes, honor.
Hasn' t saved a single one.
I' il tell you what I do like: a killer.
A dyed- in- the- wool killer, cold- blooded, clean and methodical.
A real killer picking up the ZF- 1... would' ve asked about the red button on the bottom of the gun.
Bring me the priest.
I got everything we need to know about Fhloston Paradise... and a blueprint of the hotel.
Good work, my son.
Now to find a way there.
It won' t be easy.
There' s a charity ball tomorrow.
There must be a way.
I' il get it.
Weddings?
Not really.
- Who?
Mr. Zorg.
Zorg.
It' s nice to see you again, Father.
I remember you now.
The so- called art dealer.
I' m glad you got your memory back.
Because you' il need it.
Where are the stones?
I don' t know.
If I did, I wouldn' t tell someone like you.
Why?
What' s wrong with me?
I try to serve life.
But you only... want to destroy it.
Let me explain.
Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction and chaos.
Take this empty glass.
Here it is, peaceful... boring.
But if it is... destroyed.
Look at all these little things.
Notice how each is useful.
What a lovely ballet ensues... so full of form and color.
Now think of all those people that created them.
People who can feed their children tonight... so those children can grow up and have children... and so on.
Thus adding to the great chain... of life.
Fruit.
I' m encouraging life.
In reality, you and I are in the same business.
Cheers.
Where' s the robot to pat you on the back?
Or the engineer?
Or their children, maybe?
There, you see how all your so- called power counts for nothing?
How your entire empire of destruction comes... crashing down... all because of one, little... cherry.
You saved my life... and in return, I' il spare yours... for now.
You' re a monster, Zorg.
I know.
Torture who you have to, the President, I don' t care.
Just bring me the stones.
You have one hour.
It' s gobbling up all the satellites in the galaxy.
Why is it eating up all the satellites?
We' re working on it.
The Mondoshawan deplore the incident but accept our apologies.
And the stones?
Did you find them?
They weren' t on board.
What?
The Mondoshawan never fully trusted the human race.
They gave them to someone they do trust.
Her name is Plavalaguna.
She' s a diva.
She' s singing at a charity ball in Fhloston Paradise.
She has the stones.
The Mondoshawans will help.
We must send someone... to get the stones.
Excellent.
No troops.
I want your best man to go undercover.
I have the perfect one.
You' ve got a message.
Not opening it?
Could be important.
Like the last two were important.
First one was from my wife telling me she' s leaving.
The second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving with my wife.
"It never rain everyday."
This is good news, guaranteed.
I bet you lunch.
Come on.
"You are fired."
Oh, I' m sorry.
At least I won lunch.
Good philosophy.
I like.
You got broken fingers?
You can' t punch my number?
Hi, Mom.
Seventeen messages.
Don' t say your machine is broken again.
They last 1, 000 years.
Mr. Kim, you should go.
This' il take a minute.
You don' t feed your cat a croquette, who you love more than me.
I did.
Good fortune for you.
I' il never be a grandmother.
It bring you good luck!
My body' s failing.
Take me on this trip.
What are you talking about?
You want to make me beg?
No, all I want is an explanation.
I lost my job.
Besides that, everything' s peachy.
Thanks for asking.
Now settle down and explain this to me.
You don' t know you won a trip... to Fhloston Paradise for two for ten days?
I suppose you' il just leave me on the lunar surface?
If I' d won a trip, I' d know.
I would' ve been notified.
They' ve been blaring your name out on the radio for an hour.
I' il call you back.
General, how nice to see you in the 5000 block.
Nice apartment.
You' ve settled into a wonderful life.
Heard you lost your job.
You heard that?
Don' t worry.
I' il get another job.
We have one for you.
"Major Dallas... you' ve been selected for a mission."
- What mission?
- To save the world.
"You leave for Fhloston Paradise.
Get four stones from the diva Plavalaguna and bring them back. "
Why me?
I retired six months ago.
Three reasons.
One:
As a member of the Elite Special Forces Unit... you are an expert in the use of all necessary weapons and spacecraft.
Two:
You' re the most highly decorated member of your unit.
The third?
Of all the members of your unit, you' re the only one left alive.
Check your messages?
I' ve had enough good news.
Might be important.
You' re a winner!
You' ve won the Gemini Contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise for two.
Here are your tickets.
Congratulations.
You couldn' t be more discreet?
Old tricks are the best tricks.
Major Iceborg will accompany you as your wife.
I am not going.
Why not?
Excuse me, General.
Who is it?
Who is it?
My wife.
You remarried?
Yes... no.
I just met this girl, but I' m going to marry her.
I love her, but she hates the military.
She can' t have anything to do with it.
If she sees you, she' il kill me.
- Major -- - You gotta hide somewhere.
You' ve gotta help me.
We' d love to, but where can we hide?
We don' t have time for this.
It' s just for one minute.
You have no idea how much you' re helping me.
No idea -- You have no idea.
Major!
- The three of us won' t fit.
- Sure you will.
Major!
Major!
I' m really sorry to resort to this, Mr. Wallace --
Dallas.
We heard about your good luck and need your tickets for Fhloston.
Is this the way priests vacation?
We' re on a mission.
What kind?
We have to save the world, my son.
Yes!
Down there.
Down there.
This is a police control.
This is not an exercise.
Come on, get in.
For one minute, all right?
Just stay here for one minute.
- This is a police control.
- Don' t touch anything.
This is not an exercise.
Can you please spread your legs... and place your hands in the yellow circles.
- What are you doing?
- Saving you so you can save the world.
No name, no number.
Let' s see it.
Negative.
I am a meat Popsicle.
I found him.
Mr. Korben Dallas?
Sir, can you put your hands in the yellow circles, please?
Smoke you!
Wrong answer.
The police control is now terminated.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Have a nice day.
We got the guy.
Wasn' t easy but we bagged him.
- Thanks for the tip.
- Glad to be of help, my friend.
The guy' s been arrested for uranium smuggling.
All I have to do now is go to the airport, take his place... and I' il be in Fhloston in four hours.
Don' t come back without the stones.
We got Korben Dallas.
Perfect.
Akanit, take command.
Go to Fhloston and get the stones.
If Zorg really wants them... he' il have to negotiate.
Revenge is at hand.
Oh, I am so sorry.
I forgot about the autowash.
There' s an autowash in that shower.
I' m so sorry.
Autowash.
Autowash, yes.
Autowash, in the shower.
It' s funny.
I' ve met you twice today.
Both times you' ve ended up in my arms.
It' s my lucky day.
Lucky day.
Did you hear something?
Cornelius.
- I' m so sorry.
- I don' t need your help.
- Want a cup of coffee?
- Yes, please.
Autowash.
Coffee' s not my specialty.
But you must drink a lot of coffee being a priest.
I had no choice.
I' il take the mission.
- Did you get them?
- Yeah.
- "Leeloo Dallas."
- "Multi- pass."
"Korben David Dallas."
Perfect.
I' m too old.
Now David is... in great shape. he' il protect you.
Now, please, go to the Diva, collect the stones and meet me at the temple.
Yes.
Hurry.
The tickets.
- ID, please.
- I' m sorry.
- In here?
Mr. Dallas?
Oh, right.
Okay.
- The mess?
The garbage.
Made it!
I was afraid I wouldn' t make it... so I sent David to pick up my boarding pass.
Thank you.
Bye.
I am Korben Dallas.
Please report infractions immediately to the spaceport.
And this is?
Leeloo Dallas.
Multi- pass.
Multi- pass.
She knows it' s a multi- pass.
We' re newlyweds.
Just met.
Bump into each other, sparks happen -- She knows.
Anyway, we' re in love.
You know what I mean?
- Yeah.
Make that two.
- Where' s Leeloo?
- On the plane with Mr. Dallas.
What!
I didn' t know what to do.
But this is not possible.
This is not possible.
This is all my fault.
I shouldn' t have given it to you.
I know.
- The key to the temple.
- Oh, no.
Prepare for our arrival.
I go to face my destiny.
I don' t want to go to Egypt.
Dallas?
Korben Dallas?
That' s me.
Just a minute, please.
It will just take one more minute.
We' il be right back.
Mr. Dallas... we really need you now.
Ruby Rhod is broadcasting live and needs to interview you.
Multi- pass.
Tell Aknot that plan A flopped.
Go to plan B.
Aliens ahead.
Spread out.
Backup unit, zone 18.
Ruby Rhod is the biggest radio star.
It' s an honor to be on his talk show.
He' s so green.
I' m on vacation and don' t want to be bothered.
I prefer to remain anonymous.
Korben Dallas!
Here he is!
The winner of the Gemini Croquette Contest.
This boy is fuelled like fire, so start melting, ladies...
He' s hot, hot, hot!
The right size, the right build, the right hair, the right on.
Right on.
And he' s got something to say... to those 50 billion pairs of ears out there.
Pop it, D- man.
Unbelievable.
He' s going to set the world on fire.
Right here from five to seven.
You' il know everything there is to know about the D- man.
His dreams... his desires... his most intimates of intimates.
And from what I' m looking at, intimate is his middle name.
So tell me, my man... you nervous in the service?
Not really.
Freeze those knees' cause Korben' s in the place and he' s on the case.
Yesterday' s frog will be tomorrow' s Prince... of Fhloston Paradise!
The hotel of a thousand and one follies and lollies.
All night long All night
Start licking stamps, girls, because he' il have you writing home to Mama.
Here from five to seven, I' il be your voice, your tongue.
On the trail of the sexiest man of the year:
D- man, your man... my man.
End of transmission.
See you tomorrow at five.
How was it?
It was just absolutely green.
Green like what?
Crystal green.
Any kind of green you want... tree green, emerald, pond green.
Korben, sweetheart, what was that?
It was bad!
No fire!
No energy!
It must pop, pop, pop!
So tomorrow, from five to seven... please act like you have more than a two- word vocabulary.
Okay?
Can I talk to you for a second?
I didn' t come here to play Pumba on the radio.
Tomorrow, from five to seven, you' il give yourself a hand.
Green?
Super green.
Korben Dallas?
That' s me.
I only have one Korben Dallas on my list, and he' s checked in.
That' s impossible.
I am Korben Dallas.
Sorry, sir.
Boarding is finished.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
I need to talk to someone!
I don' t believe this!
This is not an exercise.
This is a police control.
I' m sorry.
There' s been a mistake.
To make your flight short... flight attendants are switching on the sleep regulator... which will regulate your sleeping during the flight.
Thank you.
Hi.
- Yes.
Good.
We are not on vacation.
I work for some important people.
If I hadn' t come to get you, you' d be in trouble.
Understand?
Yes.
But you, no trouble.
Me, Fifth Element.
Supreme Being.
Me protect you.
Sleep.
Sweet dreams, Mr. Dallas.
Sleep regulator operative in zone one.
Thank you.
Zone two?
Everything' s ready, Captain.
What?
Assume your individual position.
But I want all positions!
Mr. Rhod --
Ground, copy?
Got it.
Front gear.
Hey, man, give me some heat, man!
We need some heat here!
Get some heat!
Some heat over here, man!
Good shit, man.
Put the heat over here!
Thank you!
Thank you very much!
Give me this.
Give me this.
Take that.
Mr. Rhod!
You can call me Ruby.
Fueled and ready to go.
I' il buy you one.
Taken off already?
What?
The real Dallas took my place.
I don' t understand.
Are you making fun of me?
No, no, no!
I swear!
I never felt this way before with a human.
Really?
I' ve tried everything.
There' s no way to get on the plane.
Ground is clear.
Ready for liftoff?
Confirmed.
Not there.
No, please, not there.
Please, not there.
- Power pressure?
- Primed.
- Protection?
- Confirmed.
Power increase.
Ten seconds.
I am... a little... disappointed.
5...
If there is one thing I do not like... 3... it is to be... 2... disappointed.
1...
Sorry, it will never happen again.
I know.
Liftoff.
- Landing gear secure.
- Checklist for light speed.
We' re finally getting something.
It' s sending radio wavelengths.
What does it want with radio waves?
Maybe it wants to make a call.
Zorg' s office.
I told you I did not want to be disturbed.
You don' t want to be disturbed except if it' s Mr. Shadow... and Mr. Shadow' s on the line.
It' s Shadow again.
Zorg here.
Am I disturbing you?
No, no, I was just --
Where are you?
Not far now.
Good.
Good, good.
How are the stones?
Fine.
Just fine.
I' il have the four stones you asked for any time now... but it wasn' t easy.
My costs have tripled.
Money is of no... importance.
I... want... the stones.
The stones... will be here.
I' il see to it personally.
I will be among you... soon.
We lost it.
We lost the signal.
Damn!
We' ve begun our descent toward Fhloston Paradise.
The local time is 3: 20 p. m.
Auto- temperature is currently 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
We hope you enjoyed your flight and hope to see you again soon.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to paradise.
Excuse me, dear.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.
Parasites in the main ventilation.
Again?
I' il get it.
Have we arrived yet?
Oh, good.
We have twelve swimming pools and two on the rooftop.
All the restaurants are between levels two and ten.
The planet Fhloston has 400 beaches, all accessible until 5 p. m... then the airship goes higher... to offer you a better view.
Is the Diva here?
Not yet.
Any tickets left for the opera?
You have a seat reserved, front row... next to Ruby Rhod!
I love him.
He' s so sexy.
He has your ticket, and he' il be here in 20 minutes.
Where can I get something to wear?
- Thank you.
You miserable bastard, I never should' ve pushed you out.
I was in labor for days, and this is how you repay me?
I should' ve gotten a robot.
Come on, Ma.
I should be there, not you.
I need a cocktail.
Get the case in.
Hello, Ms. Diva.
I' m Fog.
Welcome to the --
Tall.
- Sure.
- What' s your name?
Ms. Plavalaguna is glad that you are here.
She' il give you what you' ve come to get after the concert.
You' re listening to Radio Cosmos.
It is 5 p. m.
Helm to 108.
Helm 108!
Helm to 108.
Time to join Ruby Rhod... and Korben Dallas, the lucky winner... of the Gemini Croquette contest.
Coming at you live from Fhloston...
Paradise!
Ruby Rhod at your service with Korben and the manager of this hotel... and Miss Gemini Croquette in person... and 8, 000 other lucksters here... to enjoy the privilege of the unique concert of Miss Plavalaguna!
Now we enter what must be... the most beautiful concert hall of all the universe!
A perfect replica of an old opera house... but who cares?
To my right, a row of ministers, more sinisters than ministers.
To my left, Baby Ray, star of stage and screen.
He' s stone- deaf!
To who?
And here we have Roy Von Baker, king of laser ball.
The Emperor of Kodar Japhet and his lovely daughter.
"I love to sing," she recently confessed to me.
By the way, I have a recording of her talented voice.
I' il play the rest after the concert.
Now it' s time... for Korben to say the word of the day.
Tell me, my man, you happy here in the big world?
Thrilled.
And now... champagne!
Commercial!
Break for 30 seconds.
Show time.
I have a ship in trouble requesting permission to dock.
Inform security.
- More than I need.
Champagne for the Diva.
I' il take it.
I found it.
Get her!
It was an ambush.
If it' s war they want... it' s war they' il get!
My compliments, little lady.
Thank you for doing the dirty work.
I couldn' t have done a better job myself.
Hand over the stones.
I' m taking over the ship!
Hands up!
I know this music.
Let' s change the beat.
I think we' re being attacked.
They' re everywhere.
I see one of them.
They' re warriors, and they' re ugly.
They got big teeth, and they got big foreheads, and they stink.
Mangalores.
The government sent me to help you.
If somebody hears this, come and get me.
I' m in the first row.
You must give her the stones.
Who?
The Fifth Element.
The Supreme Being sent to Earth to save the universe.
Leeloo?
But she' s more fragile than she seems.
She needs your help... and your love... or... she will die.
Stay with me.
Help!
If you want something done... do it yourself.
You can' t die.
Wake up!
Where are the stones?
Where are the stones?
The stones.
They' re not here.
The stones, where are they?
In me.
What?
Oh, my God, Korben.
Korben, another one coming.
- I think we should go.
One minute.
Hey, you!
- Where' s the other?
I said, "one minute."
Ruby, hold this gun.
What do you want me to do?
Come on.
Put your hand on it.
- What do I do?
- If he moves, squeeze the trigger.
- I don' t feel right.
- The stones are "in me."
I got a headache.
This ain' t me.
Sorry.
Think he' il be okay?
Oh, my God, Korben.
Another one coming.
Shit.
Three coming.
You guard this with your life... or you' il look like him.
Green.
Super green?
Is that your idea of a discreet operation?
Don' t worry.
I know my man.
He' il calm things down.
Move!
Oh, my God.
Ladies and gentlemen... this is amazing.
Let me do it.
Oh, my God.
Korben Dallas, my man, is in trouble.
The gun!
Give me the gun.
I' m going to go... and try to see if I can see something a little closer.
Yes, the gun.
Yeah.
Thanks, Ray.
Don' t shoot!
I' m not armed!
Get up!
You' ve got the wrong guy!
I' m not armed.
Oh, my God.
I' m on vacation.
Don' t shoot me, please.
I won a... contest.
Fhloston Paradise.
Down.
Wait a minute.
Get down!
Down!
Sorry, my man.
Where are you?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
They' re coming.
Don' t move.
What you doing?
Count to ten.
- Was that a bomb?
- Shut up and count!
3!
4!
6... 7, 8...
9...
10.
I am... very disappointed.
Korben, what are you looking for?
Control room.
- This is it.
- I' il be here.
Let' s go.
Quiet!
You in charge?
How many are out there?
- I don' t know.
- Let' s count.
Five on the right.
Two on the left.
Find the leader.
They won' t fight without the leader.
One more shot and we start killing hostages.
That' s the leader.
Send someone to negotiate.
I' ve never negotiated.
You mind if I try?
We' re sending somebody to negotiate.
Anybody else want to negotiate?
Where did he learn to negotiate like that?
I wonder.
Where' s Ruby?
I thought he was dead.
Master!
Just a helping hand.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Ruby Rhod... still alive.
What' s wrong with you?
It hurt!
I realize that you must be pretty mad at me... but I' m fighting for a noble cause.
Yes, you' re trying to save the world.
Right now, I' m trying to save Leeloo.
Leeloo' s in trouble?
When is Leeloo not in trouble?
- The Diva' s suite.
Hang on.
How do you get yourself into these positions?
It' s all right.
Everything' s okay now.
Listen.
I got the stones.
Just take it easy, all right?
My man, my man, what' s this thing with all these numbers?
If it was a bomb... the alarms would go off because all these hotels have bomb detectors.
This is a type "A" alert.
For security reasons, the hotel must be evacuated.
Proceed calmly to the lifeboats...
Stay calm!... located in the main hallways.
Stay calm!
You know how to stop this, right?
Two minutes to complete evacuation.
Get back!
Evacuation!
Sorry, you can' t stay here.
There' s a bomb in the hotel.
I know.
I don' t want to die.
Please, my son.
One minute to total evacuation.
This one.
45 seconds.
Get her strapped in.
You know how to fly this?
Like driving a cab.
How will we get out the door?
15 seconds.
10... 9, 8...
7... 6... 5.
For the honor.
Hold on.
Like driving a cab.
It is now 7 p. m., time for the news.
See you tomorrow for a new adventure.
End of transmission.
That' s the best show I ever did.
Major Dallas has the five elements on board... and the priest is guiding them to the temple.
We' re saved.
The Diva said I should take care of you.
Humans act so strange.
What do you mean?
Everything you created... is used to destroy.
We call it human nature.
You learn that on your screen?
I' m not finished yet.
I' m up to "V."
"V" is good.
Some good words in "V."
Like what?
"Valiant."
"Vulnerable."
"Very beautiful."
Oh, of course, Munro!
Mr. President?
Now what?
We have a problem.
It' s advancing?
It' s not only advancing, it' s moving at incredible speed.
And do you have any idea where it' s heading?
Korben, there' s a general on the phone.
I' il give you the President.
Major Dallas, I first would like to salute a warrior.
You' re a shining example of this army.
In the name of the Federation --
Any idea when you' il get to the point?
That' s the problem.
How much time do we have?
If its speed remains constant, in an hour and 57 minutes.
They just landed in the desert.
Good job, David.
- Where?
Here?
You got it figured out, Father?
This one should be fire.
- Theoretically.
The four stones should go around.
The Fifth Element should be in the middle... and then the weapon against evil should work.
You' ve never seen this work?
Give me that.
I' m sure this has one too.
That' s it.
Match up the symbols.
Go!
Wind.
My man, what you doing?
- What you doing?
Trying to keep you in the D. J. business.
Fire.
Done.
What happens?
So, now, we have to open them.
Right?
Theoretically...
No.
Leeloo, honey, wake up.
You have to help us.
How do you open the stones?
Wind blows.
Fire burns.
Yes, I know all that.
But how do you open these stones?
falls.
What does it mean?
I think that --
Maybe it' s a charade.
A game or something.
- Dead?
Too late.
Three minutes.
I think mine is broken.
Why I gotta get the broke one?
We' re never gonna make it.
It moved.
- Nothing.
Shut up, shut up!
Show me what you did, step- by- step.
- I was standing here.
- Quickly.
I put my hands on the top like this, and I said...
"We' re not going to make it."
And that' s it?
Korben, my man.
Wind.
She said, "Wind blows."
Everyone take a stone.
Earth for Earth.
Go!
Earth.
Open the other one.
Korben, my man, I have no fire.
I have no matches.
Do you have any?
I stopped smoking.
Father, you smoke?
Got some matches?
We need some fire.
We' re going to die.
Don' t breathe.
Fire.
One minute.
Let' s go, Leeloo.
Wake up.
It' s time for you to work now.
Protect life... until death.
Listen to me!
Listen to me.
Listen, I know you' re very tired.
I' il take you on vacation.
But if you don' t do something right now... we' il all die.
What' s the use of saving life when you see what you do with it?
It' il enter the atmosphere in 40 seconds.
You' re right.
There are some things... very nice things worth saving; beautiful things.
Beautiful things.
Like love?
That' s good.
That' s a good example.
I don' t know love.
I don' t know love.
I was built to protect, not love.
So there' s no use for me other than this.
You' re wrong.
You' re wrong.
I need you.
I need you, very much.
Why?
Because... because...
Tell her, Korben.
Why you need me?
Because...
Tell me.
- Because I --
Because I love you.
I love you.
10... 9... 8... 7... 6, 5... 4, 3... 2... 1.
Scanner imaging has confirmed the dark planet dead.
The planet seems to have stopped at 62 miles from impact.
What' s wrong?
What you screaming for?
I' m leaving.
Let me introduce Professor Mactilburgh who runs the center.
It' s an honor, Mr. President.
Where are my two heroes?
They were so tired from their ordeal, we put them in the reactor.
I have 19 meetings after this.
Let me see if they' re revived.
Thank you.
We go live in one minute.
They' re... not ready.
They need... five more minutes.
You have 20 seconds.
No, ma' am, I tried.
No, ma' am.
Who' s that?
Claims to be Korben' s mother.
Give it here.
Mrs. Dallas, this is the President.
On behalf of the Federation --
That doesn' t even sound like him.
You don' t sound like an idiot.
I' il throw myself in traffic.
Police found her in the street.
Looks like she was bitten.
Some kind of an animal.
Jesus!
Her water' s broken!
We' il have to do a C- section!
[Heart monitor beeping]
What you got down there, little man?
I' il bet it is.
Ha ha ha!
So, where are we going?
It' s a surprise, baby.
Yeah.
Oh, my God!
What the fuck are we doing here?
Look at all that.
What the fuck is that?
[Speaking Slavic language]
[Techno music playing]
Wow.
Whoo!
All right.
Yeah.
Whoa!
Man.
Ahh!
No!
No!
Aah!
No!
No!
Aah!
Is that him?
It' s Blade.
It' s the daywalker.
Come on, daywalker!
Hey!
[Click]
Aah!
Aah!
Fuck him up!
We' re gonna jack you up.
Make him hurt bad.
Yaah!
Quinn...
I' m getting a little tired of chopping you up.
Thought I might try fire for a change.
[Speaking Slavic language]
No!
Please don' t!
Put him out.
Yes, sir.
Paramedics.
Got a charred cadaver here for you.
Still warm, too.
1, 2, 3.
Oh, Jesus, that' s rank.
Paramedics said he was still screaming when they found him stapled to a wall.
That' s very pretty.
Did you check the chem count?
KAREN:
You took this off a D. O. A.?
Yeah.
But this doesn' t make any sense.
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is impossible.
They' re binucleated.
OK, Curtis, it' s 3. 00 in the morning --
This is not a joke.
I' ve got the body sitting in the morgue right now.
I thought you promised to give me some distance.
OK.
Show me the body.
Done.
We' ve had that conversation.
You haven' t started on the internal organs yet?
Just a blood sample through the pericardium.
The maxilla looks a little deformed.
There' s some odd muscle structure around the canines.
I' m going to start the "Y" and check the tracheal mucosa.
Let me ask you something.
[Sighs]
Sometimes.
But then I remember how much of an asshole you were.
Want to cut me some slack here?
You asked for some time off, I gave you some time off.
Look, Curtis --
Yaah!
Came back to finish you off.
Freeze!
Motherfucker, are you out of your damn mind?!
Aah!
[Siren]
[Snarling]
Hey, you!
Aah!
My shoulder.
It' s dislocated.
Uhh!
BLADE:
Whistler.
Whistler.
[Turns off machine and radio]
Bringing home strays now?
Should' ve killed her, then.
Yeah, I know.
But I didn' t.
Or I will.
Uhh.
She' s borderline.
Another hour, she' d be well into the change.
listen close.
I' m going to inject you with Allium sativum -- garlic.
This is going to hurt -- a lot.
It was Quinn.
Frost' s little errand boy?
You get a lead on him?
No.
Uhh!
Hold her.
I give her fifty- fifty if she makes it through the night.
Blade... the daywalker -- still pursuing his ridiculous crusade.
How many died?
We don' t have an exact count.
Apparently, he used a lot of silver.
We' re having difficulty --
Send in Frost.
Deacon Frost.
You can come in now.
[Sniffs]
These nightclubs of yours are dangerous.
They draw needless attention to our kind.
Your policy, not mine.
Our livelihood... depends on our ability to blend in and our discretion.
Maybe it' s time we forgot about discretion.
We should be ruling the humans, not running around making back- alley treaties with them.
For fuck' s sake, these people are our food, not our allies.
You' re out of line, Frost.
Am I?
Or maybe I' m just the first to say out loud what we' ve all been thinking.
We have existed this way for thousands of years.
Who are you to challenge our ways?
You' re not even a pureblood.
Like it matters.
I was born a vampire, as was every other member of this house, but you, Frost...
you were merely turned.
The world belongs to us, not the humans.
You know that.
Do we have any other business to discuss?
Well, uh... there' s the matter of our offshore accounts.
We' re having difficulty --
And have you made the transfer to the --
Gitano... you may wake up one day and find yourself extinct.
You' re a week early.
Yeah.
Yeah, I figured that might happen.
You take care, all right?
[Mechanical whirring]
I must be getting soft in my old age,
It was damn stupid of you.
Might' ve lucked out, though.
I checked her background.
It turns out she' s a haematologist.
She might be useful to us.
I doubt it.
I' m serious.
I took a look at that notebook of hers.
She' s onto something.
I had to increase the dose.
It' s over 50 milligrams now.
That' s getting dangerous.
Uhh...
[Groaning]
[Labored breathing]
Wander off the beaten path, Doctor?
Who are you people?
[Lands silently]
So, am I a prisoner here?
We just had to take certain precautions before we let you go.
You got to understand, they' re everywhere.
Vampires -- the Hominus nocturna.
They' re hard to kill.
They tend to regenerate.
And I' m supposed to believe all this?
Well, you already met Mr. Crispy at the hospital.
What do you think?
So, what do you use, then?
Stakes?
Crosses?
Crosses don' t do squat.
Some of the legends are true, though.
Vampires are severely allergic to silver.
Feed them garlic, and they go into anaphylactic shock.
Then, of course, there' s always sunlight, ultraviolet rays.
You want to give it a try tonight?
It' s still heavy.
Well, you' re so big.
If you want to live to see another day, you' il be out of town by nightfall.
So where am I supposed to go?
You' ve been exposed to them.
One way or another, somebody' s going to take you out.
There' s a war going on out there.
[Car engine starts]
Sometimes, people like yourself get caught in the crossfire.
I have blood samples.
I can go to the police.
They own the police.
You have to understand, they' re everywhere.
Chances are you' ve seen them yourself and didn' t know it -- on the subway or in a bar.
So that' s it?
You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
Vampire mace... silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
You keep your eyes open.
Be careful.
One other thing... buy yourself a gun.
If you start getting sensitive to daylight... if you find you' re thirsty regardless of how much you had to drink, then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself.
Better that than the alternative.
You have been warned before.
[Scoffs]
You are wasting your time.
It' s a dead language.
The ancient texts can never be translated.
You wouldn' t even understand them.
Damn it, Frost!
Shh.
Keep your voice down, Gitano.
We' re in a library.
You don' t need to shout.
What are you up to, Frost?
What are you going to do, hmm?
[Sighs]
Hey!
Remember what we told you.
You keep your eyes open.
They' re everywhere.
But it' s daytime!
[Elevator bell dings]
How you doing?
Hi there.
Hey.
I' m sorry.
Whoa.
I' m sorry, OK?
I didn' t mean to scare you.
The front door was open.
What are you doing in here?
I' m just here on a routine check.
Look, I' m -- I' m Officer Krieger, 42nd precinct.
You' re Karen Jenson, right?
Yeah.
Your co- workers at the hospital said that you were kidnapped last night.
Are you OK?
What happened to the other doctor I was with?
Curtis Webb?
Um, he died.
No, look, don' t worry about that right now, OK?
Why?
Because you' re dead, too, you bitch.
Aah!
What is it?
[Sniffs]
[Laughs]
Yeah.
He said it would work against vampires.
Vampires?
Who said I was a vampire, huh?
Nobody.
He' s a familiar -- a vampire wannabe.
If he' s loyal enough and he proves himself, maybe his master will turn him.
Wait a minute.
You used me as bait?
Is all that necessary?
That' s a glyph -- a vampire cattle brand.
It means that Officer Krieger is somebody' s property.
Another vampire tries to bleed this little hooker, then they have to answer to his owner.
Deacon Frost.
We' ve been tracking him for a long time.
All right.
Officer Krieger, you going to be a good little bloodhound, huh?
Tell us what your master' s been up to.
Oh, great, now you' re robbing him.
You going to rob me, too?
How do you think that we fund this organization, huh?
We' re not exactly the March of Dimes.
It' s fake.
Well...
Looks like our friend here has been blood running, huh?
Hillbarn Clinic.
I know this place.
It' s a blood bank.
Owned by vampires, and there' s one in every city.
And they always deliver.
So, where were you taking it?
Ooh!
Look, take it easy.
Where were you taking it?
Go fuck yourself.
No, you fuck this.
[People screaming]
You better wake up.
The world you live in is just a sugarcoated topping.
There is another world beneath it -- the real world.
And if you want to survive it, you better learn to pull the trigger.
Wait a minute.
I' m coming with you.
You' re useless.
I have to stick with you.
It' s the only way that I' il stay alive long enough to find a cure for myself.
There is no cure.
He' s not going to come back.
Nobody' s that stupid.
When you understand the nature of a thing, you know what it' s capable of.
It' s Krieger.
DlSPATCH:
Yes?
KRlEGER:
I got a delivery in progress here, and I just had a run- in with Blade.
BLADE:
That' s a vampire mark.
It means that there' s a safe house around here somewhere -- a place they can go with donors coming.
See the valets over there?
They' re vampires.
So is the doorman and the whore on the corner.
How can you tell?
By the way they move... the way they smell.
It' s like a bad dream.
There are worse things out tonight than vampires.
Like what?
Like me.
OK, Vampire Anatomy 101.
Crosses and holy water don' t do dick, so forget what you' ve seen in the movies.
You use a stake, silver, or sunlight.
You know how to use one of these?
Nope... but I' il damn sure learn quick.
The safety' s off, rounds already chambered -- silver hollow point filled with garlic.
You aim for the head or the heart.
Do you have an invitation?
[Dance music playing]
Kenji!
Ohh!
I can' t tell you that, man.
Uhh!
I' m going to ask you one more time.
Where' s the entrance?
OK.
It' s in the freezer.
I told you!
It' s in the fridge!
You give Frost a message from me.
Some kind of archive.
This must be where they keep most of their records.
Isn' t this just a little high- tech?
They' ve got their claws into everything -- politics, finance, real estate.
They already own half of downtown.
Frost throws a good party.
Yeah... but where is he?
Come on, baby.
Don' t keep everyone waiting.
Deacon, there' s someone here to see you.
I got to talk to you, Frost.
I' m sorry.
I had to come here.
I know that.
Dumb fucking me.
I know you' re disappointed.
Am I that transparent?
You want to meet him?
Yeah.
I can get you guys in with him, because we' re tight.
We' re like brothers.
Fuck.
Aw, fuck.
Frost.
Deac.
Deac.
I' ve been telling these bitches all about you, man.
They' ve been dying to meet you.
Bad ass bitches.
They --
Hi.
Deac?
Frost, it' s about Blade.
Because, like, when he' s focused on business...
Look, Frost, this is important.
WOMAN:
And you were stupid enough to take it.
Shut up, bitch.
I didn' t know he was going to be there.
It was a trap, see?
But don' t worry about it.
It' s no problem.
We can still get the girl.
Yeah!
Forget the girl.
WOMAN:
I know you do.
You hear me, Quinn?
What?
Wait a minute, man.
[Laughs]
What' s that smell?
HlGH- PlTCHED VOlCE:... image carefully, Frost.
You will need 12 purebloods to make the ritual work.
Krieger, is that you?
He -- he' s here!
He' s here!
This must be Pearl, the record keeper.
He' s going to kill me!
You need me, Frost!
You need me!
Pearl, you' re history.
PEARL:
Frost.
Ruthless bloodsucker.
Congratulations, Blade.
Frost.
I hear you' ve been looking for me.
I' m flattered.
It' il pass.
Fuck.
[Snap]
That, biscuit boy, is a U. V. lamp.
We' re gonna play a little game of 20 questions.
Depending on how you answer, you may walk out of here with a tan.
What' s that?
Oh, that?
Oh, it' s nothing.
It' s routine research.
Heh heh.
Actually, it' s a video game.
[Shrill screaming]
What prophecy?
There are so many out --
[Screaming]
Is that so?
Then you won' t mind me borrowing this for a while, will you?
If he moves, fry him.
What' s in here?
Nothing.
It' s a -- a storeroom.
But you' re wasting your time.
There' s nothing of importance to anyone.
Then you won' t mind if I take a peek.
No!
[Screaming]
[Sizzling]
[Whimpering]
These are the pages from The Book of Erebus, the Vampire Bible.
It contains everything... their entire history.
La Magra must be one of their legends.
Shh!
Do you remember me?
Hey!
Heh.
Remember?
I got a new one.
[Laughs]
Think I' il ever play piano again?
[All laugh]
You can slice him, you can dice him, but the Quinn man just keeps on coming!
Check it out.
I' ve got his pigsticker.
You' re a fuck up, Crease!
You' re a fuck up!
Ohh.
You' re just full of surprises, isn' t you, chief?
Stay with me, sweetness...
Silver.
Nice craftsmanship, huh?
Probably cost you a pretty penny.
Now, this here is a man who takes his job... just a little too seriously, don' t you think?
Come to think of it, Blade,
I owe you one.
Actually, if you want to get technical, Blade...
[Laughing]
Oh, what' s so funny, bright eyes?
[Muffled radio transmission]
No!
No guns!
No!
No!
No!
No!
I need him!
He wants Blade alive!
KAREN:
You' ve been listening in the whole time?
Keeping radio contact.
Think I' d let him run loose without a chaperon?
Christ!
I' m too old for this.
Somebody get me a god- damn wheelchair.
[Screaming]
Whistler!
He can take care of himself.
[Horn blows]
Aah!
QUlNN:
Aah!
What are you gonna do?
What' s wrong?
Let me give you --
No!
Get away.
[Injects needle]
You' re one of them, aren' t you?
I' m something else.
I found him when he was 13.
He' d been living on the streets, feeding off the homeless.
His need for blood had taken over at puberty.
I took him for a vampire at first.
Almost killed him, too.
Then I realized what he was.
Blade' s mother was attacked by a vampire while she was pregnant.
She died, but he lived.
Unfortunately, he' d undergone certain genetic changes.
He can withstand garlic, silver, even sunlight, and he' s got their strength.
This time tomorrow, all those wounds of his will be healed.
He still ages like a human, though.
See, vampires age slower than us.
Unfortunately... he also inherited their thirst.
I thought the serum was supposed to suppress that.
Time' s running out.
His body' s starting to reject it.
So far, all my efforts to find a cure have failed.
Why do you hunt them?
I had a family once -- wife and two daughters.
Then a drifter came calling one evening, a vampire.
He toyed with 'em first, tried to make me decide which order they' d die in.
We kill as many of 'em as we can find, but it' s getting worse.
Because of Frost.
There' s something happening in the vampire ranks.
KAREN:
Blade.
Whistler told me what happened.
He told me what you are.
You don' t know me.
You don' t know anything about me.
I' m not human.
You look human to me --
Humans don' t drink blood.
That was a long time ago.
I have spent my whole life
looking for that thing that killed my mother.
It made me what I am.
And every time I take one of those monsters out,
I get a little piece of that life back, so don' t you tell me about forgetting.
... my fault he took us by surprise!
Two of them against your entire security force?
Don' t put that shit on me, OK, 'cause you were there, too!
Aah!
You little skeez!
Don' t see the lifestyle really suits you.
I should put this stump through that shit- eating grin of yours.
Face it, angel.
You were sloppy.
QUlNN:
Deac, let me take this guy out, man.
Look.
Look what he fucking did!
He took my hand again!
Listen to me.
I want him alive.
What the fuck are you talk -- you want him alive?
We' ve been trying to kill this motherfucker for years.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Big guy, relax.
Be patient.
I need you, man.
Yeah.
[Muffled grunting]
How you feeling?
Look at that.
Whew.
Getting a little toasty out here, huh?
When was the last time you stopped to appreciate a good sunrise?
Oh, that' s right.
You were born a vampire, so you never had the pleasure, have you?
That' s OK.
It' s all right.
Least we' re here together.
[Groans]
'Cause actually, you know, when you get to know me,
Bit of an innocent, you might say.
[Gasps]
Do what you want, Frost.
Doesn' t make any difference.
You just don' t fucking get it.
You' re never gonna be a pureblood.
Hold him.
Aah!
Jesus Christ.
Have a nice day.
Sorry, you old dog.
You just got a little too long in the tooth.
[Quinn laughs]
What, man?
"Long, tooth."
Did I tell you the one about...
[Screaming]
What have you done with Dragonetti?
Tkktkk.
Whistler.
[Sniffs]
Smells like a vampire wiped his ass with it.
I took it from the archives.
It' s written in blood.
It' s from The Book of Erebus.
I think it' s what Frost has been working on.
It' s something about the Blood God, the spirits of the 12.
I -- I don' t know.
I can' t make out the rest of it.
Maybe this' il help.
I' il figure out something.
So what' s all this?
Took a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
For your miracle cure?
This is E. D. T. A.
It' s an anticoagulant.
We use it to treat blood clots.
Now look what happens when I introduce it onto a sample of vampire blood.
Take a step back.
The reaction' s energetic.
Some cure.
I didn' t say E. D. T. A. was a cure.
But maybe you could use it to explode some vampire heads.
Wait a minute.
I need a sample of your blood.
Later.
Gotta go downtown.
Need some serum.
Serum can wait.
This is important.
[Coughing]
Is he sick?
Cancer.
You have a lot of love for him, don' t you?
He makes the weapons.
You know, my mother used to say,
[Footstep]
You don' t look so good.
I' m just a little tired.
You know we' ve been... working all night.
I guess we didn' t catch it in time.
You got another day, two at the most.
For what it' s worth, I' m sorry.
You make it sound like I' m already dead.
Blade.
How you doing, chief?
Easy.
Wouldn' t want our little friend here to wind up on the back of a milk carton, now would we?
Ah, it' s nice to finally meet you, man.
Had my eye on you for years.
I know all about you -- your serum, Whistler -- everything.
Sunblock.
Hey, it' s a start, right?
The goal, of course, is to be like you, the daywalker.
You got the best of both worlds, don' t you?
All our strengths... none of our weaknesses.
Well, maybe I don' t see it that way.
Oh, so it' s back to pretending we' re human again?
Spare me the Uncle Tom routine, OK?
You can' t keep denying what you are, man.
You think the humans will ever accept a half- breed like you?
They can' t.
They' re afraid of you.
And they should be.
You' re an animal.
You' re a fucking maniac.
Look at 'em.
They' re cattle, pieces of meat.
What difference does it make how their world ends?
Plague... war... famine.
Morality doesn' t even enter into it.
We' re just a function of natural selection, man, the new race.
Looks like your mascara' s running.
I' m offering you a truce.
I want you with us.
What do you think, I' m stupid?
You' re familiar with the Blood God.
You' re an idiot.
You know that?
I came down here offering you an easy way out, and you spit it right back in my fucking face.
Careful.
What do I care?
They' re nothing but cattle... just like you said.
aah!
Go home.
It was simple.
Why do vampires need to drink blood?
Right.
So it' s a genetic defect, just like haemolytic anaemia.
That means that we have to treat it with gene therapy, rewrite the victim' s DNA with a retro virus.
They' ve been using it on sickle cell anaemia.
Are you sure that' s safe?
I have no idea, but I don' t have a choice, do I?
You actually think this could work?
On me... yes.
On Blade, I' m not so sure.
See, he didn' t contract vampirism from a bite like I did.
He was born with it.
It' s -- it' s part of his DNA.
I' m sure I can cure his thirst, but it' s gonna take time.
Ah, we' re out of time.
You saw what was on that disc.
Damn.
Get out of here.
[Chuckle]
[Laughter]
Nice place.
Took us a while to find it!
I ain' t gonna bite you.
Do your thing.
Whistler.
Frost took her.
Listen to me.
The disc.
He decoded it.
Frost is trying to... trigger a fucking vampire apocalypse.
There' s some kind of...
Vampire God he' s trying to resurrect.
La Magra.
You' re the key.
He needs your blood.
The blood of the daywalker.
You' re the chosen one.
Listen to me, Blade.
You can' t go after him.
Bullshit.
If Frost gets his hands on you, it' s all over.
There' il be armies of the motherfuckers.
[Groan]
You' re gonna have to finish me off.
Don' t want me coming back.
We can treat the wounds.
It' s too far gone.
You know that.
Give me your gun.
No.
Give me the god- damn gun.
Now walk away, you stupid son of a bitch.
Walk the fuck away.
By the time you watch this, your friend Whistler should be dead.
If it makes any difference to you, he put up quite a fight.
You can find us at the Edgewood Towers.
You seem a bit... tense.
like you need to release something.
You know?
Blade not... giving it to you maybe.
I don' t know.
I just...
I see such a beautiful woman.
Great skin.
I' d like to see you happy, that' s all.
Is this the part where you offer to turn me?
Well, it' s either that or a body bag.
Go ahead.
Bite me.
I' il just cure myself.
I did it before, and I can do it again.
There is no cure, baby.
There is if you' ve been bit, if you were once human.
How' d you get that scar, Deacon?
A born vampire would have the power to regenerate from birth.
You must' ve gotten scarred before you were turned.
Isn' t that right?
Vampires like you aren' t a species.
You' re just... infected, a virus... a sexually transmitted disease.
I' il tell you what we are, sister.
We' re the top of the fucking food chain.
The Blood God' s coming.
And after tonight, you people are fucking history.
He' s a hurricane, an act of God.
Anyone caught in his path will instantly be turned.
Everyone you' ve ever known, everyone you' ve ever fucking loved.
It won' t matter who' s pureblood and who' s not.
How are you gonna cure the whole fucking world?
Hmm?
And Blade' s blood is the key.
[Tyres peeling]
Deac, I don' t think you understand.
What?
He' s, like, he had 20 guys around him -- and he' s got shit he throws at you --
Yeah, the swords.
Throw it in the air, catch it underneath.
Yeah.
[Over radio]
There' s no intruder where we are.
It' s one guy on foot.
That' s him!
Get him!
Why am I hearing gunfire?
Did I tell anybody to start shooting?
I need him alive.
No!
Please!
I just work for them!
Jesus Christ.
Lock this place down.
Aah!
Aieee!
Eric?
I came back, Eric.
That very same night... when Deacon welcomed me into his arms.
Jesus Christ.
I thought you' d be happy.
You' re finally being reunited with your mother, and you act like this?
Blade, give it up.
It' s over.
Uh!
Don' t look so surprised.
looking for the vampire who bit your mother.
Well, here I am.
Who would ever guess you' d survive your mother' s death?
But you did.
And here we are -- one big happy fucking family.
I need my serum.
I' il take that miracle cure of yours.
There' s one catch.
If it works, you' il lose your strength and your ability to regenerate.
You' il be completely human.
Blade, Karen, glad you could make it.
Hey, man.
Thanks for the shades.
Our ancestors called this place the Temple of Eternal Night.
Nice, isn' t it?
Apparently, these geniuses forgot it ever existed.
Fortunately for us...
I' m what you might call a... student of history.
Why are we here?
This temple was built for one glorious moment -- this night, for the Blood God.
Thanks.
Let' s see this sword of yours.
Well.
Titanium, right?
Acid- etched?
I' il get used to a weapon like this.
What?
You look surprised.
I know everything about you.
Hold out your arm, Quinn.
Why, man?
These are -- they' re, like, all better.
Hold out your arm.
Now.
Deac, I --
Just kidding.
He was, like, fucking...
Blade.
Blade.
He can' t hear you, honey.
The thirst has got him now.
What do we have here?
Mm.
How long' s it been since you shot up?
12, 13 hours maybe?
I bet you' re just dying for a drink, aren' t you?
What' s it feel like?
Is your blood on fire?
Try some.
You might like it.
Thanks, but I prefer the real thing.
I don' t think you' il be needing these any more.
It' s a shame, you know?
When I think of what you' ve become, what you should have become.
I guess I don' t blame you.
I mean, with everything that' s happened, it' s the human side of you that' s made you weak.
You should' ve listened to your blood.
Ooh.
Get him outta here.
Get these fucks downstairs.
Let' s go.
Let' s go.
Don' t worry, sweetheart.
We haven' t forgotten about you.
We got something real special planned for you.
That surfer boy had a nice ass.
I sucked him dry.
And you' d figure he' d turn, man.
Yeah, but he didn' t turn, did he?
It happens sometimes, cutie.
He was fucking tripped out.
Pathetic.
Yeah.
These guys are complete scums, man.
They' il even eat vampires.
That' s a plus.
I' d like you to meet an old friend of yours.
Uh!
It' s too bad.
I kinda liked her.
I don' t know what' s happening to me.
No pulse.
And, of course, there' s the question of lividity.
Curtis?
Karen?
Karen.
I never thought I would see you again.
[Roar]
Karen!
Karen!
Karen!
Karen!
Karen.
Karen!
Poor child.
You' re so sick.
So thirsty.
Don' t touch me.
Eric, look at me.
Vampires are my people now.
I' m one of them.
Can' t be.
Yes, it can.
Try to understand, Eric.
Your mother died a long time ago.
I' ve killed... and I' ve enjoyed it.
Haven' t you?
I know you have.
Sooner or later, the thirst always wins.
Come on.
Spread them out.
One on each glyph, under the towers.
Make it perfect.
FROST:
You stupid girl.
What do you think is going to happen?
La Magra?
The Blood God?
That' s nothing more than a fairy tale for pretty little vampires.
Then why are you sweating, pureblood?
You' re afraid we' re gonna steal your soul, your pureblood spirit.
You should be.
Read the prophecy.
It' s time you fucks contributed something to the cause.
Even if Frost is right, you really think he cares about you?
Waah!
Blade.
Tonight, the age of man comes to an end.
No more compromises.
We' re gonna be gods.
Of course we are.
Yeah!
I' m gonna be naughty.
I' m gonna be a naughty Vampire God.
Gotta stop... stop...
Save your strength.
Blue.
You' re hypovolemic.
You' re bleeding to death.
[Gasping]
Blade.
Blade.
Listen to me.
I want you to take some of my blood.
No.
No.
Look, just do it.
Is everybody thirsty?
[Panting]
Ohh... don' t stop.
Don' t stop.
Don' t stop.
Aah!
Aah!
Eric...
I' m your mother.
You wouldn' t hurt your mother... would you?
Come here.
Aah!
[Groaning]
Aah!
Deacon?
Frost!
Kill him.
Wait!
I owe you, man.
I got two new hands, Blade.
Yaah!
Frost.
I got struck by lightning
Hey, Blade.
Let' s do this.
You' re too late, Blade.
[Laughs]
Look at you.
You' re a little bitch.
What, your serum?
It can' t help you now, stud.
Nice shot.
KAREN:
Blade!
Let' s get out of here.
I need to get back to the lab if I' m going to cure you.
It' s not over.
You keep your cure.
There' s still a war going on, and I have a job to do.
[Woman speaking Russian]
People are always asking me if I know Tyler Durden.
Tyler:
Tyler:
3 minutes.
This is it: ground zero.
Would you like to say a few words to mark the occasion?
With a gun barrel between your teeth, you speak only in vowels.
I can' t think of anything.
For a second I totally forget about Tyler' s whole controlled demolition thing, and I wonder how clean that gun is.
Getting exciting now.
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love?
Well, it works both ways.
We have front row seats for this theater of mass destruction.
The demolitions committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.
In 2 minutes, primary charges will blow base charges and a few square blocks will be reduced to smoldering rubble.
I know this... because Tyler knows this.
2 1/ 2.
Think of everything we' ve accomplished.
And suddenly, I realize that all of this: the gun, the bombs, the revolution... has got something to do with a girl named Marla Singer.
Bob.
Bob had bitch- tits.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.
The big moosey slobbering all over me, that was Bob.
We' re still men.
Yes, we' re men.
Men is what we are.
8 months ago, Bob' s testicles were removed.
Then hormone therapy.
He developed bitch- tits because his testosterone was too high, and his body upped the estrogen.
And that was where I fit...
Between those huge, sweating tits that hung enormous the way you' d think of God' s as big.
You cry now.
No, wait.
Back up.
Let me start earlier.
For 6 months, I couldn' t sleep.
I couldn' t sleep.
With insomnia, nothing' s real.
Everything' s far away.
Everything' s a copy of a copy of a copy.
When deep space exploration ramps up, it' il be the corporations that name everything: the I. B. M. Stellarsphere, the Microsoft Galaxy,
Planet Starbucks.
We got some red flags to cover.
It must' ve been Tuesday.
He was wearing his cornflower- blue tie.
You want me to deprioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
Make these your primary action items.
Here' s your flight coupons.
Call me from the road if there' s any snags.
He was full of pep.
Must have had his grandé latté enema.
Like so many others, I had become a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.
I' d like to order the Erica Pekkary dust ruffles.
Operator:
like a little coffee table in the shape of a Yin- Yang,
The Klipske personal office unit, the Hovetrekke home exer- bike, or the Johannshamn sofa with the Strinne green stripe pattern.
Even the Rizlampa wire lamps of environmentally friendly unbleached paper.
I' d flip through catalogs and wonder:
What kind of dining set defines me as a person?
I had it all.
Proof that they were crafted by the honest, simple, hard- working indigenous peoples of --
Narrator:
We used to read pornography.
Now it was the Horchow collection.
No, you can' t die from insomnia.
What about narcolepsy?
I wake up in strange places.
I have no idea how I got there.
You need to lighten up.
Can you please just get me something?
Red and blue Tuenols, lipstick- red Seconals.
No.
You need healthy natural sleep.
Chew some Valerian root and get more exercise.
Hey, come on.
I' m in pain.
Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.
See the guys with testicular cancer.
That' s pain.
I always wanted 3 kids, 2 boys and a girl.
Mindy wanted 2 girls and a boy.
We never could agree on anything.
Well, uh, you know, she --
She had her first child last week, a... a girl.
With -- With her, uh, with her new husband.
Fuck.
Hey -- Hey, thank God, you know.
I' m -- I' m glad for her.
Because she deserves it.
Everyone, let' s thank Thomas for sharing himself with us.
Thank you, Thomas.
I look around this room, and I see a lot of courage, and that gives me strength.
We give each other strength.
It' s time for the one- on- ones.
So let' s all of us here follow Thomas' good example and really open ourselves up.
Would you find a partner?
And this is how I met the big moosey...
Let' s go over here.
His eyes already shrink- wrapped in tears... knees together, those awkward little steps.
My name is Bob.
Bob.
Bob had been a champion body- builder.
You know that chest- expansion program you see on late- night TV?
That was his idea.
I was a juicer.
You know, using steroids.
Diabonal and...
Oh, they use that on racehorses, for Christ sakes.
And now I' m bankrupt.
I' m divorced.
My 2 grown kids... won' t even return my phone calls.
Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.
Go ahead, Cornelius.
And then, something happened.
I let go.
That' s really good.
Lost in oblivion... dark and silent and complete.
I found freedom.
Losing all hope was freedom.
It' s OK.
Babies don' t sleep this well.
I became addicted.
If I didn' t say anything... people always assumed the worst.
Welcome, Travis.
They cried harder... then I cried harder.
Now we' re going to open the green door, the heart chakra.
I wasn' t really dying.
I wasn' t host to cancer or parasites.
I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around. that the life of this world crowded around.
Imagine your pain as a white ball of healing light.
It moves over your body, healing you.
Now, keep this going.
Remember to breathe, and step forward through the back door of the room.
Where does it lead?
To your cave.
Step forward into your cave.
That' s right.
You' re going deeper into your cave, and you' re going to find your power animal.
Slide.
Narrator:
Every evening, I died... and every evening, I was born again.
Resurrected.
Bob loved me because he thought my testicles were removed, too.
Being there... pressed against his tits, ready to cry.
This was my vacation.
And she ruined everything.
This is cancer, right?
This chick Marla Singer did not have testicular cancer.
She was a liar.
She had no diseases at all.
I had seen her at Free and Clear my blood parasites group Thursdays.
Then at Hope, my bimonthly sickle cell circle.
[Coughs Softly]
Marla, the big tourist.
Her lie reflected my lie, and suddenly, I felt nothing.
I couldn' t cry.
So once again, I couldn' t sleep.
Marla Singer and scream...
Marla, you liar!
You big tourist!
I need this!
I hadn' t slept in 4 days.
We' il just let that dry.
When you have insomnia, you' re never really asleep... and you' re never really awake.
To begin tonight' s communion,
Chloe would like to say a few words.
Oh, yeah...
Meryl Streep' s skeleton would look if you made it smile and walk around the party being extra nice to everybody.
Well, I' m still here, but I don' t know for how long.
That' s as much certainty as anyone can give me.
But I' ve got some good news.
I no longer have any fear of death.
But I am in a pretty lonely place.
No one will have sex with me.
I' m so close to the end, and all I want is to get laid for the last time.
I have pornographic movies in my apartment,
and lubricants and amyl nitrate.
Chloe...
Everyone, let' s thank Chloe.
[Audience Saying Thank You]
Now, let' s... ready ourself for guided meditation.
You' re standing at the entrance of your cave.
You step inside your cave, and you walk.
If I did have a tumor...
I' d name it Marla.
Marla... the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can' t.... deeper into your cave as you walk.
You feel the healing energy of this place all around you.
Now find your power animal.
Slide.
Now let' s partner up.
Pick someone special to you tonight.
Hey.
We need to talk.
Sure.
I' m onto you.
What?
You' re a faker.
You' re not dying.
Sorry?
I know we' re all -- we' re all dying, all right?
So?
So you' re a tourist.
I saw you -- saw you at melanoma, saw you at tuberculosis,
I saw you at testicular cancer.
I saw you practicing this.
Telling me off.
Is it going as well as you hoped...
"RUPERT"?
I' il expose you.
Go ahead.
Leader:
All right, come together.
Let yourselves cry.
[Crying Softly]
Oh, God, why are you doing this?
It' s cheaper than a movie, and there' s free coffee.
No, look... this is important, OK?
I' ve been coming here for over a year.
Why do you do it?
I don' t know.
When people think you' re dying, man, they really, really listen to you instead of just...
Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
Yeah.
Share yourself... completely.
OK, you don' t want to get into this.
It becomes an addiction.
Really?
I' m not kidding.
I can' t cry if there' s another faker present, and I need this.
So you got to find somewhere else to go.
Candy stripe a cancer ward.
It' s not my problem.
Wait, wait, wait.
I' il tell you.
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis --
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn' t go over at all.
Good.
Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest, I think.
Well, technically,
I have more right to be there than you.
You still have your balls.
You' re kidding.
I don' t know.
No.
No.
What do you want?
I' il take the parasites.
You can' t have both the parasites, but why don' t you take the blood parasites --
I want brain parasites.
I' il take the blood parasites, but I' m gonna take the organic brain dementia --
You can' t have the whole brain.
I only have 2.
OK.
Take both the parasites.
Now we both have 3.
Hey, you left half your clothes!
What, are you selling those?
I' m selling some clothes.
That' s 6.
What about the seventh day?
I want ascending bowel cancer.
Thank you.
No.
No, I...
I want bowel cancer.
That' s your favorite, too?
Try to slip it by me, eh?
Look, we' re gonna split it, OK?
Take the first and third Sunday of the month.
Deal.
Looks like this is good- bye.
Well, let' s not make a big thing out of it, OK?
How' s this for not making a big thing?
Hey, Marla!
Marla!
May- Maybe we should exchange numbers.
Should we?
OK.
This is how I met Marla Singer.
Marla' s philosophy of life was that she might die at any moment.
The tragedy, she said, was that she didn' t.
It doesn' t have your name.
Who are you,
Cornelius, Rupert,
Travis, any of the stupid names you give each night?
You wake up at Seatac.
S. F. O...
L. A. X...
Dallas- Fort Worth...
B. W. I...
Pacific, mountain, central...
Lose an hour, gain an hour...
Check- in for that flight doesn' t begin for another 2 hours, sir.
This is your life, and it' s ending one minute at a time.
You wake up at Air Harbor International...
If you wake up at a different time, in a different place, could you wake up as a different person?
Everywhere I travel, tiny life... single- serving sugar... single- serving cream... single pat of butter... a microwave cordon- bleu hobby kit.
Shampoo- conditioner combos.
Sample package mouthwash, tiny bars of soap.
The people I meet on each flight, they' re single- serving friends.
Between takeoff and landing, we have our time together, but that' s all we get.
Welcome!
On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.
I was a recall coordinator.
My job was to apply the formula.
Here' s where the infant went through the windshield.
A new car built by my company
leaves somewhere traveling at 60 miles per hour.
The teenager' s braces are wrapped around the back seat ashtray.
Might make a good antismoking ad.
The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside.
Now, should we initiate a recall?
The father must' ve been huge.
You see where the fat has burned to the seat, the polyester shirt?
- Ha ha ha!
Narrator:
Take the number of vehicles in the field, "A," multiply it by the probable rate of failure, "B," then multiply the result by the average out- of- court settlement, "C."
"A" times "B" times "C" equals "X."
If" X "is less than the cost of a recall, we don' t do one.
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?
You wouldn' t believe.
Which car company do you work for?
A major one.
I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.
Anything.
Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip.
"And you feel you would be unable or unwilling to perform the duties
It' s a lot of responsibility.
Wanna switch seats?
I' m not sure I' m the man for that particular job.
Mm- hmm.
The illusion of safety.
Yeah.
You know why they put oxygen masks on planes?
So you can breathe.
Oxygen gets you high.
In a catastrophic emergency, you' re taking giant panicked breaths.
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.
You accept your fate.
It' s all right here.
Emergency water landing -- 600 miles an hour.
Blank faces, calm as Hindu cows.
That' s, um...
That' s an interesting theory.
What do you do?
What do you do for a living?
Why?
So you can pretend like you' re interested?
OK.
You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.
We have the exact same briefcase.
Soap.
Sorry?
I make and I sell soap -- the yardstick of civilization.
And this is how I met...
"Tyler Durden."
Did you know, if you mixed equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice concentrate, you can make napalm?
No, I did not know that.
Is that true?
That' s right.
One can make all kinds of explosives using simple household items.
Really?
If one were so inclined.
"single- serving" friend I' ve ever met.
See, obviously, everything on a plane is single- serving, even --
Oh, I get it.
It' s very clever.
Thank you.
How' s that working out for you?
Being clever.
Great.
Keep it up, then.
Right up.
Now a question of etiquette.
As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?
Narrator:
How I came to live with Tyler is... airlines have this policy about vibrating luggage.
Was -- Was it ticking?
'cause modern bombs don' t tick.
"Throwers"?
Baggage handlers.
But when a suitcase vibrates, then the thrower' s gotta call the police.
My suitcase... was vibrating?
9 times out of 10, it' s an electric razor, but every once in a while...
it' s a dildo.
Of course, it' s company policy never to imply ownership in the event of a dildo.
Never your dildo.
I don' t own a --
Narrator:
I had everything in that suitcase -- my CK shirts, my DKNY shoes, my AX ties.
Never mind.
Hey!
That' s my car!
Home was a condo on the 15th floor of a filing cabinet for widows and young professionals.
The walls were solid concrete.
A foot of concrete' s important when your next- door neighbor lets her hearing aid go and has to watch game shows at full volume...
Or when a volcanic blast and debris that used to be your furniture and personal effects blows out of your floor- to- ceiling windows and sails flaming into the night.
I suppose these things happen.
There' s nothing up there.
You can' t go into the unit.
Do you have somebody you can call?
How embarrassing.
A house full of condiments and no food.
letting out just a little bit of gas.
That gas could have slowly filled the condo -- 1, 700 square feet of high ceilings for days and days.
[Telephone Ringing]
Yeah?
I can hear you breathing, you --
I couldn' t tell you why I called him.
Hello?
Man:
Tyler?
Who is this?
Um, ahem, we met on the airplane.
We had the same suitcase.
Uh, the clever guy.
Oh, yeah.
I called a second ago.
There was no answer.
I' m at a pay phone.
I star- 69ed you.
I never pick up my phone.
So, what' s up, man?
Uh, well... you' re not gonna believe this.
You know, man, it could be worse.
A woman could cut off your penis while you' re sleeping and toss it out the window of a moving car.
There' s always that.
I don' t know, it' s just... when you buy furniture, you tell yourself, that' s it.
That' s the last sofa I' m gonna need.
I' ve got that sofa problem handled.
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent, a wardrobe that was getting very respectable.
I was close to being complete.
Now it' s all gone.
All gone.
All gone.
Do you know what a duvet is?
Comforter.
It' s a blanket. just a blanket.
Why do guys like you and I know what a duvet is?
Is this essential to our survival in the hunter- gatherer sense of the word?
No.
What are we, then?
We' re, uh, you know, consumers...
We' re consumers.
We are by- products of a lifestyle obsession.
Murder, crime, poverty -- these things don' t concern me.
What concerns me are celebrity magazines, television with 500 channels, some guy' s name on my underwear.
Rogaine, Viagra, Olestra.
Martha Stewart.
Fuck Martha Stewart.
Martha' s polishing the brass on the Titanic.
It' s all going down, man.
So fuck off with your sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns.
I say, never be complete.
I say, stop being perfect.
let' s evolve.
Let the chips fall where they may.
But that' s me, and I could be wrong.
Maybe it' s a terrible tragedy.
It' s just stuff.
It' s not a tragedy, but...
Well, you did lose a lot of versatile solutions for modern living.
You' re right.
I don' t smoke.
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...
What?
The things you own end up owning you.
But do what you like, man.
Oh, it' s late.
Hey, thanks for the beer.
Yeah, man.
I should find a hotel.
What?
What?
A hotel.
Yeah. just ask, man.
What are you talking about?
3 pitchers of beer, and you still can' t ask.
What?
You called me 'cause you needed a place to stay.
Oh, hey, no, no, no.
Yes, you did.
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.
Would that be a problem?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
Can I stay at your place?
Thanks.
I want you to do me a favor.
Yeah, sure.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
What?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.
Tyler was a night person.
While the rest of us were sleeping, he worked.
He had one part- time job as a projectionist.
See, a movie doesn' t come all on one big reel.
It comes on a few.
So someone has to be there to switch the projectors at the exact moment that one reel ends and the next one begins.
If you look for it, you can see these little dots come into the upper right- hand corner of the screen.
In the industry, we call them "cigarette burns."
That' s the cue for a changeover.
He flips the projectors, the movie keeps right on going, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
Why would anyone want this shit job?
Because it affords him other interesting opportunities.
Like splicing single frames of pornography into family films.
So when the snooty cat and the courageous dog with the celebrity voices meet for the first time in reel 3, that' s when you' il catch a flash of Tyler' s contribution to the film.
Nobody knows that they saw it, but they did.
A nice big cock.
Even a hummingbird couldn' t catch Tyler at work.
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet waiter at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.
He was the guerilla terrorist of the food service industry.
Do not watch.
And as for the cream of mushroom soup, well...
Go ahead, tell them.
You get the idea.
What do you want me to do?
You just want me to hit you?
Do me this one favor.
Why?
I don' t know.
I' ve never been in a fight.
Have you?
No, but that' s a good thing.
No, it is not.
I don' t wanna die without any scars.
So, come on, hit me before I lose my nerve.
God, this is crazy.
Let 'er rip.
Hey, I don' t know about this.
I don' t, either, but who gives a shit?
No one' s watching.
What do you care?
This is crazy.
You want me to hit you?
That' s right.
What, like, in the face?
Surprise me.
This is so fucking stupid.
Motherfucker!
You hit me in the ear.
Ow!
Christ!
Why the ear, man?
That was perfect.
Nah, it' s all right.
That really hurts.
Right.
[Laughing]
You hit me.
Come on.
We should do this again sometime.
Where' s your car?
What car?
I don' t know how Tyler found that house, but he said he' d been there for a year.
It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.
Most of the windows were boarded up.
There was no lock on the front door from when the police or whoever kicked it in.
The stairs were ready to collapse.
I didn' t know if he owned it or if he was squatting.
Neither would have surprised me.
Yeah.
That' s you.
That' s the toilet.
Good?
Thanks.
Narrator:
[Springs Clang]
Turning on one light meant another light in the house went out.
There were no neighbors, just some warehouses and a paper mill -- that fart smell of steam, the hamster cage smell of wood chips.
What have we here?
Hey, guys.
Hey.
Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.
I didn' t miss TV.
I didn' t even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.
Can I be next?
All right, man.
Lose the tie.
At night, Tyler and I were alone for a half a mile in every direction.
Rain trickled down through the plaster and the light fixtures.
Everything wooden swelled and shrank.
Everywhere were rusted nails to snag your elbow on.
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut- in.
Hey, man, what are you reading?
Listen to this.
It' s an article written by an organ in the first person.
"I am Jack' s medulla oblongata.
Without me, Jack could not regulate his heart rate, blood pressure, or breathing. "
There' s a whole series of these.
"I am Jill' s nipples."
"I am Jack' s colon."
I kill Jack. "
After fighting, everything else in your life got the volume turned down.
[Muted Complaining]
You could deal with anything.
Have you finished those reports?
If you could fight anyone, who would you fight?
I' d fight my boss, probably.
Really?
Yeah.
Why, who would you fight?
I' d fight my dad.
I don' t know my dad.
I mean, I know him, but he left when I was, like, 6 years old, married this other woman and had some other kids.
He, like, did this every 6 years.
He goes to a new city and starts a new family.
Fucker should open up franchises.
My dad never went to college, so it was real important that I go.
That sounds familiar.
So I graduate, I call him up long distance.
I say, "Dad, now what?"
He says, "Get a job."
Same here.
Now I' m 25.
I make my yearly call again.
I say, "Dad, now what?"
He says, "I don' t know.
Get married. "
I can' t get married.
I' m a 30- year- old boy.
We' re a generation of men raised by women.
I' m wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.
Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.
But every Saturday night, we were finding something out.
We were finding out more and more that we were not alone.
It used to be that when I came home angry or depressed,
I' d just clean my condo, polish my Scandinavian furniture.
I should' ve been haggling with my insurance company.
I should' ve been upset about my nice, neat flaming little shit.
But I wasn' t.
The basic premise of cyber- netting any office is make things more efficient.
Monday mornings, all I could do was think about next week.
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
Absolutely.
Efficiency is priority number one, people, because waste is a thief.
I showed this already to my man, here.
You liked it, didn' t you?
You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick.
It was right in everyone' s face.
Tyler and I just made it visible.
It was on the tip of everyone' s tongue.
Tyler and I just gave it a name.
[Loud Rock Music Playing]
Come on, people, you gotta go home.
Turn off the jukebox.
Lock the back.
Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.
Gentlemen, welcome to Fight Club.
The first rule of Fight Club is... you do not talk about Fight Club.
The second rule of Fight Club is... you do not talk about Fight Club.
Third rule of Fight Club --
Someone yells "Stop!" goes limp, taps out, the fight is over.
Fourth rule --
Only 2 guys to a fight.
Fifth rule --
One fight at a time, fellas.
[Laughter]
Sixth rule -- No shirts, no shoes.
Seventh rule --
Fights will go on as long as they have to.
And the eighth and final rule --
If this is your first night at Fight Club... you have to fight.
This kid from work, Ricky, couldn' t remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black...
But Ricky was a god for 10 minutes when the trounced the maitre d 'of a local food court.
Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat, hard packing sounds over the yelling...
or the wet choke when someone caught their breath and sprayed...
Stop!
You weren' t alive anywhere like you were there.
But Fight Club only exists in the hours between when Fight Club starts and when Fight Club ends.
I wouldn' t be talking to the same man.
Who you were in Fight Club is not who you were in the rest of the world.
The guy who came to Fight Club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.
After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
If you could fight any celebrity, who would you fight?
Alive or dead?
It doesn' t matter.
Who' d be tough?
Hemingway.
You?
I' d fight William Shatner.
We all started seeing things differently.
Everywhere we went, we were sizing things up.
I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms, trying to look like how Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.
Is that what a man looks like?
Self- improvement is masturbation.
And self- destruction.
Excuse me.
Fight Club wasn' t about winning or losing.
It wasn' t about words.
like in a Pentecostal church.
- Is that it?
- Stop!
When the fight was over, nothing was solved, but nothing mattered.
Hey, cool.
Narrator:
Afterwards, we all felt saved.
Hey, man, how about next week?
How about next month?
Irwin, you' re in the middle.
You, too.
Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.
He fell down some stairs.
I fell down some stairs.
Fight Club became the reason to cut your hair short or trim your fingernails.
Any historical figure.
I' d fight Gandhi.
Good answer.
How about you?
Lincoln.
Mm.
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they' re burger.
Fuck.
Even the Mona Lisa' s falling apart.
Hello.
Where have you been the last 8 weeks?
Marla?
How' d you find me?
You left that forwarding number.
I haven' t seen you in any support groups.
We split them up.
That was the idea, remember?
Yeah, but you haven' t been going to yours.
How do you know?
I cheated.
I found a new one.
Really?
Like the testicle thing?
Look, this is a bad time.
I' ve been going to Debtors Anonymous.
You wanna see some really fucked up people?
I' m just on my way out.
I' ve got a stomachful of Xanax.
I took what was left of a bottle.
It might have been too much.
Just picture watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
But this isn' t a for- real suicide thing.
This is probably one of those cry- for- help things.
So you' re staying in tonight, then?
Do you wanna wait and hear me describe death?
Do you wanna listen and see if my spirit can use a phone?
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
Tyler' s door was closed.
I' d been living here for 2 months, and Tyler' s door was never closed.
You won' t believe this dream I had last night.
Yeah, I can hardly believe anything about last night.
What -- What are you doing here?
What?
This is my house.
What are you doing in my house?
Fuck you.
Oh, you got some fucked- up friends, I' m tellin 'you.
[Chuckling]
Limber, though... silly coos.
So, I come in last night.
Guess who' s on the other end.
I already knew the story before he told it to me.
Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
Do you think it' il live up to its name?
Or will it just be a death... hairball?
Prepare... to evacuate soul.
9... 8...
Marla:
5... 4... 3 -- Oh, hang on.
You got here fast.
Did I call you?
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.
Oh, don' t worry.
It' s not a threat to you.
Oh, fuck.
Somebody called the cops.
Hey, where' s 513?
End of the hall.
You know, the girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl.
She' s lost faith in herself.
Miss Singer!
She' s a monster.
You have every reason to live!
She' s infectious human waste!
Miss Singer!
Good luck trying to save her!
If I fall asleep, I' m done for.
You' re gonna have to keep me up... all... night.
Un- fucking- believable.
He was obviously able to handle it.
You fucked her.
No, I didn' t.
Never?
You' re not into her, are you?
God, not at all.
I am Jack' s raging bile duct.
Are you sure?
You can tell me.
Believe me, I' m sure.
Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brains.
That' s good, 'cause she' s a predator posing as a house pet.
And the shit that came out of this woman' s mouth
My God.
I haven' t been fucked like that since grade school.
Narrator:
The night before last, he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.
She needs a fucking case worker.
She needs a wash.
And she' s in love with sport fuckin '.
She invaded my support groups.
Now she' d invaded my home.
Hey, hey.
Can' t have you talking to her about me.
Why would I talk to her --
You say anything about me or what goes on in this house to her or to anybody, we' re done.
Now, promise me.
OK.
You promise?
- Yeah, I promise.
- Promise.
I just said I promise.
That' s 3 times you promised.
If only I had wasted a couple of minutes and gone to watch Marla Singer die, none of this would' ve happened.
Oh!
Harder!
[Tyler And Marla Shouting Passionately]
Marla:
But I didn' t.
What are you doin '? just goin' to bed.
[Marla Moans]
No.
I found the cigarettes.
Who are you talking to?
Shut up.
I became the calm little center of the world.
I was the Zen master.
Ohh!
I wrote little haiku poems.
I e- mailed them to everyone.
Is that your blood?
Some of it, yeah.
[Snickers]
Take the rest of the day off.
Come back Monday with some clean clothes.
Get yourself together.
I got right in everyone' s hostile little face.
Yes, these are bruises from fighting.
Yes, I' m comfortable with that.
I... am enlightened.
Ohh!
[Ring]
This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.
We have some new information about the incident at your former condo.
I don' t know if you' re aware, but it seems that someone sprayed freon into your front door lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
No, I wasn' t aware of that at all.
I am Jack' s cold sweat.
Does this sound strange to you?
Strange.
The dynamite --
Dynamite?
left a residue of ammonium oxylate potassium chloride.
Do you know what this means?
What does it mean?
It means it was homemade.
This is just coming as quite a shock to me, sir.
See, whoever set this homemade dynamite could' ve blown out your pilot light days before the actual explosion.
The gas was just the detonator.
Who would go and do such a thing?
I' il ask the questions.
Tell him the liberator who destroyed my property has realigned my perception.
Detective:
Are you there?
No, I am listening.
It' s a little hard to know what to make of all this.
Have you recently made enemies with anyone who might have access to homemade dynamite?
- Enemies?
- Reject the basic assumption of civilization, especially the importance of material possessions.
Detective:
Yes, I know it' s serious.
I mean that.
Yes, it' s very serious.
Look, nobody takes this more seriously than me.
That condo was my life.
I loved every stick of furniture in that place.
That was not just a bunch of stuff that got destroyed.
It was me!
I' d like to thank the Academy.
Is this not a good time for you? just tell him you fuckin 'did it.
Tell him you blew it all up.
That' s what he wants to hear.
Are you still there?
Are you saying that I' m a suspect?
No, no.
I may need to talk to you a little further, so how about you just lettin 'me know if you' re gonna leave town?
OK?
OK.
Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
My parents pulled this exact same act for years.
The condom is the glass slipper of our generation.
You... dance all night.
Then you throw it away.
Not the stranger.
What?
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1. 00.
It was worth every penny.
It' s a bridesmaid' s dress.
Someone loved it... intensely for one day... then tossed it.
Like a Christmas tree... so special... then... bam... it' s on the side of the road... tinsel still clinging to it...
like a sex crime victim... underwear inside out... bound with electrical tape.
Well, then it suits you.
You can borrow it sometime.
Get rid of her.
Why can' t you get rid of her?
Don' t mention me.
I' m 6 years old again, passing messages between parents.
I really think it' s time you got out of here.
Not that we don' t love your little visits.
You are such a nut case.
I can' t even begin to keep up.
Gotta get off
Bye.
Gotta get off this merry- go- round
[Continues Singing, Indistinctly]
Gotta get on where
You kids.
Why do you still waste time with her?
I' il say this about Marla -- at least she' s tryin 'to hit bottom.
What, and I' m not?
Stickin 'feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken.
What are we doin 'tonight?
- Yeah.
Really.
To make soap, first we render fat.
The salt balance has to be just right, so the best fat for making soap comes from humans.
What is this place?
A liposuction clinic.
Pay dirt.
The richest, creamiest fat in the world.
Come on.
Oh, God!
Oh!
As the fat renders, the tallows float to the surface.
Like in Boy Scouts.
I can imagine you as a Boy Scout.
Keep stirrin '.
Once the tallow hardens, we skim off a layer of glycerin.
If you were to add nitric acid, you got nitroglycerin.
If you were then to add sodium nitrate and a dash of sawdust, you got dynamite.
Yeah, with enough soap, we could blow up just about anything.
Tyler was full of useful information.
Now, ancient peoples found that clothes got cleaner when they washed them at a certain point in the river.
- You know why?
Human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river.
Bodies burned.
Water seeped into the wood and ashes to create lye.
This is lye, the crucial ingredient.
Once it mixed with the melted fat of bodies, a thick, white, soapy discharge crept into the river.
May I see your hand, please?
What is this?
Uh -- Aah!
It' il hurt more than you' ve ever been burned, and you will have a scar.
If meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this.
Don' t shove to center.
No, no!
The first soap was made from the ashes of heroes,
Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothin '.
I tried not to think of the the words "sear" or "flesh."
Stop it!
It' s right here.
I' m going to my cave and find my power animal.
No!
Don' t deal with it the way those dead people do!
Come on!
OK!
No.
What you' re feeling is premature enlightenment.
This is the greatest moment of your life, man, and you' re off somewhere --
Shut up.
Our fathers were our models for God.
If our fathers bailed, what does that tell you about God?
Listen to me.
You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you,
In all probability, He hates you.
This is not the worst thing that can happen.
We don' t need Him.
We don' t!
Fuck redemption.
We are God' s unwanted children?
So be it!
[Shouting Incomprehensibly]
Listen!
You can run water over your hand to make it worse, or -- look at me -- or you can use vinegar to neutralize the burn.
Please let me have some!
First you have to give up.
First you have to know, not fear, know that someday you' re gonna die.
You don' t know how this feels!
It' s only after we' ve lost everything that we' re free to do anything.
OK.
Congratulations.
You' re one step closer to hitting bottom.
Tyler sold his soap to department stores at $20 a bar.
God knows what they charged.
This is the best soap.
It was beautiful.
We were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them.
He was wearing his yellow tie.
I didn' t even wear a tie to work anymore.
"The first rule of Fight Club is you don' t talk about Fight Club"?
I' m half asleep again.
I must' ve left the original in the copy machine.
"The second rule of Fight Club --" Is this yours?
Pretend you' re me.
Make a managerial decision.
You find this.
What would you do?
I' d be very, very careful who you talk to about that.
Because the person who wrote that... is dangerous.
And this buttoned- down, Oxford- cloth psycho might just snap and then stalk from office to office with an Armilade AR- 10 carbine gas- powered semi- automatic weapon, pumping round after round into colleagues and coworkers.
This might be someone you' ve known for years... someone very... very... close to you.
Tyler' s words coming out of my mouth.
And I used to be such a nice guy.
Maybe you shouldn' t bring me every little piece of trash you happen to pick up.
Liability.
My tit' s gonna rot off.
I need to take this.
What' re you talking about?
I need you to check and see if there' s a lump in my breast.
Go to a hospital.
I can' t afford to throw money away on a doctor.
I don' t know about this, Marla.
Please?
She didn' t call Tyler.
I' m neutral in her book.
That' s nice.
Hannaburr, Mrs. Raines?
Who are they... exactly?
Tragically, they' re dead.
I' m alive, and I' m in poverty.
You want any?
No.
I got one for you.
Thanks for the thought.
What happened to your hand?
Uh... nothin '.
Uhh.
Feel anything?
No.
Well, make sure.
Ok, I' m -- I' m pretty sure.
Nothing.
Well, that' s a relief.
Uh, um... no problem.
I wish I could return the favor.
There' s not a lot of breast cancer in the men in my family.
Could check your prostate.
I think I' m OK.
Well, thanks, anyway.
Are we done?
Yeah, we' re done.
See you... around.
Cornelius?
Cornelius!
It' s me...
Bob!
Bob.
We all thought you were dead.
No, no.
Still here.
How are you, Bob?
Better than I' ve ever been in my whole life.
You still remaining men together?
No, no.
Really.
What is it?
Well... first rule is...
And the second rule is,
I' m not supposed to talk about it.
Bob.
Bob.
I' m a member.
Look at my face, Bob.
That' s fuckin '-- That' s fuckin' great.
I' ve never seen you there.
I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I go Saturday.
Congratulations.
Hey, to both of us, right?
Well, uh, yeah, actually.
I --
I hear all kinds of things.
And he sleeps only one hour a night.
He' s a great man.
Do you know about Tyler Durden?
I didn' t hurt you, did I?
Actually, you did.
Thank you for this.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Bob.
Bob.
This was mine and Tyler' s gift... our gift to the world.
I see a lot of new faces.
Shut up!
Which means a lot of you have been breaking the first 2 rules of Fight Club.
Man, I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who' ve ever lived.
I see all this potential.
And I see squandering.
God damn it.
An entire generation pumping gas... waiting tables... slaves with white collars.
Advertising has its taste in cars and clothes... working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don' t need.
We' re the middle children of history, man.
No purpose or place.
We have no Great War... no Great Depression.
Our Great War' s a spiritual war.
Our Great Depression is our lives.
We' ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we' d all be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars.
But we won' t.
We' re slowly learning that fact.
And we' re very, very pissed off.
First rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about --
Who are you?
Who am I?
Yeah.
There' s a sign in the front that says "Lou' s Tavern."
I' m fuckin 'Lou.
Who the fuck are you?
Tyler Durden.
Who told you motherfuckers that you could use my place?
Irvin?
Irvin' s at home with a broken collarbone.
He don' t own this place.
How much money is he gettin 'for this?
There is no money.
Ain' t that somethin '?
- Free to all.
It is, actually.
Look, stupid fuck...
Hey.
You should join our club.
You and your friend.
Uhh!
No, I didn' t quite catch that, Lou.
Still not gettin 'it.
OK, OK, OK.
I got it.
I got it.
Shit, I lost it.
Ooh!
All of you!
Everybody back.
Aw, Lou...
Come on, man.
We really like this place.
Ohhh...
- That' s right, Lou, get it -- - Shut the fuck up!
Oh, yeah!
Ho ho, ho!
Fuckin 'guys are loony, I' m tellin' ya.
Unbelievable.
- Oh, my God!
- Ha ha ha!
You don' t know where I' ve been!
Please let us keep it, Lou!
Please, Lou!
Fuckin 'use the basement!
I want your word, Lou!
I want your word!
On my mother' s honor.
Thanks, Lou.
You, too, big guy.
See you next week.
This week... each one of you... has a homework assignment.
You' re gonna start a fight with a total stranger.
And you' re gonna lose.
Excellent choice, sir.
Watch out, jackass!
Come on!
Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.
Son of a bitch!
Most people... normal people... do just about anything to avoid a fight.
Excuse me.
You sprayed me with your hose.
That' s not necessary.
Dave!
Go call 911!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Sorry.
We need to talk.
[Door Closes]
Where to begin?
With your constant absenteeism?
With your unpresentable appearance?
You' re up for review.
I am Jack' s... complete lack of surprise.
What?
Let' s pretend.
OK?
Someone informs you that this company installs front seat mounting brackets that never pass collision tests... brake linings that fail after a thousand miles, and fuel injectors that explode and burn people alive.
What then?
Are you threatening me?
No...
Get the fuck outta here.
I have a better solution.
You keep me on the payroll as an outside consultant.
And in exchange for my salary, my job will be never to tell people these things that I know.
I can do this job from home.
Who -- Who the fuck do you think you are, you crazy little shit?
Security?
I am jack' s smirking revenge.
What the hell are you doing?
Ohh... that hurt.
Why would you do that?
Oh, my God.
No!
Please stop!
What are you doing?
Oh, God, no!
Please!
For some reason, I thought of my first fight with Tyler.
No!
Under and behind and inside, everything this man took for granted... something horrible had been growing.
Now, look.
Give me the paychecks like I asked, and you won' t ever see me again.
And right then, at our most excellent moment together...
Oh... thank God.
Telephone, computer, fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks, and 48 airline flight coupons.
We now had corporate sponsorship.
This is how Tyler and I were able to have Fight Club every night of the week.
Now nobody was the center of Fight Club except the 2 men fighting.
The leader walked through the crowd, out in the darkness.
Tyler was now involved in a class- action lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel over the urine content of their soup.
I am Jack' s wasted life.
There you are, sir.
Tyler dreamed up new homework assignments.
He handed them out in sealed envelopes.
Did you know there' s a Fight Club up in Delaware City?
Yeah, I heard.
There' s one in Penn' s Grove, too.
Bob even found one up in Newcastle.
Did you start that one?
I thought you did.
Nah.
Stop for a second.
Hey, what are we doing?
Turn around.
What are we doing?
Homework assignment.
Human sacrifice.
Hey, is that a gun?
Please tell me that' s not a gun.
It' s a gun.
What are you doing?
Meet me in the back.
Hey, don' t fuck around.
Meet me in the back.
On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.
What are you doing?
Hands behind your back.
Give me your wallet.
Raymond K. Hessel, 1320 Southeast Banning, apartment A.
Small, cramped basement apartment, Raymond?
How did you know?
letters instead of numbers.
Raymond... you' re going to die.
Oh, my God, no...
Is that your mom and dad?
Mom and dad are going to have to call up kindly Dr. So- And- So to pick up your dental records.
You want to know why?
Because there' s going to be nothing left of your face.
- Aw, come on.
An expired community college student I. D.
What' d you study, Raymond?
S- S- S- Stuff.
Stuff?
Were the midterms hard?
I asked you what you studied.
Biology, mostly.
Why?
I -- I don' t know.
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
The question, Raymond, was what did you want to be?
Jesus!
Veterinarian!
Veterinarian!
Animals.
Yeah, animal s- s- s --
Stuff.
Yeah, I got that.
That means you have to get more schooling.
Too much school.
Would you rather be dead?
No...
Would you rather die, here, on your knees, in the back of a convenience store?
No...
I' m keeping your license.
Gonna check in on you.
I know where you live.
If you' re not on your way to becoming a veterinarian in 6 weeks, you will be dead.
Now run on home.
Run, Forrest, run!
I feel ill.
Imagine how he feels.
Come on, this isn' t funny!
What the fuck was the point of that?
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K. Hessel' s life.
His breakfast will taste better than any meal you and I have ever tasted.
You had to give it to him.
Come on.
He had a plan.
And it started to make sense in a Tyler sort of way.
No fear.
The ability to let that which does not matter truly slide.
You' re not your job.
You' re not how much money you have in the bank.
You' re not the car you drive.
You' re not the contents of your wallet.
You' re not your fuckin 'khakis.
You' re the all- singing, all- dancing crap of the world.
I' il be out of your way in a sec.
You don' t have to go.
Whatever.
No, I mean, uh...
It' s OK.
Are you still going to groups?
Yeah.
Chloe' s dead.
Ah, Chloe.
When did that happen?
Do you care?
I don' t know.
I haven' t thought about it in a while.
Yeah, well...
I think it was a smart move on her part.
Hey, listen, uh... what are you getting out of all this?
What?
I mean, all this.
Why do you keep...
Is this making you happy?
Yeah, well, sometimes.
I don' t know.
I don' t understand.
Why does a weaker person need to latch on to a strong person?
What is that?
Well, what do you get out of it?
No -- It' s -- It' s not the same thing at all.
It' s totally different with us.
Us?
What do you mean by "us"?
I' m sorry, do you hear this?
Hear what?
You' re not hearing all that noise? just -- Hold on a second.
What were you saying?
I want to talk about this.
You' re not talking about me, are you?
No.
What?
That day you came over to my place to play doctor -- what was going on there?
Nothing.
Nothing.
I don' t think so.
Come on, what do you want?
- Look at me.
What?
Look at me.
What is that?
It' s nothing.
Don' t worry about it.
Who did this?
A person.
Guy or girl?
What do you care if it' s a guy or a girl?
This is none of your business.
You' re afraid to say it.
I am not afraid to say.
No!
Talk to me.
Leave me alone.
This conversation...
This conversation... is over. is over.
I just can' t win with you, can I?
Hey, this is getting a little old.
[Doorbell]
What is -- What is all this?
What do you think?
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?
Too young.
Sorry.
What' s all that?
If the applicant is young, tell him he' s too young.
Applicant?
If the applicant then waits for 3 days without food, shelter or encouragement, he may then enter and begin his training.
Training for what?
You think this is a game?
End of story.
Quit wasting our time.
Get the fuck out of here.
Bad news, friend.
It' s not gonna happen.
I' m sorry if there was a misunderstanding.
It' s not the end of the world. just go away.
Go.
You' re trespassing, and I will have to call the police.
Don' t you look at me.
You' re never getting in this fucking house.
Never.
Now get the fuck off the porch.
Get off the porch!
Sooner or later, we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.
I' m gonna go inside and I' m gonna get a shovel.
You got 2 black shirts?
Sir.
2 pair of black pants?
Yes, sir.
One pair of black boots?
Sir.
2 pair of black socks?
Sir.
One black jacket?
Sir. $300 personal burial money?
Yes, sir.
All right.
You' re too old, fat man.
Your tits are too big.
Bob.
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.
Space monkey.
Ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good.
You are too fucking old, fatty!
You' re too fucking... blond!
Get out of here, the both of you!
Narrator:
Listen up, maggots.
You are not special.
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.
You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else.
Tyler built himself an army.
We are the all- singing, all- dancing crap of the world.
We are all part of the same compost heap.
Why was Tyler Durden building an army?
To what purpose?
For what greater good?
In Tyler we trusted.
No, when he was like, "You are not your job," I was like...
Hey, what' s all this?
[Laughing]
OK!
Go on in and celebrate.
What are we celebrating?
Go on.
Hey.
Let me get that for you.
Investigators are on the scene right now.
Police Commissioner Jacobs has just arrived.
Commissioner, Commissioner, could you please tell us what you think has happened here?
We believe this is one of many recent acts of vandalism around the city somehow related to underground boxing clubs.
We' il be coordinating a rigorous investigation.
That was Police Commissioner Jacobs, who just arrived on the scene here of a 4- alarm fire that broke out about an hour ago.
Live from the Parker Morris Building,
Back to you in the studio.
- [Laughter]
- Ha ha ha ha!
Holy shit.
Yeah!
What the fuck did you guys do?
News Anchor:... how the blaze started, but arson investigators are on the premises...
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions, sir.
The victory in the war against crime will not come overnight.
It will take dedication and commitment, and most of all, cooperation.
The streets are safer now.
There is hope in the inner city.
However, this is only the beginning.
These are the first steps in a long journey.
That is why we have created Project Hope...
Project Hope will be a joint effort between the police and community leaders.
It will be a powerful new weapon in the war against crime.
Wrap it around the top of his hacky sack, Bob.
His balls are ice cold.
Hi.
You' re gonna call off your rigorous investigation.
You' re gonna publicly state that there is no underground group, or... these guys are gonna take your balls.
They' re gonna send one to the New York Times, one to the L. A. Times press release style.
Look... the people you are after are the people you depend on.
We cook your meals.
We connect your calls.
We drive your ambulances.
We guard you while you sleep.
Do not fuck with us.
Fooled ya.
[Dialogue Drowned Out By Noise]
Let' s go.
I am Jack' s inflamed sense of rejection.
Hey!
Yeah!
I felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every panda that wouldn' t screw to save its species.
I' d never see.
I wanted to breathe smoke.
Where' d you go, psycho boy?
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
Get him to a fuckin 'hospital.
Yeah.
Don' t worry, Mr. Durden.
Airport parking, long term.
After you, Mr. Durden.
After you.
Something on your mind, dear?
No.
Why wasn' t I told about Project Mayhem?
First rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions.
Why didn' t you include me in the beginning?
Fight Club was the beginning.
Now it' s moved out of the basement, it' s called Project Mayhem.
You and I started Fight Club together.
Do you remember that?
It' s as much mine as it is yours, you know.
Yeah.
I thought we were doing this together.
You' re missing the point.
This does not belong to us.
We are not special.
Fuck that.
You should' ve told me.
Hey, Tyler!
Goddamn it, Tyler!
What do you want?!
Statement of purpose?
Should I e- mail you?
Should I put this on your action item list?
You decide your own level of involvement!
I will!
I want to know certain things first.
The first rule of Project Mayhem --
Shut up!
Fuck what you know.
That' s your problem.
Forget about what you think you know about life, about friendship, and especially about you and me.
What...
What are you doing?
Guys, what do you wish you' d done before you die?
Paint a self- portrait.
Build a house.
And you?
I don' t know.
Get in the right lane.
I have to know the answer to this question.
If you were to die right now, how would you feel about your life?
I don' t know!
I wouldn' t feel anything good about my life.
Is that what you want to hear me say?
- Come on!
- [Honking]
- Stop fucking around!
Tyler!
Jesus Christ!
Goddamn it!
Goddamn it!
Fuck you!
Fuck Fight Club.
I' m sick of all your shit.
OK.
Quit screwing around.
Take the wheel.
Look at you.
Take the wheel!
You' re fuckin 'pathetic!
Why?
What are you talking about?
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
What?
Hitting bottom isn' t a weekend retreat.
It' s not a goddamn seminar.
Stop trying to control everything and just let go.
Let go!
All right.
Fine.
Fine.
I' d never been in a car accident.
This must have been what all those people felt like before I filed them as statistics in my reports.
Goddamn.
We just had a near- life experience.
In the world I see, you' re stalking elk through the damp canyon forest, around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.
You' il wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life.
You' il climb the vines that wrap the Sears Tower.
And when you look down, you' il see tiny figures pounding corn,
laying strips of venison on the empty carpool lane of some abandoned superhighway.
Feel better, champ.
And then...
Tyler was gone.
Was I asleep?
Had I slept?
You are not a beautiful unique snowflake, do you understand me?
Narrator:
The house had become a living thing, wet inside from so many people sweating and breathing.
So many people moving, the house moved.
Planet Tyler.
I had to hug the walls.
Trapped inside this clockwork of space monkeys.
You can' t be smoking in here.
Do you know how much ether we have in this fucking house?
Cooking, working, and sleeping in teams.
Hang on a second.
It' s under control, sir.
Where is Tyler?
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not --
Right, uh...
I' m all alone.
My father dumped me.
Tyler dumped me.
I am Jack' s broken heart.
What comes next in Project Mayhem, only Tyler knows.
The second rule is you do not ask questions.
Get the fuck away from me.
Get the fuck away from me!
Who are all these people?
Paper Street Soap Company.
Can I come in?
He' s not here.
What?
Tyler isn' t here.
Tyler went away.
Tyler' s gone.
[Shouting]
Lay him down!
Clear some fucking room!
What happened?!
What happened?!
We were on assignment.
We were supposed to kill 2 birds with one stone.
Destroy a piece of corporate art...
and trash a franchise coffee bar.
We had it all worked out, sir.
It went smooth until...
Police!
Freeze!
Until what?
They shot Bob.
They shot him in the head.
Those fuckin 'pigs!
- Son of a --
Those motherfuckers!
You' re running around in ski masks, trying to blow things up.
What did you think was gonna happen?!
OK, quick, we gotta get rid of the evidence.
What?
Take him to the garden and bury him.
Come on, people!
Let' s go!
Hey, get the fuck off!.
What are you talking about?
This isn' t a fucking piece of evidence, this is a person!
He' s a friend of mine, and you' re not gonna bury him in the fucking garden.
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.
This is Bob.
But sir, in -- in Project Mayhem we have no names.
And it' s Robert Paulson, OK?
Robert Paulson?
He' s a man and he' s dead now because of us, all right?
I understand.
In death, a member of Project Mayhem has a name.
His name is Robert Paulson.
His name is Robert Paulson.
His name is Robert Paulson.
His name is Robert Paulson.
Come on, guys, please, stop it.
His name is Robert Paulson.
Shut up!
This is all over with!
His name is Robert Paulson.
[Telephone Rings]
No, this is Detective Stern at the Arson Unit.
I need to see you in my office --
I went to all the cities on Tyler' s used ticket stubs, barhopping.
I didn' t know how or why, but I could look at 50 different bars and somehow I just knew.
It' s very important that I talk to him.
Sir.
I knew a Fight Club was close.
Hey!
Taxi!
Look at my face.
I' m a member.
Now, I just need to know if you' ve seen Tyler.
I' m not exposed to... speak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want at this juncture, be able.
I' m afraid I' m gonna have to ask you to leave.
Setting up franchises all over the country.
Was I asleep?
Had I slept?
Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler' s?
What kind of stories?
Like, nobody knows what he looks like.
He has facial reconstructive surgery every 3 years.
That' s the stupidest thing I' ve ever heard.
Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?
Is Mr. Durden building an army?
I was living in a state of perpetual déjà vu.
I felt I' d already been there.
It was like following an invisible man.
The smell of dried blood, dirty, bare footprints circling each other, that aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.
The feel of a floor still warm from the fight the night before.
I was always just one step behind Tyler.
His name is Robert Paulson.
Welcome back, sir.
How have you been?
Do you know me?
Is this a test, sir?
No, this is not a test.
You were in here last Thursday.
You were standing exactly where you are now, asking how good security is.
It' s tight as a drum, sir.
Who do you think I am?
Are you sure this isn' t a test?
No, this is not a test.
You' re Mr. Durden.
You' re the one who gave me this.
Please return your seat backs to their full, upright and locked position.
[Rings]
Marla, it' s me.
Have we ever done it?
Done what?
Have we ever had sex?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Is it stupid because the answer' s yes, or because the answer' s no?
Is this a trick?
No, Marla, I need to know --
You mean you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
We did make love.
Is that what you' re calling it? just answer the question,
Marla, please!
Did we do it or not?
You fuck me, then snub me.
You show me a sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole.
Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
We have just lost cabin pressure.
What is wrong with you?
What did you call me?
Tyler Durden.
Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.
What' s going on?
I' m coming over.
No, wait, Marla, I' m not there --
You broke your promise.
You fuckin 'talked to her about me.
Tyler, what the fuck is going on here?
I asked you for one thing, one simple thing.
Why do people think that I' m you?
Answer me!
Sit.
Now answer me.
Why do people think that I' m you?
I think you know.
No, I don' t.
Yes, you do.
Why would anyone possibly confuse you with me?
I...
You got it.
No.
Do not fuck with us.
Say it.
Because...
Say it.
Because we' re the same person.
That' s right.
We are the all- singing, all dancing --
I don' t understand this.
You were looking for a way to change your life.
You could not do this on your own.
All the ways you wish you could be, that' s me.
I look like you wanna look,
I fuck like you wanna fuck,
I am smart, capable, and most importantly, I am free in all the ways that you are not.
Oh, no.
Tyler' s not here.
Tyler went away.
- What?
This is impossible.
- No.
People do it every day.
They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they' d like to be.
They don' t have the courage you have, to just run with it.
Naturally, you' re still wrestling with it, so sometimes you' re still you.
We should do this again sometime.
Other times, you imagine yourself watching me.
If this is your first night at Fight Club, you have to fight.
Little by little, you' re just letting yourself become...
Tyler Durden.
You are not your job, or how much money you have in the bank!
No, you have a house.
Rented in your name.
You have jobs, you have a whole life.
You have night jobs because you can' t sleep.
Or you stay up and make soap.
Marla -- You' re fucking Marla, Tyler.
Uh, technically, you' re fucking Marla.
But it' s all the same to her.
Oh, my God.
Now you see our dilemma.
She knows too much.
I think we' re going to have to talk about how this might compromise our goals.
Wh -- What are you saying?
This is -- This is bullshit.
I' m not listening to this.
You are insane.
No, you' re insane.
And we simply do not have time for this crap.
It' s called a changeover.
The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
Woman:
Sir!
Are you checking out?
Yeah, uh, b- bill me.
I need you to initial this list of phone calls, please.
When were these made?
It says right there, sir, between 2: 00 and 3: 30 this morning.
Have I been sleeping later?
Have I been Tyler longer and longer?
Is anybody here?
Déjà vu all over again.
Yeah, with enough soap, we could blow up just about anything.
Oh, my God.
1888.
I' m sorry, who am I calling?
This is Maintenance.
Hello?
Yes.
Can I help you?
Hello?
Uh, I need to talk to your supervisor right away.
Speaking.
OK, listen to me.
You have got --
It' s under control, sir.
Excuse me?
Don' t worry about us, sir.
2160.
Marla!
Marla!
Hey -- Fuck!
Wait, I gotta talk to you!
Marla, Marla!
Your whacked- out bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom!
They almost broke my arm!
They were burning their fingertips with lye, the stink was unbelievable.
Look -- Look, listen, it' s gonna take a tremendous act of faith on your part, but you' ve got to hear me out.
Oh, here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
A little more faith than that.
No, listen, I don' t want to hear anything you have to say.
You have every right to be...
Um, I' il just have a coffee, thanks.
Sir, anything you order is free of charge, sir.
Why is it free of charge?
Don' t -- Don' t ask.
Whatever.
I' il have the clam chowder, the fried chicken with the baked potato with everything, and a chocolate chiffon pie.
Clean food, please.
In that case, sir, may I advise against the lady eating the clam chowder?
No clam chowder, thank you.
You' ve got about 30 seconds.
Marla, I know that I' ve been acting very, very strange.
OK, I know that it' s got to seem
like there' s 2 sides to me -- 2 sides?
You' re Dr. Jekyil and Mr. Jackass.
I deserve that, but --
I' ve come to realize something very, very important.
What?
The full extent of our relationship wasn' t really clear to me up until now, for reasons I' m not going to go into, but the important thing is, I know that I haven' t been treating you so nice.
Yeah, whatever.
15 seconds, please, please.
15 seconds, don' t open your mouth.
I' m trying to tell you that I' m sorry.
Because what I' ve come to realize is that I really like you, Marla.
You do?
I really do.
I care about you and I don' t want anything bad to happen to you because of me.
Marla, your life is in danger.
What?
You need to leave town for a while.
Get out of any major city and just go camping or something.
You' re an insane person.
No, no, I' ve involved you in something terrible that' s about to happen.
No.
Shut up, shut up!
I really tried.
I know you did.
There are things about you I like.
You' re smart, you' re funny, you' re spectacular in bed.
But you' re intolerable.
You have very serious emotional problems.
Deep- seated problems for which you should seek professional help.
I know, and I' m sorry.
Yeah, you' re sorry, I' m sorry, everyone' s sorry.
But...
I can' t do this anymore.
I can' t.
And I won' t.
I' m gone.
You can' t leave, Marla, you' re not safe!
No!
Marla, I' m trying to protect you.
I don' t ever want to see you again!
That' s fine, if that' s what it takes...
Wait right here.
- [Honking]
- Shut up!
Shut up!
Take this money and get on this bus.
And I promise you
- [Honks]
- Shut up!
Please get on the bus!
Why are you doing this?
Because they think you' re some kind of a threat.
I -- I can' t explain it right now, just trust me.
I' m not paying this back.
I consider it asshole tax.
That' s fine.
Remember, stay out of major cities for at least a couple of days, OK?
Tyler.
You' re the worst thing that ever happened to me.
Hello.
I need you to arrest me.
I am the leader of a terrorist organization responsible for numerous acts of vandalism, and assault all over this city.
... in the metropolitan area, with probably a couple hundred members.
Chapters have sprung up in 5 or 6 other major cities already.
This is a tightly regimented organization, with many cells capable of operating completely independent of central leadership.
Look, look, go to that house, OK?
1537 Paper Street.
That' s our headquarters.
In the back, buried in the garden, you' il find the body of Robert Paulson.
In the basement, you' re gonna find some bathtubs that have been used very recently to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.
I believe the plan is to blow up the headquarters of these credit card companies, and the T. R. W. building.
Why these buildings?
Why credit card companies?
If you erase the debt record, then we all go back to zero.
It' il create total chaos.
Keep him talking.
I need to make a phone call.
I really admire what you' re doing.
What?
You' re a brave man to order this.
You' re a genius, sir.
You said, if anyone ever interferes with Project Mayhem -- even you -- we gotta get his balls.
It' s useless to fight.
This is really a powerful gesture,
Mr. Durden.
It' il set quite an example.
You' re making a big mistake, fellas.
You said you' d say that.
I' m not Tyler Durden!
You told us you' d say that, too.
All right, I am Tyler Durden.
I' m giving you a direct order.
We are aborting this mission, right now.
You said you would definitely say that.
You' re police officers!
Somebody timing this?
Keep your mouth shut!
Shit.
Hey, you know, some of this information checks out.
Let' s go over to that house on Paper Street.
Hey!
I got him.
Sir, we have to do this, sir.
Stop fighting.
Where' s the rubber band?
Get away from me!
Drop that fucking knife!
Back up.
Face down on the floor, both of you, right now!
Get down on the floor!
First person comes out this fucking door gets a -- gets a lead salad, you understand?
Get away!
Get away!
I ran.
I ran until my muscles burned and my veins pumped battery acid.
Then I ran some more.
What the fuck are you doing?
Running around in your underpants.
Man, you look like a crazy person.
No, I' m onto you.
I know what' s going on here.
Well come on, then.
[Grunting]
It' il be like pay- per- view.
Oh, Christ.
I' m stopping this.
Why?
Greatest thing you' ve ever done, man.
No, I can' t let this happen.
You know there are 10 other bombs in 10 other buildings.
God damn it, since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
The buildings are empty.
Security and maintenance, all our people.
We' re not killing anyone, man, we' re setting 'em free.
They shot him in the head.
You wanna make an omelet, you gotta break some eggs.
No, I' m not listening to you.
You' re not even there.
Wouldn' t do that.
Not unless I knew which wires were what.
If you know, then I know.
Or... maybe I knew you' d know, so I spent the whole day thinking about the wrong ones.
You think?
Oh, heavens no, not the green one.
Pull any one but the green one.
I asked you not to do that!
Tyler, get away from the van.
Tyler, I' m not kidding!
Get away from the van!
God damn it!
Whoa!
Whoa!
OK, you are now firing a gun at your imaginary friend near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!
Look, Tyler, Tyler!
Aw, come on.
Don' t go.
What?!
3 minutes.
This is it.
The beginning.
Ground zero.
I think this is about where we came in.
Would you like to say a few words to mark the occasion?
I' m sorry?
I still can' t think of anything.
Ah, flashback humor.
It' s getting exciting now.
2 and 1/ 2.
Think of everything we' ve accomplished, man.
Out these windows, we will view the collapse of financial history.
One step closer to economic equilibrium.
Tying up loose ends.
Put me down, you bald- headed fucks!
I' m begging you, please don' t do this.
I' m not doing this.
We are doing this.
This is what we want.
No, I don' t want this.
Right, except you is meaningless now.
We have to forget about you.
Jesus, you' re a voice in my head.
You' re a voice in mine.
You' re a fucking hallucination, why can' t I get rid of you?
You need me.
No, I don' t, I really don' t anymore.
Hey, you created me.
I didn' t create some loser alter ego to make myself feel better.
Take some responsibility.
I do.
I am responsible for all of it, and I accept that.
So please, I' m begging you, please call this off.
Have I ever let us down?
How far have you come because of me?
I will carry you, kicking and screaming, and in the end, you will thank me.
Tyler.
Tyler, I' m grateful to you for everything that you' ve done for me.
But this is too much.
I don' t want this.
What do you want?!
Want to go back to the shit job, fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?
Fuck you.
I won' t do it.
Oh, God, this can' t be happening.
It' s already done, so shut up.
60 seconds.
Can you see alright?
I can figure this out.
I can figure this out, this isn' t even real.
You' re not real, that gun isn' t --
That gun isn' t even in your hand.
The gun' s in my hand.
Doesn' t change a thing.
Why do you want to put a gun to your head?
Not my head, Tyler.
Our head.
Interesting.
Where are you going with this, IKEA boy?
Hey, it' s you and me.
Friends.
Tyler...
I want you to really listen to me.
OK.
My eyes are open.
What' s that smell?
Where is everybody?
I don' t know, what' s goin 'on?
Mr. Durden!
Oh, my God.
Are you, uh...
Are you alright, sir?
Oh, yeah, I' m OK.
You look terrible, sir.
What happened?
Oh, nothing.
It' s no problem.
Oh, no, no, sir, he' s not kidding.
You look really awful.
You need medical assistance.
- I' m fine.
Look, I' m fine.
Everything' s fine.
[Marla Shouting]
Let -- Let her go.
Christ almighty!
You!
Hi, Marla.
Leave her with me, get your stuff,
Are you sure?
Yes, I' m sure.
You fucker!
What kind of sick fucking game are you playing now, putting me on a fucking bu --
Oh, my God, your face!
Yeah, I know.
What happened?
Don' t ask.
You' re shot.
Yes, I' m shot.
Oh, my God.
I can' t believe he' s standing.
One tough motherfucker.
Who did this?
I did, actually.
Find some gauze.
You shot yourself?
Yes, but it' s OK.
Marla, look at me.
I' m really OK.
Trust me.
Everything' s gonna be fine.
You met me at a very strange time in my life.
You know the problem with Hollywood?
They make shit.
Unbelievable, unremarkable shit.
I' m not some wannabe filmmaker...... searching for existentialism through a haze of bong smoke.
No, it' s easy to pick apart bad acting, shortsighted directing...... and a moronic stringing- together of words the studios term as prose.
Not a pervasive element in modern American cinematic vision.
Take Dog Day Afternoon, for example.
Arguably Pacino' s best work.
Short of Scarface and Godfather Part I, of course.
Masterpiece of directing, easily Lumet' s best.
The cinematography, the acting, the screenplay, all topnotch.
But...
... they didn' t push the envelope.
What if, in Dog Day, Sonny wanted to get away with it?
Really wanted that.
Now this is the tricky part.
What if he started killing hostages right away?
No mercy, no quarter.
"Bam, splat.
What, still no bus?
Come on.
How many innocent victims would it take for the city...... to reverse its policy on hostages?
There' s no CNN.
There' s no CNBC.
There' s no Internet.
Fast- forward to today.
Present time, same situation.
How quickly would the media make a frenzy?
In hours.
It would be the biggest story from Boston to Budapest.
Ten hostages die.
Twenty, thirty.
Relentless.
Bam, bim.
One after another.
All on hi- def, computer- enhanced.
You can almost taste the brain matter.
All for what?
A bus, a plane?
A couple million dollars that' s federally insured?
I don' t think so, but...... just a thought.
I mean, it' s not...... within the realm of conventional cinema, but...... what if?
- There' s a problem with that movie.
- Really?
- It wouldn' t work.
- How come?
- Audiences love happy endings.
- Pacino escapes with the money.
Boyfriend gets a sex change.
Live happily ever after.
- No?
- No.
Homophobia.
Bad guy can' t win.
It' s a morality tale.
One way or the other, he' s gotta go down.
Well, life is stranger than fiction sometimes.
You know, guys, I gotta go.
Gotta jet.
Thanks for the coffee.
Stan.
Time to go to work.
You coming?
Move.
I won' t say it again.
I have a clear shot.
Shooters, stand by.
Okay.
Now what?
Don' t worry, folks, it' s almost over.
Is she done?
- She' s done.
- Move her out.
Don' t worry, you' il be fine.
You' il be back before you know it.
Turn the fuck around.
Rescue team, let' s go.
Who' s on the roof?
All shooters, you are holding for command.
You' re doing good.
Behave yourself.
Look over there, and there.
All prepare their shot.
- What are you doing?
- I' m handling this!
Don' t fuck with this guy!
You' il get these people killed!
We got two teams on the roof.
We got a team over there.
Double this team up.
That' s your best angle.
Don' t talk.
Just listen.
Each of the 22 hostages is wrapped with 20 pounds of C- 4 explosives.
They' re also taped with 15 pounds of stainless- steel ball bearings.
Which makes them the world' s largest claymore mines.
They got the green light.
I got this guy on the phone!
I' m done playing with this asshole!
Around their necks are radio- frequency electronic dog collars.
Same here.
This bank is their yard, so don' t fuck with me.
Johnson, you and your partner move up between those vehicles.
- Stand down!
- Get back!
- Get back!
- Officer, stand down now!
He' s gonna shoot!
He' s gonna shoot!
Shit.
Get her!
Go!
No!
Release the hostage!
No!
Release the hostage!
She' s gone.
Take cover!
No, no!
Let her go!
Let her go!
Release the hostage!
Help me!
Let her go.
Let her go!
- Jesus.
- Shit!
You guys, come on!
- How long will you be here?
- One week.
- Business or pleasure?
- Hopefully both.
- What type of work do you do?
- I' m a consultant.
Excuse me.
Could you be careful with that?
That' s expensive equipment.
- How long will this take?
- A few minutes.
Sit down, relax.
I' il be right back.
A few minutes, huh?
Hey, where' s he going?
Stairs.
Sir, could you please --?
Easy, easy.
This better be important.
Wouldn' t have asked you otherwise, senator.
We just received word that Axl Torvalds was intercepted entering the U. S.
- When was this?
- Within the last two hours.
According to my FBI source, he was nabbed in customs at LAX.
- They know he' s working for us?
- It' s unlikely.
It was a routine check.
Torvalds freaked out.
They got lucky.
This ain' t good.
What do the feds know?
Nothing yet.
He' s refusing to speak English.
The Finnish consulate has contacted the State Department.
- So we haven' t been compromised?
- I' m not sure.
I' m working on that.
You better get sure because someone' s cock will end up on the block...... and it won' t be mine.
I understand, senator.
There you go.
Well, well, well.
Who are you supposed to be?
- I' m Ginger.
- Ginger, huh?
Where' s Gilligan?
For someone the NSA once listed as the most dangerous hacker in America...... you sure don' t look like much.
Surprised?
I know everything about you, Stan.
What are you selling again?
My employer wants to meet you.
- Shit.
- You' re not too good at golf.
You' re fucking up my chi.
Let me have that.
This is not a nice place you got here, Stan.
Here 5 minutes, and I already feel sorry for myself.
You' re wasting your time.
I touch a computer, I go back to Leavenworth.
Do not pass Go, do not collect $200.
If I knew you were coming, I might have cleaned up.
I' m not here to suck your dick, Stanley.
He' il pay you just to meet you.
I gotta go to work.
Right.
Great work greasing pump jacks.
So...... spoke to Holly lately?
Shit!
Hello?
Melissa.
Is Holly home?
Why are you calling here?
- I just want to talk with Holly.
- It' s Saturday.
She' s at soccer.
It' s illegal for you to talk to her.
Don' t do this, Mel.
It' s not good for Holly.
How would you know what' s good for my daughter?
You spent the last two years in prison.
- Mel.
- Stop calling me that, Stanley.
Look, I just....
I just want to see my baby.
Well, she doesn' t want to see you, Stanley.
And I swear, if you try to contact her...... I' il have you thrown in a hole so dark...... Leavenworth will seem like two weeks in Vegas...... during which I will personally...... pay two skinheads to make a playground out of your ass.
You can take the girl out of the trailer park...... but can' t take the trailer park out of the girl.
I will not let myself be manipulated by you, Stanley.
Larry' s her father now.
Larry' s the porn king of Southern Calif --
Larry is a film financier.
The films he chooses are for profit and none of your business.
Get help.
Get into a program, get a therapist, get a dog.
But whatever you do, stay away from my child.
- Your child?
She' s our child.
- She will never be your child.
Forget Holly.
What are you still doing here?
Look, I' m beginning to lose my sense of humor.
Then I' il cut to the chase.
If you want your daughter back, you better listen up.
Unless you want to stay here in this loser existence...... while your daughter grows up to be a fluffer in her new daddy' s videos.
Please don' t confuse your own childhood with my daughter' s.
And look at your situation, Stanley.
For the past 20 months, you' ve been in and out of court 6 times?
Each time your case was thrown out.
Situation doesn' t look good, sweetheart.
How much money would it cost to hire the best family lawyer in the country?
Come here.
Come here.
Judas.
That should get you started.
Hundred grand.
What do you got to lose?
He just wants to meet you.
One time.
You don' t like the situation...... walk away.
- And that' s it?
- That' s it.
And you keep the money.
What did he say?
All right, look, look.
Your client is wanted on 24 counts of electronic crimes...... in 7 different countries.
He has a Finnish passport.
These allegations are not recognized as crimes.
Your laws don' t apply.
Do you see a Finnish flag hanging on the wall, IKEA boy?
- What did he say?
- He said IKEA is Swedish.
He understands English, huh?
- Let me talk to him.
- He' s all yours.
You' re fucked up now, Hamlet.
The thing is, they have you put the furniture together yourself.
My client has reserved his right not to answer any questions.
Why would the best hacker in the world...... risk life imprisonment by coming into the continental U. S.?
Okay, what did he just say?
He never misses an episode of Survivor.
Did he really say that?
You' re funny.
- How much do you weigh?
- How much do I weigh?
We' il call you if we need you.
Eat a dick.
Wipe that smile off your face.
A year ago, I was head of the largest cyber- criminal task force in the world.
But I burned out.
I snapped.
I shot a suspect in the hand.
You know how difficult it is to work a keyboard with one hand?
You don' t understand.
Whatever you want to do to me, he' il do worse.
I' m already dead.
My only chance is back in Europe.
I have friends there.
Tell me what I want to know.
First class.
Courtesy of the U. S. government.
Who is he?
- I don' t know his name.
- You work for him.
You don' t know?
Tell me something.
I' il tell you what I know.
He exists in a world beyond your world.
What we only fantasize, he does.
He lives a life where nothing is beyond him.
But you know what?
It' s all a façade.
For all his charm and charisma, his wealth, his expensive toys...... he is a driven, unflinching, calculating machine.
He takes what he wants, when he wants...... and disappears.
So how do I find him?
You don' t find him.
He finds you.
Here' s how it works.
His people pick me up.
Take me to him.
He tells me what he wants me to do.
I do the job right there.
I get paid, and I leave.
That' s a really nice story, but you haven' t told me shit, have you?
- Excuse me, sir.
You have a call.
- Take a message.
It' s assistant director Joy.
He said it' s important.
I can only tell you what I' ve done for him.
Well, that' s a start.
Thank you.
You' ve just let my client go free.
- You denied his right to counsel -- - Excuse me.
Yeah, and you eat the dick!
Yes, I got a call from A. D. Joy.
This is Roberts.
Hold for just one moment, sir.
- Joy.
- Yeah, Roberts.
You needed me.
You didn' t call?
No, Roberts.
What do you want?
You should' ve let me buy you a suit, Stanley.
I' m happy with what I' m wearing.
Ignorance is bliss.
Miss me?
- Stanley, Gabriel.
- Big Stan.
- Nice suit.
- Thanks.
- They say the clothes make the man.
- You buy it?
Hope not.
Drink?
I flew 1500 miles for this meeting.
How about we get to the point?
No.
Actually, you flew 1500 miles for 100 grand.
But that' s not the point.
Meet Stanley.
- Hello, Stanley.
- Helga.
Look, I don' t have a lot of patience, Gabriel.
Maybe you can help me with something.
Take a look at this.
You know I can' t touch that.
Do you like tequila, Stanley?
This is bullshit.
You want something from me, and I from you.
DOD d- base, 128- bit encryption.
What do you think?
- Impossible?
- Nothing' s impossible.
Good.
Maybe slide in a Trojan horse hiding a worm?
- Is this an interview?
- Sort of.
Marco.
Give him some incentive.
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Relax, Stanley.
I have been told that the best crackers in the world...... can do this in 60 minutes.
Unfortunately, I need someone to do it in 60 seconds.
You' re kidding.
Afraid not.
Get up, get up!
- Fifty- five.
- Get on with it.
- What the hell is this?
- Time' s a- wasting, big guy.
Oh, Jesus.
Forty- five seconds.
Oh, she' s good, isn' t she?
What' s going on here?
Jesus Christ.
- More time, more time!
- Come on, Stan!
Twenty.
Nineteen.
Fifteen.
Come on.
Ten.
Nine.
Three.
Two.
One.
- Too bad.
You gotta die.
- No, wait!
I was just fucking with you, Stan.
That' s our guy.
- Get away from me.
- I really want to help you, Stan.
Like you helped me in there?
- That was a test, Stan.
- A test.
And you passed.
I don' t know why I let you talk me into this.
You' re saving your daughter.
I' d do anything for her, but if I end up in a box or in jail...... then I really can' t help her.
I' m taking my money and going back to court!
With your little $100, 000?
Melissa will throw $500, 000 back at you.
Think!
I' m thinking that you' il put a gun to my head just to see if I can --
I can' t pee in front of an audience.
Let me break it down to you, Stanley, one last time.
You live in a trailer.
You' re a felon.
You work a dead- end job.
And you desperately want your daughter back.
Gabriel is your only shot.
Take it.
- I' m concerned about our new friend.
- Oh, now, don' t be jealous.
I don' t see him dragging his sorry ass over the finish line.
- Thought we lost you.
- Tell me what the deal is.
The deal is that we' re having a little gathering at the house.
Come and I' il explain it to you there.
Gentlemen, if it' s not good news, don' t say it.
Actually, we have a ray of hope in the darkness of your life.
When we grabbed Torvalds at the airport, these two guys were there.
Check this out.
Recognize those two same guys, a few hours later.
And then...... guess who shows up.
Stanley Jobson.
Wired magazine' s 1996 Man of the Year.
A burnout now, but the hacker Zeitgeist then.
Yeah, I know Jobson, I arrested him.
Why are you in L. A., Stan?
His ex- wife and daughter live in Malibu.
The new husband owns Backdoor Films, a shady porn production house.
The production value' s good, considering that they shoot on video.
- I know.
She' s like an actress.
That' s great.
Are you done?
Who' s the girl?
Actually, sir, we don' t know yet.
- She' s a serious piece of talent.
- Man, she' s way out of his league.
Find out who she is.
- Sit on the ex- wife' s house.
- You got it.
Stanley, you want to get wet?
- I don' t have a suit.
- You don' t need one.
- Come on, Stan.
- Later.
- Some view.
Let' s get a drink.
- Pool lights on.
- So how did you do it?
- Do what?
Break the code.
I dropped a logic bomb through the trapdoor.
No, you didn' t.
You didn' t have time.
- What' il you have?
- Scotch.
- You can do better than that.
- I used a password sniffer.
How did you do it?
I don' t know exactly.
I see the code in my head.
I can' t explain it.
Let me show you something.
Pretty impressive, huh?
So, what we need from you is a worm.
A hydra, actually.
A multiheaded worm to sniff out digital footprints across an encrypted network.
- What kind of cipher?
- A Vernam encryption.
The key code is destroyed upon implementation.
And it' s a true 128- bit encryption.
Well, actually, we' re talking a 512- bit.
- That' s definitely not possible.
- What if I give you 10 million dollars?
That would cover all your problems.
Yes?
Unless, of course, it' s not possible.
But you think about it.
It won' t bite you.
I promise.
This is not just a multi- screen system.
It has a DS- 3 connection.
We can access 7 different networks simultaneously.
It has a central encryption you have to crack to utilize the system.
Try it.
It' il be hard without a gun to my head.
Maybe I should put a gun to your head.
I thought you were Gabriel' s.
- I' m not what you think I am.
- Ginger.
You surprised that a girl with an IQ over 70 can give you a hard- on?
So is it impossible?
Nothing' s impossible.
Good.
So we have a deal.
- Morning.
- You mean afternoon?
Can I borrow your car for something?
Sure.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Hey, Stan, if you' re going to see Holly...... I suggest you re- evaluate the way you look.
Just a thought.
Just a thought.
Come on, Mom, pick up.
- Mom late again?
- She' il be here in a minute.
Hi.
Can I have the phone number for Yellow Cab?
Need a lift?
Daddy!
Oh, what are you doing here?
- I missed you so much.
- Oh, I missed you too, baby.
- I brought you something.
- Oh, my gosh.
It' s so cute.
Oh, Dad.
If Mom finds out, she' il have you thrown in jail.
It' s okay, baby.
You want a lift home?
- Of course I do.
- Come here.
All right.
You are heavy.
- Nice car.
- Hey, thanks.
Is that Mommy' s car?
Is she home?
That' s my stepdad' s car.
So listen to me.
I found a way for us to be together.
I don' t want anything to happen to you.
Everything' s going to be fine.
Everything' s going to be okay.
Just trust me.
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you.
Come here.
Oh, God.
You go home.
Okay?
Bye.
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.
Go.
Oh, sweetheart.
Hey.
Come here.
It' s okay.
Go.
Go.
Who the hell are you?
- A friend of a friend.
- Shit.
Oh, fuck.
Fuck!
Hold it!
Stanley!
Go!
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck!
Don' t move!
Don' t move.
Come here.
Look at this.
What were you running for?
You arresting me?
For violating your parole by leaving Texas without permission?
Or evading an officer and almost getting me killed in the process?!
No, I' m not arresting you.
Then why are we talking?
- What are you doing in L. A.?
- Vacationing.
Vacationing, right.
The judge is allowing you to see your daughter?
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you?
Oh?
You just want to get right down to it?
Okay, fine.
I can help you with your daughter.
You help me, I' il help you.
The fact that...... you put me in jail doesn' t inspire trust.
You put a virus in an FBI program and set it back two years.
They were reading ISP subscribers' e- mail.
It was illegal.
- I did what the judges wouldn' t do!
- You broke the law!
We both did what we had to do.
And your program is back in full swing.
Nice trip down memory lane, but if you aren' t arresting me --
Not getting a lot of cooperation here.
I ran into your friend Torvalds the other day.
He was vacationing too.
What are the odds of you being in L. A. at the same time?
I' m just a sucker for Disneyland.
We done?
Good.
Tell Torvalds I said hello.
You can tell him yourself if you' re not careful.
He' s dead.
Give me a card.
You think of anything to say, call me.
Sorry about your nose.
- You' re in way over your head.
- I know.
- You want me to watch him?
- Yeah, set it up.
I' ve had a shitty day so far, but I think it just got worse.
Either shoot me, or tell me why you' re wearing that wire.
Can' t do that.
Who are you, Ginger?
I can' t tell you.
Who are you?
He' il kill me if he finds out.
That' s not my problem, is it?
You' re asking for a lot of faith without giving me any.
You brought me into this mess.
I deserve to know who' s playing me.
Who are you?
I' m DEA, Stanley.
Holy shit.
We' re after Gabriel.
Give him the worm...... take the money and get out of here.
That' s all.
This looks friendly.
You know me, I' m a friendly girl.
Come on, Stanley.
Let' s get coffee.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Ever heard of Operation Swordfish?
- No.
Then you' il appreciate the irony.
Triple espresso.
- Two.
- Okay.
In the '80s, the DEA set up a network of dummy corporations...... as a front to launder drug money and gather evidence.
But these companies started to make a lot of money.
In 1986, when it was terminated, $400 million was in these accounts.
Money that just sort of disappeared.
It didn' t disappear.
It sat, earning interest.
That' s 15 years ago.
You know how much money that is today?
Nine and a half billion.
This is a sweet deal.
We go in over the phone lines, pop the firewall...... drop in the hydra and wait for the money.
Aren' t you getting ahead of yourself?
To access the cluster, you need a bank on the backbone of the network.
- Know how long that' il take to find?
- Not a problem.
Look behind you.
Cheers.
These fellows might wear Armani...... but they have the swagger of ex- military.
Maybe bodyguards, but they look like mercs to me.
Something' s going on.
They have two DS- 3 trucks.
That' s serious bandwidth.
Thermal scopes show a huge heat load.
Could be mainframes.
The house was listed by Celebrity Estates.
It was leased two weeks ago by a blind corporation.
No other info on them yet.
Wait a minute, Joe.
Blue shirt, pinstripe.
Oh, yeah, that' s him.
That' s our man right there.
Just in time to watch Stanley find our worm.
In college, I created the source code for the worm I use.
In the basement is the only PDP- 10 still active and on the Internet.
Not many people know it.
It' s an ITS machine, kept online for historical sake.
I hid my worm there, where no one would ever look.
Voilà.
Good man.
Good man.
Senator, we have a problem.
- Senator.
- Seems you' re in a predicament.
Is that right?
- I don' t follow.
- Download your file.
- Senator -- - You know where I got these?
From the deputy director of the FBl.
He thought I might be interested.
Sir, do you think there is any aspect of this operation I am not aware of?
We are aborting the operation.
Take a vacation.
A vacation?
Have I ever failed you, sir?
- That' s not really the point, is it?
- It' s my point.
You' re losing sight of our objective.
The risks are too great.
We' il seek alternative means of finance.
This operation is moving ahead.
Everything is under control.
Son...... let' s just say you' ve got a 200- pound Rottweiler.
Now, he loves you.
It' s his job to protect you.
But if he bites you, you got to put him down.
Can never tell who he might bite next.
You understand?
Yes, I do understand, senator.
I think we got a team on the West Coast.
Fort MacArthur.
Maybe they should pay our friend a visit.
Come on.
Network IP range.
Confirmed.
Please confirm.
Confirm.
Confirm.
We are cruising!
Oh, yeah.
Next.
And next.
Too easy.
No, don' t.
No, no, no.
Yes!
Three percent, please.
Oh, fuck.
I' m fucked.
No, no, no.
Fuck you!
Shit, there' s no fucking way.
Rusty.
Come on, come on.
Okay.
Time to disguise you...... as an internal destruction.
Quick, quick.
Thank you.
Return.
Three, two, one, go.
Come on.
Come on.
Yeah.
Close.
Yes.
Oh, baby.
Now I' ve just got to modify the code.
The bank' s IDS logs every packer...... that go to any port other than the 22 or 80 TCP.
Holy shit.
Okay, Château Attigue 1996.
White, white.
Nope.
Come on, come on.
Here we go.
Twenty- six.
Ninety- six.
Nine --
Oh, shit!
What' s the matter?
You look like you' ve seen a ghost.
- We gotta talk.
- Let' s take a drive.
- Can' t we talk here?
- We shouldn' t.
Ever heard of Harry Houdini?
He wasn' t like today' s magicians, only interested in television ratings.
He was an artist.
He could make an elephant disappear in a full theater.
You know how he did that?
- Misdirection.
- What are you talking about?
Misdirection.
What the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes.
- What' s going on?
- We' ve got a tail.
Hold on.
Shit.
Jesus.
Jesus!
Take the wheel.
- What?
- Take the wheel!
Holy shit!
Who are those guys?
Jesus!
What the fuck are you doing?
Jesus!
Drive, Stan.
Move!
- I can' t drive this thing.
- Learn!
- Move it.
- Come on!
Hard left!
Hard left!
Keep going!
Go!
Get in the car.
Not until you tell me what I' m involved in.
Look, Stanley, I like you.
You' re on my good side.
But don' t confuse kindness with weakness.
You have 12 hours to get the hydra.
So get in the car.
Stanley, are you okay?
I just saw that maniac murder people in the street.
I' m fucking great.
You can' t leave.
It' il all work out.
You gotta trust me.
Trust you?
Yeah.
You' re DEA, I got the feds up my ass and I don' t know what' s going on here.
If we don' t find out who he works for, we' il have to start over.
That' s not my problem.
I don' t care who he works for.
What about Holly?
Do you give a shit about her?
Finish the job.
We' il get your daughter back.
I promise.
Ah, the great American outdoors.
Yet I never understood the appeal of fly- fishing.
A bit too much like masturbation for me without the payoff.
This is a catch- and- release stream, isn' t it?
Yeah, I believe it is.
You must see the irony in that, senator.
Chairman of the subcommittee on crime fishing in a catch- and- release stream.
How could you do it to me, Jim?
After all we suffered.
I' ve changed my identity so often I don' t know who I am anymore.
How could you do it?
We were so close to our goal!
The FBI was watching you.
You tried to kill me.
You' ve misplaced your loyalty, senator.
You' ve sold out America.
Patriotism does not have a four- year shelf life.
But politicians do.
What are you doing with that?
Thomas Jefferson once shot a man for treason.
Hold the phone.
Thomas Jeff --
- Stan.
How are you?
- Fine.
Finished?
Is this Stanley Jobson, social security number 669- 54- 7311?
I' m calling from Credit Suisse to notify you...... that $10 million was transferred into your new account.
- As promised.
- Thanks.
So I' m done, then.
Soon.
Walk with me.
Against my better judgment, I' m going to tell you who I am.
- I know who you are.
- Do you?
I think you think I' m a bank robber.
But the truth is, I' m just like you.
Like me?
No.
Because you' re a murderer.
That I am, and worse.
Rules I adhere to.
- Why are you telling me this?
- Well, if you listen, then you' il know.
You asked who those men were.
I' il tell you.
Hoover started a secret organization in the '50s, called Black Cell.
To protect our freedoms.
I don' t care.
All I care about is my daughter.
I' m talking about your daughter.
You, your daughter...... and 200 million Americans who take their freedoms for granted.
I see.
You don' t know what it takes to protect our freedoms.
That' s my job.
To protect your way of life.
So you' re really stealing all this money just to protect little old me.
That' s right, Stanley.
Because wars cost money.
War?
Who are we at war with?
Anyone who impinges on America' s freedom.
Terrorist states, Stanley.
Someone must bring their war to them.
They bomb a church, we bomb 10.
They hijack a plane, we take out an airport.
They execute American tourists, we nuke an entire city.
We make terrorism so horrific that it' s unthinkable to attack Americans.
You' re going into the bank.
And you' re coming with us.
It' il all be over in 24 hours.
You' re a rich man, Stanley.
Soon you' il be on a yacht with your daughter, eating bonbons.
The American dream.
And just think:
You' il have done your small part in ensuring America' s way of life.
You' re a hero, Stan.
Stay there!
Don' t worry.
Let him go.
He' il be back.
Okay, load them up.
Let' s move out.
Let' s go!
Back!
Move it, move it!
Let' s move!
Let' s go.
Hands behind your head.
Let' s go!
Key, please.
What key?
I don' t know about any key.
Key.
Let' s move!
Back of the bank.
Now!
Let' s go, let' s go!
Down.
Everyone down!
Just wait here.
Hello?
Melissa?
Holly!
Oh, God.
Holly!
Baby!
Baby.
Baby.
Shit!
No!
Release the hostage!
- Help me!
- Let her go!
Let her go!
- Nick.
- Yeah.
- You all right?
- I' m good.
- That was your decision!
- No, you did that!
I want that plane on the runway in 25 minutes!
He wants a plane on the runway in 25 minutes.
My suggestion, sir?
You give it to him!
He wants a plane?
I' il give him a goddamn plane.
- Finish the job.
- Not until I see my daughter!
You want to see her?
Get him his daughter!
- Dad!
- Oh, Jesus.
Baby, are you okay?
It' s okay, it' s okay.
You son of a bitch.
You think I wanted it to come to this?
I' il sacrifice any lives I have to to protect this country.
Including my own.
Let her go.
And I' il get your money.
You finish the job, and you both go.
Come on, Stanley.
- I need the disc.
- Disc.
- How do you want it allocated?
- Spread evenly over the accounts.
Come on.
Done.
Give me my daughter.
- Verify this.
- Good.
Get her.
You okay?
Okay, come on.
Stanley, hold up.
Good job.
- See you around.
- I doubt it.
What' s happening?
What' s happening?
- The money' s gone.
- Stop her!
Go!
Run!
Go!
She' s coming out.
Come here, come here!
What happened, Stan?
The explosion scrambled the internal clock.
No, it didn' t.
You fucked me.
You kill me, you' il never get a dollar.
The money jumps every 60 seconds from one account to another.
It' il do so for the next 10 years.
It wasn' t supposed to happen for another six hours, but hey.
- Fix it.
- Unfortunately, I can' t.
The accounts are encrypted with a 1024- bit cipher.
Even I can' t get through the firewall.
So here' s the deal:
Let the hostages go and I' il tell you how to get the money.
We all walk away.
Nobody gets hurt.
Deal?
I' m thinking.
No deal.
Get Ginger.
Move out.
- What are you doing?
- String her up.
- No.
Don' t do this.
- No!
Wait, Wait!
Hey, stay still!
It' il feel real good.
No, don' t do this!
- How long will she live?
60 seconds?
- You' re insane!
- Fifty- five.
- Okay, okay.
- Hope you built in a back door.
- Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
Thirty.
Plane' s on the runway in a half- hour.
Good.
Twenty.
- She' s dying.
- Shut the fuck up!
Ten.
Nine.
Eight.
Accounts, accounts.
That' s it.
There it is.
Get her down!
- Check.
- Verified.
Bring her down.
Jesus.
She was DEA, Stan.
Move them out!
Let' s move.
Quickly and quietly.
- Go, go!
- Move it.
Come on, people.
Move.
Move.
No one wants a repeat of this morning.
Keep your distance.
Clear the air space for five miles.
They' re on the move.
Move, move.
What?
I know what you' re thinking.
You' re thinking:
If that launcher was a suppository...... would that bad man stick it up my ass?
Well, you eyeball me once more, boy...... I' il stick it so far up your ass...... you' il be begging me for this bullet.
This bus is your new holding area.
If you don' t test your collars, this will all be over soon.
Let' s get this son of a bitch.
- How can you justify all this?
- You' re not looking at the big picture.
Here' s a scenario:
You can cure all diseases, but the price...... is that you must kill one innocent child.
No.
You disappoint me.
It' s the greatest good.
- How about 10 innocents?
- Now you get it.
How about 100?
1000?
To preserve our way of life.
No man has the right to make that decision.
You' re just a terrorist.
You' re wrong, Stanley.
Thousands die every day for no reason.
Where' s your bleeding heart for them?
You give $20 to Greenpeace thinking you change the world.
What country will harbor terrorists when they see the consequences?
Did you know I can buy nuclear warheads in Minsk for 40 million?
Hell, I buy half a dozen, I even get a discount.
Advise Joy 20 minutes ETA at the airport.
Control, please let A. D. Joy know we' re 20 minutes from the airport.
- Ready?
- Bird' s fueled, ready to go.
- What about your pilot?
- He' s in the works now.
All right.
Let' s do it.
Okay, I need a team over here.
The rest of you, let' s go outside.
Fuck!
Jesus.
What the fuck is he thinking?
- Aren' t we going to the airport?
- Misdirection, Stan.
What are you doing?
Where are you taking the thing?
You see Sugarland Express?
Didn' t like the way it ended.
Pull over before you get --
They can' t be serious.
Hold on!
Attention control, this has now become an aerial pursuit.
I' ve also got people across the tarmac.
Sir, I' ve just been informed that the bus is no longer en route to LAX.
- What happened?
-... and turned onto First Street.
- All right.
Let' s go.
Sir, the bus is no longer on First Street.
Then where is it?
Airborne.
- What' s he doing?
- We have a strong wind condition.
Tell him to climb!
Climb, goddamn it!
Climb!
Down!
Everybody down!
Add action or excitement, or change the direction of the entire campaign.
Maybe we ought to rethink the visuals.
Holy shit.
Secure a perimeter around the building.
I want everybody out of this lobby right now.
Secure the elevators and stairs!
Anybody coming out, detain them!
- What' s going on?
- The elevators to the roof?
- Up there.
- And the freight elevator?
- Rear of the building.
- That way.
Stan- man.
Take care of your girl.
Maybe I' il see you around.
No!
It' s not going to end like this.
Come on, Stan.
Not everything ends as you think it should.
Besides...... audiences love happy endings.
Stay here!
Shit!
Come on.
Move, move!
- No, Stanley!
- Come on.
Get him out of here.
Secure that weapon.
Let' s go.
Gentlemen.
You here to identify the body?
The dentals match those the Israeli government sent us...... for an ex- Mossad agent named Gabriel Shear.
Excuse me, sir.
The DEA has no record of any Ginger Knowles working for them.
I checked all the hospitals and morgues, and I can' t find her body.
Look again.
Bodies just don' t disappear.
Right.
He could make an elephant disappear...... in a full theater.
You know how he did that?
Misdirection.
I' m DEA, Stanley.
Give him the worm, take the money and get out of here.
What the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes.
Misdirection, Stan.
This is a bad guy.
Nobody' s going to miss him.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I' m good.
Why don' t you get out of here?
Go see your daughter.
Yeah, thanks.
We' il be in touch.
You son of a bitch.
- Thank you.
You' re done?
- Yes, I' m full.
Let' s go.
So, navigator, where' s our next stop?
- Holbrook.
- Holbrook.
- So what' s in Holbrook?
- The Petrified Forest, Dad.
- I think you take the I- 40 to the 180.
- Cool.
Alrighty.
- Are you okay, Dad?
- Yeah, I' m fine, sweetheart.
Okay.
Don' t worry, Dad.
It' s going to be okay.
- We' re going to be fine.
- I know, honey.
I' d like to transfer money from my employer' s account.
May I have your account number and password, please?
356127G.
Password:
Swordfish.
How much would you like to transfer?
All of it.
Evenly over these accounts.
It' s done.
In international news, terrorist Allal bin- Hazzad...... was killed today in an unexplained explosion...... on a yacht in the Mediterranean.
The elusive bin- Hazzad was thought responsible for...... the U. S. embassy bombing in Istanbul earlier this month.
This is the third killing of a terrorist leader in as many weeks.
There.
Technicals, nine o' clock.
Oh, shit!
Did you see that?
Chief, we got unarmed civilians getting shot down here at nine o' clock.
I got it, Matt.
I don' t think we can touch this.
{Y: i} Command, Super 64... {Y: i}... we got militia shooting civilians at the food distribution centre.
Request permission to engage.
Over.
{Y: i} Negative, command.
{Y: i} U. N. 's jurisdiction, 64.
We cannot intervene.
{Y: i} - Return to base.
{Y: i} 64 returning.
Leaving.
General Garrison?
No, thanks.
I got one.
But these are Cuban.
So is this.
Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.
I see not catching Aidid is becoming a routine.
Me?
But am I that important?
I hardly think so.
- You' re just a businessman.
Yeah.
Selling guns to Aidid' s militia.
You' ve been here, what?
Six weeks?
Six weeks you are trying to catch the general.
What is this?
Gunfight at the K. O. Corral?
It' s the O. K. Corral.
Do you think bringing me in will make him suddenly come to you?
Make him more agreeable?
You pay for his beds, much less his militia.
And we will find him.
Don' t think because I grew up without running water...... I am simple, General.
I do know something about history.
See all this?
It' s simply shaping tomorrow.
A tomorrow without a lot of Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.
I' m from Texas.
Mr. Garrison, I think you shouldn' t have come here.
This is civil war.
This is our war.
Not yours.
300, 000 dead and counting.
That' s not a war, Mr. Atto.
That' s genocide.
Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?
How' d he strike you?
Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.
Yeah, he' s a good catch.
It' il take time, but Aidid will feel the loss.
I' m not sure time is something we got in great supply.
This isn' t Iraq, you know.
Much more complicated than that.
Boss, most of Washington might disagree.
They' ve been calling for situation reports every morning this week.
Well, tell them the situation is fragile.
{Y: i} Ladies and gentlemen, I' m Cliff "Elvis" Wolcott.
{Y: i} I' il be your pilot today.
Federal regulations designate this a non- smoking Black Hawk helicopter.
Those in Mogadishu frequent flyer program will earn 100 free credits.
Number one indications are good, Cliff.
{Y: i} 61, this is 64.
Go to UHF secure.
I' ve got some bad news.
"Limo" is a word, Durant.
I don' t want to hear about it.
It' s an abbreviation of a word.
"Limo" is a word in common usage.
That is the key phrase in Scrabble, my good friend.
{Y: i} It doesn' t have to be in the dictionary!
{Y: i} It does have to be in the dictionary!
When we get back to the base, it' s coming off.
{Y: i} You touch my "limo" and I' il spank you, Nightstalker.
Yeah, promises.
That' s a nice beach down there.
How' s the water?
Yeah, it' s nice and warm.
And it' s loaded with sharks.
- Todd.
- Last name.
- Blackburn.
- So, what' s it like?
- What' s what like?
The fighting.
- Serial number.
- 72163427.
Firstly, it' s "the Mog" or simply "Mog".
No one calls it Mogadishu here.
Why not?
Didn' t I just say, "Don' t ask"?
You look like you' re about 12, so let me explain something to you.
I have a rare and mysterious skill that precludes me from doing missions.
- Can you type?
- Date of birth.
Well, I' m here to kick some ass.
Very smooth!
Single shot through the engine block.
Shit, that' s a shame.
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
Check your weapons!
Sergeant Eversmann.
Private First Class Blackburn.
Yeah?
Reporting for duty.
Not to me.
You' re reporting to Lt. Beales.
He should be here somewhere.
Can I leave him with you?
Yeah, go ahead.
- Yes, sir.
Want me to shoot?
I' m rested.
- When did you get in?
- Just now, Sergeant.
Hey, who' s hungry?
What is this, Sarg' nt?
Another taxpayer- funded Delta safari?
- Not if General Garrison is asking.
Have a nice meal, Captain.
- Hey, man, there' s a line.
- Well, this isn' t the back of it.
Sergeant.
Sergeant.
What' s going on here?
Some aerial target practice, sir.
Didn' t want to leave it behind.
I' m talking about your weapon.
Delta or no Delta, that' s a hot weapon.
You know better than that.
Safety should be on at all times on base.
Well, this is my safety, sir.
Let it go, sir.
The guy hasn' t eaten in a couple of days.
You Delta boys are a bunch of undisciplined cowboys.
Let me tell you something, Sarg' nt.
When we get on a five- yard line, you' re going to need my Rangers.
Y' all better learn to be team players.
We' re done here.
You say this is your safety?
Well, this is my boot, son.
And it will fit up your ass with the proper amount of force.
Take those sunglasses off.
Delta wants to wear Oakleys, that' s their business.
I don' t want to see them on you again.
Is that your move?
Is my hand on the piece?
I can mate you in three whatever you do.
I' d keep my eye on that queen before counselling others.
Well, she' s just lying in wait.
Yikes.
It' s good.
You' re really improving.
If I may make a suggestion...
Go ahead.
- It' s a children' s book, right?
They are not supposed to scare the living shit out of the children.
This is the part of the story where our knight is slaying the dragon.
Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.
You done?
Hey, we are at the 10- yard line here, men.
You understand?
One, two, ten.
Okay?
Where are my running backs?
Where are my running backs?
Hey, I didn' t see you at church on Sunday.
You had something more important to do?
Not on Sunday, you don' t.
Not anymore.
I will make you believe, you understand?
Pretty funny, hoo- ah?
It was a good impression.
I recognize myself.
All right, carry on.
- I' d like a word, specialist.
- Sir.
Roger that, sir.
If you ever undermine me again, you' il clean latrines with your tongue...... till you taste no difference between shit and French fries.
- Hoo- ah, sir.
All right.
Listen to this:
Camels.
I wouldn' t pay one camel.
Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.
Is that really true, Lieutenant?
He likes skinnies.
Sgt. Eversmann, you really like the skinnies?
It' s not that I like them or I don' t like them.
I respect them.
See, what you guys fail to realize is the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.
He believes in this mission down to his bones.
Don' t you, Sergeant?
Look, these people, they have no jobs...... no food, no education, no future.
I just figure that, I mean, we have two things that we can do.
We can help...... or we can sit back and watch the country destroy itself on CNN.
I don' t know about you guys, but I was trained to fight.
Are you trained to fight, Sergeant?
Well, I think I was trained to make a difference, Kurth.
Like the man said, he' s an idealist.
Oh, wait.
{Y: i} Stay away from the cans!
{Y: i} Die, gas- pumper!
No, no, stay back.
Put something in his mouth.
John, it' s okay.
John, it' s okay.
Well, he' il be fine.
But not in this army.
He' s out of the game.
He' s epileptic, going home.
I' m putting you in charge of his chalk.
- You got a problem with that?
- No, sir.
It' s a big responsibility.
Your men will look to you to make the right decisions.
All right.
- Rangers lead the way, sir.
- All the way.
Good luck.
{Y: i} A meeting of Aidid' s senior cabinet may take place today at 1500 hours.
I say "may" because we all know by now...... with the intel we get on the street, nothing is certain.
This is actual intel confirmed by three sources.
Two tier- one personalities may be present:
Omar Salad, Aidid' s top political advisor...... and Abdi Hassan Awale, interior minister.
These are the guys we' re after.
Today we go.
Same mission template as before.
1545, Assault Force Delta will infiltrate the target building...... and seize all suspects within.
4 Ranger chalks, under command of Capt. Steele...... will rope in at 1546...... and hold a four- corner perimeter around the target building.
No one gets in or out.
Extraction Force:
Lt. Colonel McKnight' s humvee column will drive in at 1547...... on Hawlwadig Road and hold just short of the Olympic Hotel.
Wait for the green light.
Now once Delta gives the word...... McKnight' s column will go to the target and load the prisoners onto trucks.
Immediately after the prisoners are loaded...... the four Ranger chalks will collapse back to the target building...... load up on humvees...... and the entire ground force will exfil the 3 miles back to base.
Mission time, no longer than 30 minutes.
Now, I had requested light armour and AC- 130 Spectre gunships...... but Washington, in all its wisdom, decided against this.
So Black Hawks and Little Birds will provide the air cover...... with miniguns and 2. 75 rockets.
Colonel Harrell.
In the C- 2 bird, Colonel Matthews will coordinate the air mission...... and I will coordinate ground forces.
Colonel Matthews.
Mission launch code word is Irene.
Questions?
Which building is it, sir?
We' re confirming that now.
Somewhere near the Bakara market.
I don' t choose the time or place of their meetings.
I didn' t say a word, sir.
Make no mistake, once you' re in the Bakara market...... you' re in an entirely hostile district.
Don' t underestimate their capabilities.
We' il be in friendly neighbourhoods before we hit the market...... so remember the rules of engagement:
No one fires unless fired upon.
Now, let' s go get this thing done.
Good luck, gentlemen.
What' s the matter, Danny?
Something you don' t like?
No Spectre gunships, daylight instead of night...... afternoon when they' re all fucked up on khat...... only part of the city Aidid can mount a counter- attack on short notice...
- What' s not to like?
- Life' s imperfect.
For you two, circling above it at 500 feet, it' s imperfect.
Down in the street, it' s unforgiving.
- Well?
- Well, what?
We going?
- Why should I tell you that?
Yeah.
Downtown.
- All right.
Listen, Smith, I need you to back me up out there today, all right?
Keep sharp.
Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.
Ev, it' s going to be nothing, man.
It' s all in the grind, Sizemore.
Can' t be too fine, can' t be too coarse.
This, my friend, is a science.
You' re looking at the guy that believed the commercials.
About "be all you can be".
I made coffee through Desert Storm.
I made coffee through Panama, while everyone else got to fight...... got to be a Ranger.
Now it' s "Grimesy, black, one sugar" or "Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"
- What happened to you?
- Ping- Pong accident.
What?
So guess what.
You' re going out today.
You' re fucking me.
You' re taking my place assisting the 60 gunner.
Sergeant Eversmann said to get your stuff and get ready.
It' s what you wanted, isn' t it?
Oh, yeah.
Hell, yeah.
Grimesy, stick with Waddell and give him ammo when he needs it.
- Hoo- ah?
- Hoo- ah.
I wouldn' t worry about that.
Generally speaking, Somalis can' t shoot for shit.
Just watch out for the sammys throwing the rocks, and you' il be fine.
D- boys do their thing now.
All we got to do is cover them.
Choppers going to cover us, and we' il be all right.
Look, you guys, this is my first time as chalk leader...... but, this isn' t our first time out together.
We' re Rangers, not some sorry- ass JROTC.
We' re elite.
Let' s act like it out there.
Hoo- ah?
Any questions?
We' re going to be okay.
Let' s move out.
You' re not going to need that, dude.
We' il be back before dark.
You might as well take dope and beer instead.
What?
Take ammo.
Let me tell you something, Grimes.
You don' t need another 12.
I don' t know about you, I don' t plan on getting shot running away.
Well, I better keep mine in.
Grimes.
Most important thing:
Remember, when everyone is shooting, shoot in the same direction.
Look at this.
He' s taping his blood type to his boots.
- That' s bad luck.
All Delta do that.
That' s bad luck too, man.
Come on, let' s go.
It' s a good thing you' re right- handed, Adonis.
- Lf not, I don' t know what you' d do.
- You' re a funny guy, man.
- I' m not taking no death letter.
I' il give it to you back in an hour.
- Blackburn, you okay?
- Excited.
In a good way.
I' ve been training my whole life for this.
You ever shot at anybody before?
Me neither.
Think he' s reliable?
Well, we' il see.
It' s his first time out.
- Yes, sir.
Tell him to turn his radio off.
Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.
You' ve reached Stephanie and Randy, leave us a message.
{Y: i} Hey, baby, it' s me.
Are you there?
{Y: i} Pick up if you' re there.
I' m just calling to make sure everything' s all right.
I' il call you in a couple hours.
You' d better not be sleeping.
Your move, Randy.
{Y: i} I' m missing you.
I love you, baby.
Hello?
Thanks, bud.
You know, it' s kind of funny.
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.
Could almost be a good place to visit.
Almost.
You don' t think we should be here.
You know what I think?
It don' t really matter what I think.
Once that first bullet goes past your head, politics and all that shit...... just goes right out the window.
I just want to do it right today.
Get all your men back here alive.
Now, is this supposed to be the place, or did his car just take a dump?
{Y: i} Abdi, come in.
Abdi, can you hear me?
Is this the place?
{Y: i} Abdi, come in.
{Y: i} Can you hear me?
{Y: i} Abdi, come in.
Is this the place?
To my right side, above the cafe.
{Y: i} He says this is the building.
He' s certain?
{Y: i} Abdi, you need to be sure.
Are you sure?
Well, it' s down the road, two blocks over on my left.
But there' s too many militia.
{Y: i} If I go closer, they might shoot me.
{Y: i} Now he' s saying the building' s a couple blocks down...... but if he' s seen outside it, he' il be shot.
I' il fucking shoot him myself.
Tell him I want his skinny ass parked in front of the building.
He' s not getting paid till he does exactly that.
We' re never off the main roads.
At K- four traffic circle, we turn north, then east on National...... and we wait until extraction of prisoners is complete here.
Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig...... load the prisoners, the assault- blocking forces and bring them back.
Home in an hour.
Okay?
There will be some shooting.
Bakara market is the Wild West.
People do live there.
Hoo- ah.
Last one of these guys shot himself in the head playing Russian roulette.
{Y: i} Sir, the vehicle is stopped.
So this is the real deal now.
He' s sure this time.
{Y: i} - He sounds scared shitless.
- Good.
That' s always a good sign.
{Y: i} That' s it.
That' s our signal.
All right.
All QRF out of the airspace.
All QRF out of the airspace.
All units, Irene.
I say again, Irene.
{Y: i} Check in when ready.
Barber 51 up and ready.
Star 41 up and ready.
Irene!
Fucking Irene!
Come on.
Good luck, boys.
Be careful.
No one gets left behind.
What' s wrong?
He' s just never done that before.
Aw, fuck!
Sergeant Struecker.
{Y: i} Two minutes.
Two minutes.
Why are they burning tires?
Signals to the militia that we' re coming!
One minute.
One minute.
What' s that for?
Last rope, I almost bit my tongue off.
{Y: i} Two feet, one foot... {Y: i}... clear.
{Y: i} Little Birds touching down at target.
Ropes!
Go!
{Y: i} Chalk One troops are on the deck.
Chalk Two deployed.
{Y: i} This is McKnight.
Uniform 64 approaching staging area.
Get down!
Everybody down!
Let' s go, let' s go!
Grimesy!
No fear!
Oh, yeah, right!
Four corners.
Colonel, they' re shooting at us!
Colonel, they' re shooting at us!
Well, shoot back!
Chalks on the ground, going into holding pattern.
Going to cover pattern.
{Y: i} Super 62, take up an overhead pattern to provide sniper cover.
{Y: i} This is Super 65.
Go, Blackburn, go!
Go!
Go, Blackburn!
RPG!
Hold on!
No!
{Y: i} C- 2, we got a man fallen.
{Y: i} Super- 61, you' re a sitting duck.
{Y: i} Take up overhead pattern to provide sniper cover.
{Y: i} Roger that.
{Y: i} 13, go ahead.
I need you to move to the north of the street.
{Y: i} Right to the north.
Doc Schmid!
Come on!
Schmid, we got a man hit.
- Where' s he hit?
- He' s not.
He fell.
- What?
Why aren' t you shooting?
We' re not being shot at yet!
How can you tell?
A snap means...
Now they' re shooting at us!
Galentine!
Get me Captain Steele!
Get me Captain Steele!
Come in.
Over.
Blackburn, can you hear me?
Juliet 64, this is 25.
Over.
I can' t get him!
Juliet 64, this is Chalk Four!
We' ve got a man down!
We need to get him out of here!
Over.
This is 64.
Say again, 25.
Over.
{Y: i} We' ve got a man down!
Take a breath, 25, and calm down.
Over.
{Y: i} - Man down!
- Missed that, 25.
- Say again.
Matt, it' s a long way to the humvees!
We' il get a stretcher in here.
Get him to the target building.
What did he say?
{Y: i} Super 61, we got a man wounded on the ground.
- Stretcher!
- Get me a stretcher!
Stretcher.
Come on, come on!
Grab this end!
Let' s go!
- Go.
We' il hold down the corner.
Up to the humvees!
Go!
Keep moving, Grimes!
- Let' s move out!
Everybody up!
Come on!
Let' s go!
- Grimes, run!
{Y: i} C- 2, this is Super 61, beginning my orbit of the target area.
{Y: i} Chalk Four, clear for a clear.
{Y: i} Kilo 11, this is 61, providing cover for prisoner extract.
Kilo 64, green light.
{Y: i} - Ready for extraction.
- Roger that.
Will relay.
We got them.
{Y: i} Uniform 64, ready for extraction.
Over.
Roger that.
Let' s move out!
- Let' s move out!
- How much longer?
- Five minutes, sir.
- What?
- Five minutes.
Nothing takes five minutes!
What happened to him?
- He fell!
Missed the rope!
Put him in that humvee!
Grimes, give him a hand!
Let' s move it!
Come on!
Everybody move!
Get the fuck up!
Come on!
Grimes!
Fuck this!
Fuck!
Go!
Romeo 64, I need to send out three humvees with a casualty.
I need to evac now.
Roger that, Uniform 64.
Over.
Roger that.
I need extra security on these humvees!
I' il take my team, make sure they get back okay.
Struecker, you' re lead humvee.
{Y: i} First three vehicles mount up, we' re moving back to base.
Move out!
How are things going?
Things okay there, Struecker?
I don' t want to talk about it now, Colonel!
{Y: i} I' m busy.
Sergeant Pilla' s hit!
Christ, he' s fucked up!
{Y: i} Is anyone hit?
Struecker, talk to me!
It' s Sergeant Pilla!
{Y: i} What' s his status?
What' s his status?
He' s dead.
He' s dead.
{Y: i} Pilla' s dead, sir.
{Y: i} C- 2, this is McKnight.
We have a KlA Dominick Pilla.
Over.
{Y: i} Roger that.
Someone get on that 50!
It' s mine.
Three guys with RPGs, coming up on your side now!
Stay with it!
I' m hit.
{Y: i} Super 61 is hit.

Oh Austin, behave.
Hey Powers!
You better watch your freaking self.
Because this is one doctor who does make house calls.
Right, Mini- Me?
Hey, assholes!
I' m right over here, I' m Mini- Me.
And cut!
- That' s a cut everybody.
So Austin, what do you think of the opening credits?
Is making a movie about my life.
Very shaggadelic baby, yeah!
Having said that, I do have some thoughts
Really?
My friend here thinks it' s fine the way it is.
No offence sir Stevie, but you got to have Mojo baby, yeah!

This is where the movie gets its Mojo baby.

"Dr. Evil' s Hollywood Lair"
Welcome back Herr Doctor.
How was space?
Space was cool, wasn' t it Mini- Me?
Doctor Evil, while you were in space, I created a way for us to make huge sums of legitimate money
And still maintain the ethics in the business practices of an evil organization.
The Hollywood talent agency.
Really?
By charging A- list clients 9% rather than the traditional 10%
We' ve been able to sign such stars as George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Leo DiCaprio.
And the best part of the whole scheme is, we all get our own assistants.
Wow!
I' m really excited to be part of the team here at HTA.
Very impressive, number 2.
But I finally have the perfect plan.
In the 70' s, there lived a Dutch metallurgical heathenish by the name of Uhand Van Der Smutt.
He invented a cold fusion power unit, for a "Tractor beam"
"Tractor Beam"
Powerful enough to pull a meteor to earth.
The meteor was called "Midas 22".
Is he sleeping?
I guess Mini- Me won' t get any chocolate!
Use your words like a big boy clone.
He' s okay!
It' s from Brugge.
That' s in Belgium, that' s where daddy' s from.
Check out Mini- Me.
Your chair, Dr. Evil.
Thank you.
You know when you have kids, I think your going to find that all kids are different aye?
For example, Mini- Me loves chocolate.
What?
Scotty don' t!
Oh yeah, that' s very familiar, hang on let me do what I do, would you stop?
Honestly, isn' t this?
How about you don' t ladies and gentlemen, Scotty don' t.
Dr. Evil, perhaps it' s time that you finished unveiling your plan?
Thank you, number 2.
My plan is, Scotty don' t.
Oh come on, you' re such a lame ass!
You know this is causing me serious psychological harm.
Fine you know what?
I would love some chocolate.
Thank you.
Come on!
You okay, Mini- Me?
Did I pull too hard?
I don' t want to hurt you.
Dr. Evil.
Was does Goldmembers plan have to do with us?
Our early attempts at a tractor beam
Preparations A- T were a complete failure.
But now ladies and gentlemen, we finally have a working tractor beam which we shall call "Preparation H"
Why don' t you just call it operation ass- cream you ass.
I' m sorry did you want some ice- cream?
Yes, I' d love some chocolate ass- cream.
Perhaps later.
Doctor Evil, I love your plan.
Yeah Herr Doctor, it' s a really good plan.
Yes frau, on the whole I think "Preparation H" feels good.
No, nothing.
You know what?
I agree "Preparation H" does feel good.
On the whole.
Well I’ m glad were speaking the same language.
Ladies and gentlemen, using my time machine I shall travel back to 1975, pick up Goldmember
No one can stop me.
Not even Austin Powers.
Not so fast.
You' re surrounded Dr. Evil.
Doctor Evil, the world court sentences you to 400 years.
Do you have anything to say?
No, but I think Mini Me does.
Looks like 2 eggs and a hanky.
The criminal genius known as Dr Evil and his clone were sentenced today at the world organization.
For his efforts, Austin Powers, son of England’ s most famous spy Nigel Powers.
Will be knighted by the queen at Buckingham Palace.
Arise, sir Austin Powers.
Thank you, your majesty.
Your father must be very proud of you.
Oh yeah.
Come on dad, stand up and take a bow.
"Austin' s Pad"
I am a sexy beast.
Its Austin Powers, you' re so funny.
Also very sexy.
Can I have an autograph?
Of course, your name is?
Oh behave baby, now your name is?
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Your NAME is Fook Mi.
You want a drink?
Yes of course, but I have a private bar in the back that you are more than welcome to use
Here you go.
Fook Mi, that was fast.
You' re going the right way for a smack bottom
And I don' t care who knows it.
Austin, this is my twin sister, Her name Fook Yu.
Twins??
I also think Austin Powers is very sexy.
Do we make you sleepy?
Well you make me many things but sleepy is not one of them.
We give you top secret massage.
Sorry about that, I swear to god, that never happens.
Hold on a tick.
"Things to do before I die" "Have threesome with Japanese twins".
Austin, I' m sorry to interrupt.
Twins Basil, twins.
Austin, it' s your father.
What?
So that' s why he wasn' t at the knighting ceremony
No actually.
He was kidnapped after you were knighted.
He was last seen on his yacht.
Oh, yes, the "HMS Shag at Sea".
Exactly, just take a look.
Gentlemen fall in.
Austin, these men were assigned to guard your father.
Okay chaps chins up, trousers down.
I think we might have found a clue.
All your privates have had their privates painted gold.
Okay.
Basil there' s only one person in the world who truly
Understands the psychology of a mad man.
"Maximum Security Facility Geneva".
I' ve been expecting you, Mr Powers.
My father is missing.
How ironic.
But then again
You' ve always needed me haven' t you Mr Powers?
Remember when I told you, we are not so different you and I?
See, I did say that.
Very clever.
Now who has my father?
Nothing could be my father from the truth.
You said my father.
No, I dadn' t, didn' t, did not.
For me this is a dad issue.
Daddy didn' t love me.
It seems like the knighting ceremony wasn' t the only time your daddy let you down.
Remember that day at the academy?
It was graduation.
"British Intelligence Academy 1958"
Have you ever heard of knocking, man?
We were just getting started.
Don' t forget Mr Powers later you have a brief oral exam.
It looks like Master Evil is the top contender for this years international man of mystery.
He' s number 1 in the class.
Hey, everybody I' m number 1.
Hello, I' m number 2.
Nice to meet you number 2.
But now I' m going to be named international man of mystery
Honestly?
And now it' s time to award our greatest honour this years international man of mystery is.
Austin Powers - Well done Austin
It' s always been my dream to win this award just like my dad.
I' m glad he could be here, stand up dad, take a bow.
Dad?
I had the best brains in the class and I didn' t get diddly squat.
Tell me Austin Powers, what did you find on those sailors?
A golden surprise?
All the sailors had their meat and two wedge painted gold.
Yes, it' s the distinctive calling card of a criminal mastermind.
Named, Goldmember.
How can I find this Goldmember?
Yes, squid pro ruoe.
Transfer to a regular prison, so that I can be with my beloved Mini- Me.
Ok I' il get you a transfer to a regular prison, now where' s goldmember?
Not where Mr Powers, but when.
1975 Studio 69 disco, New York city.
Corner 69 and 8th
Goldmembers hiding him in 1975.
So our engineers have crafted this vehicle, to time travel to the seventies.
- Yes I knew it would tickle your fancy.
What can I say?
Good luck, Austin.
1975, yeah baby, yeah.
"New York City 1975, Studio 69"
And welcome to studio 69.
Here he is ladies and gentlemen, Goldmember.
Hey everybody, I' m from Holland isn' t that weird?
I' m sorry?
You got a lot of nerve dragging your jive white ass in here.
I don' t believe we' ve met.
It' s me Foxy, Foxxy Cleopatra.
Stop.
We can' t be seen talking to each other, you dig?
I' m using this cat as a distraction.
I get it yes, very clever.
First things first.
Nobody stands up Foxy Cleopatra.
Listen Foxy, I just want you to know I never intended to hurt you baby.
Well all I know is, momma only got a taste of honey.
You always knew how to make me smile.
What am I doing?
Foxy, what are you doing in Goldmember' s club?
I' m under cover.
About a year ago my partner at the bureau was killed.
And that jive ass cold turkey Goldmember is the prime suspect.
Thanks Foxy.
Austin, good luck.
Hello son.
Just over powering my guards.
Come quickly
I got a better idea.
Why don' t you rescue me in about 7 or 8 minutes.
I don' t want to see my dad on the job.
I' m sorry.
What' s wrong with your neck?
I took a Viagra, got stuck in my trout I' ve got a stiff neck for hours, I thank you!
Listen dad, if you are gonna talk about naughty things in front of these American girls.
Then at least speak English, English.
Alright, my son.
Is this true?
What alone?
Indeed.
Remember Christmas dinner with the Scottish girl.
The insane one?
She was the wife of the dancer who lived upstairs.
A lawyer who became a policeman in a truck...????????????... Tea kettle!
Shat on a turtle!
We had some good times.
Welcome to 1975, Austin Powers, and fadjer.
Excuse me while I change, the hola boogie has made me sweaty.
You see Mr Powers.
I love gold.
The look of it, the taste of it, the smell of it, the texture
I love gold so much, that I even lost my genitalian in an unfortunate smelting accident.
Hence the name, Goldmember.
We' re both swingers you see.
You have a tight body.
You' re tight like a tiger.
Would you like a smoke and a pancake?
A smoke and a pancake.
Then there is no pleasing you.
That' s not right.
Hello, what have we here?
That' s a keeper, put it in the skin box please, with the others.
That' s just disgusting.
Save me from my self.
You' re insane Goldmember!
And "That' s the way aha aha I like it", "KC and the sunshine band".
Alright Goldmember, don' t play the laughing boy.
There are only 2 things I can' t stand in this world, people who are intolerant of other
What?
Take the fadjer away!
Dutch hater.
Dr. Evils orders.
Which for you is bad news, Bears, "Walter Matthau".
Up yours, jive turkey!
They’ re taking my father to the time machine.
Come on now.
That was close Foxy, I owe you one.
Austin, I found this in Goldmember' s office.
Smashing.
I wanna go to the future with you.
We can catch goldmember together.
I owe it to my partner.
I should warn you Foxy, 2002 is very different.
Well, the future better get ready for me.
Because I' m Foxy Cleopatra, and I' m a whole lot of woman.
2002, here we come.
"Georgia State Prison"
It' s your son.
He wants to take over the family business.
Scotty Does?
He' s gotten so evil he' s even started losing his hair.
He just wants to make you proud, Herr Doctor.
After all it' s hard on the boy not having a father.
You know, first you were frozen, then you were in space, now you' re in jail.
Don' t tell me he feels neglected.
You were adopted?
I never met my birth parents.
I' m told it was a beautiful Belgian day.
The smell of waffles and brussel sprouts filled the summer air until my birth mother was incinerated.
I only survived because her smoking carcass formed a protective cocoon of slaughtered human effluence.
They raised me to be evil.
But nothing compares to this.
Being inside the belly of the beast night after night all alone!
Daddies all pant up, let' s freak.
Times up.
"Visiting hours are over".
Move it.
Gentlemen, listen up you ’ all.
Here is the new plan.
And we' re going to walk out the front door.
Hey man, I know guys on crack that makes more sense then you.
Really?
Let me put it to you this way, coz.
Tonight 8 p. m You' re going to start a riot.
There you are, good morning sunshine.
Good morning.
Great.
Me too.
You' ve got mail.
So, what does this thing do?
Well, it' s called the internet, and it' s completely revolutionised
The way we live and access vital information.
For example, have a look at this.
Now that’ s vital information.
I know it' s amazing.
Basil, what' s happening baby?
A lot is happening Foxy.
Dr. Evil has escaped.
The good news is that one of our agents has managed to infiltrate Dr. Evil' s organisation.
Excellent Basil, we' ve been trying for years to get a mole inside Dr. Evil' s lair, we now have that mole.
Yes.
And here he is.
The most excellent agent we' ve ever seen.
Yes, the most excellent agent we' ve ever seen.
Thank you.
To a new lair outside Tokyo, Japan.
By the way, I realise that I have a large mole on my face.
Where?
Where' s that mole?
I didn' t see one.
I also realise the irony, that I am myself a mole.
No one would make that connection.
Anyway, well done old chap.
Nice to meet your mole.
Don' t say mole.
Stop.
- Mole.
Shut up!
"Tokyo Bay"
Up periscope.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my new submarine lair.
It' s long and hard and full of seamen.
Tough sub.
You look very tight.
Yes, you look like a "macho man", "Village People".
You know Goldmember, I don' t think that' s something one dude should say to another dude.
Yes this is a keeper.
Alright you' re not gonna put that skin in your mouth are you?
Okay, that' s just gross.
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know we' ve been designing a "tractor beam".
Code name Preparation H.
It' s powerful enough to pull the meteor "Midas 22" into a collision course with the earth.
Upon entering the atmosphere the hot boll of "magma" will strike and melt the polar ice caps, causing a global flood.
But enough of my technical mumbo jumbo allow me to demonstrate.
Lower the globe!
Scheisse, well congratulations numb nuts.
You have succeeded in turning me into a freakin jack in the box.
I' m okay, I' m okay.
Release the meteor.
God damn it!
Way to go a- hole!
Like try and find my balls for god sakes.
I' m ok.
Dr. Evil we still have the ultimate insurance policy.
May I present to you the very sexual, the very tight Austin Powers, fadjer.
His fadjer doctor Evil.
His fadjer?
Yeah Goldmember, I don' t speak freaky deeky Dutch, ok perv boy?
Fadjer is dad, dad is fadjer.
Yes, I would with that accent.
Nigel Powers.
Hello, hello.
Bring him to me.
Put the guns down.
Is this the first day on the job or something?
You attack me one at a time.
And I knock you out with a single punch.
Go.
Judo chop.
Do you know who I am?
Have you any idea how many anonymous hench men I have killed over the years?
You haven’ t even got a name tag.
You got no chance.
Why don' t you just fall down.
Alright, Dr Evil give yourself up while you still got a chance.
You got me.
Nigel Powers meet Mini- Me.
Blimey, I thought I smelled cabbage.
Take him away!
Dr Evil, can I paint his yoo- hoo gold?
How about no, you crazy Dutch bastard.
You know, I think it' s a shame the way they treat you.
Doesn' t mean you deserve 1/ 8th of their respect.
Say, Mini fella, I' m curious.
Is everything in proportion?
Let' s have a look.
My word, your a tripod.
It' s like a baby' s arm holding an apple.
The good new is if you ever get tired, you can use it as a kick stand.
I think we both know who the real brains is behind this operation.
Tokyo International Airport, Japan.
Tokyo a go- go baby, yeah.
What' s kicking Basil?
Austin.
One of Dr Evil' s henchmen
Has been spotted at the Asahi Sumo Arena.
Proceed there immediately.
Thanks Basil.
"Asahi Sumo Arena"
This diaper is making my nuts rub together.
It' s gonna start a fire
Sure ain' t.
Are we done here?
Something doesn’ t smell right.
And I think its Fat Bastard.
You ok, Austin?
Sound as a pound love.
I think I might have pinched one off to soon.
You really are a fat bastard.
You know that hurts my feelings.
I' ve tried going on a diet you know, the zoan.
Who' s your friend?
Do you find me sexy?
Shut your mouth.
Alright, that' s enough.
Ok, you got me, put it there.
My titties, you gave me a ner- pull.
I' ve got you now.
Prepare for the ultimate wire- fighting manoeuvre.
I just hope my wire- fighting team is ready!
Oh great, isn' t this magical.
One of my wire' s broke.
You under arrest, sugar.
Okay, Fat Bastard, who' s the Japanese cat you made an exchange with?
His name is Roboto.
He owns Roboto industries.
The tractor beam.
Do you honestly think that crime can pay?
I really take my sumo wrestling seriously you know.
But when you' re an over weight child in a society that demands perfection.
Hey Scotty.
How you been sport?
I got you a present.
Really?
Open the tank.
Are those sharks with laser beams attached to their heads?
You mean I actually have freakin sharks with freakin laser beams attached to their freakin heads?
You' re the best evil son an evil dad could ever ask for.
I love you son.
Touching moment.
Scotty, come here.
Pop a squat right next to daddy.
Mini- Me, move down the bench.
Scotty’ s on fire.
Alright, it' s getting crowded in here.
Everyone out, everyone out.
Not you Scotty.
Not you number 2.
Not you henchman holding wrench.
This is uncomfortable.
He' s small.
We' ve confirmed what Fat Bastard told you about Roboto is accurate.
He was hired by Dr Evil to construct "Preparation H".
So Roboto had the technology to build Goldmember' s tractor beam.
Which means Roboto will lead us to Goldmember.
Which means Goldmember will lead us to my father.
"Roboto Industries Tokyo Headquarters"
I am president of Roboto Industries.
My name is Mr Roboto.
Thank you Mr Roboto.
I thank you.
Thank you for seeing us on such short notice.
You speak Japanese?
I' m looking for my father.
He was kidnapped.
Please eat some shit.
Please eat what?
He said, Please eat some shitake mushrooms.
Tell me what do you know about my fathers where abouts?
Your ass is happy?
He said, Your assignment is an unhappy one.
I have a huge rod
I have a huge rodent problem.
A little off the topic, but unfortunate nonetheless.
Yes, quite off topic, thank you very much.
Why don' t I just speak in English?
That would be a good idea, now wouldn' t it?
That way I wouldn' t miss read the subtitles making it seem like you’ re saying things that are dirty.
I' m sorry to hear about your father.
Please excuse me.
I have another appointment.
By the way I do have a huge rod...
Tell me something I don' t know.
Say what?
My Spider sense is telling me that my father is still in this building.
You keep a look out.
Austin Powers is on the premises.
Yes sir
Keep a look out for Austin Powers.
Come here and look at this.
Is he doing what I think he' s doing?
There’ s Goldmember and Roboto.
You need this to tone the tractor beam.
Hands up Goldmember!
It' s payback time.
Sure you can kill me.
But then what happens to Austin Powers fadjer?
And now he' s going to have an unfortunate smelting accident.
Don' t worry dad, I' m here to rescue you.
Now you' re trying to rescue me instead of stopping Goldmember.
Please I' m not gonna let Goldmember get away.
Austin, goldmember is getting away.
Hello, hello, aren' t you gonna introduce us Austin?
Nigel Powers.
Is that Ouder Floers you' re wearing?
Yes, it is.
That' s how a woman should smell.
My, my even in the face of danger you live up to you’ re reputation.
Your spy car is a mini?
It' s not the size mate.
It' s how you use it.
I saved your life.
You should have done your job!
Shut up and turn around please!
It' s Godzilla!
It looks like Godzilla, but duo to international copyright laws it' s not.
Though it isn' t.
Now what?
I think it' s obvious, we should take Dr Evil' s lair by force.
Back up?
Well that’ s fairly condescending.
Well, I don' t like to use gadgets.
You know, I think being frozen damaged your brain.
And how would you know?
What are you saying son?
What about your Swedish nanny Helga?
Let' s say I didn' t hire her for the cooking.
We were mates you and I.
I needed a father.
Do you know I risked my life trying to save you.
If you got an issue, here' s a tissue
That is not funny.
Well, I suppose we better go our separate ways then.
"Austin' s Tokyo Hotel"
So I' ve been assigned to welcome you to the ministry of defence.
I, can' t wait to inform Austin of your defection.
Austin should be here any second.
Try to kill me, will ya?
You wanna be friends?
I' m not falling for that again.
And that' s why he decided to help us.
I' m sure Austin and Mini- Me will get along famously.
I guarantee nothing will happen to Mini- Me on my watch.
Austin, there you are.
Mini- Me has switched sides.
Sorry about that old chap.
Welcome aboard.
Bloody Mole!
So you' ve decided to join us Mini- Me?
And thank you for the map of Dr Evil' s sub.
You are so beautiful.
Are you a clone of an angel?
That is so sweet.
Are you sure you don' t have a little clone in you?
That is so not funny.
Okay everyone, prepare to dive.
This spy car is also a submarine.
Get me the world organisation!
Gentlemen, in a matter of hours a meteor will crash into earth causing a global flood.
That is of course unless you pay me 1 billion, zillion... yen.
Perhaps you' d like a demonstration?
One of our satellites has fallen out of orbit.
It' s the one that looks like a pair of...
Melons!
Are they nice and firm?
Look at that.
Any sign of that satellite?
No sir, it' s gone.
Cool baby, you look very switched on.
Thank you Austin.
Dr Evil, in light of the success of the device, it is Japanese custom that I receive a bonus.
You' re not joking?
No, in fact, if you don' t give me the bonus...
Won' t you let me take care of this?
He' s got a good Evil laugh.
Scotty!
We' il need to disguise.
There' s only one uniform.
Hey there buddy, how’ s it going?
Sorry about that.
It' s a good hat.
Come on Mini- Me, let' s go.
Hold it right there mister.
Did you really think you could get away with this?
I did actually yes.
Every new recruit must have a physical.
Now get in here sailor.
Alright sailor, go behind that screen and strip down to your underwear.
Alright then I' il just go to that screen.
Come on, hurry the map.
I' m going to need a urine sample.
Mini- Me our shadows. we' re casting a shadow.
What' s wrong sailor?
You should check that guy out.
What the hell' s going on in here?
Hands up.
You heard me, I said hands up.
Both of you
Mini- Me, the map!
Go!
Okay, you got me.
Are you alright little man?
Before I kill you, perhaps you' d like to see the genius of my plan.
Where?
Looking for this?
Mini- Me?
Alright, everyone drop your guns, because Foxxy Cleopatra' s in the sub.
Alright Dr Evil.
It' s finally come down to this.
You, me and a gun.
What are you going to do now Austin?
What are you doing here?
I' ve got to finish this up once and for all.
I' m afraid you can' t do that.
Dad, I' m fine.
I' m not talking about you.
I' m talking about him.
Dr Evil is not your son.
You both are.
What?
It was our first family holiday together.
Just as I was finishing a case
Your mother brought the two of you to Belgium.
I stopped to have a tinkle
But my parents died in a car accident.
It was no accident.
It was an assassination attempt.
I thought only Austin survived.
I should have told you the truth earlier.
They made you so damn evil.
Very interesting story, Mr Powers.
Of course I' m gonna have to wait until I see all the facts.
Daddy!
Daddy' s here, Doggy.
Dad, what' s going on?
What are you going to do Austin?
Are you sure you can trust Dr Evil?
He ain' t heavy, he' s my brother baby, yeah.
I should' ve told you this so long ago son.
I' m very proud of you.
Can you forgive me?
Come on, first I' m not evil enough for you.
And now you' re gonna turn good?
Listen Scott.
Believe me.
But at the end of the day, you' ve just got do it for yourself, baby.
What?
I hate you.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I don' t even know you, but I hate you to.
And I especially hate you!
You' il pay!
You' il all pay!
I' d like to point out that no one else in my gen pool runs like a girl.
You might not want to destroy the world.
I' m going to flood the earth!
Think again Goldmember.
Foxxy Cleopatra.
It' s a shame I had to kill your partner.
Too bad for me?
How about too bad for you.
Luckily I keep a spare.
Look everyone, my winky was a key.
Only a bloody Dutchman.
Foxxy, I' m coming!
Nobody try anything stupid, or the shooting begins.
I' il stay here and be your back up.
Doggy, what do we do?
Think!
I could re- rout the output capacitor to the tractor beam
Come on, let' s go.
The shooting begins.
I used to think you were crazy.
But now I can see you' re nuts.
Well done Austin.
He has saved the world again.
We did it.
Yeah baby!
Just trying it on.
Goldmember, you under arrest, sugar!
Hey, assholes, do I have time for a smoke and a pancake or what?
I' m from Holland, isn' t that weird.
But you' re not fat anymore.
I went on a subway diet.
I' ve lost 180 pounds.
Congratulations baby.
Thank you.
I do have a little bit of access skin though.
And unfortunately my neck does look like a vagina.
Austin, thank you for everything.
I' m gonna get you, Austin Powers!
- I' m Mr. Kill.
- Now there' s a name to die for.
521 km/ h!
That' s a new personal best, Boss.
Thruster 2 cut out again.
Get it fixed, will you.
Glad you could make it, Mr. Bond.
- How did you like my run?
- Looked like a man on the edge of losing control.
It' s only by being on the edge that we know who we really are...... under the skin.
Take your Donald Campbell, 1967, the Bluebird, water speed record.
- Campbell died on his return run.
- Yes, but he died chasing a dream.
- Isn' t that way to go?
- I' d rather not go at all.
I see you don' t chase dreams, you live them.
One of the virtues of never sleeping, Mr. Bond.
I have to live my dreams.
Besides, plenty of time to sleep when you' re dead.
- Mr. Bond.
- Oh, miss Frost.
I' il show you your room.
A palace of ice.
You must feel right at home.
This whole place was built for tonight' s demonstration.
I' m told the human element necessitates... a precise balance of heat and cold.
Built on a lake?
I hope Graves got things right.
- And what' s the little property I noticed next door?
- The diamond mine... and Gustav' s living quarters.
Thank you.
This is you.
Wonderful
Would you like to show me more?
Vodka Martini, plenty of ice if you can spare it.
James!
Or for the view again?
Right now I' m only interested in endangered species.
Oh well, does that include me?
Depends what you' re up to this time.
So I left you in an explosive situation, you' re a big boy, figured you could handle yourself.
No wonder your relationships don' t last.
I' m a girl who just doesn' t like to get tied down.
You' re still feeling the side effects?
The insomnia is permanent for me.
An hour in the dream machine keeps me sane.
What happened to you?
- Bond.
- He knows nothing.
I' ve been this close to him and he still didn' t know who I really was.
You saw my father after you were exchanged?
Yes.
General Moon still mourns your death.
My death.
Mr. Bond.
And miss...
Swift, "Space and Technology Magazine".
I take it Mr. Bond has been explaining his "Big Bang" theory.
Oh yes, I think I got the... thrust of it.
I see.
The demonstration is about to begin in five minutes.
Shall we?
Shall we?
- Not Jinx any more?
- I' il always be a jinx to you.
I' m always trying to give the planet something in return for what it has given me.
Those little shards of heaven, known as diamonds.
They are the stuff of dreams.
And a means to make dreams real.
Imagine.. being able to bring light and warmth to the darkest parts of the world.
Imagine being able to grow crops the year round, bringing an end to hunger.
A second sun, shining like a diamond in the sky.
Let there be light.
I give you Icarus.
It' s miraculous silver skin will inhale the sun' s light and breathe it gently upon the earth' s surface.
You have no idea, how much Icarus is about to change your world.
And now let us brighten this night with our inner radiance.
Show me the modifications.
Yes.
Here is the self- defense mechanism you asked me to build in.
- 50, 000 volts?
Armed...... and very dangerous.
Hands up.
"M" warned me this would happen.
That' s why you tried so hard not to be interested in me.
Oh God, you' re even worse than your file says.
You don' t look too convinced.
Come on, put your back into it, eh?
Remember I know all about you, 007.
Sex for dinner, death for breakfast, well it' s not gonna work with me.
- No?
- You' re getting good at this.
Are we still being watched?
- No, they left ages ago.
- Oh God, you are impossible.
Come on, let' s get out of here.
You better stay here tonight.
- Keep up the charade of being lovers.
I must say I admire your restraint.
You were here full two hours before anything blew up.
The way you' re going will get us both killed.
James, tell me what really happened in North Korea.
I was betrayed.
That was all.
Occupational hazard.
- This is crazy, you' re a 00.
- It' s only a number.
James...
Be careful.
Go back to your room.
Why do you want to kill me?
I thought it was the humane thing to do.
Who sent you?
Your mama.
She told me to tell you she' s really disappointed in you.
I' il let you in on a little secret.
This mine is fake.
But the lasers...... are real.
She won' t talk.
- Let' s make it permanent.
- I' il use the laser.
Don' t leave a mess.
- Jinx?
- James, turn it off!
James!
I could use a little help here!
Switch it off!
Or I will be half the girl I used to be.
So that' s the girl who hates to be tied down, eh?
Are you gonna get me off this thing?
- What are you?
- NSA.
- Hello, we' re on the same side.
- Doesn' t mean we' re after the same thing.
Sure it does...
World peace, unconditional love, and your little friend with the expensive acne.
- Zao?
- Yes, Zao.
He' s back there with some weird psychedelic light mask.
Probably brought it from the clinic in Cuba.
He couldn' t have brought it.
It was already here.
It belongs to another Korean.
His boss.
I think we need Kill to give us a hand to get out of here.
I got a better idea.
- I' m going back up.
- Wait...
Go to Miranda first, she is Ml6.
- Warn her to get out.
- And what are you going to do?
Unfinished business.
So you live to die another day.
- Colonel.
- At last.
- I was beginning to think you' d never guess.
- Was it painful?
- The gene therapy.
- You couldn' t possibly imagine.
Oh, good.
- I' m glad to hear that.
Like watching you float around in your ignorance.
Granting you life day by day just to see if you get wise.
It' s been fun.
Well the fun is about to come to a dead end.
We only met briefly, you and I.
But you left a lasting impression.
You see, when your intervention forced me to present the world with a new face...
I chose to model the disgusting Gustav Graves on you, adjusting the details.
That unjustifiable swagger, your crass quips, a defense mechanism concealing such inadequacy.
My defense mechanism is right here.
So.. miss Frost isn' t all she seems.
Looks can be deceptive.
Yes
By the way, did you find out who betrayed you in North Korea?
Only a matter of time.
You never thought of looking inside your own organization.
She was right under your nose.
It was so good of you to bring your gun to bed with us.
Yes.. occupational hazard.
You see, I have a gift.
An instinct for sensing people' s weaknesses.
Yours is women.
Hers and mine is winning whatever the cost.
I won myself my very own Ml6 agent.
Using everything at my own disposal.
Her brains, her talent,... even her sex.
The coldest weapon of all.
Hello.
Miranda?
There will be others after me.
You know that.
Oh you mean your American friend, Jinx.
Soon to be victim of a tragedy.
An ice palace can be such a treacherous place.
Hand over the toys.
You know, I' ve missed your sparkling personality.
- How' s that for a punch line?
I enjoyed last night, James.
But it really is death for breakfast.
Kill him.
- He got away.
- No matter.
The pleasure of the kill is in the chase..
Bring me the generals.
Gentlemen, I promised you a demonstration.
Now you will see the true power of Icarus.
A western spy runs but he cannot hide.
Icarus will lock on to the heath signature, and concentrate the sun' s power.
Hey boss.
He beat your time.
Time to draw the line.
Global warming is a terrible thing.
Nice moves.
Just like Bond.
He was pretty vigorous last night as well.
He did you?
I didn' t know he was that desperate.
Well, he' s not coming back for you.
Just died, running, trying to save his own skin.
It' s pretty good tailoring.
I hope it doesn' t shrink when it gets wet.
You’ ve got one hour to wrap this up.
Let' s move.
Where are you?
All units report.
Now!
Adaptive camouflage failure.
Time to give the American her bath.
Adaptive camouflage restored.
Vlad, does the word ergonomics mean anything to you?
Man, machine...
This... is still a suitcase.
Finish it, will you.
Come now, it' s warm in here.
The cold kept you alive.
What took you so long?
Agent Johnson.
- James.
- Charles.
Okay, bring us up to speed on this.
Another lost division' s been demobilized north of the DMC.
- That is 80, 000 troops and counting.
- And another million in reserve.
Moon' s father won' t let this turn into a war.
General Moon is under arrest.
The hardliners staged a coup last night.
If you' d told us about your agent in the Cuban clinic...
She would be dead already.
Your mole would have made sure of that.
We wouldn' t have had a mole at all if you had disclosed the fact... that miss Frost and Moon were on the Harvard fencing team together.
Knowing who to trust is everything in this business.
Well, well, James Bond.
Just in time for the fireworks.
Let' s get down to business.
We are at DEFCON 2.
You don' t just stroll through the world' s biggest mine field.
You need some kind of an edge...... Icarus.
We' re taking care of that.. with an A- SAT launch, in one hour.
- Where is Graves?
- In the middle of a North Korean air base.
- Right where we can' t touch him.
But I can.
Look, we' re here in case things escalate.
Not to make sure that they do.
No incursions into the North.
The President gave me a direct order.
And when did that ever stop you?
You make your own decisions.
I' m sending in 007.
You think I' d leave this in the hands of the British?
You go with him.
Ok, let' s go!
They have entered North Korean air space.
Relax, Robinson.
If our radar can' t see those Switch Blades,... the North Koreans sure as hell can' t.
Hey boss.
They have launched against Icarus.
Leave it on automatic.
I hope nobody here is superstitious,...... that' s one big mirror we' re about to break.
My God!
Mobilize the South Korean troops.
And give me the President, now!
Still no news about Bond?
Vehicles.
Some big shots...
It' s him
300 meters.
Windage 1/ 2.
We gotta get on that plane.
You!
Have my father brought down.
I don' t know you.
You' ve always found it difficult to accept me.
I never forgot what you taught me.
In war the victorious strategist only seeks battle...... after the victory has been won.
I remember my art of war.
And this is what guarantees that victory.
My son.
What have you done to yourself?
Come father.
Watch the rising of your son.
The second that thing hits the 38th parallel we' re gonna hit them with everything we’ ve got.
That may not be enough.
Do you see, father?
Icarus is clearing the mine field creating a highway for our troops.
If the Americans don' t run, Icarus will destroy them.
Japan is a bug waiting to be squashed.
And the West will shake with fear.
- The Americans will send nuclear warheads!
- Icarus will swat them from the sky.
You will destroy us.
- You would kill your own son?
- The son I knew died long ago.
Caution!
Caution!
Manual!
I got it.
My, my.. you get around.
Left hand!
That' s it...
Now drop it!
Looks like your friends have bailed.
Push on Autopilot.
Come on.
That' s it.
I' il have to try something more to the point.
One thousand meters and closing.
I can read your every move.
Read this.
Bitch!
Oh look!
Parachutes for both of us!
Oops.. not anymore.
You see, Mr. Bond.. you can' t kill my dreams.
But my dreams can kill you.
Time to face destiny.
Time to face gravity.
I think I broke her heart.
Looks like we' re going down together.
Not yet.
Get the back open!
Okay.
I told you I was a jinx!
I should have warned you.
- At least we' re gonna die rich!
Come on.
You said something about going down together?
Moneypenny?!
I was um...... just testing it out!
It' s rather hard, isn' t it?
Yes.. very!
Wait, don' t pull it out!
See?
It' s a perfect fit.
Leave it in.
It' s gonna come out sooner or later.
No, leave it in, please.... a few more minutes.
We really have to get these back.
Still the good guys, huh?
I' m still not quite sure... how good you are.
I' m so good...
Especially when you' re bad!
Ja, all this is under control.
A hundred and fifty million dollars and my dope is on the way.
Today is gonna be a good day.
We are 25 degrees north, 84 degrees west.
The cargo' s being dropped.
Good.
- Yeah.
Bang.
Sorry, Johnny.
Fucking bitches.
Infrared' s got a live one on the water.
Air Force Stallion C- 1 4 to Coast Guard.
We' ve got a fast- moving contact heading 3- 5- 0 toward South Florida.
Captain, Air Force Stallion has a contact at 1 - 8- 0 closing fast.
Vessel off our port bow, this is U. S. Coast Guard.
Intercept is 1 - 8- 0, speed 1 7 knots.
Make it so, chief.
Scramble the helo.
Request to know your intentions at this time.
Incoming.
Negative contact with target.
Over.
Captain, we' ve lost target.
Here' s your delivery and payment.
Is it done?
- Okay.
All right, TNT, for the millionth time, listen up.
Since 9- 1 1, we' ve gone hi- tech over water.
Our source says the biggest X shipment on record arrives tonight...... and we want to know who' s behind it.
Hopefully in a few hours we' il have our answer.
We' il hit from three directions:
We' il go in with a water team, vehicle assault and we got guys on foot.
We cannot make a move until our UCs have ID' d the drugs and called us in.
No call, we back away.
And these guys we' re going after...... they got a lot of firepower and they hate the law.
So eyes open out there.
Here comes the drop.
Fuck.
My lens is flaring.
I can' t see shit.
Brothers!
Gather around!
- Why didn' t you say there was a rally?
- Who' s looking?
- Shit.
- White power!
- White power!
- White power!
Miami PD.
Aw, damn.
It' s the Negroes.
Casper, drop the bag.
Alpha leader, bring them in.
What you gonna do When we come for you?
- Dude, you gotta learn the words.
Alpha leader, hit it.
Repeat your transmission.
Alpha leader to Bravo Four, please continue relay.
Where' s backup?
Hit it.
- Mike, I' m only getting static.
The radios are fucked.
Something funny?
- Mike, where are they?
Got you, nigger.
- Looks like we got us a situation here.
- You won' t shoot.
That' s what I think.
My partner came here tonight prepared to die.
Incinerating trash like you.
Ready to die, right, Marcus?
- The fuck I want to do that for?
A:
Or B:
Keep acting all Brody and I' il put one in your chest.
You know, take the time to talk a minute.
You know, de- escalate the situation.
I actually prefer shooting motherfuckers.
A lot of movement going on.
Can' t see the UCs.
- I think something' s going down.
- Don' t move yet.
Mike, the man has a gun to my head.
He' il put it down if a hollow point' s in his eye!
- Damn.
Now, was that necessary, sir?
- See?
He got to be a nigga too?
- Calm down.
- Calm down?
I' m calm.
I' m calm!
Stop all the goddamned movement!
Everybody stop moving!
We can' t let you all go, but this shit' il get worked out in court.
We got our rights.
I' m all right.
It' s the best I can do for all of youse!
- You got 3 seconds to drop your gun.
- One.
Just to wake up to pop one in a motherfucker!
- Two!
Rock 'n' roll!
Let' s go!
Kill them cops!
Marcus!
Go!
- Drop the...!
- Get your hands up.
The radios were fucked up.
Get some medics over here.
You guys okay?
- What you mean, "we"?
Motherfucker shot me in the ass, man.
That "who" would be you.
- Me?
I shot you?
- Yeah.
But I ain' t saying I shot you in the ass.
Tell me about it.
- Yo, man, how' s it feel?
I can smell my ass burning.
Mike, you should give it a little kiss so it' il feel better.
Pretend like we' re not even here.
Hey, isn' t Ricky Martin having a concert?
Get the fuck on.
- You always gotta go racial, man.
- It' s sad, man.
It ain' t nowhere near the hole.
Two lousy bags?
What about the biggest shipment of ecstasy to come out of Amsterdam?
Let me worry about my snitch, all right?
It' s a lot of cop work for nothing!
Take your ass home somewhere.
Tonight la policia jacked my mules.
Who can tell me how those jackals knew where to bite Johnny Tapia?
Speak up, cousins.
You' re lucky they did not find my drugs on Dixie 7.
Change the boat schedule.
We got a shipment Thursday.
Change it after.
Just keep them guessing.
You know, unlike you, my daddy didn' t leave me no trust fund.
I got real- world shit to deal with, Mike.
I' m not in it for the thrills.
Same old shit, different day.
All right, yes, damn.
I shot you, all right?
But you' d be seeing nothing at all if I hadn' t made my move.
I don' t know why you acting so angry.
I' m not angry.
- No, you' re very angry.
No, I' m not angry.
You are angry.
It' s okay.
I' m not angry.
That shit' s fucking annoying.
Like a fucking gnat at a barbecue.
Good.
I want you to say:
It' s okay.
I love myself.
Whoosah. "
I don' t know what the fuck you mean.
Yes, you do know what the fuck I mean.
You' re the one that needs therapy.
- When?
Capt. Howard made me do it after I shot them people at the airport.
Whoosah.
Whoosah!
- Papi.
That' s "daddy," right?
- Yeah.
Whoosah.
Mike, you go to therapy to get your issues worked out...... not bang your therapist.
- See, now you just talking nasty.
I gotta start loving me for me.
That sound like that group thing.
Maybe I did the group thing once or twice.
Whoosah.
- Whoosah.
A bunch of men hugging and kissing, that' s some cult shit.
Ignore him, doc, he' s blowing this out of proportion.
My ass is what' s out of proportion, Mike, okay?
I got a big chunk missing.
It' s actually a small chunk.
Maybe there ain' t gonna be no long run.
Whatever.
I mean...
- Icepick, Lowrey.
- Hey, brother.
Two bags?
You embarrassed me in front of my people.
Wait, brother.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You better pray to whoever it is you pray to...... because you got 2 4 hours to find that X before I find you.
The cops hit my mule.
Well, Mr. Tapia, I don' t know where the heat is coming from.
It' s a delicate situation for both of us, isn' t it?
- I' m telling you, I' ve checked them.
A guy' s OD' ing.
Some fucking punk thinks he can die in my club.
Ecstasy fucks them up.
- Get him out of here, Josef.
- We' il dump him around the block.
Dump him.
Young, single, living in New York.
- Just like Sex and the City.
- Theresa, cancel the damn cable.
So, Auntie Syd, you' re a cop too, huh?
I work for the DEA, but I just push a lot of papers.
Don' t have to worry about my little sister fighting crime.
Damn bolts.
He' s being mean because he got injured.
- Are you okay?
It' s...... other things that were affected.
- What?
You...
It' s just nerve damage, that' s all.
I' il talk to you about it.
I got it from a maternity store.
It take pressure off the other cheek.
- For you, dog.
- Thoughtful.
Look, man...... last night there was something different in your eyes.
You know, Mike, I had an epiphany.
You know?
- I realized you' re an enigma.
- Yeah, I could see that.
But guess what?
No.
Whoosah.
Is that Syd?
- Now' s not a good time.
No throwing balls in the house.
Whoosah.
- Hey.
Aw, they ain' t tell me it was a luau.
Hold on.
Hey, hold up.
Look at you.
I see now.
You didn' t tell Marcus about New York.
- He knows about New York.
- About us?
You told him about us?
No, he knows about New York.
You know, it' s a nice city and that I dropped a witness off last month.
Mike is so sweet.
- So sweet he make your teeth rot.
- So have you told him yet?
Real soon.
He needs to know you' re transferring and won' t be his partner anymore.
Theresa, timing is everything.
Marcus is not very happy with me right now.
No, no, Syd, I' m telling you, that is Scarface limping around in there.
We need to give that boy a few minutes to let his butt heal up good.
We like each other.
What' s the big deal?
I' m just gonna go tell him right now, because this is dumb.
I' m gonna tell him.
How am I not tell him?
- I need a minute.
We' re not vibing right now.
Mike, he' s my brother, okay?
Toughen up, chief.
Hey, I ain' t say I was scared.
There' s something wrong with your brother.
So, Mike, I understand you were in New York last month.
- Remember I did the thing?
The two of you should' ve gotten together.
I never told you Mike was in New York.
Well, you know what, Mike?
Why don' t you show her around?
That' d be nice.
That would be so great.
Well, me and...
Yeah, because I' m in town on vacation.
Oh, my God.
We got a pool right here.
That ain' t exactly a pool, man.
That' s like a big- ass puddle wrapped in blue plastic.
Didn' t they have any good pools when you bought this one?
Megan, that pool cost $3900.
Okay, so how much do the good pools cost?
- It' s all right, baby.
- It is kind of whack, huh?
I gotta go meet somebody.
It was nice seeing you again, Mike.
Nice...
Where you going?
I thought you were on vacation.
So glad you could join us, Mike.
I' m telling you, spending time like this make a partnership strong.
Mike, can I see you by my stupid pool?
What' s the deal, baby?
Why you gotta always come over here and try to take over, Mike?
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?
Are you taking medication?
You taking medicine for the thing, right?
- What' d I do?
Just forget it.
Go fetch.
Now, that shit is funny.
That' s some funny shit.
Yo, Lowrey, you hot.
Thirty- nine hundred dollars.
You better pray to God you right this time.
Icepick said the Haitian Zoepounds about to do a rip.
Let' s move.
Talk to me.
Eyes on, agents.
This is 1 05.
They' re backing in.
I got a good look.
- We got a good eyeball.
- All right, we' re in.
What' s up?
You did some good jobs for our Russian crew up there.
How old are you?
Old enough.
If you want to move this stuff you gotta do it quick.
Wow, nice getup.
I' d like to see how your machine works.
Ooh, that sounded dirty.
"I would like to see how your machine works, baby."
I mean, I' m more of a refined kind of a human being.
You follow ballet?
Three of my cousins are dancing with the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow.
I like hippie- hop too.
I gave you 5000.
You gave me 4900.
- I gave you 5000.
- 4900.
- 5000.
If you want to fuck with me again, find yourself another chump.
Okay.
- How much?
- Three.
Look at this.
Clean it up.
Okay, we want to change a little over $3 million, all right?
How many jobs did you do with my friends up there in New York?
Quite a few.
How you behave with me has consequences for a lot of people.
You found me, not the other way around.
You need me to change small bills to large ones and deliver to a third party.
I bet he' d like his money in a timely fashion.
Delivery' s late, it' s your ass, not mine.
Here' s 50, 000 in 1 00s for your 50, 000 in 1 0s.
Third party takes his million in these five briefcases here.
- I hope I' m not losing you, chief.
So for your $3 million that we shrunk for you...... you get 2 million in clean money back.
- I' il be delivering these to your dealer.
- What?
- We' re giving too fucking much away.
We take all the risk.
And our suppliers take too much of our profit.
Yeah, we' il call the general, renegotiate.
He' s a businessman, we' re businessmen.
Yeah, call him.
You call.
Agents, we' re on the move to the money drop.
Hey, man, the truck' s leaving.
Don' t lose that truck.
Follow that truck.
Look like Icepick came through.
Wonder whose shit they about to rip now?
Falcon One, do you see her?
Stand by.
I don' t want to get spotted, take a burn.
Zoepound a bunch of pirates, man.
Roberto, she' s coming to you.
I got her.
This is Falcon One, guys.
Heads up, guys.
Looks to be three black male occupants.
It' s out of our field of vision.
All right, be aware, we got three bogeys unidentified.
They' re moving.
Shit.
- Fuck, it' s a hit!
Agent down.
Roberto, fucking follow them!
I' m on it!
Stay here!
Son of a bitch!
It' s Syd!
Move!
Man, what is your sister into?
Sidewalk!
- I need backup on Canal, now!
You just get ready to shoot.
Police!
Stop the car!
Man, your badge?!
Shoot him!
Mike, she' s in trouble, man.
Get out of the way!
I think I done just got mad.
Gun!
- Hold on.
Now show them your badge!
- This shit is crazy.
- I know, right?
Move!
Get the world down here!
Go!
Get out!
You, drive!
Go!
Punch that shit!
Kill the fucker!
Shit!
Move!
- This is what I do!
Shit!
Oh, man, my headlight.
Shoot!
What are you doing, man?
- That' s my bad.
- Shoot outside!
Pay attention to what you' re doing.
These dudes is off the chain!
Fuck!
- This is some sick shit!
- Yep, it' s about to get sicker.
Watch out!
Oh, sh...!
- Oh, they are not about to do that.
- Hell, yes, they are!
- You see that?!
How can I not?!
- You know what' d be fucking helpful?
Just shut the fuck up and let me drive!
Let' s try that!
Hey, come on, man, with the screaming shit!
I' m concentrating on dodging these fuckers.
Just relax.
- That was a flip!
- That motherfucker flipped!
- That one puckered up my butthole.
- Almost fucking crushed my head.
The boat!
I lost them.
Yeah, I' ve got your cargo to the backup drop point.
Attention all units, suspects still at large.
There she is.
What the fuck is going on, Syd?
Some desk you' re driving.
Get over here, I' m undercover.
I got DEA watching my back, so don' t blow my case.
- We saved your life.
- And I appreciate that.
What I don' t appreciate is you two following me here...... nearly burning a case that took five months to set up.
Is that what we do?
- What do you want me to do?
- Fuck that, Mike, she' s wrong.
Relax.
Syd, are there drugs in that truck?
- There' s cash.
- Where' s it going?
- I can' t tell you that.
Because I have a career and if I want to keep it, I have rules to follow.
What' s that mean?
My orders are, under no circumstances share information with Miami PD...... because they got too many leaks.
I' m Miami PD now?
You done forgot I' m your big brother, huh?
You know what, Syd, that shit you did was reckless...... it was stupid and it was dangerous.
I' m telling Mommy.
I' m definitely leaking that shit.
Hey, Marcus...
Syd, come on, he got a point.
Your brother loves you.
Not to mention a little thing called professional courtesy.
You bouncing in somebody' s yard, you should let them know about it.
First time using your gun?
Hey, you handled yourself very well.
Too bad your partner didn' t notice.
Thanks.
Think you get off that easy?
You been working this for five months?
How come you ain' t tell me in New York?
- What would you have said?
I' d have let you know this job is rugged, you know.
And if something happen to you I might...
Exactly why I didn' t say anything.
Somebody' s stealing your money.
I gotta go.
Thanks.
We gotta close this case before it get her killed.
Yeah, no doubt.
You ready to go back to the station, get our asses whupped?
I think we gonna be all right.
What' s your job description?
No, you two.
I' il tell you.
TNT:
Tactical Narcotics Team.
Keyword: "tactical."
"Displaying finesse and subtlety in achieving a goal!"
Tell me, gentlemen...... what was subtle about your work today?
Twenty- two cars...... and a boat, totaled?
How did you sink a boat?
We didn' t sink it.
Whoosah.
Thank God no cops died.
I got a police commissioner so far up my ass...... if he spits it' s coming out of my mouth.
But I know that there' s always two sides to a story.
So, what' s yours?
Well, I was at a family barbecue.
We got a tip that the Zoepounders...... were gonna do a hit on cash or drugs from this big- time X- Man.
That' s what they call a ecstasy dealer on the streets.
It' s cool.
No drugs.
Oh, okay.
How about the money?
- No money.
Then who is this X- Man?
So I...
We don' t know, but we are going to find out.
Well, then all that...... was for nothing?
Hold up.
There' s DEA all over.
Wait, the...
Wait, hold up.
The DEA?
Without consulting me?!
That' s a DEA car right there.
Christ!
Cap.
No.
Remember your pressure points.
My exercises.
- Whoosah.
Twenty- one thousand?
Oh, kiss my black ass.
It was the dashboard.
- You know what?
Yeah, you' il get your money.
Somebody' s on they way with your money.
Is it possible we could discuss potential reimbursement...
That' s why we drive police cars.
So where do we go from here?
We find the cash, we find the X- Man.
Hey, I' m through playing games, all right?
I got kids dying on my streets from souped- up X.
I do not want these animals taking over my city.
Do you understand?
So I want you guys to do whatever you do, whatever it takes, but do it now.
It' s not good, boss.
Oh, my God.
Fucking ratones eating my fucking money.
Carlos, this is a stupid fucking problem to have.
But it is a problem nonetheless.
Rat fuckers.
This black chica working for the Russians was a maniac lunatic.
She wasted some Haitians and got the load to the drop.
- Yeah.
No.
Just fly the drugs in and ship the money out.
Now American security' s so goddamned tight over the water...... and in the sky...... that the rats eat my money before I can get it to Cuba.
I can' t even get my money across town without making the news.
Hey, man.
Man.
Tell me...... should I be worried?
- No, boss.
- Shut the fuck up.
People is trying to jack my loads here in Miami.
I own this fucking town.
This is my town.
Pink, niña, pink.
Pink is prettier.
You' re lucky your mother was my mother' s cousins.
You look more like an angel.
- What do you think, Carlos?
- Of course.
- Roberto, what do you think?
Talk polite in front of my little bonbon...... or I' m gonna chop your balls off.
But I need to know if a crackhead rolls to me with a. 9, you' il cook that fool.
No question about it.
Shoot him in the leg.
Come on with that leg shit.
- Everybody deserves a little dignity.
- What about my dignity?
I' il be in a body bag.
- So sad.
- What' s so sad?
Your untreated control issues.
It' s not your fault.
What in the hell is that supposed to mean?
Got your gun, little tight T- shirt...... and became a overcompensating tough guy.
That is the last time you will ever refer to my mother' s titties.
I don' t even want them up in your head.
You know, I said all that, Mike, and all you heard was "titties."
Man, you can' t keep suppressing my spiritual growth, Mike.
You need to suppress my mother' s titties out of your psychoanalysis.
You just remember one thing, my friend.
I may not always be here.
What' s up, Icepick?
Jesus is the way, my brothers.
You just went number one on Uncle Mike' s shit list.
- We got two lousy bags, man.
- My brothers.
Haitian blond with dreads.
Blondie Dread?
He' s very expensive.
You and you have to do something for me.
Oh, you trying to get gangster on me like that?
- So we should probably...
Me and my partner, we' re on the Miami PD tandem dance team.
We thinking about going national.
You want to show him some of the routine?
Warm it up.
This the shit right here.
- What you doing to my shop?!
Wait.
- What are you doing?!
- Oh, give me some.
Stop!
- Do the dance thing.
- I' m gonna bring the house down.
Stop!
He lives in a pink house eight blocks from here on Carl Street.
Get down.
- Police!
Who that?
Who in my house?!
- I' m the devil, who' s asking?!
- The devil is not welcome here!
You got to call yourself the devil in his house?!
Shit!
You' re in my house!
This is all your fault!
- You' re in my country, though.
- Fuck you, how' s that?
- I' m gonna kill you, motherfucker!
- Fuck me?
Fuck you!
Mike, do you have to be so combative?
A bullet in the head' il really mess up your extensions.
Take your bullet and eat that shit, man.
Sir, we just want to talk.
You want to talk?!
Go ahead.
We' re not lmmigration.
They can' t hear you because they' re still shooting at you.
Shit!
Got to make it home to my babies.
Damn, now.
Motherfucker!
You killed my brother!
That' s a bitch!
Shoot them.
Fucking shoot them.
They got me, man.
Got you.
Oh, shit!
Motherfucker!
I' m gonna kill you, motherfucker!
Come kill me, motherfucker.
You don' t take me alive.
You got three seconds to drop your weapon!
- A nice present for you!
- One!
- Two!
- I' m gonna kill you.
Don' t shoot.
Don' t kill me.
Excuse me.
- You all right, man?
Apologize to that man.
Apologize to that man.
Apologize.
Hey, listen, I owe you...
It' s just that, you know, you was disrespect...
Excuse me.
Whoosah, motherfucker!
See, the interesting thing is he' s the one of us that' s not pissed off.
- I don' t know nothing.
- I didn' t ask you no question yet!
- I don' t know nothing.
- No, get...
- How' d you know about the drop?
- I don' t know nothing!
- Stop lying!
Do you know anything?
I' m gonna be nice about it.
Do you know anything?
Let' s ask some other suspects.
- Hey, look, man, fuck it.
- Let' s try this.
Let' s talk to his homeys.
Hey, look here, man.
Can you tell me who was driving the black Suburban?
His brains is under the end table.
He can' t tell us shit, Mike.
- He' s all fucked up.
- What' s your point?
Dead suspects can' t say shit.
It seems like live suspects don' t say shit either, so I' il hot this dude here.
- Save us the paperwork.
- I don' t know nothing!
I don' t do motherfucking surveillance, man.
He don' t let nobody touch his camera.
- What' s on that camera?
- Trigger Mike strikes again.
Hi, welcome to Phat' s.
- Miami PD.
- Whoa.
Cops.
- We need to see what' s on this video.
- Absolutely.
You got a little bullet hole in there.
You guys tell me about it?
Guess not.
It has kick- ass bass.
You like hip- hop?
We freestyle in the break room.
If you guys ever want to kick it, we' il flow.
We' re gonna set you up on the wide- screen.
"Spanish Palms Mortuary."
Why would they be doing surveillance at a funeral home?
Is that a Cuban flag?
See the gun?
Never knew guards at funeral homes needed to carry them kind of weapons.
It just seems like we should turn it off...... because my dad owns the store.
She got a tongue ring.
- This is like a porno.
Dude.
- All right?
It' s just, you know, my dad' s gonna be...
I think I...
This is like a porno.
- This is official police business.
- What the fuck' s going on here?
My dad is coming.
What the hell is going on in my store?
Son, how did this porno crap get on my videos in my store?!
What the hell is going on in here?!
- You all right?
- No, I' m not all right, Mike.
Three days of this shit.
Got my nerves all rattled.
My ass still hurts...... from what you did to it the other night.
Oh, my Lord.
Yeah, it got rough.
You know how I get.
When you popped me from behind, I think you damaged some nerves.
Okay.
Now, I can' t...
- Can' t what?
- I can' t even get an erection.
What' s an erection?
Been eating them like Skittles.
That poor man is pouring out his heart.
And I' m still flaccid.
Okay.
I' m comfortable talking to you...
It' s got 5. 1 Dolby.... about what I did to your ass...... but you not getting an erection...... that' s a real problem for me.
- Yeah.
We partners, but we are partners with boundaries.
From now on you can' t say the word "flaccid" to me.
He' s a mean fuck.
So we gonna take the word "flaccid"...... and we' re gonna put it in there with my mom' s titties...... with your erection problems, and we' re gonna close this box...... and we' re gonna throw this bitch in the ocean.
And the only way that you can get to this box...... is you got to be motherfucking Jacques Cousteau.
We cool?
Oh, shit.
In front of my babies you got porno and homo shows up in here?
What kind of freak- ass store is this?
And you two motherfuckers need Jesus.
Cover your ears, baby.
Palm Mortuary, owned by an offshore holding company...... which, after 1 7 layers of bullshit...... turns out to be registered to Donna Maria Tapia...... mother of Hector Juan Carlos Tapia, who calls himself Johnny.
Johnny Tapia.
And, oh, does he win.
And got a dozen dumb- ass officers like you fired.
Well, he hasn' t run across us yet.
We' d love to hear what' s going on in that house.
Use your computer brain and tap the phone.
Well, that happens to be highly illegal without a judge.
We were thinking of something more along the lines of a training operation.
No, I can' t do that.
- Get you tickets to the Heat game.
- I need floor seats.
With thick- ass glasses you don' t need floor seats.
He can see the game from the parking lot.
- I can' t work under these conditions.
- Floor seats to the Heat.
You got it.
- Yes, Lakers.
Okay.
Hello?
Is this the pest control?
We got a fucking problem.
You know where we live.
- We got it.
Got our way in. - illegally?
It' s like, secret.
So y' all want to kill roaches? - illegal.
- We' il plant a couple gypsy wires...... find out what Tapia' s up to.
These are your basic household bugs.
Dog, this is what we do.
- What' s the sprayers for?
- The roaches.
We got rats.
- Say what?
That' s not an issue.
We' il just have to slightly adjust our approach a little bit.
I don' t mess with no rats.
Hey.
Stop it.
Get your head right.
- Mike, I' m a grown- ass man.
Get your grown- ass self together and let' s do this.
- You got a beautiful house, sir.
- Well, start looking.
They' re all over.
Those ain' t normal rats.
What he means is that they' re obviously a special breed.
- What kind of breed are they?
- Big motherfuckers.
But we should ensure there' s no breeding elsewhere in the house.
So we gonna leave these...
We' il leave these here and send in a special unit.
It' d be better to begin in the rest of the house.
You' re not getting in the rest of the house.
We won' t be able to guarantee our work.
Giving off offspring until we find the colony.
Rats don' t got no stinking colony.
What they do is they send out worker rats that are called...
Marsupials.
Marsupials.
They just looking for rat pussy.
- Are you fucking with me?
Hold on.
We can leave.
But what you should understand is that these rats will hump twice a day.
All right.
Just kill them and bring me the bill.
That' s that bullshit.
That' s that bullshit right there.
- Plant your wires.
- You' re not leaving me with them.
Gentlemen.
Oh, I really like that word, Johnny.
I' m just trying being civil.
This is business, we can all relax.
- Alexei, would you like a Cohiba?
- Why not?
Of course.
I' m told you' re a wine connoisseur.
I am.
Carlos, have Josef pick a wine and Alexei and I will have a cigar.
- Where the fuck you going?
I' m gonna head down to the truck, get some poison pellets and stuff.
No screwing around.
They' re all over.
Nice place you got here.
It' s Mama' s.
Built a fucking million years ago.
- Expensive shithole, eh?
- Oh, no.
Almost finished.
Look at the balls on that motherfucker.
Roberto...... the general' s office camera is out.
- How about yours?
- Almost got three wires planted.
There' s a papa rat humping the shit out of this mama rat.
No, he' s straight pile- driving her!
Now, how is that information gonna help me do my job?
They fuck just like us.
Where' s the pest guy?
There' s something going on down here.
Goddamn rats.
Yeah, they everywhere.
No disrespect...... but I do not wish to talk business until my partner return.
You secretly decide to pay me less and you talk about respect?
Let' s wait for Josef.
You know, me and digits.
Carlos, could you bring Josef in?
So...... your partner is here.
Would you like to talk now?
Carlos, another box.
So you sign over ownership papers for all the Florida clubs you own...... and I will control everything...... from point of origin to sale.
Especially Russian middleman.
With all due respect, Mr. Tapia...... in my country, I see such things all the time.
I' m sorry for your country.
That must be some Cuban stupid tradition to put them in a tortilla bin.
Now, listen to me, you Russian punk.
I, me, Johnny Tapia, will sever your head off!
You kill me and you will have a shit- storm.
Should I screw your young wife...... or visit your son, the soccer player?
My daughter knows your son.
- You' re gonna regret this.
Because at the end, what else do we have but friendship, trust...... honor.
Without this, we are no more than beasts.
The kitchen monitor' s out.
What the hell' s going on out there?
Shit.
I found something.
- It' s a guy' s finger.
- What, did the rats eat the rest of him?
- What the fuck are you doing?
I think I figured out your problem.
Y' all a bunch of filthy motherfuckers.
Blow out!
Shit!
- Get out of the house!
This shit' s got to stop.
Fuck!
Just another day with Mike Lowrey.
Roberto thinks they were the gangbangers...... that tried to hijack the drop, boss.
How did this thing happen?
I don' t know.
We called the rat people and these guys showed up.
Maybe you' re the rat, huh?
They tried to steal from me, and you let them into my mother' s house.
I would never...
Nobody puts in danger my daughter, my mother...... or my money.
Send him to the mortuary.
Johnny.
Johnny, what happened to Roberto?
He killed himself, Mama.
I' il do it.
Okay.
Bye.
- Yo, run the print.
- Run the print.
- Don' t touch me with no dead finger.
Excuse me, run this print.
I need to find the owner.
Of course.
We' re thinking about ordering lunch.
Should we put you down for some extra crispy and a couple of grape sodas?
"Couple of grape sodas."
That' s hilarious.
- Isn' t it low tide?
I think it is.
- What?
Yo, now you crossed the line, man.
Okay, no, that' s not funny.
No bullshit.
I want you...
... to find out...... who those two black puta de mierda are.
And I want them lying right here...... in Mama' s garden in these coffins!
And our mystery finger belongs to:
Josef Kuninskavich.
He was a lieutenant in a Russian mob.
Owned a couple dozen Florida nightclubs.
Tapia' s starting to knock off Russian mob bosses.
Got something.
What you got, dickhead?
Sort of like a visual code- breaking.
Little something I put together.
Some kind of boat.
"Dixie 7."
Dixie 7.
- It' s registered to a one Floyd Poteet.
- The Poteet brothers.
One of the KKK guys we busted.
You blew his ear off, remember?
Mike, can you teach me how to shoot people?
Listen to what we got at Tapia' s.
He' s telling him, "Yes, boss.
We found a bunch of fat doe fuckers...... and we' re getting them emptied. "
- Fat does emptied?
- The hell does that mean?
- He has a meeting this afternoon.
- You know who I am?
- Name sounds familiar.
I like that.
Meet me on the sand, 2: 00, Shore Club.
Let' s roll.
- Y' all come with us.
[Guns Cocking]
Ah, the Heckler & Koch G- 36.
Quite deadly in the right hands.
Ah, Agent One.
I have been so looking forward to this moment.
Well, in that case, I' il try not to disappoint.
You overestimate your power over women, Mr English.
I' d say that would be virtually impossible.
Sir?
Have you got them?
- Hmm?
- The mission documents.
Agent One' s flying tonight.
Yes, the mission documents.
Ah, here we are.
Agent One.
Gentlemen.
I' m here for my documents.
Bough, Agent One' s documents, please.
- Thank you.
Your mission documents, Agent One.
Including the codes for the submarine hatch, which I' ve checked myself.
Thank you.
So, is it just France tonight, or will you be slipping over the Pyrenees as well?
If I told you that, I' m afraid I' d have to kill you.
Oh, yes, yes.
Well, I expect you would.
Cheerio, Agent One.
Bonne chance.
Arrivederci.
Such class.
Such distinction.
Ml7 All Depts.
Urgent Agent One killed in action in Biarritz.
Submarine hatch failed to open.
The greatest secret agent England' s ever had snuffed out in an instant.
Terrible.
Do you know what makes us envied the world over, Bough?
- That there' s always another agent waiting to step in.
- Absolutely, sir.
And every last one of them is gathered around that grave.
It is our honour and privilege to guard them while they grieve.
Their lives are in our hands, Bough.
Everything in order, English?
I think you' il find it' s rather more than just in order, sir.
You' re now entering the most secure location in the whole of England.
[Man]
Pegasus, we face a national crisis.
Agent One was clearly onto something, and we have to find out what.
I need another agent on this.
Who else is there?
They all died in the explosion.
All of them?
Well, luckily there is one who survived.
Who?
- Sendin 'villains to Hades A hit with the ladies - Johnny English.
Right.
Johnny English.
I' m here to see Pegasus.
Still, no sense rushing things.
There are some items you need to sign before your briefing.
This is your new retinal I. D. Card, and this is your level nine security clearance.
Sign and date, please.
Oh, reminds me of the old service issue ballpoint.
I remember every agent would carry a pen that looked just like this.
Completely innocent to the untrained eye, but click it twice...
Ah, English, there you are.
Have you seen my secretary?
Um... she went out.
Um... shall we?
Now, Agent One believed that there was a plot to steal the Crown Jewels.
They' re due to be unveiled tonight at the Tower of London.
The queen is insisting that the ceremony goes ahead, so what we want you to...
Who...
Who is the sponsor, sir?
Pascal Sauvage.
What, that flouncy Frenchman who owns a couple of prisons?
Sauvage' s $7 billion empire, English, operates over 400 prisons in 60 countries.
- He' s built 25 of them here.
- Right, sir.
The man' s related to the royal family, for goodness' sake.
As far as the prime minister' s concerned, he' s one of the greatest friends England' s got.
Now, English, I want you at the Tower tonight, monitoring this unveiling.
Any chink in security, any weakness, however slight, must be plugged immediately.
Do we understand each other?
- Perfectly, sir.
- Oh, yes.
- And, uh, English... we can' t afford any mistakes... not tonight.
The word "mistake," sir, is not one that appears in my dictionary.
[Engine Revs]
Mr English, Colonel Sir Anthony Chevenix, head of Royal Security.
Ah, Colonel, good evening.
- Thirteen of them.
- Windows?
- Refitted with bullet - and shatter- proof glass.
I shall now mingle inconspicuously with the guests.
- Let me know when Her Majesty arrives.
- Very good.
Shall I mingle with you, sir?
Oh, yes, Bough.
Once you' ve checked the roof.
Well, hello.
Hello yourself.
Johnny English.
Lorna Campbell.
A Bloody Mary, please, not too spicy.
So, are you here in some professional capacity?
I worked on the restoration of the jewels.
- Intriguing.
- And yourself?
If I told you that, I' m afraid I' d have to kill you.
I' d like to see you try.
Monsieur Sauvage, on behalf of Her Majesty, may I welcome you to the Tower.
Merci, monsieur.
So, are you here alone, Mr English?
That' s how I choose to live my life, Miss Campbell.
I can offer them nothing but danger.
Some women find danger very attractive.
Women like you, Miss Campbell?
Women like me expect men like you... to find that out for yourself.
Madame.
Oh, it' s for me, actually.
Could your rustle up some of those cheesy niblets?
Now, where were we?
You obviously haven' t met our host, Monsieur Sauvage.
No, thank God.
You know, I think I' d rather have my bottom impaled on a giant cactus... than exchange pleasantries with that jumped- up Frenchman.
As far as I' m concerned, the only thing the French should host is an invasion.
Sorry, can I help?
Pascal Sauvage, jumped- up Frenchman.
Lorna Campbell.
- Enchante.
But of course!
You' re Johnny English.
I' ve heard all about you.
And between you and me, I' m not so keen on the French myself.
But please don' t tell them that.
Let me go and search for your nibbly cheese bits.
- I insist.
The French are, after all, fantastic waiters.
But- But...
No.
Please, please, please!
Les Francais.
Ils sont very... n' est- ce pas?
Ladies and gentlemen, mesdames est messieurs, bienvenus, welcome tonight to this wonderful occasion.
As we stand here in the Tower of London, the most famous prison in the world, where these wonderful jewels will rest safely... under lock and key,
It was, as we say in France, le top, le best of.
- [Feigned Chuckle]
- And what a beautiful...
Who hit him?
The assailant.
He ran in here.
Bough, you guard the door.
Aha!
The man' s a maniac!
- [Guests Gasp]
- You don' t frighten me!
- [Glass Shatters]
The panic' s over.
Everything' s under control.
- [Applause]
- [Chevenix Groans]
And now, ladies and gentlemen, we should compose ourselves for the arrival of Her Majesty... and return to the site of our great nation' s... magnificently restored Crown Jewels.
I feel it too.
The very symbols of our island nation, so close we could almost reach out and...
[Queen]
[Pegasus]
I couldn' t agree more, sir.
Well, we need to get these jewels back, English, and fast.
When they searched the room, there was no sign of him.
Well, the man was clearly a professional.
But he' s the only lead we' ve got.
We have to find him.
This is...
This is Roger from Data Support.
Please sit down.
He' il produce a likeness based on your description.
So tell us, what did this man look like?
Um... well... he was... big.
- Hair colour?
- Mmm.
And curly.
Well, frizzy, actually.
Frizzy sort of thing.
Two, I would say, at the most.
And a scar on his cheek... in the shape... of a banana.
- Which cheek?
- Both cheeks.
They sort of met in the middle.
[Gasps]
Oh, yes, that' s him.
An uncanny resemblance.
Why, it' s just as if he' s in the room with us.
Got all the bells and whistles.
Just focus on the case.
[Horn Honks]
Oh, uh...
Thank you very much for waiting.
Now, the question that faces us this morning is a simple one.
Namely, how did the thieves gain access to this highly secure environment... and then escape with thejewels afterwards?
A simple question, but one which I believe has a complex answer.
- Uh, please, Bough.
My mind is at work.
Now, what you must grasp, gentlemen, is that the master criminal... sees not a room but a series of opportunities.
Should I go in through the window?
Possibly.
- Actually, sir...
There' s one thing I think we can be fairly confident about, that is that they didn' t come up through the floor...
Just come my way, Bough.
- That' il bring me right over the hole, sir.
- There' s no need to panic.
Not yet, sir.
The shaft appears to be narrowing.
I' m just a little bit worried I might get stuck.
You won' t get stuck if you just keep moving.
[Bough Grunting]
Are you at the bottom now, Bough?
No, I am in fact stuck now, sir.
Oh, for God' s sake, Bough.
I' m coming down.
Uh, I' m not especially sure that' s a good idea, sir.
Don' t worry.
Be careful, sir!
Gently does it.
I landed on something quite soft.
- Oh, good.
What now?
But this must lead somewhere.
I' m slightly uncomfortable in the dark, sir.
There' s nothing to worry about, Bough.
- It may be pitch black, but we can still see.
How?
The Bedouin monks of the Al Maghreb mountains... developed a system of sonic chanting.
- The sound of their chanting... would bounce back off any obstacles, and using their highly tuned ears... they could paint a mental picture of the path ahead.
- Brilliant, sir.
- However, you must always sing in E- flat.
E- flat, E- flat, E- flat
Thank you for the music The songs I' m singing
- Is it working, sir?
- Extremely well, thank you, Bough.
You all right, sir?
I think I can see something, sir.
Oh, yeah.
- Shall we call for backup, sir?
What?
I don' t think so.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Ml7 at your service.
Observe, Bough, the dull incompetence of the criminal mind.
It can never hope to match our level of technical expertise.
What do we do now, sir?
Watch and learn, Bough.
- They' re too far ahead of us.
- Have faith, Bough.
- There they are, sir!
- Just as I thought.
- [Bough Groaning]
- We' re never gonna catch them in this.
- Take the wheel, Bough.
- Sir?
Change places, Bough.
I' m getting out the other side.
Sir?
Set, Bough.
Take me up.
Swing me out, Bough!
- Down.
Up!
Sorry!
Bough, pull out!
Faster!
Drop me here, Bough!
No!
No!
No!
[Bough]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
They' re turning into the Brompton Cemetery.
Get here as soon as you can.
In a wheelchair.
But Geoffrey overcame these terrible disabilities... with that simple resilience and sunny optimism... that so warmed all of us who knew him, spending the rest of his life in the service... of the poor and disabled of this parish.
It' s very good.
Really very good.
No, no, please go on.
I' m sorry to interrupt.
- Who' s that?
That priest act of yours should keep the other prisoners entertained for hours.
Oh, I' m so sorry.
Where are my manners?
Johnny English,
British Secret Service, and you are all under arrest.
I must say you' ve done this whole thing very well.
You, the grieving granny, you' re very convincing.
Oh, look.
Real tears.
Do you get paid extra for that?
Ahh, what we' re all here for.
I know!
Why don' t we take a look inside?
- Oh, you' ve nailed it down!
Why would you do that?
I know you' re gonna come back in two weeks and dig it up again.
Now, what are you playing in this little vignette of deceit and villainy?
I' m the hearse driver.
- You' re the hearse driver?
Ah!
Gunther.
Uh, I do hope he hasn' t made a nuisance of himself.
Bough, of the Lunatic Response Unit.
I' m afraid Gunther here wasn' t supposed to be released until 2028.
Isn' t that right, Gunther?
Yes, yes, there' s been the most monumental cock- up.
Um, if you' il excuse me, with the deepest respect, utmost sympathy.
- No.
- No, no.
That' s a blessing.
Are you gonna give me the gun, Gunther?
There.
That wasn' t too difficult, was it?
- Are you going to come home now?
Oh... in the van!
Yes, we are going in the van.
He' s waving good- bye.
Good- bye, everyone.
- Good- bye.
Mind the nice dead people.
There we go.
Oh, we' il just go to the path here.
Big step.
It' s a graveyard.
It' s where they bring people...
You can stop now.
- For appearances, I' il just hold your arm.
- Just keep walking.
In fact, run, run, run!
I can' t believe I' ve done this.
I mean, I really cannot believe I' ve done this!
You see, 200 years ago, my family should have inherited the throne of England, but they were cast aside.
Well, in a few very short days, it will be back where it belongs.
With me.
Shall I try it on?
Yes?
No?
Maybe?
To make you king, we need the archbishop of Canterbury to do that.
The archbishop of Canterbury... is being taken care of even as we speak.
TARGET LOCKED
There' s only one thing, sir.
What are we going to do about English?
He is no threat to us.
I had his flat bugged.
- [Duck Squeaks]
Clearly, the aptly named English is a fool.
He might be a fool, but he' s a fool who keeps showing up.
Well, the next time he shows up, eliminate him.
Thank you.
Dieter Klein and Klaus Vendetta, sir.
Released from prison six months ago.
Armed robbery, grievous bodily harm... and combined parking fines of more than 400...
Thank you, Bough.
I think we get the picture.
The point is, sir, that Vendetta and Klein... are both in the employ of Monsieur Sauvage.
- Pascal Sauvage?
- Precisely, sir.
But you' re not suggesting Sauvage is involved?
I think he' s more than just involved, sir.
I' m convinced he' s up to his French neck in it.
Don' t be absurd.
Sauvage employs thousands of people.
Just because two of them are villains doesn' t mean that he is.
I want him discounted from this investigation immediately.
Yes, sir.
All right.
Tonight I shall be at Sauvage' s reception for the new French ambassador.
Any developments, you can reach me there.
Apart from that, I don' t want you within a hundred miles of the man.
Absolutely, sir.
Requisition order:
Ml7 quartermasters for immediate supply; one military transport plane, fully fueled, with permission for nighttime city over flight; two night camouflage parachutes, plus reserves, plus neoprene bodysuits, twice, in black.
I' ve never liked the navy blue.
And a 40- inch chest for me 'cause I need the sleeve length.
- Morning, Felch.
Oh, and two Special Forces signet rings, primed and colour- coded.
- What' s all this for?
We' re going to break into Sauvage' s headquarters.
- But Pegasus said...
I know that Sauvage is behind all this, and tonight we' re going to get the evidence.
- Is something wrong, sir?
- Did that sound like Felch to you?
[Whispers]
[Whispers]
You, upstairs.
Can you see him, Bough?
He' s on the upper level, sir.
Got him.
And like a coiled viper... he strikes.
So what you' re saying, sir, is there must have been two of them?
Oh, at least, Bough.
I wonder why I didn' t see them.
You mustn' t dwell on your mistakes.
- You must learn from them, then move on.
- So where were you, sir?
- Just drop it, Bough!
- That bike.
You get things sorted out for tonight.
Well, well, we meet again.
Mr English.
What a pleasant surprise.
I wondered when you might show up again.
On the contrary, Miss Campbell.
It' s you.
Do you like sushi?
Oh, sushi!
I practically live off the stuff.
You might say the mysteries of the Orient are no mystery to me.
- Sake?
Sake.
Cheers.
May all your daughters be born with three bottoms.
Now then, perhaps you can explain how it is... that I run into you at two crime scenes... and then can' t find any record of you on a single government computer.
Shouldn' t you ask the government that?
I am the government and I' m asking you.
Let me.
You' re brave.
They say that sea urchin' s the ultimate acquired taste.
It' s a personal favourite of mine.
I think people are put off by how it feeds through its bottom.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Excuse me.
I' m from Ml7.
I' m a secret agent.
- Everything set, Bough?
- Just about, sir.
Actually, sir, do you mind if I run through the plan one more time?
- No, no.
- These are the two buildings here.
This one is our target, Sauvage' s headquarters, next to City Hospital.
I jump first and land on the south side of the roof, abseil down 14 floors and cut through this window here.
I then land on the east side and abseil down 12 floors.
Where you wait for my signal that I' ve disabled the alarm system.
- You them break into this window here, work your way along the secure corridor and penetrate Sauvage' s office.
- Yes, yes.
- Is that okay, sir?
It' s been okay ever since I thought up the idea, Bough.
Your laser beacon.
- My what?
- Your laser beacon!
It' il guide you onto Sauvage' s building.
Your dependence on hardware really does amuse me, Bough.
I' ve been dropped into the Kalahari Desert... carrying nothing more than a toothbrush and a packet of sherbet lemons, and I still found my way to Bulawayo before Ramadan.
So thank you, Bough, but no thank you.
- Bough, go!
Geronimo!
Roger that, Bough.
This is worse than I thought, Bough.
Sauvage has got some kind of laboratory set up here.
God knows what kind of sick operation he' s running.
My God, what have they done to you?
They' ve taken some of my blood.
- Bastards!
- It' s only for tests.
Of course it is.
Let' s get you out of here before they take anything else.
Ah!
Good evening, Dr Frankenstein.
This way, please.
Come on.
I haven' t got all night.
And you, you angels of death.
About turn.
Come on, let' s go.
Over there.
I know what you' re doing here.
And you.
Quicker.
Quicker.
Over there.
Now then, perhaps you could direct me to your evil paymaster.
- What are you talking about?
- You know exactly what I' m talking about.
Where is the office of Pascal Sauvage?
Are you coming over here in a minute, sir?
I' m from Ml7.
This has been a test of your emergency response systems, and I have to say you' ve all done extremely well.
And, uh, get well soon.
Oh, God!
Sir.
Sir.
Did you just land on the wrong building?
I did a precautionary sweep of the immediate environment.
- And everything was fine.
Okay, let' s go.
- That' s far enough.
- Well, good evening.
- Perhaps you' d like this as well.
- What is it?
Well executed, Bough, but completely redundant.
- How do you mean, sir?
- Super- strength muscle relaxant.
When he wakes up, he' il be as floppy as a damp old sock.
What' s this?
That' s the face of the archbishop of Canterbury.
What are they doing?
What' s this got to do with the Crown Jewels?
[Bough]
A people whose empire once covered... one quarter of the surface of the earth.
Alas, no longer.
My friends ask me, "Pascal, how can you be so interested... in such a backward, grotty little country?"
The queen.
The queen has more power in her tiny white gloves... than any other head of state in the entire world.
She can declare war or make peace, and most intriguingly... she can seize any piece of land which takes her fancy.
Of course, the queen never uses... the enormous power afforded to her.
But imagine someone who would use that power.
Imagine, say, me.
But how could he do that, sir?
How could he make himself king?
The archbishop.
Hands up.
There' s a good fellow.
You fool, English.
You' il never get out of the building alive.
I' d save your breath for my questioning.
Incorrect.
Sodium pentothal.
- I won' t lie to you.
- [Groans]
Now then, why does Sauvage want to have himself crowned?
You have no idea what' s going on here, do you?
It would be funny if it wasn' t so "pablibblit."
What?
[Mumbling Gibberish]
- He' s talking gibberish, sir.
- I can hear that.
- He' s collapsed onto me, sir.
- I can see that.
- You don' t think you could' ve got the syringes mixed up?
Given the guard outside truth serum and given Klein the muscle relaxant?
Don' t be ridiculous, Bough.
I think I know my right from my left.
- Sir?
Bough, take "flodd."
- Take what, sir?
- I' m not quite getting that second word, sir.
- "Schlaaaagh!"
"C." C- A...
Car!
Take the car!
We came by plane.
- Hold it right there.
- What' s wrong with them?
- I' m not telling you.
Wrong answer.
What is it with you two?
[Groaning]
Let' s get outta here.
Sorry, but who are you, exactly?
I' m attached to Interpol in Paris.
We' ve been watching Sauvage for months.
Why?
Because every major convict released from a Sauvage prison in six months... has been employed by one of his companies.
- We just don' t know what yet.
- What did he say?
We have to report to Pegasus!
Oh, no, sir.
- How do we get out of here?
- Hey, you two!
What you did to me really hurt.
Sorry about that.
How do we get out of here without being seen?
Okay.
Left by the fountain, right by the fire exit, to the elevator at the end.
- Thank you.
- Oh, my God.
Sir, you can' t go to Sauvage' s reception in this state.
The effect of the drug has practically worn off.
I' m "fline"...
"schline"... uh, "gline"...
- Monsieur.
Thank you.
- Would you like another?
- Please.
What in God' s name...
Ah, Foreign "Sebretarary."
- Shall we dance?
Excuse me, sir.
I' m very sorry to interrupt...
Pascal, how nice to see you again.
- Enjoying the party?
- Oh, splendid affair.
I was until I was informed that your man English... and his curious boyfriend here have spent the evening... breaking into my office and assaulting my staff.
- Is this true, Bough?
What do you think you' re up to?
- Sir, if I could just offer...
- Go home, Bough!
Now!
I gave you direct orders not to meddle with Sauvage.
Break into his office and assault two of his staff.
Then you march in here, loaded with God knows what, and insult the foreign secretary.
I haven' t encountered such behaviour in Whitehall in 30 years.
- But...
- There are no "buts," English.
You' re off the case.
Your security clearance is hereby cancelled.
After a three- month leave of absence, you will return at your old grade.
And I hope never to hear your name again.
English has seen too much.
We go to plan "B."
Get rid of the fake archbishop... and green- light the visit to Her Majesty.
Then this pathetic country can humiliate itself... by crowning me officially.
THE QUEEN' S RESlDENCE AT SANDRlNGHAM
That' s a letter of abdication... renouncing your claims to the throne... and the claims of your entire family.
Sign it.
Never.
- Yes?
Prime Minister, sorry to call so late, but I' m afraid the queen is abdicating.
What?
Abdicated?
But that' s not possible.
I only wish that were true.
- Let me talk to her.
Maybe she just...
- Pascal, she' s gone.
My people have spent the last 10 hours... trying to track down the rightful heir to the throne... and they' ve come up with a name, which they' ve double- checked.
Who is it?
- It' s you.
- No!
Pascal Sauvage has requested that his coronation... take place this Thursday.
In the House, the prime minister said he was looking forward to the ceremony... and he believed that Monsieur Sauvage will make a fine king... and will bring all that is best about modern Europe to our ancient institutions.
Get your car keys.
We' ve got work to do.
- Miss Campbell.
- Sauvage is heading back to France.
He' s invited 13 of the richest criminal masterminds in the world to meet him there.
I' m sorry, Miss Campbell.
It' s been reassigned.
I know.
Reassigned to me.
- I want you with me.
- Just leave me alone.
Are you gonna sit here in this grotty flat feeling sorry for yourself?
Or are you gonna get out there and save your country?
I' m gonna sit in the flat.
- Johnny, this is ridiculous.
- I' m a spent force.
Spent, my ass.
Will... you... please... stop?
[Groans]
NORTHERN FRANCE
It' il be nightfall in an hour.
Then we can strike out for the chateau.
The fact is, the moment Sauvage gets that crown on his head, he' il be able to do whatever he likes with the country that I love, and that is why you and I have got to stop him.
- Relishing the thought?
- Something like that.
I suppose you' ve made love to lots of women, haven' t you, Johnny?
Uh, well, you know, one does one' s best.
It' s just...
Well, it' s been three years since my fiance left me, and since then I haven' t made love to anyone.
But then I met you... and I felt this... hunger... deep down inside.
I wanted to say things to you, I wanted to do things to you... that I haven' t wanted to do in a very, very, very long time.
What sort of things are we talking about?
Things like punching you in the face, kicking you in the backside for being such a pompous, know- nothing asshole.
But then I started to see beyond the idiot that everybody else saw.
I started to see the man on the inside... who was determined to do his duty, no matter what or who lay in his way.
And I began to feel other things for him, to want to do other things for him.
Things... involving plastic toys and soft cheese?
[Scoffs]
- What?
You' re toying with me.
N- N- No...
You' re such a special person... not to take advantage of me while I' m vulnerable.
- N- No...
Well...
- So thank you... for being such a gentleman.
Not at all.
I know what you' re thinking, Miss Campbell.
If we don' t pull this off, God knows what might happen to England.
Actually, I was thinking there must be a better way in than that pipe.
Well, there isn' t.
I' ve analysed it from every angle, and this is the best option.
I' il go in first, and if it' s a clear way through, I' il call down.
Johnny.
- I' m always careful.
Ohh.
- Gentlemen.
I will become the next king of England.
Oh, no.
- Up the ladder.
Pull yourself together.
It' s only a bit of poo.
Oh, it' s cold!
It' s cold!
What is the one commodity... the world never seems to run out of?
- [Guests Murmuring]
- Lawbreakers.
Every nation in the world struggles... with the issue of overcrowded prisons.
So, what do we do with all these villains?
Find the solution to that problem... and the governments of the world would pay you through their nose.
Fortunately, I have found a solution.
We empty every prison on the entire planet, we take the resulting tidal wave of human scum... and we put it here.
I will turn England into the largest prison... in the history of the world.
- Come on.
For the entire world to dump its human waste in.
According to current projections, we will not run out of prison space for the next 500 years.
So, tonight one, and only one, of you... will leave here owning 49 percent... of this venture.
We must get hold of that DVD.
But how, Johnny?
There' s only two of us.
What you seem to have forgotten is that...
Nobody knows we are here.
At our disposal we have the vital element of surprise.
Now, my plan is simple but effective.
I shall drop from the gallery at this end of the room and take Sauvage prisoner.
Then, using Sauvage as a hostage, we' il get the hell out of here.
Clear?
Get 'em up, you French ponce.
But, Mr English, I' m gobsmacked!
What an unexpected surprise.
Surprises are very much my speciality, Sauvage.
I think we' ve seen enough of this.
I know exactly what you' re planning, and I' m here to put a stop to it.
My bottom will be king of England before you are.
Wrong again.
Perhaps you' d care to look behind you.
Oh, please.
I' m sorry, Johnny.
Well, I' m afraid that we' il have to... conclude the floor show for tonight.
Not so fast, Sauvage.
You may have taken me, but you' il never take England.
[Click]
You know, Mr English, I' m going to miss you.
Really.
I thank you.
Take them away.
[Speaking French]
As the crowds are gathering here for the crowning of our first French king... since the year 1066, call here at London FM with the top ten things you most love about the French.
We haven' t had any calls yet, uh, at all, but the lines are still open and I' il give you that number again... 0- 2- 0- 7... zero, deux, zero, sept...
We' ve got to think of something.
I' ve got an idea.
Hop!
And hop!
What?
It has long been their belief... that a whistle pitched at the precise resonant frequency of a metal lock... will vibrate the levers in such a way that the door will simply swing open.
- And kneel.
- [Groaning]
Here goes.
[Whistle:
- I can' t hear anything.
- I' m into ultrasonic.
Will you just stop all this and face facts?
We' ve failed.
The only thing that can save us now is a miracle.
- Ohh!
- Sir?
I don' t know why you hauled yourself up that dreadful poo tube, Bough, when there was a perfectly good ladder right beside it.
Now, Sauvage may have fooled the country... with his fake archbishop and his secret agenda, but he hasn' t fooled me.
- So, here' s the plan.
Sirs, you are hereby called to witness the anointing... of your one true lord and future king Pascal.
Pascal, are you willing to take the oath?
I am willing.
Then be thou anointed... with this holy oil.
And do you, the chosen bishops of England, Scotland and Wales, ascent to this anointing?
For Wales, I do.
For England, I do not!
No, please.
Let him speak.
It is this man, Pascal Sauvage, who stole the Crown Jewels, who forced the queen to abdicate... and who would kill anyone who got in his way.
[Yells]
He has cheated, conned and manipulated... this great country for his own ends.
He' s fooled you all!
What' s more, this whole ceremony is a sham... because that man standing in front of you... is not the archbishop of Canterbury.
English, a word of advice:
Don' t go there.
Shut it, Frenchy.
I' il go wherever I damn well please.
- What?
Your face is made of plastic.
Remove it at once.
Right.
I' il just have to remove it myself.
[Grunting, Muttering]
- Maybe it pulls up from the front.
- [Archbishop Groaning]
Must be a join here somewhere.
Fascinating performance as always, Monsieur English, but I' m afraid we must move on.
Nobody' s moving anywhere until I' m finished with this piece of low- life.
look busy "?
- Are you insane?
Go on, over.
All right, so I was wrong about the archbishop' s bottom.
- But there' s more.
- But not, I' m afraid, today.
Sergeant, please take this man away.
- But be gentle with him.
- Do you think that' s it?
You think I don' t have more evidence?
Get him out of here!
- Play it, Bough!
Play the disk!
Now!
Well, shall we?
Then as Solomon was anointed king... by Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet, so be thou anointed... and consecrated king... over all the peoples... whom the Lord thy God... hath given thee to govern... and of all your possessions, wherever they may be.
[Congregation Gasping]
- No!
- That is my crown!
- Give it back!
- Never in a million years, Sauvage!
Merde!
[Shouting In French]
- Stop!
- Shut up!
[All Gasping]
All this stupid little country have to do is stand in line... and do what it' s told for one miserable day!
But can it do that?
My fragrant French ass, it can!
The crown!
Go!
[Shouting In French]
And so, in the name of the Father... and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,
What...
Arrest that man... and lock him away.
Words can hardly express just how much we appreciate everything you' ve done.
Nothing more than my duty, ma' am.
And in return, is there anything that your queen and country can do for you?
Well, since one is asking, ma' am...
In celebration of her return to the throne, the queen has declared August 5 a national holiday... and has conferred a knighthood on the unnamed Ml7 agent... responsible for foiling the plot of French businessman Pascal Sauvage.
Mr Sauvage is now awaiting trial for high treason, a crime which still carries the death penalty.
If found guilty, he' s asked that his brain be donated to medical science... to further research into the causes of hyper manic schizophrenia.
Meanwhile, the unnamed English agent has left the country... and has already embarked on his next challenging mission.
[Lorna]
SirJohnny English.
Her Majesty did seem very grateful.
She' s not the only one.
You are full of surprises.
- Johnny!
The chain has never been broken.
Not once.
Not in 14 centuries.
Not since we elders first began to leapfrog through time.
That' s the way of it.
It is Marcus' turn to reign, not mine.
- There' s been a complication.
- But I had no choice.
The coven is in danger, and Michael is the key...
Yes.
The Lycan.
Please.
Give me the chance to get proof you require.
Fine.
I will leave it to Kraven to collect the proof...... if there is any.
How could you trust him over me?
Because he is not the one who has been tainted by an animal.
I love you...... like a daughter, but you leave me with no choice.
These rules are in place for a good reason...... and they are the only reason we have survived this long.
You will not be shown an ounce of leniency.
When Amelia arrives, the Council will convene and decide your fate.
You have broken the chain and the Covenant!
You must be judged!
You should' ve listened to me and stayed out of this.
Now you' il be lucky if I can convince the Council to spare your life.
Tell me.
Did you have the nerve to cut the skin from his arm, or did Lucian do it?
Mark my words.
Soon, you' il be seeing things my way.
Understood?
I can' t afford to have my future queen run off with that Lycan again.
Shit.
Change of plans.
Amelia will be picked up by Soren and his team.
- That' s our job.
- Not anymore.
- Why are you helping me?
- I' m not.
I' m helping me.
- What' s going on?
- The perimeter sensor' s been tripped.
We' re locking down the mansion.
It' s Selene.
She' s escaped, to go to him, to Michael.
I want that Lycan' s head on a plate.
We need to go.
Get down!
Go.
- Jump.
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Any luck?
- False alarm.
The dogs would' ve been all over it if anything had gotten near that fence.
- Amelia should have arrived by now.
- Yes.
Look, I want you to slip off the property and find out what' s keeping her.
You' ve got it.
Maybe we should pull over and dose him.
Fuck him.
He' il be all right.
We' re almost there.
He' s not gonna make it.
Pull over.
Pull over!
Get the kit.
Stick him.
Stick him.
My lord.
I sent for Selene...... not you.
She' s defied your orders...... and fled the mansion, my lord.
Your incompetence is becoming most taxing.
It' s not my fault.
She' s become obsessed...... thinks that I' m at the core of some ridiculous conspiracy.
And here' s my proof.
Now, I want you to tell them exactly what you told me.
All right, all right.
For years, we' ve been trying to combine the bloodlines.
And for years, we' ve failed.
It was useless.
Even at the cellular level, our species destroyed each other.
Yet the key, we knew...... was to locate the rarest of bloodlines...... a direct descendant of Alexander Corvinus...... Hungarian, a warlord...... who came to power in the early seasons of the fifth century.
Just in time to watch a plague ravage his village.
He alone survived.
Somehow, his body was able to change the disease...... mold it to his benefit.
He became the first true immortal.
And years later, he fathered at least two children...... who inherited this same trait.
The sons of the Corvinus clan.
One bitten by bat, one by wolf...... one to walk the lonely road of mortality as a human.
- It' s a ridiculous legend, nothing more.
- That may be...... but our species do have a common ancestor.
There is a descendant of Corvinus lying there...... not three feet from you.
Yes.
We needed a pure source...... untainted.
An exact duplicate of the original virus.
The Corvinus strain itself, which we learned...... was hidden away in the genetic code of his human descendants...... and passed along in its dormant form...... down through the ages to Michael Corvin.
His blood allows for a perfect union between our species.
There can be no such union.
- And to speak of it is heresy.
- We' il see.
- Once Lucian has injected him...
- Lucian is dead.
According to whom?
I can assure you, my child...... Kraven will pay with his life.
Soon, this house will lie in ruins.
- Not before you.
- No, wait.
Wait.
You and you alone will know the truth of this.
If Lucian was able to get his hands on the blood of a Pure- Born...... a powerful elder like Amelia...... or yourself...... and inject it along with Michael' s blood...
Abomination.
Half- Vampire...... half- Lycan, but stronger than both.
I need to speak with Kahn.
My lord...... the Council members have been assassinated.
- What of Amelia?
- They bled her dry.
It has already begun.
I' m sorry I doubted you.
Fear not, my child, absolution will be yours...... the moment you kill the descendant of Corvinus, this...... Michael.
You' ve been given an enzyme to stop the change.
It may take a little time for the grogginess to dissipate.
That' s enough!
Just go and see what' s keeping Raze, will you?
I really must apologize.
He' s in desperate need of a lesson in manners.
Speaking of manners, where are mine?
Forgive me.
I' m Lucian.
I need to go.
I need to get back.
There' s no going back.
There' s no going anywhere.
The Vampires will kill you on sight.
Just for being what you are.
One of us.
You are one of us.
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Bringing an end to this conflict.
Your war, it has nothing to do with me.
My war?
No!
No!
Sonja!
They forced you to watch her die.
Sonja.
That' s what started the war.
I saw it happen as if I were there.
We were slaves once.
The daylight guardians of the Vampires.
I was born in servitude...... yet I harbored them no ill will.
I even took a Vampire for my bride.
It was forbidden...... our union.
Viktor feared a blending of the species.
Feared it so much...... he killed her.
His own daughter...... burnt alive...... for loving me.
This is his war...... Viktor' s...... and he' s spent the last 600 years...... exterminating my species.
What are they gonna do to Selene?
We have company.
- I thought we had a deal.
- Patience.
Kraven.
These are matters to be discussed in private.
Please escort our guests downstairs.
The Council has been destroyed.
Soon, you will have it all.
Both great covens and an ironclad peace treaty with the Lycans.
Who I trust will not be forgotten when the spoils are tabulated.
How do you expect me to assume control now that Viktor' s awake?
There' s no defeating him.
He grows stronger as we speak.
And that is precisely why I need Michael.
If Viktor were so easy to dispatch...... you' d have done it yourself centuries ago.
Exit shaft!
Move it!
Son of a bitch!
Oh, shit!
It' s Viktor.
Yes.
And if you had done your job, he' d still be in hibernation.
Where the hell is Raze?
Is there another way out?
I guess it didn' t occur to you that you' il have to bleed to pull off this coup.
Don' t even think about leaving.
Silver nitrate.
Bet you weren' t expecting that.
Move!
Move!
Move!
Lucian.
Selene!
Selene!
I have to get you out.
And he won' t be satisfied until every Lycan' s dead.
They' il kill you too, just for helping me.
I know.
I know what started the war.
That' s enough.
You' re coming with me!
I hope I live to see Viktor choke the life from you!
I bet you do.
But let me tell you a little something about your beloved dark father.
He' s the one who killed your family.
Not the Lycans.
Never could follow his own rules.
Said he couldn' t abide the taste of livestock.
So every once in a while, he went out and gorged himself on human blood.
I kept his secrets...... cleaned up the mess.
But it was he...... who crept room to room...... dispatching everyone close to your heart.
But when he got to you...... he just couldn' t bear the thought of draining you dry.
You, who reminded him so much of his precious Sonja...... the daughter he condemned to death.
- Lies.
- Believe what you want.
Now come on.
Your place is by my side.
So be it.
Bite him!
Half - Vampire...... half - Lycan...... but stronger than both.
What the hell are you doing?
You may have killed me...... cousin.
But my will...... is done regardless.
Where is he?
Where' s Kraven?
Forgive me, my child.
It wasn' t the Lycans.
It was you.
Leave us.
How could you bear my trust...... knowing that you' d killed my family?
Yes.
I have taken from you.
But I have given so much more.
Is it not a fair trade, the life I have granted you?
The gift of immortality?
And the life of your daughter?
Your own flesh and blood?
I loved my daughter!
But the abomination growing in her womb...... was a betrayal of me and of the coven!
I did what was necessary to protect the species...... as I am forced to do yet again.
No!
Time to die.
Though I cannot predict the future...... the consequences of tonight will reverberate through the halls...... of both great covens for many years to come.
Two Vampire elders have been slain...... one by my own hand.
Soon, Marcus will take the throne.
And a tide of anger and retribution will spill out into the night.
Differences will be set aside.
Allegiances will be made.
I will become the hunted.
The Mexican cartels have 1, 500 miles of border between them and the greatest drug- consuming nation on earth...... separated by a 15- foot- high fence which starts at the Pacific Ocean and travels the distance of four states.
They flood our streets, day after day, week after week, at an average of 20 tons a month.
That' s enough to provide a line of cocaine for every man, woman, and child on this planet.
- It' s me.
What' s up?
I' ve got tickets to the Tuesday game.
- Is that right?
14?
Oh, I' m with that!
I' il see you there.
From 10 tons a week ago in Colombia to one bump tonight in L. A., worlds away from the men who run the whole goddamned show.
And remember, no one must make all the arrests.
Are we clear?
We' re clear that you wouldn' t be going in there without us.
Let' s get ready to move.
Demetrius, let' s have the gun.
- Está loco.
- You gotta be kidding me, Frost.
Isn' t that right, Sean?
Come on.
Memo Lucero was a Colombian who saw opportunity in Mexico' s northern border towns.
He set up shop in Tijuana and built the busiest, most lucrative drug pipeline the world has ever seen.
Lucero never slept in the same place twice, so no one ever knew where he was.
But after seven years, we finally tracked him down.
Let' s go.
They call us down here.
They take away our weapons?
I mean, that isn' t fun.
You' re not getting paid to have fun.
Good luck, gentlemen.
Bureaucrats!
Ay, chingado.
All right.
Stay down!
Shit!
You have no idea what kind of mistake you' re making.
Put your hands up!
Things are only gonna get worse, for all of us.
Do me a favor and shut the fuck up!
Come on.
- I' il think about it.
- I can' t go home and see my wife?
I' il think about it!
Get out of here, you knucklehead!
Good job!
Damn right, good job!
We got him!
- Honey, I' m still down here.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I' m okay.
Right.
Baby...... what are you wearing?
One of your old jerseys.
Not that blue one that you look incredibly sexy in.
Yeah, the one that smells like you.
- Is that a good thing?
- It' s a great thing.
What are you doing right now?
Making candles.
Is that pine or evergreen?
Sean!
Of course it is.
Oh, I miss you!
Two months ago, with the arrest of Memo Lucero, we finally dealt the Pacific corridor its first substantial blow.
We didn' t talk like cops, we didn' t look like cops, we didn' t act like cops.
For that matter, we never hung out with them, either.
We had an edge that came from growing up on the streets.
That' s why were the most successful anti- narcotics crew in law enforcement.
We made the dent that the naysayers said we couldn' t make.
From this day forward, things will be different.
By taking out Lucero, we have cut the head off the dragon.
And now we are sending an emphatic message to anyone out there who may have designs on filling the void left by Memo Lucero.
What' s happening, homes?
Peace will be restored, and the flow of cocaine will stop.
I' m happy to announce that, effective today, their business in Southern California is over.
To the men and women of our undercover units, enjoy the accolades, because you' ve certainly earned them.
They want to ball against us, dog.
Against who?
Ramon Cardena was killed yesterday.
- Yeah, state' s attorney' s.
I' m not gonna shed any tears over it, but I am concerned about one thing... this could get a little bit messy.
Frost, this is for you.
Enlightenment?
Baby, he' s a senior citizen.
- Give him the Viagra candle.
- Sean!
What' s up, dog?
What did I tell you about smoking?
I got you, dog.
You don' t want me to put you in the sleeper hold.
What' s up with all these damn narc cars out here?
Is this a police convention?
Believe me, you' re cool here.
You' re with me.
It' s my house.
I sure hope it' s cool to go through.
- Hi.
What' s up with that?
What' s up, my Main D?
Yo, Sexy, what' s going on, boy?
Man, it' s cracking out here.
- Yeah!
- Oh, my goodness!
Yeah?
Right here, right now.
Why can' t women think like that?
Sometimes a man got to get his fuck on without love getting in the way of it, that' s all I' m saying.
- Amen.
- That' s what I' m talking about.
Now, I' m sure that my man Sean feels the same way, right?
- Yes.
- Get the hell out of here!
Why you trying to do that to me?
- Oh, you' re not whipped?
I' m peeping right now.
You still got the game?
No, no, I' m just joking.
You' re having a what?
Look at y' all!
What are you guys talking about?
You see what I' m talking about?
All changed!
Want to help out your pops?
Give me...
D. E. A., punk.
Don' t move, bitch, or I' il blast you!
No, that' s enough of that.
What?
I didn' t make her do it.
Hicks taught her that, not me.
- You didn' t teach her that?
- I just taught her to...
- Do you?
You' re so sweet.
Yeah.
I know you taught her that.
Want me to kick everyone out?
You read my mind.
- You.
What' s up?
What do I think?
Good shit, man.
I think we should let the games begin.
I' il take care of him.
I' m so proud of you, baby.
Who is it, baby?
Get down!
Stay down!
Fuck!
Hey, you fuck, you come into my house while I sleep?
You can' t kill Diablo.
What did you say?
You cannot kill Diablo.
Stace, call 9- 1- 1.
Get up.
Are you...?
Baby...... I’ m okay.
I protected you.
- You hit?
- I am.
I' m okay.
9 - 1- 1.
All right, baby...
Hello?... look at me.
Sir?
What' s the nature of the emergency?
I' m fine.
I' m okay.
I can' t understand you, sir.
Can you speak up?
Are you there, sir?
It' s all right.
Say hi to Uncle Sean.
Hi, Sean.
It' s all right, dog.
Just rest.
Stacy.
Stacy.
Sean.
Sean.
Where' s Stacy?
Where' s my wife?
Look, man, um...
You lost a lot of blood.
Where is she?
They buried her, Sean.
Where' s my wife?
Calm down, now.
I' ve got you, man.
I' ve got you.
Fight on, man.
We' il take care of you.
Which one is it?
Right over there.
This prisoner is in for two life sentences.
He' s got nothing to lose, but that doesn' t matter.
You and I both know who this guy is and what he is capable of, so you stay ten feet away from him at all times, and do not touch or threaten the prisoner at any time.
- Clear.
Open it up.
You' ve got five minutes.
Ten feet, Vetter!
- Yeah.
You tried to have me killed...... and you don' t want to talk to me?
I have all the time in the world.
Get him out of here!
You didn' t think I was gonna get to you?
Is that your family?
All right, fuck the talk.
Let me just ask you a question.
Did you kill my wife?
Did you kill my wife?
Answer me, motherfucker.
Answer the fucking question!
Vetter, step away from the prisoner!
Vetter, damn it, I told you!
Get away.
I was just asking him for a smoke.
Get off me.
I got a smoke for you.
If I wanted you dead...
... you would be.
Let' s go, Vetter.
Come on.
Come on!
Come on!
Okay, okay, okay.
Come on, Vetter, let' s move.
Come on.
The order to hit my home had to come from the top, but to find that person, you have to start at the bottom and work your way up the pipeline.
Somewhere along the line, someone will talk.
- What' s up with you?
Chillin ', man.
Where Sexy at?
- In the house.
- Okay.
Yo, Big Sexy.
What' s up with your D- Max?
- Chillin ', dog.
- I' m glad you came.
I didn' t know y' all was rolling.
What' s up, man?
All right?
So what' s up?
We need to know who out there moving major weight.
What kind of weight y' all talking about?
Distribution level.
Some real shit.
Guys who are hooked up with this new network.
Why you drinking out the milk carton?
Damn!
Sexy, for real, man.
Talkin 'about this weight, we need to know who movin' it.
Those niggas over in Ghost Town.
They movin 'major weight over by that church, man.
You know, with your little dog?
I got the dog thing goin '.
Sean, I' m thinking that could help us out.
You down with hitting them fools up?
- Let' s hit 'em up.
- Yeah, like tonight.
Cool.
I heard you came by the hospital.
Sorry, man.
That' s cool.
I' m telling you, man, we should have brought the D. E. A. Dogs out here.
Come on, D, don' t insult me like that.
- Well, get to sniffin '.
- Chill, chill, chill.
- We ain' t got all night.
- Come on, boy.
Go get 'em, boy.
All right, cool.
Go on, baby.
What' s taking so long?
We ain' t got all night, man.
Ain' t in that one.
Come on, Capone.
- You sure?
Yeah, I' m sure!
He got it, man.
Wait a minute!
This ain' t your car!
You get away from here.
Easy, ma' am, I' m just doing my job.
You assholes ain' t got nothing else to do but come harass innocent, hardworking citizens with this crap?
This is an honest, blue- collar neighborhood.
They could afford to pay those $130 tow jobs.
This is an official impound.
My man, we got this.
Is this your vehicle?
It could be my vehicle.
Who are you supposed to be?
This is who I' m supposed to be, right here.
Sexy, pop the trunk, man.
Pop the trunk!
Hurry up!
Fuck is going on?
Come on.
Damn!
Now, is that your shit?
Is it?
No.
That' s Monroe' s car.
- They call him Overdose.
- Right over there.
All right.
Go on back in the house.
Ain' t got enough time for this stuff.
Tow the car, nigga.
Yo, Sexy, you' ve got to come here.
- Sexy, roll, man.
- Careful, man.
We got dope.
Fuck!
"Diablo."
Fuck!
We' re police officers!
Get the fuck out of my house!
- You got to chill!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Get the fuck out!
We' re here to help.
That' s all.
Do your thing.
I' m reloading my shit.
Sean, hold your fire.
Now, look, man, I' m coming up, so you' ve got to stop shooting.
Don' t try nothing, homey.
Just take it easy, all right?
If we were the cleanup crew, we would have finished you off from down here, man.
Wouldn' t be sticking my head in here trying to get shot.
Now, I' m coming up.
Slow.
I put my gun down, all right?
I know you scared.
I know you don' t like the police...
Damn sure talking to a police in an attic.
They used to fuck with us all the time.
Me and my homies would be rolling down the street.
- You po- po.
- I know.
We used to complain that police didn' t do nothing for us.
And we was right, they didn' t.
I made a choice.
I' m trying to help.
But what you doin ', man, you ain' t helpin' us.
By the way things look downstairs, you need to think about getting into a whole 'nother game.
Only one alternative... you put that gun down, or my partner downstairs, man, trust me, he will take you out.
Now, do the right thing and just put it down.
Since everything went down with the big man, shit has been major slow, know what I' m sayin '?
He went up to, like, $20, 000 a ki.
I couldn' t do nothing with that, man.
- Who' s this new dude?
- I don' t know his name.
He contacted me, say he had this, that, and the other.
- Right.
- But hell no.
Then this stupid motherfucker gonna call me back, telling me some shit about, he want $20, 000 a ki, and I got to buy it?
Who you think you talkin 'to?
You kiss my ass.
- So what happened?
- What you mean?
Why you still alive and your homies are dead?
- Doin 'what?
- Hidin '.
What kind of coward shit is that, man?
You see homey in there in that chair with his tongue pulled through his neck?
You' d better get real.
Reflexes too slow.
Enough of the bullshit, dog.
The name... the new guy, what is his name?
I ain' t tellin 'y' all shit else.
I' m cool with y' all.
These motherfuckers ain' t no joke!
They would scalp me and send my braids to my momma!
What y' all gonna do, take me to jail?
Take me, then.
I' m cold anyway.
Give me a fuckin 'coat.
Put me in the car.
- You sure about that?
- Actin 'like you want to, man.
You' re not gonna tell us anything else?
Nothing else!
- He ain' t gonna talk.
You sure about that?
Here you go.
You think you a player 'cause you got an S600?
Oh, yeah.
Does he think 'cause of this tatt he' s a gangster?
Get your hands off me.
Not 'cause of the played- out platinum.
You don' t think you' re crossing them over, do you?
Back in the day, I would have taken this from you.
That ain' t weight!
Did he think that was weight in that piece of shit?
Let me tell you something... the real motherfuckers don' t move a ki here and there.
They move 50 metric tons a month!
I' m gonna ask you...
Get your gun out of my face, man.
Okay.
We' il do it like this.
Okay.
What' s the name?
Hey, man!
What the fuck is his name?
Hey, man!
- What' s up with your people?
- What' s the fucking name?
I don' t know, man!
Hollywood Jack, man.
My name Monroe Johnson.
I don' t want no problems with y' all, man.
We got it, man.
Come on.
We got ten pages on this thing, all from the same number...
Soleil Tanning Salon.
Tanning salon?
You know damn well you don' t need no tan.
I think that' s him.
Looks Hollywood to me.
Ricky Martin, move over.
Here comes Hollywood Jack.
Hold on.
All right, I' m back.
Yeah, all right.
Yeah, I can do that for you.
Yeah, okay.
Good- bye.
How' s it going?
Good.
Hey...... how long has that clown in the truck been out there?
I don' t know.
- Just go easy, all right?
- I' m just gonna talk to him.
Let' s make this quick.
- Hey, nice truck.
Thanks.
In fact, I was thinking about trading this one in for, like, seven of those.
Really?
I like it better than the S600.
Let me get your license and registration, please.
Yeah, your mud flaps.
You got no mud flaps on this.
It' s a fuckin 'Porsche.
You won' t have to worry when you trade it for the truck.
Did you know that?
Oh, really?
Aw, shit!
- You can get out of your car.
Run this plate for me real quick.
You can go ahead and get out.
Stand by.
I said get out of the car.
This is fucking ridiculous!
Watch your language.
Oh, I' m sorry.
Let me rephrase.
Fuck you!
Aw, shit.
God!
Damn!
Chill, dog.
What does the name Overdose mean to you?
- Over who?
- Overdose!
There' s a human being named Overdose?
Answer the fucking question.
2 - 19- 54.
What the hell is a 2- 1- 9- 5- 4?
Subject has a warrant for jaywalking.
Jaywalking?
I didn' t page anyone.
That' s your salon, right?
The calls came from your salon.
Ninety percent of my clients do narcotics, and they all use that phone.
I don' t know.
Why would Overdose refer to you as his supplier?
- Come again?
- Hollywood Jack.
My civil rights are being violated 'cause some jig drug dealer named Overkill or Oreo or whatever the fuck his name is mentioned a guy named Hollywood Jack?
Call my lawyer, you cocksucker!
Call your lawyer?
God!
You don' t know who that is?
I' il call your lawyer.
I' il beat the shit out of him after I beat the fuck out of you!
What are you doing, man?
Damn!
Chill, boy!
Get the fuck back in the car!
People could be videotaping!
Chill out!
Get back in the car, man!
All we got on this guy is a warrant for jaywalking.
That' s it.
That' s all we got... a fuckin 'jaywalking ticket!
What?
Correct me if I' m wrong, but you called him a "jig," right?
Don' t stupid fucks like you call black people "jigs"?
You fucked up.
Your lawyer?
I' il strike him, too!
Is there a problem?
Everything' s okay.
Everything' s fine.
Can I help you with something?
Everything is fine.
Get the fuck in the truck, man.
Hey, sleepyhead!
What the fuck, homey?
I just want... whoa!
I' m sorry, man.
I just wanted to ask a question.
Could I get a beer or something?
Okay.
What were you doing down at the salon paging some ghetto rat' s crack pad, like, ten times?
Oh, no, hey, fuck it.
Don' t worry about it.
It' s no big deal.
But... what is a big deal is, I spent my afternoon with cops... specifically, the cop you were supposed to take out.
Stupid ass.
When I was little...... my brothers and sisters and me...... we all slept in the same room.
There was no electricity, dirt floors.
When it would rain...... we couldn' t sleep 'cause the raindrops on the tin roof were too loud.
What did you call me down here for?
I might be able to help you.
You had your chance to talk to me.
They killed my wife...... and my son.
When there' s a change at the top, they start over, build their own pipeline.
They' il be looking for new buyers.
So if you could come up with enough money, you' il flush him out.
I can' t do anything about him, but you can.
Romans.
I don' t want any part of Diablo.
I just need to get back to business.
Diablo' s been pulling some bold fuckin 'moves.
Gone!
Streamlinin 'the pipeline.
Now, with us, they' ve got to walk on eggshells.
They fuck with us, they got problems in the jails.
We' il kick their wetback ass in every jail in the state.
Simple.
Don' t worry about us.
We don' t deal with California.
Right.
You' re looking at a shipment like that every month.
Eighteen?
You gotta be kidding me, man.
- What?
- You' re wasting my time.
Wait up.
- Sixteen.
- Sixteen?
I can' t believe I just said that.
- Who pays them prices, cops?
- You got some nuts on you.
You want to do business with me or not?
Aw, fuck, man, you' re killing me here.
All right, look, we can do fifteen.
You know how fuckin 'tight it' s been around here.
Anything less than fifteen, I' m cuttin 'my own throat!
All right.
Jesus!
Hey, guys.
Want a dance, honey?
No, thanks.
We need to loosen him up.
He' s so... serious.
Get the fuck off my lap.
Fuck you!
What' s your deal, bro?
You a faggot?
What did you just say to me?
You call me a fuckin 'faggot?
What the fuck you standing up for?
We got a problem here?
The fuck you looking at?
There' s not a problem.
Come on, sit down.
You kill me, man.
'cause if you are, there' s a whole lot more business for you.
There' s nobody else out there right now.
But don' t ever talk to me like that again.
Don' t ever try to disrespect me.
I don' t care who is around.
Where I' m from, you talk like that, you get punched in the face.
It' s just business.
My people will be there.
You switch keys with them...
- You.
The man that runs this organization calls himself Diablo.
This man is Jack Slayton.
Everything we have leads to him.
What the fuck are you reading?
Does that have anything to do with what we were talking about?
If you don' t want to be here, get out!
Get on with it.
The second move...
The second big move is to flood the whole entire West Coast with more coke than we' ve ever seen before in a straight- up hostile takeover.
If that happens, we' re right back where we started.
We shouldn' t have gone to Mexico.
We can do this.
We can shut them down before they become the next dominant cartel.
They' re ruthless.
Come into your fuckin 'home.
This is Mobile One.
Approaching entry point unsecured.
Good.
Where' s your clowns?
They wanted to meet up with you later, man.
You all set?
Yeah, I like these rims.
Pull in.
I got the all right.
Everybody in place?
We got Mobile Two on the waterfront.
That' s covered.
Exit road is secure.
Got it covered.
There' s your boy.
How you doin '?
Just making sure you' re not wired, that' s all.
What are you doing?
That' s what every cop says.
Hey...
You don' t know me.
You want to do business or not?
- Is that all of it?
You' re lucky, you know.
Yeah, I' m lucky to be back in business.
You know that, don' t you?
Anybody who fucks with Diablo...
Fuck.
Remember that cop who took down the big man?
We took care of his stupid bitch wife.
So you took care of his stupid bitch wife?
The keys are in the car.
Take care.
You killed my wife, you motherfucker?
Red is on waterfront.
Get in here!
You mother!
Hold on.
We' ve got an L. A. Sheriff' s unit coming in.
Think we ought to move in?
- This one ours?
That' s not our guy.
I repeat, that is not our guy.
Move in!
Fuck!
We' ve got an officer down!
Fuckin 'son of a bitch!
Fuck!
Fuck you!
Motherfucker!
Oh, shit!
Yeah, Sean, come in.
Sit down.
Sean, you' re done.
- It was a disaster.
You lost it in the middle of an operation, and now three officers are dead.
Boss, I' m sorry.
I know I fucked up, but you can' t take away my...
I' m sorry, too, Sean.
I' m sorry about...
I' m very sorry about Stacy...
She was like a daughter to me.
What you need is some time to grieve.
You' re going to take six months.
We' il do a psych evaluation at the end of that time, and then we' il see where we' re at.
I remember when you gave me this.
How proud it made me.
You said I was part of the family.
I grieve every day.
You know what it' s like not being able to go into your own home?
I don' t know what the hell I' m doing.
This takes time.
Yo, Sean.
Yo, man, what the hell was that?
They said it was a setup.
What do you think?
I let my emotions take over.
I lost it out there.
I can' t help this anymore.
They took my badge.
You' re beating against a billion- dollar business.
As a cop, that' s impossible.
You must become a monster.
She must have been a good woman.
She was a wonderful woman.
And a wonderful wife.
Met her when I was 15.
I don' t know what would have happened to me if she hadn' t come into my life.
She was all I ever had.
What' s the one thing a man like me won' t touch in this business?
The end product, the end result.
The money.
I know where the money is being safe- housed.
You' il have to follow it to Mexico.
But in Mexico, you' il be alone.
But you must give me your word you' il get me out of here.
I' m not safe here.
I need a transfer.
Tell me where it is.
- You haven' t painted this place yet?
- You sound like Candice.
I' m gonna come by this weekend with a couple of cans of paint.
What' s going on, man?
I just staked out the place.
Staked out what place?
I found out where the money is.
Sean, you should let the department handle this.
I' m gonna be back for you in a little while.
You should really let Frost handle this.
I haven' t seen her.
She' s probably in the house.
All right.
She doesn' t want me here?
Things ain' t been so cool around here.
That freaked Rachel out.
She asked me when was daddy next to be laid up there in the hospital, tubes all in my face and my chest.
I' m sorry about the family thing.
Sexy?
No.
Let me tell you something, man.
We ain' t no gangbangers no more.
I know we' re not gangbangers.
Then what' s with Sexy?
I' m using whatever resources I have.
I' m gonna be back later.
We' il work this out.
Don' t bother to come and get me.
I' m not rollin '.
That' s right.
You fuckin 'up.
You out of control, man.
How am I fuckin 'up?
Everything you do is messy, and I got to clean up after your sloppy ass.
But that' s not my fault if somebody gets out of line.
I' m not fuckin 'with you.
How could you turn your back on me, as long as we been rolling together?
What the fuck would you do?
Ask yourself that.
You talk about the hospital, the nightmares.
What would you do if she died?
You' ve reached the Vetter residence.
Sean, knock it off!
We' re a little busy, but we' il call you back.
Thanks.
Yo, Sean, it' s "D." Pick up.
Yo, Sean.
Yo, man, trust me, you gotta think this through before you make a move.
I' m tellin 'you, think it over, man.
You hear me?
Yo, Sean, what up?
Man, we ready.
Yo, you don' t have to go through with this.
This is how we roll.
Stacy was like family.
Plus I got some new shit I want to test out.
I can' t let you roll without me, man.
It' s on, dog.
I got some extra vests in the car.
Let' s move!
Get the fuck down!
Everybody stay down!
The fuck...?
Move!
Move!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Move!
You thought I wasn' t gonna find you?
Get up, fucker!
Stay down!
- I got these motherfuckers!
I don' t know.
When are you dropping the fuckin 'money?
- Get up!
Make the fuckin 'call.
Use the satellite phone.
Hurry up, man!
And don' t try that smuggler talk.
I speak it fluently.
Yeah, we' re having a party.
I' d like to order some pizza.
Cheer the fuck up!
Party already started.
We' ve got some really hungry people here.
That' s just excellent.
What would you like on your pie?
Everything.
Is that gonna be cash, check, or charge?
Cash, check, or charge?
What' s your location?
Devil' s Playground.
That' s gonna take a little longer than 30 minutes.
I' il see you there.
Into their upright position.
We are about to make our final descent into the middle of fuckin 'nowhere.
¿Qué pasa, Joe?
Is this fuckin 'beautiful or what?
'cause people all around the world, Joe, they just want to look pretty.
'Cept for you, of course.
I' il get the door.
Get the fuck in the car!
All right!
Jesus!
Big Sexy, get rid of him and come back for the truck!
See ya, Joe.
So you' re not a hairdresser.
- Whoa.
- Shut up.
No, he' s not Diablo, but he' s gonna take us to Diablo.
Yeah, I' m gonna take you guys to Diablo... or not.
Fuck you!
You' re not gonna do shit!
Push comes to shove, you' re just a fuckin 'cop!
Don' t bury me!
Come on!
Don' t want to tell the truth, do you?
Okay, bad fuck!
I' ve never seen him.
I don' t know his name.
- But you ran drugs for him.
- That' s the way it works.
He' s fuckin 'lying.... the way it works!
Assuming this worked, what was gonna happen next?
Assuming this worked, what was gonna happen next?
Stop.
They have a house south of the border.
I drop the cash, I just walk.
It' s still gonna be.
Sean, money' s ready.
When we get there, you keep that personality thing going, all right?
You understand me?
¿Qué pasa, fellas?
Oh, just "turbulencia," you know.
Get that for you.
I didn' t tell you?
Yeah.
And we went to the Red over there in Barstow...
Cerveza, nachos, couple of laughs.
You guys need to relax.
No, you got to...
Damn!
Let' s go!
They stopped.
I thought we closed this place down, man.
I know a way in.
We separate, we meet back here.
Shut up!
I' m going left.
I' m going left.
You' re going home.
Diablo.
So this is what the devil looks like.
Why?
Why' d you take my wife?
You think I am the one.
You should have stayed out of Mexico, and perhaps your wife would still be alive.
Die!
Come on.
Let' s go.
It' s not over.
Keep moving!
Stay with me.
Come on.
Stay with me.
Shit!
Come on.
Come on.
Let' s go.
From the wreckage, officials believe the gunmen attacked with semiautomatic weapons, killing two Bureau of Prisons officers and injuring several others.
The specifics are being withheld until the investigation is complete, but we believe that the gunmen were able to spring cartel leader Memo Lucero, who was serving two life sentences for a string of murders and trafficking of narcotics.
I signed the transfer.
It is not your fault that Lucero busted out, okay?
Yeah, but I recommended it.
They say he' s somewhere in Mexico, man.
How do you know that?
I' m taking Frost' s advice.
I' m taking a little time.
Sean, where you at?
I' m in a good place.
I' m recovering.
Okay.
This will only take a second.
I got all the time in the world.
I tracked you for seven years.
You never went to the same place twice.
Until you came home.
I told you you had no idea what you were getting yourself into.
If you' d stayed out of my business, your wife would still be alive.
Your arrogance killed her, not me.
Like your arrogance coming here!
Do you think you can come into my domain and kill me?
If I wanted you dead, you would be.
Finish the job.
I know that you' re with me in spirit.
But I still miss you.
You okay?
Who picked the stone?
We all did.
Yeah, she would have liked that.
Our world has gone now.
Smashed by the wars.
Now I am the keeper of his body, bound here in the egyptian ways,
I followed him as pharaoh, and now ruled 40 years.
I am the victor, but what does it all mean.
When we crossed the 100, 000 man army into India.
He was a God (...) or as close as anything i' ve ever seen.
Tyrant they yelled so easily, i laugh.
No tyrant ever gave back so much.
And what do they know of the world, these school boys, it takes strong man to rule.
Alexander was more, he was permitheous, a friend to man,
He changed the world, before him, there were tribes, and after him,
There was sudden near sense the world, could be ruled by one king, be better for all.
18 Great Alexandrias he built, it was an empire not of land and gold, but of the mind, lennox civilization, oakland, tour,
To dream, big dreams, to believe when Alexander looked you in the eye,
You could do anything, anything.
In his presence, by the light of Apollo, we were better than ourselves.
Truly, i' ve known many great men in my life, but only one colossus,
And only now in old do i understand who this force of nature really was.
Or do I?
Did such a man as Alexander exist?
Of course not, they idolize him, make him better than he was.
Men, all men reach in full, reach in full.
The east, the fast persian empire, ruled almost all the known world.
The west, once great greek city states, thieves, athens, sparta, had fallen from pride.
For a hundred years now, the persian kings had bribed the greeks with their gold,
To fight as mercenaries, it was Philip, the one eyed, that changed all this.
United tribes of illiterate sheep herders, from the high and low lands,
Brought the devious greeks to their knees.
He then turned his eye on persia, where to as said the new great king to arise himself, on his thrown in babylon, feared Philip.
It was from these loins of war, that Alexander was born, in Pella.
Pella Macedonia
Some called his mother queen Olympius, or sorcerous, and said that Alexander was the child of Dienisious, others Zeus, but truly there was not a man in Macedonia who didn' t look at father and son, side by side, and wonder.
& Trust the ones who give you love & & life has just begun son. &
Her skin is water, her tongue is fire.
She' s your friend
If you hesitate she will strike,
Remember that, never hesitate.
Yes, they are like people, you can love them for years, feed them, nurture them, but still, they can turn on you.
(...) babarian, Philip makes a mockery of Dienisious every night.
Women, are the only ones that know Dienisious.
My little achilles.
Stay Alexander down.
What is it you..
6 months to this day.
No no, not here.
Drop it to your king,
King of what, sheepherders men.
* laughing *
Well achilles runs in my veins.
Your are nothing but a drunkin whore.
(...) curse the very name of you.
You think people respect you, you think they dont know your bastards?
Damn your sorcereous soul, keep him here like one of your snakes,
I told you not, i told you not!
It' il be me.
I will not.
Stop stop stop
Your majesty no, in the name of god.
He will never be yours, NEVER! in my womb i carried my avengin.
8 years later
In the world he grew up to, I have come to believe it wasn' t friendship, that Alexander found his hamity.
Fight, (...) of a battle, taste, know the barbarian drive, courage wont be in the lining of your stomach,
It' s in the heart of a man,
We dont need to eat everyday or until your full, we dont need to lie in bed in the morning when you can have some good bean soup to sander,
Of your force night (...) come on Alexander, come on,
Whatever expects you as a king, just because of your father, the first rule of war is to do what you ask your men to do, no more no less.
That' s it, well done my student, good wrestling, that' s what i want, come come come... You did well but you lost, now both of you will congratulate the other, good.
Would you want me to let you win Alexander?
Your right, but I promise you I will beat you one day Hephaistion.
But is it possible, the source of Egypt' s mighty river nile, could rise in these distance mountains of the outer earth?
If so, an experience navigator could find his way, here, by this river east, down into the great plains of india,
Out into the eastern ocean, and into the world, and by this route, up the nile, back to egypt, into the middle sea, and home, to Greece.
Now if only these frogs could look outward and act on their favorite position of the center,
Greece could rule the world.
Why is it master, in myth these lands you speak of are known,
India, where hericlees, and dienisious traveled.
All these men who went east, thesious, Jason, Achilles, were victorious.
From generation to generation there stories have been past on, why?
Unless there was truth to them.
Tales or amazons? no Alexander, only common people believe these tales.
We are here precisly to educate ourselves against such foolish passions.
But if we are superior to the persians as you say, why do we not rule them?
It is, it has always been our greek dream to go east.
The east has a way of swallowing men and their dreams.
Master, master...
Out with it, out with it.
Why are the persians so cool?
That is not the subject for today neokus, but it is true, the oriental races are known for their barbarity, and their slavish devotion to their senses,
Excess in all things, is the undoing of men, that is why we Greeks are superior,
We practice control of our senses, moderation, we hope.
And what of Achilles at Troy master?
Was he not excessive?
Achilles simply lacks restraint he dominates other men so completely, that even when he withdraws from battle crazed with grief, over his dead lover procutules, he seriously endangers his own army,
He is a deeply selfish man.
Then would you say that the local (...) Achilles and Procutules is a corrupting one?
When men lie together in lust, it is a surrender to the passions, and does nothing for the excellence in us, nor does any other, excess kasander, jealousy among them, but when men lie together and knowledge and virtue are pass between them, that is pure, and excellent, when they compete to bring out the good, the best in each other, this is the love between men, that can build the city state and lift us from our frog bottom.
Philip brought (...) Aristotle from Athens to educate our rough people, and growing more ambitious he now planned the invasion of persia.
Is that the best you can do (...) back to the falinx with you,
I' il ride him myself.
He' s been breeding far too often.
My noble king, he' s a high spirit, (...) and worthy of philip of macedonia (...)
Why would i want such a beast, i already have a wife.
Do I seem so old?
Broken neck comes free (...) he' s too nervous for battle.
Buy him for me father, I' il ride him.
And if you dont?
I' il pay for him myself.
With what, your singing voice?
I' il pay you.
I tell you the horse can' t be riden lad, he' s mind is broken.
He can be riden, by me.
If you can rule that horse i' il make him yours, at half the price.
That horse will kill him Philip, will break the boy in two.
Really? perhaps you' il make a musician out of him yet.
The boy does not have the craft Philip, he could hurt himself.
He will have to figure that out for himself, it' s time.
You do not like your shadow do ya?
It is like a dark spirt coming up sketchy,
See that' s us,
It' s just a trick of Apollos, he' s the god of, Sun.
But i will show you how to out win him, you and me together.
Osephilis, that is what i will call you, strong and stubborn,
Osephilis and Alexander, come now, let us ride together.
Ahhhh, he' s got some tight in em yet, (name), (name) for Zeus' s sake, he beat ya man.
Now Osephilles, show them.
My son, my son!
You remember Achilles?
He is my favorite?
Because he loved Procutules and avenged his death.
And his fate?
That he must die young, but with great glory.
Did he have a choice?
Oh yes, live a long life but there would be no glory.
Dream of glory Alexander, your mother encourages you,
There is no glory with out suffering, and this you will not allow.
One day I will be on walls like these.
Permitheous stole the secret of fire and gave it to man,
Made Zeus so angry, chained permitheous to a rock in the great carcasses, and each day, his eagle pecked out the poor man' s liver, each night it grew back again, so that it could be eaten the next day, miserable fate.
Why?
edipus, tore out his eyes,
He found out, murdered his father, married his mother, knowledge that came too late,
The Deer, slaughtered her two children in vengence,
Never easy to escape our mothers Alexander,
All your life be ware of women, by far more dangerous than men.
Ariclees, even after he accomplished his 12 labors,
He was punished for madness, slaughtered his 3 children
Poor Ariclees, great Ariclees, all great must come from loss,
Even you, the gods will one day judge partially.
When I' m king like you one day father.
Do not rush the day boy, you risk all, my father threw me into battle before i knew how to fight,
When i killed my first man he said "now you know" i hated him then,
But I understand why now, a king isn' t born Alexander,
He is made by stealing, by suffering,
A king must know how to hurt those he loves.
It is lonely, ask Ariclees, ask any of them fate is cruel,
No man or woman could be too powerful or too beautiful, without disaster be falling, they laugh when you rise too high,
The glory they give, in the ending they take away,
They make of us slaves.
8 years later
Pregnant so soon, the little whore,
You will marry her in the spring, during the (...) festival,
With himself in regions.
And the remaining members of our family.
I wish, sometimes you could see the light mother,
The truth is he has taken nothing from you that you have not been without.
The only way is to strike, announce your marriage to a macedonian,
Now with get the child of pure blood, he would be one of them not mine,
And he would have no choice but to make you king, there is still king henni.
(...) perfect, if your father that pig had not ravaged her.
Say nothing more of my father, do you hear me say nothing.
Your right, forgive me, a mother loves too much.
Who shall I sing to at night anymore?
I wish, I wish we could spend more time together,
like we used to, when you were the sweetest boy.
There' s never been time mother, since I was a child, i have been groomed to be ever the best.
Aaw my poor child, like Achilles, cursed by your greatness.
Take my strength.
You must never confuse your feelings with your duties Alexander.
A king must make public gestures for the common people.
I know, but you will be 19 this summer, and the girls already say you dont like them,
I understand it is natural for a young man,
But if you go to Asia with out leaving your successor you risk all.
Hephaistion loves me, as I am, not who.
Loves?
In the name of dienisious, understand how philix thinks for your own sake,
Your life hangs in the balance, he' s spies are inside your closest...
Stop!
I am his only worthy son, you crazed woman, he would never hurt me,
Even if (name) had a boy, he would be 20 before he would let him rule.
Yes, and you would be 40, old and wise, like potterman and philix young son would be 20,
Ahhh, come Alexander drink this (...) as only thirst can quench sorrow.
There is only one thing better than winning a battle son,
And that' s the taste of a new woman you will find it far sweeter than (...)
Alexander, Alexander found you the right girl?
I' m chikini.
Huh, what' s your name?
Chikini.
I love you my limp.
And I love you clopis.
Would you prefer a seat cleitis?
* lot of drunken talk *
A toast, a toast!
I drink to our great friends and to our new union,
Macedonia and Greece equals in greatness,
to Philip our king, without home this union could not be possible.
Come (name) Leave some damn air in the hole?
And last I drink to the king' s marriage to my niece (name) a macedonian queen we can be proud of.
To Philip and (name) and to their legitamate sons.
You son of a dog, come then.
This is my wedding not some public brawl, apologize by Zeus before you dishoner me.
He' s afraid the man who called my mother a whore and me a bastard, and i dishoner you?
You listen like your mother, Atlas is my family now the same as you.
Then choose your relatives more carefully, don' t expect me to sit here and watch you shame yourself.
Shame?
He insults me!
Am i not fit to ground my mother walks on?
You dog, questioning your queen.
Shame?
I have nothing to be ashamed of you arrogant brat, i' il marry the girl if i want,
And i' il have as many sons as I want and there' s nothing you or your harpy mother could do about it.
Why drunken man must you think everything I do and say comes from my mother?
Because I know her heart by Hera.
And I see her in your eyes, you come with this thrown too much, now we all know that she will for the mother of yours, wants me dead, well you can both dream boy.
Come Philip, this is the wine talking, leave the boy, wait til morning.
No, I command you, apologize to your kinsmen.
Apologize!
Goodnight old man, and when my mother re- marries, i' il invite you to her wedding.
You will obey me, come here.
And this is the man who is going to take you from Greece to Persia?
He can' t even make it from one couch to the next.
Get out of my palace, your exiled you bastard, banished from the land, your not welcomed here,
You' re no son of mine.
Everything, suddenly changed for him,
His father King Philip was murdered, and Alexander 20 became the new ruler of macedonia.
Several Greek city states, rose up in revolk much to persia' s delight,
And truly Alexander could love like no other, but to betray him was to rouse a vast and frightening anger, (...) several thousand of the men of their tragic city thieves and sold the survivors into slavery.
This has intended stund and defeated the greeks, and though in the end they treated most populations with magnimity it is these exceptions, thieves (...) persia and others,
At 21, Alexander invaded Asia with an army of 40, 000 trained men.
And liberating one city state after the other, he conquered all of western asia, south to egypt, where he was declared Pharoah of egypt, worshiped as a god.
It was in Egypt that the respected oracle siwah declared him the (...).
He finally provoked (name) himself to battle in the heart of the persian empire near babylon.
It was mad, 40, 000 of us against 250, 000 barbarians.
It was the day Alexander had waited for all his life.
Alexander son of a god, it was a myth of course, at least it started as a myth,
I know, i was there, i saw his eyes.
There at the crack of the persian line, we' il go for the head.
Kill their eyes?
The gods have brought him to us at last,
If i die, it' s one macedonian, but the persians they can not move with out authorized his command.
Here, right here we cut the croak of the persian army.
This is madness, you will never get withing 100 paces of him.
Not IF you hold him on the left, my brave parmanion, with your son (name), for just 1, 2 hours tomorrow.
And you unbreakable antagonist the center falinx (name, name, name, name)
if you pin them on the walls of (name) here in the center, their cavalry will follow me out to the right, and when bold cassander breaks, stretching their left, a hole will open,
Then I and my cavalry, a revered cleitis, (name) and (name) will strike through that gap, and deal the death blow to the (...) head.
Alexander even with luck, timing, the gods, we must route them tomorrow, destory their army completely,
Or we be picked apart by bandit tribes on a long journey home.
Right.
You speak of home and retreat, but do you understand how many on, babylon is my new home.
Alexander if we must fight, do so with stealth, use your numbers well, we should attack tonight when they least expect us.
I didn' t cross asia to steal this victory cassander.
No, you are too honorable for that, no dad influence from sleeping with tales of troy under your pillow.
But your father was no lover of homeless.
The lands west of the (...) the hand of his daughter in marriage, since when has a greek ever been given such honors?
This are not honors, are many of the bribes, the greeks have accepted too long,
Do you forget that the man who murdered my father lies across the valley floor.
Come Alexander, we are still not really sure if it was persian gold behind the assassination.
Your father taught you never to surrender your reason, to your passion, now I urge you to regroup,
Fall back to the coast, raise a larger force.
I would if I were permanian, but I am Alexander, and no more than earth has 2 sons will asia bear two kings, these are my terms, and if arias isn' t a coward who hides behind his men, then he will come to me tomorrow,
And when he bows down to Greece,
(...) and lads feast tonight, for tomorrow we will die in hades.
To whom do you pray?
Phobos.
Fear (...).
Or so for dorius.
I have come to believe that fear of death drives all men Ephistian,
This we didn' t learn at school board, it is the cause of all (...) fortunes.
So, mighty (name)
Are you ready for tomorrow' s dawn?
Ah, it' s been too long coming if you ask me, I mean (...)
Good, fear makes men fight better.
Post your centurions alert keep them rested well.
Don' t you worry General, i have been known to sleep with my eyes open as a baby' s ass.
Only cause someone might steal his loot sire.
God be with us your majesty.
Will stay in the ground, with the persian blood of the king.
I alwasy believed Alexander but this seems so much bigger than us.
Did (petropolis) die before Achilles when they stood side by side at seed of Troy?
Petropolis died first.
If you do, if you were to fall Ephistian macedonia would lose a king, i will avenge you and follow you down to the house of death.
I would do the same.
On the eve of battle it is hardest to be alone.
Then perhaps, perhaps this is farewell then, my Alexander.
Fear not Ephistian, we are at the beginning.
Blood makes the world crazed, blood makes the rain fall, blood makes the earth grow.
In blood all man are born and died.
Blood is the food of the gods below.
Help me Osiphilis, today we ride to our destiny.
(name) I remember you the day you took the seed tower at tire, you were a giant, and today how will you fight?
(name) how far was it you threw your men resting at the last olympic games?
Will you match it with your spear?
And Tamander son of men under, a great soldier to my father, i still mourn your brother odius,
Who died so bravely at helicarnusus, what an honor of family you descend from tamander,
You fight for them today.
You have all honored your country and your ancestors,
Where across from us (name) has gathered a vast army...
But ask yourselves, Who is this great king, who pays assassins in gold coins to murder my father, our king, in a most dispicable, and cowardly manner, and who is this great king dorius who enslaves his own men to fight?
Who is this king, but a king of air?
They fight because this king tells them they must.
We are here today, as Macedonian free men.
Will not live to see the sun set over these mountains today,
But I say to you, what every warrior has known since the beginning of time,
Conquer your fear, and I promise you will conquer death.
You will answer, i was here this day at Gagilaya, for the freedom and glory of Greece.
ZUES be WlTH US!!
Where does he go?
Don' t know majesty.
(...)
He makes a mistake (name).
Yes there king.
Macedonian Left (leader giving instructions)
Prepare to repult centurions.
Alexander!!
(...) We must fall back to the gally.
Come (name) ride, ride!!!
Break through the hole!
* instructions *
Go tell Alexander yourself, and if he wont listen then survive me, and avenge his betrayal.
Pay attention lad, your father still watches over you!
Dorius!!!
Dorius!!!!
We can reach those (...) by sunset,
Go (...) catch their eyes by dawn.
Releases the horses.
Alexander, Alexander my father is lost, they have overrun us (...) their into the baggage train.
(name) is crumbling.
Alexander if you chase them, you risk losing your army here.
And if we capture him we gain an empire.
But you will never run far enough.
Your majesty,
Your very brave, what should i call you?
Gloucus my king.
Gloucus and where is your home?
Elyria.
Let your body go lose, think about (...) be brave again Gloucus and you will live on in glory.
Alexander.
Persian empire, the greatest the world had yet known was destroyed.
And Alexander at 25 was now King of all.
Alexander once said to me, we are most alone when we are with the myths.
Babylon, Persia
Alexander was loved by all.
But in the end i believed babylon was a far easier (...) to enter than she was to leave.
Imagine the minds that can see this, with architects and engineers like these,
We can build cities such as we only dreamed.
Aristotle may have called them barbarians but he never saw babylon.
We have enough gold here to support another 3 generations of macedonian armies.
Macedonia will soon corrupt cassander, wealth in great quantities brings the crows.
We will pay them well (name).
You sound like Philip.
Philip never saw babylon.
Look, he didnt advise him.
Alexander, i know you think me a stiff old sog, but whatever our differences, know this day,
Thank you (name),
And i ask you to forgive me, my own anger my pride,
Yes, the grandsons of goat herders we now rule 2 million square miles.
But, none of you fear that this straight fortune may drive us all to destruction.
You over value us, for As long as Dorius breathes he is the legitamite king of asia,
And I but the king of air.
But he has no power alexander, he is lost in the mountains wit no (...)
As long as he is lost (name) he can be believed in.
Only when he is found will be decided.
Seems you already made up your mind Alexander.
We must finish what we failed to do at (...) Parmenium we must hunt dorius if it be to the ends of earth.
That was not your father' s mission.
And I am not my father.
Come on, have you so quickly forgotten, fortune favors the bold.
No wonder Dorius fled, he had this to come back to.
Help me aphroditi, how will i ever go back to (name) after this?
I advise you not to touch (...) here i' il take care of it for you.
Aristotle was perhaps present, with these images foolish with their beauty and degrade our souls.
Great king Alexander.
(name presented)
Noble Alexander.
I come to beg for the lives of my sisters, my mother, my grandmother.
You are not wrong princess (name), he too is alexander.
Please, I plead for my families lives, sell me as a slave great king.
Look now, into my eyes, princess, and tell me how would you like to be treated?
As I am, a princess.
Then so be it, you and your family shall be treated as my family,
No, everything I wish,
Requested.
At the mercy of your enemies, of which you have many,
And (name) accustom now to the part you have given him,
I am certain that he communicates secretly with Parmenian,
Who is dangerous, but beware most of all of those closest to you,
They are like snakes and can be turned.
Cassander is and tibiders son, even cleitis your fathers favorite,
Anton your friend yes, but beware of men who think too much, they blind themselves.
Only Ephistian do i leave out, but all of them you may preach while your mother and yourself,
You live in generous poverty, why wont you ever believe me?
It is only a dark mind like mine that can know these secrets of the heart,
For they are dark Alexander, so dark but in you, the son of Zeus lies the light of the world,
Your companions will be shadows in the underworld,
As the most glorious shining light of youth,
Never will there be an Alexander like you,
Alexander the Great.
I can only help you for they know if they harm you,
They will face my wrath, as queen of babylon.
That is a high ransom she charges for 9 months lodging in the womb.
Bring her Alexander, It will give her such joy.
And on the cracked mirror of her dreams.
Stay with me tonight Ephistian.
I will take my own bath, thank you (name).
The generals question your obsession with arias,
They say it was never meant for you to be king of Asia.
But I' ve seen the future Ephistian, i' ve seen it 1000 times, 1000 faces,
These people want, need change.
Aristotle was wrong about them.
How so?
They smash their enemies skulls and drink from it' s dust, they mate in public,
What can they think, or sing or write, when none can read,
We can connect these lands of (...) and the people,
They draw people into the cities so as to make slaves.
But we freed them Ephistian from the persia where everyone lived as slaves,
To free the people of the world, such would be beyond the glory of archilles,
Beyond hericules, feet will rival pernithius, was always a friend to man.
Remember the fates of these hereos, they suffered greatly.
No we all suffer, your father, mine,
And in the end when its over all that matters is what you have done.
Is there not love in your life?
Alexander?
So many years, so many miles between you,
Who knows these things,
Which am I Ephistian?
I missed you, I need you,
It is you I love Ephistian, no other.
I have stopped that.
And by the sweet breathe of aphroditi,
You want so badly.
You will never lose me Ephistian,
I will be with you always, until the end.
Northeastern Persia
He was dying when we found him sire,
He asked for water, he drank and died.
The great king Dorius had been betrayed by his own commanders.
Crossing even beyond the river oxes, into (place).
For only legend we hereos who once taught,
In fact we were totally lost,
Alexander persissted in breaking every tribe that resisted,
Until the day he received the head of his last enemy in surrender.
For alexander there could be no pretender to the thrown of asia,
Which now (...)
It was here that alexander made one of his most mysterious decisions.
Yes, it is possible!
Man can fly!
No, this can' t be happening!
A chicken?
Even if a flightless bird could ascend into the stratosphere the lack of oxygen would make breathing nearly impossible.
- A dream.
- Precisely.
You go this way!
There he is!
- Come on!
- After him, men!
- He came this way.
I' m sure of it.
- Come on!
Keep up!
Today is the day I will finally achieve what has been deemed impossible.
Man can break the 50- mile- per- hour speed barrier.
And you' re lucky to be a part of it, Pierre.
- It' s Jean Michel, sir.
- Yes.
Or we will die trying.
- Die?
- This is very exciting.
I refuse to be catapulted, electrocuted, or have my internal organs disrupted any longer!
I quit!
He is a very sick man!
The electrocution was not my fault!
We' re looking for a bank robber.
Is there no man brave enough to be my valet?
I' m your new valet.
I must commend the valet service on their impeccable foresight.
But they know I only accept French valets.
Yes.
Oui!
On my father' s side.
Very, very French.
- But your accent.
My mother Chinese and never shuts up.
All the children pick up her accent.
Very well.
Will you be willing to risk your life to challenge the laws of physics?
Uh, and I can sing, too.
- Excellent.
Pop this little hat on.
- He' s got to be in here.
And the throttle in your right hand controls the speed.
- How do I stop?
- Godspeed!
Uh...
Twenty- five miles per hour.
Yes, the pressure' s stable- ish.
We need more speed, man.
Waah!
Forty miles per hour.
Hang on in there, my good man.
Forty- seven.
Forty- eight.
Forty- nine.
Eureka!
Waaah!
I say, I say.
Uh, good morning.
- Over here!
There he is.
Sorry!
Whoa!
- Good morning.
You' il be able to let go any second.
Look out!
Well done!
Good- bye, sir.
It' s been very nice valeting for you.
Please, wait!
With you as my brave valet, I can test all my inventions.
Spread out!
- Cover that...
- Yes.
- I take the job.
- Splendid!
Too kind.
Thank you.

Oh.
"It is with great distress that Scotland Yard announces that the Bank of England has been robbed."
My stolen Jade Buddha stolen?
You blighter!
You gave me every assurance that the Bank of England was impenetrable!
Sir, sir, I said, "lmpregnable."
It' s the same thing, you idiot!
Please, please, not the quills!
Lord Salisbury!
Please contact General Fang and inform her, no Buddha, no deal.
To forgo your obligation would be dishonorable, Lord Kelvin.
A woman in the Royal Academy?
The Jade Buddha was delivered by us to the Bank of England.
- Is absolutely your concern.
Colonel Kitchner, chief of Scotland Yard, please inform General Fang what other items were stolen from the bank.
Nothing else.
Exactly.
It seems your little land dispute has spilled over onto our noble shore.
Kitchner.
My agents will retrieve the Jade Buddha again, Lord Kelvin.
This time, do not let it slip through your fingers.
A female general.
Cor!
- Come away from here.
Can' t we stay?

It' s quite simple.
You' re never to divert one iota from my plans.
I must live my life with total efficiency to maximize my inventing capacity, thus enabling me to do the most I can for mankind.
Uh, Mr. Fogg, you are a noble, precise gentleman.
Thank you.
Uh... sorry.
Passport.
Passepartout.
Bottled light.
A miracle.
Hardly.
Just undiscovered science from an American named Thomas Edison.
It turns on with a whistle.
Please don' t do that.
Ah, I see your eye is drawn to what I hope will one day be my crowning achievement.
A giant moth?
- It' s a flying machine.
- It can fly?
Yes.
But it will, one day.
When I' ve worked out the problem with the steering cables and that damn chicken.
One day it will transport people through the air.
Uh- oh.
I think I' m going to have to make a rule for this.
I will find the fastest way back to China... to make our village safe once again.
Passepartout?
Departure for the Royal Academy of Science in two minutes.
Prepare my urban transport device.
It' s the shoes with little wheels on them.
Clear the way.
Clear the way.
Watch out!
Out of way.
- Gangway.
- Gangway.
- Hey!
That makes it exactly ten minutes before noon.
Gentlemen.
Today I have proved that man can break the 50- mile- per- hour speed barrier without disrupting his internal organs.
Where is your Royal Academy of Science authorization?
What am I thinking?
What a fool.
That would mean that you were a real scientist!
By your definition, a real scientist' s objective would be to prevent man from progress.
We live in a golden age, Fogg.
Everything worth discovering has been discovered.
And on a future filled with motorized vehicles, radio waves, and flying machines!
Confound it!
The bloody Bank of England is a madhouse!
Rumor has it the bloke' s a foreigner.
Nothing.
No.
Actually, they say he was Norwegian.
In fact, though, it was a gang of elderly Norwegians.
I heard it from a very reliable source that it was a gang of redheaded elderly Norwegians with very tiny feet.
It' s about time someone robbed that bank.
Like this very institution, the Bank of England is outdated.
As usual, your contempt for tradition is appalling.
You rest on your traditions, if you prefer, but, as with this bank robber, progress waits for no one.
So now you' re an expert on the bank thief as well.
Give us the benefit of your ineffable wisdom, Fogg.
Twenty- six minutes ago, a ship left Dover for Paris.
From there, the thief takes the Orient Express, where he transfers to a steamer, from Istanbul to India.
In little over a month, that man could be in China.
If we' re to believe Fogg' s calculations, he will have circled the globe and returned to England in a fortnight.
Actually, by my calculations, it would be closer to, uh, exactly 80 days.
Outstanding idea.
Well, then, Fogg,
I...
That would be a fruitless use of my time.
I' m on the verge of numerous... countless... scientific breakthroughs.
You coward.
Admit it.
It cannot be done.
I could do it.
A wager. £10, 000.
Unlike you and your colleagues, money does not inspire me.
I believe every man has his price.
Even you, o noble Phileas Fogg.
There must be something I could offer that would be worthy of your time.
There is.
Your position as head of the Royal Academy.
I could lead Britain and the rest of the world into a new age of progress and discovery.
- Fair enough.
- What?
If he can circumnavigate the globe... in no more than 80 days.
But if he cannot, he must never set foot in this academy again, he must tear down that abhorrent eyesore he calls a laboratory, and he must swear... never to invent again.
Just as I always suspected, Fogg.
You promise so much, yet you deliver... oh, nothing.
- I' il take your wager.
- What did you say?
I' il take your wager!
He did it.
Then it' s done.
A man who has never set foot out of England circling the globe.
This is going to be rather amusing.
History won' t remember your amusement, but it will be hard- pressed to forget the moment I' m standing on the very top step of the Royal Academy of Science.
By the strike of noon, after I, Phileas Fogg, have traveled around the world in 80 days!
Oh, dear.
Mr. Fogg, we all pack and ready to go.
Mr. Fogg, are you in here?
- Mr. Fogg, are you well, sir?
Uh, Passepartout.
Would you... sit with me a moment?
Yes, sir.
I risked everything, my entire life' s work.
For something you believe in.
Nothing could make more sense than that, sir.
You are honorable, Passepartout.
But I' m afraid this was a calamitous lapse of judgment.
- Mr. Fogg?
- Yes?
- Let your family...
- There is no one left to tell.
This house and my inventions are all I have.
And a brave French valet that will help you make it around the world in 80 days.
- You really believe we can succeed?
- Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes!
You' re mad.
We' il be sliced to pieces before we reach India.
We' re with you, sir!
Good luck!
Halt!
- Quite a contraption here, Mr. Fogg.
- Thank you, Inspector.
But I' m afraid I' m gonna have to detain you and your valet until further notice.
This here doohickey is in violation of the city' s new vehicle code.
Vehicle code?
Code 431.
All vehicles must be powered by horses.
Or other indigenous quadruped creatures of the like, excluding giraffes and...
You' re driveling.
Stand aside.
I' m about to embark upon a journey around the world.
Not in this monstrosity, you' re not.
No!
- Mm- mm.
- That' s hot.
It' s...
Ow!
Time to go.
We have a boat to catch.
Stealing a police vehicle is not an acceptable way to begin our journey.
- Not stealing.
Borrowing.
- Excuse us.
We' re borrowing this vehicle to catch our ship to Paris, if someone could inform the appropriate authorities.
Bloody hell!
Me brain' s leakin '!
Ahh!
Damn that nincompoop Fix.
What' s the point of hiring a corrupt police officer if he can' t abuse the law properly?
- Kitchner.
- Sir!
Tell Fix to pack his bags.
- He' s going on a trip.
- Right away, sir.
Hmm.
Smart man.
Passepartout, tell this impudent fellow we must
leave within six and a half hours, or we miss our connection in Constantinople.
Yes, sir.
Please.
We are in a great hurry.
- Passepartout?
- Yes?
In French.
Sacre bleu, la champignon, chateau, bien, françoise, voilà, ooh- la- la, foie de gras.
- What did he say?
- Uh...
He say...
- What?
- He says not to worry.
The next train will leave in five hours.
Good time for sightseeing.
Passepartout, this is a scientific expedition, not a holiday!
Ah!
- Very amazing.
- What?
What does it say?
Eddie Thomason will be showing his inventions.
Thomas Edison?
Here in Paris?
What a chance for you to meet another great inventor.
I would quite like to tell him about my whistle modification.
See?
Exposition.
Science.
I assure you these are not the works of Thomas Edison.
Uh, I think he is somewhere around here.
Wait a moment.
This isn' t science.
This is art.
- Yeah.
- Hmm.
That painting is highly inaccurate.
It' s not supposed to be accurate.
The artist views reality through imagination rather than simply recording it.
It is called "lmpressionism."
Well, um, I' m not impressed.
Trees are not violet, grass is not charcoal, and a man cannot...
fly.
You feel something.
You dream of flying.
Or of naked men.
- Sometimes.
- Ah.
The flying.
N- N- Not the men.
I am glad you like my painting.
Monique La Roche.
Phileas Fogg.
I must say, it' s a lot better than these amateurs.
What did he say?
Oh, no.
Non.
Goodness.
What was that all about?
Well, a wealthy gentleman bought my painting for a lot of money.
Champagne for everyone!
I' m still looking for Mr. Eddie.
Nice painting.
Have you considered a career in schematic drawing?
No.
It would be far too limiting.
At least your work shows genuine promise.
Thank you.
Those I painted many months ago.
I was lacking inspiration.
I found some men to help me find Mr. "Edimon."
- This way.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Get him!
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Oh, it' s terrible, no?
No, no, it' s...
- clever.
- Oh.
Hmm.
Yes.
- He' s a clown.
- Mm- hmm.
And yet... he' s incredibly angry.
The irony is, uh, terrifying.
- Is that good?
- Is it?
Ah, this is interesting.
Without opposable thumbs, a dog could never play poker.
Yes, they can.
Where have you seen a dog playing poker?
Right there.
Perhaps I' m not the best judge.
Bandits!
They come to take away all the paintings!
- Quickly!
Come this way!
- Passepartout!
Go, go, go!
It is magnificent.
Mr. Fogg, his house is even bigger than yours.
His collection, his taste...
It is exquisite.
Yes, it is.
Not good.
Very old.
Look.
Broken.
And where is His Highness?
Oh.
The prince is also a talented musician.
If I did nothing but lounge about the palace,
I' d learn to pluck a few notes.
Let' s make this brief.
I' il pose for photographs, wearing a turban, holding an atlas...
Mademoiselle.
How magical that our paths should cross.
Do you believe in fate?
Is that what you call it when one stops a train and kidnaps its passengers?
Phileas Fogg.
Please forgive me, but I feel like Aphrodite herself descended to Earth.
What is a ravishing woman like you...
- I never think when I' m naked.
- I do.
In the bath.
- Yes.
Don' t touch it!
- That is my most treasured possession.
I was just...
Don' t even point.
Rodin.
Yes.
A Rodin.
Oh.
I have never seen a more beautiful... muscular form.
Well, I can assure you, I' m in much better shape now.
Incroyable.
It is a sculpture of you!
Yes.
Your pal, Rodin. "
- Come, my dear.
Let us dine.
- Yes.
Ah, Mr. Fogg, please join us.
We are on a tight schedule.
We will join you, actually.
I realized I forgot to put on my bathing suit.
I' m such a fool.
Always embarrassing myself in front of visiting dignitaries.
But you know how that can be, right, Phil?
Uh, yes.
Uh, it' s Phileas, actually.
I heard you' re an inventor.
Well, I try to apply myself to thinking of new ways to help better mankind, if that' s what you mean.
Well, I' m not an inventor, but I did develop a new way of irrigating dry land so that no one in my kingdom ever has to be hungry.
Oh.
Mr. Fogg invented wheelie shoes.
Not now, Passepartout.
- Miss La Roche.
It is mesmerizing, the way your face illuminates.
Although I' ve noticed a certain
luminescent glow about her complexion when she' s drawing.
And sometimes, when she' s... concentrating on her latest work, her ears will actually flutter.
- It' s rather fetching.
- Guess who else was in this bath.
U. S. President Rutherford B. Hayes.
Shouldn' t we be going?
We have a schedule to keep.
Thank you for your hospitality.
Yes.
Very well.
- Hmm?
Yes.
Wife number seven.
- You have seven wives?
- One for each day of the week.
- This is absolutely ridiculous!
- No more talk!
Prince Hapi has spoken!
Well, we did say one drink.
Passepartout, we' re leaving.
I can tell when we' re not wanted.
Monsieur Fogg!
Do Tuesdays work for you?
- Good- bye.
- Thank you!
No!
Halt!
Or Hapi gets smashed!
Please!
Miss La Roche, please join us, if you will.
- All of you, drop your weapons.
- Do as he says!
- Get in the tent.
- Everybody!
- Now!
- Let' s go.
Now, take off your clothes and throw them...
I assure you the statue is not armed... harmed in any way.
Get them!
His arm!
Thank you, Phileas.
That was very heroic.
Yes, and needlessly time- consuming.
This is exactly why I should never have let you come along.
Kill them!
No!
Sir!
- A- ha!
- According to him, the bank thief and Fogg' s valet are the same man.
Fogg doesn' t realize he' s transporting the bank thief!
Or does he?
Wouldn' t you say, Lord Rhodes?
Indeed, Lord Salisbury.
Eh, evading arrest, stealing a police vehicle, sounds rather incriminating to me.
One can almost deduce this entire bet was merely a ruse to facilitate his escape.
- Don' t you agree, Lord Kelvin?
- Yes.
Brilliant, Lord Salisbury.
I shall name a beef- related entrée after you in your honor!
Kitchner!
- Sir!
- Inform your men at Scotland Yard that Phileas Fogg is without a doubt the man who robbed the Bank of England!
- Where are they now?
- They' re taking a train across India, from Bombay to Calcutta.
Thank God we own India!
I want their faces in every police station, army barracks, post office, railway station and outhouse in India!
We' re going to stop Fogg and get my Jade Buddha back by any means necessary!
Agra is where we will capture them!
Intercept them at Agra!
Carry on, Cutter!
Move it!
Fall in!
And they were the greatest kung fu boxers.
Ten Tigers of Canton.
Brothers in arms.
They fought to keep order and justice in China.
The most famous of Ten Tigers is Wong Fei Hung.
Armed with only bamboo sticks...
It' s salivating on... please.
Is this your goat?
Did they really fight like tigers?
Each Tiger have their own animal fighting style.
Like tiger.
Snake.
Where are my calculations?
Monkey!
The goat!
Passepartout, I' m being attacked by a ferocious animal!
- It has small horns.
- Sorry, Mr. Fogg.
Please keep that inconsiderate beast away from me.
And refrain from ridiculous anecdotes.
Why do you not like his story, Mr. Frog?
It' s Fogg.
Phileas Fogg.
- animals?
- It is famous legend.
- A ridiculous legend.
- Most legends are born from truth.
But all truths are born from facts.
Solid, tangible facts that can be calculated and written down on paper.
And then eaten by a goat.
Mr. Feelsillious, when I tell the story of the man who circled the entire world in 80 days, would that not be a legend?
Only if the man' s name was Feelsillious Frog.
- What the blazes is it now?
- Come this way!
Come on!
Get 'em!
Find these men!
They seem to think we robbed the Bank of England.
Preposterous.
This is a desperate attempt by Lord Kelvin to impede my journey.
I am a British citizen.
I have nothing to fear.
Listen up!
Have you seen these men?
Any word on the bank thieves, sir?
They were on the train.
Keep your rifles ready.
They won' t get past us, sir!
Ladies, have you seen these two men?
Look closely.
They' re very dangerous.
They' re everywhere!
This is not going to work!
- Just act like ladies.
Hello.
Hello!
- I feel faint.
- Phileas, women are not that weak!
No, but I am.
Hello, darling.
What can I do for you, eh?
What nice hand, nice eye, nice hair...
Hang about!
Mr. Fogg, what are you doing?
This is no time to sleep.
Stop, stop.
Go, go, go!
Get us out of Agra quickly.
Passepartout, we did it.
Hey, wrong way.
Ah!
Phileas?
No!
Ah!
Ahhh!
- What are you doing?
- Now I gotcha!
Hand over the Jade Buddha!
You' re under arrest!
Watch me plums!
Ooh!
Now you get him very mad!
Let' s go.
Stop, or I' il arrest you as well!
Run!
- Which way?
- Down!
Again!
Jump!
- Go, go, go!
- What' s upsetting him?
- He wants the Jade Buddha!
- Please, please.
- My husband will be home soon.
- Phileas!
Ay!
Phileas, help!
Leave her alone!
I' il protect you!
Ah!
I' m here, my dear.
Uh, that stumble was simply to buy me time.
This cane is not as it appears.
If I depress this button, it would deploy a weapon more deadly than yours.
This... is... a strange knife.
Isn' t it a sextant?
Huh.
- Are you all right, my dear?
Ah!
You men, come with me!
Oh.
We should run.
- What, now?
- Mm- hmm.
Yes, we should run.
- Break down the door!
No, not me brains!
- Give me the Jade "Bu- ddha"!
- Okay, okay.
What' s "Bu- ddha"?
Get ready to jump!
Now!
It is him, the Englishman who robbed the Bank of England!
He' s escaping in that palkee- garry!
They' il check all trains heading east.
If we could make it to the coast, we can' t sail into Singapore or Hong Kong.
- They' re both British colonies.
Rachel, let me see.
- Can I see?
- Finders keepers.
And I found it.
In my garden.
Finders keepers.
Bruce?
Bruce?
Mom!
Mr. Alfred!
Did you have dream?
Nightmare.
Worse than this place?
They are going to fight you.
- Until they kill you.
Can they kill me before breakfast?
You are in hell, little man.
And I am the devil.
You' re practice.
Solitary.
- Why?
- For protection.
- I don' t need protection.
- Protection for them.
Get in.
Are you so desperate to fight criminals...... that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time?
Actually, there were seven of them.
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.
How do you know my name?
The world is too small for someone like Bruce Wayne to disappear...... no matter how deep he chooses to sink.
Who are you?
My name is merely Ducard, but I speak for Ra' s al Ghul...... a man greatly feared by the criminal underworld.
A man who can offer you a path.
What makes you think I need a path?
Someone like you is only here by choice.
You have been exploring the criminal fraternity...... but whatever your original intentions...... you have become truly lost.
And what path can Ra' s al Ghul offer?
The path of a man who shares his hatred of evil...... and wishes to serve true justice.
The path of the League of Shadows.
- You' re vigilantes.
- No, no, no.
A vigilante is just a man lost in the scramble for his own gratification.
He can be destroyed or locked up.
But if you make yourself more than just a man...... if you devote yourself to an ideal...... and if they can' t stop you...... then you become something else entirely.
Which is?
Legend, Mr. Wayne.
Tomorrow, you will be released.
If you are bored of brawling with thieves and want to achieve something...... there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes.
Pick one of these flowers.
If you can carry it to the top of the mountain...... you may find what you were looking for in the first place.
And what was I looking for?
Only you can know that.
You turn back.
You go back.
Ra' s al Ghul?
Wait.
What are you seeking?
I seek...... the means to fight injustice.
To turn fear...... against those who prey on the fearful.
DUCARD To manipulate the fears in others...... you must first master your own.
Are you ready to begin?
I can barely stand.
Death does not wait for you to be ready!
Death is not considerate or fair!
And make no mistake, here you face death.
Tiger.
Jujitsu.
Panther.
You' re skilled.
But this is not a dance.
But not of me.
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...
... what do you fear?
Bruce?
It' s okay.
It' s okay.
You' il be okay.
Will we be needing an ambulance, Master Wayne?
No, I' il set the bone and take him for an x- ray later.
Very good, sir.
- I' m very sorry, sir.
I' ve told - Don' t worry.
It' s fine.
Took quite a fall, didn' t we, Master Bruce?
And why do we fall?
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.
The bats again?
You know why they attacked you, don' t you?
- They were afraid of you.
- Afraid of me?
All creatures feel fear.
Even the scary ones?
Especially the scary ones.
I got something to show you.
- You think your mother will like them?
- I think it' s time to get up.
- Maybe.
No going back to bed.
Did you build this train, Dad?
Gotham' s been good to our family, but the city' s been suffering.
People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times.
So we built a new, cheap, public transportation system to unite the city.
And at the center...... Wayne T ower.
Is that where you work?
- No, I work at the hospital.
I leave the running of our company to much better men.
- Better?
- Well...... more interested men.
Can we go?
Please.
Let' s go.
- What' s wrong, Bruce?
It was me.
I just needed some fresh air.
A little bit of opera goes a long way.
Right, Bruce?
Let' s go.
Wallets, jewelry.
Come on, fast.
That' s fine.
Fast.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
Here you go.
It' s fine.
It' s fine.
Now just take it and go.
- I said, jewelry.
Thomas!
Bruce.
It' s okay.
Don' t be afraid.
Is this your father' s?
It' s okay.
Come here.
There you go.
It' s okay.
It' s okay.
Gordon.
Good news.
We got him, son.
We' il be watching the empire.
When you grow up, it' il be waiting for you.
I thought I might prepare a little supper.
- Very well.
- Alfred?
- Yes, Master Bruce?
- It was my fault, Alfred.
- I made them leave the theater.
- If I hadn' t gotten scared...
- It was nothing that you did.
It was him, and him alone.
Do you understand?
I miss them, Alfred.
I miss them so much.
So do I, Master Bruce.
So do I.
And do you still feel responsible for your parents' death?
My anger outweighs my guilt.
Come.
You have learned to bury your guilt with anger.
I will teach you to confront it and to face the truth.
You know how to fight six men.
We can teach you how to engage 600.
You know how to disappear.
We can teach you to become truly invisible.
Invisible?
The ninja understands that invisibility is a matter of patience and agility.
Always mind your surroundings.
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.
- As weapons?
- Or distractions.
Theatricality and deception are powerful agents.
You must become more than just a man in the mind of your opponent.
Who is he?
- He was a farmer.
Then he tried to take his neighbor' s land and became a murderer.
- Now he is a prisoner.
- What' il happen to him?
Justice.
Crime cannot be tolerated.
Criminals thrive on the indulgence of society' s understanding.
Your parents' death was not your fault.
It was your father' s.
Anger does not change the fact that your father failed to act.
- The man had a gun.
- Would that stop you?
I' ve had training.
The training is nothing!
Will is everything!
The will to act.
Yield.
You haven' t beaten me.
You have sacrificed sure footing for a killing stroke.
Rub your chest.
Your arms will take care of themselves.
You are stronger than your father.
You didn' t know my father.
But I know the rage that drives you.
That impossible anger strangling the grief...... until the memory of your loved one is just...... poison in your veins.
And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed...... so you' d be spared your pain.
I wasn' t always here in the mountains.
Once, I had a wife.
She was taken from me.
Like you, I was forced to learn there are those without decency...... who must be fought without hesitation, without pity.
Your anger gives you great power.
But if you let it, it will destroy you...... as it almost did me.
- What stopped it?
- Vengeance.
That' s no help to me.
Why, Bruce?
Why could you not avenge your parents?
Will you be heading back to Princeton after the hearing, sir...... or can I persuade you to stay on for a day or two?
I' m not heading back at all.
You don' t like it there?
- I like it fine.
They just don' t feel the same way.
- I' ve prepared the master bedroom.
My room will be fine.
With all due respect, sir, Wayne Manor is your house.
No, Alfred, it' s my father' s house.
- Your father is dead.
- This place is a mausoleum.
If I have my way, I' il pull the damn thing down brick by brick.
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered six generations of your family.
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?
It' s not your family.
I give a damn because a good man once made me responsible...... for what was most precious to him...... in the whole world.
Miss Dawes has offered to drive you to the hearing.
She probably hopes to talk you out of going.
Should I just bury the past out there with my parents, Alfred?
I wouldn' t presume to tell you what to do with your past, sir.
Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future.
Haven' t given up on me yet?
Never.
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk on the top shelf.
Hasn' t he noticed you' re tall enough to reach now?
Old habits die hard, I guess.
- Never used to stop us anyway.
- No, it didn' t.
How' s your mom?
She misses this place.
So do I.
But it' s nothing without the people who made it what it was.
- Now there' s only Alfred.
- I' m not staying, Rachel.
- You' re just back for the hearing.
Bruce, I don' t suppose there' s any way to convince you not to come.
Someone at this proceeding...... should stand for my parents.
We all loved your parents, Bruce.
- What Chill did is unforgivable.
- Then why is your boss letting him go?
In prison, he shared a cell with Carmine Falcone.
He learned things, and he will testify in exchange for early parole.
Rachel, this man killed my parents.
I cannot let that pass.
And I need you to understand that, please.
Okay.
The depression hit working people, like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.
His crime was appalling, yes, but it was motivated not by greed...... but by desperation.
Given the 14 years served, as well as his extraordinary level of cooperation...... with one of this office' s most important investigations...... we strongly endorse his petition for early release.
Mr. Chill?
Your Honor...... not a day goes by that I don' t wish I could take back what I did.
Sure, I was desperate, like a lot of people back then...... but that don' t change what I did.
I gather there is a member of the Wayne family here today.
Has he got anything to say?
He' s coming out the side!
He' s coming out the side, guys!
Joe!
Hey, Joe!
Falcone says hi.
Come on, Bruce.
We don' t need to see this.
I do.
The DA couldn' t understand why Judge Faden insisted...... on making the hearing public.
Falcone paid him off to get Chill out in the open.
Maybe I should thank them.
- You don' t mean that.
- What if I do, Rachel?
My parents deserved justice.
You' re not talking about justice.
You' re talking about revenge.
- No, they' re never the same.
Revenge is about you making yourself feel better.
- It' s why we have an impartial system.
- Your system is broken.
You care about justice?
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.
This city is rotting.
They talk about the depression as if it' s history.
Things are worse than ever here.
Falcone floods our streets with crime and drugs...... preying on the desperate, creating new Joe Chills every day.
Falcone may not have killed your parents, Bruce...... but he' s destroying everything that they stood for.
You wanna thank him for that?
We all know where to find him.
As long as he keeps the bad people rich...... and the good people scared, no one' il touch him.
Good people like your parents, who' il stand against injustice, they' re gone.
What chance does Gotham have when the good people do nothing?
- I' m not one of your good people, Rachel.
- What do you mean?
All these years, I wanted to kill him.
Now I can' t.
Your father would be ashamed of you.
You' re taller than you look in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.
No gun?
I' m insulted.
- You could' ve just sent a thank- you note.
- I didn' t come here to thank you.
I came to show you that not everyone in Gotham' s afraid of you.
Only those who know me, kid.
Look around you.
You' il see two councilmen...... a union official, couple off- duty cops...... and a judge.
I wouldn' t have a second' s hesitation of blowing your head off in front of them.
Now, that' s power you can' t buy.
That' s the power of fear.
I' m not afraid of you.
Because you think you got nothing to lose.
But you haven' t thought it through.
You haven' t thought about your lady friend in the DA' s office.
You haven' t thought about your old butler.
People from your world...... have so much to lose.
Now, you think because your mommy and your daddy got shot...... you know about the ugly side of life, but you don' t.
You' ve never tasted desperate.
You' re...
You' re Bruce Wayne, the prince of Gotham.
You' d have to go 1000 miles to meet someone who didn' t know your name.
So don' t come here with your anger, trying to prove something to yourself.
This is a world you' il never understand.
And you always fear...... what you don' t understand.
All right.
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
I' il give you that.
More than your old man anyway.
In the joint, Chill told me about the night he killed your parents.
He said your father begged for mercy.
Begged.
Like a dog.
Should' ve tipped better.
- For what?
- Your jacket.
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.
Let me have it.
It' s a nice coat.
Be careful who sees you with that.
- They' re gonna come looking for me.
Everyone.
It' s a nice coat.
When you lived among the criminals, did you start to pity them?
The first time I stole so that I wouldn' t starve, yes.
I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong.
And when I traveled...... I learned the fear before a crime...... and the thrill of success.
But I never became one of them.
You' re a criminal.
I' m not a criminal
Tell that to the guy who owned these.
You' ve traveled the world to understand the criminal mind...... and conquer your fears.
But a criminal is not complicated.
And what you really fear is inside yourself.
You fear your own power.
You fear your anger...... the drive to do great or terrible things.
Now you must journey inwards.
You are ready.
Breathe.
Breathe.
Breathe in your fears.
Face them.
T o conquer fear, you must become fear.
You must bask in the fear of other men.
And men fear most what they cannot see.
You have to become a terrible thought.
A wraith.
You have to become an idea!
Feel terror cloud your senses.
Feel its power to distort.
T o control.
And know that this power can be yours.
Embrace your worst fear.
Become one with the darkness.
Focus.
Concentrate.
Master your senses.
You cannot leave any sign.
I haven' t.
Impressive.
We have purged your fear.
You are ready to lead these men.
You are ready to become a member of the League of Shadows.
But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice.
No.
I' m no executioner.
Your compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share.
That' s why it' s so important.
It separates us from them.
You want to fight criminals.
This man is a murderer.
- This man should be tried.
By whom?
Corrupt bureaucrats?
Criminals mock society' s laws.
You know this better than most.
You cannot lead these men...... unless you are prepared to do what is necessary to defeat evil.
And where would I be leading these men?
Gotham.
As Gotham' s favored son...... you will be ideally placed to strike at the heart of criminality.
- How?
- Gotham' s time has come.
Like Constantinople or Rome before it...... the city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice.
It is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.
This is the most important function of the League of Shadows.
It is one we' ve performed for centuries.
Gotham...... must be destroyed.
You can' t believe in this.
Ra' s al Ghul rescued us from the darkest corners of our own hearts.
What he asks in return is the courage to do what is necessary.
I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men like this...... but I will not become an executioner.
Bruce, please.
For your own sake, there is no turning back.
- What are you doing?
- What' s necessary, my friend.
I will tell him you saved his life.
Master Wayne, you' ve been gone a long time.
- Yes, I have.
- You look very fashionable.
Apart from the mud.
Are you coming back to Gotham for long, sir?
As long as it takes.
I want to show the people...... their city doesn' t belong to the criminals and the corrupt.
In the depression, your father nearly bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...... combating poverty.
He believed his example could inspire the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.
Did it?
In a way.
Their murder shocked the wealthy and the powerful into action.
People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy.
I can' t do that as Bruce Wayne.
As a man...... I' m flesh and blood, I can be ignored, destroyed.
But as a symbol...
As a symbol, I can be incorruptible.
- I can be everlasting.
- What symbol?
Something elemental...... something terrifying.
I assume that as you take on the underworld...... this symbol is a persona to protect those you care about from reprisals?
You' re thinking about Rachel?
Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself.
Have you told anyone I' m coming back?
I couldn' t figure the legal ramifications of bringing you back from the dead.
- Dead?
- You' ve been gone seven years.
You had me declared dead?
Actually, it was Mr. Earle.
He' s taking the company public.
He wanted to liquidate your majority shareholding.
Those shares are worth quite a bit of money.
Well, it' s a good thing I left everything to you, then.
Quite so, sir.
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like.
Just bring it back with a full tank.
In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much a danger to himself as to others...... and prison is probably not the best environment for his rehabilitation.
- Dr. Crane.
- Miss Dawes.
You think a man who butchers people for the mob doesn' t belong in jail?
I would hardly have testified to that otherwise, would I?
This is the third of Falcone' s thugs you' ve had declared insane...... and moved into your asylum.
The work offered by organized crime must have an attraction to the insane.
Or the corrupt.
Mr. Finch.
You should check with Miss Dawes here...... just what implications your office has authorized her to make.
If any.
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing, Carl?
Looking out for you.
Falcone has half the city bought and paid for.
- Drop it.
- How can you say that?
Because as much as I care about getting Falcone, I care more about you.
That' s sweet.
We' ve been through all that.
Blessed bat again, sir.
They nest somewhere in the grounds.
No more favors.
Someone is sniffing around.
Hey, I scratch your back, you scratch mine, doc.
I' m bringing in the shipments.
We are paying you for that.
Maybe money isn' t as interesting to me as favors.
I am more than aware that you are not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.
But you know who I' m working for, and when he gets here -
He - He' s coming to Gotham?
Yes, he is.
And when he gets here, he' s not going to wanna hear...... that you' ve endangered our operation just to get your thugs out of jail time.
- Who' s bothering you?
- There' s a girl at the DA' s office.
- We' il buy her off.
- Not this one.
Idealist, huh?
Well, there' s an answer to that too.
- I don' t want to know.
- Yes, you do.
No, we are showing very healthy growth in these sectors.
I don' t think Thomas Wayne would have viewed heavy- arms manufacture...... as a suitable cornerstone for our business.
Well, that' s 20 years ago, Fredericks.
I think after 20 years we can allow ourselves...... to stop thinking about what Thomas Wayne would have done.
Good morning, Mr. Earle' s office.
Yes, he' s confirmed for the dinner tomorrow evening.
Good morning.
I' m here to see Mr. Earle.
Name?
Bruce Wayne.
Thomas would probably not have taken the company public.
But that is what we, as responsible managers, are going to do.
Jessica?
Jessica?
Where are you?
Eye on the ball, and...
- Why is no one answering the phone?
It' s Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.
I' m sure they' il call back.
Bruce?
You' re supposed to be dead.
I' m sorry to disappoint.
- I need you to take a look at this.
- Have you seen him yet?
- Who?
- Wayne.
It' s been all over the news.
He' s back.
I' m sure you realize I can' t stop the big machine.
Too many wheels turning.
- We' re going public.
- I understand.
And I' il be handsomely rewarded for my shares.
I' m not looking to interfere.
- I am looking for a job.
- Oh?
I just want to get to know the company that my family built.
Any ideas where you would start?
Applied Sciences caught my eye.
Fox' s department.
I' il let him know you' re coming.
You look like him.
Your dad.
You' re the only one left of the Wayne family.
This is where you belong.
Welcome home.
Environmental procedures, defense projects, consumer products.
All prototypes.
None in production.
- On any level whatsoever.
- None?
What did they tell you this place was?
They didn' t tell me anything.
Earle told me exactly what it was when he sent me down here.
Dead end.
Place to keep me from causing the board any more trouble.
Come on.
- You were on the board?
- When your father ran things.
- You knew my father?
- Oh, yeah.
Helped him build his train.
Here we are.
Kevlar utility harness.
The 350- pound test monofilament.
Wonderful project, your dad' s train.
Routed it right into Wayne T ower, along with the water and power utilities.
Kind of made Wayne T ower the unofficial center of Gotham City.
Of course, Earle let it go to rot.
Here we are.
Nomex survival suit for advanced infantry.
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.
- T ear- resistant?
- This sucker will stop a knife.
- Bulletproof?
- Anything but a straight shot.
- Why didn' t they put it into production?
- Bean counters didn' t think...... a soldier' s life was worth 300 grand.
So, what' s your interest in it, Mr. Wayne?
I want to borrow it.
For spelunking.
Spelunking?
Yeah, you know, cave diving?
You expecting to run into much gunfire in these caves?
Look, I' d rather Mr. Earle didn' t know about me borrowing -
Mr. Wayne...... the way I see it...... all this stuff is yours anyway.
Give it a try.
Charming.
At least you' il have company.
This must be the lowest foundation of the southeast wing.
Your great- great- grandfather was involved in the Underground Railroad...... secretly transporting freed slaves to the North...... and I suspect these caverns came in handy.
Come up here!
I can see everything all right from down here, sir, thank you.
We order the main part of this cowl from Singapore.
Via a dummy corporation.
Indeed.
And then, quite separately...... we place an order to a Chinese company for these.
- Put it together ourselves.
- Precisely.
They' il have to be large orders, to avoid suspicion.
- How large?
- Say 10, 000.
- Well, at least we' il have spares.
- Yes.
Don' t suppose you want a taste.
I just keep offering, thinking maybe someday you' il get wise.
There' s nothing wise in what you do, Flass.
Well, Jimbo, you don' t take the taste, makes us guys nervous.
I' m no rat.
In a town this bent, who' s there to rat to anyway?
Don' t turn around.
You' re a good cop.
One of the few.
What do you want?
Carmine Falcone brings in shipments of drugs every week.
Nobody takes him down.
Why?
He' s paid up with the right people.
What will it take to bring him down?
Leverage on Judge Faden...... and a DA brave enough to prosecute.
Rachel Dawes.
Who are you?
Watch for my sign.
You' re just one man?
Now we' re two.
We?
Freeze!
What the hell was that?
Just some nut.
Well, what is it today?
More spelunking?
No.
Today it' s BASE- jumping.
BASE- jumping.
- That like parachuting?
- Kind of.
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?
You know, I think I have just the thing.
It' s called memory cloth.
Notice anything?
Regularly flexible...... but put a current through it... -... molecules realign, it becomes rigid.
Can be tailored to fit any structure based on a rigid skeleton.
T oo expensive for the Army?
I don' t think they tried to market it to the billionaire, BASE- jumping crowd.
- Look, Mr. Fox.
- Yes, sir?
If you' re uncomfortable -
Mr. Wayne, if you don' t want to tell me exactly what you' re doing...... when I' m asked, I don' t have to lie.
But don' t think of me as an idiot.
Fair enough.
What' s that?
The Tumbler?
Oh, you wouldn' t be interested in that.
She was built as a bridging vehicle.
During combat, two of these would jump over a river, towing cables.
Over here on the throttle, flip that open and throttle up.
This will boost you into a rampless jump - Not now!
Not - Not now, sir.
Afterburner disengaged.
We never could get the damn bridge to work...... but this baby works just fine.
So, what do you think?
Does it come in black?
I need you at the docks Thursday.
- I don' t want any trouble...
-... with the last shipment.
- Sure.
Word on the street is you got a beef with somebody in the DA' s office.
- Is that right?
- And that there' s a fat prize...... waiting for anybody willing to do anything about it.
So, what' s your point, Mr. Flass?
Have you seen the girl?
FLASS It' s a cute little assistant DA.
Don' t you think that' s a little too much heat to bring down, maybe?
- Even for this town.
- Never underestimate Gotham City.
People get mugged coming home from work every day of the week.
Sometimes - Sometimes things just go bad.
It' s a problem with the graphite, sir.
The next 10, 000 will be up to specifications.
- At least they gave us a discount.
- Quite.
In the meantime, sir, may I suggest you try to avoid landing on your head?
Why bats, Master Wayne?
Bats frighten me.
It' s time my enemies shared my dread.
What is this?
Continue.
Looks fine out there.
The bears go straight to the dealers.
Y eah, and the rabbits go to the man in the Narrows.
- What' s the difference?
- Ignorance is bliss, my friend.
Don' t burden yourself with the secrets of scary people.
Steiss.
Steiss?
What?
What the...?
I better check it.
There' s a problem out here.
You better bail.
Where are you?!
Here.
Take a ride.
Oh, shit.
What the hell are you?
I' m Batman.
Nice coat.
Thanks.
Hold it.
That' s right, you better run.
Falcone sent them to kill you.
- Why?
- You rattled his cage.
- What' s this?
- Leverage.
- For what?
- T o get things moving.
Who are you?
Someone like you.
Someone who' il rattle the cages.
Ma' am?
Everything okay?
Falcone' s men?
- Does it matter?
We' il never tie him to it anyway.
I wouldn' t be too sure of that.
What the hell is that?
Cut him down.
Unacceptable.
Now, I don' t care if it' s rival gangs, Guardian Angels...... or the goddamn Salvation Army...... get them off the street and off the front page.
They say it was just one guy.
Or a creature.
It was some asshole in a costume.
- Yeah?
- This guy did deliver us...... one of the city' s biggest crime lords.
No one takes the law into their own hands in my city.
Understand?
No way to bury it now.
There' s still Judge Faden.
- I' ve got Faden covered.
- What about this bat they babble about?
Even if these guys will swear to being thrashed by a giant bat...... we' ve got Falcone at the scene.
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.
This bat character gave us everything.
Let' s do it.
- Bats are nocturnal.
Bats may be.
But even for billionaire playboys, 3: 00 is pushing it.
The price for leading a double life, I fear.
Your theatrics made an impression.
Theatricality and deception...... are powerful weapons, Alfred.
If those are to be the first of many injuries to come...... it would be wise to find a suitable excuse.
Polo, for instance.
I' m not learning polo, Alfred.
Strange injuries, a nonexistent social life.
These things beg the question...... as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne do with his time and his money.
What does someone like me do?
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.
Buy things that are not for sale.
Who knows, Master Wayne, you start pretending to have fun...... you might even have a little by accident.
Sir.
- We have a situation.
- All right.
The Coast Guard picked up one of our cargo ships last night...... heavily damaged, all crew missing, probably dead.
The ship was carrying a prototype weapon.
It' s a microwave emitter.
It' s designed for desert warfare, but it -
It looks like somebody...
... turned it on.
It uses focused microwaves to vaporize the enemy' s water supply.
The damage to the ship was catastrophic.
The weapon itself is...
Missing?
Yeah.
Nice car.
You should see my other one.
He' s done something the police never have.
You can' t take the law into your own hands.
Well, at least he' s getting something done.
Bruce, help me out here.
- Huh?
Well, a guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues.
But he' s put Falcone behind bars.
Now the cops want him.
What does that tell you?
They' re jealous.
Sir, the pool is for decoration...... and your friends do not have swimwear.
Well, they' re European.
I' m going to have to ask you to leave.
- It is not a question of money.
- Well, you see...... I' m buying this hotel...... and setting some new rules about the pool area.
I think the Batman deserves a medal.
And a straitjacket to pin it on.
Thank you.
Bruce?
Rachel?
I' d heard you were back.
What are you doing?
Just swimming here.
Wow, it is good to see you.
You were gone a long time.
- I know.
How are things?
- The same.
Job' s getting worse.
Can' t change the world on your own.
What choice do I have...... when you' re too busy swimming?
Rachel, all of -
All this...
It' s - It' s not me.
It' s...
I am more.
Come on.
Bruce, we have some more hotels for you to buy.
Bruce...... deep down you may still be that same great kid you used to be.
But it' s not who you are underneath...... it' s what you do that defines you.
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.
Not at all.
He cut his wrists?
Probably looking for the insanity plea.
But if anything should happen...
Of course, better safe than sorry.
Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can' t take it anymore.
It' s all too much.
Blah, blah, blah.
A couple of days of this food, it' il be true.
- What do you want?
- I wanna know...... how you' re gonna convince me to keep my mouth shut.
About what?
You don' t know anything.
My God.
What on earth have you done?
Again we arrive to Witness the moment of that monster.
I will not tolerate any longer, Markus.
Your brothers must be stopped
It ends tonight!
We must move quickly before they turns
It is still here
Yes.
He mustn' t be harmed
I gave him my word, did I not?
But William must be controlled.
Burn the bodies.
Search the whole building!
Markus! stay with me.
Give me the torch.
They are turning!!
straight to the forest.
I would stayed and fight, you need my help
I need you alive.
If you die, we all die.
Now go!
Go!
- AND?
We need more men.
It finds Amelia.
Amelia... we found William.
Não!
Leave in the in peace!
Equal, estão killing he!
More.
William.
Markus!
He stayed under mine command as we combine,
Which and you are going to learn how is your place.
His pleasantness by this beast is nonsense.
Its irmão is clearly outside of Control.
It will be deed of my skill.
You know the consequences If murder me.
Or William.
It will have chosen the future of him by him.
My mister?
Imprison- him by all the time.
Far from you.
For six centuries, was a Faithful servant to the clã of the vampires.
But I was betrayed.
The war não was what looked.
In a night, the lies that United our class they were displayed.
For it defeat Viktor, our leader.
But the search of Kraven by Be able to and dominação failed.
Viktor não was the savior That I was taught it believe.
He betrayed to the everybody we.
Soon it hunts will go behind his murderer.
Michael.
The human descendant of Corvinus.
A hybrid.
It is alone a questão of time Before of we will uncover.
Angels of the Night:
To Evolução
Ours last ancião survivor.
And expôr the truth.
Before, Kraven tried kill- him While he still hibernava.
Kraven knows that não is Páreo for him woken up.
That thing is dead there are weeks.
I thought that lycans come back To its human form when died.
They come back.
That there received a serum For stop to regressão, and to be studied.
As you know?
SUBSTANCE INJECTED 850ML THASARlNE FOR DELAY TO REGRESSÃO
Não is well its Department, I suppose.
Não I lend A lot atenção after that.
Não a lot.
Those shelters estão connected to the a Central Computer, for that Lucian be able to Know which estão active.
Someone already should have us discovered.
It is lacking around a Hour pra arrive the day.
You are going to come back pra Mansão before of the sun be born?
Necessarily.
Everything well, we are going to catch the That we are necessary and leave.
Não.
I go alone.
Open.
Markus?
They showed me that to their Greed, não knows limits.
I can explain.
By that I would hear its lies?
When the journey up to truth...
it is tão more sweet...
Clears the mess.
It goes stayed before the Viktor
And it say exactly the that I sent word you
Alone concentrate in his part.
I help- him.
You already helped.
If I complete my case, there is a Chance of yourself be able to to be protected.
In that moment you should remain Outside of sight.
I não I can risk.
It sit down and expect for you?
You não goes alone.
You não is tão strong How much is thinking.
The what?
Micahel, you are unique.
Never Existed a hybrid before.
And is going to want blood.
You are necessary be fed.
Without him yourself stayed More and more weak.
It uses his time pra that.
God of the heaven!
And its I não will want?
And itself I não obtain?
Normal sustenance can be a mortal.
If you não be anticipated to the Kraven he is going to attack humans.
And believes, you não want That in its conscience.
Não there is as come back Michael.
I feel very.
It looks, I entendo what did you do.
And I am grateful.
You saved to my life.

Looks... goes!
I go stayed here.
Alone it be assured that is going to come back.

It was silenced?
Of a form without Injure- him, as ordered.
It shows me what do you have.
Yes, mister.
Two officials were dead persons, Não we find bodies of lycans.
Some kind of ultraviolet.
Amelia?
Without signs of life.
But não did nothing for avoid.
And Viktor?
Without sign of Markus, between the ash?
It looks that he destroyed its Own tomb, mister.
Never was the tomb of him.
We are going to go.
Give me a moment.
ACTlVE USER:
There is you.
As you are?
It obliged.
If move away of me!
Light them for there.
Drug!

It takes!
- Não!
- Michael, you are going to die.
Junk!
It obtains be stirred?
We are going to go.
Markus.
I know what did you do, Selene.
Viktor deserved his fate, And Kraven não was better.
Kraven already reaped the reward Of his own errors.
And Viktor...
Many and many times.
That terrible business has The scum of its family.
So much effort was spent for It conceal this matter of me.
You what supõe that Viktor had to the conceal?
Or perhaps... it is you, Selene... as to last of its miserable family...
Goes!
If it imports that I drive?
It enters!
You go What do I give me want.
You are well?
- He is a híbrido, não is?
- It is.
He will want that.
Why?
I não I know.
But we We have another problem.
It turns here.
Junk.
I tidy up that.
It stayed with the foot in the accelerator, But it stayed lowered.
Endures.
It stayed lowered.
Comes.
Give me its mão.
God of the heaven!
Não is necessary even...
I already come back.
Tá good, leaves I see.
Saw?
Não is necessary.
Everything dependable, mister.
Put of the sun.
Which the problem?
And the weapons utilized They were left pra backwards.
Então não may have gone very distant.
Remain on air.
I know that They reappearão with the time.
Yes, mister!
I already saw that before when was an infant.
I held him, and was Open of that skill.
As that is possible?
I não I know.
But I know someone that is able to know.
He is the historian Official in of the tombs.
He stayed discredited by speak what Viktor considered malicious lies.
It is clear, that finished being uncovered, That he be speaking the truth.
What happened with him?
He was exiled there is 300 years behind.
300 years?
What is going to find you That find- him now?
It was I who exiled him.
It looks to be a monastery.
It used to be.
It is more As a prisão now.
Tanis comes being concealed There since the order of Viktor.
We are going to be the first It see him in centuries.
- That is strange.
- THE what?
Não I remember of that Portão be here before.
Catch that.
Junk.
Come back!
It catch you.
Knew that was you, Selene.
The stench of the blood of the Viktor Still traverses its veins.
Tanis.
I saw that its aim não improved.
You não changed.
You não frightens me, Selene.
Well, we are going to have that work in that.
We are going to converse.
That exile looks to be more Comfortable than I remembered me.
As a vampire you Bodyguard lycans?
A present.
Of my more persuasive client.
Lucian.
By that Lucian would go protect you?
Because he be negotiating with him.
Ultraviolet bullets.
There is as much as time is in the business Of it kill its own sort?
I do what is Necessary pra survive.
Mine you sayão stayed easier, in the Day that its precious Viktor betrayed me.
It betray era something that he did very well.
Viktor is dead.
I killed him.
You?
It killed Viktor?
Não, I find that não.
To não be that you have Discovered the truth.
Então his eyes estão Finally open.
It is interesting as the truth, it is until more difficult of It absorb than the lie.
It knows, I tried I stopped him, is clear.
I tried to avoid that he Made a crime tão horrible.
That already was a lot pra endure.
My protest went what It put me here.
It take care with that, dear.
It does a terrible damage.
It opens the sheets when is active.
It is good know.
Viktor put you here by a razão, but I doubts that be By its moral qualities.
What do you know?
Well, I não I know nothing...
Então perhaps I uncover That you não is helpful pra swims.
Markus was behind that.
Why?
Some histories são They based in fact.
And other in the decepção.
As you were caused to the believe.
He already was a human.
The leader of those lands.
Markus.
He is the first one.
To spring.
The first true vampire.
Então the legend is true.
When the last one I sigh value more than silver or gold for Viktor,
Deprive- him of the illness and death...
Immortality.
And in change, Viktor would become its Immortal army help- him.
To the it do the what?
For it defeat the first werewolf.
An infectious and risky race.
It created by the own blood of Markus.
Its irmão twin, William.
At least they evolved.
For that those monsters never went Capable of it take the human form of news.
His legitimate only heir They learned how to channel their rage.
And the appetite of William by Destruição was insatiable.
He was necessary to be held.
They hunted and they destroyed the animals.
And they captured William.
Imprisoned him.
Prisoner of Viktor, for ever.
By that left him live?
I measure.
He was notified of that if Markus went dead person, everybody their relatives They would follow for the pit.
Então, what Viktor thought, it is that the death of William would bring The death of all of the lycans.

And I am the map.

To the around of the neck of its daughter.
- Where could he see.
- AND to another one?
- Where?
Inside he.
Under the meat.
Please, please.
I beg.. please.
Perhaps you be able to be found.
Ask for Lorenz Macaro.
As you know that Tanis Não prepared a trap?
He não has boldness Sufficient pra arm pra me.
You are infringing the law.
Leave of the car slowly for that I can see its mãos.
We are here for see Lorenz Macaro.
Leave of the car slowly.
It shows me its mãos.
It want to see my mãos, is?
You can go.
That is him relative então?
Intimate.
You are Alexander Corvinus.
By any name, I Still I am his ancestor.
As you stayed hidden All of those years?
And with the humanity.
Não was the bequest by which I prayed in the manhã in that they They entered in this world.
Concealing the history Unfortunate of my family.
- You não would be able to pair her?
- It is!
- You would kill your own sons?
- You know what Markus is going to do.
If he find me, he It finds to prisão of William.
You are necessary help us to the stop him.
You are me asking for It help to kill my son?
You?
A dealer of the death?
How many innocent you killed in the crossed Of 6 centuries of a family of angels.
It saves me of its Declarações moralistic.
And neither even unlike William.
At least he não obtains It control its selvageria.
Everything that I did is able to It to be put to his feet.
Hundreds of thousands died they must their inabilidade in accept That his sons são monsters.
You Be able to have standstill everything that.
Because you are more tuxedo That his ancestors.
You know to devastação that William It caused before of to be captured.

Piety that palpitates inside a fool.

We are rarities Of the nature, you and I.
Nothing more!
This is a world for humanity.
And that feeling of penalty explains By that you rejected your sons?
While William suffered alone in the escuridão?
Não, father.
I não I have respect for His feeling of penalty.
The key of Viktor.
Where is?
Any plan that you Have pra William is futile.
You não is going to control your irmão!
I am more strong now.
And our borders são bigger Than you never dreamt.
You are wrong.
Soon you are going to be surrounded of Lycans, as well as was before.
But não lycans, father.
All of vampires.
They created to the image of their creator.

Michael.
It put an end he!
It loosens us!
We are going to fall!
William!
I knew that Viktor had made a Error upon staying with you as mascot.
He should have you killed With the remainder of its family.
An unknown chapter Is to our front.
The lines that divide the Clãs, now estão blurry.
Chaos, and fights são inevitable.
To only certainty is that to Escuridão still is to the front.
I eye for the light With a new hope.
And the Lord said unto Moses, ’’ Go.
Return into Egypt. ’’
And Moses took his wife and his son and he returned to the land of Egypt.
And Moses took the rod of God in his hand. ’
Let the ambassador from Priam, king of Troy, approach the Pharaoh.
Great Pharaoh, the gift of Troy is a fabulous fabric from the land of the five rivers.
Our thanks to Priam.
- How is it made?
No one knows.
It is spun on the looms of the gods.
They call it silk.
The ambassador from Jericho.
What kingdom has sent you?
The kingdom of the Most High.
- We bring you the word of God.
What is this word?
Thus sayeth the Lord God of lsrael, ’’ Let my people go! ’’
The slaves are mine.
Their lives are mine.
All that they own is mine.
I do not know your God, nor will I let lsrael go.
Who are you to make their lives bitter in bondage?
Men shall be ruled by law, not the will of other men.
Who is this God that I should let your people go?
Aaron.
Cast down my staff before Pharaoh that he may see the power of God.
ln this you shall know that the Lord is God.
Mother!
He turned his staff into a cobra!
Nothing of HlS will harm you, my son.
The power of your God is a cheap magician’ s trick.
Jannes.
Mother, look!
Jannes, do you see?
Moses ’ serpent swallows up the others.
You gave me this staff to rule over scorpions and serpents, but God made it a rod to rule over kings.
Hear his word, Rameses, and obey.
Obey?
Are there no magicians in Egypt that you have come back to make serpents out of sticks?
Or cause rabbits to appear?
I will give your staff a greater wonder to perform.
- Let his staff provide them.
Or let them glean straw for themselves.
But their tally of bricks shall not diminish.
So let it be written.
So let it be done.
(Man) Aaron.
Aaron, when do we leave Egypt?
We do not leave Egypt.
But Moses promised us.
But you said we’ d be freed!
I have brought more evil upon you.
God forgive my weak use of his strength.
(Man) Moses, what have you done to us?
It is Pharaoh ’ s order that you be given no straw to make your tally of bricks.
No straw?
How can we make bricks without straw?
You will glean the fields by night.
Your women and children, too.
ls this the deliverer?
You’ ve brought the wrath of Pharaoh upon us!
You put a sword in their hands!
Stone him!
Stone him!
Stand aside!
Come!
Follow!
There goes your deliverer.
Now go find your straw.
Remember the tally must be the same.
Not one brick less.
I cursed you.
Each time Rameses took me in his arms I cursed you, not him, because I love you.
The Moses who loved you was another man.
No, he was not.
You believe you’ ve changed, but you haven’ t.
You call yourself a prophet, a man of God, but I know better.
I don’ t believe only the thunder of a mountain stirs your heart, as you stir mine.
Nefretiri, I have stood in the burning light of God’ s own presence.
It was not he who saved you just now.
I did that.
Why, of all men, did I fall in love with the prince of fools?
But I believe anything you tell me when l’ m in your arms.
Why must you deny me and yourself?
Because I am bound to a God and to a people and to a shepherd girl.
A shepherd girl?
What can she be to you?
Unless the desert sun has dulled your senses.
Does she... grate garlic on her skin?
Or is it soft as mine?
Are her lips chafed and dry as the desert sand?
Or are they moist and red like a pomegranate?
ls it the fragrance of myrrh that scents her hair?
Or is it the odour of sheep?
There is a beauty beyond the senses, Nefretiri.
Beauty like the quiet of green valleys and still waters.
Beauty whose spirit you cannot understand.
Perhaps not.
But beauty of the spirit will not free your people, Moses.
YOU will come to me or THEY will never leave Egypt.
The fate of lsrael is not in your hands, Nefretiri.
Oh, isn’ t it?
Who else can soften Pharaoh ’ s heart?
Or harden it?
Yes.
You may be the lovely dust through which God will work his purpose.
Fill every jar with water.
For seven days there will be none to drink.
- But this well has never run dry.
- One who knows.
- Yes, l’ m going back for more jars.
Yes, Joshua.
She comes to the well every day.
Wait and you will see her.
It is wise of Dathan to send you to the well, Lilia, or he might find his water poisoned.
They told me you were dead.
To all I love, Joshua, I am dead.
- Yes.
Dathan.
Of your own free will?
Of my own free will.
You are no man’ s slave.
The hour of deliverance has come.
Not for me, Joshua.
Hail to thee, great god of the Nile!
Thy waters are the blood of Egypt.
Hail to thee, maker of barley, feeder of cattle, carrier of ships, greatest of all the gods.
Pharaoh of Egypt!
You have not yet obeyed the Lord.
Let my people go!
The point of the sword...
Let him rave that men shall know him mad.
Obey the Lord or he will raise his hand against the waters of the river.
I have come to bless the waters, you have come to curse them.
We will learn if a shepherd god is stronger than the gods of Pharaoh.
Water of life, give drink to the desert and make green the meadow.
Aaron.
Stretch out my staff against the waters.
Look!
Where he’ s touched the river, it bleeds.
The water turns to blood!
Blood flows from the god!
See how it spreads.
It lS blood!
That you may know the power of the Lord, for seven days, Egypt will thirst.
- Pestilence will be everywhere!
Were it seven times seven days, no magician’ s trick will set your people free.
Sacred water, make pure the flood from which you came.
’ And God smote the land with all manner of plagues, ’ but still Pharaoh ’ s heart was hardened. ’
Great one, you hear the cry of Egypt.
They would cry louder if THEY had to make the bricks.
Send them away.
The people have been plagued by thirst, by frogs, by lice, by flies.
They can endure no more.
Why do you bring this worker of evil before me?
The people desert the temples and turn from the gods.
What gods?
You prophets and priests MADE the gods, that you may prey upon the fears of men.
When the Nile ran red, I too was afraid... until word came of a mountain beyond the cataracts which spewed red mud and poisoned the water.
Was it the staff that caused this?
Was it the wonder of your god that fish died and frogs left the water?
Was it a miracle that flies and lice should bloat upon their carrion and spread disease?
These things were ordered by themselves, not by any god!
Now go.
That you may know these things are done of God...
you shall see hail fall from a clear sky and burn as fire upon the ground.
You shall see darkness cover Egypt when the sun climbs high to noon.
And you shall know that God is God and bow down to his will.
Nothing of this Earth can make me bow to you, Moses.
Behold, the hail comes.
When darkness has covered Egypt for three days, your ministers will send for me.
ln the three days of darkness, you have whined like frightened children in the night.
Moses said the sun would shine in three days and it is true.
Let his people go, or Egypt will be barren from the cataracts to the sea.
Will my father free the slaves?
Can taxes be collected from blighted harvests?
Does fear rule Egypt... or do l?
We fear no army of the Earth, but can we fight plagues with swords?
There is no shame in this.
It is not Pharaoh who yields to the slave, but his counsellors.
I have summoned Moses at your request.
(Counsellor) People will bless you, great one.
Does the world bow to an empty throne?
Empty?
Does a Pharaoh harden his heart against his son?
lf you let the Hebrews go, who will build HlS cities?
You told Moses to make bricks without straw.
Now HE tells YOU to make cities without bricks!
Who is the slave... and who is the Pharaoh?
Do you hear laughter, Rameses?
Yes, the laughter of kings in Babylon, in Canaan, in Troy... as Egypt surrenders to the god of slaves!
Bring the Hebrew in.
Go into the garden.
lt’ s not good for a son of Pharaoh to see his father humbled by a son of slaves.
My son, stand beside me.
Have the days of darkness made you see the light, Rameses?
Will you now free my people?
Great one, bid the scribe read the order.
Give me the writing.
You cannot resist the power of his god!
I know not his god!
Neither will I let his people go.
How long will you refuse to humble yourself before God?
lf you bring another plague upon us, it is not your god but I who will turn the Nile red with blood.
As your father’ s father did with the blood of our male children!
lf there is one more plague on Egypt, it is by YOUR word that God will bring it.
And there shall be so great a cry throughout the land that you will surely let the people go.
Come to me no more, Moses, for on the day you see my face again, you will surely die.
So let it be written.
I will give this spawn of slaves and his god an answer the world will not forget!
Commander of the Host, call on the chariots from Talis.
There SHALL be one more plague... only it will come upon the slaves of Goshen!
First- born of each house shall die, beginning with the son of Moses.
You are the shepherd girl that Moses married?
The queen of Egypt lS beautiful... as he told me.
My husband is not here.
ls this Moses ’ son?
Yes, this is our son.
What do you want of us?
You need have no fear of me.
I feared only his memory of you.
You have been able to erase it?
He has forgotten both of us.
You lost him when he went to seek his god.
I lost him when he found his god.
At least he left you a son to cherish.
I am here to save his son.
From what?
From Pharaoh ’ s decree that the first- born of lsrael must die.
Die?
God of Abraham!
Don’ t let him do this!
Not to the children!
A caravan for Midian awaits you and your son.
My chariot will take you to it.
l’ m surprised you noticed me.
You didn’ t at the palace this morning.
Why?
Were you afraid to look at me?
What do you want, Nefretiri?
You, Moses.
Everything about us is coming to an end!
You will destroy Egypt or Egypt will destroy you.
I belong to you, Moses.
She’ s gone with your son to Midian.
Why did she leave?
She knew you’ d try to save the other children before your own son.
From what?
Rameses is massing the Libyan axemen, the chariots, Sardinian swordsmen.
Why?
Tell me why!
To destroy the first- born of lsrael.
Oh, God!
My God!
Out of his own mouth comes thy judgement!
But I have saved your son!
It is not my son who will die!
It is the first- born of Egypt!
YOUR son, Nefretiri!
You would not dare strike Pharaoh ’ s son!
ln the hardness of his heart, Pharaoh brings death to his own son!
But he’ s MY son, Moses.
You would not harm MY son?
I, myself, am nothing.
God’ s power uses me to work his will.
You would not let him do this to me.
I saved YOUR son.
I cannot save yours.
Your god listens to you, Moses.
About midnight, the destroyer will come into the midst of Egypt and all the first- born shall die, from the first- born of Pharaoh to the first- born of his servants.
When you were Prince of Egypt, you held me in your arms.
I threw myself at your feet before the court of Pharaoh.
Because I loved you, Moses.
It is the Lord who executes judgement, Nefretiri.
Go back to your son.
Your love for me is stronger than the power of any god.
You will not kill my son.
Turn from thy fierce wrath, O Lord!
# Death cometh to me
# To set me free
# Death cometh to me... #
No, Lilia, death will not come to you.
Joshua, you risk your life in coming here.
- You are first- born.
- So are you.
I bring lamb’ s blood to mark the doorposts and lintel... that the Angel of Death may pass you by.
Joshua, it is enough that you have come to me.
I am outcast among our people.
Don’ t save me from death, Joshua, save me from life.
Tomorrow will bring a new world.
No!
And no blood on this door!
Dathan, it will save her life!
Moses has God’ s promise!
Moses has words, Pharaoh has spears.
Remember, Joshua, of her own free will she’ s mine.
# And under his wing shalt thou trust # ’’ Though we stand in the shadow of death, ’’ the Lord is our God.
The Lord is one. ’’ (All) ’’ The Lord is one. ’’
# His truth shall be thy shield... # ’’ Shield us through this night of terror, O King of the Universe. ’’ (Woman screams)
Why is this night different from all others?
# Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night # (Knock at door)
Pharaoh ’ s soldiers!
Or worse!
# Or from the arrow that flyeth by day #
Bithiah!
ln fear of your god they have set me free.
May a stranger enter?
There are no strangers among those who seek God’ s mercy.
My bearers?
All who thirst for freedom may come with us.
The darkness of death will pass over us tonight.
Tomorrow the light of freedom will shine upon us as we go forth from Egypt.
- From the house of Pharaoh!
An idol- worshipper!
This woman drew me from the Nile and set my feet upon the path of knowledge.
Mered, bring a chair for Pharaoh ’ s daughter.
There is a great light shines from your face.
Perhaps some day I shall understand it.
He is God’ s messenger, Princess.
lf it is not forbidden to look upon the breath of pestilence, then see, for it is here.
Do not look, Eleazar.
Close the door, Joshua, and let death pass.
Will it pass, Moses?
Will it pass?
That is God’ s promise, Elisheba.
’’ Blessed art thou, o Lord our God ’’ Who bringeth forth bread from the earth. ’’ (Distant shouting)
Run!
# A thousand shall fall at thy sight #
Why do we eat unleavened bread and bitter herbs?
(Hoofbeats outside) (Man) Faster!
Take the other road!
The herbs remind us of the bitterness of captivity, Eleazar.
This is the bread of haste, that you will remember this night from generation to generation forever.
- All are God’ s people.
Death is all around us!
But it passes those who have believed the Lord.
Always remember, Eleazar... he passed over your house.
- Some devil’ s curse!
Look!
l’ ve known battle for 30 years, Pharaoh, but never fear till tonight.
Aide.
Have the captains join their men.
At the coming of dawn we will strike.
No first- born Hebrew shall live.
Let the Hebrews go, great one, or we are all dead men.
He was your son?
My first- born.
There is no magic cure, no spell to use.
He is the first- born of Pharaoh.
We have no skill before this... pestilence.
My father.
My son.
- From Moses.
I would not let his people go because your serpent’ s tongue hardened my heart.
You only thought to keep Moses here.
You cared nothing for my throne... or my son.
I asked Moses for his life.
The shadow of death is on his face.
He will not die.
Captain.
Take my fastest chariot.
Bring Moses to me.
I will bring him, mighty Pharaoh.
He’ s my only son.
You have conquered, Moses.
The foot of a slave is on the neck of Egypt.
You were saved from the Nile to be a curse upon me.
Your shadow fell between me and my father, between me and my fame, between me and my queen.
Your shadow now fills all things with death.
Go out from among us, you and your people.
I set you free.
It is not by your word, nor by my hand that we are free, Pharaoh.
The power of God has freed us.
Enough of your words!
Take your people, your cattle, your god and your pestilence.
But go!
O Lord God... with a strong hand thou dost bring us out of bitter bondage.
For every man shall reap what he has sown and bow no knee except in prayer.
We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters...
With our flocks and with our herds will we go, for I know that the Lord is great and that our Lord is above all gods.
He’ s dead.
Soca, great lord of the lower world...
I, who have denied the gods of Egypt, bow before you now.
Show that you have power above the god of Moses, and restore the life he has taken from my son.
Guide back his soul across the lake of death to the place of living men, and I will raise a temple to you mightier than the pyramids.
Hear me, dread lord of darkness...
Arise, O lsrael!
Behold the dawn of freedom!
’ And it came to pass, after the stifling night of terror, ’ came a day such as the world had never seen. ’ From east and west, from north and south, ’ they came with all they had, driving their flocks ’ and their herds and their camels before them. ’ By tens, by hundreds, by thousands, ’ unending streams of man and beast and burden, ’ and even very much cattle, ’ poured into the Avenue of Sphinxes. ’ Beneath the stone feet of the four colossal images of Rameses, ’ which their own sweat and blood and sinew ’ had hewn from solid rock, ’ a nation arose and freedom was born into the world. ’
(Child) Father, have you got Rebekka?
No, I haven’ t got Rebekka.
Here’ s the trough.
Sling it on your shoulders.
- Thank you!
Rachel, help me with this brick yoke.
Don’ t forget the oil for the baths!
Where are we going?
To some land flowing with milk and honey!
l’ ve never tasted honey.
Anybody know the way?
lt’ s away from the whip!
Freedom will wet your throats in the desert.
This is the governor’ s house!
You cannot enter.
Out!
All of you!
Why do soldiers come here?
I put no blood on my door.
Then stone bleeds!
Your stonecutter did this to me!
All your gold cannot wipe that mark from your door... or from my heart.
For that, you’ il walk all the way to...
Where are we going?
Do you know where we’ re going?
To hell, I hope!
’ Like Dathan, they did not know where they were going, ’ and cared no more than their flocks. ’ Now they used the brick yokes for a very different burden. ’ There went forth among them ’ planters of vineyards and sowers of seeds, ’ each hoping to sit under his own vine and fig tree. ’ Out of this glorious chaos, ’ it is Joshua who brings order and purpose. ’
Set the standard of each tribe before the people!
Levite in the centre, Judah to the right, Hephron left.
(Woman) Watch where you’ re going!
Watch out for my geese!
Aaron and the elders are carrying a shrouded body, Grandfather!
They are the bones of Joseph, to rest in his own land.
Nubians, Grandfather!
- Spoils of Egypt.
Here, boy!
For the blind one!
A little golden calf, Grandfather, with horns!
An idol.
For idol- worshippers!
There are the fire- bearers!
Plant your fires at night beside the standards, that all may light their torches!
Eleazar, hang this on the wagon.
Now the cradle...
I have wagons for midwives and physicians.
Place them at 5, 000 cubits...
l’ il pay you back every lash you gave me, Dathan!
- ls this a day for hard feelings?
- l’ ve felt your whip!
Lilia is no slave, Dathan!
You can carry your own carton.
(Others laugh)
So, now, my brother, we have NEW task- masters.
We serve no masters now!
- Here.
Old woman.
- Joshua!
Make way for the governor!
- I know who you WERE.
Go and tell Rameses l’ m coming back to my house.
That rabble may follow Moses into the desert today, but when their eyes are seared red by the sun and their cracked lips bleed with thirst, when their stomachs cramp with hunger, they will curse the name of Moses and his god.
Then I will lead them back to Pharaoh and the brick pits.
There are so many.
So many.
How shall I find thy road through the wilderness, Lord?
How shall I find water in the desert for this multitude?
Moses... the people are assembled.
Then let us go forth to the mountain of God, that he may write his commandments in our minds and hearts forever.
We march, praising his mighty name!
- Let the trumpets sound!
Hear, O lsrael!
Remember this day, when the strong hand of the Lord leads you out of bondage!
(All) The Lord is our God!
The Lord is one!
The Lord is our God!
The Lord is one!
- Yes!
Joshua!
400 years in bondage and TODAY he won’ t move!
# The Lord is one!
# Thank thee, O Lord... #
My litter can carry him.
- Children shall eat of its fruit!
Do you hear that?
You have a strong new son!
’ And he brought forth the people with joy and gladness. ’ He bore them out of Egypt ’ as an eagle bears its young upon its wings. ’ But again...
Pharaoh ’ s heart was hardened. ’
How many more days and nights will you pray?
Does he hear you?
Dread Lord of Darkness, are you not greater than the god of Moses?
- He cannot hear you.
He’ s nothing but a piece of stone with the head of a bird.
He WlLL hear me.
I am Egypt.
Egypt?
You are nothing.
You let Moses kill my son.
No god can bring him back.
What have you done to Moses?
How did he die?
Did he cry for mercy when you tortured him?
Bring me to his body!
I want to see it!
This is my son.
He would have been Pharaoh.
He would have ruled the world.
Who mourns him now?
Not even you.
All you can think of is Moses.
I drove him out of Egypt.
I cannot fight the power of his god.
HlS god?
The priests say that Pharaoh is a god, but you are not a god, you are even less than a man.
Listen to me, Rameses, you thought I was evil when I went to Moses, and you were right.
Shall I tell you what happened, Rameses?
He spurned me, like a strumpet in the street.
I, Nefretiri, Queen of Egypt!
All that you wanted from me he would not even take.
Do you hear laughter, Pharaoh?
Not the laughter of kings, but the laughter of slaves on the desert!
Laughter?
Laughter?
My son, I shall build your tomb upon their crushed bodies!
lf any escape, their seed shall be scattered and accursed forever!
My armour.
War crown.
Laughter?
I will turn the laughter of these slaves into wails of torment!
They SHALL remember the name of Moses, only that he died under my chariot wheels!
Kill him with your own hands.
Let the trumpet sound.
Alert the watch towers.
Assemble all the chariots at the city gate.
I obey!
Ready my chariot.
I will bring you back your temple treasure!
Bring it back to me stained with his blood.
I will!
To mingle with your own!
(Commander) Salute!
(All) Hail!
(All) Hail!
Remember your first- born!
- (All) Death to the slaves!
- Death to their god!
Hail!
Forward!
Over the sea?
No, it comes from the desert.
That’ s the thunder of horses!
Look!
Pharaoh ’ s chariot!
We’ re trapped against the sea!
Caleb, warn the north tents!
Joshua?
That’ s Joshua’ s horn!
All men to the pass!
Get horses, wagons!
Form a barrier!
What’ s the alarm?
Pharaoh ’ s chariot!
Block the pass with carts!
Women and children, to the sea!
Mallets!
Hear me!
Can mallets stop arrows?
Will your cart stop Pharaoh ’ s chariots?
Women, do you want your men killed?
Moses!
Pharaoh ’ s chariots!
- Order the men to move back, Joshua.
Move back?
Where? lnto the sea?
lnto the hand of God.
Deliverer?
He’ s delivered you to death!
Look!
Blame Moses for this!
Deliver him to Pharaoh!
(All) Yes!
Stone him!
The god of Moses is a poor general... to leave him no retreat.
Ten times you have seen the miracles of the Lord!
And still you have no faith!
He delivers you to death!
Stone him!
Stone him!
Listen to Moses!
He speaks God’ s will!
- A chariot knows no rank.
Was it because there where no graves in Egypt that you took us to die in the wilderness?
Fear not!
Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord!
- The work of God!
Through it!
No, great one!
You cannot breach the fire of God!
Gather your families and flocks.
We must go with all speed.
Go where?
To drown in the sea?
How long can the fire hold?
After this day you shall see his chariots no more!
No!
You’ il be dead under them!
The Lord of Hosts will do battle for us!
Behold his mighty hand!
The wind opens the sea!
God opens the sea with the blast of his nostrils!
- His will be done!
He opens the waters for them and he bars our way with fire.
Let us go.
Men cannot fight a god!
Better to die in battle with a god, than live in shame.
Praise God and down into it!
God has delivered us!
- Never mind the wheel!
Pull for your lives!
ls your life worth so much?
Save the bread if you can!
Bring Caleb to help with the wagons!
Moses!
Stand on the rock where the people can see you and have hope!
Above us!
The fire dies!
Sound the pursuit!
Chariots, halt!
This is work for a butcher, not a Pharaoh.
Destroy them all.
But bring Moses to me alive.
Level spears!
Forward!
- Here!
Wait!
Grandfather, look, the horses are coming!
The chariots!
Run!
Run!
Better to serve than to die here!
Who shall withstand the power of God?
Thou didst blow with thy winds and the sea covered them!
Who is like unto Thee, O Lord?
From everlasting to everlasting... Thou art God!
(All) The Lord is one!
The Lord is one!
Before you strike... show me his blood on your sword.
You couldn’ t even kill him.
His god... lS God.
’ And Moses led lsrael from the Red Sea ’ into the wilderness of Sinai. ’ And they camped before the holy mountain. ’ And when the people saw ’ that Moses delayed to come down out of the mountain, ’ they gathered together. ’
By the will of God!
Do you?
Or you, Sephora?
His grieving wife.
She came back to find her husband.
But even she cannot hope he lives!
Moses went up into the forbidden ground to receive God’ s law!
But he’ s not returned!
We share your pain.
We sympathise.
But will sympathy lead us to this land flowing with milk and honey?
(Man) Now we have no leader!
Moses WlLL return... AAH!
let Moses die before his work is done?
His mother!
So beautiful is the hope of a mother!
But there are other mothers among you!
What will become of your children?
- Faith in what?
You, Aaron?
- Across the wilderness!
- No!
- Not with a god of Egypt before us!
- Make one, Aaron.
- Aaron knows the art of the temple!
(Others implore)
He will not!
He would rather see our flesh rot in the wilderness.
You WlLL make a god for us!
A god of gold!
A golden calf!
Korah shall be the high priest!
Bring baskets!
Buckets!
Shawls!
Anything you have!
Take off your earrings, your bracelets, your necklaces...
- There!
From the burning bush, O Lord, you charged me to bring the people to this holy mountain, to behold your glory and receive your law.
What have I left undone?
’ l am... ’ l am... ’ l am the Lord thy God. ’ Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
’ Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.
’ And they overlaid the image with pure gold. ’ And Aaron fashioned it and smoothed it with the hammer, ’ ready to be graven by cunning art and man’ s device. ’ And he fastened it with nails that it should not move. ’ And he that smote the anvil ’ did beat the molten gold into thin plates. ’ For they had gathered their treasure into the midst of the furnace, ’ and did blow the fire upon it to melt it. ’ And they adorned themselves in rich apparel and costly array, ’ veils of blue, purple and scarlet, and fine linen wrought in Egypt. ’ And the women tread grapes into new wine. ’ ’ Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.
’ Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
’ Honour thy father and thy mother.
’ Thou shalt not kill. ’
(Cheering) ’ And the people sinned a great sin, ’ for they had made them a god of gold. ’ And they bore him upon their shoulders and rejoiced, ’ saying, ’’ This be our god, O lsrael. ’’’
Are you mourners of Moses afraid to face the new god? ’ Then they were as children who have lost their faith. ’ They were perverse and crooked and rebellious against God.
They did eat the bread of wickedness, ’ and drank the wine of violence, ’ and did evil in the eyes of the Lord. ’ And the people cried, ’’’ The graven image hath brought us joy, ’’ ’ and they worshipped the golden calf and sacrificed unto it. ’
Here is your sacrifice!
’ Thou shalt not commit adultery.
’ Thou shalt not steal.
’ Thou shalt not covet anything that is thy neighbour’ s. ’
(Moses) Written with the finger of God.
Get thee down, ’ for thy people have corrupted themselves. ’
’ And the people rose up to play and did eat and drink. ’ They were as the children of fools ’ and cast off their clothes. ’ The wicked were like a troubled sea ’ whose waters cast up mire and dirt. ’ They sank from evil to evil and were viler than the earth. ’ And there was rioting and drunkenness, ’ for they had become servants of sin. ’ There was manifest all manner of ungodliness and works of the flesh. ’ Even adultery and lasciviousness, ’ uncleanness, idolatry and rioting, ’ vanity and wrath. ’ And they were filled with iniquity and vile affections. ’ And Aaron knew that he had brought them to shame. ’
Abiram!
Korah!
Bind the sacrifice with cord!
Even unto the horns of the altar!
The light of God shines from you, Moses.
Do not kneel to me, Joshua.
These tablets of stone...
The writing of God.
His Ten Commandments.
There is a noise of war in the camp.
It is not the noise of war.
It is the noise of song and revelry.
Moses!
Joshua!
Woe unto thee, oh lsrael.
You have sinned a great sin in the sight of God!
You are not worthy to receive these Ten Commandments.
Aaron!
We are gathered against you, Moses!
You take too much upon yourself!
We will not live by your commandments.
We are free!
There is no freedom without the law.
Whose law?
Yours?
Did you carve the tablets to become a prince over us?
let him come to me!
(Confused shouts)
- These people made me.
He showed you no milk and honey!
I show you a god of gold!
Come with me!
Follow me!
Blasphemers! ldolaters!
For this you shall drink bitter waters!
God has set before you this day his laws of life and good and death and evil.
Those who will not live by the law... (Shouts of panic) shall die by the law!
’ And the Lord’ s anger was kindled against lsrael. ’ And to prove whether they would keep his commandments or no, ’ he made them wander in the wilderness 40 years, ’ until the generation that had done evil in the sight of the Lord ’ was consumed. ’ But Moses ’ eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. ’ And he went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountains, ’ and the Lord showed him all the land ’ that was beyond the river Jordan. ’
The Lord was angry with me because I disobeyed him by the waters of strife.
And he said unto me, ’’ Behold the new land with thine eyes. ’’ Thou shalt not cross over this river Jordan. ’’
Then I shall stay.
I go alone.
Look, Moses.
The people have come to the river Jordan.
ln the Ark they carry the law you brought them.
You taught them not to live by bread alone.
You are God’ s torch, that lights the way to freedom.
I love you.
Joshua, I charge you and strengthen you, for you shall go over Jordan to lead the people.
As for me and my house, we shall serve the Lord.
Mered, give me the books.
Eleazar... set these five books in the Ark of the Covenant, by the tablets of the Ten Commandments, which the Lord restored unto us.
Go.
Proclaim liberty throughout all the lands, unto all the inhabitants thereof.
(Woman) Hey, Rose.
Hey, Dorothy.
I' m gonna go over there.
We' re waitin '.
Alvin.
Alvin Straight!
Rose left a couple of hours ago.
Did you hear me hollerin 'for Rose?
I wasn' t lookin 'for Rose.
- I haven' t seen Alvin today.
- Did I ask?
Straight, you' re late!
Alvin!
Alvin!
Alvin!
- Come in, Bud.
- What the... Alvin?!
Where the hell are you?
I can' t see a thing.
Over here, Bud.
Watch your step.
What the hell' s going on?
What are you doin 'layin' on the floor?
You nuts?
Supposed to be down at Davmar' s one hour ago.
What' s going on?
Oh, my God!
(Alvin) Hey, Dorothy.
What' s the number for 911?
- No, Dorothy.
- What you doin '?
I' il call the bar and tell 'em we' re not comin'.
Are you crazy?
We have a stricken man here.
Are you stricken, Alvin?
Put the phone down!
Dad, what' s all the yellin '?
Wh- what... uh, have you done to my dad?
Oh, for cry eye!
Dad?
Are you OK, Dad?
I just need a little help gettin 'up, honey.

I' il be right back.
OK, Bud.
I' m not goin '.
Dad.
I' m not goin '.
You promised me, Dad.
OK, Mr Straight, put this robe on.
Just bring me the doctor.
(Rose stammers) You like birds.
I build... uh, birdhouses... uh, for bluebirds.
Yeah, it' s Pete... uh, Pete sells my... uh, birdhouses... at the Ace Hardware.
- I' il look for them next time.
- Yeah?
No operation.
This morning you fall and can' t get up, that' s your hips, Alvin.
And you' il need a walker now.
No walker.
Fine, a second cane, then.
You say you' re having trouble seeing.
That could be a diabetes- related problem.
I' d like to run some tests.
No tests and no X- rays.
Well, I see and hear that you smoke.
My guess is you' re in the early stages of emphysema.
And Alvin, you have circulation problems and I' m worried about your diet.
If you don' t make some changes quickly, there will be some serious consequences.
It... has a... a red roof.
Another pretty one, Rose.
I want to... uh, paint the... uh, next one blue.
That' s a good idea.
What... uh, did the doctor say?
He said I was gonna live to be 100.
I think I' il go and mow the lawn.
Uh, I can... uh, cut it for you, Dad.
I got it, sweetheart.
God darn!
No, we' il... we won' t be mowin 'today.
Storm' s comin 'in.
Yeah.
I love a lightnin 'storm.
Uh, me too, Dad.
(Rose) Hello?
This is... is Rose.
Yeah...
Uh- huh.
Oh, no...
When?
OK... right... right...
I' il tell him.
Yeah...
OK...
Bye.
Uh, that was... Bobby.
Uncle Lyle... had a..... a stroke.
Dad?
No, Bobby, he... he didn' t say much.
Uh, they' ve both... uh, been so... uh, stubborn.
No, no, it was longer, I remember.
It was... uh, July, uh, 7th, 19... 88, uh, Bobby.
I always... remember the dates.
Yeah.
I don' t know... uh, what he' il do.
(Alvin) Rose, darlin '?
Rose?
I' m gonna go back on the road.
I' ve gotta go see Lyle.
But, Dad...
How are you...?
Well, I... haven' t quite got that figured yet.
One, your eyes are bad.
That' s why you don' t... uh, drive your car.
Uh, two, Uncle Lyle... uh, lives in... uh, Wisconsin, which is... uh, 317 miles away.
You would have to... uh, stay all night... in Des Moines.
Then there' s no... uh, bus... to Zion.
Three, your... uh, hips are bad.
You can hardly... uh, stand... for two minutes...
And when you... uh, do stand up... this... is the sound you make... when you... stand.
Uh, four, uh, you are... uh, 73 years old...
You were... uh, born when, uh, Calvin... uh, Coolidge was president... of America.
Uh, you are... uh, 73 years old, Dad.
And... I cannot drive you there.
Rose, darlin ', I' m not dead yet.
Uh, what are we... uh, building, Dad?
Havin 'a party?
Oh, jeez,...
I love... uh, parties.
Oh, me too.
And so... where' s it at?
Where' s what at?
Your... uh, party.
I' m not havin 'a party.
I thought YOU were havin 'a party.
I am?
Well, yeah.
Look at all that Braunschweiger.
Oh, yeah, it' s a lot of Braunschweiger.
It' s... uh, for my dad, uh, for his... his trip.
Uh, my dad... he' s going to... uh, Wisconsin.
I... asked him how he' s... uh, going to get there...
Uh... but he... uh, won' t say nothing.
Wisconsin?
That is a real party state.
Yeah.
I... uh, hate... uh, Braun... uh... schweiger.
Yeah.
Alvin, you' ve got three five- gallon cans there.
15 gallons of gas.
What do you need so much gas for, Alvin?
Sig, you' re one nosey son of a gun.
(Man sniggers) You got that right.
- I wanna buy that.
- What?
The grabber.
Oh, jeez, Alvin.
- That' s MY grabber, Alvin.
- Well?
Oh, jeez, Alvin.
I don' t...
I... I do have two of them...
I think five dollars is right.
That' s a darn good grabber, Alvin.
- I... I...
- Well?
They' re hard to come by, Alvin.
It' s gonna take me two months to get another one on order.
Jeez, Alvin, ten dollars.
Ring her up.
What do you need that grabber for, Alvin?
Grabbin '.
Oh, jeez, Dad.
Oh, jeez, Dad.
Listen to that old grain elevator.
It' s... uh, harvest time.
Uh, that... uh, trailer is too h- heavy for... for that.
It' s a lawn mower.
You' re going to..... drive a... a lawn mower to another state?
Rosie, I' ve...
I' ve gotta go see Lyle.
And I... I' ve gotta make this trip on my own.
I know you understand.
I guess so.
Look up at the sky, Rosie.
The sky is sure full of stars tonight.
Crimenetto, it' s Alvin and he' s driving his lawn mower.
Alvin!
What are you settin 'out to do here?
For cry eye, Alvin!
Alvin, you' re gonna get blown right off the road, that' s what I' m afraid!
He' il never make it past The Grotto.
I' m havin 'a little engine trouble.
What the heck is that you' re driving there?
It' s a Rehds.
Could you give me a lift into town?
Yeah, to The Grotto.
This is the Sun Ray Tour.
Get in.
- I' il get you help there.
- I' d appreciate that.
My Edward loved his riding mower.
Hey, come here, hurry.
Hurry up.
Poor Alvin.
So the man... in a... pick- up, he brought my dad back.
Ohh... mm, I must' ve been at the beauty shop.
What kinda pick- up?
A Ford.
But what' s your dad doin 'with that gun?
I don' t know.
I gave you that old Rehds last time, right?
That you did.
- You tradin 'in that Rehds now?
- No, I don' t believe I will.
Pete told me you used that rider in a real interestin 'way.
- You still plannin 'to do that?
- Yeah, Tom.
I know not to talk you out of somethin 'you set your mind to, but Alvin, you' ve always struck me as smart.
Well, that' s appreciated.
Until now.
(Alvin) What year?
(Salesman) '66.
Kohler engine.
We' ve used it for parts but I always replace them.
The guts are good.
It' s got the old transmission.
Nothing fancy.
- Is it a good machine?
- It' s good.
Tom, I got $325.
That' s a fact.
Sounds good to me, Alvin.
Let' s go settle up with Alice.
One more thing, sometime you can find out about these old machines, if you know who run 'em.
- Do you know who owned it?
Me.
All right.
I couldn' t get a ride.
Are you hungry?
Whaddaya got?
Weeners.
Weeners?
Weeners.
Wanna try one?
Here' s a good stick for you.
What a hunk ofjunk.
Eat your dinner, missy.
So,... how long you been out on the road?
Well, I been travellin 'most of my life.
Where you from?
Laurens.
Got a wife back there?
Kids?
My wife, Francis delivered 14 babies.
Seven of 'em made it.
My daughter, Rose lives with me.
Francis died in '81.
Where' s your family?
Are you runnin 'away?
How far along are ya?
Five months.
Well, I' m headin 'to see my brother Lyle.
Huh?
I said I' m goin 'to see my brother Lyle in Mount Zion.
- Where' s that?
- Wisconsin.
- Oh...
- Just across the state line.
Cheddar Heads.
Aren' t those the dumbest things you ever seen somebody stick on their head?
I hear that' s a real party place - Wisconsin.
Guess I' il never get to find out.
There' s a blanket in the trailer.
Why don' t you go get it?
My family hates me.
They' il really hate me when they find out.
You didn' t tell 'em?
No.
No one knows.
Not even my boyfriend.
Well, they may be mad, but I don' t think they' re mad enough to wanna lose you or your little problem.
I don' t know about that.
Well, of course, neither do I, but a warm bed and a roof sounds a might better than eatin 'a hot dog on a stick with an old geezer that' s travellin' on a lawn mower.
My daughter Rose is...
Some people call her a little bit slow but she' s not.
She' s got a mind like a bear trap for facts.
She keeps everything organised around the house.
She was a real good mom.
She had four kids.
One night, somebody else was watchin 'the kids and there was a fire.
Her second boy got burned real bad.
Rose had nothin 'to do with it but, ah..... on account of the way Rose is, the State figured she wasn' t competent to take care of them kids and they took' em all away from her.
There isn' t a day goes by that she don' t pine for them kids.
When my kids were real little, I used to play a game with 'em.
I' d give each one of 'em a stick and - one for each one of' em - then I' d say "you break that."
'Course they could, real easy.
Then I' d say "tie them sticks in a bundle and try to break that".
'Course they couldn' t.
Then I' d say "that bundle..... that' s family."
Why don' t you sleep in the trailer?
This chair' sjust fine for me tonight.
No, I' il be fine sleepin 'out here.
Lookin 'at the stars helps me think.
Well...
Thank you.
Woo!
What the...?
What the hell?
Hey, how' re you doin '?
Doin 'good.
Hey, Irene.
You don' t think about gettin 'old when you' re young.
You shouldn' t.
Must be something good about gettin 'old.
Well, I can' t imagine anything good about being blind and lame at the same time, but... still at my age, I' ve seen about all that life has to dish out.
I know to separate the wheat from the chaff and let the small stuff fall away.
Let' s go, man. >
So, ah... what' s the worst part about being old, Alvin?
The worst part of being old is rememberin 'when you was young.
Can I help you, lady?
No, you can' t help me.
No one can help me.
I' ve tried driving with my lights on, sounding my horn!
I scream, I roll the window down and bang on the door and play Public Enemy real loud!
I' ve prayed to St Francis of Assisi, St Christopher too!
What the heck!
I hit at least one deer!
I have hit 13 deer in seven weeks driving down this road!
And I HAVE to drive down this road every day, 40 miles to work and back.
I HAVE to drive to work and I HAVE to drive home!
Where do they come from?
Oh... he' s dead.
And I LOVE deer.
Well, they sure picked the right place to practise a burn on.
(Man) That Rumelthanger place was an eyesore.
< What do you suppose...?
(Woman) Is that a lawn mower?
(Breathes deeply) (Man) Mister, you OK?
Jeez, mister, you' re lucky she didn' t roll on you.
I guess the belt broke.
(Man) I wouldn' t be surprised.
You don' t have brakes on that trailer, right?
I worked for John Deere for 30 years, you shouldn' t be hauling a rig behind a mower.
At least not down a hill like that.
I' m Danny Riordan.
Alvin Straight.
Alvin, let' s get you and this rig off the road and see what the damage is.
Let' s get this off the road.
Sure you' re OK?
OK.
You OK?
Everything all right?
I' m going back to the exercise.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Well,... let' s take a look at this mower.
- This is what '65,' 66?
- '66.
Well,... tell you right now, Alvin, you won' t be going anywhere tonight.
Aside from your, ah, drive belt being busted, you got transmission problems.
- Where you headed?
- Mount Zion.
Mount Zion, Wisconsin?
Past Prairie du Chien?
That' s 60 more miles of hills.
That' s across the Mississippi.
(Danny) What' s in Mount Zion, Alvin?
My brother lives there.
- Why didn' t you take your car?
- I' m not licensed.
- (Woman) Couldn' t he visit?
- He' s had a bad stroke.
Where are you coming from?
Back a piece.
(Danny) West Union?
- Hawkeye?
- Nope.
Well, not New Hampton?
You haven' t come that far.
You' ve come a long ways, haven' t you?
Yeah, I have.
Laurens, Iowa.
(Woman) Laurens?!
That' s west ofThe Grotto.
How long have you been on the road?
What' s the date?
October eighth.
Five weeks.
I left Laurens on the fifth of September.
You been bunkin 'in that?
That' s my rollin 'home.
Where you been settin 'up camp?
In the fields.
I pull off.
I don' t travel at night.
Haven' t you been scared, being alone?
There are weird people everywhere.
Well, ma' am, I fought in the trenches in World War Il.
Why should I be scared of an Iowa cornfield?
Well, um... till we get this mower fixed,... why don' t you... ah, bivouac in our yard here?
There' s a bathroom in the garage you can use.
Well, that' s awful generous of you and I' m sure my machine here is agreeable to that too.
Sure wanna thank you folks for helping me today.
There' s a lot of rain forecast.
Sure don' t want to get stuck in that trailer.
I... I do a little woodwork.
I thought you' d like a few fish.
My daughter does woodwork.
She makes birdhouses.
(Both) Oh, that' s nice.
- You finished there?
- I believe I am.
- I' m in need of a phone.
- Sure.
Come in.
I wanna tell my daughter about my recent travels.
Sure.
Come in.
If it' s all the same with you, do you have a cordless phone?
- Door' s wide open, come...
- I can call from out here.
Here you go.
You' re welcome to sit in the kitchen.
We can leave, if you' re lookin 'for privacy.
Out here' s fine.
Is the area code still 712 here?
No, Alvin.
That hill rolled you into 319.
You need to dial one and your area code.
712, thank you.
'Hello?'
Rose?
Dad?... Dad...
Uh, I' m... so glad to hear you.
It' s gonna cost him a bundle to fix that mower.
I don' t think he' s got that kinda money.
I wouldn' t drive that thing to Excelsior.
It' s a lawn mower, for God' s sake.
Uh, your social security cheque?
Ah... it' s here, Dad.
Rose, can you send me my cheque?
Uh, yeah.
He' s damn lucky he made it down that hill.
- Yeah.
He' s none too strong.
See how he has to walk with the canes?
OK, Dad.
I... I...
OK, OK, Dad, OK.
I... I have a pencil, Dad. < The hillsjust get worse the closer you get to the Mississippi.
Go ahead and drive him, honey.
Mount Zion can' t be half a day.
It' s fine.
You' re a good man, Danny Riordan.
And that' s why I married you, despite what my mother said.
Now, shoo!
Dad?...
I miss you, Dad.
I love you, Rosie.
'I love you too, Dad.'
Uh, bye, Dad.
Bye... Dad.
Ahem.
What are you cookin 'there, Alvin?
Oh, I' m makin 'my Mexican coffee.
Ah.
Mind if I join you?
Get you a chair... that iron one there.
You' il be a guest in your own back yard.
Amm, I talked to the Olsen twins, and, ah... they estimate it' il cost around 250 dollars to get your mower fixed.
Well, that' s twice what it oughta be,
I guess it' s cos they' re twins, huh?
I' d be happy to drive you the rest of the way to Mount Zion.
Be a nice Sunday drive.
We enjoy crossin 'the river, especially now with the trees in colour.
Well, I appreciate that, but..... I wanna finish this one my own way.
Try this.
Thank you.
Well, you know, Alvin, there' s a lotta hills bigger than Clairmont' s between here and Zion.
Even if you get that mower runnin 'again, it may still break down.
Well, you' re a kind man talkin 'to a stubborn man.
I still wanna finish this the way I started.
No, no...
Hi, Verlyn.
- How the heck you doin '?
- Fine.
Wonderful.
He' s there.
Well... they gave you a plate of her brownies.
(Laughs) Yeah.
How' s that for timing?
Janet makes the best brownies... (Both) in Lafayette county.
She won prizes every year at the county fair.
- Mmm... help yourself.
- Thank you.
Mmm... I' ve been doin 'errands and I' m heading for a beer.
I thought you' d like to join me.
Well, I don' t drink any more, but...
I' m always up for a change of scenery.
Well, come on.
Well, I' m ridin 'a little higher and a little faster.
Except when you came down that hill.
I picked up a mournful taste for liquor in France.
When I came back, I couldn' t drink enough of it.
I wasn' t worth a stick of stove wood...
I was mean.
A preacher helped me put some distance between me and the bottle.
And he helped me see... the reason I was drinkin ', I was seein' all them things here, that I' d seen over there.
# Though things may look very dark, your dream is not... #
Lots of men came back drinkin 'hard.
Well... everyone tryin 'to forget.
I can see it in a man right away.
Yup.
# The rainbow, you will suddenly... #
There was one time... when we just...
Were waiting for the first warm meal in ten days.
We... thought we' d seen the worst.
We hadn' t had much trouble from the air.
I was on the rise... with the quartermaster, workin 'on more coffee for me and my buddies.
(Sobbing) A stray Fokker came over the treetops... and dropped an incendiary on the mess tent.
All my buddies...
The Kraut banked right in front of me on that hill... and now I can... see the... Swastika.
That is one thing that I can' t shake loose...
All my buddies faces are still young.
And the thing is, the more years I have, the more they' ve lost.
And it' s not always buddies faces that I see, sometime they' re German faces.
Near the end we were shootin 'moon- faced boys.
I was a sniper.
Where I grew up, you learned how to shoot to hunt food.
They' d post me up front.
Darn near ahead of the lines.
And I' d sit... forever.
It' s an amazing thing what you can see while you' re sittin '.
I' d look for the officers, the radio guys or artillery spotter.
Sometime I' d spot a gun nest by the smoke and I' d fire into it.
Sometime it wasjust a movement in the woods.
We had a scout, a little fella... name of Kotz.
He was a Polish boy from Milwaukee.
He' d always take recon and he was darn good at it.
We went by his word and he saved our skin many a time.
He was a little fella...
We' d broken out of the hedgerows...
We were makin 'a run across the open and we come upon a woods.
We started drawin 'fire.
I took my usual position... and I saw somethin 'movin', real slow like.
I waited ten minutes, it moved again and I shot.
The movement stopped.
The next day we found Kotz... head shot.
He' d been workin 'his way back toward our lines.
Everyone in the unit thought a German sniper had taken him...
Everyone, all these years.
Everyone but me.
Ha ha!
See, Harald... brainiac...
Got the mower assembly free with this here little old wrench...
You said it wouldn' t work.
Wouldn' t you?
So help me slide her out.
We can get settled up.
Uh... I got parts and labour that add up to $247. 80.
Well, I' d say that' s a little heavy for light work.
Don' t you think?
I' ve got an old man' s eyes, but, ah...
I' m noticin 'some new tyre here.
Well, now... ah, we got those off a resell, but the treads are good!
Well, friend, are you chargin 'me for good or for new?
Ahhhh... Thorvald?
Ahh... we can make an adjustment there.
Well, I think the adjustment should be about thirty dollars.
Is that what your pencil' s sayin '?
And, ah... about the labour...
I appreciate that you boys have done some real time on this... of course, a man' s gotta ask when he' s workin 'with twins - especially a bickerin' pair - how much workin 'was fightin'?
(Danny) He got that right.
(Both) Shut up, Danny.
I would calculate maybe 20 per cent taken off the labour.
Anything else, mister?
I would say that that was a little rich for Iowa oil.
Take the oil, no charge.
Well, that' s a splendid offer and I do appreciate it.
What' s the tally?
Ah... ahhh...
Hundred and eighty even?
(Chuckles)
Thanks to you boys, I' m gonna get this rig back on the road.
I' ve drove it all the way across Iowa and I' m hopin 'it holds on till I get to Wisconsin.
My brother lives there.
I haven' t seen him in ten years.
There' s no one knows your life better than a brother that' s near your age.
He knows who and what you are better than anyone on Earth.
My brother and I said some... unforgivable things the last time we met, but, I' m tryin 'to put that behind me.
And this trip is a hard swallow... of my pride,
I just hope I' m not too late.
A brother' s a brother.
Well,...
Guess I' il be turnin 'in.
I' il, ah... see you in the morning, then, before you go.
I' m gonna leave awful early.
I wanna thank you for your kindness to a stranger.
It' s been a genuine pleasure havin 'you here, Alvin.
Write to us, sometime.
I will.
I noticed your campfire.
I brought you some dinner...
Mashed potatoes, meat loaf.
Well, thank you kindly.
I' ve had my dinner, but would you join me for a while?
Sure.
Thank you.
I hope you don' t mind me trespassin '.
Oh, no, not at all.
Made a fine choice.
You' re camped next to one of the oldest cemeteries in the Midwest.
French Catholic trappers.
- The Marquette party.
- Two of his men.
I couldn' t help but notice the rather unusual mode of transport.
Well, you' re not the first person to notice that, Padre.
My eyes are bad.
I can' t drive.
I don' t like someone else drivin 'the bus, and I need to get to my brother' s.
Fair enough.
Where is he?
Well, he' s so close, I can practically feel him.
Mount Zion.
What' s his name?
Lyle Straight.
Is he that fella that came in with a stroke some weeks ago?
Do you know him?
I work at the hospital in Boscobel.
I remember him comin 'in.
Caught my attention because... he lives in my parish.
Well, he' s a Baptist.
Oh, I believe he told me that.
Told me a few things, matter of fact, but he didn' t mention having a brother.
Well, neither one of us has had a brother for quite some time.
So, you saw him?
Is he all right?
I only saw him that once and I haven' t heard anything more.
Well, Lyle and I grew up as close as brothers could be.
We were raised on a farm in Moorhead, Minnesota.
We worked hard.
My mom and dad darn near killed themselves tryin 'to make that farm work.
And me and Lyle would make games out of our chores.
We' d dream up somethin 'about racin' and wagerin 'do anything to keep our mind off the cold.
Lord, it was cold.
He and I used to sleep out in the yard every summer night, if it wasn' t pourin '.
Nine months of winter, we couldn' t get enough summer.
We' d bunk down when the sun went down.
We' d talk to each other until we went to sleep.
We' d talk about the stars and whether there might be somebody else like us out in space, places we wanted to go and... it made our trials seem smaller.
Yeah, we pretty much talked each other through growin 'up.
Oh, whatever happened between you two?
Story as old as the Bible.
Cain and Abel.
Anger, vanity.
You mix that together with liquor, and... you' ve got two brothers who haven' t spoken in ten years.
Well, whatever it was that made me and Lyle so mad... don' t matter any more.
I wanna make peace.
like we used to do... so long ago.
Well, sir...
I say "Amen" to that.
Howdy.
I haven' t had a drink in a lot of years.
Now I' m gonna have me a beer.
What flavour?
What does a Miller' s Lite taste like?
There you go.
- How' s it taste?
- It' s good.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.
It' s an interesting rig you got outside.
Get up the hill OK?
That hill and 200 more just like it.
How far did ya come?
From Iowa.
I' m headed for Lyle Straight' s place.
Iowa!
My God, you must be thirsty. < (Cough) < (Scraping)
Another beer?
This will do me fine.
I wonder could you point me to Lyle' s place?
I haven' t seen him in an awful long time.
Well, you just... ah, cross 61 here, on "W",
(Barman) On your right will be Lyle' s place.
If he' s there that is.
How you doin '...?
Not too good.
This thing' sjust tired.
Is there anything I can do to help you?
Well, I don' t know.
Itjust quit on me.
Why don' t you try her again?
I' m headin 'to Lyle Straight' s place.
Lyle!
Lyle?
(Lyle) Alvin?
(Husky voice) Sit down, Alvin.
Did you ride that thing all the way out here to see me?
I did, Lyle.
Why not call it the Pecu?
Or the Nipia one?
I' m just saying how do we know it' s an ice age?
Because of all the ices!
Well, things just got a little peculiar.
Help!
Help!
Come on, kids, let' s go.
The berg is moving.
But, dad...
No "but".
You can play later.
Okay.
Come on, guys.
Sally, where' s Eddie?
He said something about being on a verge of a revolutionary breakthrough.
Really?
I' m flying!
Look out!
A mammoth is on its way.
Hey, do the world a favour!
Move your issue off the road!
lf my trunk was that small, I wouldn' t draw attention to myself, pal.
Give me a break.
We' ve been wandering with our babies.
Go ahead.
Follow the crowd.
Be quiet when you' re gone.
Come on.
I' m up, I' m up!
Rising sign, everybody.
Zeke?
Mashu?
Birdie?
Uncle Fungis?
Where is everybody?
Come on, guys.
My patient.
They left without me.
They do this every year!
Why?
Doesn' t anyone love me?
lsn' t there anyone who cares about Sid the Sloth?
All right, I' il just go by myself.
Stinks!
Hey, wait, buddy!
Tell me next time!
I can' t believe it.
Fresh and green.
Frank, you' re cutest ever.
Go ahead, pick it.
A dandelion.
I thought the frost wipe them all out.
All but one.
Make me so...
This is definitely not been my day.
You know what I' m saying, buddy?
What a mess.
Hey, you rhino, you have really nice race, do you know that?
It' s just a fact.
You know what I' m talking about.
A dandelion.
Must be the last one of season.
Carlo.
Easy, Frankie.
He ruined our salad.
Oh, my mistake.
It' s my mistake.
Let me...
No, seriously, let me take care of this.
Oh.
What is this?
My goodness, that' s my favourite.
Hmm, delicious.
That' s a... good eating.
Don' t let me have it all.
Yes, you have some.
Tasty, isn' t it?
Gonna have to pick tooth.
Now?
Now.
Please save me.
I wanna hit him full speed.
That' s okay, Frank.
We' il have some fun with him.
Don' t let them kill me, please.
I wanna live!
Get off me!
Come on, you' re making a scene.
We just take off free and go.
Do your mind?
Buddy, if not them today, it' s just someone else tomorrow.
I rather not be today.
Okay?
How' s that?
Wait a minute.
I thought rhinos are vegetarians.
An active point.
Shut up!
Who says we gonna eat him after we kill him?
Come on, move it.
You know, I don' t like animals to kill for pleasure.
Sid, for matters that cares.
I' m the matter that cares.
Okay, look. lf either of you make it across that sink hole in front of you, you get this one.
That' s right, you losers.
You take a step and you' re dead.
You' re bluffing, huh?
Yeah, that was a bluff.
Go!
A dandelion?
We' re steady!
What?
You have beautiful eyes.
Get off my face.
You and me, we make a great team.
What do you say we just head South together?
Yeah, jump on my back and relax your whole way.
Really?
No.
Wait, aren' t you going to South?
The changing season, emigrational things?
ls it ringing a bell?
I guess not, pal.
Okay, thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.
Hey, you over grown weasel.
Wait till we get down there.
The whole South thing is way out.
The heat, the crowd.
This great.
You and me, two guys knocking about in the wild.
No, you just want a bodyguard so you don' t become somebody' s side dish.
You' re very strut mammoth.
Can you lead the way, Mr. Big Guy?
Manfred.
How about Mandy the moody mammoth or nanny the...
Stop following me.
Okay, so you got it.
You won' t even know I' m here.
I' il just zip the lip when I say...
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.
lsn' t it nice if he joining us for breakfast?
It wouldn' t be breakfast without him.
And rag our skin to keep warm.
And ruin our lives.
Don' t you think?
Let show that human what happen when he messed with Sabers.
Alert the troops.
We attack at dawn.
Alive.
lf I' m gonna enjoy my revenge, I want it to be fresh.
I' m wiped out.
That' s your shelter?
You' re a big guy.
You got a lot of woods.
I' m a little guy.
You only got a stick.
Yeah, but with my little stick, and my highly evolved brain...
I' il start the fire.
We' il see if breeze try to blow us tonight.
Now won' t we?
Hey, I think I saw its flare.
Any chance I can squeeze in there with you?
lsn' t there someone else you can annoy?
Friends?
Family?
Poison reptiles?
My family is bad.
They just kind of migrate without me.
You should see what they did last year.
They buried the cave door, and covered their tracks.
They made it anyway.
So what about you?
You got family?
Okay, you' re tired, I see.
We' il talk tomorrow morning.
Manfred?
Manfred.
Could you move over?
Come on, nobody fall asleep that fast.
Mandy!
That' s Diego, fall back!
Where' s the baby?
I lost it over the falls.
You lost it?
I' il get it.
You better.
Unless you want to serve yourself as the replacement.
We' il go up to half peak.
Meet us there.
It' d better be alive.
Can we trust you with that, Diego?
Let' s go!
And you pick this year off my shoulders.
lf you gonna have a mating partner, at least pick a female with the same color palette, right?
And I thought, wow, he' s gonna go primal, you know what I' m saying?
lf you find a mate in life, you should be loyal.
ln your case, it' s grateful.
Get away from me.
Well, I think mate in life is stupid.
I mean everybody just sit around...
Mandy?
Look at that.
He' s okay.
She' s gone.
Hey, Mandy, are you forgetting something?
No.
But you just saved him.
Yeah, but I' m still trying to get rid of the last thing I saved.
You can' t leave him here.
Look, there' s smoke.
That' s his heir right up the hill.
We should return him.
Let' s get something straight.
There' s no "we".
There never was a "we".
ln fact, without me, there wouldn' t even be a "you"!
Just up the hill.
Listen very carefully.
I' m not g- o- i- n- g.
Fine.
Be a jerk.
I' il take care of him.
Go.
Yeah, that' s good.
You take care of him?
You can' t even take care of yourself.
This I gotta see.
I' il return him.
You know we do.
You' re embarrassing the nature, do you know that?
I' m fine.
I' m fine!
I' m gonna die.
That thing is mine.
No, actually that thing belongs to us.
Us?
You two are barely a couple.
There is no "us".
I see.
You can have one of your own so you won' t adopt.
But we gotta go.
The baby, please.
I' m returning to his heir.
Oh, yeah.
Nice try, bucktooth.
You' re calling me a lair?
I didn' t say that.
You were thinking it.
I don' t like this cat.
He reads mind.
Name is Diego, friend.
Manfred.
And I' m not your friend.
Fine, Manfred.
lf you' re looking for its heir, you' re wasting your time.
He left this morning.
Thanks for the advice.
I beat this.
All right, I' il help you bring it to its heir.
But promise me you' d leave me alone after that.
Okay, deal.
What' s your problem?
You' re my problem.
But I think you' re stressed.
That' s why you eat so much.
It' s hard to get fat on a diet.
I' m not fat.
It' s all this fur.
It makes me look puffy.
Fat hair.
But when you' re ready to talk, I' m here.
Just drop it on the land.
Shouldn' t we make sure they found him?
Good idea.
No, no, no!
Wait.
Don' t spear me!
This is a problem.
Now what?
That' s perfect.
I told you they were gone.
Look who it is.
Don' t you have some flaw defenseless animals to disembogue?
They couldn' t be far.
They went this way?
Or this way?
You don' t know much about tracking, do you?
I must lost.
I see trees, either leaves, that' s my tracking.
You didn' t miss them by much.
It' s still green.
They head north 2 hours ago.
ls it?
They head north 2 hours ago.
You don' t need this aggravation.
Give me the baby.
I can track human down faster than you can.
And you' re just a good citizen helping out, right?
I just know where the human will go.
Find the pass.
Everybody knows they have a settlement on the other side.
Unless you know how to track, you never gonna reach them before their pass closed up with snow.
Which should be like, tomorrow.
So you can give that baby to me or go get lost in the blizzard.
It' s your choice.
Here' s your little bundle of joy.
We' il return it to the human.
Big bad Tiddy Widdy get cliff.
Poor Tiddy Widdy...
Sid, Tiddy Widdy is gonna lead the way.
Mandy, can I talk to you for a second?
No.
The sooner we find the human, the sooner I get rid of Mr. Stinky- drew- face.
And the baby too.
You always have that jumbo around to protect you.
And when that day comes, I suggest you watch your back.
Cause I' il be tuning on it.
Human tracker, up front so I can see you.
Help me.
You gotta make him stop.
I can' t tolerate anymore!
I think this thing didn' t complain this much.
Stop shouting at me.
You' re holding it wrong.
Watch its head!
Just put it down.
lts nose is dry.
That means something is wrong with it.
Just in case.
I' il do it.
You know, the baby stinks.
So if it poops, where does it go?
Humans are disgusting.
Okay, you.
Check for poop.
Why am I the poop checker?
And because I' il pound you if you don' t.
What else?
Now, Sid!
I mean, my goodness.
All right, look out.
Coming through.
Watch out!
Stop waving it around!
Oh, I' m gonna slip!
It' s clean!
Got you!
Would you cut it out!
Hey, do that again.
He likes it.
That makes me feel better too.
Turn him towards me.
Where is the baby?
There it is!
Where is the baby?
There it is!
Stop it!
You' re scaring it!
I bet he' s hungry.
How about some milk?
I' d love some.
Not you, the baby.
I ain' t exactly doing it right now, pal.
You alone are the food jamming mouth, aren' t you?
Enough!
Food!
Prepare for ice age!
Protect the Dodo valley!
Survivals separate the Dodo off the peak!
Protect the Dodo valley!
Prepare for ice age!
lce age?
I' ve heard of these cracks, buddy.
lntruders!
Don' t fall in. if you do, you' il physically...
lntruders!
Burned and died.
Hey, can we have our melon back?
Junior is hungry and...
No way!
This is our private stuff for ice age.
Some of us has been looking around for billions billions years.
So you got three melons?
lf you weren' t smart, and I' il cut it into half and throw on you.
Wait for me.
No!
Retrieve the melon!
Attack!
The melon!
There goes our last female.
The last melon!
That' s it.
Now we gonna find more food.
We got dinner on the shore.
Now the meal will be feeding a hungry sloth.
With who?
A vole?
Bedtime.
The triumph has returned.
Shuffle.
How about a good night kiss for you?
Shh.
It' s asleep.
I was talking to you.
Fine, I' il tuck myself in.
Good night.
Would you stop that!
All right.
All right.
Trying to relax.
All right.
What the...
Go ahead.
Slice me.
It' il be the last thing you' d ever do.
I' m working here, you wasted fur.
For who, Diego?
Tracking down human is too difficult for you?
What are you two doing here?
Soto' s getting tired of waiting.
Yeah.
He said, come back with the baby, or don' t come back at all!
I have a message for Soto.
Tell him, I' m bringing the baby.
And tell him, I' m bringing a mammoth.
A mammoth.
Mammoth never travels alone.
This one does.
And I' m leading him to half peak.
Look at all that meat.
Let' s get him!
Not yet!
We need the whole gang to bring this mammoth down.
Get everyone ready.
Now!
Where is the baby?
You lost it?
Sid!
It' s so ugly.
But it' s adorable.
Hello, pumpkin.
Where did you find it?
The poor kid all alone in the wild.
Sabers gang nailed on it.
So I just snatch it.
So brave.
Well, he needed me and I only wish I have with my home.
Really?
I never attracted to a male.
Who wouldn' t want a family, I always say.
Well, you know.
Cute kid, huh?
So I was saying, ladies...
Hey!
Mandy!
What' s the matter with you?
Excuse me, ladies.
You just keep aggregating and I' il be right back.
He' s not much to look at but it' s so hard to find a family guy.
Tell me about it.
But the sensitive ones get eaten.
No, please.
I beg you, I need him.
Why?
A good looking guy like you?
You say that but you don' t mean it.
No, seriously, look at you.
Most ladies, they don' t stand the chance.
We have a very cool sense of humour.
Don' t let me crap this time.
Thanks, man.
You' re the best.
Without the baby.
Mandy, I need him.
So, ladies, where were we?
Carlo?
Easy, Frankie.
Somebody moves like a cheater.
And that tiger.
Yeah, Mr. Great Tracker.
Can' t even find a sloth.
What am l?
Head winder?
What are you looking at?
Look at you.
You gonna grow into a big predator, huh?
I don' t think so.
What do you got?
little patched fur, no teeth, no claws.
Your foot is skin- wrap in mulish.
What so threatening about you?
Okay.
All right, wise guy.
You just started time out.
You think that' s funny?
How about this?
You' il lose snack in an hour.
I' m a little square to give you that.
Thank goodness.
Oh, a tiger!
Help!
Help!
Where' s the baby?
The rhinos are after me.
So think about it.
He got me!
Help...
Get away from me.
This way.
Over here.
No, Carlo!
The tiger beat us to him.
Wait a minute.
It' s dead, all right.
No.
Carlo, where' s your all upon?
I hate to bend like that.
But you know how it is.
All right, thanks.
You can put me down now.
Mandy!
Guys, I thought we' re in a hurry.
When Diego speaks that out, you' re gonna wiped.
Boy.
For a second, I actually thought you gonna eat me.
I don' t eat junk food.
I thought you' re gonna...
Were you?
Wait up.
Wait up!
Can you wait a second, please?
Hey, fellows!
Thanks for waiting.
3, 2, 1.
Sure is faithful.

I' il finish it.
Modern architecture.
It' d never last.
Hey, Mandy.
Hey, Diego.
Hey, Sid.
You' re lost, aren' t you?

March!
Not march., either way
You' ve sold us a bill of goods, Gordon.
Promised new drugs to fight everything from the common cold to cancer.
- We' il deliver everything we promised.
- I' m sorry, but the adventure is over.
We' re exercising our option to liquidate...... Byron & Mitchell Research Limited.
Jack, show these people how filthy rich we' re gonna make them, please.
I don' t think you understand what I just said.
Oh, I think I understand.
Jack.
Perrinia immortalis.
The Blood Orchid.
First described in 1 892 by Houghton...... the last person to see it until our team brought a sample from Borneo.
It lies dormant for seven years, then blooms for just six months.
Which means we just got lucky as hell, gentlemen.
Anyone here familiar with the Hayflick limit?
He proposed a cell could only replicate 56 times...... before it died from a buildup of toxins.
According to him, it' s the reason we die.
But what if we could transcend that limit?
That would be impossible.
Not according to our data.
Our research indicates the presence of a chemical in Perrinia immortalis...... that can significantly prolong cellular life.
I can' t support this.
Does that mean what I think it means?
Are we talking about a pharmaceutical equivalent...... to the fountain of youth?
Exactly.
That' d be bigger than Viagra.
- Have you put this into human trials?
- We can' t yet.
Our sample was degraded in the initial study.
We need more of the orchid.
See, and that' s our only problem, gentlemen.
That orchid is only in bloom for another two weeks.
Well, what the hell are you waiting for?
Get your asses down to Borneo.
Yes.
- Welcome to Borneo.
- Thanks.
- What' s wrong with this picture?
Let me see, you' re in it?
We don' t have a boat, okay?
Your company had one responsibility: get a boat.
- And you' ve already screwed it up.
Your girl chartered the boat.
Sam confirmed with the company.
They' re waiting for your payment.
Hey, I' ve got something.
Payment cleared.
Really?
- Where' s the boat?
- It' s not coming.
All of the charter companies have shut down.
No one' il risk going upriver till after the rainy season.
- And when' s that?
- Two, three weeks.
The orchid' s only in bloom for one more week, tops.
There' s a local captain named Jin- Soon.
I' m told he' il take anyone upriver, for the right price.
Are you sure this is the place?
They said the one with the red door.
I bet you somebody' s playing Russian roulette in there.
Maybe we' il get lucky and you' il get a turn.
Hey, why don' t you two just get a room.
Come on, Sam.
Wait here.
Yeah, if you insist.
Hey!
Hey!
Jin- Soon.
Jin- Soon?
Your lndonesian sucks.
- Stick to English.
- We heard you could take us upriver.
In rainy season?
Won' t be cheap.
We can pay you 25, 000.
- I' il have a talk with the captain.
- You' re not the captain?
Jin- Soon!
These tourists need a boat.
I told them not in the rainy season.
- You' re Jin- Soon?
- Local nickname.
Name' s Johnson.
Bill Johnson.
It' s a pronunciation thing.
And you can rent my boat for 25 grand.
Now, you want me to drive it, well...... that' il cost you 50.
Fifty grand?
Are you high?
You know what?
Don' t answer that.
I' m not trusting him with the expedition.
Listen.
Lady.
Let' s cut the bullshit, please.
If one of the other charter companies could take you...... you' d be on the river by now.
You only came to me because you' re desperate.
Fifty grand' s my price.
Take it...... or leave it.
I' ve seen subway cars in better shape than this.
Yeah, she may be ugly...... but she puts out.
- Shit!
- What took you so long?
Hey, you try getting a GPS locator, a Sat- Nav EchoStar...... and a UV spectrometer past lndonesian customs.
- Complaining already.
- Yeah.
- You rather be back in the office?
- Hell, yeah.
I had courtside seats at the Garden on Saturday.
I was gonna sit right between Spike and Woody.
Oh, man, is that our ride?!
Look at the bright side, Cole.
At least the weather' s nice.
Ben Douglas, team doctor.
You must be Sam.
Yeah.
We spoke on the phone.
Glad to have you aboard.
I' m gonna get you for this.
Oh, yeah.
This could be fun.
You can forget about that, dog.
That' s one car you ain' t never gonna catch.
There' s always a way.
- Your team' s a little green, huh?
- My former grad students.
Best in their field.
Here' s a tip for Wexell- Hall:
You want the best young talent...... recruit early.
Yes, I' m sure Sam' s very talented.
I think I resent that.
You and the other gal can stay in here.
You live here.
The way you say that, I can tell you' re impressed.
All right.
If you need anything....
Well...... if you need anything, you' re shit out of luck.
Okay.
Now, this is where the exploratory team found the orchid.
In the Selatan Basin.
- It took them three days to get upriver.
- Yeah.
That was before the rainy season.
These waterways could be dangerous now.
- You said you' d get us there safely.
- And I will.
But safe isn' t always quick.
We' il work our way up one bend at a time.
If I don' t like what I see, we change course.
Can' t chart the fastest route before you begin.
Already have.
All right.
Now, we' re uplinked in real time to NASA and AsiaSatCom.
Now, under ideal conditions...... this is the fastest route.
But once we superimpose weather patterns for the past 1 0 years...... and then extrapolate....
Bingo!
It' s Padrang to the Selatan Basin.
I' m a bad man.
We got less than a week to get to that orchid.
If you can' t get the job done, give our money back...
-... and we' il get somebody who can.
- I' il get you there.
God help me.
Something attacked me!
- Oh, my God!
- She said something attacked her.
No, no, no!
It' s okay.
It' s okay.
What the hell' d you do?
You scared him.
I scared him?!
This is Kong.
Kong lives here.
You' re guests.
Be nice.
Disgusting animal.
You okay now?
I' m fine.
Just keep your hands off of me.
Oh, yeah.
Well, it' s gonna be tough, but I' il try.
No, no, the S- 1 has to be on file before the week is out.
- That' s the whole point.
- Hello?
- The S- 1 needs to be on file before....
- Yes, we were able to get on the river.
That' s the purpose.
We need the comments from the SEC.
- Excuse me.
- It' s the only place I can get reception.
- No, just get it done.
Be ready to go....
- No, that' s impossible....
- Hello?
Hello?
- Hello?
Bob?
Damn it!
Try my phone.
Works just as good, but it' s free.
Okay.
Maybe you can use my special antenna to boost your reception.
We' re dealing with a lithophytic vine, so we want to search any rock face.
Now, this ridge here seems a good bet.
Sam.
Come on, Sam.
What do you say?
We' re young.
We' re single.
We' re in Borneo.
What do you got to lose?
Not satisfied, walk away.
No commitments.
"No commitments."
That' s your pitch?
Did I say "No commitments"?
I meant marry me.
Am I gonna be dealing with this for the next two weeks?
Yep.
So you were one of Jack' s students?
Yeah.
He was teaching a seminar on botanical pharmacology.
Soon as I finished my dissertation, he hired me.
Well, that' s one way to get a leg- up.
What' s that supposed to mean?
I had a professor who wanted to hire me.
Of course, he wanted me to be his secretary.
Look, if I' ve done something to offend you --
No, dear, not at all.
Actually, I admire you.
Took me 1 0 years to get where I am.
Clearly, your generation has it figured out.
Man, this is good.
Where' d you learn to cook like this?
- Little recipe I picked up in Sri Lanka.
- What were you doing there?
Doctors Without Borders.
It' s my day job.
You guys expect to need a doctor?
Can' t get the expedition bonded without one.
Well, you just think of me as a charming insurance policy.
Hey!
You' ve had your dinner.
Get out of here.
What' d I say?
There' s not that much....
I' m not sleeping up there.
I ain' t sleeping on the floor.
I ain' t sleeping on no damn....
- Oh, shit.
What was that?
- What the hell was that?
- Something' s getting eaten.
- By what?
Everything gets eaten out here.
It' s the jungle.
Kong.
Hey.
You guys seen Kong?
No.
Not since last night.
Where are you?
Kong?
We need those results by next month if we want the FDA off our backs.
Hello?
Shit!
I can' t hear you!
Can you hear me now?
How about now?
Can you hear me now?
- Can you hear me now?
- We can!
Can you hear me now?
- Gail!
Oh, my God.
- Shit.
Stop the boat!
- I' il go.
- All right.
Hey, Gail!
Can you hear me now?!
Oh, I' m gonna kill you!
Stroke, Gail, stroke.
Come on.
- Watch your back.
- Hey, Gail!
How' s the water?
Drop the phone.
It' s probably holding you back.
- All right.
- Stay calm.
- Stay calm.
- Use your phone for flotation.
All right, come on, Gail.
- You' re almost there.
- It' s just like a phone.
I got it.
- Holy shit!
- Holy shit!
Come on!
Come on!
- Get out!
- Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Come on!
- Gail, grab it.
- Look out!
- Watch out!
Oh, my God.
Get him, Bill!
Get him, Bill!
Get him in the eye, man!
Bill?
Where' d he go?
- Where' d he go?!
- Bill!
I don' t see him.
- Where' s he gone?
- Oh, my God.
Oh, shit, you won.
- You' re okay?
- I lost my phone.
Sorry to hear it.
That was either the bravest or the stupidest thing I' ve ever seen.
It' s a fine line.
- Good as new.
- Thanks.
To Gail...... who knows it' s better to eat than be eaten.
- To Gail.
- Yeah, yeah, baby.
Almost eaten just to find a flower.
- Hardly seems worth it.
- Oh, it' s worth it.
I mean, think about it.
A pill that you take every day for the rest of your life.
Now, even if we charge, say, a dollar a pop... -... we' re billionaires.
- At $1 00 a bottle...... I' il dive in that river and fight that croc myself.
So how many flowers does it take to save the world?
Figure 50 orchids will yield about an ounce of chemical.
You could have a football field full of those orchids...... still doesn' t mean you can get it through human trials.
She doesn' t even believe in you.
Comes with the territory.
And there' s always someone waiting to chop it off.
Where the hell have you been?
- Damn that thing!
- Where you been, boy?
Calm down.
Calm down.
- Poor guy.
- It' s okay.
It' s all right.
Looks like he' s seen a ghost.
It' s all right.
It' s all right.
It' s all right.
What if Gail' s right?
I mean, cells in a petri dish are one thing.
- Human trials are another.
- She' s wrong.
And when it goes to product...... and you and I can cash in our stock options...
-... we' il rub her face in it.
- Stock options.
I spoke to Mitchell.
We' re each giving you half a point.
I don' t know what to say.
Don' t say anything.
You deserve it.
All this...... wouldn' t be possible without your work.
Jack.
Thought we decided against that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You' re right.
It would be fun, though.
I mean, here we are, traveling upriver...... to the greatest discovery of our careers.
Now, if this orchid thing works out, then...... who knows?
Is that why I' m here?
So you can give us one more try?
You' re here because you' re the best researcher I' ve got.
Am I interrupting something?
No.
No, I was....
- I was just going to bed.
- Yeah.
Well, before you do that, we need to talk.
We got a problem.
See the water level?
In high water, the Mendranang gets rough.
We could turn around, try to find another course.
- But that would take at least two days.
- We don' t have the time.
If the river becomes impassable, it' il take a lot longer.
And if we turn back, then we' re definitely screwed.
We' re gonna have to risk it.
What if I don' t wanna risk it?
Do you have any idea what this flower means?
We' re talking about the biggest medical discovery in history.
That does sound great, Jack.
But I was never any good at history.
You want me to risk the Mendranang...... it' il cost you an extra 50 thousand.
Done.
Done?
You gotta ask the boss lady or something?
I' il pay it myself.
All right.
You got yourself a deal.
But if we hit trouble...... your people do what I say, you got that?
You' re the captain.
Research proposals?
Yeah.
Research proposals.
You' re not the only company we' re in bed with.
We' re the prettiest and most popular.
Like sleeping with the head cheerleader.
Not quite.
Come on, you know you love us.
I love your cash.
Then let me get a look at that file.
After this orchid thing goes bust, you' il be finished at Wexell- Hall.
Unless you got something else lined up.
You really wanna see us fail, don' t you?
No.
I just think that you will.
I am a scientist, you know.
Scientist.
What' re you doing at Wexell- Hall?
I like science.
I just like money better.
I' il drink to that.
River' s flooded.
We can' t see the banks.
Miss our turnoff?
It' s just ahead.
What the hell was that?
- Rudder' s jammed.
- What?
Watch out.
Shit!
Get up!
Everybody up!
Hey.
What' s going on?
Goddamn it.
Shit!
We' ve blown the head gasket.
Are we all right?
Hey, what' s going on?
- What is it?
- We got problems.
- What' s wrong, man?
- Bill, wait.
What are you talking about?
What problems?
Son of a bitch.
The current' s too strong.
- We missed our turnoff.
- I know.
Come on, baby.
Come on, man.
- What is it?
- What is it?
What do you see?
Come on.
You got this.
Come on, girl.
Hang on!
- Hang on to what?!
Come on!
Oh, shit!
Holy shit.
It' s sinking, it' s sinking!
- Where' s Cole?
- Swim to the rocks, this way.
Keep going.
- Come on, get to the rocks.
- Get to the rocks.
- Where' s Cole?
Cole!
- Over there.
Over there!
Over there!
Come on, man.
Give me your hand!
Come on.
You got it, Sam.
Come on.
Give me your hand.
I' ve got you, I' ve got you.
Give me your hand, give me your hand.
Okay, I got her.
You almost got us killed!
You almost got us killed!
You think I wanted this?
I just lost my damn boat!
You' il lose your pay if you don' t get us out.
You said you' d get us there safely.
You should' ve turned around.
That' s enough!
There' s nothing we can do about that now.
It' s a waste of energy.
What have we got?
Some specimen jars, a map, a little water, no food.
Hard drive' s ruined.
Well, pretty much all the equipment' s shot.
Except one of the SAT phones still works.
It' s on- line.
Thank God, we can call the police.
Police.
The nearest river patrol is back in Padrang.
The only way to get to us is over that.
Are you saying we' re stuck here?
Maybe not.
We' re here.
The valley' s completely flooded.
But I got a friend who operates a boat on the Tokut River.
I can give him a call, and he can meet us here at Naga Rock.
How far is that?
I don' t know.
A two- day hike down the river.
But if we bushwhack, we cut at least a day off the trek.
Oh, my God.
You wanna go through that?
It' s the shortest way.
We could be safely in the Tokut by nightfall.
So we can continue with the expedition.
- Yeah.
I' il get you to the flower.
- I don' t care about that flower...
-... just get us to safety.
- It' s the same thing.
We can either be on my buddy' s boat in 1 0 hours, or we can sit here...... and wait for the river patrol for days.
Your friend.
Is he reliable?
Absolutely.
You better not screw me on this.
Sounds like you' re already screwed, mate.
Pay you two grand.
I need you on this one, John.
Yes, yes, so it seems.
Look, Billy, I' d love to help you out, but I' m flat out, mate, you know.
Probably squeeze you in for, say, 5 grand?
You' re killing me.
That' s mates rates.
Or you could always...... hike back to Padrang if you wanna save bucks.
- Up to you, pal.
Five.
- Yes!
- But you better be there.
Otherwise, I' il tell your wife about that little trip to Bangkok.
Wife' s long gone, Billy.
Long gone, mate.
All right, people, we' re on.
Saddle up.
Stay together.
This jungle is all green all the time, and you will get lost.
It' s like doing a StairMaster in a sauna.
Yeah.
I might die of a heat stroke, but I' il have a nice tight ass.
That' s the spirit, Cole.
- You want me to grab that?
- ls that a trick question?
Here, man.
Right between Spike and Woody.
Right between Spike and Woody.
You okay, Sam?
I' m fine.
See, a crisis separates the real men from the pretenders.
Yeah.
Can see that.
What, that?
That' s nothing.
I tricked him into taking my bag.
Hey.
Mind if I give it a try?
Knock yourself out.
Hey.
I' m sorry about your boat.
Yeah, well...... it was a piece of shit anyway.
Can we go around?
But we' d lose another day.
Let' s go.
Shit.
Knock it off.
- Shit!
What was that?
- What was what?
- Something just moved.
- Please don' t say that.
I' m serious.
Something moved.
"Something just moved" as in something' s alive?
Shit!
There it is again.
There' s something in here!
There' s probably a million things in here.
He' s right.
Just keep moving.
Stop it.
I swear to God, if you don' t stop it....
Very funny.
Ben?
- Where' d he go?
- Shit!
Help me!
Run!
- What the hell was that thing?!
- Anaconda.
- Oh, great!
- There' s snakes out here that big?
- Yes, but -- - But what?
It swallowed him whole!
Calm down and listen for a second.
I can explain --
No, you calm down and listen!
Ben was eaten by a freaking snake.
- Okay?
A freaking snake!
- Cole.
- Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
I mean....
- Cole.
Oh, my God, did you see that thing?
We don' t got a chance against that!
I mean, Mitchell.
Mitchell.
Listen to me, man.
I watch the Discovery Channel.
I' m telling you, we got no chance!
You understand?
I mean, we' re gonna die, girl.
We' re gonna die!
Cole, calm down.
Okay?
- Okay?
- All right, Jack, I' m okay.
Okay.
I' m gonna sit right here.
Listen.
Anacondas are territorial.
A snake that size will hunt a huge area.
There won' t be another one for miles.
We gotta get to the boat.
It' s not that far.
So if we keep moving and stick together... -... we should be fine.
- We should be?!
How big do they get?
That was the biggest one I' ve ever seen by far.
A freak of nature.
The odds of running into another that size are astronomical.
Yeah, but how do we know the one that got Ben...... is not gonna come after us?
It takes them weeks to digest.
Meal like that, he' il be sleeping it off for a while.
Let' s just get to that boat and get home.
What about the orchid?
You' ve gotta be kidding me.
It won' t bloom for another seven years.
- This expedition is over, Jack.
- Now, hold on a second, Gail.
- There' s a lot of money at stake here.
- I don' t care.
Ben is dead!
We have lost someone.
As Wexell- Hall' s representative, I am calling this expedition off.
- You don' t have the authority.
- Check your contract.
We' re in the middle of the jungle.
At this point, your authority is what we say it is.
Jack, I' m with her.
I gotta get the hell out of here, man.
Look.
Ben was my friend, okay?
I got him into this, and no one feels worse about it than I do.
I don' t wanna do anything stupid.
I just wanna accomplish what we came here for.
If we turn back now, Ben' s death would be for nothing.
Let' s just get back to the boat.
We can regroup and make our decision then.
Fine.
Jack.
- Maybe Gail' s right.
- She' s just scared.
Once we get back to the boat, she' il be okay.
When we get back to the boat, this expedition is over.
I' m taking these people to safety.
Hey, hey, hey.
We had a deal.
Keep your money, doc.
Someone is dead.
We' re officially in over our heads.
You said we wouldn' t run into another one of them.
And we probably won' t, but I can' t guarantee it.
So I' il get you to the boat...... and after that we' re done.
Well, that answers it.
That answers nothing.
I' il just throw more money at him at the boat.
If he doesn' t take it, I' il offer his friend the same deal.
- Jack.
Maybe we should listen -- - lf we don' t get to that orchid now...... all of our work will have been for nothing.
I need your support, okay?
You have as much riding on this as I do.
Don' t let me down.
I saw this special on Animal Planet.
Anacondas are vicious.
They hunt for sport.
Just use their tongues to sense body heat --
Shut the hell up.
I knew this guy who knew this guy who shot documentaries.
He went to the Amazon with this crew, and they were all eaten by snakes.
Come on, you knew a guy who knew a guy, that' s an urban myth.
I' m sorry about Ben.
I never should' ve stayed on the Mendranang.
What do you mean?
Well, I figured he didn' t tell the others, but I thought you knew.
Knew what?
Byron offered me an extra 50 grand to stay on the river.
I told him it might get rough, but he wanted to risk it.
Hey.
Don' t blame him.
It was my call.
I took the money.
I thought I could get us through.
You wanna blame anyone?
You blame me.
These boots are killing me.
- Cole.
- What?
You got some....
Oh, God, what is that?!
Get it off!
Get it off!
- Oh, my God!
Take it off!
- Relax.
- Help me!
Help me!
- Hold on.
- Get it off me!
- Hey!
Calm down!
- Get this off me!
- Calm down!
Cole!
Cole!
Calm down.
What is it?
What is it?
- Get it off me.
Get it off.
- All right.
Look.
- Just a lighter.
Just a lighter.
- Oh, hell no!
You ain' t burning me!
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
You burn me, I' il kill you.
- Okay, okay, okay.
- All right.
- You all right?
You okay?
- Yeah.
I' m fine.
- What?
- Hold on.
Put your arms up.
What are you doing?
Why are you going under my shirt?
- What are you doing?
- Jesus.
What, what?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
Anybody got a blowtorch?
Stop!
Careful.
- What' s it --?
Paralyzed, like stone, for two days.
- What do you call this fella?
- Laba laba batu.
Stone spider.
I may have discovered a valuable new anesthetic agent for Wexell- Hall.
Oh, no, no, no.
Forget Wexell, we can get this to the highest bidder.
All right.
Show and tell' s over.
We gotta get to that boat.
Put your boots on and let' s go.
Bugger it.
What the hell was that?
Holy bloody hell.
Whoa!
What was that?
Oh, my God.
What the hell was that?
Come on.
No, no, no!
Oh, come on, man!
What the hell happened?!
Livingston!
Here we go.
He got drunk and fell off the bloody boat!
Your friend!
Your friend!
Now what we gonna do now?!
Shit!
Search the wreckage.
Find anything we can use.
And hope to God there' s a phone.
Come on, come on.
Yes.
Hello?
Hello?
- Come on, come on!
- Anything?
- Nothing.
- Keep trying.
What do you think I' m doing, Jack?!
Hello?
Shit.
Hello?
Come on, man.
Hello?
All right, keep looking!
No phone?
- Nothing.
- Couldn' t get a signal on the radio.
Now what?
What' s going on?
Where' d these come from?
- Lopaks.
- Who?
Local tribe.
- Descended from headhunters.
- What?
Been in this region for thousands of years.
- Headhunters?
- There' s still some villages here.
- Must be one of their fishing spots.
- Hold on, excuse me.
Did you say headhunters?
There haven' t been practicing headhunters in Borneo for a century.
Just because they ain' t practicing don' t mean they don' t remember how.
They must be along this branch of the river.
If we can find their village, maybe they can lend us a boat.
So wait a minute.
We just gonna walk towards the headhunters, not away?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
Oh, God.
I' m so hungry, I' d sell my grandmother for a Tic Tac.
You mention food one more time...... I' m voting you off this island.
Oh, God.
- ls that --?
- Livingston.
Oh, my God, man.
What the hell happened to him?
Anaconda.
If he was eaten by the snake...
-... why is his body --?
- Listen, listen!
All right.
These things are at their weakest when they digest.
But if threatened, they will spit up their food and attack again.
What?
There' s a snake out there with an empty stomach?
- Yeah.
- The same one that got Ben?
No.
No.
There' s no way that snake could' ve gotten to Livingston.
- It had to be another one.
- You said there wouldn' t be...
-... another one for miles.
- There wouldn' t.
- Unless....
- Unless what?
- Unless it' s mating season.
- Oh, my God.
- Mating season?
- Yeah.
You see, the males are territorial, but when they smell a female in heat...... they come running from everywhere.
Females find a nice, wet, muddy pit, and they all go after her at once...... in one big mating ball.
So there' s some snake orgy out in the jungle?!
Yeah.
Something like that.
Look, we' re losing the light.
All we gotta do is get to that village.
So please, pay attention.
Do not stray from the group.
Let' s go.
Stay quiet.
Sacred burial ground.
Jesus.
I thought you said that anaconda was the biggest you' d ever seen.
It was.
- Well, this one' s....
- Bigger.
The males must' ve come through here looking for the female.
Some bullshit.
- They took their boats.
- Good for them.
Bad for us.
Which one' s the Mendranang?
On the right.
The Tokut keeps going to the left.
- Fastest way to Kotabaru.
- How long?
You' il be soaking in a tub at the Four Seasons in two days.
How, man?
We don' t even have a boat.
We' re gonna build one.
Man, do that in my neighborhood, and that' s your ass.
Shit.
Sam.
What does this look like to you?
My God.
Perrinia immortalis.
Now we know why these snakes are so big.
What?
Anacondas keep growing till they die, right?
And these are the biggest Bill' s ever seen.
- Because they' re living longer.
- Exactly.
Because Perrinia immortalis is part of the food chain.
These snakes have transcended the Hayflick limit.
The chemical in the orchid does exactly what we predicted.
And not in theory, in the real world.
This is proof, Sam, of your research, carved in stone.
This is proof?
It' s anecdotal evidence at best.
- Let' s get to the orchid and find out.
- You are out of your mind.
Do you have any idea how close we are?
The orchid was found here...... on the Mendranang, just around the next bend.
- We' il be going right past it.
- No, we won' t.
We are going down the Tokut.
If we go down the Mendranang, it' s gonna be a week...... before we reach another village.
I' m not waiting that long for my bath.
Yeah, well, it' s not up to you.
Jack.
Maybe you can just come back.
Come back?
In seven years?
What if it' s not here?
What if some local farmer decides to slash and burn the entire basin?
Instead of the fountain of youth, we' il have a giant rice paddy.
This is our only chance.
You know it is.
Do you wanna give in when we' re this close?
Look.
You know I got your back, right?
We' ve been in the trenches a hundred times together.
- But I' m not going in that jungle.
- Damn straight, man.
Thank you.
This is my expedition, and we' re going to the orchid.
No.
We' re not.
Don' t be an idiot, Sam.
This is bigger than penicillin, for God' s sake.
Lives will be saved by this drug.
People will live longer.
They' il stay young longer.
If we don' t put this to human trials, it' il be a crime against humanity.
Two people have died already.
Scientists have always risked their lives to change the world.
If they didn' t, we wouldn' t have cures for yellow fever, polio and smallpox.
- We all knew the risks.
- We thought we did.
Until you decided to start making decisions behind our backs.
- What are you talking about?
- He offered Bill an extra 50 grand...... to keep going, even though he knew it wasn' t safe.
Oh, my God.
Is that true, Jack?
- I was thinking of the expedition.
- You were thinking of your career.
Look.
You' re my assistant.
I don' t need to consult you!
I' m the one with the authority here.
We' re in the middle of the jungle, Jack.
At this point, your authority is what we say it is.
Guess you got a mutiny on your hands.
Thank you.
Keep it high.
Careful.
Center it right here.
All right.
What are you doing?
Never seen a man shave before?
Probably a lot sharper before you attacked that alligator.
Crocodile.
What' s that mean?
It' s Korean.
I got it when I was in the military.
What brought you here?
- Long story.
- Where am I gonna go?
All right.
Here' s the deal.
I was in the Special Forces...... and I saw and did things...... that I wanted to forget.
Sometimes we do the wrong things for the right reasons, you know?
It' s not very long, as stories go.
Yeah.
Well, I got out of the military...... came here and bought the Bloody Mary.
Just wanted to start a new life.
Thank you, Jack.
On three.
Ready?
One, two, three.
It works.
All right.
Let me explain.
Why in the hell didn' t you tell me about this?
The minute someone makes a call...... this expedition' s over.
Exactly.
All I' m asking for is a few more hours.
We continue on the Mendranang...... take our orchid samples, then we call for help.
Forget about it, Jack.
I' m getting us out of here.
Think about this, Gordon.
You' re about to become a billionaire.
Do you really want to give all that up?
I don' t care about the money, all right?
I wanna live.
It bit me.
Jack, what are you...?
What are you...?
Help.
Help.
Help me.
Where' s Mitchell?
Resting his feet.
- Should I go get him?
- No, no.
- Let him rest till we get loaded.
- Okay.
Those blisters are pretty nasty.
Mitchell...... you okay?
Mitchell?
What is it?
Tell me.
What did you do to him, Jack?
- What is it?
- Something' s wrong with Mitchell.
- What are you talking about?
- You were alone with him.
What did you do?
He was resting his feet.
I didn' t do anything.
- Shit.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Gail, no!
Let' s go!
Get out!
Get out!
Come on!
Come on!
Move!
Move!
Go!
The raft!
No!
You son of a bitch!
We can build another one.
With what?!
With what, Sam?!
We gotta get to the raft.
- It' s our only way out of here.
- FYl, Bill, the raft is gone!
- We can get it back.
- How?!
How?
We gonna swim after it now?
Look...... the village is here.
Jack is following the Mendranang.
We cut across the jungle.
- We can catch him on the other side.
- Right.
- Catch him where?
- He' s going to that orchid.
We find that flower...... we find that raft.
It' s Jack Byron.
Listen, something terrible has happened.
We took the wrong way on the Mendranang.
We went over a waterfall.
I haven' t seen anyone since.
I am....
I think I' m the only one left.
Wait, wait.
Listen.
Oh, shit.
Come on!
It' s in front of us.
Son of a bitch.
It' s trying to separate us.
Oh, shit.
- Oh, Christ, it' s everywhere.
- Turn that goddamn thing off.
- They can see it.
- Doesn' t matter.
- They can sense our body heat.
- He' s right.
Let' s just get the hell out of here.
- Which way?
- Hold on.
Any way.
- Let' s go, Cole!
- Okay, okay!
- Wait for me!
- Come on!
Hold on, wait for me!
Oh, my God.
If there' s a way in, there' s a way out.
Oh, shit!
- Guys?!
- Cole!
Which way?!
Over here!
- All right, say it again!
Say it again!
- Cole!
Over here!
Over here, Cole!
- Hello!
- This way, Cole!
- Guys!
- Cole!
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
God, come on!
Cole!
Oh, no, no!
Stay together.
Okay.
I promise.
Now can we please go?
- Let' s go.
- No problem.
Okay, okay.
Which way?
- I don' t know.
- What?
What do you mean, you don' t know?
I found you, didn' t l?
Tran?
Tran!
Tran!
Say something!
Oh, shit!
Guys!
Guys!
I can see light.
- ls there a way out?
- I don' t know.
Cole!
Tran!
Can you hear me?
Cole!
Where are you?
I think I found a way out.
Take this.
Go.
Now.
- Where are they?
Oh, my God.
Go.
- Help!
- Cole?
- Cole?
- Hey, right here!
Almost there.
Holy shit!
Move!
It' s coming up my ass!
Help me!
What did I do?!
Where' s Cole?
- Cole, come on!
Come on!
- Give me your hand.
- Oh, God!
I' m stuck!
- Give me your -- - I' m stuck!
Pull me!
- Give me your arm!
- Hurry up!
Come on!
Oh, my God!
It' s coming!
Let' s go!
Pull!
Pull!
That' s what I' m talking about, Sam!
Oh, my God!
You' re the bomb, Sam!
You Lorena Bobbitt- ed that ass!
How you like her now, bitch?!
She sliced you, diced you, cut you up!
Sam with the samurai action!
Hell, no.
Cole!
Get up, Cole.
Get up, man.
Wake up, man.
Come on, man.
Wake up.
No, no, no.
Cole.
He' s not breathing!
- He' s got a pulse.
- Give him air!
Okay.
Again, again!
Come on, wake up!
Don' t you die!
Don' t die.
Come on, no.
What the fuck?!
Get it off me!
- No, no.
It' s okay!
It' s okay!
- Hey, it' s okay.
It' s me.
Stay down.
- You' re okay.
- I' m okay?
- Yeah.
- You' re okay.
Perrinia immortalis.
- Yeah.
He can have them.
All I care about is that raft.
Let' s go.
Oh, my God.
Thank God.
I think I know what happened to Mitchell.
I can' t let you take that.
You guys look like hell.
- You don' t know what hell is.
- Oh, I' m sorry.
- But you gave me no choice.
- Did you give Mitchell one...
-... before you killed him?
- I didn' t kill Mitchell.
No...... you just let him die.
I saw the spider bite on his arm.
What was I supposed to do, Sam?
- The right thing?
- It' s always a good place to start.
Let' s not be stupid about this.
Let' s get to the flower, we can all go home.
The mating ball.
Give me the flare.
Tie him up.
Now!
- Fill it up.
- You' ve gotta be kidding me.
Do I look like I' m kidding?!
Fill it up!
Get up!
- Now get the flowers.
- Okay.
Throw me the pack.
Drop the gun!
Throw me the pack.
Get up, Bill!
Get up!
Come on, man!
Get up!
Get up!
- Sam, come on!
- Sam!
Come on!
- Come on, girl!
Hurry up!
- Come on!
- Sam!
Come on!
- Come on!
Hurry up, Sam!
- Come on, baby!
- You got it, honey, come on!
Shit!
- Come on, baby.
- You got it!
- You got it, honey!
- Almost there!
Come on!
- Spider....
- Reach for me!
Come on, Sam, please!
Just reach!
Reach!
Give me your hand.
- Come on!
- Right here, Sam!
Right here!
No!
No!
Oh, God!
Come on, Sam!
Come on!
- Keep coming!
- Come on!
Climb up that wall, Sam!
Keep coming.
Come on, girl!
- Come on!
- Come on.
I got you!
Come on, Sam, get back!
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!
Hey!
Over here, bitch!
Holy shit.
Nice shot.
What can I say?
I' m a bad man.
You two look like you made up.
He' s not so bad.
How' s that?
Much better.
I think I' il live.
Good.
It' s kind of nice having you around.
- So how much further to my bath?
- Kotabaru?
I' d say...
-... another day downriver.
- Another day?
- I' m not rowing another day, homeboy.
- All right.
Let' s see, we got this shortcut right up --
No!

- Welcome home - How do you like it?
Lt' s all the rage in Kingsbury
Amazing
It suits you
Don t you think it s wonderful?
Sophie!
Mrs. Hatter, Sophie hasn t come down to work yet
I wonder what' s the ma tter?
Dor t come in
I ve got an awful cold
I don t want you to ca tch it
You sound just awful...
Like some 90 year- old woman
I' il stay in bed today
You sure?
All right, then
Here we go...
You' il be fine, old lady
You 're still healthy, and these clothes finally suit you
But I car t stay here
It' s not easy being old
They 're saying this war is going to be terrible...
Like a hand, granny?
Such a gentleman, but I' il manage
Sure, old lady, but where are you of f to?
Just a bit farther than where you 're going
I dor t recommend it, granny
Nothing but witches and wizards ahead
Thank you
Going to the Folding Valley, at this hour?
Says her youngest sister' s there
I ve hardly made any progress a t all
Thank goodness I' ve still got my teeth
That II make a good cane
Up we go
Might be a bit too thick
Ouch, ouch
Wha t a stubborn branch
Never underestima te Grandma Sophie
A scarecrow, eh?
I thought you were working f or the Witch
But how do you stand by yourself?
Your head' s a turnip
I' ve always hated turnips
At least you 're not upside down anymore
So long
It' s so cold
The towr s still so close
Dor t follow me You don t owe me a thing
You must be a magical whatever- you- are
I ve had enough of witches and spells!
Just go stand wherever you like!
This is a perf ect cane Thank you kindly
While you 're a t it, could you bring me a house to sleep in?
Seems you get more cunning with age
What a huge battleship
I never realized how weak you f eel when you get old
I smell smoke Maybe there s a cabin
Turnip- head, isr t that Howl s Castle?
This is hardly wha t I meant when I asked for shelter!
Wha t is this?
You call this a castle?
Is tha t the way in?
Just wait up there
Are you going to let me on, or not!
My shawl!
It seems warm enough inside, Turnip I' m going in
Thank you
Even Howl wouldn t want an ancient heart like mine
This time, it' s really goodbye
You may be a turnip, but you 're a good turnip
May you find happiness
Wha t is this place?
Just looks like a dilapida ted heap
Well, one nice thing about getting old is that nothing surprises you anymore
That s some spell you re under
It won t be easy to break
The fire talked
And you car t even tell anyone about it
You re Howl?
I' m the fire demon, Calcif er!
Well, then, Calcif er, can you break the spell I m under?
Easy
I' il break your spell in a flash
In other words, bargain with a demon
You sure you can keep that promise?
Demons dor t make promises
I suggest you look elsewhere
But I' m an exploited demon
I' m chained here by a contract with Howl, who works me to death
I m the one who keeps this castle moving
My, you' ve got it rough
If you figure out the secret contract, the spell will break
If you do tha t, I II break your spell, too
All right A bargain, eh?
Granny
I ve got my doubts about her
Hey, who' s this?
Porthaven!
When did she get in?
Stand by
Why, Mayor, sir
The sun is already high Is Master Jenkins a t home?
The Master is out
I answer in his stead
An invita tion from His Majesty
It has come to war
His Majesty desires every wizard and magician, even the witches, to aid our homeland
His presence is impera tive Tha t is all
War, how awful
And who might you be?
Calcif er let me in
Don t look at me She wandered in from the Wastes
The Wastes?
That' s strange You 're not a witch, are you?
A witch could never get in
Porthaven, again
A customer?
Stand by
State your purpose
Mama sent me
The usual spell?
Behave yourself, now
It s not the Wastes
Granny, are you a witch, too?
That' s right, I' m the scariest witch in the land
Sprinkle this powder on your ship and the winds will f avor it
Sure
Many thanks
I car t have you making up things
You should give up that disguise
It' s not a disguise, it' s magic
The Kingsbury door
Stand by
Is this the residence of Wizard Pendragon?
It is, indeed
I bear an invitation from His Majesty
Please inform Master Pendragon that he is required at the Palace
Our thanks to you
A city fit for a king
Get back in or you' il lose your nose
Stop wandering around
That' s enough!
I m going to get really mad
This is a magic house, isn t it?
Oh, boy!
Where does the black one lead?
Only Master Howl knows
I m having my break f ast
But you ve got bacon and eggs
We car t use the fire when Master Howl s away
I' il cook f or you
But you car t
Calcif er only obeys Master Howl
That s right, I wor t cook f or you
Oh, here' s my hat
All right, Calcif er Be a good fire, now
Forget it, I' m a demon
I answer to no one
You' il do as I say, or I' il pour water on you
Or would you rather I told Howl about our bargain?
Hey!
I never should 've let this old lady in
So, what' il it be?
That' s right, there s a good fire
I' il burn the bacon
Calcif er' s doing wha t she says
I' d like some tea, too Have you got a kettle?
Sure
Welcome home, Master Howl
You have letters from the king
To Jenkins and to Pendragon
Calcif er, you re so obedient
She bullied me
Not an easy thing to do
Who exactly are you?
I' m Grandma Sophie
You see, I m your new cleaning lady
Give me that
Pass me two more bacon slices and six more eggs
And who hired you to clean?
Why, I hired myself
I' ve never seen such a filthy house
Markl, pla tes
You re all ganging up on me
Please join us, Sophie
Sit over here
Pick one
Everything else is dirty
I' ve got my work cut out f or me
Markl
Yes
Sophie
Thank you
Our daily bread
Haver t had a real break f ast in a long while
So many manners to teach...
So, what' s tha t in your pocket?
I wonder wha t it is
Let me
It' s scorched into the table Master Howl, this is...
Ancient sorcery
And powerful, too
The Witch of the Waste?
"He who catches a f alling star, oh heartless man"
"Your heart shall be mine..."
Well, so much f or the table
Wow, it' s gone!
The scorch mark has vanished, but not the spell
Brethren, continue your meal
Calcif er, move the castle 100 kilometers
And send hot water to the bath
Not tha t, too!
Do you work f or the Witch of the Waste?
Dor t be stupid!
The witch...
Actually... the witch...
Damn tha t Witch of the Waste Wait til I get my hands on her!
Let me finish eating this
Bugs, you' d better scurry away or I' il sweep you out
Every last one of you, mocking me
There' s a spell I need
Later
A witch rages within
Sophie
Sophie, I' m going out
I II die without some fresh wood
Wha t, wha t are you doing?
I' il fall, I II f all I m in peril
I' m sweeping the ashes
Wor t be a minute
Oh, no Oh, no
I m in danger
Hurry, Sophie
Try not to torment my friend
Master Howl, are you going out?
Markl, tell our cleaning lady not to get too carried away
What' d you do, Sophie?
She abused me
If I die, Howl goes with me
I' m the cleaning lady
It s my job to clean
No, not the 2nd floor!
If I were you, I' d put your precious things away in a hurry
Save my room f or la ter
My little outburst gave me back my strength
Wha t a strange house
Amazing!
Calcif er, Calcif er!
Are you moving the castle?
What a lot of fuss!
Of course I am
You re incredible, Calcif er
Your magic s first class I misjudged you completely
You think so?
You really think so!
Oh, no, not yet!
How beautiful
It' s called Star Lake
Something s stuck in there
Oh, dear Lend me a hand, Markl
Sure
And up!
A scarecrow
He s called Turnip, the Turnip- head
You sure like being upside down
The odd creature seems to have taken a liking to me
He followed me here
Are you sure you re not a witch, Sophie?
That' s right, I m the cleanest witch in the land
Turnip, dor t pull it so tight
Seems like he likes doing the wash
They II dry in no time
Turnip must belong to the demons
Calcif er doesn t seem to mind him
You 're right, maybe he s a demon of the dead
But he led me to this wonderful place
I' ve put away all the laundry, Sophie
Why, thank you We d better be getting back
I' ve never felt such peace
Stinks
You reek of burnt flesh and steel
Keep flying and one day you wor t be able to change yourself back
Isr t it grea t!
Sophie did this f or me
The fighting is fierce
The country s ablaze, from the southern coast to the northern border
I ha te the fire in gunpowder
They have no manners
My own kind a ttacked me
The Witch of the Waste?
Hack wizards masquerading as monsters
They' il cry plenty later on, when they can t regain human f orm
No, they' il just forget they ever knew how to cry
Arer t you supposed to report to the king yourself?
Yes, well...
Hot wa ter f or my ba th
Oh, no, not again
Is that Howl?
Yeah, wasting my hot water again
I m sure Howl won t eat any breakfast
No ma tter
Morning

Such beautiful, sparkling water
Same as it always is
I myself hate pota toes
Pay up
Thank you
Thanks
Fish, all fresh off the boa t
Tha t one' s tasty
I myself hate fish
The fleet' s come home
There' s been another battle
Really?
Sorry, lady, la ter
Sophie, let' s go get a closer look
No, I' ve no stomach for such things Let' s go home
Our most advanced ba ttleship, reduced to this
Markl, there are Blob Men nearby
Dor t move
They work f or the Witch of the Waste
Dor t people notice those terrible monsters?
That s wha t dropped those bombs!
An enemy airship, Sophie
Sophie, flyers
Ignore the flyers They re enemy propaganda!

If for a boy he is shameful, for a girl he would be depressing.
I will not go single, because créanlo or no, somebody invited to me.
- and I said yes to him that.
Women.
- Then that I create.
Sight, is necessary to give value us and of doing it.
When we go to the room in pair.

- In agreement.

- Cho Chang.
He is slippery.
Thanks.
Cho!
- If '?
- Ehm...
It wanted to know if you would like to go to the dance with me.
I feel it, I did not understand to you.
What I said was that it wanted to know if you would like to go to the dance with me.
Harry, pardon but another boy invited to me.
And...... because I accepted to go with him.
I understand to you.
Well, there is no problem.
Good bye.
Harry!
In truth, I feel it.
It does not pass anything.
It is well.
I pass what to you '?
- That '?
- What said to you?
- That no, of course. - it said yes to You that - you are not idiot.
It was walking...... with which I like to see walk it.
And I could not avoid to ask to him.
In fact, you shouted it, and he was a little frightful. - and soon what you did?
Salíhuyendo.
- I am not done for that.
- Ahíestá.
- I do not know what happened to me.
- Hello, Harry.
Only I like to watch it.
Never.
Hear.
Curse.
Curse.
Why to my '?
- What you have put yourself?
- My suit in full dress, so that '?
Because it shines brilliant.
Without embroiders nor ridiculous sleeves.
Traditional?
He is archaic.
I shine like my tia Tessy.
And I stink out like my tia Tessy.
Mátame, Harry.
It already leaves that moño peacefully.
Good looking to that he is single in its room crying.
- Who?
- Hermione.
Piénsalo.
Why not us it said with whom it would come?
Because nobody invited it.
I had invited it if it was not so proud.
Hello, boys.
Lights very...... elegant.
Ah, aquíestás, Potter.
They are already ready?
- Ready so that '? - to dance.
It is the tradition that the 3 champions, in this case 4, they open the dance.
- No.
- Then already you know it.
And you, Mr. Weasley, it happens to the Great Dining room with the Srta.
- Ahíestán.
- Ahead.
Happen this way.
- Aquíestá.
I need please that they put attention.
It arrives late, Mr. Krum.
All come, this way.
- Yes, I know it.
It is Hermione.
And Viktor.
No.
Of course that no.
It holds my waist.
- Now.
He is pelón odioso, no?
Now we know why it goes as much to the library.
- We will be able to dance?
- To dance, to run, to fly if you want.
It is warm, no?
Víctor was by ponche.
They want to come with us?
No, we do not want to go with you.
What is what it happens to you, Rum?
Fraternizas with the enemy.
The enemy?
Who is the one that wanted its autograph?
In addition, the intention of Match is the cooperation...... international magician.
In order to make friends.
I believe that he tries more than a friendship.
You want that we dance or no?
No.
He is using to you.
How it happens oneself to you?
I doubt it.
It is greater than you.
That '?
That is what you create?
- Yes, that I create.
- Then now already you know the solution.
Which is?
In the next dance they ten the value of to invite to me before another one does it. - and not like your last resource.
- But if...
If not even we were speaking of that.
Harry.
- Where you were?
- It was...
It does not matter.
Already váyanse to the bed both.
They become odiosas with the age. - they always spoil everything.
- What happens to you?
You already know it.
I want to have it.
Ah, if '...
The hour comes near.
Harry... finally.
You have changed, ColaGusano...... so that you salute like it is due to our guest.
Harry, you are well?
I finish arriving.
You can believe it?
Harry, you said to me that you would decipher the key and you would know the answer. - and the test will be in two days.
- In serious?
Then I do not know it.
I suppose that Víctor already deciphered it.
I do not know it, we did not speak of that.
Neither of that, nor of nothing.
To Víctor it likes plus the physicist.
I talk about to that he is not very expressive.
One goes seeing me study.
In fact, he is very tedious.
Síestás trying to decipher it, certain?
- What means that?
- It means that this is designed...... for probarte of the cruelest way.
And...
I fear for you.
You faced dragoon with much value.
Perhaps but it is not sufficient this time, Harry.
Hello, Potter.
It hopes, Cedric.
How... cómo. estás?
Very well.
Listening, I believe that I was not thankful to you by to have warned to me of the dragoons.
Nor it mentions.
You had fact the same by me.
Exact.
You know the bath perfect of the fifth floor?
It is not bad place to take a bath.
It takes your egg and...... everything with hot water meditates.
I must be very crazy.
In truth, I am very crazy.
If I were you, she would put it in the water.
Myrtle!
Hello, Harry.
How long without verte...
I was taking a walk by a pipe obstructed the other day and...... it could swear that I saw little of potion multi- juice. - you behave badly again, Harry?

It was what did...... the other boy.

There are submarine creatures in the Black, certain Lake?
Fantastic.
Cedric took hours in understanding it.
The bubbles of the water almost finished.
Oh, Harry...
Repítelo.
Where our voices, they sound, see look for to us.
The Black Lake, is obvious.
And to find you have it one hour.
Also it is obvious, and a the very problematic time.
Very problematic?
When it was the last time that you held the breathing under the water by 1 hour?
It listens, Harry.
There is a solution, we will find it together.
Moan to interrupt...... but professor McGonagall she wants to see them in his office.
To you no, Potter, only to Weasley and Granger.
But he is that... professor, second test is only in hours...
Exact.
Go.
Now!

You are not safe?
It is that the herbolarios differ from its fresh and salty water effects. - and the truth I do not know that '...
- and me you say it now? - you are joking? - it only wanted ayudarte.
You were of more aid than Ronny.
And where they will be?
You see yourself very nervous, Harry.
You create?
.. they count on one hour to do it.
Only one hour!
Later they will be single, and no magic will save them.
The test will begin to the sonar the tube.
- I do not know it.
I do not see it.
Oh, by God!

Hello, father.
You are not my son.
The curiosity is not a sin.
But you must be cautious.
It is a pensadero? very useful if like I...... you have much information in the mind.
It allows me to examine things of the past.
But I have been treating to find something...... a small detail...... something that perhaps omiti.
Something that explains why these terrible things are happening.
But whenever I want to find it...... one becomes to me to escape.
He is frustrating.
Sir?
To Barty Crouch Junior...
- What was what him step '? - they sent It to Azkaban.
That to Barty destroyed it.
But it did not have option, it demonstrates was forceful.
Why questions?
I dreamed about Barty.
It was in the summer, before to return to the school.
In the dream, I was in a house...... and Voldemort was there.
But... it did not seem human.
And also it was ColaGusano and Barty Junior.
It has happened other times?
Yes, and always it is the same dream.
Sir, those dreams... what I see.
In fact they are not happening, right?.
I believe that you would not have to think in those dreams, Harry.
The best thing is than simply...
... you eliminate them.
Potter!
Why as much haste?
He was inspirador what did in the test.
It used branqui- seaweed?
Yes, Sir.
lngenioso.
The branqui- seaweed is quite rare.
A plant difficult to find.
lgual that this.
It knows what is?
Bubbles, quiza '?
Potion of the truth.
A little and you know who he would reveal his darker secrets.
Used in a student this'...... lamentably prohibited, but...... if he returns to rob something to me of here he can that appears a little...... in its juice of pumpkin.
- I have not robbed anything. - it does not try to deceive to me.
The branqui- seaweed is inoffensive, but serpent skin...... herbórea African.
I will find out why.
Today in the morning...... professor Moody placed the Glass of the Three Magicians in the labyrinth.
Only he knows his exact position.
And aquíel Mr. Diggory.
And Mr. Potter.
It is hour of the first position, they will be first in beginning.
Followed by Mr. Kruf.
And the Srta.
Delacour.
First that touches the Glass...... he will be the winner.
The professors will review the perimeter.
If a champion wishes to retire before finishing...... he only must send red sparks with its varita.
Champions, acérquense.
Express.
In the labyrinth, it will not have dragoons nor creatures you vitiate.
Ahíenfrentarán something much more challenging.
The people, being there inside they become.
If they can, they look for the Glass, but they are cautious...... or they could lose the reason in the passage.
Champions, prepárense.
Son, luck.
- Cuídate.
- You I thank for it, papa.
To the account of three:
One...
Fleur?
Fleur?

It is enchanted.
Yes.
Harry!

ColaGusano, my varita.
- Master.
Thanks.
The other arm.
Welcome, friends.
As if everything had been yesterday.
The truth, I feel very...... disappointed.
No tried to find me.
Not even your '...
Lucius.
My Lord, if there were detected a signal...
-... or it crushes of his whereabouts...
- It had signals, my evasive friend. - and more than one it crushes.
- I assure to Him, my Lord...... that I never have resigned to the Tenebrous Magic.
This face, that I have been myself forced to show from its absence...... it is my true mask.
I sílo helped.
Only by fear.
Not by truth.
But now if '...... me you have been useful last ColaGusano months.
Thanks, master.
Thanks.
- Era a good looking boy. - it does not touch it!
Harry!
Nearly, forgetfulness that you were ahi '...... stopped on the bones of my father.
Yes, it would present/ display to you...... but I know that lately already you are almost as famous as I.
The boy who survived.
What great lie is your legend, Harry.
You want that it gives him what it spent that night 13 years ago?
You want that it discloses how perdíen reality my powers?
Yes, I must do it.
It was the love.
They will see, when the dear Lily Potter it gave its life by its only son...... it provided the Maxima to him protection.
I could not touch it.
It was old magic...... to debísaber it.
But it does not matter, does not matter.
The things have changed.
Now I can...... tocarte.
It is surprising what can to do a little of your blood.
Tomala, Potter.
Tómala, tómala!
They have given flight classes you, yes.
First, a reverence, please.
The courtesy is very important.
To Dumbledore it would not like that you forgot your modales.
I said: reverence.
That is better.
And now...... this.
Very well, Harry.
Your parents would be very proud.
Coverall your despicable mother.
I go to matarte, Harry Potter.
- No.
From today, nobody it will never return to question...... my powers.
As of today, if they speak of you they will speak only of how me suplicaste...... to die.
I pleased to you.
Levántate!
You do not return to give the back me!
I want that you watch to me when it kills to you!
And I want to see when light escapes of your eyes!
As you want.
I myself I will end him.
Harry...... when the connection is broken, you must run towards the traslador.
But only for a moment, you understood?
Harry, llévalo to my body, please.
And llévaselo to my father.
Suéltala, you are ready.
Suéltala!
No!
We did it!
Harry!
No!
- By God, they have returned?
What happens? - it has returned.
It has returned.
Voldemort has returned.
Cedric requested to me that it brought his body.
Not there.
Calm, Harry.
He already happened.
He is here.
- That remains in their seats. - the boy is dead.
- We must retire the body of here.
There is much people.
Déjenme to happen.
Déjenme to happen.
Son.
He is my boy!
He is my son!
- No!
Calm.
They see.
You are with me.
Calm.
Cálmate.
Sécate.
You are well, Potter?
It hurts the wound to you?
Now not much.
Déjame to see it, Harry.
The Glass was a traslador.
Somebody enchanted it.
And it dresses... -... how it was?
- Who?
Mr. Tenebroso.
What in front of feels when being him?
I do not know it.
It was like living one on my dreams.
One of my nightmares.
There were others?
- I...
I not...
I have not said anything on a cemetery.
Wonderful creatures they are those dragoons.
Think that that miserable one had to you noticed if I had not been suggested it?
Think that Cedric Diggory would have said to you...... that you opened the egg in the water if I had not been insinuated it?
Think that Neville Longbottom you it would have mentioned the braqui- seaweed...... if I did not have to him given the suitable book?
Then you were...... who put my name in the Fire Chalice...... and he enchanted to Krum, but...
But, but, but...
You won because me I proposed it.
You finished in the cemetery because asíestaba glided.
And the objective was obtained.
The blood that runs by these veins...... also it runs in those of him.
lmagina how it compensated to me '...... when it knows...... that once and for all...... destruíal great Harry Potter.
Bébela!
You know who I am?
- Albus Dumbledore.
- Alastor Moody. - you are It?
- No.
He is aqui '?
In this quarter?
Harry, aléjate of there.
- You are well, Alastor?
- I feel It, Albus.
It is Moody, but who is...
Potion multi- juice.
Now we know who it has to you been robbing.
It waits a little while.
Barty Crouch Junior.
I will teach mine to you, if you teach yours to me.
You are it...
You know what means, certain?
Your grandfathers.
Lord Voldemort has returned.
I could not avoid it.
Notify Azkaban...... that we found its prisoner.
They will receive to me just as to a hero.
Talvez, but I no I have time for heroes.
Today we felt...... a terrible loss.
633 01: 07: 14, 302 -- > 01: 07: 16, 311 lnfinitamente honest.
A faithful... faithful friend.
Therefore I believe that they have right to knowing how it died.
Yes.
... to Cedric Diggory I kill it '......
The magic minister no he wanted that one said them.
But not to do it I consider it an insult to its memory.
The intense pain...... which we felt before this loss, it remembers to me, remembers to us...... that although we come from different places and we spoke different languages...... our hearts bark as if they were one only.
Dices these events...... the friendship bows that we have formed east year...... they will be more important that never.
Remember this...... and Cedric Diggory it will not have died in vain.
Brave and faithful even the last moment.
I never liked these curtains.
When it was in 4 year I burned them.... by accident, clear.
I put to you in a great one east danger year, Harry.
I feel it.
Professor.
When he was in cemetery, had a little while...... in that the varita of Voldemort and mine because they were connected.
It dresses to your parents that night, certain?
They reappeared.
- Yes.
I believe that you know it.
Difficult times and dark they wait to us.
Soon we will have to choose between which he is correct...... and what is easy.
But this remembers:
Aquítienes friends.
You are not single.
Hermione...... this is for you.
Escríbeme, please.
Good bye.
Think that sometimes we will have a calm year in Hogwarts?
- No.
- No.
No, hopefully no.
Because... what would be the life without dragoons?
Everything will change now, no?
Yes.
Promise that they will write to me.
Please.
I no.
You know that I do not write.
- Harry, you will do it?
- Yes, every week.
Previously on Prison Break.
We' re through the hard part.
Another 18 inches, we' il hit that pipe.
We' il be there by Friday.
Now we got a hell of a lot to talk about, don' t we?
This guy says he' s on the job in here.
Concrete is my specialty.
Okay, boss, sign him up.
Whites don' t want you, blacks don' t want you.
You' re just caught in the middle, aren' t you?
A regular 'tweener.
- Hello.
- It' s me.
- It' s time.
- Yes.
Why are you so cynical?
Michael, I think there' s cynicism and then there' s realism.
There' s optimism, hope, faith.
Thank you for trying to make me smile -- not today.
You never know.
You want the Cooper story?
I can' t give it to you, 'cause I' m not him.
The lawyers you tried to blow up, they' re still running around.
Same thing goes with the kid.
You got to hand the reins over to me, now.
Ow!
You and your partner are off the job until further notice.
That one.
- Nice choice.
- Thanks.
Platinum.
Brushed.
- Six point two five?
- Six point two five.
She' s a lucky woman.
She is.
You kept it.
Kept what?
The flower.
I' m a pack rat, I never throw anything out.
Yeah, all this clutter, it' s, uh... overwhelming.
You should see my apartment.
Haven' t even had our first date yet, and already you' re inviting me in.
Thought you were a nice girl.
Oh, Michael, we all know nice girls finish last.
So where do you finish?
That depends on where I start.
Deep breath.
Exhale.
Inhale.
Sara, we' re backing up out here.
I' m sorry.
I' m going to get your shot.
This is not what I signed on for.
What do you want us to do?
Want us to wave the white flag?
Call a time out?
I just want to get Lincoln off death row.
Lincoln?
We just learned that Vice President Reynolds funneled millions of dollars in research grants into her brother' s company.
That money was filtered into millions of small accounts, that made millions of small donations to her campaign, setting her up to be the next leader of the free world.
This doesn' t end with us stopping an execution anymore.
For me, it does.
Let' s rotate.
Sergeant Sodomy, you' re up next.
Yo.
Come on.
I don' t know about you all, but, uh... this room is getting a little too dark for me to dig.
You telling me that there' s a hole in Fox River that you don' t want to get into?
What?
Hey, no one gets hurt.
You know, I got a question.
How come Fusilli over here ain' t grabbing a shovel?
I' m handling arrangements on the outside.
Really?
So what is that transpo?
Paper?
Exactly.
That makes me management.
And that makes us just labor.
Mm- hmm.
Now you' re getting it.
You know, management better keep a close eye on the conditions up in here.
Or the labor' s liable to go on strike.
You feel me?
Get back to work.
Whoa, whoa.
CO' s coming.
Put that back up there.
Scofield.
Move it.
It' s time for your conjugal.
Your wife is here.
So you' re Mrs. Scofield.
You ever done this before?
Had a conjugal, I mean.
No.
Don' t worry, I' m just trying to make conversation.
Clear.
She look familiar to you?
No, Captain.
I know her from somewhere.
You came.
Of course.
How have you been?
Fine.
I found a job.
I' m glad.
Is it awful being here?
That hotel by the airport?
Only difference is $69 and the free shampoo.
Always the brave face.
You' re still wearing it.
Every day.
I worry about you.
Don' t.
Is there anything else that I can do?
Just what we agreed on.
I was so nervous when they were checking.
One question.
Why would you need a credit card in prison?
See, I don' t think the riot changed anything.
Have you seen the latest budget cuts for this place?
Another ten percent from health care.
35% from prevention.
He might be the governor, but he' s also your father.
Maybe he thinks if he cuts enough they can' t afford you.
You understand this is standard procedure following a conjugal, Scofield?
Never can be too careful.
All right, bend over.
You have a good time in the romper room with that Euro?
Whatever you say, boss.
She come around here before?
- First time.
- You sure?
'Cause damn if I don' t recognize her from somewhere.
Maybe she visits some other con.
Killing two birds with one bone.
- Catching my drift?
- I wouldn' t know.
He' s clear, Captain.
Make sure you take a shower, Scofield.
You never know what some women can give you.
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low
You know this one, don' t you?
Coming for to carry me home.
Come on, give me something.
I thought you was the musical people.
You know, parents must be so proud of you, man.
I mean, hitting the trailer park trifecta.
Racist... pedophile, and stupid.
You know, it vexes me that... that I' m made out to be the bad guy in the room.
It' s not like y' all are incarcerated for stealing Girl Scout cookies.
None of us murdered any Girl Scouts in the process.
Michael' s coming back from the bone yard.
Alone... alone.
I tell you everything about me and Maricruz, and you can' t even tell me you' re married?
Later.
Rough day, huh, Scofield?
While the rest of us are in here slinging concrete, you got some little girl to play on your rusty trombone, huh?
The man' s got a point.
You know what I' m saying?
Shut up and dig, T- Bag.
I think what the idiots inside here wants to know is... while we' re digging this hole... what are you doing?
I' m going shopping.
We' re good.
All clear.
A credit card?
The bulls catch you with that, they' il be so far up your doggy door, you' il...
Don' t worry.
They won' t be catching me with one.
- Because...
I don' t have a credit card.
Nick?
Help!
Please!
I had an accident... my car... is totaled.
I just need... please... is anyone in there?
We can' t just ignore him.
The hell we can' t.
Please!
Help me, please!
Oh, God.
What happened?
I must have dozed off.
I was driving for 12 hours.
Should I get some water from the well?
- The well' s dried up.
- Oh, God, my leg.
I think there' s a medical kit over here.
No one' s going anywhere.
All right.
Say good- bye to junior.
No!
You know how many pints of blood the human body has?
The answer is ten.
Ten pints.
How many do you think Prince Charming over there on the floor has left?
Eight?
Going on seven?
Tell you what -- I' m gonna take him out to the woodshed, have a little talk.
In the meantime, I want you to chew on this.
You tell me everything that you have discovered about the Burrows case, and who else you' ve told about it, and there' s a chance that I might let you go in time to get Mr. Savrinn to a doctor.
You decide whose life is more valuable -- the guy waiting to die on death row or the guy wishing he' d die out in the woodshed.
One suit, black.
One pair of socks, black.
One pair of shoes.
Shoelaces.
One small tape recorder.
One gold watch.
You ever stay at a fancy hotel, LJ?
You know, you leave your room in the morning, it' s a mess.
last night' s room service stinking to high heaven.
But then, when you come back at night, it' s all gone.
Fresh towels, clean sheets, candy on the pillow.
It' s just the best feeling in the whole world,
'cause someone else cleaned up your mess, all you had to do was walk away.
Don' t you hurt them.
Okay.
But you got to tell me exactly what they know and who else they have told, and nobody has to die tonight.
You just walk away.
Let me clean up your mess.
I don' t know what' s going on.
I swear to God!
I wish I could believe that.
Bellick assigned me a new cell mate.
Who' d you get?
Some new fish.
Ran a bump and swipe on an off- duty cop.
Fast hands, faster mouth.
Yo, what' s crackin ', my peoples?
Speak of the devil.
Michael Scofield.
David Apolskis.
What' s up?
I seen you before, right?
You' re part of that PI crew.
Maybe you could hook me up.
You know, a brother needs to make some green -- some cash- eesh, you know what I' m sayin '?
It pays 19 cents an hour.
19 cents?
That' s slavery, yo.
That' s prison, yo.
And besides, Pl' s all full up for now.
I feel you.
But keep a brother in mind, all right, if something opens up, you know?
Hell, I' il pay 19 cents an hour to get me some more time out the block.
Like having another kid.
Already raised one, I' m too old to do it again.
You ever hear of anything being stolen from R and D?
Of course.
Bulls steal from personals all the time.
The problem is, you never know what' s gone until you' re on the outside of the walls.
At that point, you can' t do anything about it.
What if you knew now?
Look, I told you, leave me out of whatever it is you got going.
I just need to know if you' ve seen a guard with a gold watch.
There' s a lot of people that can get you a gold watch in here.
Yeah, but I need this specific gold watch.
Westmoreland!
Pope wants to see you!
Let' s go!
Look, I haven' t seen nothing.
But there is this one CO -- word is, he' s the worst thief in here.
My wife just faxed this over for you from county records.
Copy of Scofield' s marriage license.
She says you owe her big time.
Looks legit.
He wasn' t trying to sneak in some whore for a conjugal.
Says here, they got married the day before Scofield robbed that bank.
Why the hell would he do that?
- Heard from Veronica?
- No.
You?
Just a note from LJ saying he' s with her, that he was safe.
But, you know, it' s been awhile.
Doesn' t feel right.
Feels wrong.
Really wrong.
I, uh...
I' ve come to a realization.
Either Miss Donovan and that boy don' t like you very much or they have an unreasonable amount of faith in your cardiovascular system.
So tell me, Nick, this all you got?
This paper trail of an indictment that never even happened?
Is this it?
We know you don' t have a surveillance tape anymore.
We know you don' t have anybody to testify.
So is this really all you' ve got?
Mr. Savrinn, that bullet went through your teres major, ripped the lateral margin of your scapula,
So, if you try to swing that piece of lumber at me...... it' s gonna feel like your arm is ripping out of its socket.
Come on, Nick.
Mr. Project Justice.
We both know why you' re really here, don' t we?
And it ain' t to save Lincoln Burrows' life.
Inside these walls, I creep and I crawl, looking for a way out.
But I know it' s gonna be no easy route.
This is gonna be a 12 round... 12 round bout.
With Bellick and T- Bag on my mind...... it' s grindin 'here...
Still interested in getting in on Pl?
Does my mama got big breastices?
I wouldn' t know.
Hell, yeah, she does, and hell, yeah, I do.
All right, look, I need a favor.
Word is, you made your trade as a snatch and grab.
That' s right.
I need you to steal something back that was stolen from me.
What kind of somethin 'we talkin' about?
Just a watch.
Uh- uh, there ain' t no such thing as "just a watch."
Every design has a different clasp, every clasp has a different swipe.
It' s Italian, a Remedi.
Gold band, pearl face, all- weather.
- What year?
- 2003.
There' s a butterfly clasp on that bitch.
- Which means what?
- Hidden deployment.
There ain' t no way to snatch it without the mark feeling it -- which just means I' m gonna have to get whimsical on this ficky.
I get you this watch, that mean I get in on some of that Pl?
It means I' il think about it -- no promises.
Why you need this watch so bad anyway?
Let' s just say it means a lot to someone in my family.
Come in, Charles.
Sit down.
What' s going on?
I' ve got some bad news, Charles.
Your daughter is very sick.
She' s got esophageal cancer.
Now, she' s at Sacred Heart in Indianapolis.
And she wants to see you while there' s still time.
How much time?
Doctors say a few weeks.
The problem is, the D. O. C. is not gonna let you go.
They think you' re still a flight risk.
- She' s my only child.
- I know that.
Believe me, Charles, I' ve lobbied on your behalf.
It' s state policy.
They will only extend furloughs in the case of funerals.
I have to wait until she dies before I see her?
Mr. Scofield, looks like I' il be administering your shot today.
Where' s Dr. Tancredi?
We' ve got a busy schedule today.
She' s with another patient.
Hold him down before he jumps off the cart!
Hold his legs!
Hold his legs down!
Hey, we need a doctor here!
What' s happened?
The kid was in chow.
Then all of sudden, he collapsed, and he started spittin 'up his food.
Looks like he' s having some kind of a seizure.
Get him up here, get him up here.
And make sure he doesn' t hurt himself.
I gonna O2 and a cardio...
Hold him, hold him!
So, Ms. Donovan, how is that background in real estate law going for you?
It' s a big help?
Hmm?
You know, frankly, I think we caught a break.
Lincoln had nailed a girl with half a brain, she probably would have brought this whole thing down already.
But you know what the worst part is?
That you dragged these people into this, knowing that you had no clue how to get them out.
I mean, if you had just minded your own business, people like Leticia Barris -- she wouldn' t have a mouthful of maggots right about now.
Your fiancé would not be lying in his apartment waiting for the smell of his rotting corpse to let the neighbors know that something had gone horribly wrong.
That' s right -- their deaths are on your head.
You made this mess.
Nobody else.
You.
But you' re also the one person that can end it all right here.
All I need to know is who else you' ve involved.
So, you just nod, and I' il know you' re ready to talk.
You know, Ms.
Donovan, I think that, uh, you look a little cold.
Maybe you' il find it easier to talk... after you' ve warmed up a little bit.
Where is he?
What happened?
We got to move.
Come on!
Come on, we' re getting out of here.
Where are the keys?
My pocket.
Start the car!
Okay.
Is he gonna be all right?
Go start the car, LJ!
We' re gonna get you to a hospital, all right?
A gift from my cell mate.
Thank you.
And thank him.
The watch -- what' s it for anyway?
Thought you didn' t want to know about any of this.
Things have changed.
I want in.
Why the sudden change of heart?
I have my reasons.
Don' t take this the wrong way, but everyone who' s in is bringing something to the table.
How about money?
- How much we talking about?
- I think you know.
I seem to remember several conversations that ended with, "I am not D. B. Cooper."
- I lied.
- You lied?
We' re cons.
We tend to do that.
I checked your alibi.
According to records, you were incarcerated at the time of the Cooper hijacking.
My father and I share more than just a weakness for easy money.
We also share a name.
Charles Westmoreland, Senior was the one locked up that day.
Now, do you want the money or not?
No offense, but it' s a little convenient.
You want in, and suddenly, you' re the guy.
How do I know you' re not lying right now?
Hey, Old Man River, keep it moving.
I got a question about you and the rest of the Mexicans.
I don' t think I' il be able to help, seeing as I' m Puerto Rican.
Geographical semantics, amigo.
I' m speaking about the general "Latin- o" population.
How is it that a people so historically
lazy ended up being such a big part of the nation' s work force?
The way I see things, it' s everyone else that' s lazy.
Otherwise, there wouldn' t be any jobs for the immigrants.
The ones sitting at home collecting unemployment, the lazy ones -- it' s not us.
You gonna let him talk about your people like that?
Uh, whatever, Deliverance.
We may be a team in here, but just so that you know, the minute we get over that wall, it' s every man for himself.
Or sooner.
LJ?
LJ?
LJ?
Do you know how the Russians do things?
They let you live, and they kill everyone else in your family, and, well, any- anyone you' ve ever loved.
How does that sound?
- Go to hell.
- Oh, come on.
Is that any way for a lady to talk?
Oh.
What, do you think I' m an idiot?
I' m just going to walk into a well?
Seriously, Ms. Donovan.
You all right?
Scofield, no sitting down on the job.
I want you out here working where I can see you.
I' m on it, boss.
Move it, Scofield.
Move it!
Hey, Brad.
Good to see you.
Hey, baby.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for our next lovely young lady.
Up on the main stage, it' s Jasmine.
Would you like a private dance?
Why don' t you sit down and chat for awhile.
See if we hit it off.
- So, what' s your name?
- Brad.
- Yours?
- Jasmine.
Come on... your real name.
- It' s Nika.
- Nika.
Now that' s a pretty name.
Tell me, Nika, how' s your husband feel about you working here?
I' m not married.
I hope you' re lying for the sake of titillation.
Otherwise, your little visit to Fox River this morning would have been breaking the law...
Mrs. Scofield.
We are married.
But they tell all the girls to lie.
It' s better for making business.
I' m not here to get you in trouble.
I just want to know a little more about your husband.
Well, he' s a very good man.
I' m sure he is.
But even good men do bad things.
Your accent.
You' re from -- now, don' t tell me -- Budapest, right?
- Prague.
- Prague...
How recently did you come over?
Only a couple months, I bet.
You like it here in America?
You know, I really have to keep moving.
They don' t like us to spend too much time in one spot.
I just need to know what Michael Scofield wanted from you in exchange for the green card.
Nothing.
We met while he was studying overseas...
I don' t want to know what you memorized for the INS.
Now, either you answer my questions about Scofield, or I call my guy in the Chicago P. D.
And maybe he starts asking some questions about you.
A credit card.
He asked me to bring him a credit card.
That' s it.
Yeah.
Come and get me -- now.
New Glarus, I' m in New Glarus.
No, thanks, I brought my own.
Dorothy Andrews Elston Kabis.
United States Treasurer, 1971.
The year of the D. B. Cooper hijacking.
Dl192589 -- the first number in a series of bills used in the ransom drop.
Thanks for the history lesson.
All it proves is you did the research.
Same as me.
So, you' re married.
Uh, well... not in the traditional sense of the word.
Michael, we' re both adults, put your cards on the table.
Okay, I' il got first.
I' m used to a certain amount of innuendo and flirtation being thrown my way.
I' m not used to enjoying it.
Look, Sara...
It' s "Dr.
Tancredi, "and please let me finish.
I' m not a jealous woman.
But I am a careful one.
Careful.
- You don' t have to be.
- Yes, I do.
There are so many questions surrounding you, Michael.
There are way too many.
From now on, your shots, any medical concerns, they' re all fine, as long as it' s doctor- patient.
But personal questions and favors of any kind, are no longer a part of our relationship.
The questions you have about me... there are answers.
Quinn!
I was getting worried.
You guys get lost?
We tried to call you again to pinpoint your signal, but you never picked up.
Yeah, the battery went dead on the damn cell phone.
What are you going to do, right?
So, uh, how' d it go?
I have a broken leg down here.
Yeah, listen, you know, I think maybe we got off on the wrong foot.
You have bosses, I have bosses. but at the end of the day, we' re all on the same team.
Right?
We' re both just trying to tie up some loose ends.
I could not agree more.
Yeah, so, can you guys get a rope or a ladder, or something?
What the hell is that?
Hey...
Hey!
Just tying up some loose ends.
You stupid son of...
Hey, guys!
Hey!
Hey, don' t do this!
Don' t do this!
Please!
My leg' s broken, I can' t stand!
You have to help me!
You can' t just leave him down there.
He' il die.
He' s the only one who knows we don' t have the Burrows kid.
The only one.
There' s room for you down there too, Danny.
Don' t leave me like this!
Don' t leave me!
Please!
Please!
You coming back to PI today?
It' s getting kind of testy in there, you know?
Yeah.
I just needed to find something out.
What the hell is that?
Listen.
Am I supposed to be hearing something?
Shh.
Just hold on.
- There.
- What?
We sat around here for 20 minutes waiting to hear that?
18 minutes, actually.
And, yes.
- What was it?
- Keys.
The guards' keys.
18 minutes is how long we have between each time the guards pass beneath the infirmary windows on their rounds at night.
Cons aren' t allowed outside after hours.
It was the only way I could find out the timing.
- What does that mean?
Four days from now, on the night of the escape, we' il have 18 minutes to get the bars off the infirmary window, and for all seven of us to get across the wire and over the wall.
- Is that doable?
- Of course.
What' s up?
Nothing.
Hey, I know that look.
What' s up?
I hit it!
We' re there!
Guys, guys.
Come on, Michael, talk to me.
You want the good news or the bad?
The good.
Westmoreland and his money are in.
- What' s the bad?
- I' ve done the math.
It' il take at least 5 minutes for us to get the bars off the window in the infirmary.
And two minutes each for us to get across the wire and over the wall.
So?
We' ve only got 18 minutes.
We' ve got too many people.
One of them has to go.
Synchro:
Travis Transcript:
But why?
It has been 34 years since they arrived in this planet.
Do not live in fear.
I have vowed to the end that fear.
I believe my dreams hold the key.
Will I be in time to save the Earth?
Where are you?
This is a restricted area.
Do not move!
What is she doing here, captain?
I don' t know, but we are getting her out.
You' re coming with us.
Behind you!
Hold it right there!
Damn it!
Let' s move, people.
Two, coming through the wall.
Alright, hold your fire.
Ryan, Neil, let' s go.
What the hell do you think you are doing?
There is a life form in here.
There hasn' t been life here in years.
There is now.
Life form or not, I' m not leaving without that life form.
Gonna be one of those days.
Captain, principal is not going to wait any much longer.
I understand that.
It' s in bad shape.
Tell me when I am risking for this plant.
It' s wheat.
I won' t even call it a wheat.
I need a minute to extract it.
Miss, that' s the minute we do not have.
I' m afraid his right about that, ma' am.
Captain, we have incomings.
Captain, we need to get out from here.
Understood, sergeant.
Could you hurry please, miss?
Done, captain.
Yes, Neil.
Let' s get out from here.
Can I have this please?
Thank you.
Shit!
Just relax.
Everyone, up to top.
Go!
Transport requesting immediately event.
Confirm.
Up here!
We are right behind you.
I got you.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Here they come.
Are you okay?
Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn' t arrest you?
I am Dr. Aki Ross.
I have clearance to be here.
Not unlimited clearance.
And not without authorization.
Captain, I don' t have time for this.
Do you realize you have just risk the lives at my squad and me?
The fact of the matter is, it was worth the lives of you and your men.
You and your men?
She thinks you are a man.
I think she' s an idiot.
I know you are not a man.
I think you' re an idiot too.
Very funny.
But I do want to talk about it.
Did it occur to you that maybe we are not volunteer to risk our lives?
Have we been given a choice?
Nobody asked you to save me.
You have not changed a bit.
Gray?
Yeah, nice to see you too.
Welcome back, captain.
We' re cleaned.
Let' s make sure of this, shall we?
I hate getting scanned.
Sir, the scan probably worth to us than the phantoms.
I' il probably abort it, captain.
This machine are suspected to causing sterility.
And I want to have a little new junior to call me daddy someday.
That' s a spooky thought.
Why are you always busting my chop?
Alright.
- Yes, sir.
Okay, next.
Looks like you gain some weight.
I' m working on it.
You know my security rating allows me to bypass this.
Not today, it doesn' t.
Something' s not right.
About this mission?
- Or that woman?
- Both.
Next.
I think...
I don' t care what you think, doctor.
You' re getting scanned just like everybody else.
Oh shit!
Captain!
They got him.
There must be a mistake.
You came in contact with the phantom, sir.
Please remain calm.
Administering treatment shield.
What level is he?
Blue.
He will be coded at 3 1/ 2 minutes.
We have to treat him now.
I' m sorry.
That' s impossible.
There' s no time for that.
Take him to the table.
Hang on, captain.
Locating particles.
Look at that thing.
How much more time?
Not enough.
When he reaches code red, the treatment shield won' t be able to hold the aliens particles
Engaging bio- ethereal laser.
- What' s going on?
- Where does it go?
What the hell is going on?
We lost contact.
Infer station is moving deeper.
- There is no time.
- There is no time!
You' re gonna lose him.
Founded.
It' s alright.
You' il be back to normal in no time.
Doctor, we need to scan you for in infer station.
That won' t be necessary.
I' il take responsibility.
Thanks for saving him.
Are you alright?
Yeah, but the military has impounded my ship
What' s with her?
And what' s with her with the captain?
What' s with her and the stupid plan?
What?
Forward me the phantom data and everything we got in the file spirits collected so far.
Yes, Doctor.
Spirits?
I thought we are not suppose to use the S word.
Let' s see if the plant does the trick.
It' s a match.
We' ve found it.
Yes, the 6th spirit.
A little scene today brought me every protocol
How long do you think this would have survive outside the barrier?
Aki, you know there are elements in the Council military just waiting for an excuse to shut us down.
1 0 years ago, who discovered the energy and the phantoms?
You.
And who proved the same energy source existed in humans and every life form?
You.
You made the possible to harness that energy for overpacks, scanners, even the barrier.
The Council knows that.
We are so close to proving...
We still need this part and this one here.
Exactly.
Two more pieces and we solve the puzzle.
We need to be free to find these pieces.
I want to show you something, Aki.
- What is this?
- Read.
All life is born of Gaya and each life has a spirit.
Doctor...
Go on.
Through their experiences on Earth, the spirits mature and grows.
Bring in with it the experiences, enabling Gaya to live and grow.
To my old diary.
I wrote that 43 years ago when I was the age you are now.
Dr. Sid!
I don' t know what happen to Gary Will.
They threw him into jail because he said that Earth was not descendant of the universe.
That could happen to us.
Our ideas are unpopular, Aki.
Destroy them.
Keep them up here.
Right.
And stay away from your friend, that captain.
He saves your life, you save his life.
That' s least to that.
I was once young too, you know.
Doctor, there is a war going on.
No one is young anymore.
Could you please explain why Zeus cannon was completed a month ago.
If we attack their media with this, we will eliminate the phantoms at their source.
General Hein, calm down.
To attack alienated media.
We have reconvince today to vote on that very issue again.
Now I would like to ask the director of the bio- ethereal center to speak.
Dr Sid, please.
As you all know, the phantom nested the alienated media that landed here 34 years ago.
What you see now, are the records of assault on the media to date.
Physical attacks here had no affect.
This seems to place 3 months ago joining a full scale of art.
Please note that the phantom outside the media are indeed destroyed.
And as you see over all phantom density remains the same.
By burly, even deeper into the Earth.
Now this is very interesting to me, Dr. Sid.
When using bio- ethereal laser on phantom particles.
- Do we not?
- Yes, indeed we do.
You see the injured escape, burying or digging themselves deeper into the patient body.
And in some cases, death.
And what exactly does that mean, Doctor?
It means there is a very good chance to being from the Zeus cannon built in the phantoms in a media.
Exactly.
Thank you.
However, it also means that the being energy maybe too strong injuring the Earth.
Injure the Earth?
You mean the spirit of the Earth?
The spirit of the Earth.
I need to say what I need to say.
I know what I' m doing.
And whatever you do, keep you mouth shut.
This is ridiculous.
You come here just to talk about some Gaya theory?
Tell us the planet is alive?
Has a spirit?
That' s a fairy tale, Doctor.
Sorry, but we don' t have time for that.
It' s not a fairy tale, it' s true.
I' m not just making a hole on the ground, I am killing the planet.
Dr. Sid, the Gaya theory has not been proven.
We still have to remove the phantoms.
We should take it?
- Don' t you agree?
- Of course I do.
But there is an alternative to this space cannon
Another method?
Yes, I mean of disabling the phantoms.
Please.
we know that the aliens display distinct energy pattern
Now it is a fact that two bio- ethereal waves places one over the other will cancel each other out.
It' s the erectile possible to construct the wave pattern direct opposition to the phantom energy.
We are currently assembling...
- Dr. Sid....
- such a wave in new completion...
Members of the Council, gathering plants and animals from around the world to fight the phantoms is other nonsense.
The Zeus cannon is a proven effective weapon.
It will kill phantoms.
Can we afford to wait for some crazy inventions
An invention with no solid evidence that will destroy the aliens.
There is evidence.
Our partially completed energy wave has a terminally successfully stopped phantom particles from spreading through a terminally infected patient.
Doctor, do you claim to have evidence that terminally patient has been cured.
The wave is not completed.
But we have succeeded in containing the particles safely inside the patient.
Where is the proof?
Here.
But I wonder what caused?
Doctor, I can' t keep hiding in the background while you protect me.
I want what life I have left to mean something.
When we find the 7th and 8th spirits......
If we find them, what we need now is some luck.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
Fate and hard work, girl.
Cause I' il be damn if you die before me.
The Council decided to postpone firing the Zeus cannon.
I guess I put on a good show.
Mind if I take a look?
You' il probably get bored.
So what are you doing?
Oh, I see.
Giving me the silent treatment.
I am scanning the city for the 7th spirit.
Hurry up, Neil.
I almost got it.
What do you think you are doing?
We just gonna strengthen them for a while.
It was his idea.
It' s your idea?
We just help the captain up a little.
You see how the captain looks at her.
It' s a more, baby.
What' s going on?
Probably just a glint.
- Listen, Aki...
- I' m still mad at you.
You are mad at me?
Leaving your helmet on and not telling me who you were?
That doesn' t seem a little childish.
I was just a little upset when you dispatched and leave the Zeus station without saying a word.
Now you know what' s going on, alright?
Now I know.
My operation had to be done in zero graph, okay?
Fine! how about the fact that I was sent there on the job
I was probably helping Dr. Sid collected the spirit wave.
Now I know.
So I' m sorry.
So we are both sorry.
So would you tell me about them?
About what?
About the spirits you collected.
I was infected by the phantom during an experiment.
Normally no one could had survived.
How could you?
Dr. Sid created a memory around the infection
Keeping me alive.
So the first spirit wave was me.
The second was a fish.
A fish?
The third was a deer I found in a wildlife- preserved outside Moscow.
The fourth was a bird.
Ever try to track a sparrow out of space?
It' s no fun.
What am I saying?
You probably would love that.
I probably would.
And then there was that plant I collected from Time Square.
I thought that was number 6.
- What?
- You skipped one.
The fifth was a little girl dying in a hospital emergency room.
I retrieved the disabling time, but she...
I told her everything has a spirit.
Dogs, cats, trees, little girls, even the earth.
I told her that she wasn' t dying, just returning to the Earth spirit.
The Gaya.
She... told me that she was ready to die.
She said I didn' t have to make up stories to make her feel better.
Only 7 years old and ready to die.
I' m sorry.
I have to find the 7th and the 8th spirits.
Don' t... please....
You don' t believe any of this, do you?
I just... don' t know, Aki.
Is this why you shut me out?
You should have told me.
I don' t know how much time I left.
Who does?
I better get back to scanning.
Captain Edwards, you extracted a Dr. Ross from old New York several days ago.
Did you not?
What were you impressions of Dr Ross?
She seems very capable and determines.
You and the Deep Eyes are being temporary reassigned.
You will guard Dr. Ross when she re- enters the waste land.
Understood, sir.
You don' t understand yet, Captain.
Report any ebullient behavior in Dr Ross to the Major immediately.
Ebullient behavior, sir?
The woman carries an alien infer station, captain.
We don' t know what it maybe doing to her.
The aliens presence could be effecting her judgement.
And maybe manipulate the Doctor for their very own purposes
Is the General suggesting that Dr Ross is a spy?
The General is wondering why he explains himself to a captain.
She separated long exposure to phantom tissue
If this begins to manifest itself in anyway,
Dr Ross is to be placed under arrest.
And transport here for observation.
It is in fact for her own good, captain.
Of course, sir.
Major, send some of our man to keep an eye on our good captain.
I' m convinced these dreams are some form of communication.
The message still elude to me.
The phantoms inside me are beginning to win
Our target is to discrete at two sign.
Roger.
Phantom concentration.
Not good.
We got big minutes everywhere.
So it' s gonna be a real picnic.
Stick close to me.
No heroin today, okay?
Everything by the book.
By the book, alright.
If we drop energy here, here and here.
We should be able quiet at the target and get out even before the phantoms know we were there.
And that would attract the phantoms.
For a while.
So you are from the 307s, right?
Under General Hein?
Have you done any wasteland recon before?
And get pretty ugly.
Captain, rendezvous at sector 6 coded 279.
Stellar for hard files.
Looks like they are taking a bath.
The 7th spirit should be just beyond the line.
I don' t see how any living thing could survive out here.
You' il find out soon enough.
This was the phantom cleansing mission.
It was supposed the end of war.
My father is in here somewhere.
Let' s move out, people.
I' il be damn.
A survivor.
What is it doing out here?
Hoping for life to return.
- Is that our spirit, Doc?
- No.
We' ve closing in on a life form.
Distance?
Hard to say.
We are very close.
I don' t see anything.
You' re not gonna tell me it' s him.
That' s impossible
It' s his overpack.
How do you explain that?
Packs?
Power or weapon?
The barrier cities?
I mean it' s just by with theory energy.
And to create that energy, we use living tissue.
Single cell organism.
You' re telling me his backpack is the 7th spirit.
Yes.
Captain, do you read me?
Once again.
Captain, we have incoming.
Ryan, get the soldier' s pack.
I need a hand, sergeant.
- Those boys.
- Yeah.
Then I' il working.
Thank you.
Are you alright?
Of course I am.
Let' s get the hell out of here.
Something is not right.
It should be happening.
Something are tracking them.
Aki...
Closing fast.
Jane, take the lead.
Fire the hole!
Get us out of here, Neil.
Sir, I would love to.
- But...
- Just do it!
- Sir?
- Locate that seat.
That doesn' t look good, captain.
We have to get her to a hospital.
You have your order, sir.
What the hell is happening here?
Dr Ross is to be taken into the custody now.
That' s an order.
We have no choice but to relief you and your command.
I won' t let you do this, soldier.
You' il gonna have to shoot me.
Bend down, captain!
Aki!
Hang on, everyone!
That' s enough!
Everyone down.
Neil, get us back to New York.
Fast.
The device are returned from the wasteland, sir.
Apparently there was an incident.
It would seem the phantoms were attracted to Dr Ross.
The crew barely escaped with their lives.
Captain Edward is still in command.
Issue an order.
I want Edward and Dr Ross to be place under arrest.
All research materials pretending to Dr Sid wave theory are to be confiscated immediately.
That might not go over too well with the Council, sir.
What a tragedy that would be.
This is perfect, Major.
It' s too good the captain has opened the door for us.
By tomorrow morning, the Council would bear our feet.
To save them from the phantoms.
How is she, Doctor?
She is dying.
There must be something you can do.
We have to implant the 7th directly into her chest plate.
It took a bullet.
I think it might be damage.
We have to appear this panel quickly.
Her vital signs are dropping.
Aki is slipping away from us.
She needs a sympathetic spirit to help her held hold in this world.
And I can think of no spirit but to suit for that task but yours, captain.
I don' t understand.
You just be with her now.
You' il keep her here with us.
Aki, where are we?
On an alien planet.
How is that possible?
I' m not entirely sure.
You seem pretty calm.
I have been having this dream every night for months.
Dream?
Well, whatever it is.
You' re really here, aren' t you?
What' s happening to me?
Dr Sid is implanting the 7th spirit directly into your body.
Then you are my spiritual support.
Gray, how sweet of you.
I don' t think you realize how serious this situation is.
Something you should see here, sir.
And I am watching... what, major?
It seems Dr Ross has been recording her dreams.
And why would I be interested in it... her dreams?
This is our evidence.
She' s under influence of the phantoms.
Dr Ross' s dreams should be all the Council needs authorize the firing of the Zeus cannon.
The Council is contempt to hide powering inside this barrier while the world dies a little more everyday.
I believe they need a push in the right direction, major.
Get another a group of your most trusted men.
What are they doing?
Why are they staring at us?
Not at us.
Welcome back, captain.
Is it over?
How is she, Doctor?
She is going to be fine.
We need to find the 8th and final spirit to cure her.
Aki, can you hear me?
I' d finished it.
I know what the phantoms really are.
Nobody move!
You are all under arrest!
We have them, sir.
Sir?
My wife and daughter.
Were killed by phantoms in San Francisco when the city was attacked.
Did I ever tell you that?
And then at the end, you' re feeling something next to you.
You' ve lost family, haven' t you?
Yes, sir.
That' s why I trust you.
All for you.
You know what must be done.
Major, arrest these man.
Reduce power to sector 31.
Sir, you do realize that the phantoms...
What I realize, major is that we must force the Council to take action against the enemy.
25%% of energy redirect.
Over ring power put to sector 31.
Bury the bridge in sector 31, General.
They' re coming through now.
I think we can easily handle a few phantoms in a contain space.
Relax, major.
When this night is over, you are going to be a hero.
Aki, I don' t think...
You were in my dream, Gray.
You saw it.
That' s just it.
I' m not sure what I saw.
How can you be?
Captain, please.
Let her continue.
And the giant one' s roaming away slants.
Excuse me, Doc.
But frequent relationship.
And your flying phantoms.
The big fat giant phantoms...
- Down, boy.
- He' s right.
You know there is no relationship.
Is like a zoo out there.
Precisely, I think the giant ones are like our whales along for the ride?
It must be the ship of some kind crazy known as ark.
We always assume that the media was intended as a form of transportation.
Perhaps it wasn' t.
The media is a chunk of their planet.
They got thrown into space when they destroyed their world.
But how could they survive the trip across outer space on a hunk of rock?
They didn' t.
This is all beginning to make a creepy kind of sense.
What do you think about all this, captain?
I think that explains why we never had a chance.
All our strategies are based on one assumption.
That me are fighting alien invaders.
Think of the dream, Gray.
How they die?
Since then, all they know is suffering.
They are not an invading army.
They are ghosts.
How many phantoms?
More than enough to convince the Council, sir.
Excellent.
Send the squad out to eliminate them.
Yes, sir.
Sir, I have numerous phantoms contacts.
Well, of course you do.
Outside sector 31, sir.
And moving in incredible speed.
Major, what the hell is going on here?
They are in the pipes.
That' s impossible.
No living thing could survive in those pipes.
Well, we got a big one heading this way.
Oh my god...
Hold your fire!
What have I done?
Come on, Neil.
We need to find a way out.
Now think.
Captain, these wall titanium alloy.
And the bars are all pole sonic lasers.
I mean is not like I can just wave a magic wont and...
Neil, I' m impressed.
That makes two of us.
Proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.
I think we should proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.
Proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.
Here they come.
But the others...
Dr. Sid!
Deep Eyes will take care of him.
Come on!
What' s happening?
Why can we see them now?
It must be carry resistible charge passing through the barrier.
Behind you!
On the board, captain.
We must find my ship.
If it was towed inside the city, it could be in the military hangar.
That' s a big 'If'.
Look out!
- Get us out of the platform.
- You got it.
Okay, now what?
- We' re going through the station.
- What?
- Captain, with all respect...
- Excuse me, captain...
We' re going through it.
It' s the only way.
Should I gather all this will be somehow a rough ride.
Doc, you got a talent for understatement.
Hang on, everybody.
Doc?
Interesting.
Anybody hurt?
Captain!
Oh God!
Talk to me, sergeant.
- Give me a hand, Jane.
- No, wait!
We' re risking for the injury.
We need the proper tools to cut him out.
They are in my ship.
No!
No, Doc.
No drugs.
- Captain...
- You heard the man.
We' il find the ship and we' il be back for you.
- I' il stay with him.
- Me too.
Nobody' s staying.
Just give me a gun.
You got it.
Give him a weapon.
Do it!
We' il be back for you, sergeant.
You hear me?
I hear you, captain.
Now get out of here.
Let' s move out.
Aqua isolated T. V.
This is good.
It can be used to retrieve Ryan and transport him safely here.
However we need to replace this plane' s fuel
There could be some lives overpack in the hangar.
Alright, Jane.
Check the hangar.
Neil, get us ready for take off.
Aki and Dr. Sid prep the quad troll.
I' il go to the tower and rotate the air track.
The city maybe lose.
But we are not.
Let' s do this thing and get the hell out of here.
Gray...
Be careful.
You too.
Oh yeah.
Neil, do you read me?
Loud and clear, captain.
This baby would fly itself.
Flight plane is set.
Beginning rotation.
This is not the air track.
We have a problem.
I' m reading an impound tracks detach to the ship.
Can you disengage it from the cockpit?
No, sir.
Permission to go outside and detach the cockpit.
Do it!
There is the problem.
The controls are locked naturally.
Jane, let me ask you something.
You think we' re going to get out here alive?
I mean I' m wondering if anybody is getting out
You think anyone had made it this far?
You think this 8th spirit stuff is going to work and chase out all the phantoms?
I mean what if it is all a bunch of mambo jumbo?
Jane, do you mind if we stop talking?
I gotta concentrate here.
What' s happening down there.
Nothing we can' t handle.
- What' s your status?
- Almost there.
We' re fine, sir.
Jane is negotiating with the extreme residents.
Talk to me, Jane.
No problem here, Captain.
Yes!
Captain, we are good to go.
No!
Jane, get out of there.
Go!
Get the hell out of there!
Jane!
Unseal the power and ready.
Where are you going?
To the cockpit.
The ship is set on autopilot
We are in countdown to leave off.
Wait.
It' s too dangerous.
Aki!
Over here.
You son of the bitch.
Ryan!
Gray, do you read me?
What' s happening?
You and Sid are getting out of here now.
No!
We can' t just leave everyone.
Everyone' s dead.
But you don' t have a choice.
Goodbye, Aki.
I wish I could believe they are in a better place.
I enlarge the scanning parameter to include an area.
The impact crater.
Yes, really.
But nothing can survive there except phantoms.
Precisely.
We suggest that the 8th spirit is a phantom spirit.
I can' t explain it until that moment.
- But once we get down there...
- Wait.
That' s the one way trip.
Yes.
Yes, I expected that' s how you' il valuate our chance.
What am I wrong?
No, I agree.
To extract the 8th spirit from the crater...
Then why should we try it?
Because we don' t need to extract the 8th spirit.
We can bring the final spirit here.
We can go there and complete the wave inside the crater.
Exactly.
And how do we do that... exactly?
That would attach to Aki' s chest plate together the eight spirits and then...
And then what?
And then we wait.
And see what happens.
That' s it?
That' s your plan?
We wait and see what happens?
Yes.
Oh good.
But I got my own plan.
We keep scanning the surface of orbit.
Maybe we' il find the compatible spirit somewhere else.
Aki?
I say we go in.
General Hein, you' re clear to go in to the zero one alpha.
What caused the battle failed, General Hein?
I' m afraid it' s only the matter of time before the phantoms develop into immunity to our barriers.
But I' m ready to see you and the rest of the Council to evacuate to Houston without incident.
It was a terrible suffer this evening.
The Council had reconsidered your proposal fire the Zeus cannon.
I see.
We are transmitting the access code to you now.
And General, best of luck to us all.
Prepare to fire the cannon.
Target, sir?
The phantom crater.
Prepare to drop in three, two, one.
Powering the shield.
Okay, we are over the mini one.
Do you have it inside, Doctor.
There are so many of them?
Yes.
I' m tracking the 8th spirit moving along the crater surface.
Alright.
Now let' s take a closer look.
Ready to fire in 3 minutes.
Overpack set maximum.
Transferring class to other.
Counter thrusters are engaged.
Locks flow the couple.
Status is green.
We have something in the radar over the impact side, sir.
It' s her.
Sir.
Just a traitor on the influence of the enemy.
Continue the countdown.
We' il take them all out at the same time.
We' re closing on the phantom.
Contact in 30 seconds.
Target locked.
Ready to fire on your command.
It' s a match.
It' s a perfect match.
Target' s cannon is ready, sir.
Fire!
What was that?
It' s the Zeus.
They' re firing on the crater.
Aki, Gray, are you alright?
A little shaking.
Stand by.
Sid, the 8th spirit is not on our scanner.
Do you have it?
The 8th has been destroyed.
What are we going to do now?
Nothing.
This mission is over.
We have to get out of here.
Incoming!
What is that?
If you gonna get us out of here, you better do it now.
Hold on!
I can' t hold on to you.
I' m not able to maintain.
Emergency landing procedures.
Come in, come in, please
Aki, Gray, can you hear me?
Sid, I need to talk to the station.
Can you pass us through?
What is that thing?
I don' t know, sir.
Incoming message, sir.
General Hein, you must cease fire immediately.
What are you looking at, in the crater is the living spirit of an alien' s home world.
The planet was destroyed and part of the it landed here.
This is not an invasion.
It never was.
Oh, I see.
And what we have been fighting all this time, Doctor?
Ghosts?
Yes, spirits that are confused, lost and angry.
Oh right?
Earth Gaya.
The fact remains the Earth is under attack from aggressor who must be destroyed at all cost.
The cost maybe the entire planet, sir.
Fire on the alien Gaya would only make it stronger.
I will take your protest to mean, we are in fact persuading the correct course of action.
I suggest you take your last few months and prepare to meet your Gaya.
Continue to fire until the invaders have been destroyed.
General, this is the mis- over- hitting.
We are going to hit again and again.
And keep on hitting it, until it' s dead.
But sir, we not even sure if it has any affect on the other creature.
No affect.
We got them in the run, soldier.
This is the moment of our victory. order you to fire.
This won' t allow us to fire again.
We' il see about that.
Now shield is out, we' re seeking Doc in here.
Come on.
This is not a good place to be.
What the hell is that?
- That' s something I' m thinking, is it?
It' s Gaya.
Definitely not a good place to be.
Are you alright?
I' m fine.
I have to talk to Dr. Sid.
Sid, do you read me?
I' m still here.
We are looking at Gaya.
You hear me, sir?
Gaya!
I think this explains why the ex- spirits appeared here.
Yes.
Yes, that' s it.
A phantom must have changed into the 8th spirit when it starts a new life born on our own Gaya.
If so, it would have been given a different energy signature that set apart from the other phantoms.
You two could not have hope for better location to find a new compatible spirit.
Stay right where you are.
Staying right where we are may not be as easy as it sound.
Don' t shoot any of them.
You could destroy our last hope.
And what do you suggest I do, Doctor?
Ask them to play nice?
Combat strategy is your area of expertise, not mine.
I have a reading here in official.
Do you see it?
Yes, a compatible spirit.
It must be very near you.
Where?
Which one is it?
Which one?
I' m having difficulty now.
Just a moment.
Doctor, it' s getting crowded in here.
We don' t have much time.
Aki... Aki!
With the hope of new life, has Gaya changed the phantom within?
I have it.
Gray, get in here.
I need you.
Do you hear me, Sid?
The wave pattern is completed.
Yes, I read you.
This is wonderful.
I don' t see how you could have found the final spirit.
It found me, Doctor.
I understand.
I don' t understand.
What the hell is going on?
Give me your overpack.
I need to project it in the complete way.
We' il be defenseless.
I hope you know what you are doing, Aki.
We can use the shield to project the wave.
Dr Sid' s theory was right.
I have it, the 8th spirit.
I' m cured, Gray.
Are you sure you have the final spirit?
Yes, yes.
I' m sure.
But how?
How can you know that?
Don' t worry, the phantom told me.
Oh, great.
Shield on.
It' s not working.
We have to do something before it' s too late.
If this doesn' t work, then it' s already too late.
Gray... trust me.
No!
No!
Get down!
Warning system overload.
I know.
Warning system overload.
I know!
But it must be done.
Fire!
Fire!
Damn it!
Fire!
Gray?
Gray!
Don' t leave me, Gray.
I told you this was an one- way trip.
Looks like I was right.
No, Gray.
Hang on, please.
I still have the wave.
We can get through this.
We are going to make it.
We are going to make it.
We both know that isn' t time.
Gray...
Help me.
Gray...
Listen to me.
You saved my life once.
Now I want you to save yourself.
Gray, no.
Please.
Let me do this, Aki.
Trust me.
Don' t leave me, Gray.
You have been trying to tell me death isn' t the end.
Don' t back out on me.
Now I finally believe.
I love you.
Oh, it' s warm.
On the clearest of nights when the winds of the Etherium were calm and peaceful
the great merchant ships with their cargoes of Arcturian sura crystals felt safe and secure
Little did they suspect that they were pursued by pirates
Fire!

Mom, I was just getting to the best part.
Please?
Oh, can those eyes get any bigger?

NARRATOR:
Flint' s secret trove was never found but stories have persisted that it remains hidden somewhere at the fathest reaches of the galaxy stowed with riches beyond imagination -- the loot of a thousand worlds
OK.
Blow your nose.
How do you think Captain Flint did it, Mom?
How' d he swoop in out of nowhere and vanished without a trace?
Come here, you, you li --
I' m gonna get -- oh!
[Pffft]
OK, now it' s time for this little spacer to go to sleep.
You think somebody' il ever find Treasure Planet?

I love you.
Love you, too.

Much better.
I know he had some rough spots... earlier this year, but I really think... that he' s starting to turn a corner.
Mrs. Hawkins?
[Drops dishes]
OK.
Thanks for the lift, guys.
Not so fast.
We apprehended your son operating... a solar vehicle in a restricted area.
Six?
- Thank you.
- Don' t mention it.
- Jim!
- As you are aware, ma' am... this constitutes a violation of his probation.
No, I understand.
Um, but could we just --
Um. ahem. pardon me
Officers, if I might, uh, interject here.
I am the noted astrophysicist Dr. Delbert Doppler.
Perhaps you' ve heard of me.
Uh, I have a clipping.
- Are you the boy' s father?
- Oh!
Eww!
Back off, sir!
Thank you, Delbert.
I will take it from here.
Ahem.
Don' t ever let me do that again.
Due to repeated violations of statute 1 5- C... we have impounded his vehicle.
Any more slip- ups will result... in a one- way ticket to Juvenile Hall.
- The slammo.
Thank you, officers.
It won' t happen again.
We see his type all the time, ma' am.
- Dead- enders.
Losers
- You take care now.
- Let' s motor.
Jim, I have had it.
Do you want to go to Juvenile Hall? ls that it?
SARAH:
Jim, look at me.
Mom, it' s no big deal.
There was nobody around.
Those cops just won' t get off my --
MRS DUNWhDDhE:
Mrs Hawkins!
My juice!
Yes, I' il be right there, Mrs. Dunwiddie.
Jim, I just don' t want to see you... throw away your entire future.
Yeah, what future?
Sarah
Trying to run a business while raising a felon like -- felon... fellow... fellow like Jim.
I' m at the end of my rope.
Ever since his father left well.
Jim' s just never recovered
And you know how smart he is
He built his first solar surfer when he was eight!
I don' t know.
Delbet I' ve tried everything --
Hey, Mister?
[Growling]
Aah!
He' s a- comin '.
Can you hear him?
like the devil himself!
Uh, hit your head there pretty hard, didn' t ya?
He' s after me chest... that fiendish cyborg and his band of cutthroats.
[Coughing]
Oh, my --
Uh, come on, give me your arm.
That' s it.
- Good lad.
- Mom' s gonna love this.
[Sighs]
It helps.
You' il see.
I keep dreaming one day I' il open that door... and there he' il be just the way he was.
[Thunder]
James Pleiades Hawkins!
Mom, he' s hurt... bad!
Me chest, lad.
He' il be comin 'soon
Who' s coming?
[Whispering]
The cyborg!
[Gasps]
[Rumbling]
We gotta go!
- Ohh!
- Aah!
I believe I' m with Jim on this one!
Hallelujah!
[Yelping excitedly]
Don' t move!
PiRATE:
Find it!
Sarah
I' m an expert in the laws of physical science.
- On the count of three -- one...
- Three!
Go!
Go!
That' s it!
Go!
Hyah!
I just spoke with the constabulary
Those blaggard pirates have fled without a trace
I' m sorry, Sarah.
I' m afraid the old Benbow lnn has burned to the ground.
Well, certainly a lot of trouble... over that odd little sphere.
Those markings baffle me
Unlike anything I' ve ever encountered
Even with my vast experience and superior intellect it would take me years to unlock its -- hey!
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait!
[Gasps]
Whoo!
The Coral Galaxy!
Oh!
Wait.
What' s this?
What' s this?
Why, it -- it' s...
No!
That' s Treasure Planet!
Flint' s trove?
The loot of a thousand worlds?
You know what this means?
It means that all that treasure is only a boat ride away.
He' d be able to experience --
Whoo!
Mom, this is it.
This is the answer to all our problems.
Jim, there is absolutely no way --
Don' t you remember, all those stories?
That' s all they were -- stories!
With that treasure... we could rebuild the Benbow a hundred times over!
Well, this is -- it' s just -- oh, my.
Delbert, would you please explain how ridiculous this is?
SARAH:
Now at last, we hear some sense!
- Delbert!
I' il use my savings to finance the expedition.
I' il commission a ship, hire a captain and a crew.
You' re not serious.
Go, Delbert! "
OK.
OK!
[Sighs]
Mom. look
I know that I keep messing everything up... and I know... that I let you down.
But this is my chance to make it up to you.
I' m gonna set things right.
lf I may?
You said yourself, you' ve tried everything.
There are much worse remedies... than a few character- building months in space.
Are you saying this because it' s the right thing... or because you really want to go?
I really, really, really, really want to go... and it' s the right thing.
Jim...
I don' t want to lose you.
Mom... you won' t.
I' il make you proud.
Well. uh. ahem
There we are then.
We' il begin preparations at once.
Jim, my boy, soon we' il be off to the spaceport.
Jim!
Jim!
Wait for me!
Well, Jim, this should be a wonderful opportunity... for the two of us to get to know one another.
You know what they say, familiarity breeds, um... well, contempt, but, in our case --
Look, let' s just find the ship.
[Clank]
- Second berth on your right!
- You can' t miss it.
It' s the suit, isn' t it?
I should never have listened... to that pushy two- headed saleswoman.
This one said it fit, that one said it was my color.
I get so flustered.
Ooh!
Oh, Jim!
This is our ship!
The R. L. S. Legacy!
Stow those casks foward!
Heave together now!
[Squishing noise]
Sorry about that.
I didn' t mean --
Allow me to handle this.
I' m fluent in Flatula, Jim.
[Pffft]
Cool.
Good morning, Captain.
Everything shipshape?
Shipshape it is, sir, but I' m not the captain.
The captain' s aloft.
Mr. Arrow, I' ve checked this miserable ship... from stem to stern, and, as usual, it' s... spot on.
Can you get nothing wrong?
You flatter me, Captain.
Ah, Dr. Doppler, I presume?
Uh, um, yes. l --
- Hello!
Can you hear me?
- Yes, I can!
Stop that banging!
lf I may, Doctor, this works so much better... when it' s right- way up and plugged in.
- Lovely.
There you go.
I' m Captain Amelia...
late of a few run- ins with the Protean armada.
Nasty business, but I won' t bore you with my scars.
You' ve met my first officer, Mr. Arrow.
Sterling, tough, dependable, honest, brave, and true.
Please, Captain.
Oh, shut up, Arrow.
You know I don' t mean a word of it.
Ahem, excuse me.
I hate to interrupt this lovely banter... but may I introduce to you, Jim Hawkins?
Doctor, please!
[Growls]
I' d like a word with you in my stateroom.
Doctor, to muse and blabber about a treasure map... in front of this particular crew... demonstrates a level of ineptitude... that borders on the imbecilic... and I mean that in a very caring way.
lmbecilic, did you say?
Foolishness, I' ve --
May I see the map, please?
Here.
Fascinating.
Mr. Hawkins, in the future... you will address me as "Captain" or "Ma' am."
ls that clear?
Mr. Hawkins?
- Yes, ma' am.
- That' il do.
Gentlemen, this must be kept under lock and key... when not in use.
And, Doctor, again... with the greatest possible respect... zip your howling screamer.
Captain, I assure you l --
I don' t much care for this crew you hired.
They' re... how did I describe them, Arrow?
I said something rather good this morning before coffee.
"A ludicrous parcel of driveling galoots," ma' am.
- There you go -- poetry.
- Now, see here --
Doctor, I' d love to chat -- tea, cake, the whole shebang -- but I have a ship to launch... and you' ve got your outfit to buff up.
Mr. Arrow, please escort these two neophytes... down to the galley straightaway.
Young Hawkins will be working for our cook, Mr. Silver.
What?
The cook?
That... feline!
Who does she think is working for whom?
It' s my map, and she' s got me bussin 'tables?
I' il not tolerate a cross word about our captain!
There' s no finer officer in this or any galaxy.
Mr Silver?
Why, Mr. Arrow, sir.
Bringin 'in such fine and distinguished gents to grace my humble galley.
Had I known, I' d have tucked in me shirt.
A cyborg!
May I introduce Dr. Doppler?
The financier of our voyage.
Love the outfit, Doc.
Well, thank you.
Um, love the eye.
Uh, this young lad is Jim Hawkins.
Uh...
Aw, now, don' t be too put off by this hunk of hardware.
These gears have been tough getting used to... but they do come in mighty handy from time to time.
[Sniffing]
Delightfully tangy, yet robust.
Aah!
Ha ha ha!
I' m just kiddin ', Doc!
Uh, yeah, well...
I' m nothin 'if I ain' t a kidder.
Go on, Jimbo.
Have a swig.
Morph!
You jiggle- headed blob of mischief!
[Chattering]
What is that thing?
"What is that thing?"
He' s a morph
I rescued the little shape- shifter on Proteus 1
Aw, he took a shine to me.
Right?
Yeah.
Nice boy.
We' re about to get underway.
Would you like to observe the launch, doctor?
Would l?
I' il follow you.
Mr. Hawkins will stay here in your charge, Mr. Silver.
Beggin 'your pardon, sir, but --
Captain' s orders!
See to it the new cabin boy' s kept busy.
- Aw, but, no, but -- - No, you can' t --
Whatever.
Well, who be a humble cyborg to argue with a captain?
Yeah.
You know... these purps... they' re kind of like the ones back home on Montressor.
You ever been there?
I can' t say as I have, Jimbo.
I met this old guy, who was, um... he was kind of looking for a cyborg buddy of his.
ls that so?
Yeah.
What was that old salamander' s name?
Oh, yeah.
Bones.
Billy Bones?
Bones?!
Mm- mmm.
T' ain' t ringin 'any bells.
There' s a slew of cyborgs roamin 'this port.
ARROW:
Prepare to cast off!
There' il be plenty work a- waitin 'for you afterwards.
We best be keepin 'a sharp eye on this one, eh, Morph?
We wouldn' t want him strayin 'into things he shouldn' t.
We' re all clear, Captain!
Are we ready to raise this creaking tub?
My pleasure, Captain.
All hands to stations!
Smatly now!
Loose all solar sails!
Heave up the braces
Brace up
Mr. Zoff, engage artificial gravity.
South by southwest, Mr. Turnbuckle, heading 2- 1- 0- 0.
2- 1- 0- 0.
Full speed, Mr. Arrow, if you please.
Take her away!
[Snidely]
Oof!
Upon my word, an Orcus Galacticus.
Smile.
Uh, Doctor, I' d stand clear --
Captain and look at you
You' re as trim and as bonny as a sloop with new sails and a fresh coat of paint
You can keep that kind of flim- flammery... for your spaceport floozies, Silver.
Spaceport floozy, spaceport floozy --
You cut me to the quick, Captain.
I speaks nothing but me heart at all times.
Nothing but me heat
Yep, it -- oh...
A momentary aberration, Cap' n, soon to be addressed.
I got two new friends I' d like you to meet.
Say hello to Mr. Mop and Mrs. Bucket.
Yippie.
Yeah, I got your Mr. Mop.
Watch it, twerp.
What are you looking at, weirdo?
Yeah, weirdo.
Why?
You got something to hide, bright eyes?
Maybe your ears don' t work so well.
Ahem.
Too bad my nose works just fine.
Why, you impudent little --
Go ahead!
Slice him!
Any last words, cabin boy?
Mr. Scroop...
you ever see what happens to a fresh purp... when you squeeze real hard?
What' s all this. then?
You know the rules.
There' il be no brawling on this ship.
Aye, aye, sir.
Any further offenders will be confined to the brig... for the remainder of the voyage.
Am I clear, Mr. Scroop?
Transparently.
SlLVER:
Well done, Mr. Arrow, sir!
A tight ship' s a happy ship, sir.
Jimbo, I gave you a job.
Hey, I was doing it until that bug thing --
Belay that!
Morph?
Keep an eye on this pup... and let me know if there be any more distractions.
So, we' re all here, then.
- Fine.
[Chatters]
After all me finagling getting us hired... as an upstanding crew... you want to blow the whole mutiny before it' s time?
The boy was sniffing about.
You just stick to the plan, you bug- brained twit.
As for the boy, I' il run him so ragged... he won' t have time to think.
Well, this has been a fun day, huh?
Making new friends like that spider psycho.
Heh.
A little uglier.
SlLVER:
Well thank heavens for little miracles.
Up here for an hour... and the deck' s still in one piece.
Um, look, I, uh...
What you did...
Thanks.
Didn' t your pap ever teach you... to pick your fights a bit more carefully?
Your father' s not the teachin 'sort.
No.
He was more the taking off and never coming back sort.
Oh.
Sorry, lad.
Hey, no big deal.
I' m doing just fine.
ls that so?
like it or not, I' il be pounding a few skills... into that thick head of yours to keep you out of trouble.
- What?
I' m not letting you out of me sight.
You can' t do --
You won' t so much as eat, sleep... or scratch your bum without my say- so.
Don' t do me any favors!
Oh, you can be sure of that, my lad.
You can be sure of that.
Put some elbow into it.
You having a little trouble there?
Oh, get away from me.
Oh, Jimbo.
lf I could maneuver a skiff like that when I was your age... they' d be bowing in the streets when I walked by today.
Bowing in the streets.
I don' t know.
Whew.
But I' m gonna change all that.
Are you now?
How so?
Uh, I got some plans.
Gonna make people see me a little different.
Sometimes, plans go astray.
Not this time.
Oh, thank you, Morphy.
So, uh, how' d that happen anyway?
You give up a few things chasing a dream.
Was it worth it?
I' m hoping it is, Jimbo.
I most surely am.
What the devil?
Good heavens.
The star Pelusa... it' s gone supernova!
Evasive action, Mr. Turnbuckle!
Aye- aye, Captain.
All hands, fasten your lifelines!
Mr. Arrow, secure those sails!
Secure all sails!
Reef them down. men!
Ha ha ha ha!
- Silver!
Whoa.
Thanks, lad.
Captain, the star!
[Gasps] a black hole!
Ohh!
No, you don' t, you --
Blast these waves!
They' re so deucedly erratic!
No, Captain.
They' re not erratic at all.
There' il be one more in precisely 47. 2 seconds.
Followed by the biggest magilla of them all!
Of course!
Brilliant, Doctor!
We' il ride that last magilla out of here.
All sails secured, Captain!
Good man!
Now release them immediately!
Aye, Captain.
You heard her, men.
Unfurl those sails
- What?!
- Tying them down!
- Make up your blooming minds!
Mr. Hawkins... make sure all lifelines are secured good and tight!
Aye- aye, Captain.
Lifelines secured, Captain!
Very good!
Oof!
DOPPLER:
Captain. the last wave!
Here it comes!
Hold on to your lifelines, gents!
It' s gonna be a bumpy ride!
Captain!
That -- oh, my goodness.
That was -- that was absolutely -- that was the most --
Actually, Doctor... your astronomical advice was most helpful.
Well, uh, uh -- thank you.
Thank you very much.
[Slap]
Well, I must congratulate you, Mr. Silver.
It seems your cabin boy... did a bang- up job with those lifelines.
All hands accounted for, Mr. Arrow?
Mr. Arrow?
I' m afraid Mr. Arrow has been lost.
His lifeline was not secured.
No, I checked them all.
I checked them all.
They were secure.
I swear.
Mr. Arrow was a...
Ahem.
Fine spacer... finer than most of us could ever hope to be... but he knew the risks, as do we all.
Resume your posts.
We carry on.
It weren' t your fault, you know?
Why, half the crew would be spinning in that black abyss --
I screwed up!
For two seconds, I thought that maybe...
I could do something right, but --
[Sighs]
Just forget it.
Forget it.
Now, you listen to me, James Hawkins.
You got the makings of greatness in ya... but you gotta take the helm and chart your own course.
Stick to it, no matter the squalls... and when the time comes you get the chance... to really test the cut of your sails... and show what you' re made of, well, I hope I' m there... catching some of the light coming off ya that day.
There, there.
Lad, it' s all right, Jimbo.
It' s all right.
Now, Jim, I, um...
I best be getting about my watch... and you best be getting some shut- eye.
Getting in too deep here, Morphy.
Next thing ya know, they' il be saying I' ve gone soft.
Morph?
Morph, knock it off.
Ow!
Hey, Morph!
- Hey, come back here!
- Come back here!
Gotcha, Morph!
That' s it, you little squid.
You little squid.
Squid.
Squid.
Squid.
Squid.
Ha!
Busted!
Look. what we' re saying is we' re sick of all this waiting
There' s only three of them left
We are wanting to move.
We don' t move till we got the treasure in hand.
I say we kill 'em all now
Disobey my orders again...
like that stunt you pulled with Mr. Arrow... and so help me, you' il be joining him!
Strong talk, but I know otherwise.
Scroop?
It' s that boy.
Methinks you have a soft spot for him.
Yeah
Now, mark me, the lot of ya.
I care about one thing, and one thing only!
Flint' s trove.
You think I' d risk it all for the sake... of some nose- wiping little whelp?
What was it now?
"Oh. you got the makings of greatness in ya"
Shut your yap!
I cozied up to that kid to keep him off our scent.
But I ain' t gone soft.
Land ho!
There it is!
Feast eyes and click heels if you got 'em.
Where the devil' s me glass?
Jimbo.
Yeah.
Yeah, we' re playing games.
Oh, I see.
Well, I was never much good at games.
[Click]
Me, too!
Right- o...
Ohhblast it all
Change in plan, lads!
We move now!
Strike our colors, Mr. Onus.
With pleasure, Captain.
Pirates on my ship?
I' il see they all hang.
Doctor, familiar with these?
Oh, I' ve seen -- well, I' ve read --
Uh, no.
No.
No, I' m not.
Mr. Hawkins!
Defend this with your life.
Morph!
Give me that!
Oh, you' re taking all day about it.
Stop them!
To the longboats, quickly!
No!
Chew on this, you pus- filled boils!
Did you actually aim for that?
You know, actually, I did.
Oh, blast it.
Doctor, when I say "now", shoot out the forward cable.
Morph. here!
Morph!
Morph!
[Whistles]
Morph.
Morph.
Morph, come here.
Come here.
Come here, boy.
Come here, boy.
Morph!
- Come on!
- Morph!
Morph, here!
- Morphy!
- Morph!
Now!
Jim!
Parameters met.
Hydraulics engaged.
That' s it!
Come to papa!
Hold your fire!
We' il lose the map!
Captain!
Laser ball at 1 2 o' clock!
Oh, my goodness.
That was more fun than I ever want to have again.
Unh!
Oh.
Oh, don' t fuss.
That' s all.
Cup of tea, and I' il be right as rain.
Mr. Hawkins.
The map if you please.
Morph!
Morph, where' s the map?!
Are you serious?!
It' s back on the ship?
Stifle that blob and get low.
We' ve got company
We need a more defensible position.
Mr. Hawkins, scout ahead.
Aye, Captain.
- Steady, steady.
Now, let' s have a look at that.
Oh, this is fantastic!
A carbon- based life form come to rescue me at last!
I just want to hug you and squeeze you... and hold you close to me.
OK.
Would you just let go of me?
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
It' s just I' ve been marooned for so long.
I mean, solitude' s fine.
Don' t get me wrong.
Ha ha ha!
Am I...
I am, um...
My name is, uh...
B. E. N.!
Of course, I' m B. E. N.
Oops.
- And you are?
- Jim.
Oh, what a pleasure to meet you, Jimmy.
- It' s Jim.
- Anyway...
Look, I' m kind of in a hurry, OK?
I got to find a place to hide, and there' s pirates chasing me.
Oh, pirates!
Don' t get me started on pirates!
I don' t like them.
I remember Captain Flint.
This guy had such a temper.
Wait, wait, wait.
You knew Captain Flint?
I think he suffered from mood swings, personally.
I' m not a therapist, and anyway... but l -- you let me know when I' m rambling.
But that means -- but wait.
But then you gotta know about the treasure?
- Treasure?
- Yeah, Flint' s trove?
You know, loot of a thousand worlds.
Wait. l -- I r- r- remember.
I do. l -- treasure!
Lots of treasure buried in the centroid -- centroid -- centroid of the mechanism.
And there was this big door opening and closing... and opening and closing... and Captain Flint wanted to make sure... nobody could ever get to his treasure... so I helped him...
Aah!
Data inaccessible!
JlM:
BEN?
BEN!
Reboot!
Wait, wait, wait!
What about the treasure?
I want to say Larry.
The -- the centroid of the mechanism, or --
I' m sorry.
My memory isn' t what it used to be.
I' ve lost my mind.
Ha ha!
I' ve lost my mind.
You haven' t found it, have you?
Uh, my missing piece?
My primary memory circuit?
Look, B. E. N., I really need to find a place to hide, OK?
So I' m just gonna be, you know, moving on.
Oh, uh, so, well, then...
I guess, uh... this is good- bye, huh?
I' m sorry that I' m so dysfunctional.
I do understand.
I do.
Bye- bye.
Look, if you' re gonna come along... you' re gonna have to stop talking.
Huzzah!
Oh, this is fantastic!
Me and my best buddy are lookin 'for a...
Being quiet.
And you have to stop touching me.
Touching and talking.
That' s my two big no- nos.
OK.
Now, I think that we should --
Say, listen, before we go out on our big search... um, would you mind if we made a quick pit stop at my place?
Kind of urgent.
I think you just solved my problem
Uh. pardon the mess. people
I would' ve dusted a little more often... but, you know, when you' re batchin 'it... you tend to, uh, let things go.
Aw, isn' t that sweet?
I find old- fashioned romance so touching, don' t you?
How about drinks for the happy couple?
Thank you, we don' t drink... and, uh, we' re not a couple.
Look at these markings.
They' re identical to the ones on the map.
I suspect these are the hieroglyphic remnants... of an ancient culture.
CAPTAhN AMELhA:
Ohh!
Yes, yes.
Now listen to me... stop giving orders for a few milliseconds and lie still.
Very forceful, Doctor.
Say something else.
There' s some more of your buddies!
Hey, fellas!
We' re over here, fellas!
Stop wastin 'your fire!
Hello. up there!
Jimbo?
I' d like a short word with ya.
No tricks, just a little palaver.
Pestilential...
- Ugh!
- Captain.
That means... that he thinks we still have it.
Ah, Morphy!
I wondered where you was off to.
Oh, this poor old leg' s downright snarky... since that game attack we had in the galley.
Whatever you heard back there... at least the part concerning you...
I didn' t mean a word of it.
Had that bloodthirsty lot thought I' d gone soft... they' d have gutted us both.
Listen to me.
lf we play our cards right... we can both walk away from this rich as kings.
- Ha ha ha.
You get me that map... and, uh... an even portion of the treasure is yours.
No.
You are really something.
Now, just see here, Jimbo --
I mean, at least you taught me one thing.
Stick to it, right?
I' m gonna make sure that you never see... one drabloon of my treasure!
That treasure is owed me, by thunder!
Well, try to find it without my map, by thunder!
Oh, you still don' t know how to pick your fights, do you, boy?
Now, mark me.
Either I get that map by dawn tomorrow... or so help me, I' il use the ship' s cannons... to blast ya all to kingdom come!
Morph, hop to it.
Now!
Oh, blast it!
Gentlemen... we must stay together and... and... ohh.
And what?
We must stay together and what?!
Doctor, you have wonderful eyes.
She' s lost her mind!
Well, you gotta help her.
Dang it, Jim.
I' m an astronomer, not a doctor.
I mean, I am a doctor, but I' m not that kind of doctor.
I have a doctorate.
It' s not the same thing.
You can' t help people with a doctorate.
You just sit there, and you' re useless.
It' s OK, Doc.
It' s all right.
Yeah, Doc!
Jimmy knows exactly how to get out of this.
It' s just Jimmy has this knowledge of things.
Jim, any thoughts at all?
Without the map, we' re dead.
lf we try to leave, we' re dead.
- lf we stay here -- - We' re dead!
We' re dead!
We' re dead!
Well, I think that Jimmy could use a little quiet time.
Heh.
So I' il just slip out the back door.
- Back door?
- Oh, yeah.
I get this delightful breeze through here... which I think is important... because ventilation among friends --
You mean the miles and miles of machinery that run through the entire course of the inside of this planet?
Not a clue.
Hey, Doc!
I think I found a way out of here!
No, no.
Jim, wait.
The captain ordered us to stay --
- I' il be back.
- Cannonball!
- So, what' s the plan?
B. E. N., quiet.
OK, here it is.
We sneak back to the Legacy, disable the laser cannons... and bring back the map.
That' s a good plan.
I like that plan.
I' m wondering, how do we get there?
On that.
- Aah!
- BEN. shh!
Sorry. sorry Sorry
OK, I' il get the map.
You wait here.
I' il neutralize laser cannons, sir!
B. E. N.!
B. E. N.!
Yo- ho. yo- ho. a pirate' s life for me
Disable a few laser cannons.
What is the big deal?
All we gotta do is find that one little wire.
Oh, mama.
Yes.
Bad, B. E. N. Bad.
OK, fixing.
That stupid robot' s gonna get us all... killed.
Cabin boy.
BEN:
Whoops OK. don' t panic
Breathing in breathing out
This has gotta be cannons.
Maybe not.
Come on, come on, come on.
[Snickers]
Oh, yes.
Do say hello to Mr. Arrow.
Tell him yourself!
Oh!
[Chirrups]
BEN:
Laser cannons disconnected
Gee, that wasn' t so tough.
Doc, wake up!
I got the map.
Fine work, Jimbo.
Fine work indeed.
Thanks for showing us the way, boy.
What' s this sorry stack of metal?!
Not the face!
You' re just like me, Jimbo.
Ya hates to lose.
Open it.
I' d get busy.
Tie him up and leave him with the others till we -- what?
You want the map... you' re taking me, too.
We' il take 'em all.
It' s OK, Morph.
Don' t worry.
Jimmy, l -- I don' t know about you... but I' m starting to see my life pass in front of my eyes.
At least, I think it' s my life.
Was I ever dancing with an android named Lupe?!
B. E. N., shh.
This isn' t over yet.
We' re gettin 'close. lads
I smell treasure a- waitin '.
I see nothing!
One great, big stinking hunk of nothing!
What' s going on, Jimbo?
I don' t know.
I can' t get it open.
We should' ve never followed this boy!
SlLVER:
I' d suggest you get that gizmo going again. and fast!
Let' s rip his gizzard right out right now!
Throw him off the cliff!
Oh, have mercy.
The Lagoon Nebula?
But that' s halfway across the galaxy.
A big door opening and closing
Let' s see.
Kinapis.
Montressor spaceport.
So that' s how Flint did it.
He used this portal to roam the universe stealing treasure.
But where' d he stash it all?
Where' s that blasted treasure?!
Treasure!
Treasure!
It' s buried in the --
Buried in the centroid of the mechanism.
What if the whole planet is the mechanism... and the treasure is buried in the center of this planet?
And how in blue blazes are we supposed to get there?
Just open the right door.
Wait for me!
Wait for me!
The loot of a thousand worlds.
We are going to need a bigger boat!
This is all seeming very familiar.
I can' t remember why
B. E. N., come on.
We' re getting out of here, and we' re not leaving empty- handed.
But -- but, Jimmy!
A lifetime of searching.
I can touch it.
Do you know what' s strange?
'cause there' s something just -- it' s nagging at the back of my mind.
- Captain Flint?
- ln the flesh!
Well, s- sort of, except for skin, organs... or anything that -- that -- that resembles flesh... that' s not there.
And yet it' s so odd. you know?
I remember there was something horrible
Flint didn' t want anyone else to know but h -- h just can' t remember what it was
Oh, a mind is a terrible thing to lose!
B. E. N., I think I just found your mind.
Hold still.
Jimmy, your hands are very, very cold.
Hello.
I was just think --
It' s all flooding back!
All my memories!
Right up until Flint pulled my memory circuits... so I could never tell anybody about his booby trap!
- Huh?
Flint wanted to make sure... that nobody could ever steal his treasure... so he rigged this whole planet... to blow higher than a Kalepsian kite!
Run, Jimmy!
Run for your life!
You go back and help the captain and Doc!
lf I' m not there in 5 minutes, leave without me.
I am not leaving my buddy Jimmy.
Unless he looks at me like that.
Bye, Jim!
No!
No!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Come back here, ya blighters!
All my life, I dreamed of an adventure like this.
I couldn' t have been more helpful to you.
Oh, don' t be daft.
You' ve been very helpful.
Truly.
Excuse me, brutish pirate.
Yes, you.
I have a question.
ls it that your body is too massive... for your teeny- tiny head... or is it that your head is too teeny- tiny... for your big, fat body?
I pummel you good!
I have one more question.
ls this yours?
Morph, we are so out of here!
Jimbo!
Aren' t you the seventh wonder of the universe?
Get back!
I like you, lad, but I' ve come too far... to let you stand between me and me treasure.
Oh, no, you don' t!
What?
Jimbo.
Reach for me now!
Reach!
l -- I can' t!
Oh, blast me for a fool!
Silver, you gave up?
Just a lifelong obsession, Jim.
I' il get over it.
Jimmy!
Hurry, people!
We got exactly two minutes... and thirty- four seconds till planet' s destruction!
You' re doing fine, Doctor.
Now ease her over gently -- gently!
We were better off on exploding planet!
Take us out of here, metal man!
Aye, Captain!
Captain, you dropped from the heavens in the nick of --
Save your claptrap for the judge, Silver!
Missile tail demobilized, Captain!
Thrusters at only 30% of capacity.
30%?
That means we' re --
We' il never clear the planet' s explosion in time.
- We gotta turn around.
- What?
There' s a portal back there.
It can get us out of here!
DOPPLER:
Jim. but didn' t that potal open onto a raging inferno?!
Yes, but I' m gonna change that.
I' m gonna open a different door
Captain, really, I don' t see how this is possible --
One minute, twenty- nine seconds till planet' s destruction!
- What do you need, Jim?
- Just some way to attach this.
Stand back.
Stand back, now.
There you go.
Now, no matter what happens... keep the ship heading straight for that portal.
Fifty- eight seconds!
Well, you heard him!
Get this blasted heap turned 'round!
Doctor, head us back to the portal.
Aye, Captain.
Go to the right!
I know, I know!
Will you just let me drive?!
Twenty- five seconds!
No!
Come on, lad.
Seventeen seconds!
Seven six five four three... two...
Wow!
You done it.
Didn' t I say the lad had greatness in him?
Unorthodox, but ludicrously effective.
CAPTAhN AMELhA:
I' d be proud to recommend you to the interstellar academy They could use a man like you
Just wait until your mother hears about this!
Of course, we may downplay the life- threatening parts.
Jimmy, that was unforgettable!
I know you don' t like touching... but get ready for a hug, big guy, 'cause I gotta hug ya!
Hey, you hugged me back.
Oh, I promised myself I wouldn' t cry.
Does anyone have a tissue?
- Morphy, we gotta make tracks.
JlM:
You never quit. do you?
Ah, Jimbo!
I was merely checking to make sure... our last longboat was safe and secure.
Well... that should hold it.
I taught you too well.
lf you don' t mind, we' d just as soon avoid prison.
Little morphy here, he' s a free spirit.
Being in a cage, it' d break his heart.
What say you ship out with us, lad?
You and me, Hawkins and Silver... full of ourselves and no ties to anyone!
You know, when I got on this boat...
I would' ve taken you up on that offer in a second... but, uh, I met this old cyborg... and he taught me that I could chart my own course.
That' s what I' m gonna do.
And what do you see of that pal of yours?
A future.
Why...
look at ya, glowing like a solar fire.
You' re something special, Jim.
You' re gonna rattle the stars, you are.
Got a bit of grease in this cyborg eye of mine.
[Sobbing]
I' il see ya around, OK?
See ya around.
Morphy, I got a job for ya.
I need you to keep an eye on this here pup.
Will ya do me that little favor?
Aye- aye, Captain.
Oh, and one more thing.
This is for your dear mother... to rebuild that inn of hers.
Stay out of trouble, ya old scalawag.
Why, Jimbo, lad... when have I ever done otherwise?
It' s good to see the sun and feel this place
Far away
911.
What is your emergency?
I' m tired of the way things are, as opposed to the way they should be.
Is this an emergency?
Where are you located?
That really doesn' t matter.
- Can we have your name?
- Of course.
Common denominator.
Your man on the street.
Now don' t ask another question, or I will be obliged to do bad.
Andyou would have to assume responsibility.
No interruptions.
Natural selection.
Natural selection.
Born to win.
Born to lose.
Born to die.
Three situations that make up everything in the world.
No interference is necessary.
But interference happens.
I enjoy doing.
I don' t believe people are not good by nature, not at all.
So ifyou remove the authority, the police,
then you' il see life as God intended it to be.
A world ofpandemonium.
Without police, the weak and diseased would be gone.
Streets red with blood.
The way nature intended it to be.
There will be another body found tonight.
Thank you foryour time.
April fool, right?
- You' re kidding, right?
- You' ve picked a very fine diamond.
I' il tell you what, throw in a car and I' il take it.
Throw in a hand, I' il take it.
Perhaps a lesser gem would be more appropriate?
Nah, it' s perfect.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
What' s up, Malloy?
You' re losing your touch.
He' il get you in the rematch.
Don' t you worry, buddy.
I got plans tonight and they don' t include you guys.
I' il get killed if I don' t go.
She' il be pissed anyway.
One more round isn' t gonna make a rat' s ass difference.
I forgot I was dealing with the stable- relationship brain trust here.
You guys ever heard of quittin 'while you' re ahead?
You got a little drinking problem in this area over here.
Give this guy another pop.
You feds any closer to nailing that son of a bitch?
What d' you wanna hear?
I got him giftwrapped out in the trunk.
- We' re gettin 'close.
- That' s bullshit.
- No, we' re getting close.
- I hope so.
- Tucker didn' t deserve that.
- No cop does.
He' s puttin 'bodies on display like trophies.
Son of a bitch knows we' re the ones who have to look at 'em, that' s why.
Look, I' d love to tell you we got this guy ready for a toe tag and a slab.
But we' re dealin 'with a different kind of street logic here.
It' s a whole different breed.
There' s no repeatable patterns.
There' s no identifiable method.
He' s targeting cops, different precincts, different times.
Every site' s clean.
But he' s gonna fuck up.
They all do.
When he does, we' il nail him.
Come on, Malloy.
We' ve had nine dead cops inside of six months.
If this was nine dead feds we were talkin 'about, that would be a different story.
A different story?
You really think I give a shit what kind of badge a man wears?
I think you' re feelin 'guilty because you and your fed friends are droppin' the ball.
What happened to you, Malloy?
You used to be one of us before you became a fed.
Ease up.
We' re all on the same team here.
Yeah, ease up.
You finished?
Oh, yeah, everyone here knows I' m an asshole.
- You are an asshole.
Everyone knows that.
That' s a fact of life.
Bring these guys anything they want, please.
Just keep their mouths full.
Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.
You wanna tell me why you were late for dinner?
- Very funny.
- Got an excuse?
Sorry.
- How was Donovan' s?
- How do you know I was at Donovan' s?
- Cos I called.
- No, you didn' t.
No, I didn' t.
- That was my imitation of your ex- wife.
- Ouch.
Come on, don' t go there.
What happened to our date?
These guys are goin 'through a bad time, so I was just talkin' to them a little bit.
It' s always gonna be somethin '.
If not this, somethin 'else, Mary.
What is this?
The beginning of a "you' re just too good for me" speech?
- Is that what this is?
- Stop bustin 'me already.
Why not stay with me?
Are you tryin 'to tell me somethin', huh?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
I have a surprise.
I got this great surprise, but it' s gonna have to keep for a while.
I' m gonna give it to you, but I wanna have a clear head when I do.
Whatever happened to roses?
Roses?
Obviously you haven' t been reading Cosmopolitan.
Obviously.
Romantically speaking, roses are totally obsolete and monkeys are the new language of love.
I didn' t know that.
Well, if that' s the case... why don' t you and your little friend come to bed?
I think we just got lucky.
Forget it.
I work alone.
- I could have made it myself, you know.
- And you would have gotten another DUl.
Hey, Jimmy, are you gonna tuck me in?
Christ.
Jimmy?
What the hell is this?
A treasure hunt?
Everybody make sure you step on every damn thing you can.
You see anything you want, just take it on home.
- Friend of yours?
- Yeah.
A long time.
I can' t find any sign of gunpowder tattooing.
The shooter was most likely several feet back.
He was in whispering distance.
See the starburst splitting of the skin here, Doc?
Gun was pressed directly against the head.
The killer wanted him to feel the barrel.
Nine dead cops inside of six months.
If this was nine dead feds we were talkin 'about, that would be a different story.
Let' s cut him down.
How long do you plan to have him hang there?
Junior hasn' t finished analysing the body.
What do you think you' re gonna find?
Why don' t you get that club out of his throat?
- He' s a cop!
- Let me handle this.
- Fine.
- Hello?
- Let me speak with Agent Malloy.
It' s for you.
Thanks.
It' s Malloy.
- You andyour friend were out late.
- Who is this?
Tell me, Malloy, what do you see in that dead cop 's eyes?
Do you see recrimination?
Because it' s your fault.
Who is this?
They' ve all died because of you.
- What are you talkin 'about?
- We' il get to that.
But first things first.
You know, she' s got a lovely place here.
Nice neighbourhood.
It almost looked safe... until now.
You really should have stayed home and played house, instead of playing hunter.
He' s at my house.
Her name is Mary, right?
I' il bet she has nice eyes.
- He' s at my fuckin 'house!
- 1311 Oak!
Westside.
Go!
Come on, Mary.
- Send all available units.
I' m sorry, but Mary can' t come to the phone right now.
What do you want?
You' re the agent in charge ofmy case, aren' t you?
That' s right, so whatever you gotta do, do it to me!
I am doing it to you, Malloy.
And I' m doing it to her.
You still haven' t told me what you want.
Four years ago you were in charge ofan investigation ofa series ofmurders.
Atrocities against prostitutes.
I call it removing diseased filth.
You got very close to getting me.
You' d rather protect them and remove me.
You made my life hell.
So now I' m returning the favour.
- Keep him talking, Jake.
- Hunting the hunter.
I won' t live long.
The odds are against that.
So what time I have left, I will dedicate to you.
I' il always be close, like hide - and- seek.
Now, about Mary...
To kill a man is easy, but kill what he loves and he dies a thousand times.
Please don' t hurt her.
Please.
I' il see you, butyou won' t see me.
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Where is she?
Mary!
Mary!
Oh, jeez.
Agent Hendricks!
We got him.
Hey, Tommy!
What' s the story?
Security guard spotted him covered in blood, dressed in SWAT gear.
Son of a bitch didn' t say a word, just opened fire.
- Guard OK?
- He took one in the leg.
Lost a lot of blood.
Called for backup before he passed out.
I see you, you see me.
You on the roof, identify yourself.
Identify yourself now.
This is the police.
You buyin 'shares in this place?
Hey.
Kill me again.
Listen to me.
I...
I' ve been diggin 'around.
There' s this place out in Wyoming.
It' s a detox centre.
Just hear me out this time.
It' s run by a former cop for cops.
You know... if she' d never met me, never knew me, she' d still be alive.
I' m where I wanna be, where I should be.
That' s where I am.
OK.
I' il make you a deal.
You blow your brains out like a damn man and stop pissing on Mary' s memory one sorry- ass day at a time, and I' il take care of your tab.
What the fuck is...?!
What' s the matter with you?!
It' s all right, everybody.
A little accident.
Everybody relax.
What' s the matter with you?!
Whether you like it or not, you still got a life to live.
It doesn' t end here.
Do you believe in reincarnation?
Transmigration of the soul?
Any of that stuff?
I do believe I was a shitkicker in a previous life.
Well... nothing a few nice curtains couldn' t fix up.
Hey, look, partner, if you ever need to return the favour, make it Miami.
We run a dual diagnosis programme here.
A fancy way of saying we' re gonna detox your ass and then tackle your demons head- on in group sessions.
I was a cop for 12 years before I took a shot at drinking myself to death.
So I know what keeps you up at night.
Gonna make it all go away, huh?
Not even gonna try.
No magic wands here.
The shit you swallowed doesn' t digest.
You carryin 'a weapon, Mr Malloy?
I' il have to confiscate it.
Need the shield, too.
We don' t allow crutches here.
Thought I' d stick around awhile, burn up a little vacation time, maybe even rent me a cabin.
Do some ice fishing?
Yeah, why not?
See if I can' t catch more than a shot glass.
Hey, this is gonna be a piece of cake.
Doc.
The man' s my better half.
I sure as hell don' t intend to lose him out here in Jerkwater, Wyoming.
Do you follow me?
Jack.
See if you can' t find some boots and a parka for this man.
Anything to serve these fine officers, Doc.
You might run into more than a cool breeze up here.
Come on.
Let' s get you checked in.
The place was built in the 50s as a command control centre for Strategic Air Command.
Satellites made the facility obsolete, so they converted it to a military asylum.
Uncle Sam put it on the market last year.
It' s isolated as hell and that' s why I chose it.
You' re the last of our patients to arrive.
You know the rules, Slater.
No smoking in the rooms.
I' d like you to meet Jake Malloy.
We got nothin 'to hide here, including our names.
Slater, Metropolitan Police Department of London.
I know it' s a long way to come to quit the shakes.
Club Med was fully booked.
Ain' t exactly Betty Ford, huh?
Last place I was at was a Twelve Step health spa.
Mud baths, nature walks.
We don' t got TV here.
Convicted felons, Doc, get TV.
- Jaworski here' s a narc.
- And a hell of a sharpshooter.
Shut up, limey!
Nobody' s talkin 'to you.
This is Jake Malloy, FBl.
Hey, we got a fed gracin 'our presence.
Hey, Malloy, any idea of the three most overrated things in the world?
Home cookin ', home fuckin' and the FBl.
Let' s get your blood and urine sample, see what we' re up against.
Our resident psychiatrist was an air- force consultant here for four years.
When the facility shut down, she signed on with us.
She' s pulling double duty as a nurse, till we get fully staffed.
We used to take care of almost 100 patients here.
There' s only ten of you cops.
But judging from your case files, I don' t think anyone' s gonna be bored.
This is Jack Bennett, one of our orderlies.
Jake Malloy, new arrival.
If you need anything, ask Jack.
He knows the place like the back of his hand.
That' s what they say.
I know every inch of this nuthouse.
Anything else, ma' am?
I don' t think so.
Manny, this is Jake.
See if you can fatten him up.
Hey.
Hope you ain' t a vegetarian.
- Gilbert, say hi to Jake.
- Hey, Jake.
How you doin '?
You wanna hear about the generator?
Don' t worry.
I' il keep her hummin 'with spit and balin' wire if I have to.
- And the boiler' s about to go, too, Doc.
- Then fix it.
You' re the caretaker, Hank.
Have you managed to get settled in?
First night' s a bitch.
- How long you been here?
- Couple of days.
No one' s been here more than a week.
Don' t have to meet them to know them.
Take Noah there, all buffed out like a fag.
Completely paranoid.
Back- to- the- wall type.
Got SWAT written all over him.
Fuck!
Fuckin 'motherfucker' s motherfucked!
Lopez.
LAPD.
Reverend Jones.
Worked homicide before he found Jesus at the bottom of a bottle.
Check out Jaworski.
This guy couldn' t even swallow a bullet.
Stupid fucker missed his brain and blew half his cheek out.
See the old guy?
McKenzie.
Member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Word is he froze up, let his partner get shot.
They put him on the rubber- gun squad.
All right, let' s get started.
This is what I call the witchin 'hour.
No lessons, no Twelve Steps.
This is your time.
They told me to put 'em in the bag.
The pieces.
They were so tiny.
Little fingers.
Every once in a while I' d get a whole hand or... part of a leg.
Mostly blood.
It was everywhere.
Their little fingers were just... rolling around.
I dropped it.
I...
I tried to gather 'em up, but there was so much blood.
I can still smell it.
21 preschoolers were blown to pieces.
Some of their fingers still had paint on 'em.
They were finger- painting when it happened.
You got somethin 'to add, Noah?
This ain' t the Boy Scouts.
This ain' t about helpin 'old ladies across the street.
- He' s just a kid.
- Oh, bullshit.
He' s just weak, like the rest of you mamsy- pamsy motherfuckers.
If you can' t stand the smell of trash, why are you workin 'in the garbage business?
Maybe he' s not as strong as us.
Maybe he never learned to like the smell.
You laugh it up, smiley.
You sure as shit won' t see me swallowing my gun.
So what do you swallow?
A fifth of gin?
Maybe a little speed?
- It ain' t the same.
- Yes, it is.
Let' s be clear about somethin '.
You people landed here for a reason.
It' s not just your careers you' re killin '.
Booze may be a slow burn, but it' s still suicide.
De luxe cabin, my ass!
How' d it go?
The first session.
I don' t know.
What do you wanna hear?
I got no more demons, no more monsters?
We all have demons.
But I stopped believing in monsters when I was 12.
That' s cos you never met any.
Don' t be naive, Jenny.
Is that her ring?
Look, I know you mean well, but you' re in way over your head on this one.
Do you think words are gonna make a difference, gonna change anything?
They' re not.
So just do yourself a favour and don' t waste your time on me.
Looks like we' re in for one.
You know, my Mary had a scarf like that.
- We can' t have this goin 'on here!
- Keep out of everybody else' s business.
- Don' t jump over my ass.
He' s the one...
- I' m sure he didn' t mean anything by it.
- It' s a misunderstanding.
- Yeah.
Something like that.
- The point is he ripped it off.
- Yeah!
Fine.
Suppose he ripped it off.
What do you wanna do about it?
Did you take it?
Jack?
Maybe you should give it back.
Thanks for the light, old- timer.
Stupid cops.
How you doin '?
Do you wanna get some air?
If you wanna talk, I' m right over here.
Looks like we' il be in this place a while.
Hey!
No!
It' s OK.
It' s OK.
It was just a nightmare.
Can I help you?
Here, take these.
They' il help you sleep.
- Would you mind?
- Would I mind what?
Stayin 'a minute.
Oh, God.
Can' t get through.
Storm must have knocked down the lines.
It ain' t like anyone' s gonna make it out here anyway, boss.
We' re socked in.
I ain' t gonna think about ploughin 'until the storm breaks.
What are we gonna do?
Break the news to the group.
Hank, you get Gilbert up here to help you move the body.
I think I' il be goin 'with just a salad tonight.
- Did he leave a note?
- None that I could find.
No offence, Doc, but this mini- Alcatraz you got goin 'here ain' t gonna change a goddamn thing.
You may dry a few of 'em up, but you ain' t gonna change what they' re made of.
The boy was weak.
We all knew that.
It was just a matter of time before old Humpty fell off the wall.
And what about Dudley Do- Right there, huh?
What a peach he is.
30 years of bullshit war stories, only to leave his partner for dead.
Alone.
No one to watch his back.
There' s nothin 'worse in my book than a goddamn yellow cop.
You see what I mean, Doc?
You ain' t the Wizard of Oz here.
You can' t just hand out courage.
You' re real good at kickin '' em when they' re down, aren' t you?
- Do OK when they' re standing up, too.
- You never stood up to anybody.
Yeah?
Well, at least I' m there for my women.
That' s enough.
Hey, Doc!
Check it out!
Man overboard!
- Get my bag.
It' s in the office.
- Earthquake!
- He' s had alcohol.
- What' s wrong?
He' s on disulfiram.
Makes you puke if you even smell booze.
- He looks bad.
- Shit!
- Give us a hand.
- What do you want me to do?
- Hold him.
Hold him still.
A little Aqua Velva over the rocks?
I rest my case, Doc.
Hold him.
- I want everyone' s belts.
Off with them.
Now!
- Shoelaces, too.
Do it!
I want the rooms checked every hour on the hour.
Anything you say, Sheriff.
Hey, you know that hospital about ten or so miles up the canyon?
- You mean the old loony bin?
- Yeah, right.
I got a friend I' m tryin 'to ring stayin' up there.
Your friend sick in the head, is he?
In more ways than one.
Well, the lines are down.
You a cop?
Thought so.
Been a few passin 'through here lately.
One took a cabin for the night, bought out all my Scotch, damn near tore it down.
Another looked like he shaved with a cheese grater.
So how are the fish biting?
You happen to see what' s goin 'on outside?
It' s called the dead of winter.
I meant ice fishing.
I' d love to try my luck.
Maybe you could help me out.
Maybe.
Fact is, you couldn' t have picked a better time of year.
We both know that if someone really wants to kill themselves, there' s no stopping it.
I know you have to believe that, Jenny.
But I can' t.
That' s what this place is about.
Stoppin 'em.
I don' t get it.
Why do you put yourself through this?
You got family, Malloy?
- No, I don' t.
- Neither do I. No.
The job is all I got.
I' m not a coward, you know.
I know that.
But try and remind yourself now and then.
That goes both ways.
Can' t sleep?
I didn' t mean to spook you.
I never knew.
Knew you could miss someone so much?
I didn' t know that.
Just remember that sometimes the real bad things in life can make you stronger.
What' s the matter, cowboy?
Somebody steal your horse?
No, I just thought I heard something.
Like what?
I don' t know.
Something.
Cock- a- doodle- doo!
Good morning to you!
Rise and shine, lazy ladies!
It' s a wonderful day in the neighbourhood!
Wakey, wakey!
Oh...
Doc!
Doc!
Doc!
Two suicides back- to- back?!
Get Mr Fed in here.
He' s seen his share of dead officers.
The bruise is in the shape of an inverted V.
- What does that mean?
- The markings say it' s a suicide.
The V is from the noose.
If he was strangled, it' d be a straight- line bruise.
Hey, Doc.
The waiting list for this place is getting shorter by the minute.
Still taking bets on who the next suicide' s gonna be?
The man didn' t say it was a suicide.
He just said the markings say that.
And God shall wipe away all the tears from their eyes.
And there shall be no more death.
Neither shall there be any more pain.
I' m tearin 'up here, Reverend
Shit!
I can' t risk finding any more bodies.
I' il have to lock you in your rooms.
- Oh, you gotta be kiddin 'me!
- I need to review everyone' s case files.
- Lookin 'for what?
- Answers.
Look, man.
Solitary confinement?
No fuckin 'way, man!
- It' s for your own safety.
- Nobody lockin 'me up in no cell!
Is somethin 'funny?
If the idea of a bunch of cops being locked up like common criminals isn' t a joke, what is, then?
Doctor Mitchell, can I have a word?
- What?
- Jack' s missing.
Jack' s your responsibility.
Maybe he took a joyride.
We' re short one snowmobile.
- He' il freeze to death.
- He ain' t the only one!
Boiler bought the farm.
Mm- hm.
Manny!
Afraid soldier boy' s turned into a human ice cube by now.
Yeah, the hell with Jack.
Who knows what that crazy fucker' s up to!
Conner and Brandon.
They weren' t prior suicide attempts, were they?
- I want you to lock your room tonight.
- Why?
Please.
Just do it.
Damn!
Hey!
Hey!
Come back here!
Jack?
Jack!
Jack!
We' re droppin 'like fuckin' flies!
Knock it off!
You' re losing it.
You' re all losing it.
Slater' s right.
We' re cops.
What would Slater know about bein 'a cop?
Bobbies don' t even carry a gun!
God forbid I put myself on a par with America' s finest.
Shut up!
Communications are down.
Our meds are gone.
One orderly and Doc, who knows where they are!
And we got two bodies.
That, and you' re all in danger of experiencing DT' s.
Sweetcakes, shakes are the least of our worries.
You got a medical degree we don' t know about?
Let her talk!
I' m not talking about the shakes.
Grand mal seizure caused by DT' s... can kill you.
- Without meds, you' re all vulnerable.
Hey, lady?
What the hell is he talkin 'about?
- I don' t know.
- Bullshit!
You tell 'em, or I will.
Jenny, Doc' s missing.
Two men are dead.
If there' s something you need to tell us, now is the time.
- You should check his service record.
- I already did that.
- The guy was a patient here.
- Oh, that' s great!
The son of a bitch murdered his commanding officer over in South Korea.
Strangled him.
Psycho!
- And you gave this crazy fuck a job?!
- Come on, Lopez!
Back off.
Since when did protecting women become your specialty, Malloy?
You' re right.
It' s not.
My specialty... is doing my job... while the one good thing in my life is home, being butchered.
You talk about her again, I' m gonna kill you.
How' d Jack end up working here?
I vouched for him.
He was totally rehabilitated.
- What about Gilbert?
- A manic- depressive.
He hates violence.
Look, Jack' s got nothing to do with this.
I know that.
Hey, people!
Gilbert found Doc.
Jones.
Jaworski.
Noah.
Lopez.
That' s the Scotch drinker, all right.
Guess he never made it to detox.
- You' re tellin 'me this guy' s a cop?
- Well, that' s what he said.
Now, what the hell is goin 'on up there?
I need to get up there.
Whoever did this must have used a sledge.
They hammered the living shit out of these carburettors.
The snowmobiles are finished.
Let' s take the Suburban, go for help.
If I had extra hands, we could dig our way out if we get stuck.
- The freezer' s fillin 'up fast.
- I think he' s right.
Hank, take Jenny and Gilbert.
Manny can help with the digging.
No.
Weeks can' t be moved.
We need someone here with medical expertise.
It' s not a request.
You don' t have to be here.
Where would I be safer?
Riding through a whiteout with some yahoo like Hank, or sitting here in a room full of armed officers?
How about you?
No way.
I' m gonna go down with the ship.
You guys go while there' s still some light.
We' re outta here!
C' mon, Gilbert, let' s go.
- Now what?
- We can rotate two- man shifts on watch.
- Who made you king shit?
- He' s ranking officer.
- I ain' t in uniform.
- I thought SWAT boys were team players.
My team doesn' t wait around to get hit by a shitstorm.
We are the shitstorm.
I' m with Noah.
I say we find this crazy piece of shit and Frosty his ass.
How do you know it' s Jack?
How do you know that?
How do you know it' s not...
Lopez, or Jones?
How do we know it isn' t Slater?
How do I know it isn' t you?
Me?
Yeah... right!
You better keep an eye on that one, nursie.
He crackin '!
Split the building into sections.
Each person will clear an area.
Point me in the direction.
I see you.
Butyou won' t see me.
He' il die without it.
Jenny, where' d you find Conner' s body?
Hank!
Do ya think we can get the truck through yet?
Keep digging, Manny.
What was that?
- Gilbert' s gone!
- I don' t give a shit where he' s gone!
We' re gettin 'the hell outta here!
Get in the truck.
What' s that?
Look out!
Look out!
Anything scares you, kill it.
Hank!
Where' d you go?
Hank!
Jack!
Jack.
Gilbert!
- Wait!
Hey.
Frozen corpses don' t bite.
- You' re used to seeing bodies.
I' m not.
- It' s OK.
Weeks is burning up.
I need ice.
Will you get it for me?
Who' s the fuckin 'brainiac that locked the door?!
- Shit!
- What were you doing outside?
Noah told me to check for tracks.
- Did you see Malloy?
- Why?
Should I have seen him?
Is there something goin 'on here I should know about?
Jack?
Come on, now, Jacky boy...
No more games.
Main circuit board died with McKenzie.
That means no power, no heat.
The emergency lights are not gonna last long.
Great!
It' s gonna be 20 below in here by morning!
This is bullshit!
This is bullshit, Malloy!
- Come on.
- Malloy!
- What happened?
- Jack and Manny are dead.
Hank' s gone.
- Where' s Gilbert?
- He saw me and he bolted.
- He' s still out there?
- I found the missing snowmobile.
Whoever took it burned the personal files.
- Why?
- Makes it impossible to prove who' s who.
One of us isn' t a cop.
Give me a knife.
What are you looking for?
What are you looking for?!
- Confirmation!
- Confirmation of what?!
I see you.
You see me.
- He' s here.
- What are you talking about?
He' s here!
Agh!
Dead...
- Dead... dead...
- What' d he say?
- All dead.
- They' re all dead.
Open up!
Come on, open up!
For the last time, I got out of there when I saw Jack strung up.
I almost got lost in the blizzard.
I' m coming back through the utility tunnels when Malloy comes in.
He' s not just down there for a walk, so I hide behind the woodpile, OK?
It' s not Malloy.
I was with him.
He went out there to help you.
Well, what do I know?!
Malloy should stay locked in my cell.
Just to be safe.
Yeah?
Tell you what... you don' t have to be a fed to read a flashing sign.
Maybe it' s time for Reverend Jones to explain the artwork!
Don' t you ever paw me, boy.
You understand?
Maybe Malloy was right about one of us not being a cop.
Somebody was out there in that storm.
If it wasn' t Hank, or Malloy, who was it?
You were outside looking for tracks, right?
Right.
And I got locked out.
Did you?
Guess my cover' s finally blown.
Ignorant assholes.
It' s not me, it' s one of you.
Get the fuck outta my face!
Get the fuck outta my face!
- Drop the gun!
- Noah, don' t!
- Back off!
- Drop the gun, asshole!
- Mine shoots bullets, too, motherfucker!
- Stop it!
I feel safer already.
Christ, it' s Slater.
I' m very close.
So close, you don' t know it.
I stare into your eyes, andyou see nothing.
I see you.
Butyou don' t see me.
So what did the fed say about all this?
He talked like it was someone he knew.
Someone he tracked.
- The cop killer?
- He' s dead, isn' t he?
He' d better be.
Hey, any cop killer steps my way, I' il cap his ass.
Well, let' s hope you do.
- What do you mean, hope?
- You' ve studied guys like this, Doc.
They don' t just kill you.
They play with you.
Hey, man, I don' t wanna hear this, OK?
They gouge out your eyes, shove things down your throat.
Are you deaf?
Maybe the Lord' s got other plans.
Maybe we' il freeze to death first.
You wanna show us where that woodpile is?
What, are you nuts?!
I ain' t goin 'back down there.
Well, I ain' t goin 'down there by myself.
Lead on.
- Wood store' s down this way.
- Sh!
- You hear that?
- Hear what?
I think we got company.
Not for long.
You two... clear that one.
I got this one.
Come on.
Move!
I found that hidden above Slater' s room.
It' s him.
He' s taking trophies.
If we' re gonna get outta here, here' s what we do.
You and Lopez check upstairs.
I' il take the tunnels.
- Jenny, you stay here with Jaworski.
- Why?!
Please, just trust me.
Hank!
Slater!
Hank!
Slater!
- Hey, cop.
Drop the weapon.
Hands behind your head.
Fingers locked.
That' s it.
Now, on your knees.
You know, I like playing cop.
How do you like playing the victim?
Huh?
D' you like how it feels?
- Come on.
- Please.
Please.
Wasn' t it you who was gonna cap my ass, tough guy?
Open your eyes.
Look at me.
That a boy!
See?
Look here.
You see somebody comin 'up them stairs, you let faith guide that bullet right through their head.
Right?
Malloy.
Malloy!
Malloy.
Malloy!
I see you, Malloy.
Butyou still don' t see me.
Fuck you!
We' ve got to do something!
Why?
Malloy' s already dead.
- Who was he?
- Who?
Your stand- in.
Oh, you mean the real Mr Slater I tracked up here.
Last I saw, he was detoxing at the bottom ofa frozen lake.
I didn' t think you' d mind me borrowing his name and his badge.
From there, it was easy.
Ijust came here and blended in.
You' re real good at blending in, aren' t ya, scumbag?
Is that how you found out about this place?
Just blending in at the cop bar?
That doesn' t matter now.
What matters is I got to you before you got to me.
People will ask if I was insane.
Just the opposite.
An insane man could not have accomplished this.
All these deaths, including Mary' s, weren' t irrational.
They were to prove a point.
You cannot control what nature intended, Malloy.
We 're born to perform a duty, which I' ve done.
And so you finally see me.
Now what?
You know, you never feel more alive than when you' re watching someone else die.
Like when I stared at poor Mary.
But once again, Malloy, you' re too late.
Now I imagine you are staring at poor Noah.
Malloy!
Malloy!
- Malloy!
- Déjà vu, huh, Malloy?
How many second chances do you get in life?
You think you' re strong enough to stop me?
Run, Jenny!
Run!
You' re too young to die.
Run, Jenny!
Run!
Run!
I' il cut her fucking heart out.
I like your eyes.
Let me see your eyes.
Did I mention I hear voices?
Right now I hear Malloy... pleading for his precious Mary.
You stay here!
I' m gonna follow these tracks.
Make me work for it.
Do you see me?
Cos I see you.
Stay... here.
Freeze!
Drop the weapon!
On your knees.
Hands behind your head.
Lock your fingers.
It' s your turn now.
It' s time to die.
Now, look at me.
Slater!
She... called out your... name...
just before I... drained the life... from her.
I see you.
You see... this.
You OK?
How was the fishin '?
Icy.
The inJects take a while to wear off.
Sorry about the restrains.
You have got one hell the right hook.
Where am l?
Arcatic Psychiatric Hospital.
I find that I don' t like it.
For making a mistake.
My work is not a military application.
Which work is that, John?
I don' t know anything.
It' s no good in keeping secrets, you know.
Charles?
I' m sorry...
Charles?
The Portugal roommate reveal.
You saw my name on the lectures league?
You lie, you son of the bitch!
Who are you talking to?
Tell me who you see.
I did see Charles running with the Russians.
There is no one there.
He was there...
Stop!
Stop!
I don' t know anything!
My name is John Nash!
I have been held against my will!
Somebody tell the Department of Defense!
My name is John Nash!
I have been held against my will!...
What' s wrong with him?
People with this disorder are often paranoid.
But his work...
He deals with conspiracies, so...
Yes, I know.
Encouraged.
As such, his nerve may have gone unfree in far any longer than it' s typical.
What do you mean?
How long?
Possibly since graduates schools.
At least that is since his halucinations begun.
What are you talking about?
What the halucinations are?
He imagined he has a roommate named Charles Hermen.
Charles isn' t an imaginary.
He and John are best friends since Princeton.
Have you ever met Charles?
Did he ever come to dinner?
He was always in town for several times, lecturing.
Was he on your wedding?
He...
Have you seen a picture of him or talk to him through a telephone?
This is ridiculous.
I phoned Princeton.
According to a housing record, John lived alone.
Which is more likely, that your husband... a mathematician with no military training.
He is a government spy, flaying the Russians...
You are making him sounds crazy.
Or... he has his grip of reality.
Which is he was real and what is in his mind.
Come on.
What has he been working on?
His work is classified.
A name of William Patcher.
Maybe this Patcher can clarify things for us.
But I can' t get to him without clearances.
You want me to get the details of my husband' s work?
John thinks I am a Russians spy.
ls that what you think?
What did the doctor said?
I don' t know.
I want to see what John has been working on.
Alicia, you can' t go into his office.
You know it is classified, Alicia.
Oh my god...
Oh my god...
Why didn' t you say something?
Alicia...
John has been a little weird.
He say he was doing code breaking, yet that was only eyes only.
Top secret, part of the military...
Was he?
That' s possible.
That was possible.
Possible, but not likely.
Lately he becomes much more agitated.
Then when you called...
So... is this all these he had been doing everyday?
Cutting out magazines?
Well... not all...
I have to talk to you.
Okay.
Alicia, I have been thinking about...
I don' t have other choice.
I do understand.
I' m... really sorry.
That' s okay.
Everything is going to be alright.
Everything is going to be alright.
Just have to talk quietly.
They maybe listening.
There maybe microphones.
When I am telling you everything now, it' s breaking the protocol.
But you need to know.
Because you have to help me to get out off here.
Alicia, I have been doing top secret work for the government.
We cannot stop them for portions.
So I Just simply don' t do it with me.
They are keeping me here, because I tried to stop from doing my work.
You have to go to Wheeler.
You have find William Patcher...
Stop!
Stop!
I went to Wheeler.
Good...
There is no Patcher.
Of course there are, I have been working for...
Doing what?
Breaking codes?
Dropping the packages at the secret mailbox for the government to pick up?
How do you know that?
Sow followed you.
They haven' t been opened.
It isn' t real.
There is no conspirancy, John.
There is no William Patcher.
It' s in your mind.
You understand, baby?
You' re sick.
You' re sick, John.
Code red.
Dr Rosen, code red.
Observation room 2.
John?
John?
The implant' s gone.
I can' t find it.
It' s gone.
He has the nightmare because his friend there.
He' s not knowing what' s true.
Not there.
One kind of hell would that be.
Administering insulin.
How often?
Five times a week.
John always spoke so fondly being here in Princeton.
And Hensen is running the department now.
So he keep reminding us, reminding us.
John won' t come here to the campus though.
It is a shame.
Alicia, how... how are you holding up?
Division has passed.
They are saying with medication and those dressing in...
I mean...
I mean how are you?
It' s obligation.
A guilt... over warning to leave.
John... against God...
But then I look at him.
And i force to see myself the man that I married.
And he becomes that man that he has transform into someone that I love.
And I transform to someone who loves him.
It' s not all of the time, but... it' s enough.
I think John is a very lucky man, Alicia.
Someone lucky...
This is ours.
This is it?
It' s here where I work.
I hope it' s okay.
Hey, chief.
Cigarette?
No, thanks.
I' ve quit, actually.
Have you met Harvey?
You can have a little fun.
I should have know.
Here you go.
You are suppose to take them now.
Can I bring you something?
I' m okay.
I was in town giving a workshop.
I' il go back tonight.
You know, say hi.
But at last, I' m stop with me.
I' m trying to hold the remark on hypothesis.
I figure if I have dazzled it, they would have to reinstead me.
First, it' s difficult with the medication... because it is hard to see the solution.
You should go easy.
There are other things besides... besides work.
What are they?
What are you thinking about?
What do people do?
Slave, John.
Activities are normal.
Just have meaning.
You could try live in a house.
You know, maybe try talk to people.
You can try taking out the garbage.
Who... who' re talking to?
Garbage man.
Garbage man don' t come at night.
I guess here around, they do.
Sorry.
ls that the medication?
My mother is going to keep the baby a little longer tonight.
I' il get three hour overtime.
I' m going to bed.
Good night.
Good night.
Good to see you, John.
It has been a while.
Patcher?
Yes, sir.
You' re not real.
Of course I am.
Don' t be ridiculous.
And don' t think that I will go that way, John.
It' s time for you to get back to work.
The bomb is in it' s final position.
Here in U. S.
Knowing your position, you' il keep a low profile.
We have brought it to the mountain, to you.
We have known the bomb' s location somewhere in the eastern seabroad.
But we haven' t able to pin point it' s exact position.
Their codes have grow to increasing complex.
Look at this, John.
What?
Dr Rosen said...
Let' s get to the definite reality.
Psychological bullshit!
Look at me, John.
John, look at me.
Do I look like an imagine?
Wheeler has no record of you.
Do you think we list our personal?
John, I' m sorry that you have to go through all these.
I' ve gone to a great deal of trouble to get you back.
I can restore your status in Wheeler.
I can let the world know what you did.
But I need you now, soldier.
I am so scared that you are not real.
Listen, I' m not coming.
I am Just going to grab the laundry, okay?
I' il do his bath.
It' s okay.
This is going to wet the baby' s.
Oh God...
He said it was okay.
There' s no one here.
Charles was watching...
There' s no one here.
He has been inJecting with the insulin...
I can see him because it was release in my blood stream...
And my imply resolve.
I can' t tell you because it is all under protection.
Alicia...
No...
Hello, I need Dr Rosen' s office please.
You got to stop her, John.
You leave her out of this.
Who are you talking to?
It' s not her fault.
Don' t you won' t.
You' il go back to the hospital.
Can' t please people, or you will die.
Alicia, please put the phone down.
I can' t let that happen.
Yes, hello.
Yeah, I need Dr Rosen.
ls he in?
I' m sorry I have to do that.
No!...
Alicia, you know I have to do that.
Go away from me...
She is too greater risk.
Go away.
I don' t mean to hurt you.
Finish her.
She knows too much now.
Uncle John.
You take care your pathetic piece of shit or I' il take care off you.
Do what he says.
Now.
Uncle John.
John, please.
Now!
I understand.
She never gets old.
Marcee can' t be real.
She never gets old.
You see them now?
Yes.
Why did you stop your medicine?
Because I couldn' t do my work.
I couldn' t help with the baby.
I couldn' t...
I couldn' t respond to my wife.
I think that' s getting better than being crazy.
We' il need to start you on a higher run of insulin shoots and your medication...
No.
It has to be another way.
Gets to it is generative.
But overtime, you' re getting worse.
So it is.
It' s a problem with no solution.
And that' s what I do.
I solve problems.
It isn' t math.
You can' t come up with a formula that you can change the way you experience the world.
All I have to do is plan my mind.
No theory, no proof.
There isn' t a way out of this.
Why cannot?
Because your mind is the problem in the first place.
I can do this.
I can work it out.
All I need is time.
ls that the baby?
Baby is still at my mother' s, John.
Entirely.
You are almost ready.
Rosen is waiting outside.
I can' t go back to that hospital.
I won' t come home.
He has commitment papers for me to sign.
Or maybe you won' t sign.
Maybe you Just give us sometime.
I will try to figure this out.
Rosen is right about one thing.
You shouldn' t be here.
I am not safe anymore.
Would you have hurt me, John?
I don' t know.
Maybe I should let Dr Rosen try to determine.
Rosen said you wasn' t tried to kill me or anything.
You will know what' s real.
This...
This...
This is real.
Make me the partner to awake from the dream.
Maybe isn' t you.
Maybe it' s here.
I need to believe that something extraordinary is possible.
Come.
Hello, Martin.
Jesus Christ.
I don' t have that one, my savor complex text on the completely different form.
I tried to call you since you left...
Yeah...
I stole it from him.
It seems that you won after all, Martin.
They were wrong, John.
Please.
Have a seat.
It' s so good to see you.
What brings you back to Priceton?
John...
John, I' m sorry.
But you have to tell him.
Tell him you are a genius, John.
Tell him your work is critical, please.
ls there any chance that you could ignore what I Just did?
Of course, what' s old friends for?
Friends?
John, of course.
Of course, we always have been.
I have to fit in to a part of the community.
That might be some good.
Might help me elbow out... from this... from this certain delusions that I have.
So I am here.
Quite some of the people Just say no.
But I was wondering if I could hang around.
Will you be needing an office?
No...
No... lcould Just work out in the library.
But he doesn' t have an lD.
Why can' t people read their memos, huh?
Then he goes totally nuts.
Shit...
You are not real...
The local banned man?
I am not a soldier.
Old, worthless, disguided.
There' s no mission.
The world that you are walking through, the world will burn ash.
You are not real.
You' re still talking to me, soldier.
There' s no mission.
John...
Hey, it' s okay.
I Just heard what happen.
I' m sorry, John.
Hey, Nash.
You are alright.
Ladies and gentlemen, great John Nash!
John!
You should have seen those faces.
John...
You know that stress treats you the delusions.
Charles was there.
Sometimes I really miss talking to him.
Maybe Rosen' s right.
Maybe I should think about going back to the hospital again.
Come here.
Maybe try again tomorrow.
John, you can' t let go me forever.
Charles, you are a very good friend to me.
The best.
But I won' t talk to you again.
I Just can' t.
The same goes to you, baby.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
How is it matter if I' m on your course?
It' s... it' s an honour, Professor Nash.
ls something wrong?
This would be my first class.
Good morning, young lifes.
You' re Just humiliating yourself.
It' s pathetic.
You' re being pathetic.
I' m ashamed of you.
Are you coming?
You' re going to be late.
Dad, you got my book.
What?
You got my book.
Thanks.
Goodbye.
See you tonight.
Bye, honey.
Do you Just solve Rima?
What do you think?
That' s an analogue for non- communitive extensions.
Yes, it is.
I believe I' m making progress.
You' re... you' re John Nash, right?
Hello.
I' m studying your record.
The one you wrote here at Princeton.
To come up with something totally original the way you did.
You know, I was young.
I have been developing a theory.
I believe I can prove the extentions in covering space.
That everything... everything is connected.
That is all part of the same subJect.
When was the last time you ate?
Excuse me.
You know, food.
My wife, she loves mayonnaise.
Thank you.
Go on.
The factor is in two categories.
Alicia.
I was thinking I am not a teacher.
Classroom with 50 students could be don thing for anyone.
John, besides you are a terrible teacher.
I am a quiet taste, Martin.
What about the...
You know, are they gone?
No, they are not gone.
Maybe they never will be.
I think they are kind of giving up on me.
All our dreams and nightmares, Martin?
We got to keep feeding them to let them stay alive?
John, they haunted you...
They might past.
No body is haunted by their past.
Well, goodbye.
John, I' il talk to the department.
Maybe in the spring.
Hey, Nash.
You' re... scared?
Terrify, modify, petrify, stupidfy by you.
Goodbye.
Have a nice day.
Goodbye.
Professor Nash.
Ya.
Are you sure?
How is he?
Forgive me.
I' m Just always suspicious in old people.
See you next week.
Who are you and what can I do for you?
Professor, my name is Thomas King.
And I am here to tell you that you' ve been considered to the Nobel Prize.
I' m Just a little stun.
Over the past few years, your equal liberty has become a corner stone of modern economics.
Suddenly everybody Just about to like that one.
Some mathematic?
The application of your bargaining problem to F. C. C. banned with auctions or to any trust cases...
Yes.
I never would have princip on that.
I Just lead some honesty to some stupidity.
No, you haven' t.
I would never had thought about that.
Shall we have tea?
I don' t go in there.
Come on, John.
Let' s have some tea.
It' s a big day.
Most commercial have my tea in the palette.
I have not been in this room for quite so many years...
Things are certainly change around here.
I have a son that age.
Harvard.
I thought the receivers of the Nobel Prize is to be secreted.
I thought you won' t have find out if you have won or lost.
That is generally the case, but this is circumstances.
The award is Just substantial.
They require private funding as such... the image of the Nobel...
Oh I see.
You come here Just to find out if I' m crazy.
Find out if I' il screw out everything that I actually want.
Strip naked like a chicken thing pours around the nature.
Something like that, yes.
But I embarass you.
Yes, it is possible.
I am crazy.
I take medications.
I still see things that is not real.
I Just choose not to acknowledge.
I choose not to and indulge certain appetites.
Like my appetite to patterns.
Perhaps my appetite to imagine, to dream.
Professor Nash.
It' s good to have you here, John.
It' s an honour, sir.
Thank you very much.
A privilege, professor.
Professor.
Thank you.
Thank you there.
That is most certainly unexpected.
Thank you.
I' ve always believe in numbers.
ln equations, and logics that lead to reasons.
I asked, what truly is logic.
Who decides its reason.
My quests has take them in to the physical, the mental physical, the delusional and back.
And I' ve made the most important discovery of my career.
The most important discovery of my life.
That any logical reasons can be found.
And I am only hitted because of you.
You are the reason I am.
You are all my reasons.
Thank you.
I' il call for the car, dad.
Are you ready to go now?
Yes, indeed.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
What is it?
No.
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
Come with me, young lady.
Trick or treat.
Well, look at this.
All the superheroes on our porch.
Ain' t that cute?
We got Superman here, and Batman... and his sidekick Robin.
The Green Lantern.
And what about you, young man?
- What about what?
- Who are you supposed to be?
- I' m Harvey Pekar.
- Pecker.
Harvey Pekar?
That doesn' t sound like a superhero to me.
I ain' t no superhero, lady.
I' m just a kid from the neighborhood, all right?
Forget this!
Why does everybody have to be so stupid?
Okay, this guy here, he' s our man.
All grown up and going nowhere.
Always a pretty scholarly cat.
He never got much of a formal education.
For the most part, he' s lived in shit neighborhoods, held shit jobs... and is now knee- deep into a disastrous second marriage.
So if you' re the kind of person looking for romance or escapism... or some fantasy figure to save the day, guess what?
- You got the wrong movie.
- That' s great.
So now you got four takes.
You ought to be able to patch one together from there.
Right?
Let' s go to the next one, all right?
Hold on a second.
Do you want some water or something?
- No, I got lots of orange.
- Do you like orange soda?
Yeah, orange is all right.
All right, let' s go to the next sequence.
Did you actually read the script?
No.
A little bit.
Just to check the construction.
You know, how the piece was constructed.
I didn' t read it word for word.
Do you feel weird saying this stuff?
No, I don' t feel weird saying it.
I don' t know how long my voice is going to hold out.
Doc, you gotta help me, man.
My old lady' s dumping me 'cause I can' t talk.
She says I' m a social embarrassment.
Now that she' s got a PhD, she' s some hot- shit academic star... and I' m nothing but a file clerk.
Me being a file clerk was fine when I was signing the damn checks for tuition.
Harvey, stop talking, please, and open wide.
I started worrying my voice would never come back.
Say "Aah," Mr. Pekar.
It' s torture, I' m telling you.
What? ls it bad, Doc?
It' s not good.
It' s cancer.
First I got marital problems, and now you' re telling me I got throat cancer.
- For Christ' s sake, man.
- Harvey, calm down, it' s not cancer.
You have a nodule on your vocal cords, probably from screaming and yelling.
lf you don' t give it a rest, you' re gonna lose your voice completely.
Okay.
But for how long?
- A few months.
- Months?
- Hey, come on, what is this?
- Exactly what it looks like.
What do you mean?
You mean you' re dumping me?
For what?
This plebeian lifestyle... just isn' t working for me anymore, okay?
I gotta get out of here before I kill myself.
Just listen to what I have to say, okay?
Don' t go.
I need you, baby.
Please don' t go, okay?
Here' s our man.
Yeah, all right, here' s me.
Or the guy playing me anyway, though he don' t look nothing like me.
But whatever.
So it' s a few months later, and I' m working my flunky file clerk gig at the VA hospital.
My voice still ain' t back yet.
Thank you, Harvey, dear.
Things seem like they can' t get any worse.
"Plebeian"?
Where the hell did she get that shit, man?
"Avoid the reeking herd
"Shun the polluted flock
"Live like that stoic bird
"The eagle of the rock"
- Hey, Mr. Boats.
- You know what that means, son?
Yeah, it' s from an Elinor Hoyt Wylie poem.
Excuse me.
- and do your own thing.
- No.
It means don' t compromise yourself for women.
It ain' t gonna do you no good.
Get away from them as soon as you can.
I ain' t got no woman now.
- I' m living like the stoic bird, man.
- It' s the only way to live, son.
Look at that fool there.
Probably listening to that loud rock stuff.
Junk, it' s all junk.
I don' t know.
I mean... rock music' s got some good qualities.
It isn' t jazz or nothing, but you know....
Say, when are you gonna bring me in some of those good records?
- Some Nat King Cole with strings.
- I don' t got any of that, Mr. Boats.
Yeah, you got that.
You' re keeping them at home, though.
You won' t turn loose the good stuff.
You just sell the junk.
I keep the stuff I wanna keep.
I sold a lot of good material by people that he didn' t like.
Mr. Boats didn' t like any blues or anything like that.
He played classical violin.
I started record collecting when I was 15 or 16 years old.
I started getting interested in jazz.
Prior to that, I collected comic books.
I was always a collector.
I admit to having an obsessive- compulsive quality in me.
It' s like The Treasure of the Sierra Madre or something.
You go to thrift shops and you go to the garage sales... because you think you' re gonna find something that' s real rare.
And most of time, it' s a total waste of time, but once in a while... you' il come up with something that' il whet your appetite.
In the early '60s...
I was with some buddies at a junk sale, looking for some choice sides... when I met this shy, retiring cat from Philadelphia named Bob Crumb.
You know the guy.
Fritz the Cat, Mr. Natural and all.
They made a movie about him, too.
Jay McShann.
Come on, Harv, you gonna buy that, or what?
I don' t know, Marty, it' s got a lamination crack.
A quarter.
Maybe I could talk it down.
- You are one cheap bastard, Harvey.
- I know I' m tight, man.
I live on a government wage.
You collect Jay McShann, man?
- Yeah, man, how about you?
- Yeah.
But most of my records are back in Philly.
Harvey, meet my buddy, Bob Crumb.
He just moved to town.
He' s an artist with the American Greeting Card Company.
You should see his comics, Harv.
They' re out of sight.
I' m into comics myself.
Big Yum Yum Book.
I' d never seen anything like it.
This is terrific.
I really dig your work, man.
This Peter Wheat book is by Walt Kelly.
It' s pretty rare.
- Yeah?
Can I get good bread for it?
- Not yet.
Let' s get back to your book.
What are you gonna do with it?
I haven' t really thought about it.
It' s just an exercise.
No, man.
It' s more than just an exercise.
It' s breaking ground, man.
There' s some wild shit in here, Bob.
You' re spitting on me, Harvey.
Crumb and I hung out a lot back then.
We had records and comics in common.
Check it out, man.
Pretty scary.
You don' t know the half of it, man.
Eventually, people got hip to Crumb' s artwork... and he started hanging out with the bohemian crowd.
After a while, he got sick of greeting cards and moved away to San Francisco... where he got the whole underground comic scene off the ground.
He' d come back to Cleveland every few years... and people would treat him like a celebrity.
Once, he came to visit when I was feeling real bad.
It was right after my wife left me.
like I tried to keep her captive or anything like that.
I don' t know, man.
But don' t think I' m buying any of this growth crap, man.
Everybody' s always talking about how bad experiences cause you to grow... and all that clichéd stuff.
Man, I got enough bad experiences and growth to last me plenty.
I' d be glad to trade some growth for happiness.
How long you staying in Cleveland, man?
I don' t know, I got to see this chick in New York... and I' m really busy with the comic book stuff.
It' s good bread and all.
I' m just getting sick of the whole scene.
What are you talking about?
You make a good living doing your art, right?
How many guys get that lucky in their life?
Listen, I' il tell you something.
People are starting to know the name Crumb.
When you croak, man, you' re gonna leave something behind.
Yeah, I guess.
It' s not like I' m Blind Lemon Jefferson, or Big Mama Thornton.
Come on, man.
I tell you something, it sure beats working a gig like mine... being a nobody flunky and selling records on the side for $1.
Well, that' s true.
Listen, girlie... these glasses are six for $2 because I couldn' t carry 1 2.
But I wanted 1 2.
So today, I' m buying six more.
But you should only charge me $1. 50 for them.
It' s all right.
You can ask the manager.
Frank, I need a price check.
Man, old Jewish ladies will argue forever with a cashier about anything.
These glasses....
You get behind them in line and you' re gonna wait forever.... because I couldn' t carry 1 2.
So today....
I' m a yid myself... and women in my family are like that, but I never got used to it.
I mean, I may be cheap, but I got limits, man.
Let me explain one more time.
These glasses are six for $2....
Wake up!
Your whole life' s getting eaten away with this kind of crap.
What kind of existence is this?
ls this all a working stiff like you can expect?
You gonna suffer in silence for the rest of your life, or are you gonna make a mark?
Even money, $1. 50.
And, dear....
Oh, shit!
I can write comic book stories... that are different from anything that' s been done.
I figure the guys who are doing animal comics... and superhero stuff, they' re really limited.
Because they got to try to appeal to kids.
And underground stuff like yours has been really subversive... and it' s opened things up politically... but there' s still plenty more to be done with them, too.
Pass the ketchup.
The words, the pictures, they could be more of an art form.
You know, like those French movies... or De Sica over in ltaly.
So, anyway, I tried....
I tried writing some stuff about real life... stuff that the everyman' s got to deal with.
These are all about you?
Yeah.
You' ve turned yourself into a comic hero.
Sort of, but there' s no idealized shit.
There' s no phony bullshit.
This is the real thing, man.
You know, ordinary life is pretty complex stuff.
These are really... good.
Really, you think so?
Yeah, this is great stuff.
I dig it.
Can I take them home and illustrate them?
You' d really do that for me, man?
That would be great because I can' t even draw a straight line, Bob.
What' s up with your voice, Harv?
All of a sudden, you sound fine.
I don' t know, man.
I guess you cured me.
That Bonnie, her legs go forever.
How smart is she?
I don' t know.
I guess she' s about average.
Average?
Hey, man, average is dumb.
So what if she' s dumb?
I don' t care.
"Hey, man, average is dumb."
Fuck that.
That' s all stories by yours truly.
- Hot off the presses?
- That' s right.
We have a regular Hemingway here.
No way, I don' t go in for any of that macho crap.
I didn' t know you could draw.
No, I don' t draw, doc.
I write the stories.
- Harvey, am I in here?
- You' re in there, all right?
Take it easy.
A buddy of mine and some of his friends do the art work.
Let me see this.
Mr. Boats, it' s not polite to grab things.
Next time --
It' s not bad.
Son, you done good.
But you know, I was up in Toronto a few weeks back.
I saw the Red Chinese ballet.
Now, that was beautiful.
The way those people were dancing together... those Chinese, they work hard, I tell you.
Where' s everybody going?
Where are you sick men rushing off to?
You ain' t going nowhere for now.
Probably not for a long time.
But damn if they' re not a rushing off to get there.
Harvey, how do your co- workers and friends feel about you putting them in your comics?
They love it.
They can' t get enough of it.
They come up to me demanding to know why I' m not in the new issue.
Most of them.
What about overhearing what people say?
Are you always listening at work?
Were you listening riding the bus?
- The supermarket?
- Yeah, I listen.
I fall asleep on people, too, but I listen some.
Here' s our man, eight comics later.
A brand new decade, same old bullshit.
Sure, he gets lots of recognition for his writing now.
His comics are praised by all the important media types telling people what to think.
But so what?
It' s not like he makes a living at it, like Bob Crumb.
He can' t go and quit his day job or nothing.
Who am I kidding?
Truth is, I' d be lost without my work routine.
I got a job.
Hi, Harvey.
Do you want these gourmet jelly beans?
I gave up sweets for Lent.
- Yeah, sure, I' il take them.
- I recommend the piña coladas.
They' re excellent and very authentic tasting.
It' s watermelon.
That' s pretty good.
Wait till you try the piña coladas.
Tell me something.
Can you eat lentils during Lent?
Sure, I don' t see why not.
You can' t eat meat on certain days... but lentils should be acceptable anytime.
Do you think there' s any connection between lentils and Lent?
I don' t think so.
But I' il ask Sister Mary Fred at church on Sunday.
Sister Mary Fred, huh?
ls she cute?
She sounds kind of mannish, but who the hell am I to be picky?
You' re funny.
She' s a nun.
So what?
Maybe she became a nun because she couldn' t get a guy.
She became a nun because she had a higher calling.
Higher calling?
What a crock of shit.
I don' t even know why you bother praying anyway.
I enjoy the ritual, and I' m a very spiritual person.
You know, you should try believing in something bigger than yourself.
It might cheer you up.
What, do I seem depressed?
Cut!
That was great, guys.
The bakery scene' s next.
The bakery scene' s next?
I didn' t know of a bakery scene.
Did you ever hear of a bakery scene?
Bakery is my scene, but not in that way.
Forget the bakery, let' s eat some jelly beans.
I think one might be lime.
One might be mint.
What' s the difference between this and this?
One' s cherry, one' s cinnamon.
You could tell that by just looking at them?
Not me.
I have to put it in my mouth first.
Loneliness can feel so bad.
'cause a lot of the time, it was just me and my grandmother.
I' d just be sitting in my room all day... watching television or reading books.
That was before I bought a computer, of course.
How do you cope with loneliness, Harvey?
- Did I say I watched television?
- You mentioned you watch TV... you listen to your jazz records, you read... you write, you drew your stick figures... so you could plan for your next comic book.
I' ve seen many of your stick figures.
That seems to be pretty interesting.
- Chocolate jelly beans, I' m gonna try one.
- Go ahead.
Excuse me, can I help you?
Give me... two crullers... jelly doughnut with the powdered sugar.
Thanks for coming.
- You got any of that day- old bread?
- I think so.
Here you go.
$3.
You' re Harvey Pekar?
Alice Quinn, from school.
College, yeah.
We had a couple of Lit classes together.
What happened to you?
You disappeared after two semesters.
Yeah, I know.
I got good grades and all, but there was that required Math class... hanging over my head.
Eventually, the pressure got to be too much, so....
You' re doing okay, anyway.
I heard all about your jazz reviews and your comics.
- You did?
- Sure, you' re famous.
Meanwhile, I got my degree and I' m just a plain old wife and mother.
I' m not doing as great as you think.
My second wife divorced me, I work a dead end job... as a file clerk.
Sometimes I hang out with the guys on the corner... but most of the time I just stay at home by myself and I read.
You' re luckier than you think.
Between my husband and my kids... it' s impossible for me to curl up with a good book.
I' m reading this book by Dreiser now.
- Jennie Gerhardt.
- That' s one of my favorites.
Yeah?
I hope that book don' t end like so many of those naturalist novels... with someone getting crushed to earth... by forces he can' t control.
I think you' il be pleasantly surprised.
I mean, it' s certainly not your Hollywood happy ending... but it' s pretty truthful, which is rare these days.
- This is me.
- All right.
- Nice car.
- Thanks.
- I don' t have one yet.
- Can I give you a lift somewhere?
No, that' s all right.
It' s a nice day, I' il just walk.
It was nice seeing you.
When I got home, I finished reading Jennie Gerhardt.
It was real good.
That Alice was right.
Sure, Lester, the main character, croaks in the end... but at least he' s old and dies a natural, dignified death.
I was more alone that weekend than any.
like an amputee feels a phantom limb.
All I did was think about Jennie Gerhardt and Alice Quinn... and all the decades of people I had known.
The more I thought, the more I felt like crying.
Life seemed so sweet and so sad... and so hard to let go of in the end.
But hey, man, every day is a brand new deal, right?
Just keep on working and something' s bound to turn up.
What happened to the new American Splendor?
- I think we sold them, babe.
- All of them?
Yeah.
Rand, I put one aside for myself next to the register.
I haven' t even had time to read it yet.
Sorry, Joyce, I didn' t know you were such a Splendor fan.
Next time, take it home.
Maybe I' il call the publisher.
It' il take so damn long.
Shit!
Why does everything in my life have to be such a complicated disaster?
- Okay, maybe we can call someone -- - What is this?
All right.
Okay.
I' m gonna hustle before the vibe in here gets any worse.
You can just hang.
"Dear Mr. Pekar...
"greetings from the second smallest state in the Union...
"an endless plastics and nylon plantation...
"controlled by giant chemical corporations.
"To make matters more dismal, there are no decent comic book stores in my town...
"which is why my partner and I opened one ourselves.
"Despite our steadily faltering business...
"my partner managed to sell the last copy of American Splendor Number 8...
"out from under me.
"I' m a big fan, and I hate to wait for a new order.
"Is there any way I can get it from you direct?
"Sincerely, Joyce Brabner."
She' s got good- looking handwriting.
"Dear Joyce, thanks for the...."
"Dear Joyce, thanks for the letter.
"What do you do besides selling comics?"
Anybody in the room ever done any creative writing of any sort?
"I' m a sometime activist, and I teach writing to prisoners.
"I try to help them build an interior life...
"and make art out of their monotonous, suffocating routine."
This sounds familiar.
"So you married or what?"
"I' m divorced, thank God."
Look, I think you and I got a lot in common, you know?
How am I gonna get you to come visit me in Cleveland?
- Cleveland?
- Yeah.
You think that' s a good idea?
It' s a great idea.
You should meet me because I' m a great guy.
Despite the way my comics read...
I got a lot of redeeming characteristics.
I don' t know.
Where would I stay?
I don' t know.
With me.
Don' t worry.
I' m not gonna put no moves on you.
I' m not worried about that.
Hold on, I just spilled my chamomile tea all over me.
So what are you worried about then?
It' s the way all the different artists draw you.
- What?
- I don' t really know what to expect.
Sometimes you look like a younger Brando.
But then, the way Crumb draws you... you look like a hairy ape, with all these... wavy, stinky lines undulating off your body.
I don' t really know what to expect.
No, those are motion lines.
I' m an active guy.
Look, just come out here... and I will try to be anyone that you want me to be, okay?
That' s a dangerous offer.
I' m a notorious reformer.
Are you Joyce?
- Hey, Harvey.
- Hey.
- So we finally meet in person.
- Yeah.
Look, before we get started with any of this, you might as well know I had a vasectomy.
- What' s wrong?
- Nothing.
Something' s wrong.
You keep looking around everywhere.
I guess I never imagined you' d eat in a place like this.
What, me?
No, I' ve never been here.
I thought you' d like it.
- But obviously you don' t, do you?
- No, it' s fine.
What difference does it make?
I don' t know.
None, I guess.
They got a lot of meat on this menu.
You' re a vegetarian?
Kind of, you know, I mean....
Ever since I got a pet cat...
I' ve had a lot of trouble eating animals.
I support and identify with groups like PETA... but unfortunately, I' m a self- diagnosed anemic.
Also, I have all these food allergies to vegetables... which give me serious intestinal distress.
I guess I have a lot of borderline health disorders... that limit me politically when it comes to eating.
You' re a sick woman.
Not yet, but I expect to be.
Everyone in my family has some sort of degenerative illness.
Good evening.
I was gonna clean up... but why should I give you any false notions?
The truth is, I got a serious problem with cleanliness.
lf I had to wash a dish 10 times, it' d still be dirty.
They even kicked me out of the army 'cause I couldn' t learn to make a bed.
I' ve seen worse.
Could you get me some water and a few aspirin?
What, you got a headache?
- No, but I want to avoid one.
- Yeah.
Sure is nice to have company.
You know, I mean... despite all your problems, you seem like a great person.
I' m sorry if my dating skills are a little rusty.
It' s just that I' ve been through hell and back with women.
That last one turned out to be a real nasty bitch.
- I had a nice time with you, too.
- Yeah?
You had a nice time?
Don' t make people repeat themselves.
That' s annoying.
Sorry.
Come here.
Which way is the bathroom?
Through the kitchen, on the right.
Joyce, what' s wrong?
What is it?
I don' t know.
I think that yuppie food did me in.
I feel terrible.
Let me at least do something for you.
Can I make you something?
- How about some chamomile tea?
- Chamomile tea?
What' s a guy like you doing with that?
I thought you drank soda pop for breakfast.
I just noticed you drank a lot of it when we started talking on the phone.
The girl at the food co- op... she picked me out all kinds of this herbal stuff.
Here.
Grandma Bear' s Tummy Mint or something, I think.
Hey, are you still there?
I think we should skip the whole courtship thing and just get married.
Man, am I glad I talked you into coming up here.
You know, any more time alone, I really might have lost it.
Me, too.
You don' t have any problems with moving to Cleveland?
Not really.
I find most American cities to be depressing in the same way.
And you' re okay with the vasectomy thing?
Hey, Toby.
No, you can' t have any of my White Castle hamburger... so please don' t even ask.
- Yeah?
Can I have a fry?
- Okay, but just a couple, Harvey.
I' m not going to be eating dinner until very late... and this has got to hold me over.
What have you got, a church function?
No, I' m driving to Toledo to see a movie.
Would you like to come?
No, I gotta go to Delaware tonight.
I' m getting married.
- Why Delaware?
- The chick I' m marrying is from Wilmington.
Plus, I got to help her move her stuff back here.
Why are you driving to Toledo to see a movie?
It' s not playing at the Mapletown.
- I didn' t know you had a girlfriend.
- Yeah, we met last week.
What movie could possibly be worth driving 260 miles roundtrip for?
It' s a new film called Revenge of the Nerds.
It' s about a group of nerd college students... who are being picked on all the time by the jocks.
So they decide to take revenge.
So what you' re saying is you identify with those nerds?
Yes, I consider myself a nerd... and this movie has uplifted me.
There' s this one scene where a nerd grabs the microphone during a pep rally... and announces that he is a nerd and that he is proud of it... and stands up for the rights of other nerds.
- Right on.
- Then he asks all the kids at the pep rally... who think they are nerds, to come forward.
So nearly everyone in the place does.
That' s the way the movie ends.
- So the nerds won?
- Yes.
All right.
You know, you got this movie, and I' m getting hitched.
- We both had a good month.
- Right.
- Harvey?
Wait!
- Yeah?
How long will you be in Delaware?
Because I' d like to see this movie with you.
I don' t know.
I' m gonna be gone a week.
But then, I' m gonna have a wife.
So I' m going to have to bring her along, too.
ls it a girl flick?
Depends on the girl.
What kind of girl is your new bride?
ls she a nerd?
I don' t know, man.
Maybe, yeah.
She' s into herbal tea.
I did end up becoming a character in his comics.
Harvey tends to push the negative or the sour.
And he can be very depressed, and therefore very depressing.
Harvey, do you think you portray Joyce fairly?
Yeah, I think I portray her fairly.
for obvious reasons.
I don' t wanna get my head cut off.
I think my portrayal is generally fairly accurate.
There' ve been stories that I' ve participated in... or things that have happened, and I' ve seen them... as a lot more happy things going on in there.
He just doesn' t put that in... because he just doesn' t think that sunshine and flowers sell.
ls that right?
You always say, "Misery loves company."
You know, I' m just a gloomy guy, that' s all.
It' s my perspective: gloom and doom.
And see, I thought I was marrying somebody with a sense of humor.
I guess I fooled you.
What a crock of shit, man.
- That' s not the point.
- You missed the whole point of the movie.
- That' s not the point.
- You missed the whole point of the movie.
Where the hell am I supposed to find the point in garbage?
I agree with Toby.
I think it' s a story of hope and tolerance.
Yes, it' s about time that the people who get picked on get to be the heroes.
It' s an entertaining flick and all, and I can see why you like it, Toby.
But those people on the screen ain' t even supposed to be you.
They' re college students... who live with their parents in big houses in the suburbs.
They' re gonna get degrees, get good jobs, and they' re gonna stop being nerds.
Remember what I told you about loud talking?
Use your inside voice.
Look, Toby, the guys in that movie... are not 28- year- old file clerks who live with their grandmother...
- in an ethnic ghetto.
- That' s enough.
They didn' t get their computers the way you did... by trading in a bunch of box tops and $49. 50 at the supermarket.
You' re funny, Harvey.
I' m getting in the front.
You go to the movies and daydream... but this Revenge of the Nerds ain' t reality.
It' s Hollywood bullshit.
Harvey, let him alone.
The thing that I loved about it is I was transported to another time in my life.
- I like when they took the video cameras -- - lf everyone could see it....
It' s the same as the "I Have a Dream" speech.
It' s very empowering.
Maybe I was being so harsh on Toby on account of my own problems.
You see, I wasn' t even married a month... and my old lady was already showing signs of trouble.
Granted, I tend to get married fast, 'cause I' il take any woman that' il have me.
But this time I really met my match.
How about these old 78s?
Can' t you sell them to one of your collectors?
Are you kidding me, man?
I ain' t getting rid of my 78s.
Forget it, then.
I give up.
How can I make more storage space if you won' t get rid of anything?
You know what?
I' il get rid of stuff.
- Just not my good stuff.
- Everything is your good stuff.
How am I supposed to live here if there' s no room for me?
Come on, baby.
I' il make room for you, okay?
I' m not so good at these things.
- Because you' re obsessive- compulsive.
- Come on!
I don' t wanna hear that psycho- babble crap.
I don' t care if you don' t wanna hear it.
You are the poster child for the DSM ill.
I' il have you know I come from a very dysfunctional family.
I can spot a personality disorder miles away.
Hello, Joyce.
ls Harvey home?
Borderline autistic.
Are you listening to me?
I tell you, that Toby is a spy.
Paranoid personality disorder.
Polymorphously perverse.
Hey, leave a message.
Pick up the phone.
You' re not going to believe this... but some LA producer called and wants to do a play about my life.
Call me here.
Delusions of grandeur.
See, I think comics can pretty much be an art form, man.
I mean, the pictures can be as good as they want to be... and the words can be as good as they want to be... and a man can do pretty much anything he wants to.
That' s true, but I didn' t come all the way from Delaware to talk about comics.
Where is my American splendor in a world that' s cloudy and gray?
Where life keeps passing by me day by day
Where is my American splendor in a world that' s cloudy and gray?
Where life keeps passing by me day by day
If you think reading comics about your life seems strange... try watching a play about it.
God only knows how I' il feel when I see this movie.
Things were going pretty good for a change.
Variety called me "the blue- collar Mark Twain."
Doubleday was interested in publishing an anthology of American Splendor.
I hate checking bags, man.
It always takes forever.
The bus is gonna leave soon.
That means I gotta shell out an extra $30 for a cab.
Figures.
That lucky yuppie is gonna get the bus in time.
- You know, vasectomies are reversible.
- Goddamn yuppies get everything, man.
Are you listening to me?
I said vasectomies are reversible.
What?
What are you talking about?
I don' t want no kids.
And I came clean about my vasectomy the first time I set eyes on you.
I know, but I think things have changed.
- I think we can be a family.
- Family?
Right.
What kind of family could we possibly be?
I ain' t no good with kids.
Christ, I can barely take care of myself.
I can take care of the kid and you.
No way, Joyce.
Forget it.
I can' t have no kids.
I can' t do it.
Where the hell is that Ornette Coleman album?
You know, I got a review due tomorrow.
I didn' t touch it, Harvey.
Would you please let me sleep?
Come on, it' s 1: 00.
How late can a person sleep, man?
It happens to be Saturday, you selfish son of a bitch.
That don' t make no difference.
- Don' t tell me what to do.
- I' m not telling you what to do.
I' m the one who moved into your city, into your home... into your vasectomy... into your whole screwed- up life.
The least you could do is allow me to live here in my own way.
I tried everything... but nothing could get this woman out of bed.
I mean, she wouldn' t get a job, wouldn' t go out... wouldn' t make friends, nothing.
Joyce diagnosed herself as clinically depressed.
I didn' t know what the hell she was going through... but it was sure taking its toll on me.
Joyce, we got a message here.
How come you didn' t....
Useless, man.
Hi.
This is a message for Harvey Pekar.
My name is Jonathan Greene... and I' m a producer of Late Night with David Letterman.
We want to talk to you about coming on the show to plug your comics.
Please give us a call at 212- 555- 3333.
Thanks.
Joyce finally got off the futon.
No.
Come on, who the hell cares?
- Jesus Christ.
- Give that to me.
What the hell are you doing?
Merchandising.
- People like this show?
- Yeah.
I can' t believe my voice is going.
What' s the matter?
You were fine in the hotel.
You want something to drink?
I' m hungry.
Aren' t you hungry?
They should give you doughnuts or something.
Look at this.
- Dave' s ready for you now.
- He is?
You got something to eat?
'Cause my stomach is growling.
- There' s no time to eat.
- Come on.
Wait, what about the doll?
He' s got it at the desk.
Would you relax about that?
- Guys, we' re in a hurry.
- Okay.
- Which way?
- Right this way.
Thank you, boys.
Our next guest tonight works as a file clerk at a Cleveland hospital.
He also writes comic books which deal with his day- to- day pains and pleasures.
This is an anthology of the nine of those comics.
It' s entitled American Splendor.
From off the streets of Cleveland, folks, please say hello to Harvey Pekar.
Harvey, come out here.
Hi, Harvey.
Thanks for coming out here.
Have a seat.
What do you mean calling me "curious"?
I met you before the show.
- I meant "curious" in a fascinating way.
- All right.
A man who has the presence of one who is quite fascinating.
'Cause I met you before the show.
I thought you were a pretty nice guy.
I thought, wait a minute, I might be nursing a viper in my bosom.
Something like that.
You' re a little defensive about this?
Yeah, I' m waiting for those Cleveland jokes.
Go ahead.
- All right, settle down.
- Yeah, all right.
Let' s explain to folks who may not be familiar with your work... what it is you do here exactly.
You have comic books about you in your daily life.
And you also have a regular job in Cleveland working at a hospital.
That' s right.
- You know this guy?
- I' m beginning to wonder.
You could probably get by on what you make selling your work.
Because people want you to write more, and you' re publishing this anthology.
Who?
What people?
What are you talking about?
- Where the hell do you get that stuff?
- I know that you....
You know, that --
I' m no show- biz phony.
I' m telling the truth.
Go on, man.
You can' t....
- At least he' s keeping up with Letterman.
- Pandering is more like it.
You mean to tell me that other people haven' t contacted you for writing literary....
- I mean -- - You could making a living as a writer.
What are you trying to do over there?
I' m trying to get some news.
There' s a big story about to break... about the US selling arms to lran and the Contras.
- Just relax.
- Don' t worry about it.
Finally, something good.
Watch this.
- I got a job.
- I know you' ve got a job.
I' ve got a job.
We both have jobs.
- Then what' s the matter?
- Joke, man.
- We gotta go.
Harvey, I like you.
I' m on your side.
I enjoy the comic books.
- Quickly, tell us about the little doll.
- My wife made it.
- Am I giving you a hard time?
- Am I making you nervous?
- No.
We have to go now.
I wanted to mention these are for sale.
- They' re made out of your old clothing.
- Right.
- What do these go for? - $34.
- $34 for this?
- What are you, cheaper than me?
- Would you pay $34 for that?
- No, but I' m not asking it.
My wife is.
Such brilliant repartee.
Shit.
So, what do you think?
Megalomaniac.
Hi, this is a message for Harvey Pekar.
From the streets of Cleveland, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome... the one, the only Harvey Pekar.
Harvey, come on out, buddy.
It became clear pretty fast that I was invited on the show just for laughs.
You look like a lot of guys you see sleeping on buses.
- Sorry.
- It' s all right, Dave, have a good time.
- I know, we' re doing what we can.
- It' s your world.
I' m just living in it.
But what the hell did I care?
Letterman was an okay guy.
Let him take potshots at me.
So long as I got paid and got to plug my comics.
I think to myself, you look like every police artist sketch I' ve ever seen.
Funny thing is... something about me and Letterman clicked for the viewers.
He kept wanting me back.
- It was about a year ago, this month -- - That' s right.
No, last month.
A year ago, last month, you made your first appearance on the show.
- What has happened to you since?
- Not much, David.
It' s slow going.
I still have the same job.
But see, Harvey, you' re the embodiment of the American Dream.
And it wasn' t just me getting all the attention.
Action.
Are these free?
As a result of my appearances on Letterman... my buddy Toby Radloff, landed a gig extolling the virtues of MTV.
Watch where you' re going.
- All right, you fucking yuppie freak.
- Who the fuck is this on my set?
Look at this, the man of the hour.
This is my new do for the MTV generation.
We came upon Toby Radloff while doing a story in Cleveland last year... on his friend, the comic artist Harvey Pekar.
Toby' s a genuine nerd, and he doesn' t care if you have a problem with that.
Hi, my name is Toby Radloff, a genuine nerd from Cleveland, Ohio.
And as you know, many hip people... including a lot of college students, are going to be heading for spring break.
But I have decided to spend my own personal spring break... right here in beautiful Cleveland, Ohio.
That day, I had an epiphany.
It seemed that real salt- of- the- earth people, like Toby and me... were getting co- opted by these huge corporations.
We were getting held up and ridiculed as losers in the system.
This is Toby Radloff, genuine spring- break party nerd... signing off.
What can I say?
It was the '80s, man.
Harvey, are you listening to me?
I' ve been reading about these kids who grew up in these war zones.
These kids are amazing --
You' re that guy from the Letterman show, right?
Yeah, that' s me.
That' s so excellent.
You and Stupid Pet Tricks are a riot.
Yeah?
Then how about you buy one of my comics, man?
That' s the only reason I go on that dumb show, anyway.
Right.
Sure.
Later, Harvey Pekar.
- What an asshole!
- I want to write a political comic book... about these kids.
Listen to me.
There' s a conference in Jerusalem in a couple of weeks.
I' m gonna start by doing some interviews there.
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about, Jerusalem?
Lately I can barely drag you off the futon to go with me to the Letterman show.
Do you want to know why?
Because I don' t give a damn about the Letterman show.
I want to do something important to me, something that matters.
You know I only go on the show for the extra bread.
Maybe if you got your lazy ass up, and got yourself a job...
I could do something that matters, too.
- Harvey, you' re yelling.
- You ever think of that?
Don' t....
I' m sorry.
Joyce, I' m sorry.
I guess it was good to finally see Joyce excited about something of her own.
This is crazy.
Can' t you just do something here in Cleveland?
You' il survive a couple of weeks by yourself.
All right.
Be careful out there, all right?
I love you.
Sure, I was happy for her, but I was still upset for me.
It was later that night when I first found the lump.
I was determined to put it out of my mind until Joyce got back.
Easier said than done.
What do I care?
Just give me the chart.
- What is your problem?
- Miguel, look...
I just don' t want to keep coming back here for it, okay?
Harvey, that patient' s due to be admitted a week from now.
- Why do you always fight?
- How often must we go through this?
Just give me the fucking chart!
- We' il see what the doctor has to say.
- Fine.
What?
What do you mean, another two weeks?
Jesus Christ.
You' ve got to come home sometime!
Hello?
Goddamn it.
Just walk straight out to the desk.
I know.
Okay, fine.
- You all set?
- Yeah.
I was starting to lose it.
Between the lump, the loneliness, I felt like everything was closing in on me.
I never felt more like a sell- out hack in my life.
Okay.
You know, folks, if it really is true that misery loves company... our next guest must always have a house full of people.
Okay, asshole.
You' re gonna pay for that one, man.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back Harvey Pekar.
Harvey, this is not the forum.
This is not Meet The Press.
You just want me to talk about simple- minded bullshit, David.
- I ain' t co- opted like you.
I got things to say.
- Relax, Harvey.
For instance, I want to talk about a conflict of interest situation.
Can we do that, David?
How about that?
You know, like GE owning this network, NBC.
GE has basically become a military, industrial, financial --
Can we get the singing shitzu back here?
Has he left the building yet?
You think NBC news is gonna cover what they do fairly?
- I got other things I wanna talk about.
- That' s enough --
Just shut up, man!
Don' t push me.
- I' m doing my own thing.
- Harvey, this is not --
Are you afraid of the truth, David?
It' s not about what you' re saying.
It' s about your choice of venue.
It may come as a shock to you, but this is a comedy show.
- Not tonight, it ain' t.
- Joe, come check this out.
Take your winning personality and go get your own show.
- I don' t want my own goddamn show.
- We' ve had you on this show many times.
You sulk, complain, and promote your comic book... and you really haven' t been appreciative.
You didn' t do me any favors, okay?
I' m still a file clerk.
I' ve always been a file clerk... and it' s no thanks to you or to your goddamn pathetic audience.
We' re gonna take a commercial.
And when we come back, guess who' s not gonna be here.
You want me to leave, David?
Come on, ask me like a man.
- Don' t go hiding behind a commercial.
- Are things okay at home, Harvey?
Things are just great at home.
Okay, goodbye, Dave.
Goodbye, America, and thanks for nothing.
Harvey Pekar, ladies and gentlemen.
We' il be right back.
- I guess you really did it this time.
- Who the hell cares?
That show wasn' t helping my sales anyway.
Baby... please don' t go away anymore.
I just can' t take being alone, you know?
lf you met those kids over there, you wouldn' t ask that of me.
I' m telling you something... if you go away again, I' m gonna lose it.
This is not up for discussion.
I need this in my life right now.
I do appreciate the fact that you missed me so much, baby.
Harvey, what is that?
I don' t understand.
Does "tumor" mean the same thing as "cancer"?
We know the growth is malignant.
What we don' t know is how far it may have spread.
Once we have the results, we can make informed decisions about treatment.
Cancer.
Diagnosis.
MRl.
Cancer.
How can I have cancer?
- I don' t feel sick at all.
- That' s a positive thing.
My cousin Norman died of lymphoma.
He was a brilliant oncologist.
Stop it!
You' re not gonna die, Harvey.
You' re not.
What' s gonna happen to you, baby?
Who' s gonna take care of you --
Look at me and focus.
We are gonna get through this.
I understand illness.
I know how to handle these things.
Yeah, but that' s you, you know?
I' m not strong enough.
I don' t know how to be positive.
I can' t do that.
I can' t do it.
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can' t.
I' il tell you how.
You' il make a comic book of the whole thing.
You' il document every detail.
And that way, you' il remove yourself from the experience until it' s over.
I can' t do that.
I' m just not strong enough.
Man, I just wanna die.
That' s fine.
I' il do it without you.
I' m Fred.
You called me about the comic book.
Right, the artist.
Come in.
This is my daughter, Danielle.
I had to bring her along.
I hope you don' t mind.
Hi, Danielle.
What' s that you' re holding?
A pony.
A pony?
What' s his name?
She' s a girl.
Clarissa.
Oh, I see.
I' m Joyce, and I' m very pleased to meet both you and Clarissa.
I' m real sorry to hear about Harvey.
ls he here?
He' s going to work till next week when he starts the chemo.
That' s why I want this project started... because once he' s stuck here, I know he' il take over.
Shit.
Fucking idiot.
Hey, Joyce, open the door.
I forgot my keys again.
Hold the door.
Open the fucking door, man!
- Hey, Harvey.
- Fred.
What' s going on, man?
You see, I thought it was a great idea.
Joyce said if we try to just follow you through your treatments....
She thought it was a good idea, too, didn' t she?
Here' s some of the ideas we' ve been batting around.
All right.
Jesus.
Joyce has no idea what she' s doing, man.
There' s too many words in these frames.
When are you coming back, Fred?
She said something about next Tuesday, which is fine with me.
The only thing is, I might have the kid again.
My ex- wife is supposed to take her, but I don' t have much faith in her showing up.
She' s in worse shape than me these days.
Next week... my treatment begins.
Do me a favor, man.
Bring the kid, will you?
Thanks.
I wanna die.
- Joyce.
- What?
What' s wrong, Harvey?
What are you doing up?
What is it?
Tell me the truth.
Am I a guy who writes about himself... in a comic book?
Or am I just a character in that book?
What are you talking about?
What are you saying?
lf I die, will that character keep going?
Or will he just fade away?
Oh, my God.
Harvey, wake up.
Wake up, Harvey.
Come on.
Oh, no.
Come on, wake up.
Can you hear me?
My name is Harvey Pekar.
That' s an unusual name:
Harvey Pekar.
1960 was the year I got my first apartment and my first phone book.
Now, imagine my surprise when I looked up my name... and saw that in addition to me, another Harvey Pekar was listed.
You know, I was listed as Harvey L. Pekar.
My middle name is Lawrence.
He was listed as Harvey Pekar.
Therefore, his was a pure listing.
I noticed that a third Harvey Pekar was listed in the phone book.
Now, this filled me with curiosity.
let alone in one city?
Then one day... a person I work with expressed her sympathy to me... concerning what she thought was the death of my father.
She pointed out an obituary notice in the newspaper... for a man named Harvey Pekar.
And one of his sons was named Harvey.
These were the other Harvey Pekars.
And six months later, Harvey Pekar, Jr. died.
I was filled with sadness.
"What were they like?" I thought.
It seemed our lives had been linked in some indefinable way.
But the story does not end there.
For two years later, another Harvey Pekar appeared in the phone book.
Who are these people?
Where do they come from?
What do they do?
What' s in a name?
Who is Harvey Pekar?
We' ve got T- shirts for sale upstairs, if you' re interested.
Here' s our man, a year later.
Somehow I made it through the treatments, and the doctors are optimistic.
I guess Joyce was right about doing a big comic book.
We published the thing as a graphic novel, our first collaboration... and ended up with rave reviews.
We even won a couple of National Book Awards.
Go figure.
Those are beautiful.
Did you find this in there?
I didn' t even see those.
Ever seen one of these flowers?
Are you finished?
Danielle, I love it.
Very expressive colors.
What is it, Harvey?
That was the doctor.
He says I' m all clear.
The weirdest thing that came out of my illness was Danielle.
With her real mother running around who knows where... and seeing how well her and Joyce got on...
Fred decided she' d have a better life with us.
I was scared at first, but then I thought, what the hell.
She' s a good kid.
Hi, Harvey.
So we ended up taking her and raising her as our own.
- You keep reading them backwards.
- I like reading them backwards.
ls that one you?
I keep telling you, all of them' s me, man.
You look like a monster.
Wait till you see what you' re gonna look like.
- Me?
- Yeah, you' re part of the story, too, now.
What story?
The story of my life.
I know I' m not as interesting as The Little Mermaid and all that magical crap --
I think I' m gonna write my own comic.
- Yeah?
What about?
- I' m not sure yet.
But not about you.
I think you have enough already.
You should write about things in your own life.
You know, like school... and ponies.
Girl stuff.
Do you have to hold my hand?
What are you, embarrassed of me?
I know, I' m embarrassing.
I felt the same way about my father.
No.
It' s just, when you hold my hand, you squeeze it too hard.
Go on.
Joyce is right.
You are obsessive- compulsive.
Go on.
Yeah, so I guess comics brought me to life.
But don' t think this is some sunny, happy ending.
Every day is still a major struggle.
Joyce and I fight like crazy.
And she barely works.
The kid' s got ADD and is a real handful.
My life is total chaos.
With a little luck, I' il get a window of good health between retiring and dying.
The golden years, right?
Who knows?
I should be able to swing something.
Sure, I' il lose the war eventually.
But the goal is to win a few skirmishes along the way, right?
Surprise!
For he' s a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny
Surprise.
Here I am!
Who' s this?
Look at that.
Watch that ladder.
What happened?
Let me try something here.
What is it?
What' s gone wrong here, then?
Won' t work, huh?
Here we go.
What are you guys looking at?
Get me out of here!
Here!
It' s mine!
Do you mind?
- Taxi!
- Taxi!
Taxi!
Come on.
Jacques!
Jacques, you' re late!
I' m late.
I have to mow Mrs. Oglethorpe' s lawn.
Stop that!
Stop that!
Stop that!
You moron.
There will be changes around here after today, and I will personally see that you will be the first one to go.
- Allow me.
- Wipe off those filthy hands!
- Take this.
- Oh, for me?
Carry it to the house, you idiot!
Here you are, my dear.
Do come in, Edmund.
My dear Lillian.
I' m so sorry I' m late, but there' s so much to do in handling the Oglethorpe enterprises now that dear Oscar has passed on.
You are a good friend, Edmund.
And such a comfort in my time of need.
I hope more than a friend, Lillian.
I have been entrusted with the last will and testament of Oscar Winterhaven Oglethorpe.
- Edmund, I beg your pardon.
- Yes, dear lady?
I must apologize, but we really must wait for my personal solicitor, Roland T. Flakfizer.
- Jacques.
I' ve been employed by your late husband for over 1 3 years.
- Are you dismissing me?
- Good heavens, no, Edmund.
I was involved in a minor accident with the Bentley last year.
Miraculously, he was by my side to assist me.
Oh, Jacques, I want you to go to this address and summon this gentleman at once.
I' ve been calling all morning and leaving messages.
- I can' t seem to reach him.
- Yes, Mrs. O...
Lillian, how long must we wait?
I can assure you, once Mr. Flakfizer receives my message, he will race to be by my side.
Anyone hurt?
Roland T. Flakfizer, attorney at law.
- I specialize in accident cases.
- We' re both fine.
I know what I' m doing, I know what I' m doing.
You wouldn' t happen to have any french fries on you, would you?
All right, all right.
Step back, step back.
I' ve got injured clients here.
Sir, you have caused grievous harm to my clients and their vehicle.
And through your negligence, this child has suffered severe neck injuries.
- Leave me alone.
- Stick with me, kid, and you can afford enough Nintendo software to sink a battleship.
- I can sue my parents?
- I sued mine.
- My neck!
God bless them.
You shouldn' t be walking in your condition.
This woman is with child.
If any harm came to this infant, by God, sir, you will feel my wrath in court.
- What are you talking about?
- Don' t try to weasel out of this.
Dozens of witnesses saw your reckless driving.
How many of you saw this man carelessly, and without regard for life and property, careen into my clients at almost 85 miles per hour?
Miss lnternational Wet T- shirt champion, nymphomaniac secretary?
Right here!
Hey, hey!
Flakfizer' s at it again, I see.
- Check for outstanding...
- Roland T. Flakfizer?
That' s him.
Thank you very much.
You agree with me, I agree with you.
Hold that thought.
I swear, I never touched your daughter.
Taxi!
Here we go.
Get in.
Get in.
- Where to?
- Any place with no extradition laws.
- And step on it.
- Right.
- Mr. Roland T. Flakfizer?
- That depends.
- Do I owe you money?
- No.
In a drunken stupor, did I promise to marry you?
- No.
- Then I' m your man.
- Lillian Oglethorpe wants to see you.
In her mid- 50s, with possible gusts up to 60, 65?
Can you come right away?
- Is she still rich?
By all means.
The Oglethorpe place.
Yeah, you settle back, I' il get you there safe and sound.
One- way street.
Don' t worry, this happens a lot.
You enjoy driving a cab?
No.
As soon as I get me driver' s license, I' m quitting.
A guy' s really gotta haul rump to make ends meet these days.
I mean, apart from the cab, I' m a pool man, I perform liposuction,
I got me own toupee business.
My motto:
"Something that size should have hair on it."
Aren' t those numbers clicking by awfully fast?
- You' re probably a speed- reader.
- Well, you got me there.
Another two miles and we own this cab.
- I hope you brought money.
- Oh, sure.
I have a wallet just like that.
Hey, that is my wallet.
When I get some money, this could come in handy.
Stealing another man' s wallet.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- I don' t believe it.
You!
- What are you doing?
- Do you know who I am?
A psychotic cab driver?
I' m Rocco Melonchek.
I hope you know you' re blowing any possible tip.
You were my attorney in my divorce case...... until you started dating my wife during the trial.
And you got the court to double the alimony request she originally made.
You didn' t want her to keep seeing me in cheap motels, did you?
For God' s sake, man, she was your wife!
- Help me.
- Get off.
All right, all right, all right.
Five- minute break.
All right, break' s over.
You' re a businessman.
- Let' s talk business.
- Fine, and then I' il kill you.
I thought I recognized you.
I' ve been looking for you for the past three years.
- You' re lying.
- Of course I am, but hear me out.
Clients are impressed by a law firm with a big staff.
The more employees, the bigger the fees.
So I could use a man like you in my organization.
Travel, excitement and a chance for advancement.
But work hard and in no time you' il move up to next- to- the- bottom rung.
- You got a dental plan?
- Lose a tooth, you get two free.
- What' s my job?
- You can be my chauffeur.
- How much?
- Two hundred bucks a week.
- 600.
- 300.
- 400.
- 800.
- 900.
Shouldn' t I be in this negotiation somewhere?
- 350 and not a penny more.
- I' il take it.
- What happened to 1000?
- I allowed for taxes.
- I want four weeks in advance.
- Five weeks.
Hold it.
I' m giving you one minute to stop this.
- Two minutes.
- Five minutes.
- Seven minutes.
- Nine minutes.
I' ve stepped into my own private hell.
We' d better get going.
The faster we get to Lillian, the quicker I can afford your salaries.
For 350 bucks a week, you drive.
Lillian, we really can' t wait any longer.
I suppose you' re right, Edmund.
I can' t imagine what is keeping Roland.
- You guys wait here.
- Hey, you' re the boss.
The reading of the last will and testament...... of Oscar Winterhaven Oglethorpe.
- Roland!
- Please, call me what everyone else calls me:
"Your Royal Sex Machine."
I wouldn' t come without bringing you a terribly expensive gift.
I hope you like it.
It reminds me of you.
Roland, how thoughtful of you.
But I believe I have one just like it.
I' il take it back and get the money.
Mrs. Oglethorpe, you look wonderful.
I could make love to you right here and now.
Roland, please.
Let' s keep this on a professional level.
Very well, then.
I' il charge you 50 bucks a pop.
Mr. Oglethorpe!
How well I remember him.
Gone now, but not forgotten.
I was never crazy about his taste in clothes.
I hope this speech doesn' t seem like a rambling affair, which is something I' m sure we' il be involved in.
Oh, Lillian, you make me feel just like a natural woman.
I' ve heard enough.
- Sir, I am appalled.
- Lillian, who is this man?
Roland, this is Mr. Edmund Lazlo.
A likely story.
Just look at him.
He' s obviously after your money and social standing, but I was here first.
Hey, how is everyone?
- Have you got any mustard in here?
- Hey, I' m the boss, remember?
- I told you to wait outside.
- Today' s my day off.
And just who are you?
He' s a member of my staff.
Lillian Oglethorpe, Rocco Melonchek.
Rocco Melonchek, Lillian Oglethorpe.
In order to tell you two apart, one of you will have to wear a mustache.
Nice to meet someone else who buys their clothes at big- and- tall- man shops.
- I beg your pardon?
- Why?
You can' t help it.
Refreshments.
Good idea, Jacques.
He was so devoted to my husband.
Darling Oscar is dead now, you know.
Well, I hope so.
I understand they buried him.
- Just make yourself feel at home.
I really do believe we should begin.
Oh, yes, yes, certainly.
Will you all please find yourselves a seat?
Oh, I beg your...
The last will and testament of Oscar Winterhaven Oglethorpe.
- Do you have a bathroom?
- I protest!
This is most irregular!
- Lillian...
- Edmund!
Please be careful.
This man is in obviously no condition to carry on.
Rocco, will you continue?
- Lillian, I...
- Right, let' s cut to the payoff here.
Yacht...
"To my gay lover, I leave --"
It was a joke.
I was just joking.
Yes, here we are.
"All my worldly goods to be transferred into the care of my wife, Lillian."
- Darling.
- "And because of my love for the arts, I request that half my fortune be used to establish a ballet company."
Wonderful.
Nothing like the thrill of spending an evening watching a bunch of anorexics leaping around, guys with bulging genitals...
I hope I' m not arousing you.
This is all very well and good, but I wouldn' t know the first thing
- about running such a company.
- Mrs. Oglethorpe...
-... as your trusted lawyer...
- You can use those words together?... and friend...... I naturally assumed that task would fall to me.
Why would anyone wanna be the head of a ballet company?
"And the director of the company shall receive $500, 000 a year salary."
I' il take the job.
I have ballet running through my veins.
Lillian, I' m your man!
Outrageous!
I doubt whether he knows the difference between the first, second, third, fourth or fifth positions!
Hey, he is strictly missionary position.
I will not allow a rogue like you to handle the Oglethorpe Ballet.
This document should be treated with the dignity and respect it deserves.
This is no time for family pictures.
I gather these for those less fortunate than ourselves who can' t afford pornography.
Edmund!
I demand this man be dismissed immediately!
- Jacques, you' re working for me now.
- For what reason?
- Does it make you angry?
- Yes!
That' s a good enough reason for me.
Lillian, I have a dream.
We' il bring in a whole new breed of ballet- goers with innovative giveaways.
Leotard nights, wet tutu competitions.
We' il have the ballerinas wear wooden shoes.
Mrs. Oglethorpe, this man doesn' t know what he' s talking about.
Now, leave this matter to me and I will sign for you the world' s premier dancer, The Great Volare.
Volare?
How wonderful.
Wait a second!
Uno pari- mutuel.
Not the Volare!
You know The Great Volare?
I knew him back when he was known as the Pretty Good Volare.
We served in the Army together.
He owes me one.
I threw myself on top of an 1 8- year- old Vietnamese girl and saved his life.
- Nonsense!
- That' s where you' re wrong.
This is nonsense.
Lillian, I am the only one who can bring you the world' s greatest male ballerina.
For myself, I ask only a nominal salary, plus a cut of gross receipts, a bonus of 25 percent on anything above break- even, a $300 per diem, the use of a company car and housing.
By all means, make my husband' s dream come true.
What, you want him to marry a cheerleader?
Oh, this is so exciting.
I can see I am no longer required as the family lawyer.
Look, I' m thinking of becoming a lawyer.
- Can I buy your diploma off you?
- Good heavens.
I need you both.
Very well, Lillian.
As you wish.
- For now.
- Then this evening I' m off to the ballet.
I must shave, shower, get new clothes and practice signing your name.
I bid you all a fondue.
If you should lose this hand in an industrial accident, keep it for me.
Gentlemen!
Alan.
I brought this for you.
It' s not exactly a bouquet, but it' s a start.
So sweet.
Were you watching the ballet again tonight?
I love to watch you dance.
Someday we' re gonna be on that stage dancing together.
At the rate I' m going, I' m not so sure.
Alan, don' t talk that way.
We agreed that if one of us got into a major company, it could only help the both of us.
Tonight I' m going to talk to Volare about you.
I would love that.
I mean, no one dances like The Great Volare.
Except you.
Catch.
Tickets, please?
No smoking in the theater.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
Please.
- Five and six.
- Eleven.
Now it' s your turn:
25 and 67.
Miss!
These seats are dreadful.
They' re facing the stage.
Hey, did we miss the coming attractions?
Who' s the bad guy?
Is Tom Cruise in this?
Do you work out?
- I' m looking for The Great Volare.
- He' s on- stage.
And he doesn' t appreciate visitors backstage.
No, no, no, I' m not a visitor.
This is strictly business.
No.
She' s quite delightful, thank you.
Ok, I give up.
How come he doesn' t throw up?
Bravo, Mr. Volare.
They love you.
That audience wouldn' t know a ballet from a bullfight.
And who are you to speak to me?
Where is my towel?
When I come off- stage, I expect my towel immediately.
- Do you understand me?
- I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
Fire him.
Tina, darling, you were marvelous.
Perhaps we should meet in my dressing room after the performance and discuss your career.
I' d like that very much, Mr. Volare.
- Thank you.
- Lisa!
Darling, I thought we' d have dinner tonight after the closing- night party.
Oh, well, thank you, but I' m afraid I' ve already made plans.
Mr. Volare, I' d like you to meet my friend Alan Grant.
It' s a privilege to meet you, Mr. Volare.
I' m a huge fan of yours.
Well, Alan' s a dancer too, with the Performing Artists Group, the nonprofit ballet troupe.
Really?
How sweet.
It' s a fine idea to keep busy until one is good enough to command a salary.
My cue.
- She looked 1 8, officer, I swear!
- Too noisy around here.
I got twice the sleep at a Julio lglesias concert.
Let' s go back, wait for him, sign him up.
Excuse me.
We have to get this plutonium back to the lab.
- Jacques.
- Hey.
- You know him?
- Sure.
He used to drive Mr. Oglethorpe to the theater,
- then I' d sneak him into the ballet.
- I' m gonna be the best man
- at their wedding.
- I hope so.
Excuse me, we didn' t get your name.
Oh, my name' s Rocco Melonchek.
I' m the ballet world' s up- and- coming manager/ agent.
I' m here to sign a contract with The Great Volare.
I hate to burst your bubble, but Volare already has an agent and manager.
That' s too bad.
Any of them real sick?
A young, fresh face.
- Alan Grant.
- Exactly.
- I got it right.
- There' s my cue.
Jacques, convince Mr. Melonchek Alan' s the person he' s looking for.
Could he make millions?
Ieaving his manager with everything else?
Sure he would.
Wouldn' t you, Alan?
Alan?
Can' t you see he' s watching the woman he adores?
- You' re in love with her, aren' t you?
- You bet.
- When' s the wedding?
- There won' t be one...... unless I can find a job dancing.
To tell you the truth, Mr. Melonchek, I' m about out of money and I' m gonna have to go back to Minneapolis.
I' il tell you what.
Don' t you buy that plane ticket just yet, because I am gonna get you an audition with Roland T. Flakfizer, ballet director.
- You could do that?
They' re like this.
Well, let' s go to work, Mr. Melonchek.
I now pronounce us dancer and manager.
Yeah!
Come in.
Tina, darling.
I' m so glad you' ve come.
You were most inspiring tonight.
I can see that under my guidance, your career will soar.
Already I can hear the audience roar.
- Who are you?
- Roland T. Flakfizer, managing director of the Oglethorpe- Flakfizer Ballet Company.
You wouldn' t happen to have a plunger on you, would you?
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, I see you have a pretty visitor.
I' il get a girl and we' il double.
- You got five minutes, Mr. Volare.
- Five minutes?
My God!
Have you consulted another doctor?
- You are out of line.
- And you are out of toilet paper.
- But we' re still short one girl.
- What are you doing here?
- To sign you for my ballet company.
- To sign me for your ballet company?
Swear to God, I just said that.
Why don' t you run along and let us men talk business.
Just leave your phone number and favorite color with the manager and later we' il talk business.
- You' re cute, Mr...?
- Garvey.
Steve Garvey.
I think we have something beautiful, you and l.
Someday you' il have my children.
In fact, they' re out in the car, if you want them.
Oh, God...
You' re still here?
I will have you thrown out of the theater.
- First, we talk ballet.
- I know nothing of your ballet.
I' m managing director and I don' t either.
Look, I don' t dance for just anyone.
I am ballet.
My dance shoes are in the Louvre in Paris.
Last year, I left a raincoat in Cleveland.
Do you realize what I was doing at the age of 7?
I can imagine.
You must be thankful you didn' t go blind.
I was dancing professionally.
Well, whatever you call it: flogging the carrot, polishing the cue stick, choking the chicken, clearing the snorkel...
But I didn' t come back here to rehash good times.
Volare, dance with the Oglethorpe- Flakfizer Ballet Company and you can name your price.
Money is no object.
It isn' t mine.
Look, I' m offering you a check for $500, 000.
It' s made out to Volare, Great, The.
I don' t dance for the money.
Then you dance and I' il keep the money.
Look, I will not dance for your ballet and that is final.
A Flakfizer doesn' t know the meaning of the word "no."
And we' re a little fuzzy on the word "panagglutinin" and "viscosity."
All right, all right.
The same money,
- we throw in a girl.
- No!
Then would you object to me getting one?
I' m a lonely man, Mr. Volare.
I will give you till the count of ten to get out of here.
- One, two, three -- - Before you get stuck somewhere around six, I' il go.
Because I don' t do those kind of things.
And for the last time, I warn you about that highly contagious rash.
I beg you to see to it at once.
Hygiene, Mr. Volare.
Hygiene.
- Mr. Flakfizer.
- Where?!
I' m sorry, I thought my father showed up.
Did Volare accept your offer?
I didn' t know the meaning of the word "no," but he had it down pretty good.
You wouldn' t happen to have a world- famous dancer stuffed in a drawer somewhere, would you?
His name' s Alan Grant.
He can dance rings around Volare.
He' s even more talented than Gorbachev.
- Gesundheit.
- Baryshnikov.
- God bless you.
- Baryshnikov.
How' s it going?
How you doing?
You look very nice today.
He' s one of the best dancers in the country.
Hire him for the ballet.
What do you say?
No, no, nay, nyet.
I have to find some way to sign Volare.
When I do that, I' m director of the ballet.
And, gentlemen, that spells cash with a capital...
- K.
- You should go back to school.
I hated teaching.
- Flakfizer, I thought you were smart.
I said no to you, didn' t l?
I' m offering you two incomes.
Your paycheck from the ballet company and then when you sign Alan Grant to dance, another hefty check as part of Alan' s management team.
How do we get this past Mrs. Oglethorpe?
After she sees Alan dance, you' ve got nothing to worry about.
Except for taxes, depletion of the ozone layer and diseases due to any sexual contact.
- That' s a load off my mind.
- All you gotta do is convince Mrs. Oglethorpe to let Alan into the charity bazaar.
Are you kidding?
I can charm the pants off of her.
Now, that is a disgusting thought.
Gentlemen, you' re gonna have to sneak him in.
Not so fast.
You know, I worry about you, I really do.
We need a contract.
A binding document, with plenty of loopholes.
Exactly.
Jacques, draw up the standard contract, would you, please?
Hello, Jacques.
We' ve got years to go before we even come close to the Japanese.
Sign that.
- This paper' s blank.
- I' il fill it in later.
Fair enough.
You' re not gonna cheat me or anything?
I give you my word as a gentleman.
Well, you had me until then.
All right, all right.
Fifty- fifty split.
- Now, this is more like it.
- What about me?
To show you no favoritism, Rocco and I
- will also split your salary fifty- fifty.
- Thanks.
That should keep you out of a higher income bracket.
Come to think of it, that should keep you out of any income bracket.
Rocco, Jacques, tomorrow, Alan Grant joins the Oglethorpe Ballet Company.
Ladies and gentlemen...... welcome to the Ninth Annual Oglethorpe Charity Festival.
- Let' s go.
- It gives me great pleasure to announce the Oglethorpe Ballet Company will be leaving for New York tomorrow, where we...
Be ready in ten minutes.
- T en minutes?
We' il be ready.
- And you' re gonna be a star.
You know, if you keep this up, I may even start to believe it.
Nice to have a chance to make someone' s wish come true.
That' s a nice thing to do.
Well, how did the market close?
Well, roll over my amalgamated, split my utilities and double my capital venture overlays.
Now, call me in an hour and tell me what the hell I' m talking about.
Pull over.
Everybody all set?
We' ve got everything so under control, it' s pathetic.
- And so is he.
- Good.
Driver, drive on.
Look out for that truck!
- Buffy...
- Lillian.
Get this thing up on the rack and have it overhauled.
Better yet, why don' t you get up on the rack and I' il see you in an hour.
Avanti!
There you are.
- Darling.
- Have you come to see Mommy?
What a charming little animal.
Do you know dogs, Mr. Melonchek?
I used to be a chef in a Korean restaurant.
Good food, good friends, good conversation.
Roland, I' m so upset Volare turned us down.
What a slap in our collective faces.
Like I told you, he has no respect for our ballet.
I wouldn' t want a man like that dancing for me.
- Or with me, for that matter.
- I offered him half the moon.
I keep asking myself, "Why didn' t he sign with us?"
Because he said he wouldn' t work with you if you were the last person on earth.
- What was that?
- Nothing.
Fetch.
My darling Lillian, Volare has shunned us.
Hold your chins up high, for I have discovered a fabulous young dancer.
- A talent that soars.
- Volare.
It' s Volare!
Oh, good heavens.
It' s him.
- It' s Volare.
Step back.
Lillian, permit me to introduce
- The Great Volare.
- I' ve seen greater.
SignorVolare, I understand you' ve refused to dance with our company.
The truth of the matter is Mr. Volare won' t work with Mr. Flakfizer.
But, my dear Lillian, I am happy to announce that I have signed Mr. Volare to dance with and to be the artistic director of the Oglethorpe Ballet Company.
Ladies and gentlemen, the overture has started.
- Overture to what?
- The ballet find of the century.
- What?
- Roll up!
Roll up!
Top- class ballet, this way!
If you don' t like it, it was Rocco' s idea.
Oh, Roland, I love a surprise.
Yeah!
Mrs. Oglethorpe, meet the future world champion of ballet,
- Mr. Alan Grant.
- It' s a pleasure.
Nice to meet you.
Mrs. Oglethorpe, I would like to make an announcement.
- He' s being deported.
- I have found my prima ballerina...
-... the lovely Miss Lisa Le Baron.
Well...
But what about Alan?
Shall we say, a most unusual technique.
Perhaps better suited to experimental theater.
You can' t talk to my client like that.
If Alan isn' t in the company, I won' t be either.
- Neither will l.
- That' s a victory for all mankind.
You' re making a mistake, my dear.
Lisa, I agree with Volare.
But, Alan, we' il be apart for months.
Remember when you told me that with you dancing,
- it would be good for both of us?
- Yes, but --
When Volare makes you a star, you can choose anyone to dance with.
Dance with the Oglethorpe.
I' il be the proudest guy in the country.
- All right.
- You' ve made a wise choice, my dear.
I am so excited.
- You' re excited?
Feel these nipples.
Now, Lillian, about the directorship of the ballet company...
Yes, of course, Edmund.
You have brought us The Great Volare.
And dear Roland has presented us with our ballerina.
I think it only fair that you and Roland share the honor.
- Flakfizer?
This is preposterous.
- Preposterous, is it?
Why don' t we step outside
- and settle this like men.
- We are outside.
Then why don' t we step inside and settle this like women.
Or are you afraid, Lazlo?
- I' m twice the man you are.
- So is she.
And it' s driving me mad.
Oh, Lillian, can' t you see I' m on fire?
And you, you contemptible cur!
Maybe you don' t want to work for Mrs. Oglethorpe.
- Is that so, Edmund?
- Of course not!
I will do anything that is best for the ballet.
Well, there' s no need to commit suicide.
And to show you no hard feelings, how about a cigar.
- I don' t smoke.
- Well, I do.
Why don' t you run out and get me one.
Champagne!
I' m not going to work with such an uncouth pig.
- Certainly, Mr. Volare.
And a hefty per diem.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Here you go.
Here you go.
I' m all out of American currency.
Take a fistful of Romanian 50s, all right?
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.
The end of another grueling day.
The press conference is to begin in five minutes.
Roland seems to be running a little late.
Late?
That charlatan hasn' t been around in weeks.
He never responds to his calls.
He' s totally irresponsible.
Lisa.
Relax, my dear.
Everyone is nervous their first time.
Just follow my lead.
I' m very experienced.
- That' s very kind of you, Mr. Volare.
Call me Roberto.
Roberto.
Lisa, I know an intimate little bistro with a fabulous view of the city.
Perhaps dinner and an all- night boat ride?
Well, I don' t really think that would be such a good idea --
I hope I' m interrupting something.
Volare, you know it' s not polite to drool in public.
Roland, I haven' t seen you for weeks.
Lillian, my pile of sweetness.
I' m so sorry.
And how I missed you.
In fact, I missed you so much, two days ago I went out and I bought a woman who looks just like you.
- Oh, you silly.
- For you.
From you.
Another lovely bracelet.
I didn' t want this wrist to think I was neglecting it.
- Oh, Roland...
- Lillian, l --
Lazlo, I didn' t see you there.
I stand corrected.
I saw you, but I chose to ignore you.
Lisa, my darling.
Will you excuse us?
Two' s company and three' s an adult movie.
- Mrs. Oglethorpe, may we start?
- Oh, please.
Is she a fox or what?
Ladies and gentlemen, for many weeks now the Oglethorpe Ballet Company have been in rehearsal.
Tomorrow we open with Roberto Volare' s interpretation of Tears of the Swan.
At this time, I wish to introduce to you the creative genius behind our company, the brightest light in the ballet firmament...
Thank you for those kind words, Edmund Lazlo.
I don' t know who does your hair, but tell me, where do they do it and when are they bringing it back?
Well, I had a speech all prepared, but today I' m going to speak from the heart.
You' ve no doubt asked yourself, "Why has he been chosen for this task of running the Oglethorpe?"
Well, the whole story is right here in my autobiography:
Flakfizer:
A Man' s Man.
But I like women a lot more.
My intimate views of Jackie, Cher, Sean, Larry, Moe, Curly.
Over 200 pages of provocative pictures, and only one page has any writing on it.
Act now and you can get one of these fabulous "Flakfizer is ballet" T- shirts.
MasterCard and Visas accepted.
That brings me to the task at hand, to introduce the woman I adore.
Behind every great man is a woman.
I enjoy the shade.
Dear Lillian, soon I hope to take you on a Caribbean cruise, where we can hold hands on a soft summer' s evening and watch that old Jamaican moon.
Why that old Jamaican will be mooning us, I have no idea.
And now, here she is, the woman voted by her senior class
"most likely to go up a few dress sizes," a woman who would be a man, except her name is Lillian,
Lillian Oglethorpe.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, what' s with all the tears?
This should be the happiest night of your life.
It' s just that...... I miss Alan so much.
Well, I' d feel the same way if the man I loved was thousands of miles away.
Of course, I' d be living a whole different lifestyle.
Here, come with me.
I know just the thing to cheer you up.
If you just step right in here, my dear, your spirits might just brighten.
- But that' s Mr. Volare' s dressing room.
- Of course.
He' s got the best champagne.
- Alan!
- Lisa.
Flakfizer flew Alan out to see you in the opening of the ballet.
It' s a formal affair.
Do you have tuxedos?
I got mine.
That' s great for tomorrow, but aren' t you a little overdressed for today?
Oh, no.
- I' m very impressed.
- I don' t have any luggage.
I was worried there for a second.
Mr. Flakfizer, thank you.
I see you' re saving your best stuff for Alan.
I think we should leave the lovers alone for a few minutes.
Make that a few hours.
- I missed you so much.
- I don' t want us to be apart ever again.
- I told you before!
- Oh, my God, it' s Volare.
- You better hide.
- It throws off my bulge!
- Yes, Volare, I' m sorry.
Lisa, what a pleasant surprise.
I see you decided to start our little party early, huh?
- Roberto, you' ve got the wrong idea.
I think I' ve got the right idea.
- Get your hands off of her!
- You!
What are you doing here?
- Mr. Flakfizer flew me out.
You and Mr. Flakfizer are going to be sorry for this.
- Volare, what happened?
- It' s Flakfizer.
He' s brought that performance artist out here.
- Hasn' t that information arrived yet?
- No, but we may not need it.
I have devised a little plan.
He' s staying at Lillian' s townhouse.
All we have to do is make a few arrangements.
Oh, no.
Lillian?
- Well, no one' s in.
- Roland.
I didn' t think you were back so soon.
- Roland.
- Lillian...... can' t we just be friends?
Why, you' re not Lillian.
- You gonna spank me?
- We can start there...... and see what happens.
- Are we alone?
- Servants have the day off.
Lillian is already at the theater, but I' m here.
- Okay.
No standing eight count.
I wanna make love by candlelight.
I could do you one better.
I think this is more in keeping with... things to come.
Not a bad little pad Lillian' s got here.
- Was that the doorbell?
- That wasn' t you?
Just ignore it.
Maybe they can' t hear the bell.
Let' s try this.
I' il be right back.
If you need anything, there' s plenty of batteries in my room.
Oh, let me try this.
You go through the window.
If the alarm goes off, I' il run away so they won' t catch both of us.
We don' t want any!
Oh, it' s you.
We have to talk.
It' s very important.
The next half- hour, give or take 29 minutes, will be very important for me, so thanks for dropping by.
Yeah, but --
Flakfizer!
- The face is familiar.
- It' s mine.
And so it is.
We' il have lunch.
- Flakfizer.
- How come you didn' t knock?
I' m using a better grade of gas.
- That' s not bad, is it?
- You know, I always enjoy it when we get together, but I want you out, or I' il be forced to kill you.
I' il tell the police
- I did it out of love.
- Flakie, aren' t you coming to bed?
- That' s a girl.
- Not just a girl, a way of life.
What if Mrs. Oglethorpe comes back?
She' il have to wait her turn.
I saw Tina first.
Don' t you see?
Lazlo wants Mrs. Oglethorpe to catch you in bed with her!
Oh, no!
Mrs. Oglethorpe!
I' ve been in situations like this before.
We act calm.
Stay cool.
Okay, okay.
Tina leaves by the back door and no one is any the wiser.
- It' s an old Gary Hart trick.
- I' m not leaving till I' m satisfied.
You beast!
Really has a such a nice light touch with women.
How dare you...
Get her out of sight!
No, no, no!
That' s Lillian' s room.
- In here.
In here.
- Not there!
That' s my room.
I don' t know why you insist on returning to my home.
We can' t miss the final dress rehearsal of the ballet.
Lillian, my dear, we can' t go without Flakfizer.
I just thought it would make for a better appearance if we all arrive at the same time.
You have been looking at your watch all morning, Edmund.
Your behavior is most peculiar.
You big animal!
What was that?
We must investigate!
Edmund, what is this?
You relentless sex stallion.
Now she' s talking about me.
What was that?
Jacques, show her what will happen if she doesn' t shut up.
That came from your suite.
- Hide her!
- My bedroom?
Ninety- eight, 99, 100.
My two favorite L' s.
What on earth are you doing here at this ungodly hour?
I know you' re up to something, Flakfizer.
- A snap inspection?
- Roland.
- What are you doing in my bedroom?
- This is your room?
Thank God.
I thought someone sewed up all my fly- holes.
Lazlo, how about the three of us going down to the kitchen
- and making a big sandwich.
- I hardly think so.
I' m going to check under the bed.
Edmund!
What on earth has gotten into you?
- Be more careful.
- You did that on purpose.
You' re trying to conceal the fact that --
Your suite.
And I think you' re pretty terrific yourself.
You stay here.
There' s no telling what he may do in this crazed state!
Lazlo.
I say, Lazlo.
- What are you looking for?
- A woman.
- How about calling an escort service?
- I' m calling the police.
I' m so sorry.
I' m sorry.
The guest bedrooms.
- Roland.
- All right.
Get in.
Get in.
- Roland, what is all the commotion?
- It' s Lazlo.
I' ve never seen him like this.
Quick, in here.
And while you' re in there, why don' t you make the bed.
I know she' s here somewhere.
- Lazlo!
- What?
- What was that?
- I don' t know, but it came from in here.
- Edmund, this is outrageous.
- I can explain.
- He' s got a woman tied up.
- Edmund!
- She looks dazed and drugged.
- No.
He' s obviously the grand dragon of some sex- slave cult.
- And she looks like she' s about 1 5.
- No, no, no.
Okay, 1 4, then.
In fact, I know she' s 1 4 because I was dating her a year ago.
Edmund, I want you out of my house this instant.
If I had to take a wild guess, I' d say you' re out of a job.
I hope there' s no hard feelings.
You know, Lazlo, this is a good look for you.
Flakfizer.
Lazlo, are you decent?
- Lillian.
- Quick, smelling salts!
And a crane, if you got one.
You' ve done it now, Lazlo.
I don' t feel a thing.
This woman is dead.
- You' re holding his wrist.
- Then this man is dead.
- Mrs. Oglethorpe is unconscious.
- Smelling salts, right away.
Triple Speed Messenger Service.
I got a message here for a guy named Lazlo.
Give me that.
This is a litany of fraudulent accident cases, bad debts and several police departments who would love to get their hands on you.
And when Mrs. Oglethorpe comes to, she will read this and she will have no course but to fire you!
Quick, try some chloroform.
I' m taking Lillian to the hospital.
You, help me get her to the car.
Why don' t you take him along for a brain scan.
Easy.
- What are we gonna do now?
- What any Flakfizer would do.
What, something devious and underhanded?
You know the family.
If we don' t get that letter before Lillian wakes up, we' re dead ducks.
Multiple fractures?
Lucky day.
The name' s Flakfizer.
If any limb falls off, mail it to me.
It can only strengthen our case.
Roland T. Flakfizer.
This is your lucky day.
- This man' s dead.
- Then he won' t be needing this.
- I' m almost all out of business cards.
- Excuse me.
What are you gentlemen doing here?
We' re here to see Mrs. Lillian Oglethorpe.
I' m afraid that' s not possible.
She' s on a private floor.
Hospital personnel and doctors only.
Hi.
Ed Breckerman, security.
There' s a Mercedes on fire in the doctors' parking lot.
When will Mrs. Oglethorpe regain consciousness?
She' s under a sedative.
You' il have to ask the doctor.
- You called?
- At last.
No letter here.
Dark meat or white?
Now, this is a very important woman.
Hey, so do we.
I wanna assure you we' ve been doctors
- for many, many floors now.
- You' re not the doctor I saw earlier.
We' re filling in.
She' s been out since she came here?
- Yes.
- And so she hasn' t been able
- to read anything, then, huh?
- Of course not.
Good.
It will bring on complications.
Not for her, necessarily,
- but complications nonetheless.
- She' s coming to, doctor.
- Now we got complications.
- She' s going out, doctor.
- The crisis is over.
- This is ludicrous.
I don' t think anyone will argue that point.
It' s the first annual Vasectomy Bowl.
- What is going on?
- A happy doctor is a good doctor.
What is the meaning of this?
Are you sure you' re a doctor?
That' s gotta hurt.
At least, I hope it does.
- Doctor, we' il have to run a few tests.
- Table for one.
- There you go.
- Ground transportation, courtesy of Medicare.
You say ether and I say either Ether, either
I' m just checking on Mrs. Oglethorpe.
- Well, doctor?
- Yes, doctor?
- Yes, doctor?
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
- Yes.
Well, I thought we' il have to perform a full "rectumology."
An epidemic.
Drop those pants.
Not you, the patient.
- I thought you were cardiologists.
- They' re all connected.
We enter the rectum and head north.
Why do you think we have such long instruments?
- X- rays for Dr. Blazie.
I deal in x- rays.
- I see you do too.
- I used to work at Las Vegas General.
Security to Room 1 404.
Hit me.
- I' il play these.
Read them and weep.
Three hearts.
Beats a pair of kidneys.
- Doctor, your diagnosis?
- Difficult to tell from the negative.
- It' s her liver.
- Looks more like veal to me.
- What is this?
- An obstruction in the fourth lumbar.
Huge backup in the lower intestine.
Grab a left at the first major artery and get on the fifth lumbar heading south.
Skeletal update every hour on the hour.
- Time for a thorough checkup.
- It' s gotta be here somewhere.
- The operation is a success!
- Success.
- Success.
- Doctors, we' re done here.
Arrest those men.
Come here.
Come on, man.
What are you doing?
Come on.
Come here.
Stay still, all right?
- So you were the doctors.
- No, we' re not them.
We' re someone else.
The three you' re looking for are our twin brothers.
You' il never see us together, because we love the same women.
That' s next on Geraldo.
- Roland.
- Yes?
- What are you doing here?
- That' s a good question.
- What am I doing here?
- lmpersonating a doctor, harassing a patient, altering medical records.
And don' t forget Alan punching out Volare.
- Whose side are you on anyway?
- Give me that.
- Stealing private property.
- It could happen to anyone.
- Society' s to blame.
- Too much violence in the movies.
- It' s my environment.
- We were carrying out orders!
They' re buying up everything.
Did we leave anything out?
Could I have a personalized number?
Is my hair okay?
Empty your pockets.
You can make one call.
Hello, Sportsline?
Steamer, hi.
This is Rocco.
Am I on the air?
Give me that.
Be careful with that.
Do you know who this man is?
This is Jackson Pollock Jr., son of Roy Lichtenstein.
In a few years, this could be worth millions.
Hey.
- You got visitors.
- Maybe it' s somebody
- with a recording contract.
Lisa.
You can go home, fellas.
- You bribed a guard?
- I paid your bail.
- How did you do that?
- I used my severance pay.
- You have servants?
- No.
Volare fired me.
It seems I wasn' t appreciative enough.
- He can' t do that.
- No, he' s done it, all right.
And now he' s dancing with Lisa' s understudy.
The one with the large chest?
There' s nobody in the company like that.
- Would be if I were running things.
- This is terrible.
And Volare' s vowed to blackball us from ever dancing for a major ballet company.
- That' s not fair.
- I know.
- And it' s all my fault.
- Oh, it' s your fault, huh?
Alan, don' t talk that way.
Why, I wouldn' t dance with Volare if he were the last man on earth.
Wait a minute.
Just because you' re not in the ballet doesn' t mean you won' t dance tonight.
Flakfizer' s right.
I don' t know why, but he' s right.
And I think it' s about time for Alan to make his New York debut.
To the theater, and not a minute to lose!
- Break a leg, Mr. Volare.
- Grazie.
Tina, darling.
- Break a leg, Mr. Volare.
- Grazie.
- Break a leg, Mr. Volare.
- Grazie.
- Five minutes, Mr. Volare.
- Five minutes?
Oh, my God.
What have I been doing?
- Four minutes, Mr. Volare.
- Four minutes?
Three minutes, Mr. Jolson.
What' s going on here?
Where do you want these, Mr. Volare?
Just keep them out of my way.
Hurry up.
You too.
Where do you want these, Mr. Volare?
- What' s going on here?!
- How do I know?
Have you lost your mind?
Lobstergram for Mr. Volare.
Lobstergram!
Oh, there you are.
For he' s a jolly good fellow For he' s a jolly good fellow
For he' s a jolly good fellow
Lazlo!
Mr. Volare is coming.
Places, please.
T onight is your night, my dear.
Thanks to you, Edmund.
I will announce you as the sole director of our ballet company.
If I do say so myself, the ballet is in good hands.
How could I ever have trusted someone as nefarious as Roland Flakfizer?
I don' t wish to hear his name mentioned ever again.
Edmund.
It' s those idiots!
I will put a stop to this.
We' ve got a good one.
Another big- league ballet battle starring that plucky Roberto "Bulldog" Volare.
The sky is clear, the wind is blowing from left to right, which means the ballerinas should be flying out of here.
Volare does a pirouette, another pirouette.
He scores!
Listen to that crowd!
- It' s him!
- We return you now to your regularly scheduled program.
Come here.
Get the police now!
Hi.
Get out!
Get...
Hold it.
The Great Volare?
Bon voyage.
No!
- All right, yeah.
- Okay.
Here we go.
- Slam- dunk.
- Yes!
This is an outrage!
I will not continue unless you put a stop to this!
Yes, sir.
Find them!
- Let' s go.
Don' t -- Hey, give me that.
Get out of here.
Get out.
Get off.
Off.
Let' s go, this way.
- This way.
- Ole!
What on earth is happening?
Edmund.
Anyone?
- You rang?
- Roland, what is happening?
Ballet history.
When do we go on?
I' d say right about now.
There they are!
Arrest those men!
- Don' t let them get away!
- Oh, boy.
I will never work for the Oglethorpe Ballet again!
- Will you put that in writing?
- This evening could ruin my career!
At least we' re thinking along the same lines.
I must explain to my public this is all your doing.
- They' re trying to tell you something.
- I quit!
That' s what they' re trying to tell you.
Officers, take these people away.
Oh, my God, he' s got a gun!
The man' s insane.
He could use a gift certificate to the Betty Ford Center.
We' il have lunch right after the lobotomy.
Always remember, nobody likes you.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Wonderful.
Wonderful!
We' re a hit!
Get back out there.
- Listen to that crowd!
- You' re a ballet legend.
- And you' re not even dead yet.
- Oh, Roland, I' m so glad I trusted you.
Rest assured, my darling, I will never leave your side again.
What' s that?
Nothing.
Hey, what happened?
I got an idea.
Hey, big boy.
Come here.
Oh, boy.
Hello.
What?
No, I don' t work today.
I' m playing hockey at 2: 00.
Why don' t you call Randal?
'Cause I' m fuckin' tired!
I just closed last night.
Jesus.
What time do you think you' re gonna come in, 12: 00?
Where?
Swear you' il be there by 12: 00 and I' il do it.
12: 00, or I walk.
- <MUSlC> Ooh- hoo <MUSlC><MUSlC> - Thanks.
- Do you mind if I drink this here?
Go ahead.
- You open?
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?
- Am I sure about what?
- Are you sure?
- About what?
- Do you really wanna buy those cigarettes?
- Are you serious?
- How long you been smoking?
- What is this, a poll?
- How long you been a smoker?
I don' t know.
Since I was about 13.
Let' s see, you' re about 19, 20?
- Am I right?
- What in the hell is that?
That' s your lung.
By this time, your lung looks like this.
- You' ve gotta be shitting me.
- You think I' m shitting you?
- Here.
- What' s this?
A trach ring.
It' s what they install in your throat when cancer takes your voice box.
- Oh, God!
He smoked until the day he died.
- Excuse me, but --
This is where you' re heading.
Cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat.
- Do you really want that?
- lf it' s already too late, I guess --
No, it' s never too late.
Put the cigarettes back, and try some gum instead.
- Here.
Chewlies gum.
Try this. - it' s not the same.
It' s cheaper than cigarettes, and it certainly beats this.
- Oh, Jesus! - it' s a picture of a cancer- ridden lung.
Keep it.
- I' il just take the gum.
- Fifty- five.
You made a very wise choice.
Keep up the good work.
If you' re gonna drink that coffee, I think you oughta take it outside, huh?
I think I' il drink it in here.
If you' re gonna drink it in here, I' d appreciate it if you don' t bother the customers.
I' m sorry about that.
- Pack of cigarettes.
What' s that?
- This?
How long you been smoking?
Yeah!
I feel good today, Silent Bob.
We' re gonna make some money.
And you know what we' re gonna do?
We' re gonna go to that party and get some pussy.
I' m gonna fuck this bitch, I' m gonna fuck this bitch.
I' il fuck anything that moves!
What the fuck you lookin 'at?
I' il kick your fuckin 'ass!
Don' t that motherfucker owe me ten bucks?
You know, tonight we' re going to rip off this fucker' s head, take out his fuckin 'soul.
Remind me if he wants to buy something.
I' m gonna shit in the motherfucker' s bag.
- What' s up, baby?
What' s up, sluts?
So, Bob, you' re a rude motherfucker, you know that?
You' re cute as hell.
Line up three other guys, make like a circus seal.
Hey, what' re you, a fucking faggot?
I love women!
What you want, Grizzly Adams?
You' re spending what, 20, maybe 30 dollars a week on your cigarettes?
- Yeah.
- Forty.
Come on!
Would you give somebody that much money each week to kill you?
That' s what you' re doing now by paying for this so- called privilege to smoke!
We' re gonna croak sometime.
It' s that mentality that allows the cancer- producing industry to thrive.
Of course we' re all gonna die someday!
Do we have to pay for it?
Do we have to actually throw hard- earned dollars down on the counter... and say, "Please, Mr. Merchant of Death, sir, please,
"sell me something that will stink up my breath and clothes,
- and fry my lungs! "
Now, wait a second.
Here comes the speech about how he' s just doing his job by following orders.
Let me tell you about another group of hate- mongers that were just following orders.
- Who' s that?
- They were called Nazis!
- Yeah, that' s right.
- Friggin 'Nazi.
They practically wiped an entire nation off the Earth,
Like your cigarettes are doing now!
- You want me to leave.
'Cause somebody' s telling it like it is, giving these fine people a wake- up call?
- Yeah.
- No, you' re loitering and causing a disturbance.
I' m a disturbance?
You' re the disturbance, pal.
I' m gonna buy some Chewlies gum.
I' m a customer engaged in a discussion with the other customers.
- That' s right.
- Smoke my big fat cock!
He' s scared now 'cause he sees the threat we present.
He smells the change is coming!
You definitely are the source in this area, and we' re gonna shut you down for good!
For good, cancer merchant!
[Chanting]
Cancer merchant!
Who' s leading this mob?
That guy.
Freeze!
Let' s see some credentials.
Slowly!
Chewlies?
You' re stirring up anti- smoking sentiment to, what, sell more gum?
Get out of here!
And you people -- Don' t you have jobs to go to?
Go commute.
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
A bunch of easily led automatons.
Try thinking for yourselves before you pelt an innocent man with cigarettes!
Uh, pack of cigarettes?
Don' t you think you' re taking this a bit too hard?
I have enough indignities in my life and people start throwing cigarettes at me.
- At least they weren' t lit.
- Oh, I hate this fucking place.
Then quit.
You should be going to school anyway.
Please, Veronica, at this point, the last thing I need is a lecture.
All I' m saying is, if you' re that unhappy, you should leave.
- I' m not even supposed to be here today!
- I know.
Your mom told me you left, like, at 6: 00 or something.
He couldn' t come in.
- Don' t you have a hockey game at 2: 00?
And I' m gonna play like shit because I didn' t have a good night' s sleep.
- Why' d you agree to come in then?
- Hey, I' m only here until 12: 00.
The boss comes in.
- Why don' t you open the shutters?
- Someone jammed gum in the locks.
- You' re kidding.
- Bunch of savages in this town.
- How much money did you leave up there?
Like, three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles.
This time in the morning, people just get a paper or coffee.
- You' re trusting.
- Why do you say that?
How do you know they' re taking the right amount of change or even paying for what they take?
Theoretically, people see money on the counter, no one around, they think they' re being watched.
Honesty through paranoia.
Why do you smell like shoe polish?
I needed shoe polish to make that sign out there.
- [Door Opens]
You think anybody can see us down here?
Why, you wanna have sex or something?
- Can we?
- Really?
- I was kidding.
- Like you can' t get enough of me.
- Typically male point of view.
- How do you figure?
Show some bedroom proficiency, you think you' re gods.
What about what we do for you?
Women as lovers are basically the same; they just have to be there.
- Be there?
- Making a male climax isn' t at all challenging.
Insert somewhere close, preferably moist, thrust, repeat.
How flattering.
Now, making a woman come, therein lies a challenge.
You think so?
A woman makes a guy come, it' s standard.
A guy makes a woman come, it' s talent.
- And I actually date you?
- Something wrong?
I' m insulted.
Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off.
Just being there, as you put it, is not enough.
Hmm, I' ve touched a nerve.
I' m astonished to hear you you trivialize my role in our sex life.
It wasn' t directed at you.
I was making a broad generalization.
You' re making a generalization about broads.
Those are my opinions based on the few women... who were goodly enough to sleep with me.
- How many?
- How many what?
How many different girls have you slept with?
- We might have.
- I don' t remember.
How many? - including you?
It better be up to and including me.
- Twelve.
- You slept with 12 different girls?
Including you?
Yes.
What' d you do that for?
- You' re a pig!
- Why' d you hit me?
- Do you know how many different men I' ve had sex with?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
- Three.
- Three?
- Three, including you.
- You only slept with three different people?
- I' m not the pig you are.
- Who?
- No, who are the three, besides me.
- John Francin and Rob Stanslik.
You men make me feel sick.
- You' il sleep with anything that says yes.
- Animal, mineral or vegetable.
Vegetable, meaning paraplegic.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me big.
Name it.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
- Where?
- To school.
There' s a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program... after a lapse in enrollment.
Can' t we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
It' s important to me, Dante.
You have so much potential that' s going to waste in this pit.
- Stop.
You' re making my head hurt.
Why' re you getting up?
- Unlike you, I have class in 45 minutes.
Willam?
Hey, Ronni.
How you been, man?
What, do you work here now?
No, I was visiting my man.
Dante, this is Willam Black.
This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.
- How you doing?
- No, and a pack of cigarettes.
So where you been, man?
Still going to Seton Hall?
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year.
I was tired of missing him.
That' s beautiful, man.
So, you still talk to Silvan?
I just talked to her on Monday.
We still hang out on weekends.
Oh, that' s great.
Well, you two lovebirds take it easy, okay?
Take it easy.
That was Snowball.
- Why do you call him that?
Silvan made it up.
It' s a blow job thing.
What do you mean?
After the blow job, he likes to have it spit back into his mouth while kissing.
It' s called snowballing.
- He gets off on it.
- Silvan can be talked into anything.
- Why do you say that?
Like you said, she snowballed him.
- Silvan?
- Yeah, right.
I' m serious.
- You sucked that guy' s dick?
How do you think I knew --
You said you only had sex with three different guys!
You never mentioned him!
- Because I never had sex with him.
- You sucked his dick!
We went out a few times.
We never had sex, but we fooled around.
Why did you tell me you only had sex with three guys?
Because I did only have sex with three guys. - it doesn' t mean I didn' t just go with people.
I thought you understood.
I did understand!
I understood that you had sex with three guys and that' s all you said!
- Please calm down.
- How many dicks have you sucked?
Shut up a second and I' il tell you.
I didn' t freak out like this when you told me how many girls you fucked!
This is different.
This is important.
- Something like 36.
Something like 36?
- Lower your voice.
- What is that -- "Something like 36"?
Does that include me?
- Uh... 37.
- I' m 37?
- I' m going to class.
- Oh, my God.
- 37!
My girlfriend sucked 37 dicks! - in a row?
- Where you going?
Until today, you never even knew... how many guys I slept with because you never even bothered to ask.
I never had sex with 12 guys!
- No, but you sucked enough dick!
- Yeah, I went down on a few guys.
- One of those guys was you.
The last one, I might add.
Which, if you' re too stupid to comprehend, means that I' ve been faithful to you since we met.
If you want to have a complex, go ahead.
But don' t look at me like I' m the town whore, because you were plenty busy before you met me.
Why did you suck their dick?
Why couldn' t you sleep with them Like any other decent person?
Because going down isn' t a big deal.
I used to like a guy, we' d make out, and sooner or later I' d go down on him.
- I feel sick.
Don' t feel sick.
Every time I kiss you, I' m gonna taste 36 other guys.
- I' m going to school.
Maybe later you' il be a bit more rational.
Good- bye, Dante!
Hey, try not to suck any dick on the way through the parking lot!
Hey, you!
I thought that place was supposed to be open at 11: 00. it' s 11: 20.
I' ve already called his house twice.
He' il be here soon.
Hey, it' s not like it' s a demanding job over there.
I' d like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV.
I walked in the other day, that son of a bitch was sleeping.
- I' m sure he wasn' t sleeping.
- Are you calling me a liar?
He was probably just resting his eyes.
What the hell is that, "resting his eyes"?
- Like he' s some air traffic controller?
- Actually, that' s his night job.
Wise ass too, huh?
Keep cracking wise.
That' s why you' re jockeying a register in some fuckin 'convenience store... instead of working at a steady job.
I' ve got no time to bullshit around, waiting for that son of a bitch.
Make sure he gets that.
The number' s 812.
I wanted a movie tonight.
If you tell me the title of the movie, he' il hold it for you.
Don' t hurt yourself, buddy.
I' il go to Big Choice Video instead.
You forgot your keys.
- Guy ain' t here yet.
- You' re kidding! it' s almost 11: 30.
- I' ve been here since 11: 00.
- I hate it when I can' t rent videos!
I would' ve went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on that wall.
- Dental School.
You came for that too?
That' s the movie I came for.
- I have first dibs.
Says me.
I' d call that first dibs.
- Ain' t gonna happen, my friend.
I' m getting that movie.
I' il bet you 20 bucks you don' t get to rent that tape.
- Twenty bucks?
- Twenty bucks.
You' re on.
You' re late.
- What the hell are you doing here?
Arthur fell ill.
- Why are the shutters closed?
- Someone jammed gum in the locks.
- Bunch of savages in this town.
- That' s what I said.
If I' d known you were here, I' d have come even later.
- What smells like shoe polish?
- Hey, you see a set of keys around here?
- No time for love, Dr. Jones.
Fucking kids.
Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees.
I tore up his membership.
Shocking abuse of authority.
I' m a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.
- [Randal]
Want something to drink?
- [Dante]
Who was on your phone this morning, like, 2: 30?
- I was trying to call for half an hour.
I wanted to use your car.
You don' t wanna know.
- You call Caitlin again?
- You tell Veronica?
- One fight a day with Veronica is all I can stomach, thanks.
- What do you fight about?
- We don' t fight about anything.
She wants me to leave here and go back to school and get some direction.
- I bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
- You win.
Let the past be the past.
You been with Veronica how long now?
- Seven months.
- Chick' s nuts about you.
- How long you date Caitlin?
- Five years.
Chick only made you nuts, man.
She cheated on you how many times?
- Eight and a half.
- Eight and a half?
Party at John Kay' s, senior year; I get blitzed, pass out in his bedroom.
- Caitlin comes in and jumps all over me.
- So that' s cheating?
In the middle of it she called me Brad.
- She called you Brad?
People say crazy shit during sex.
- One time, I called this girl "mom."
- I hit the light, she freaks.
- She thought I was Brad Michelson.
- What do you mean?
She was supposed to meet Brad in a dark bedroom.
- She didn' t even know I was at the party.
- Oh, my God.
- That girl was vile to you.
Do you know who wound up in that bedroom with Brad?
- Your mother?
- Alan Harris.
- Chess team Alan Harris?
- The two moved to Idaho together.
They raise sheep.
- That' s frightening.
- Takes different strokes to move the world.
In light of this lurid tale, I don' t see... how you could romanticize your relationship with Caitlin.
She broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
There was a lot of good in our relationship.
Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.
That' s what high school was about: algebra, bad lunch and infidelity.
- You think things will be different this time?
When she calls me now, she' s a different person.
She' s frightened, vulnerable.
She' s finishing college and about to enter the real world.
- Shit, I gotta place an order.
- Talkin 'to myself here.
- I' m listening.
She' s leaving college and -- - And she' s looking for support.
- I think this is leading our relationship to a new level.
- What about Veronica?
I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation... of a subconscious desire to break up with her, so I can pursue a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
- Caitlin' s on the same wavelength? - it' s safe to say yes.
- I think all four of you better sit down and talk it over.
You, Veronica, Caitlin and Caitlin' s fiancé.
- Do you sell video tapes?
- Yeah.
What are you looking for?
- Happy Scrappy Hero Pup.
- Uh, one second.
I' m on the phone with the distribution house.
Let me make sure they got it.
- What' s it called again?
- Happy Scrappy Hero Pup.
- [Child]
Happy Scrappy -- - She loves it.
This is RST Video calling.
Customer number 4352.
I' d like to place an order.
I need one each of the following tapes:
Whispers in The Wind, To Each His Own,
Put it Where it Doesn' t Belong, My Pipes Need Cleaning,
All Tit Fucking, Volume Eight, I Need Your Cock,
Ass Worshipping Rim Jobbers, My Cunt And Eight Shafts,
Cum Clean, Cum Gargling Naked Sluts, Cum Buns ill,
Cumming in Socks, Cum On ilene,
Huge Black Cocks With Pearly White Cum,
Girls Who Crave Cock, Girls Who Crave Cunt,
Men Alone Il:
The KY Connection, Pink Pussy Lips, oh, yeah, and, uh, All Holes Filled with Hard Cock.
Oh, wait a minute.
What was that called again?
Yes, I' d like to check on a misprint in today' s edition.
Today' s edition.
It says, "Bree to wed Asian design major."
No, everything' s spelled fine.
I was just wondering if the article was a misprint.
I don' t know, Like a typographical error or something.
Maybe it should say, "Caitlin Bray" or "Caitlin Bre" with one "E."
A curious party.
I talk to her all the time and she never mentioned this engagement.
That' s why I' m thinking maybe it' s a misprint.
Maybe there' s a vindictive printer working for you.
Meaning like, someone who asked her out once and got shot down, and this is his revenge by putting this bogus article in the paper when it went to press.
Hello?
I don' t care if she' s my cousin, I' m gonna knock those boots again tonight.
The fuckin 'human vacuum.
- Scumbag, what are you doing?
- Just hanging with Silent Bob and his cousin.
- He' s from Russia too.
- No way.
- What part of Russia?
Do I look Like his fuckin 'biographer?
- Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
- He only speaks Russian?
- He speaks some English, but he cannot speak it good like we do.
- Nah, he' s moving to the big city this week.
- He wants to be a metal singer.
I swear.
Olaf, metal.
That' s his fucking metal face.
- That' s fucked up, man.
- What did he say?
- I don' t know, man, but this guy' s a character.
- He really wants to play metal?
- Yeah, he' s got his own band in Moscow. - it' s called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something.
- That doesn' t sound metal.
You gotta hear him sing.
Olaf, "Berserker."
- Come on, man, "Berserker"!
- Does he sing in English or Russian?
Come on, "Berserker."
Girls think sexy.
- Watch, he' s gonna sing it.
<MUSlC> Would you like some making fuck, berserker <MUSlC>
- That' s fuckin 'funny, man.
<MUSlC> My love for you is ticking clock, berserker <MUSlC>
<MUSlC> Would you like to suck my cock, berserker <MUSlC><MUSlC>
That' s beautiful, man.
Hold on to the counter and I' il pull.
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
Maybe we oughta soap your hand up.
They oughta put a warning on these things, like they do with cigarettes.
- I think it' s coming!
I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital.
I' il throw this out as a precautionary measure.
Stings a little.
A little word of advice:
Sometimes you got to let those hard- to- reach chips go.
- [Door Opens]
You know, that article' s accurate.
Caitlin really is getting married.
- You know what I just watched?
- Me pulling a can off some moron' s fist?
- Didn' t you hear me?
Caitlin is really getting married.
What did you like better:
Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back?
- Empire.
- Blasphemy.
Empire had the better ending.
I mean, Luke gets his hand cut off, finds out Vader' s his father.
Han gets frozen, taken away by Boba Fett. it ends on such a down note.
I mean, that' s what life is: a series of down endings.
All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
There was something else going on in Jedi.
- They build another Death Star, right?
The first one was completed and fully operational before the rebels destroyed it.
Give credit where credit' s due.
- Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
Something just never sat right with me that second time around.
I could never put my finger on it, but something just wasn' t right.
- And you figured it out.
- The first Death Star was manned by the lmperial Army.
The only people on board were Storm Troopers, dignitaries, lmperialists.
- Basically.
- So when they blew it up, no problem.
Evil' s punished.
- And the second time around? - it wasn' t even done being built yet. - it was still under construction.
A construction job of that magnitude would require... a lot more manpower than the lmperial Army had to offer.
I' il bet they brought independent contractors in on that thing.
- Plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers -- - Not just lmperialists.
- Is that what you' re getting at?
To get it built quickly and quietly, they' d hire anybody that could do the job.
You think the average Storm Trooper knows how to install a toilet main?
- All they know is killing.
- So they bring in independent contractors.
- Why are you so upset?
- Those innocent contractors brought in are killed, casualties of a war they had nothing to do with.
Look, you' re a roofer.
Some juicy government contract comes your way.
You got a wife and kids, the two- story in suburbia.
This is a government contract which means all sorts of benefits.
Along come these left- wing militants who blast everything... within a three- mile radius with their lasers.
You didn' t ask for that; you had no personal politics.
- You' re just trying to scrape out a living.
- I don' t mean to interrupt,
- The ending of Return Of The Jedi.
My friend is trying to convince me that independent contractors working on the Death Star... were innocent victims when it was destroyed by the rebels.
I' m a contractor myself.
"Done And Ready Home improvements."
- comes into play heavily when choosing jobs.
Three weeks ago, I was offered a job up in the hills.
A simple re- shingling job.
They told me if I could finish it in one day, I would double my price.
- Then I realized whose house it was.
- [Dante]
- Dominic Bambino' s.
- Baby Face Bambino?
The same!
The money was right, but the risk was too high.
I knew who he was, and based on that, I turned the job over to a friend.
- Based on personal politics.
The next week, the Foresie family put a hit on Baby Face' s house.
Didn' t even finish re- shingling.
- No way.
I' m alive because I knew the risk involved in that particular client.
My friend wasn' t so lucky.
Any contractor working on that Death Star knew the risk involved.
If they got killed, it' s their own fault.
A roofer listens to this, not his wallet.
They say so much, but they never tell you if it' s any good.
Are either one of these any good?
- Sir?
- Are either one of these any good?
- I don' t watch movies.
Well, have you heard anything about either one of them?
I find it' s best to stay out of other people' s affairs.
You mean you haven' t heard anybody say anything about either one of these?
Nope.
- Well, what about these two?
These are the same two movies.
- You weren' t paying any attention.
- No, I wasn' t.
I don' t think your manager would appreciate it --
- I don' t appreciate your ruse, ma' am.
- I beg your pardon?
Your cunning attempt to trick me.
I was only pointing out that you weren' t paying any attention to what I was saying.
And I hope it feels good.
- You hope what feels good?
- I hope it feels so good to be right.
There' s nothing more exhilarating... than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
Well, this is the last time I rent here!
- You will be missed.
- Hey, you' re not allowed to rent here anymore!
Screw me?
- You' il never believe what this unruly customer just said.
- Wait.
- This guy' s going through all the eggs.
This has been going on for 20 minutes now.
- What' s he looking for?
- Said he has to find the perfect dozen.
- Perfect dozen?
- Each egg has to be perfect.
- The quest isn' t going well?
- Obviously not.
- Look at all the cartons that didn' t make the grade.
- I told him that, and he yelled at me.
- What' d he say?
He says no one has any pride anymore.
It' s not like you laid the eggs yourself.
After that, I' m calling the cops.
I' m not even supposed to be here today.
Two packs of cigarettes.
- I' m as puzzled as you.
- I' ve actually seen it before.
- No, but I know the behavior.
- Let me guess.
- [Randal]
- I' il bet you a million dollars he' s a guidance counselor.
- [Dante]
I saw it happen in Food City, Like, last year.
Stock boy said he' d been looking through cartons of eggs for half an hour, doing all sorts of endurance tests and stuff.
I asked him why nobody ever called the manager, and he said it happens... two, three times a week, sometimes more.
- Get out of here.
- No, I kid you not.
They call it shell shock.
Seems to only happen with guidance counselors.
They used to make a big deal of it, but they just let it go now... because they always pay for whatever they break, and they never bother anybody.
Why guidance counselors?
If your job was as meaningless as theirs, wouldn' t you go crazy too?
- Come to think of it, my guidance counselor was kinda worthless.
It' s important to have a job that makes a difference, boys.
That' s why I manually masturbate caged animals for artificial insemination.
Did you ever notice that all the prices end in "9"?
Damn, that' s eerie.
- Do you know how much the average jiz- mopper makes per hour?
The guy that cleans up the nudie booths after each guy jerks off.
- "Nudie booth"?
- You ever been in a nudie booth?
- Guess not.
Oh, man, it' s great.
You go into this booth, and there' s this glass between you and these chicks.
- And they put on a show for you for, like, ten bucks.
- What kind of a show?
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you' d like to see chicks do.
They insert things into any opening on their body.
- Any opening.
- Can we not talk about this now?
The jiz- mopper' s job is to clean it up after each guy shoots a load.
Practically everybody does it right on the window.
I don' t know if you know this, but cum leaves streaks if you don' t clean it right away.
- I will never come to this place again.
Using filthy language in front of the customers.
Oh, l- I' m sorry.
I guess we kinda got carried away.
I don' t know if sorry can make up for it.
You' ve highly offended me.
Well, if you think that' s offensive, check this out.
- I think you can see her kidneys.
- Why do you do things like that?
- You know he' s only going to come back and tell the boss.
Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight.
This job would be great if it wasn' t for the fucking customers.
I' m gonna hear from the boss tomorrow.
- Would you loosen up?
You' d feel a lot better if you' d just rip into the occasional customer.
Why? l- I don' t bother them and they don' t bother me.
Tell me there aren' t customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
- There aren' t!
- How can you lie like that?
Why don' t you vent?
Who pisses you off?
Well, I guess it isn' t customers in particular.
Maybe just a group of customers.
- Well, let' s hear it.
- Well, the Milk Maids.
The Milk Maids?
The women that go through every gallon of milk, looking for that later date, as if somewhere beyond all the other gallons is a container of milk... that won' t go bad for like a decade.
You know who I can do without?
The people in the video store.
- Which ones?
What would you get for a six- year- old boy who chronically wets his bed?
So, do you have any new movies in?
Do you have that one with that guy who was in that movie that was out last year?
They never rent quality flicks.
They always pick the most intellectually devoid movie on the racks.
It' s like in order to join they have to have an I. Q. less than their shoe size.
You should hear the barrage that I get.
What do you mean there' s no ice?
So, how much is this thing anyway?
Do you sell hubcaps for a '72 Pinto hatchback?
Mini- Trucker magazine.
You vented.
Don' t you feel better?
- Because my ex- girlfriend is getting married.
It' s always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin.
Veronica!
- What happened to home by 12: 00?
- Boss hasn' t shown up yet.
- Lit.
- So I stopped home and I brought you some lunch.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off.
- Really?
Oh, you' re the queen.
I' m glad you calmed down a bit.
Hi, Randal.
- Thirty- seven?
- Shut up!
I' m not happy, but I' il be able to deal.
- Why don' t you go back to the video store?
- I had to tell someone.
He put it into perspective.
- He said at least he wasn' t 36.
And that made you feel better?
And he said most of them were college guys I never even seen or met before.
If you don' t see it -- - it isn' t there.
- Thank you for being rational.
- Thank you for the lasagna.
- Couldn' t get the shutters open?
He said the earliest he could be here is tomorrow morning.
Well, I gotta head back for the 1: 30 class.
- What time you get finished?
- 8: 00, but I have a sorority meeting 'til 9: 00.
So, I' il see you when you close then.
- Sure.
- Good.
See you when you close.
Vermont?
I just talked to him this morning.
He left at what time?
When the hell was someone going to tell me?
He promised me he' d be here by noon!
Jesus, when does he get back?
Tuesday?
You' ve gotta be fucking kidding me!
I' ve got a hockey game at 2: 00, and the steel shutters are jammed closed.
I' m not even supposed to be here today!
So I' m stuck here until closing?
I can' t fucking believe this.
No.
I didn' t mean to yell at you.
Yeah, I know.
No, l- I' il be all right.
Well, that' s all I can do, right?
Bye.
- Can you fucking believe this?
- He didn' t mention that to you this morning?
Not a fucking word, that slippery shit.
- So, what?
You' re stuck here all day?
- Why' d you apologize?
- What?
I heard you apologize.
You had every reason in the world to be mad.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life.
- Ever backing down.
You always back down.
You assume blame that' s not yours.
You come in on your day off; you buckle like a belt.
- You know what really pisses me off?
- That I' m right about your buckling?
- I' m going to miss the fucking game!
- Shut up with that shit.
It ain' t helping!
- Don' t yell at me, pal.
- See?
- I can' t believe I' m going to miss the fucking game.
- At least we' re stuck here together.
You got a customer.
What do you want?
I can' t fucking believe this.
Yeah, hello, Sanford.
Dante.
I' m stuck at work.
Yeah, I know I' m not scheduled today -- Forget it.
Point is, I can' t play today.
Neither can Randal.
Wait a second.
Do we have to play at the park?
You feeling limber?
- Pull my laces tighter, man.
I never thought you capable of such a blatant disregard of store policy.
- I told him I had a game today.
It' s his own fault.
- I just want to play hockey Like I was scheduled to.
- I' m gonna grab a Gatorade.
- lf you grab a Gatorade, then everybody' s gonna grab one.
- Who' s gonna pay for these Gatorades?
- What do you care, you shoe polish- smelling motherfucker?
- I can' t have everybody grabbing free drinks.
- What responsibility?
- You' re closing the store to play hockey.
- He' s blunt, but he' s got a point.
Will you let me maintain some semblance of managerial control?
No, I' m sayin 'if you' re gonna be insubordinate, might as well go the full nine, not pussy out when it comes to free shit to drink.
As if we' re going to have a run on Gatorade.
All right!
- I hear Caitlin' s marrying an Asian drum major.
- Can we not talk about this?
- Fine by me.
But you' re living in denial and suppressing rage, motherfucker.
- I don' t know.
Look who you' re asking here.
- Then where are we gonna play?
I got it.
- When is this period over?
- Eight more minutes.
What, are you shitting me?
I wanna get cigarettes.
- I' m gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder.
Now, lose the skates, Dorothy Hamill, and open the fucking store!
- Dante, where are you?
- He' s busy! - in a second!
Oh, look at you.
You can' t even pass.
- How about covering the point?
- Who are you to make assessments?
- I' il assess all I want, pal!
- Dante, you in or out?
- Don' t pass to this guy.
You suck!
- Like you' re any better?
- Easy to say over there.
- Give me a stick, pretty boy!
I' il knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass!
- You open?
- Yeah, you open?
No!
All right, there' s a stick over there.
Come on.
- Give me another ball.
- There are no more.
What the fuck you talking about?
I brought the orange one and... the orange one.
Hey, any balls down there?
About the biggest pair you ever seen, dingleberry.
- You only brought one ball?
- I thought Redding brought all the balls.
Dante had the balls.
Shit!
We got what, 12 minutes of a game and it' s over?
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
I' m not even supposed to be here today.
I still get free Gatorade, right?
- Be careful.
You know, the insides of those has got stuff that can give you cancer.
- So I' m told.
I had a friend that chewed glass for a living. in the circus.
- And he got cancer from chewing fluorescent bulb glass?
- Got hit by a bus.
- Oh.
Well, uh, that depends.
You got maybe a toilet in here?
- Yeah, but it' s for employees only.
But I, uh, thought maybe you' d let me use it anyway.
I' m not so young anymore and I' m, how do you say, a little incontinent.
- Sure. in the back, through the cooler.
Say, uh, what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
- I didn' t ask about the color.
I mean, is it rough or is it cottony?
- Actually, it' s kinda rough.
It' s gonna knock the hell out of my hemorrhoids.
I thought maybe you could Let me have a roll of the soft stuff.
I see you sell the soft stuff back there.
- Yeah, but -- - Come on, boitshik!
You said yourself you have the rough stuff in the back.
- Yeah, sure.
Go ahead.
You' re a lifesaver.
Say, young fella, I hate to bother you again, but, uh, maybe I could have something in the back there to read?
A paper or something?
Sometimes it takes me a while, and I like to have something to read while it' s going on.
[Dante]
One of the magazines you got in the back behind the counter.
- The porno mags?
I like the cartoons.
They draw some of the biggest titties you ever saw.
Not this one.
Maybe the one you got underneath this one.
- They got bigger titties in there.
- Now leave me alone.
- Oh, thank you, sonny boy.
I appreciate it.
Hell of a game.
One ball?
I close the store, they come all the way here, for one ball?
Hockey is hockey.
At least we got to play.
Twelve minutes is not a game.
- Bitch, bitch, bitch.
You want something to drink?
- Hey, what happened to all the Gatorade?
- Exactly.
- Know what Sanford told me?
- I can' t believe Caitlin' s getting married.
- Julie Doyer died.
- Yeah, right.
- No, I' m serious.
Sanford' s brother dates her cousin.
He found out this morning.
- Embolism in her brain.
- She was swimming in the pool in the YMCA when it happened.
- She died mid- backstroke.
- I haven' t seen her in, like, two years.
Correct me if I' m wrong, but wasn' t she one of the illustrious 12?
- You' ve had sex with a dead person.
- I' m gonna go to her wake.
- No, you' re not. it' s today.
- Posten' s Funeral Parlor.
- Shit!
What about tomorrow?
- One night only.
She' s buried in the morning.
- You gotta watch the store.
I gotta go to this.
- Has it occurred to you that I might be bereaved as well?
- You hardly knew her.
But do you know how many people are gonna be there?
- All her old classmates, to say the least.
I' m not gonna miss what' s probably gonna be the social event of the season.
- You hate people!
- But I love gatherings. isn' t it ironic?
Stop being an asshole.
Someone' s gotta watch the store.
- lf you go, I go.
She meant nothing to you neither 'til I told you she died.
- I' m not taking you to this funeral.
- I can' t close the store.
- You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof.
Which means I can' t close it for another hour just so we can both go to a wake.
You were saying?
Thanks for putting me in such a tough spot.
- She was pretty young, huh?
- Embolism in a pool.
- What an embarrassing way to die.
- That' s nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
- How did he die?
- He broke his neck.
He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.
- Shut the hell up.
- I swear.
- Stop it.
- Bible truth.
Haven' t you ever tried to suck your own dick?
- No.
- Yeah, right.
You' re so repressed.
- Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
As if a guy' s a fucking pervert 'cause he tries to go down on himself.
You' re as curious as the rest of us, pal.
You' ve tried it.
- Who found him?
- My cousin?
He was on his bed, his legs doubled over himself.
Mom freaked out.
- Made it, huh?
Dick in his mouth?
Balls resting on his lips.
- Wow.
- Yeah, but at what a price.
- I can never reach.
- Reach what?
- You know.
- What, your dick?
Like you said, I guess everybody gets curious and tries it sometime.
I never tried it.
Fucking pervert.
- I knew this was a bad idea to close the store.
At least on the roof, I could see if anybody wanted to go in.
Nobody' s there.
How many people ever come to the store at 4: 00 on a Saturday?
Let me in!
- [Door Closes]
I' m telling you, it wasn' t my fault.
- You knocked the casket over, for Christ' s sake!
- I was just leanin 'on it. - it was an accident.
- Like someone knocks a casket over on purpose!
Big deal.
- Her fucking body fell out!
I put her back in it. it' s not like it matters if she breaks something.
- [Jay]
Shut the fuck up, junkie.
- Would you just go open the video store?
How many times have I told you not to be dealing in front of the store?
I' m not dealing.
What' re you talking about?
- Have you got anything, man?
- Let me borrow your car.
- I don' t want to talk to you.
Just let me borrow your car.
- I want to rent a movie.
- You want to rent a movie.
- [Sighs]
- You work in a video store!
- I work in a shitty video store.
I want to go to a good video store so I can get a good movie.
And a pack of cigarettes.
- Cute cat.
What' s its name?
Fucking dickhead.
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers sometimes?
- Let me borrow your car.
- May I be blunt with you?
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST Video, respectively.
As such, we have certain obligations that, although they may seem cruel and unusual,
- does mean manning the store until closing.
So playing hockey and attending wakes are standard operating procedures?
Those are obligations that couldn' t have been met at any other date.
Now, renting videos, that' s gratuitous, not to mention illogical, being that you work at a video store.
- Are you open?
- Yes.
- I don' t care for your rationale. - it' s gonna have to do, being it' s my car up for request.
- Can I help you?
- A pack of cigarettes.
- My point is, you' re a clerk, paid to do a job.
You can' t just do anything you want while you' re working.
"Space alien revealed as head of Time- Warner.
Report stock increase. "
They print any kind of shit in this paper.
- Your argument is that title dictates behavior.
The reason you won' t Let me use your car is because I have a title and job description,
- and I' m supposed to follow it, right?
I saw one one time that said,
"The next week, the world is ending."
In the next week' s paper, they said,
"We were miraculously saved at the zero hour... by a koala- fish mutant bird."
So I' m no more responsible for my decisions here than, say, a death squad soldier in Bosnia?
You' re not being asked to slay children or anything.
- Yeah, not yet.
I' m gonna break your fucking head, you fucking jerk!
- I' m sorry.
He meant to hit me.
Well, he missed.
Here, let me refund your money and we' il call if even, all right?
And if I see you again, I' m gonna break your fucking head open!
- What the fuck did you do that for?
One, I hate it when people can' t shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
- And two, to prove a point.
Title does not dictate behavior.
- lf title dictated my behavior as a clerk serving the public,
I wouldn' t be allowed to spit water at that guy, but I did.
My point is that people dictate their own behavior.
Even though I work in a video store, I choose to rent movies at Big Choice.
- You are a danger to both the dead and the living.
I like to think I' m a master of my own destiny.
- Please get the hell outta here.
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
- Excuse me?
- I heard you strain when you picked up that milk. - it only weighs seven pounds.
- I didn' t strain.
I don' t think so.
A deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles.
I' m a trainer.
I know what that sound signifies.
There' s no fat on my body.
No tone either.
You don' t get enough exercise.
- You open?
- Just the paper.
- Thirty- five.
Hey, uh, let me ask you a question.
I don' t know.
- I am -- I am not!
- He is.
How much can you bench?
- I don' t know.
- I' d say about 60, 70, tops.
- Three- fifty, four.
- No way!
Hey, that' s tight.
Solid.
Now feel this.
- Oh, for God' s sakes!
- See, you' re ashamed.
Here.
Take my card.
I can get you on an aerobics/ free weights program.
- Are you open?
Yes.
Excuse me.
- Yeah, since 6: 00 this morning.
- He' s got those love handles.
I don' t have love handles!
- Were you working here about 4: 00?
- Yes. - it' s probably from being around all this food every day.
If I had to work here all day, I' d be bloated and out of shape too.
- I' m not out of shape.
- Can I have your name, please?
Why?
What' s this all about?
Oh, my God.
I didn' t even recognize you.
- Because he' s out of shape!
Do you remember Alyssa Jones?
- With Caitlin Bree!
- I' m her sister.
You' re Alyssa' s sister Heather?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
A little taller than her?
Gorgeous body?
- And you' re Dante Hicks.
You went to the same school.
You played hockey.
How did you know that?
- You still goin 'out with her?
- No, she' s getting married.
No.
Don' t take this the wrong way, but, uh, I used to fuck her.
- What?
- Yeah, about two, three years ago.
While you two were dating.
I drove a black Trans Am.
- You' re Rick Daress?
- Yeah.
- You know him?
- Yeah.
- Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
You used to fuck Caitlin Bree while I was dating her?
Nah, man, don' t let it bother you.
I' m surprised you didn' t know about it, Dante.
Everybody in school knew about it.
Jesus Christ!
What next?
- Here you go.
- What' s this?
- A fine for $500.
- What?
Five hundred bucks?
For violation of New Jersey Statute, Section 2A, Number 170/ 51.
Any person who sells or makes available tobacco, or tobacco- related products, to persons under the age of 18, is regarded as disorderly.
- What are you talkin 'about?
- An angry mother called the state division of taxation... and claimed that a Quick Stop employee... sold her four- year- old daughter a pack of cigarettes at 4: 00 today.
The New Jersey Division of Taxation called the Board of Health... and sent me down to issue a fine.
You claimed you were working here all day.
The fine is doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
But I didn' t sell any cigarettes to any kids!
You sold cigarettes to a four- year- old?
What a scumbag!
I didn' t sell cigarettes to any kids!
This summons cannot be contested in any court of law.
Failure to remit before the due date... will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest.
- But I didn' t sell any cigarettes to any kids.
Forget it.
I don' t wanna deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to four- year- olds.
Can I, uh, give you a lift somewhere?
How 'bout the beach?
I like the way you think.
Jesus!
What next?
- [Woman]
- What?
- When did you get home?
- Just now.
I can' t believe it.
Dante, you have a customer.
I just saw Alyssa' s Little sister outside.
- She was with Rick Daress.
- How' d you get home?
- Train. it took eight hours.
- I can' t believe you' re here.
Do you have --
Back behind the oil.
How long you staying?
Until Monday.
Then I have to take the train back.
Pack of cigarettes.
Hey, congratulations.
I saw the announcement in today' s paper.
You know, she' s marrying an Asian design major.
You' re just gonna close the store like that?
I wanna talk to you about something, and I don' t wanna be disturbed.
Something I read in the tabloids.
- You saw it.
- Very dramatic, I thought. - it is not what you think.
- Oh, it' s not what I think.
What is it, worse?
You' re pregnant with the Asian design major' s child?
- What' s goin 'on here?
Were you gonna tell me, or were you gonna send me an invitation?
I was gonna tell you, but we were getting along so well, I didn' t wanna mess it up.
You could' ve started by telling me you had a boyfriend.
I told you I had a girlfriend.
I' m sorry, but when we started talking, it was like I forgot I had a boyfriend.
- And then he proposed last month.
Well, kind of.
Sort of.
Is that what they teach you in that school of yours?
"Kind of," "sort of"?
Everybody knows about this except me!
I would' ve told you, and you would' ve stopped calling me, like a baby.
- How do you know that?
You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
- So you' re really getting married?
- You' re not really getting married?
The story goes like this:
He proposed, I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted that I wear the ring anyway.
Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
- Then my mother called this morning... to let me know that the announcement was in the paper.
That' s when I hopped a train to come back here, because I knew you' d be a wreck.
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- Was I right?
"Disturbed" is more like it.
Oh, I love a macho facade.
- What smells like shoe polish?
- So you came here to what?
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
- But you were!
Not really.
Yeah, but not seriously.
Christ, you' re ready to walk down the aisle.
I think that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
- What' s going on?
- I' m giving him his ring back.
- [Sighs]
I don' t want to get married now.
I want to go to grad school after this, and then I want to start a career.
I don' t want to be a wife first and then have to worry about... when I' m gonna fit in the other stuff.
I have come way too far and studied too damn hard... to let my education go to waste as a housewife.
And I know that' s what I' d become.
Sang' s just signed with a major firm, and he' s gonna be pulling in a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work.
- He' s very traditional.
- His name is "Sang"?
Past tense?
Well, if he' s so nice, why aren' t you marrying him?
- I just told you.
- There' s more to this, isn' t there?
Why, Mr. Hicks, whatever do you mean?
- Tell me I don' t have something to do with it.
- You have nothing to do with it.
- Oh, you lie!
- Look how full of yourself you are!
I just believe in giving credit where credit' s due, and I believe I' m the impetus behind your refusal to wed.
If I' m so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
I had to knock you down from that cloud you were floating on.
When I say I don' t want to get married, I mean just that.
I don' t want to marry anybody.
Who' s asking?
Well, good.
Keep in that frame of mind.
Veronica, they' d love that.
We can introduce the two of them.
You' re serious?
You wanna date again?
It' s just the shock of seeing me after three years.
- Believe me, you' il get over it.
- Give me a bit more credit.
I think it' s time we got back together.
I' m more mature, you' re more mature.
You' re finishing college.
- I' m already in the job market.
Tell me you wouldn' t wanna go out with me again... after all the talking we' ve been doing.
The key word here is "talk," Dante.
I think the idea, or the conception of us dating, is a lot more idyilic than what actually happens when we date.
What are we supposed to do?
I don' t know.
Maybe we should just see what happens.
- Let me take you out tonight.
- On a date?
Yeah, a real date.
Oh, the "Dante Hicks Dinner and Movie" date.
- I think I' ve been on that one before.
Walk On The Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere "kind of private date?
- I hear that' s kind of a popular date.
- Jerk!
God, here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you' re calling me a slut in so many words.
- What about Sing?
- Sang!
- He' s not invited.
I' m offering you my body, and you' re offering me semantics.
He' s just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven' t gotten the drift... of why I came all the way here from Ohio --
Duh!
And, yes, allow me to placate your ego.
You are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision... that will probably get me ostracized from both school and home.
You ask me who I choose.
I choose you.
- So, what are you saying?
- You are such an asshole.
- I' m just kidding!
- I can already see this is not gonna work out.
- I' il ask Randal to close up when he gets back.
- Where is he, anyway?
He went to go rent a movie.
Ah, screw it.
You are too responsible.
But no, I have to go home first.
They don' t even know I' ve left school yet.
And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is gonna cause quite a row considering she loves Sang.
- Who doesn' t?
So I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time, yes, I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
I' m easy, but I' m not that easy.
- Get to work.
Best of Both Worlds?
Hermaphroditic porn.
You should see the box.
Beautiful chicks with dicks that put mine to shame.
- And you rented this?
- I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
- No way.
- Five hundred dollars.
- You' re bullshittin '.
Holy shit!
I didn' t even think they enforced this.
- Living proof.
- I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
- I didn' t.
Yep.
A little girl, maybe four years old.
- Yeah, as opposed to hundreds of other children... you' ve sold cigarettes while working here.
- Then how come you got the fine?
- You' re lyin '.
- No, I' m not.
- Why aren' t you screaming at me now?
- I' m happy.
- No, because Caitlin came to see me.
- Now I know you' re lyin '.
- I' m not.
She' s not marrying that guy.
She went home to tell her mom.
- You' re kiddin '.
- I' m not.
She went home and she' s getting ready and we' re going out.
I feel so ineffectual.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Watch the store while I go home and change?
Well, this is my way of spitting water at life.
All right.
No, I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case, you' re gonna lock up the store tonight.
All right, but you' re missin 'out.
Well, Randal Graves, scourge of the video renter.
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Asian Design Major herself, Caitlin Bree.
God, isn' t it awful?
My mother sent that in.
- I take it she likes the guy.
- You' d think she' s marrying him.
- What are you watching?
What' d your mom say when you told her you weren' t engaged anymore?
She said not to come home until after graduation.
What can I say?
- Ooh, can I watch?
- You can hold me down.
- Can I join in?
- I' m not a hermaphrodite.
What makes you think you can maintain a relationship with him this time around?
A woman' s intuition.
Something inside of me says it' s time to give the old boy a serious try.
Hey, you know, you and I have something in common.
- We both eat Chinese.
Dick.
- Exactly.
- So where is he?
He went home to change for the big date.
- No.
Oh, lord.
Can I use your bathroom?
- There' s no lights back there.
There are, but for some reason they stop working at 5: 14 every night.
- You' re kidding.
The boss doesn' t want to pay the electrician to fix it...
'cause the electrician owes money to the video store.
- Such a sordid state of affairs.
- And I' m caught in the middle, torn between my loyalty for the boss and my desire to piss with the lights on.
Well, I' il try to manage.
Oh, hey, Caitlin?
Break his heart again this time, and I' il kill ya.
You are very protective of him, Randal.
Territoriality.
He was mine first.
[Bed Squeaking, People Moaning On Video]
Who eats cock?
Hey, Caitlin' s in the back.
You might want to check on her.
- She' s been back there a long time.
- There are no lights back there.
I told her that.
She said she didn' t need any.
Why don' t you go join her?
Oh, I love your sexy talk.
It' s so kindergarten.
[Woman Moaning On Video]
How did you get here so fast?
Do you always talk this weird after you violate a woman?
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium.
- Could be. - it has never been like that before.
Like what?
When you just lay perfectly still and let me do everything.
Am I missing something here?
I went back there and Dante was already waiting for me.
- He was? - it was so cool.
[Sighs]
You know.
And, like, we didn' t kiss or talk or anything.
You dog!
The fact that there weren' t any lights on made it so --
God, that was so great!
- it wasn' t me.
- [Scoffs]
Yeah, right.
Who was it, then?
- Was it you?
- I was up here the whole time.
- You two better quit it.
- I' m serious.
Oh, so we didn' t just have sex in the bathroom?
Stop it.
I' m not fooling around.
I just came in from outside.
- This isn' t fucking funny, Dante.
- I' m not kidding.
- Who went back there?
- Nobody.
- I feel nauseous.
Well, I didn' t just fuck myself!
- God, I' m gonna be sick!
- Shut the fuck up!
- I can' t believe this.
- Call the police.
- No, don' t!
He just raped Caitlin!
- She said she did all the work.
- Will you shut the fuck up?
[Woman]
Who is he?
I don' t know.
He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
- What time was this?
- I don' t know.
What time did hockey end?
Um, like 3: 00, 3: 30.
- What time we get back from the funeral?
- Wait.
Who was working here?
I thought you just said you went to play hockey and then went to a funeral.
- Yeah, we did.
- Then who was operating the store?
- Nobody. it was closed.
Well, everything happened so quickly, I guess I forgot he was back there.
- [Man]
Was he alive when Caitlin --
No.
I place the time of death about 3: 20.
The body can maintain an erection after expiration, sometimes for hours.
Did he have the adult magazine when he came in?
He asked me for it.
I can' t say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is... he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died.
[Sniffing]
Uh, something smells Like shoe polish.
This has got to be the weirdest thing you' ve ever been called in on.
Actually, I once had to tag a kid that broke his neck trying to put his mouth on his penis.
What about Caitlin?
Shock trauma.
My question is:
How did she come to have sex with a dead man?
What kind of convenience store do you run here?
Salsa shark.
Man goes into cage, cage goes into salsa.
Oh, what?
What' s with you, man?
You haven' t said anything for, like, 20 minutes.
What the hell' s your problem?
- [Sighs]
- "This life"?
Why do I have this life?
I' m stuck in this pit, working for less than slave wages, working on my day off.
The goddamn steel shutters are closed.
I deal with every backward- assed fuck on the planet.
My ex- girlfriend is catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked 36 dicks.
- My life' s in the shitter right now, and if you don' t mind, I' d like to stew a bit.
- [Man]
[Randal]
Aw, that' s all bullshit, man.
- You know what the real problem here is?
- You should shit or get off the pot.
- Yeah, shit or get off the pot.
I' m talking about this thing you have, this inability to improve your station in life.
- Fuck you! - it' s true, man.
You sit there and blame life for dealin 'you a cruddy hand, never once accepting responsibility for the way your situation is.
- All right, if you hate this job and the people... and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, why don' t you quit?
- Like it' s that easy. - it is.
There' s other jobs.
You' re bound to be qualified for at least one of 'em.
So what' s stoppin 'you?
- Leave me alone.
This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it... would shatter the pathetic microcosm you' ve fashioned for yourself.
Oh!
Like your life' s any better.
I' m satisfied with my situation for now.
You don' t hear me complaining.
Thank you.
Why don' t you go back to the video store? - it' s the same thing with Veronica.
You date Veronica because it' s convenient and she' s low maintenance.
But meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin.
You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school. - in high school, for God' s sakes.
If you want Caitlin, then talk to Veronica and be with Caitlin.
If you want Veronica, then be with Veronica.
But don' t pine for one and fuck the other.
Man, if you weren' t such a fucking coward --
It must be great to have this ability to simplify things the way you do.
- Am I right or what?
Things happened today.
Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
Oh, what, the dead guy?
She' il get over fuckin 'a dead guy.
Shit, my mom' s been fuckin 'a dead guy for 30 years.
Caitlin and I can' t be together.
Melodrama comin 'from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
What do you want me to say?
That' s the way things are.
They' re not gonna change.
- Make 'em change.
- I can' t, all right?
Jesus, will you leave me alone?
But I don' t have the ability to risk the comfortable situations... on the big money and the fabulous prizes!
You can so.
So you' re gonna be miserable 'cause you don' t have the guts to face change?
My mother told me once that when I was three years old, my potty lid was closed, and instead of me lifting it, I shit my pants.
The point is, I' m not the type of person... who' il disrupt things just so I can shit comfortably.
<MUSlC> Doin 'coke, drinkin' beers <MUSlC> Pack o '"rass," my good man.
Time to kick back, drink some beers and smoke some weed!
Done poisoning the youth for today, huh?
Now it' s time to head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped and, hopefully, get laid.
- [Dante]
- Pay the good man.
- Yeah, you close soon? - in half an hour.
Yeah, we get off the same time every day.
- We should hang out.
You get high?
Wanna come to this party tonight?
There' s gonna be some pussy there.
Oh, look at you.
- Nothing personal.
- What happened with that old guy?
- He died in the bathroom.
I don' t know.
He probably saw that Caitlin chick.
I know I felt like beatin 'it when I saw her.
Oh, come here, bitch.
You like this?
- Knock it off.
That used to be my girlfriend, all right?
Oh, you used to go out with her?
Yeah, well, I thought we might be starting again.
- Don' t you already have a girlfriend?
Yeah, Veronica.
- And what, you' re gonna dump her for that Caitlin chick?
That Caitlin chick' s nice, but I see that Veronica girl... doin 'shit for you all the time.
I saw her rubbin 'your back, fuckin' comes and brings your food.
- Didn' t I see her change your tire once?
- Hey, I jacked up the car.
- Well, I know she does a lot for you.
I had some girlfriends too, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.
Shit, my grandmother used to say, "What' s better?
Fuckin 'a good plate with nothin' on it? "
"What' s a good plate with nothin 'on it?"
She was senile.
She used to fuckin 'piss herself all the time... and shit herself.
Come on, Silent Bob.
Let' s get the fuck outta this fuckin 'gyp joint... with this fuckin' faggot Dante.
You know, there' s a million fine- lookin 'women in the world, dude, but they don' t all bring ya Lasagna at work.
Most of 'em just cheat on ya.
He' s right.
I love her.
He doesn' t love you anymore.
He loves Caitlin.
All except the latent homosexuality part.
That' s just my theory.
Don' t hold it against him.
It' s not your fault. it' s Dante.
I- Look.
So if you gotta cry or something, I can get outta here.
- I' m not sad.
Ow!
What' d you do that for?
If you didn' t wanna go out with me anymore, why didn' t you say so?
Instead you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
- What are you talking about?
- You' ve been talking to her on the phone for weeks! - it was only a few times.
- Then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I' ve gone down a couple of guys.
- I' m not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back!
If you think 37 dicks are a lot, just wait and see, mister.
I' m going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
- Explain what?
How you' ve been waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her? - it isn' t like that!
- Damn right it isn' t like that!
Because I won' t let it be like that.
You want your slut?
Fine, the slut is yours.
- I don' t want Caitlin.
But I' m not going to sit here holding your hand anymore until you figure it out!
I' ve tried with you, Dante.
I' ve encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction.
I even transferred so maybe you' d be more inclined... to go back to college if I was with you.
Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn' t care... because I loved you and wanted to see you... pull yourself out of this senseless funk that you' ve been in... since that whore dumped you oh, so many years ago.
Now you wanna go back to her so she can fuck you over some more!
- I don' t wanna go back -- - Of course not!
Not now!
You' re caught, and now you' re trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do!
I want you to follow through on this so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are!
And when she dumps you again -- and I promise you, she will --
I want to laugh in your face so you realize that... that was what you gave up our relationship for!
I' m just glad that Randal had the balls to tell me since you couldn' t!
- Randal?
- You' re spineless!
- Veronica, I love you!
Dante?
<MUSlC> You' il all be replaced <MUSlC><MUSlC>
The swelling' s not that bad, but the F. D. S. stings.
- How' s your neck? - it' s kinda hard to swallow.
You didn' t have to choke me, you know.
Why did you tell Veronica that I was gonna dump her to go back with Caitlin?
- Oh, Jesus.
You' re always saying how you can' t initiate change yourself.
I thought I' d give you a hand.
Thanks.
Oh, please.
I' m surprised I didn' t kill you.
- Why do I say that?
- No, really.
What did I do that was so wrong?
Sometimes I think the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
- How do you figure?
- What time did you get to work today?
Like 10: 00, or ten after.
You were over a half an hour late.
And then all you do is come in here.
- Yeah, to talk to you.
- Which means the video store is ostensibly closed!
Oh, it' s not like I' m miles away.
- Hermaphrodites.
I rented it so we could watch it together.
- You get me slapped with a fine.
You get us thrown out of a funeral by violating the corpse.
Then to top it all off, you ruin my relationship.
Do you, like, anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?
You know what the real tragedy about all of this is?
Oh, fuck you!
Fuck you, pal!
Jesus, there you go, trying to pass the buck.
Who closed the store to play hockey?
Who closed the store to go to a wake?
Who tried to win back his ex- girlfriend... without even discussing how he felt with his present one?
Blame yourself.
"I' m not even supposed to be here today."
You sound like an asshole!
Jesus, nobody twisted your arm to be here.
You like to think the weight of the world rests on your shoulder,
Like this place would fall apart if Dante wasn' t here.
You push fuckin 'buttons.
You' re so obsessed with making it seem so much more epic, so much more important than it really is.
Christ, you work in a convenience store, Dante, and badly, I might add!
I work in a shitty video store, badly as well.
You know, that guy Jay' s got it right.
He has no delusions about what he does.
Us, we like to make ourselves seem so much more important... than the people that come in here to buy a paper or, God forbid, cigarettes.
Well, if we' re so fuckin 'advanced, what are we doin' workin 'here?
Hey, the floor looks pretty clean.
I put the cat next door.
- Need a ride home?
Just pulled up.
You workin 'tomorrow?
Same time.
I' m callin 'out.
Goin 'to the hospital and visit Caitlin.
You wanna grab a bite to eat or something... when you' re done with that and I get off work?
- I' il give you a call, let you know.
- All right.
Hey, good luck with Veronica.
- lf you want, I can talk to her, try and straighten this -- - No, thanks.
I think I can handle it.
We have a lot of shit to talk about.
- Hell of a day.
- To say the least.
Want me to do anything before I get out of here, man?
Why don' t you wrangle for me?
No.
Just wrangle out the door.
- No.
You' re closed.
I know you don' t smoke weed.
'cause it' s Friday, you ain' t got no job, and you ain' t got shit to do.
# Got my mind
lots of hot sauce, and all the fries you can give me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Friday is just the day before the weekend.
But after this Friday, the neighbourhood will never be the same.
Oh, shit.
What' s up?
Good morning.
Are you prepared for Jehovah' s return?
I have a pamphlet here that...
Well, fuck you.
Half- dead motherfucker.
Come on, sister.
Come on, sister.
Yeah.
Uh- oh.
I gotcha.
Gotcha baby.
That' s right.
Damn.
Ain' t nothin 'in this house.
Shit.
Every time I come in the kitchen, you in the kitchen...
In the goddamn refrigerator, eating up all the food...
All the chicken, all the pig feet, all the collard green, all the hog maws.
I wanna eat some of them chit' lins.
I love pig feet.
Now, when I went to bed last night, didn' t I tell you to take out the trash?
Yeah.
So why didn' t you do it?
I fell asleep.
I wish you was sleeping right now.
I' d knock you upside your head with a left, make your ass wake up and take out the trash!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing?
I' m throwing this away.
We ain' t even got no milk.
You put some water on that damn shit.
Alright.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

Dizam.
What is wrong with him?
Hurry up with the garbage!
I got some more work for you!
What' s up, Craig?
Don' t "what' s up" me.
I need to whoop your little ass for knocking over these trash cans last week.
Don' t knock these over.
Ain' t nobody gonna knock over your stupid trash cans.
You better not.
Get your bad ass to school anyway.
Man, shut up, punk!
What?
I' m gonna knock over your trash cans anyway.
Little bastard.
Hey, Mama.
Hi, baby.

Mom, you got some glue?

My track slipped out.
Go look in my dresser.
You need a wig.
You need a job.
Mama, you didn' t tell Daddy what happened yesterday, did you?
You know I wouldn' t tell on my baby.
Cool!

Huh?

Where you at?
In the bathroom!
Oh, man.
I' il wait till you come out.
Boy, bring your ass in here.

I smelled your shit for 22 years.
Now you can' t smell mine for 5 minutes?
Shut the door.
Your mama told me what happened to you yesterday.

That was stupid.
How the hell you get fired on your day off?
I don' t know.
Well, you need a trade.
Take a look at that paper over there.
(Grunts) On the counter there.
I ain' t trying to be no dog catcher.
Why not?
I don' t even like dogs.
That' s the beauty of it!
I grab a dog, and I choke him, and I kick the shit out of him, and all day long, my foot up a dog' s ass!
Just bang, bang, bang up his ass!
That' s my pleasure!
I don' t think so.
I tell you one thing.
Around here, you gonna work or go to school.
The first of the month, the rent is due.
If you ain' t got nothin 'on the table, you ain' t got to worry about catchin' a dog.
You gotta worry about a dog catching your ass!
Craig, telephone!
(Grunts)
Hello.

I didn' t go to the show last night.
You ain' t got to lie, Craig.

Protection?
Protection from who?

I got to walk Smokey down to his house.
Aw, man. your mother and I never would have moved into this neighborhood if we had known you' d need a gun to walk down the damn street.
You know how it is around here.
Oh, no, son, that' s not the way it is.
Kids today are nothing but punks, sissified, so quick to pick up a gun.
You scared to take an ass whippin '.
This is what makes you a man.
When I was growing up, this was all the protection we needed.
You win some, you lose some.
But you live...
You live to fight another day.
You think you' re a man with that gun in your hand, don' t you?
I' m a man without it.
Put the gun down.
Put up your dukes.
Now you' re a man.
Your uncle picked up a gun too.
He had to find out the hard way.
22 years old.
You got a choice.
These are all you need.
Alright?
What' s up, man?
What' s up, Red?
Ah ah ah!
Get your ass up.
They was clownin 'you at work today.

Oh, it' s cool.
Damn!
Damn!
Put your glasses back on.
What' s up, Craig?
What' s up, Red?
Hey, Smokey, sell me a dub!
Ain' t selling you nada.
Come on, homes.
Let' s let bygones be bygones.
Raise the fuck up before Craig' s father come out here.
You need to go and do that.
Hell, I ain' t selling him shit.
You better get your ass off your shoulders.
You ain' t going to get me shot up.
You better make that money.

Give it up, Red.
Come on, Deebo, stall him out.
What you got on my 40, homie?
I don' t have nothin '.
Yeah, you got something.
Why you trippin ', Deebo?
Shut up, or I knock your ass out.
Why don' t you give him back his chain?
What chain?
Yeah, what chain?
Man, why y' all didn' t help me?
Man, I' m high.
That' s fucked up.
I would have helped y' all.
What about the time he tried to choke me in smoke' s backyard?
Oh, that was different.
Man, let' s jump him.
Sit your ass down.
Man, I got mind control over Deebo.
He be, like, "shut the fuck up," I be quiet.
But when he leaves, I be talkin 'again.
Man, my grandmama gave me that chain.
Man, he trippin 'hard.
Only on people he know.
He don' t be pullin 'that shit on them fools around the corner.
Man, fuck that!
He going to cry in the car.

Then I' m going home to chill.
You wait for them niggers.
Later on, call me and let me know what happened.
You' re making me nervous, ok?
I' m trippin 'out, scared as shit.
Stop!
Alright.
Damn!
What car is that?

Hey, hold up.
I' il be right back.
Smoke, hey, see if she got a friend.
Alright.
Ooh, what' s up?
Not a damn thing.
So we going to kick it, or what?
We can kick it, but I forgot I had to go pick up my mom from work, and you know how that is.
I' il take you to get her.
She don' t like a lot of people with me when I go get her.
Who' s that girl Smokey' s talking to?
Some girl he hooked up with.
She' s a big one.
Humongous.
Why don' t you go get something to eat?
Lord, let me go inside and see what' s going on with this crazy man.
I' m right behind you.
Uh- uh, 'cause, see, I ate twice before I came.
God damn!
Craig, where the iron?
Right there.
Hey, Dana.
What?
Loan me $200.
Me and Smokey got into it with Big Worm today.
We owe him $200.
He said if we don' t pay him, he going to kill us.
So you going to loan me the money or not?
Not.
You going to call me?
I' m going to call you.
But if you come by, I won' t call you.
OK?
Don' t ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever come by here.
OK?

Alright.

Craig, telephone.
Who is it?
That girl.
Tell her I' il call her back.
OK.
Hey, Mama.

If I was working, I wouldn' t need $200.
Exactly.
Y' all ain' t never got no money!
I hate to live with a bunch of broke- ass people.
Shit!
Come here!
What?
Why you hook me up with that fat- ass baldhead girl?
Who?
Rita?
Yeah.
Rita is not fat.
She' s just big boned.
Shit!
That girl wider than all outside.
Talkin 'about she looked like Janet Jackson.
Oh, no, she didn' t go there.
Iooking more like Freddie Jackson.
Don' t laugh. it ain' t funny.
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
I' m not trying to laugh.
I just thought that you two would like each other.
You knew she was baldheaded.
You knew she had no damn hair.
Don' t laugh.
It ain' t funny.
Ooh, I' m sorry.

Yeah.
Deebo was over Felisha and Debbie house asleep.
I snuck through the back window to get the money out of his pants, and little Ezel come through the window and woke him up.
I tried to beat his ass, but he ran.
You ain' t catching no crack head.

Let' s just go over.
He' s probably still asleep. you breaking in, though.
You going to be with me?

You want to go in the house and lay down?

She ain' t seen him, and Deebo ain' t seen him.
See why you have to tell us before you leave?
Look at your face!
It' il be OK.
No, look at your face.
Who do you think you are?
What are you talking about?
You know what I' m talking about, punk.
You hit my sister like she was a fucking man.
She had no business going through my pants.
My sister don' t need to steal nothing from your broke ass.
Take your ass home.
I' m not scared of you.
All these niggers around here might be scared of you, but I' m not.
You take your ass home.
No, fuck you.
Otherwise I' d kick your ass myself.
Shut up!
Deebo, man, you trippin '.

Man, that' s a female.
Shut your little punk ass up, nigger, before I drop you like I did this bitch.

What are you going to do with that...... besides make me mad?
Put the gun down, son.
Put the gun down, son.

Put that gun down, son, and get knocked down like your father used to.
This was all the protection we needed.
You win some, you lose some.
But you live...

You think you' re a man with that gun in your hand, don' t you?
I' m a man without it.
Yeah.
Put that gun down, son.
And get knocked down like your father used to.

The payback' s a motherfucker, ain' t it?
Shana, come on.

My grandmama gave me this chain.
Deebo!
Deebo!
Man, you should have been bobbing and weaving.
Look at you.
Get up!
Since you ain' t, I' il take these shoes.
Big foot motherfucker, you can have your knife.
'Cause I steal, I don' t kill.
How' s your back feeling?
It' il be cool.
Bleeding and shit.
What time you waking up in the morning?
8: 30.
Why?
I was just wondering if maybe you were feeling better, then, um, you could come over.
I' m feeling better already.
I' m going to call you tomorrow.
Alright.
8: 30, right?
Yes.
Hey... 7: 30.
That' s right.
Hello?
Why you can' t call nobody back?
Which one of your hos has somebody shooting at you?
I don' t know why I waste my time on your old stupid ass anyway.
I don' t know either.
It' s over.
Bitch!
Yeah, I got your money, and I don' t appreciate you sending your punk ass, buster ass, jheri curl ass friends to shoot at me and my homie.
They liked to got dealt with.
'cause I' il cut your balls off and hand them to you, partner.
I had to warn you too many times about my money, Smokey.
It' s the principle of the whole thing.
There' s principalities in this.
Well, yeah.
'cause I' m going to rehab.
I' m through with this shit.
I was just bullshittin ', and you know this, man.
Woe unto man.
Brave Achilles, slain in trial by blood.
lost victim of bewildered desire.
Nor has Jason' s wife fared better, giving life, only to reclaim it, in vengeful fury.
For to understand the ways of the heart is to grasp as clearly the malice or ineptitude of the gods.
Who in their vain and clumsy labours to create a flawless surrogate have left mankind but dazed and incomplete.
Take for instance the case of Lenny Weinrib, a tale as Greek and timeless as fate itself.
- Lenny, let' s have a baby.
- Hey..!
Because she' s pregnant, you want to have a baby?
You could raise your own middleweight.
- I don' t want a middleweight.
- Flyweight.
- It' d be fun.
- Have you ever had children?
- No.
I never... never had children.
- Why not?
Why not?
My first wife didn' t want to have a child, and then I never remarried...
What am I?
Chopped liver?
Until now.
You didn' t let me finish.
You changed your mind.
You didn' t want to have a child.
You should have kids.
Give him a break.
You don' t want a kid?
When we first met, she didn' t like the beach.
She hated the Hamptons.
She didn' t want to have kids.
She loved the Upper East Side.
Suddenly she' s making noise about having a kid and moving to Tribeca.
Only if the gallery moves downtown.
Being pregnant is great.
You get treated like the Queen of England.
You say that like it' s a good thing.
Well, I love the pampering.
- Yeah?
- It' s fantastic.
I can' t give up the time.
There are too many exciting things happening in my business.
- Let me ask you a question.
- What?
How do you plan to swing it without being pregnant?
That' s a very good question.
It' s easy.
We' il adopt.
- Oh, well...
- Not me.
I don' t want to adopt.
- Why not?
- No.
- That' s a good idea.
You must be nuts.
To adopt?
I have award- winning genes.
I' m going to pass them on.
That' s crazy.
It' s for the same reason we don' t lease the car.
'Cause it' s pride of ownership.
And I don' t want to adopt a child.
Sorry, Lenny, but it' s crazy, because the world is full of needy kids.
- That' s true.
I know, but... you know...
Why overpopulate the world when there are thousands of parentless kids?
It' s because you don' t want to get morning sickness.
That' s not true.
I just can' t afford to give up a year.
Well, forget it.
The subject is closed.
I' d be afraid that I might get a bad seed.
- Oh, come on.
- That' s paranoid.
He' s right.
You read that in the tabloids all the time.
We adopt some sweet little boy, he turns 13, we go to sleep at night, he' d split our head open with an axe.
- Why' d you tell him that?
- It' s a common occurrence.
I been to the same Payco.
What do you mean, he?
Why can' t we adopt a girl?
We' re not adopting anything.
Let the guy have a shortstop or point guard.
Can we get the check?
I' il take the check.
I' m paying tonight.
- Yes.
- I' m stunned.
You pay, you break your record.
One more and you break DiMaggio' s record 56 straight.
Now be nice.
Laius, proud father, speak!
I with joy did have a son, so fair, so clear- headed, and brave, that I a thousand pleasures did derive from his presence.
So what happens?
And don' t you think, he runs off and marries my wife.
Poor Oedipus.
King of Thebes.
And did without realizing hasten with me his loving mother, to lustful bed.
And a whole profession was born, charging sometimes 200 an hour, and a 50- minute hour at that.
And why a child now, out of left field?
One hopes it' s not to fill some growing void in their marriage.
Leave her be.
A woman' s urge to motherhood is old as the earth.
Children grow up!
They move out!
Sometimes to ridiculous places, like Cincinnati.
Or Boise, Idaho.
Then you never see them again.
You' d think once in a while they' d pick up a phone.
But is there a growing void in the Weinrib' s marriage?
We didn' t say there was.
We' re all just speculating on possible motives.
Children are serious stuff.
Look!
Here' s a man who killed his father, and slept with his mother.
I hate to tell you what they call my son in Harlem.
Hello.
There' s a baby we can adopt.
Are you serious?
I spoke to Carolyn Hester and she' s found an infant for us.
But we have to act quickly.
I don' t want a kid.
Lenny, you know how hard it is.
Unwed mother, no diseases.
And it' s a boy!
You wanted a boy.
I can' t get into this with you now.
This is not the place to have this discussion.
I told Carolyn to be on the lookout.
She' s experienced with adoption.
Healthy.
Born this morning.
No strings.
If we act quickly.
Look, look...
I gotta put my foot down.
I...
But if you gotta have a fast answer, it' s definitely no.
- Got his head?
- He' s adorable.
Oh, God, this is great.
This kid is never gonna be a fighter.
I gotta run out and get some weights.
Because he' s really... he' s light as a feather.
Yeah.
He' s...
He' s crying.
It' s okay.
let it pass into your body.
Get a grip on yourself.
This kid is going to be a great kid.
He' s fabulous.
What do you want to call him?
- This is unbelievable.
- Call him?
What about Eric?
Eric?
The kid' s not a viking.
I want to call him after one of my heroes.
Like what?
I don' t know.
What about Groucho?
Groucho?
Oh, get real.
It' s a great, you know...
I don' t know.
What about Phineas?
Do you like Phineas?
- Phineas?
Are you joking?
- Yeah, call him Phineas.
Phineas is the guy who forecloses on the mortgage.
I don' t want to call this kid Phineas.
That' s so great.
What... let me think.
What about Django?
- Django?
- Django, yeah.
After Django Reinhardt, the great guitar...
Django Weinrib?
That' s the curse of the Weinrib name.
It doesn' t go with anything.
Nothing works with Weinrib.
Okay, what about something simple, like Ben?
Ben?
You want to call him Ben Weinrib?
What' s he going to be, a gin rummy champion?
You want to deny your heritage?
You know, I just want the kid to have a great name.
What about Sugar Ray Weinrib?
Holden, after Holden Caulfield.
Holden' s one of those things that works if we use your maiden name, if it' s Holden Sloan, but not Holden Weinrib.
The kid is so cute.
I can' t believe this.
What about Cole?
Cole Weinrib?
Harpo Weinrib.
How about Earl the Pearl Weinrib?
- That would be so perfect.
- Oh, God.
What about Shane?
Do you like the name Shane?
- Yeah, Shane' s pretty.
- Shane would be okay.
On the other hand you wouldn' t want a supreme court justice called Shane.
Oh, Jesus.
I got it!
I got it!
Brilliant.
This is so brilliant.
Got it?
Ready?
Are you ready?
- Thelonius Weinrib.
- Max!
What about Max?
- Max?
- Yeah, Max.
Look how cute he is.
I want to hold him.
- Max is okay.
- Look.
He' s smiling.
Doctor Max Weinrib.
I like the name Max.
- Max is good.
It' s simple.
- How about Senator Max Weinrib?
Rabbi Max...
Rabbi Max Weinrib?
Maybe we should rethink Max.
- He' s happy.
- He' s so great.
I think he likes us.
He looks like you.
- He looks like me?
- Yeah.
He looks like Robert Crawford a little bit.
- He' s so smart.
- Yeah.
He picks up on everything.
He' s got a great personality.
You wake him up, he' s always smiling.
You were like that when you were a baby.
- He' s so verbal.
And an art expert, right?
Listen, when are you going to move the gallery downtown?
'cause, you know, I think we should move and Lenny is a devoted Upper East Sider...
Or shall I say is opposed to change in any form?
He' s unbelievable.
The kid is unbelievable.
He put 'em together.
He put the trains together himself.
I thought you bought him an erector set.
I got him an erector set.
And I also got him this tricycle.
- And the plastic kitchen?
- I got you a tricycle.
You can' t buy him so much.
- I got you a tricycle.
- Look at that.
- You can' t buy him so much.
- I also got him skates.
Skates?
Yeah, and I got a couple more things on the way...
A small truck is going to pull up in front of the house.
What are you going to get next year?
Want anything to drink?
Go ahead.
Shoot!
Try it again.
Ever think about what you want to be when you grow up?
I don' t know.
Maybe an interior decorator.
- What?!
Just kidding.
Come on.
Okay, those go in the bedroom.
You follow me.
- Give me a hand with this.
- Why did we move?
What do you mean why did we move?
I told you, we moved because... because... you know... your mother wanted to move, because the art gallery she works at has moved downtown and, you know, she wanted to move.
Who' s the boss between you and Mommy?
What is the question?
Who' s the boss between you and Mommy?
Who' s the boss?
You have to ask that?
- You don' t know who the boss is?
- No.
I' m the boss, okay?
Mommy' s only the decision maker.
You know, there' s a difference between...
Mommy says what we do, and I have control of the channel changer.
- Here' s your crayons.
- Thanks.
We' re new in the neighbourhood.
We want Max to be in the best school.
- This is it.
- Because he' s a very very bright kid.
- Really bright.
- Yes, I know.
I saw his test scores, and they' re wonderful.
- They are.
- He' s got a great sense of humour.
- He' s a sweet kid.
- He' s got a great personality.
I wanted to talk to you about a special program we have for bright students.
- Really?
He qualifies?
Absolutely.
- Sorry.
- This is so great.
When you hear his syntax, it' s amazing.
Verbal skills are telling.
His vocabulary' s good, but his syntax... he speaks like a grown- up.
Lenny.
- What we can do...
- Sorry.
Excuse me.
- Certainly.
Can we meet the Dorans tonight for dinner at La Cirque?
No, because we have tickets to the Edward Albee.
- Listen, I can' t.
- You have to.
You don' t have to go, but I really should go.
- Go with Bud.
This is the second time this week we' ve cancelled something.
I' m not married to Bud.
Can we not discuss it now?
Oh, my God!
That was embarrassing.
Just because I don' t want to have dinner yet again with the world' s dullest couple.
Someday they may sponsor me for my own gallery.
I said I' m going with you, but we got tickets to a show...
This time, join in.
Don' t sit there like some zombie.
The last time I joined in you got angry.
Because we were discussing the I. M. Pei museum, not Muhammad Ali.
My mind wandered.
I can' t keep on those topics.
I just don' t want to be at the Bender Gallery forever.
I want the Amanda Sloan Gallery.
Not Amanda Weinrib, because there' s a euphony problem.
I hope they don' t play like this.
What' s the matter?
You seem down.
- Fine?
Something' s on your mind.
Amanda, you know, last week she took me to La Cirque with the Dorians.
Last night it was with the Grossbads on Park Avenue.
It was Saturday night, and we stopped for a light over on Park Avenue.
I looked out the window and I see some guy and this pretty girl.
They' re walking home, and, you know... and the guy' s carrying the Sunday papers.
They looked like they were having so much fun, you know?
I don' t know.
I remember how great it used to be with me and Amanda in our first apartment... how romantic it was.
ln those days it was just a kick shopping together, you know, just walking the New York streets.
You know, and then when Max came, it was... everything was so great.
We had such terrific times.
It' s been so long since there' s been... you know, passion between us.
I don' t know.
They made me feel nervous.
You weren' t too pleasant this evening.
Why?
'Cause I said no about going to your boss Jerry Bender' s house in the Hamptons?
I don' t like the Hamptons.
You used to hate the beach yourself.
Not the way he lives.
It' s private and beautiful.
What are you getting so angry about?
Last time we went I got a tick.
A tick?
Big deal.
- For you it wasn' t a big deal.
- Everyone will be there.
For the potential contacts I can put up with a few ticks.
It' s like you' re an international spy.
You' ve got contacts all over town.
I plan to have my own gallery!
You' ve changed unbelievably over the years.
You know what?
People grow.
Some people.
It' s not growth.
You used to hate the beach.
And Jerry Bender has got a crush on you...
What?!
That' s nuts.
This guy stares at you and mentally undresses you.
That' s his normal look.
If he looked at me like that I' d hit him with a brick.
- Or kiss him on the lips.
- Let' s drop this.
What do you mean, you couldn' t find it?
We haven' t done it in a while, and then you got so angry at me.
I wasn' t angry.
You were fumbling and I was getting out of the mood.
We haven' t been doing it in a while.
- I lost my sense of direction.
- Let' s not get into it.
I' m tired.
Every marriage goes through valleys and peaks.
This is like a valley.
I don' t mind going through a valley, but not sinking beneath sea level.
Why rock the boat?
You got a bright, beautiful wife.
You got a kid you' re crazy for.
Did I tell you about Max?
They want to put him in a special class because he' s got a high IQ.
- Two bright parents...
- Whoever they are.
I still don' t know.
It' s like raising thoroughbreds.
This kid must come from good stock.
He' s good looking.
He' s got a high I. Q.
He' s got a great personality and he' s amusing.
This is not my doing.
Amanda did the whole adoption.
I complained, like a jerk.
I mean a good father, a dynamite mother produces a kid like Max.
I think the father' s dead, but..... the mother...
Don' t go any further.
I know what you' re thinking, Lenny, and forget it.
How can I forget it?
The thought' s been put into my head.
Oh, cursed fate.
Certain thoughts are better left unthunk.
I' il bet this kid has a dynamite mother.
What makes you think he didn' t inherit everything from his father?
Everything?
That' s very unlikely.
But I' m going to find out.
Let sleeping dogs lie!
- I' il bet she' s great!
That' s what kills us.
Not muggers or all that bullshit about the ozone layer.
- It' s our own hearts and minds.
- I' m going to find out.
Please, Lenny, don' t be a schmuck.
I remember the adoption vaguely because I' m somewhat friendly with Amanda.
It was not that long ago that we did this.
I recall trying to expedite matters for her.
I somehow think it was a single parent, with no father.
Exactly.
So is it possible for me to get the name?
I' d like the name of the mother, if I could.
That remains forever in our files.
Even if I have it, I can' t give it to you.
May I ask why you want to know?
So...
Sorry, that' s all I can help you with.
There' s no possibility of... of...
Those are the rules.
I' m the father of the child.
I can' t find out who the m..?
It' s never done.
- How is the little boy doing?
He' s fabulous.
Say hello to Amanda.
- There' s no possibility that I could...
- I' m sorry.
No way.
Thank you.
- Bye- bye.
What are you doing, Weinrib?
Don' t confuse me.
She' s coming back in a minute.
You are breaking the law.
Breaking the law?
There' s a higher law.
I can find out who my son' s mother is.
A judge won' t see it that way.
Keep a lookout for me, for christ' s sake.
Me?
I' m the leader of the chorus.
So what?
Look out!
Get your friend Bud to help you.
Bud can' t help me.
Ellie and Amanda are friendly.
Bud can' t keep a secret.
Why is it a secret?
Why can' t Amanda know?
What kind of argument am I getting into?
Because she wouldn' t understand.
You' re guilty because you already have exaggerated notions about your son' s mother.
It' s understandable, because things are not going smoothly...
I act.
I take action.
I make things happen.
Hurry the hell up.
I hear footsteps.
It has an important interview in it.
You won' t believe this, but he' s heading for Pennsylvania.
Of all human weaknesses, obsession is the most dangerous.
And the silliest.
- Yeah?
Leslie Wright.
Who are you?
I' m a friend of hers, and I believe she lived here at one time.
A Leslie Wright?
Yeah, I remember a girl that used to live here.
The pretty one upstairs.
She was only here for a while.
- Who are you?
- Just an old friend.
I was trying to track her down.
Do you know where I could find her?
Leslie Wales was her name.
Not Leslie Wright.
Leslie Wales?
She moved to New York.
You sure?
'Cause I have a Leslie Wright.
Did she get married, or...
I don' t know.
Where I could find her?
No.
She was only here for a little while.
Let me give you my phone number.
If anything turns up, I would love to locate her.
I' il take that.
- Thank you.
- You' re welcome.
You have a phone call.
Mr. Lamont.
Says he' s from Philadelphia.
You gave him your number.
Is this Lenny Weinrib?
Go ahead, sir.
- Hello?
- This is Bill Lamont.
That woman you were looking for... we asked another guy who said her name was Leslie St. James.
Said she moved to New York City.
Talked about becoming an actress.
Leslie St. James?
Yes, sir.
He remembered her quite well.
Leslie St. James is the name she took.
There was a Leslie St. James who was a member of the Screen Extras Guild.
So that' s that.
So what are you telling me?
That she was a movie extra, or a stage extra?
That' s all I have.
And there' s an address, but, you know, this book' s a few years old.
So...
I' m looking for a Leslie St. James, or maybe Leslie Wales.
I don' t know, but I think she lived here.
Sure, I remember.
A tall girl.
She changed her name to Linda Ash.
- Linda Ash?
- Yeah.
It was a fake name.
She did sex movies.
Sex movies?
You know, like Deep Throat?
Skin flicks.
Tall.
Blonde.
Hot.
Very hot.
Really good- looking?
Great looking.
Tremendous body.
- How ya 'doin'?
- Hey, Lenny, how are ya?
- Good.
Can I talk to you a minute?
- Yeah.
I need a favour.
You got it.
What?
You got friends in the adult film business, right?
My nephew knows' em all.
Why?
I' m trying to locate an actress named Linda Ash.
You know which movie she did?
No.
I was in the video store, trying to get a video, but I get embarrassed because my neighbour saw me there...
I hear ya.
Let me get back to ya, Len.
I don' t know why we have to do this.
I don' t want to spend the whole weekend at Jerry Bender' s.
Please.
We' ve been through this.
There are lots of important clients there.
Meanwhile, this guy is going to stare at you the whole weekend and mentally undress you.
He is not.
God, you' re paranoia' s rivalled in history only by Joseph Stalin.
I' m glad you could make it out this weekend.
There are some people around here you should meet.
Thanks, Jerry.
I really do.
I love your sailboat.
It' s fun, isn' t it?
Sorry the waves were so choppy, Lenny.
It' s no problem.
I don' t mind throwing up into the wind.
You know, we could see that house next door at three o' clock.
- It' s a great...
- Could I make one quick phone call?
- Yeah.
Ken...
- Right here.
Could you show Lenny the private phone?
Sure.
It' s right over here.
What are they asking again?
Why don' t you spend the night here tonight?
We could go for a sail.
You can' t believe what the stars look like lying in the back of a boat.
I really would love to.
- Then do it.
- But I... he has to get back.
Really?
Yeah.
I got the skinny on Linda Ash.
She' s been in a few films.
She' s no star, or nothin '.
That' s why you never heard of her.
She works under the stage name Judy Cum.
Mostly, she' s a hooker.
I got her number.
Judy Cum?
You never should have looked for her.
Now I see big trouble.
Oh, for God' s sakes, you' re such a Cassandra.
I' m not such a Cassandra.
I am Cassandra.
That' s who I am.
- I gotta check this thing out.
- You' il be sorry.
I' m telling you, quit now.
Oh, and don' t let Amanda talk you into buying the house next door.
This place?
And a heavy mortgage.
Well, I love that property.
It' s right near everybody.
Doesn' t mean we have to see them all the time, but we have the option.
You... you' re not afraid of beach erosion, right?
Beach erosion?
You' re such a Cassandra.
- You going to take a shower?
- Yeah.
Yeah, can you...
- fix something for dinner?
- I' il make dinner.
I' il make the spaghetti, okay?
- Yeah.
There' s some sauce in the fridge.
Hello, is this Linda?
Linda, this is Lenny.
I got your number from Charlie Biggs.
And I wonder if it would be possible that you would have some time tomorrow afternoon.
- You shouldn' t do this.
- Would you please stop it?
- You' re going to cheat on Amanda?
I just want to see...
You can get a disease.
Aren' t you scared of AlDS?
I want to see what she looks like, get to know her.
Is it possible that we could meet at a hotel?
You' re going to rent a hotel room with a hooker and not sleep with her?
I want to talk to her.
How about the Plaza on 59th Street?
What are you doing?
At least pick an out- of- the- way spot.
Oh, Christ.
Linda, maybe it would be better if I...
What about your place?
Would that be a possibility?
Hold on one second.
Three o' clock.
Okay, um...
I' il be there, and it' s Lenny.
Lenny Gildersleeve.
Okay.
I can' t believe this.
I can' t believe it.
Hi.
Are you my three o' clock?
- Linda Ash?
- Yeah, that' s right.
I' m Lenny.
Hello, Lenny.
Come on in.
You' re Linda Ash, right?
- Yeah.
- 'Cause we spoke on the phone?
Yeah.
Are you okay?
You look all white.
I' m okay.
Do you want something to drink?
Do you have a little Perrier or something?
- What?
- A little tap water, or something?
I have that.
You' re definitely Linda Ash?
Yeah.
Are you a stroke victim or something?
I told you three times I' m Linda Ash.
Oh, you have a beautiful apartment.
Thank you.
I did it myself.
Let me show you something I just got.
That. lsn' t it a pisser?
It' s magnificent.
Yeah, I got a great sense of humour.
That' s something you' re going to find out about me.
A lot of people can' t.
They say that about me too.
- That I have a good sense of...
Then you' il like this.
Look.
I just got this.
Somebody gave it to me.
See?
As the mainspring goes back and forth, the bishop keeps fucking her in the ass.
It' s a genuine antique and it keeps perfect time.
My goodness, it' s disgusting...
Would you like some Sprite instead?
I' m feeling a little dizzy.
Oh, no.
Come sit down.
I don' t know why.
Usually, you know, I' m just the picture of health.
Yeah?
Do you work out?
Not religiously.
Oh, I' m not religious either.
Mostly my folks were Episcopalian.
Oh, are they?
- So...
- So...
So what do you do, Lenny?
No, wait.
Let me guess.
I have a great knack for guessing what people do for a living.
Rug salesman.
You' re close.
I' m a sportswriter.
Oh, shit.
I wasn' t even in the ball park.
Sportswriter.
Get it?
I get it.
I did it with a wrestler once... a huge, hairy guy.
You' d figure he' d be hung like a horse, but there was very little there.
Could I just get a little water?
I don' t care if it' s brown.
- I' m sorry.
- I don' t mind rust.
I' m just feeling a li...
Tell me, Linda...
Tell me about yourself, Linda.
What do you want to know?
Anything.
I' d just like to know about you.
- Well, basically...
- Yes?.. I' m an actress.
That' s wonderful.
I study.
Yes?
Where' s that?
Paul DeLucca.
Have you ever heard of him?
Paul DeLucca?
No, but then I wouldn' t.
He' s really well- known.
He' s a genius.
I' m sure.
He says he thinks I' m going to make it big.
I know you will.
Maybe you' ve seen some of my movies.
It' s possible.
Did you ever see The Enchanted Pussy?
But I...
I... it' s on my list.
They' re videotaped, so you could rent it.
But my real ambition is to be on Broadway in a musical.
- I sing.
- Do you?
Excuse me.
Hello.
Is he?
Some of them are called John, all right?
Was that your husband?
Ha ha.
Very funny.
Anything like that?
'Cause some do.
You have a funny look on your face.
Did I say the wrong thing?
No, not really.
- I said...
- No!
No!
Listen, what are you in the mood for?
Me?
I would like... we could chat for a while.
I thought I' d get into it slowly, and, you know...
You' re married, aren' t you.
How can you tell that?
'Cause you got that look.
That look?
What look is that?
That look like it' s been a long time since you had a great blowjob.
Oh, that look.
I can understand...
Where are you from?
Around.
What are you so interested in me for?
That' s my fingers.
Yes, I know.
Here.
Pull!
- Pull the string.
- Pull these strings?
- Pull all the strings.
- See what happens?
- I' m not so mechanical...
It' s easy.
Pull.
See?
It opens.
Science is...
Oh, really.
You' re a very attractive woman... a very beautiful young woman.
Thank you, honey.
You' re cute, too.
So what do you say?
You want to go inside?
Take a shower?
You can study me up close and personal.
Oh, no.
See, I' ve bathed already.
You got lipstick on my fi...
You smell clean.
As I say, I' m basically...
- My ear.
- You' re sensitive, huh?
That' s my weak spot, in my ear.
Just makes me...
Okay, Lenny.
Are you nervous.
But, yes, I am nervous, to tell you the truth.
I' ve never done this, actually.
That' s all right.
I' il take it slow.
Oh, okay.
I get $200.
That' s no problem.
- I just...
- Thanks, Lenny.
Just a show of good faith.
Put it down as a religious contribution.
No, but seriously, you want to know why I liked you right from the start?
- Why?
'Cause I' m always attracted to losers.
Losers?
You think I' m a loser?
Yeah.
You got no confidence.
It' s sweet.
I like that in a man.
I can' t stand those johns who' ve come in here and throw down a couple hundred and whip out a big dick and wave it all over the joint.
I wouldn' t do that even if I wanted to.
Shit!
Hello.
Oh, hello, Angela.
Oh, God.
Thank you for thinking of me.
That' s great.
Okay, yeah...
Well, I' il see you at ten.
Bye.
I just got a small part in an Angela Dawson movie.
I get to do it with her.
I don' t understand you.
If you' re serious about being a Broadway actress, what are you wasting your time with all this porn for?
What' s it to you?
It' s good experience.
Making it with a woman in front of the camera is good experience?
That' s going to get you closer to be a Broadway star?
- What are you getting all mad for?
- I' m not mad.
I just think it' s crazy.
You' re an attractive young woman.
You don' t have to live like this.
You take money from guys, and you perform all these acts.
You could be... hey!
I' m talking to you.
- You could have a family.
- Let go of me.
You could have a husband and a child....
Stop!
Stop it now!
Now listen, I don' t like possessive men.
You don' t want to do anything with me...
- I want to talk.
- Do you want to do it or not?
I paid you, I want to talk.
- I bought the time.
- You get your money back.
- Keep the money.
- Refund.
Let' s go.
I bought the time.
Stop it.
I' m giving it back and you' re leaving.
- Why can' t I talk?
- Get out!
Daddy, why are you staring at me like that?
Come here.
You know why I' m staring at you?
Because you' re so bright, and you' re such a great kid...
Come on, Max.
It' s time for bed.
Come on.
Time for beddums.
Kid' s gettin 'heavy.
He can walk, you know.
Can you walk?
Poor Weinrib.
Turn back!
Don' t meddle any further.
Accept the truth.
I see disaster.
I see catastrophe.
Worse!
I see lawyers.
But wait!
A messenger.
I come from the midtown area, where Lenny Weinrib tortured by passions too overwhelming to regulate, did indeed call this little hustler on the phone in earnest attempt to see her again.
At first, he wrestled with these drives, trying to master a curiosity not slaked by this initial meeting, but only whetted by it.
His thirst to know this woman more did inexorably provoke him to call her.
Then, at fifth try, she picked up the phone herself.
"Stop bothering me, creep!" was her cutting declaration.
Then she used the "F" word.
Agonized, he called again, offering her abundant financial compensation just for a brief chat.
But she bade him get off her back and slammed the phone down.
Finally, in doldrums mixed with much anxiety, he stood watch outside her apartment, and waited until such a time as he did spot her heading for the laundromat.
- Oh, my God.
- Don' t get upset or anything.
I thought we could have lunch.
I' il pay for your time.
- I just want to speak to you.
- All right!
What are you?
Some kind of fucking pervert...
Leave me alone.
I' m not one of those psychopaths that kills prostitutes.
I promise you.
- Why would you say that.
I' m joking.
ln my work, I have to keep an eye out for strange individuals.
I knew a girl that got killed.
I got you some flowers.
Let' s have lunch.
I' il pay for it.
I' il pay for your time.
I just want to talk to you.
So then my mother married my third father...
I don' t know if she married him, but he moved in.
We didn' t get along.
He was a disgusting drunk.
What about your hereditary father?
Your actual, actual...
Oh!
He was a drug pusher.
And, you know, he burgled and stuff, and he was an epileptic.
You haven' t left anything out, right?
- Mail fraud!
- Mail fraud.
That' s what they caught him on.
Hey, you got an appetite like a lumberjack here.
Oh, well, thank you.
It' s fine.
Eat all you want.
I' m very hungry, actually.
And I went away with this musician named Johnny.
It was terrible, because we fought all the time.
Finally, he committed suicide.
He always hated my clam sauce.
And so then I kicked around from Chicago, Philadelphia..... all over the place, and I ended up here.
You never thought of just getting a regular job?
Well, yeah, sure I did.
I did things.
I did phone sex.
Now and then I would turn a few tricks to make some dough, and one day my friend Suzie calls me and asks me if I want to be in a film, something called Snatch Happy.
I said sure, and I remember I was very nervous because I' d never done it in front of people with a camera before.
So there I am on the first day, on the set, and there' s this guy fucking me from behind, right?
And there' s these two huge guys dressed like cops in my mouth at the same time, and I remember thinking to myself,
I want to study.
Yes, well, it' s... it' s one way of getting into the profession.
Tell me about your family a little bit.
I told you already.
You could write a book by now.
But were there any unusual members?
Very bright ones, brilliant, talented...
Yes, I' m sorry.
My father' s brother was supposed to be a genius.
I never met him, but everybody said he was brilliant.
Really?
What did he do?
He spent his whole life in jail.
But if he had gone straight, he might have been very good in math.
I think I got my intelligence from him, because everybody else in the family is all slugs and lowlifes.
- I' m the only one with any ambition.
- Are you?
And you never had a drive to get married?
What for?
They were all assholes.
One of them used to beat me up.
Another one used to fuck my best friend when I wasn' t looking.
It was sickening.
And let me ask you this.
At any point in your life did you ever think, like... maybe I' d like to have a child?
- I did have a child once.
- Did you?
It was a sad story.
I' il tell you some other time when I know you better.
If I ever know you better.
Are you free this afternoon?
Do you have some free time this afternoon?
Are you finally in the mood?
I have an assignment.
I thought you might want to come with me because I think you' il enjoy it.
I' m going to bet on a horse, and if it wins, you can keep the dough.
Here' s one.
Eager Beaver.
I once did a film called Beaver Patrol about these boy scouts who find drunk girl scouts in the woods.
They take them to a cabin and pull out these dildos...
All right, okay.
You' re sure you want to bet on Eager Beaver?
- I know it' s the one.
- It' s 60- 1.
It' s a sign.
I know it' s going to work.
Famous last words.
I got a hunch.
You got a hunch.
We' il bet on it.
So if he wins, how much do I make?
At 60- 1 you make three thousand dollars.
Oh, my God.
I could get that blue chinchilla coat I wanted.
You could get anything you wanted.
- A jacuzzi...
- Except he' s not gonna win.
I know what I could do!
This is great.
I hope you' re right.
There' s a reason the horse is 60- 1, though.
He' s probably got polio.
This is a sign.
My luck is going to change.
Is your real name Linda?
I use a lot of names.
My born name is Leslie, but I like to use names that have nice meanings, like Mary... for the Virgin Mary, or angel, or Linda, which means pretty in Spanish.
But my screen name' s Judy Cum.
Lucky there' s not a horse with that name...
No, no, no.
My attorney friend would take that under advisement.
I got exclusive rights to that name.
All right, all right.
Let me ask you a question.
Are you ever frightened that when a guy comes over to your house and pays you that he' s going to tie you up and kill you?
I always get paid in advance.
Come on.
Eager Beaver.
He' s paying.
Honey...
They' re coming to the finish.
It' s Autumn Daisy...
Eager Beaver continues to drop back.
Autumn Daisy...
It' s Autumn Daisy by a head.
Shit!
Last!
Damn it.
I had it spent already.
Relax, relax.
I mean, relax, will ya?
It' s not so terrible.
I told you it was a long shot.
Never!
I never win a fucking thing in my entire life.
Stay calm.
You gotta learn to be a graceful loser.
If it' s the money, I' il lend you the money.
It' s not the money.
I don' t care about the money.
I just wanted to win so badly.
What do you want to win for?
We' re just out here having a good time.
Because I wanted to impress you.
Impress me?
You' re not running in the race.
You don' t have to impress me.
But I wanted to show you I could pick a winner.
My horse didn' t win either.
You do impress me.
You' re attractive.
You' re quick.
You' re obviously a state- of- the- art philatrix.
- What?
- Nothing.
I' m impressed.
Don' t say "nothing."
You think I' m stupid?
I don' t think you' re stupid.
I think you' re doing a stupid thing with your life, but I told you that already.
I don' t understand why it matters so much to you.
We' il stay for one more race, and this time I' il bet for you.
Let me make the bet.
Let' s go to the window.
We' il make one bet.
'cause I want a winner.
They give these horses saliva tests.
I gave you your winnings, right?
Yeah.
That was a great race.
Too bad the horse only paid 40 cents.
At least you get something.
Yeah.
So, you want to come in?
I gotta go home.
I got a wife and kid.
You never talk about yourself.
I had a great time, but I gotta go.
I feel I owe you a great fuck.
Do me a favour.
Stay in tonight.
I can' t stay in.
I got six dates.
Slow night for you.
I' d be wealthy.
So you gonna call me again?
Don' t worry.
Promise?
I' il call you again.
Okay.
I had a great time.
Bye.
- Congratulations.
- Thirty- five years.
You and Amanda have a way to go, but you' il make it.
You guys look so young, both of you.
Your mother could be your sister, and you could be brother and...
I don' t know where that puts me, but anyway...
She looks so beautiful, doesn' t she?
To me she always looks beautiful.
And you, when I said sisters before, I mean it.
You guys look so great.
With all the responsibility she has opening her new gallery...
What new gallery?
New gallery?
I didn' t tell you, 'cause I don' t know until...
Did I say the wrong thing?
I' m just not sure.
- It' s 100 percent definite.
You' re so insecure.
Excuse me.
What is the story?
It looks like I have the backing, but it' s not definite.
Your mother said it was definite.
Seems I do have the backing, and there' s this wonderful space on Vesey street.
And it looks like... we think we can get it.
The Dorans are putting in some money.
- Don' t look so happy about it.
But it' s the first I' m hearing of it.
And if your mother didn' t tell me...
I know that' s a sore point, but it will be only till it gets off the ground.
- I' m happy for you.
- You are?
Yes.
I just would have liked to have known.
- The Amanda Sloan gallery.
- On Vesey Street.
Believe me, I haven' t even told Jerry Bender yet.
You' ve got a fine right, you have, after the way you treated mother, after the way you treated us all.
A fine right you' ve got to come back in here in your best country manner and strike attitudes and make stands and criticise my fiancé, and give orders, and mess things up generally as if you' ve done...
It' s sickening.
As if he' d done nothing at all!
Well?
What do you think?
About what?
About me.
You think I' m any good?
Yes, it' s fine.
I don' t know that much about acting, to tell you the truth.
I can tell you' re not too impressed.
I just thought it' s a very odd part for you to choose.
Why?
- Because it' s the Philadelphia Story.
- I lived in Philadelphia.
- What has that got to do with it?
- I know the city.
Who care...?
You pick a part like this.
You should get something closer to yourself.
It wouldn' t be such a struggle.
What part should I play?
I don' t know.
Something closer.
Clint Eastwood doesn' t play a meek little hairdresser.
I could play a hairdresser.
I wanted to be one.
I was very good at it.
Why' d you give it up?
One thing led to another.
She loved it.
Wait.
You mean not be an actress.
An actress is a very tough life.
But a hairdresser can always make a buck.
- A buck?
- An honest buck.
No AlDS.
You can meet somebody... get a family.
Someone that cares for you.
Hey!
Now don' t you think that I want to meet somebody and get married and get the hell out of the rat race?
I don' t want to be a hairdresser.
If Clint Eastwood wants to, let him.
You miss the point.
Clint Eastwood doesn' t want to be a hairdresser.
I had a kid, Lenny.
And I gave him up for adoption.
It' s the sorriest thing I ever did in my entire life.
There' s not a day that doesn' t go by that I don' t wake up thinking about him.
I just hope to God that they' re taking good care of him.
Why' d you give him up?
I was all confused.
I didn' t know what to do.
I didn' t even know who the father was.
It could have been any one of a hundred guys.
Welcome to planet Earth thanks to a broken condom.
That' s tough.
What about your kid?
Max?
You know, Max is the greatest.
- Yeah?
- Sure.
Do you have a picture of him?
A picture of Max?
I' d like to see him.
Yeah, I guess I...
He' s very sweet.
You' re very lucky.
With Amanda, it was fate.
With Linda, it' s hubris.
His drive to find out, and now, to change her life, to control her.
- Yes.
- Danger.
Wait.
I see danger.
Wait a minute.
I don' t have any interest in controlling her.
I' m doing this for Max' s sake.
And I' d be happier if she was married and a hairdresser rather than the star of The Enchanted Pussy.
Danger.
I see horrible, horrible danger.
Terrible danger.
I can handle myself emotionally.
Physical danger.
I see a bald man.
He' s breaking your knee caps.
So how did Jerry Bender take it when you said that the decision was final?
You know what?
He was amazing.
I thought he' d be upset, but he was very excited and very supportive.
He was absolutely great about it.
Anyway, I' m calling to say I can' t make dinner tonight.
You' re kidding.
It' s going to be great.
Everybody in the Madison Square Garden organisation is going to be there.
There' s no way I can get away.
The architects are here and the Dorans are in town from Paris.
And the architects fly back to Milan tonight.
I can' t.
I' il spend a little time there.
I' m going to call you back.
I' m going to call you back.
- It' s just against our policy.
- I understand.
- If you want to wait here.
- Whatever.
There' s someone here to see you.
Come in.
Come in.
This is Miss Gildersleeve.
You know her?
Miss Gildersleeve.
It' s okay.
I' il be in here.
- You don' t need anything?
- I' m fine.
What are you doing here?
Lenny, I gotta talk to you.
Ricky threatened to hurt me.
Who' s Ricky?
He takes a percentage of my work.
He' s a pimp, right?
No, he' s like a business representative.
What do you need a business rep...
All you need is a mattress and a couple of garter belts.
You' re not a conglomerate.
He said he was going to cut me up because I told him I didn' t want to work anymore.
It' s a great idea that you want to phase out.
He has no qualms about killing me.
Call the police.
That' s not a big deal.
How can I call the police with my set- up?
You know, I told you a thousand times you' re in a hazardous business.
- I' m sorry.
- Don' t go outside.
- I' m not going outside.
I thought maybe if you could talk to him.
Me?
What are you, nuts?
Because you' re smart and bright and you got a way with words.
I can' t talk to him.
I don' t even know the guy.
He knows it was your idea that I get out of the business, so he said he' s going to kill you too.
He said he was going to kill me?
'Cause it was your idea, he' s going to cut up my face and put a bullet between your eyes.
Really?
Did he specify the calibre?
I just thought maybe you could reason with him.
No, I can' t.
I never told you this, but I got a slight heart murmur, and right now it' s murmuring, "Hide".
I don' t believe you' re a coward.
Only in actuality.
This is not for me.
- I need your help.
- I' m not a violent person.
I write about hockey, and boxing and football.
- This is not my world.
- I want to quit, like you said.
He' s going to hurt us both.
What do you want me to do?
How am I going to talk to him?
You just talk, because you' re smarter than he is, and you' re stronger than he is.
You' re a much better man.
He' s a little intimidating.
But you' il win.
I know you will.
I don' t...
You' re a good man.
You' il win.
In case anything comes up,
Okay?
Did you get caught up....
Excuse me.
I' m a friend of Linda Ash' s.
What I want to discuss with you is that... there comes a time in the life of every young woman, not just Linda, but everyone, that they want to perhaps make a change in their life.
They maybe want to settle down, or explore alternative lifestyles.
I don' t think you' ve been a very good influence on Linda, Mr. Weinrib.
Weinrib.
Right.
Gildersleeve is a name that I use for business purposes.
I got an investment in Linda.
No question.
I honour that.
But by now she' s probably repaid you ten- fold or twenty- fold...
Don' t be so fuckin 'sure,' cause you don' t know what the fuckin 'numbers are.
Excuse me, you' re...
Is that a Peligrino?
Can I...
Because you' ve bent my throat now.
The windpipe used to hang straight.
Fucking Knicks suck.
They need a good shooting forward.
There' s going to be a three- way trade.
Seattle, Atlanta, and the Knicks are talking.
Bullshit.
I know.
It' s in the air.
They' re discussing a trade.
You think the Nets got a chance?
If they' re injury free, I think they have a good chance.
I like the Nets.
They' re two years away is all.
I would say two or three, myself.
We have a common interest, the three of us.
- What were we talking about?
- Linda Ash.
Oh, yeah.
That girl' s goin 'no place.
She walks on me I' il disfigure her and I' il fuckin 'kill you.
That' s exactly what Dr. Kleinholdtz would call acting out.
Don' t tell me how to run my business.
My girls do what I tell them.
That' s why you can afford an establishment like this.
You' re going to take that from him?
Take it easy.
I' m about to have an out of body experience here.
Show strength.
Show strength?
This guy is going to put me into 27 separate Mason jars.
They despise cowardice.
Power is all they know.
Stand firm.
Remember brave Achilles.
Achilles only had an Achilles heel.
Go on.
Look, I' il level with you.
I want to discuss this Linda Ash thing...
What are you so interested in Linda for anyway?
Are you fuckin 'her?
It' s a strictly Platonic relationship.
She' s liable to get hurt.
You too.
You going to let him do that to you?
Would you do me a favour and go back to Athens?
You going to let your son' s mother remain a white slave to this two- bit pimp?
It' s starting to look that way.
- Get the Knicks tickets yet?
- No tickets.
I tried everywhere.
Do you need tickets to the Knicks game?
Why?
Who do you know?
We want seats on the floor, next to the movie stars.
If you want to discuss a deal with Linda I can get you courtside seats.
Nobody can get 'em.
I tried.
I can.
I' m a sportswriter.
I can get 'em.
I' d fucking give you my mother for courtside seats, much less this cheap little whore.
Succinctly put.
I know what point you' re making.
I will shoot you and her through the fuckin 'eyeballs.
Silly to haggle over details.
I' il get the tickets.
I promise.
Then we can discuss Linda.
Are you very brave?
Am I brave?
Funny you should ask that question.
Who' d win a fight, you versus Mike Tyson?
What?
Who' d win what?
Who' d win a fight, you versus Mike Tyson?
Me versus Mike Tyson?
Who do you think would win?
You?
It' d be no contest.
He would probably take the early rounds, but I' d get to him.
I' d chase him all over the ring.
That' s my style.
Always was.
I think it will work.
I think it will.
I want the gallery to be lit from above so I guess the skylight will have to be enlarged.
Could you?
- Me or him?
- Him.
Please?
I can' t.
Why are you fighting this?
And I love Lenny.
I love him.
Who are you trying to convince?
I got you a present.
You' re kidding.
Yeah, for fixing things up with me and Ricky.
I know that he can be really rough.
That was completely unnecessary.
Very sweet, but completely unnecessary.
You didn' t want a blowjob, so the least I could do was get you a tie.
Good thinking.
That' s, uh... a tie, isn' t it?
Would you ever wear anything that bright?
If the occasion demanded.
If I ever get invited to the Mardi Gras.
Oh, good.
Do you want a sandwich?
No, I' m fine.
Thank you.
- It' s great.
- Good.
You know what, Lenny?
I couldn' t get your son' s picture out of my mind.
He' s a very cute kid.
Yeah.
Len, I think I would be a good mother.
I think you' d be a great mother.
You' re very affectionate.
I would like to start over again.
Maybe have a house.
- That would be nice.
- It would be great.
I think it would be fabulous.
And you could do it.
Yeah?
The problem is now finding the right guy.
Somebody who will take care of me, and respect me.
I' il keep my eye open.
Maybe, who knows?
The only thing is he' d have to be as smart as me.
I' m sure there' s somebody out there...
You' il find an equal somewhere.
And don' t worry, Len.
I gave up on you.
I knew it couldn' t be.
Let me tell you, at my age, if I made love with you, they would have to put me on a resuscitator.
My kid.
How old are you?
- Five.
- You' re five?
You going to be a fighter?
Max is going to be a middleweight.
I think he' s going to be a heavyweight the way you' re carrying him.
I' m going to teach you how to box, Max.
I' m going to show you a combination punch.
Two, three and four you' re going to get.
This is my kid, Max.
This is Ray.
Max is going to be a middleweight when he gets older.
Maybe a heavyweight?
Looks like a heavyweight.
- You going to hit the bag with me?
- Okay.
- Nice kid.
- He' s a doll.
So what' s with the Sanchez thing?
Is he going to win that?
Is he training?
He can do it.
He' s in the best shape of his life.
Only thing is you don' t know what these guys do outside the gym.
You hear the stories.
He' il be all right.
Kevin, come here.
I want to introduce you to my friend.
He' s a sportswriter.
How ya doin '?
I' m going to get warmed up, all right?
- Show us what you can do.
- My hand' s still sore.
You' il be okay.
I don' t know the kid.
This kid can move.
He hits good, too.
Nice hand speed, you know?
Only thing is you don' t know about these guys.
Sometimes they lack the desire.
I don' t know if he' s got the killer instinct.
Keeps talking about going upstate where he comes from, on an onion farm.
He wants to be an onion farmer.
- The kid' s a farmer?
- An onion farmer.
I don' t know how long he' s going to stick around.
It' s a shame, too.
He' s fast.
But he wants to quit boxing.
He wants to hang out on the farm.
And the worst thing of all is his girlfriend left him.
- She quit on him.
- Really?
Took him for everything he' s got.
He' s a nice, sweet kid, but between you and I, ain' t got much upstairs.
They' re all alike.
What' s the matter with you?
Looks like you got something on your mind.
Hey, this is the left, and this is the right, right?
Yeah, yeah, Kevin.
That' s right.
- Hi, Lenny.
I' m so sorry I' m late.
It' s startin 'to rain.
I don' t have an umbrella.
I met a guy this afternoon that I think would be great for you.
- Perfect.
- For me?
He' s healthy.
Absolutely perfect.
What does he do?
He' s dicking around in agriculture.
What' s wrong with his dick?
He' s a farmer.
The guy' s a farmer.
- You met a farmer?
- An onion farmer.
- Where?
- At the gym.
What the hell is an onion farmer doing at the gym?
He' s finishing a very productive career as a boxer.
A boxer?
Lenny.
He doesn' t want to be a boxer anymore.
He wants to meet the right girl and be a farmer.
Don' t look at me.
His brother has a big onion farm upstate, and just think of it.
A small town, and you' re hairdressing, and raising kids.
What small town?
- Wompsville.
- Where?
It' s an old lndian name.
It' s a place rich in American heritage.
Are you off your fucking rocker?
I' m going to marry an onion farmer and do hair in Wimpsville?
Wompsville, not Wimpsville.
It' s so perfect.
He' s great.
Forget it.
He' s perfect, though.
You' il think he' s bright.
He' s a fucking onion farmer.
He' s a nice kid.
More important, he' s honest, and decent, and don' t offer to give him a blowjob in the first five minutes.
- He thinks you' re a hairdresser.
- You lied?
- You shouldn' t lie.
- Just do what I' m telling you.
Just listen to me for once.
I' m off the girls.
The last girl I was with cheated me out of all my dough.
This is a nice kid.
She' s nice.
This the hairdresser you told me about?
This girl could have her pick of any guy she wants.
What' d you tell her?
I told her you were handsome, a great athlete, you' re gifted, bright...
You didn' t lie.
Would I lie?
Of course not.
You told her I could fight?
I told her, but what touches her heart is that you want to be a farmer.
This is a girl that has a love of the soil.
I promise you.
Onions.
My brother' s got an onion farm.
I want to go there and get the hell out of the city.
Perfect.
She goes nuts if you say onion.
You say onion to Linda, the girl...
All right, all right.
That' s her name?
Linda?
Linda, yeah.
It' s a pretty name.
What are you so standoffish...
- Is that with a "er" or "ur"?
- Is what with an...
- Linder.
- Linda.
With an "a".
She' s a great kid, and she' s a substantial woman.
This is not a dumb girl.
This girl has got a PhD in root and follicle culture.
She' s pretty, right?
She' s to die.
That' s important, 'cause I been stung.
The last girl I was with drove me up the wall.
She made my stomach sick to the stomach.
Linda is church people.
That' s what I want.
I want a church girl.
I don' t want one of these fast New York sluts.
I want a nice homely girl that likes to raise a family, dogs and all that kind of thing.
Can I say two words to you?
Butter churn.
Butter churn.
This is a pioneer girl.
This is a girl who is practically incidentally a virgin.
What do you mean, practically?
An old college professor and her childhood sweetheart.
Both of them killed in combat for their nation.
- It' s a sad story.
- A professor got killed in combat?
Humanities regiment.
They were the first ones to land in Anzio.
And you said she was an actress.
She' s been in some films?
She' s had a couple of good roles.
Like what?
She' s ever been in anything I' ve seen?
You didn' t see Schindler' s List?
That was the one with the Jews and... who were the bad guys?
The Nazis.
The blond guys were the Nazis.
They were tough motherfuckers.
I' m telling you, this is a good girl.
She' s wonderful.
He' s playing God.
It would be nice if he could bring this off.
It' s hubris.
He spent a lot of time preparing her.
Listen, have you given any more thought to what we discussed?
I did.
I mean, look, the problem is I don' t know how I feel anymore.
I' m confused.
- Listen, Amanda, I love you.
- Yeah?
And you' re never going to be able to forgive yourself if you don' t give it a try.
Kevin, this is Linda.
Linda, this is Kevin.
- How ya doin '?
- Hi.
I' il go.
I just wanted to bring you guys together.
You know, you could maybe stick around.
I' m completely superfluous.
You don' t feel good?
No, I' m superfluous.
I' m completely unnecessary.
You guys can have a great time and I got stuff to do.
I got these for you.
What are these, daisies?
That' s nice.
- Yeah.
- I thought you said he was a farmer.
He is a farmer.
They' re not onions.
Daisies make me sneeze.
Come here a minute.
Excuse us one second.
They' re beautiful flowers.
Tell him they' re beautiful and enjoy yourself.
- They make me sneeze.
- I' il hold them.
She sneezes from flowers.
That' s good luck.
- I' il hold the flowers.
- Thanks.
Go ahead, have fun.
I' il see you guys.
Take care.
So... you' re pretty.
You' re really pretty.
Thanks.
You' re not so bad yourself.
Yeah, I know.
I bet you' re hung like a horse.
Yeah, I could ride a horse.
I like animals.
He' s got a farm up there with the ducks and the pigs...
Oh, yeah. ln Wisconsin.
Wompsville.
- We' il go to the zoo, huh?
- Okay.
.. Something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me why should it be
You have the pow' r to hypnotize me
Live 'neath your spell
Do do that voodoo that you do so well
For you do something to me
That nobody else can do
I had 16 fights and I won them all but 12.
I' m impressed.
How long were you doin 'hair?
I' m just getting started now.
That' s right, 'cause you were doin' the acting, right?
- Yeah.
- That' s right.
I didn' t get to see Schindler' s List.
Me, neither.
What were some of the other films you were in?
Salad.
The Enchanted Salad?
What was that about?
Was it good.
Yeah, it was really good.
It was about a waitress.
I had a really good time with you tonight.
- Did you?
- Yeah.
Me too.
You' re really good at arcade games.
I used to date a pinball champ, not for nothing.
Pinball champ?
Was it like a serious relationship?
We were getting engaged but then two guys strangled him.
- You know what I like in a woman?
- What?
I like, like an old- fashioned girl, you know, like my mom.
Like a girl who likes to take care of the house, cook and clean, and doesn' t mind, you know, walking the dogs, doin 'the lawn and that kind of thing.
You know what I mean?
That' s like my mom.
Yeah.
What do you like in a man?
I like a guy who has a good job who treats me nice, and, well, who' s kind of built like you.
Doesn' t have to stuff a sock in his jock to look good.
- You know what my dream is?
- What?
I' m in a field, right?
And, like, this hawk comes, and picks me up in his beak, right?
So I see everything?
And then like he flies me out of the country, and like we got up to the North Pole and he drops me in the snow.
I' m just layin 'there naked.
What' s your dream?
My dream is that somebody would come along and think that I was special.
That, you know, they want to come and change my life for me.
That' s my dream.
You could have that.
You think?
Yeah, I think.
You could definitely have that.
Pretty girl like you.
So you think I' m going to get to see you again, or what?
Do you want to?
A lot.
I want to a lot.
Me, too.
True love, as refreshing as spring.
They kissed goodnight.
And saw each other the very next night, and the next.
Hold it, everybody.
Something' s coming in.
A bulletin.
Uh- oh.
Here comes Miss Party- pooper.
I have a vision of him and Weinrib.
Where?
The Acropolis.
Weinrib.
I saw your wife, Amanda.
You know me?
I saw her.
She was working late at the gallery.
And with her was this Jerry Bender guy.
That' s nothin '.
She works with Jerry Bender.
Nothin 'unusual.
- You didn' t let me finish.
- Go on.
They spoke in intimate tones, and then Bender rose and laid a big wet one on her.
Big wet...
Bender kissed Amanda?
That' s what I' m tellin 'ya.
You must have known something was going on.
I always thought that Bender had eyes for her.
Now he' s got eyes and hands.
Amanda didn' t respond, did she?
She just opened her mouth very wide and stuck her tongue out as far as humanly possible.
Are you sure?
Hey, did the Trojan horse have a wooden dick?
And then she pushed her abdomen against his.
I got the picture.
I always suspected.
Something you don' t want to know, but you had to be blind not to see it.
I' m gonna confront her.
Not in front of Max.
Max has got a sleepover date at his friend' s house.
Down deep I knew it.
Thanks, Weinrib.
Thanks.
Thank you.
God bless you.
Oh my God.
It' s more serious than we thought.
It' s very serious.
Her marriage to Lenny is in crisis.
With the passage of time, even the strongest bonds become fragile.
Great, fellas.
It sounds like a fortune cookie.
Oh, Zeus, most potent of gods, we implore thee, we need your help.
Zeus, great Zeus, hear us.
We call out to thee.
Um, this is Zeus.
I' m not home right now, but you can leave a message and I' ilget back to you.
Please start speaking at the tone.
We need help.
God, I think I should move out.
I can' t understand this.
It' s so radical.
No, 'cause I can' t cheat.
Jerry Bender' s in love with me.
And what do you tell me?
That you' re in love with him?
I don' t know.
I gotta find out.
What do you mean you don' t know?
- I don' t know.
- What do you mean you don' t know?
Are you in love with him or not?
Face it, things have changed between us.
We can fix things.
And what about Max?
He' il be okay.
Maybe it will be better for him with us apart instead of together and arguing all the time.
That' s crazy.
I just think that' s crazy.
It' s just too crazy.
Where are you going?
I' m going out.
I have to get my thoughts together.
I been waitin 'for you, man.
Leave me alone.
I' m in a very bad mood.
How could you do this to me?
How could you set me up with this stupid girl?
What are you talking about?
You didn' t tell me she was a hooker, and did porno films and had sex with hundreds and hundreds of men and women and who knows what else.
- I thought it would prejudice you.
- What?
How did you find out?
I look up on the screen and this actress is up there, Judy Cum.
I told you she had dramatic aspirations.
I flew off the handle.
I thought you were broad- minded.
I came over here and she confessed to everything.
- And I hit her.
- You hit her?
I was going to break your neck.
- I don' t believe this.
- I don' t believe this.
- You hit her?
- A little bit.
God.
I called my mother.
She says I should come home.
I don' t understand you.
You' re a broadminded guy.
People change.
You going to hold her past against her?
- She' s a porn star!
- You love her.
She loves you.
It' s over, man.
I told you from day one the girl was not a virgin.
You didn' t tell me how many times, though.
Thanks for nothin ', Lenny.
Nah, man.
He hit me.
I know.
I ran into him downstairs and he...
Look at you.
Does it feel terrible?
Just my ulcer.
Your ulcer.
You shouldn' t be drinking.
That' s the worst...
Oh, God, look at that.
Remember you once said we were a couple of losers?
- Yeah.
- I think that' s definitely true.
What happened to you?
Amanda left me.
Oh, I' m sorry, Lenny.
- Would you like a drink?
- No.
What' s the matter?
I don' t know.
Was she great?
You can tell me.
Was she great in bed?
I mean, a woman with all that experience.
I don' t know.
I just know that suddenly I really miss Amanda.
But wait!
See who approaches.
There you are.
Where have you been?
I' ve been looking for you all over.
I was just out drinking and thinking about everything.
Oh, Lenny, I' m sorry.
I was up all night thinking how much I hurt you, and how much I messed us up for good.
I love you.
I don' t love Jerry at all.
We have to put things right.
Whatever has to be done.
When you' re alone the magic moonlight dies
At break ofdawn there is no sunrise
And as for Linda, she drove upstate to Wompsville and pleaded with Kevin to take her back, but to no avail.
Anyway, on the way home she was distraught, and felt life held no hope, when, talk about a deus ex machina...
Like faded flowers life can' t mean anything
When your lover has gone
So we just had a stabilizing problem and the thing got off balance and the radio went glitchy, so I needed to get down to use a phone.
Thank you very much, by the way, for stopping.
My name' s Don.
And so Linda married.
And to a wonderful man who was not uptight and repressed and accepted her, and even laughed at wild tales of her promiscuous background.
And so our little Greek drama comes...
Wait, wait.
There' s more.
What more, Tiresias, blind seer of Thebes.
Tell them just to call me Tiresias, will ya?
The handicapped are always cranky.
like he was Zeus and she was Aphrodite with an aphrodisiac.
Get to the point.
The point is Linda did that night conceive a child.
She never told him.
lnstead she went off with her new husband who stood behind her loyally as she gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.
Lenny never saw Linda again, and then, one fall day in New York...
I think they' re probably in the back there.
We can look through the whole store if you like...
I don' t believe this.
What are you doing here?
I' m stunned.
What happened to you?
I' m married, and my husband Don is a helicopter pilot.
You' re kidding?
Where did you go?
It' s like you vanished off the face of the earth.
We had our moment, but I knew you would be back with Amanda.
I can' t...
That' s so great.
So you' re married, and this is yours?
Yes!
Look at her.
She' s adorable.
Very, very...
- This is Max.
- Is that Max?
This is a friend.
- Hi, I' m Linda.
- How do you do?
What a handsome boy.
Amanda must be very beautiful.
She has a great face.
I' m stunned.
I don' t know what to say.
Lenny, it' s so great to see you.
You' re okay, everything?
I' m really good.
Thank you for everything.
I' m going to be late.
- It was great to see you.
- It was great to see you.
Great.
And they don' t know.
Yes, yes. lsn' t life ironic?
Life is unbelievable... miraculous, sad, wonderful.
Yes, this is all true.
And that' s why we say:
When you' re smiling
When you' re smiling
The whole world smiles with you
Keep smiling
When you' re laughing
When you' re laughing
The sun keeps shining through
But when you' re crying
You bring on the rain
So stop your sighing
Be happy again
Keep on smiling
'Cause when you' re smiling
The whole world smiles with you
When you' re smiling
When you' re smiling
The whole world smiles with you
When you' re laughing
When you' re laughing
The sun keeps shining through
But when you' re crying
You bring on the rain
So stop your sighing
Be happy again.
Keep on smiling
'Cause when you' re smiling
The whole world smiles with you
Choose life.
Choose a job.
Choose a career, a family.
Choose a fucking big TV.
Choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players.
Low cholesterol and dental insurance.
Choose mortgage repayments.
Choose a home.
Choose your friends!
Choose leisurewear and matching luggage.
Choose a three- piece suite on hire purchase!
Wondering who the fuck you are on a Sunday morning.
Stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth.
'Choose rotting away at the end,
'to the brats you' ve spawned.
'Choose your future.
'Choose life.'
But why would I want to do a thing like that?
I chose not to choose life.
And the reasons?
There are no reasons.
Who needs reasons when you' ve got heroin?
Goldfinger' s better than Dr No.
Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds Are Forever.
A judgement reflected in its relatively poor showing at the box office.
In which field, of course,
'People think it' s all about misery
'which is not to be ignored.'
Fuck off!
Jealous cunt!
'is the pleasure of it.'
White meat!
You prick!
'Otherwise, we wouldn' t do it.'
- You want me to do it?
Pure as driven snow, that shit.
'After all, we' re not fucking stupid.
'Or at least, we' re not that fucking stupid.'
'and you' re still nowhere near it.'
Oh, it beats any meat injection!
That beats any fucking cock in the world!
'When you' re on junk, you' ve only one worry - scoring.
'When you' re off it, you worry about all sorts of shite.
'No money, can' t get pissed.
'Can' t get a bird.
Got a bird, too much hassle.
'You worry about bills, food,
'some football team that never wins.
'when you have a sincere, truthful junk habit.'
I' d say in those days he was a muscular actor.
With all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster combined with a sly wit... to make him a formidable lead.
And closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
'The principal drawback is you have to endure cunts saying...'
No way would I poison my body with that shite.
All they fucking chemicals?
Poisoning your body with that shite.
Stuffing your veins with that filth!
'From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.'
Never again, Swanney.
I' m off the skag.
Are you serious?
- No more.
- It' s up to you.
I want off it for good.
- I' ve heard it before.
- The Sick Boy method.
- It really worked for him.
- Well, he lacks moral fibre.
- He' s a Sean Connery expert.
- That' s hardly a substitute.
- You' il need one more hit.
For the long night ahead.
'Of course I' d have another shot.
Relinquishing junk, stage one - preparation.
For this you will need: a room which you won' t leave, soothing music.
Tomato soup, ten tins of; mushroom soup, eight tins of - for consumption cold.
Ice- cream - vanilla, one large tub of.
Magnesia, Milk of - one bottle.
Paracetamol, mouthwash, vitamins,
Lucozade, pornography.
One mattress.
Buckets for urine, faeces and vomitus.
One television and one bottle of valium procured from my mother who is, in her own domestic and socially acceptable way, also a drug addict.
Now I' m ready.
I just need one final hit to soothe the pain till the valium takes effect.
Yeah, it' s Mark Renton.
I wondered, could you help me out?
What the fuck are these?
'Normally, I have nothing to do with him
'but things were not normal.'
Opium suppositories!
Ideal for your purposes.
Bring you down gradually.
Custom fucking designed for your needs.
I want a fucking hit!
It' s all I' ve got, mate.
Take it or leave it.
Feelin 'better now?
I might as well have stuck them up my arse.
Heroin makes you constipated.
The heroin from my last hit is fading away and the suppositories have yet to melt.
I' m no longer constipated.
I fantasize about a massive, pristine convenience.
Brilliant gold taps, virginal white marble, a seat carved from ebony, a cistern full of Chanel No. 5, a flunky handing me pieces of silk toilet roll.
But under the circumstances,
Yes, ya fucking dancer!
Now I' m ready.
The downside of coming off junk was mixing with my friends again in a state of full consciousness.
They were so like me, I could hardly bear to look at them.
Sick Boy came off junk too, just to show me how easily he could do it.
When all I wanted to do was feel sorry for myself, he insisted on telling me his theory of life.
Certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
What d' you mean?
Well, at one point you' ve got it, then you lose it.
Then it' s gone forever.
All walks of life.
Georgie Best, for example, had it - lost it.
Or David Bowie or Lou Reed.
His solo stuff' s not bad.
But it' s not great either.
And in your heart you know that although it sounds all right, it' s actually just... shite.
So who else?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren,
- Elvis Presley...
What' s the point you' re making?
All I' m trying to do, Mark, is to help you understand that The Name Of The Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.
What about The Untouchables?
I don' t rate that at all.
Despite the Academy Award?
That means fuck all.
It' s a sympathy vote.
So we all get old, we cannae hack it any more and that' s it?
Yeah.
That' s your theory?
Yeah.
Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.
Have you got the beast in your sights?
This should present no significant problems.
For a vegetarian, Rents, you' re a fucking evil shot!
'Without heroin,
'I led a useful and fulfilling life as a good citizen.'
- Good luck, Spud.
- Cheers, Cat- boy.
If they think you' re no tryin ', you' re doomed.
They' il be on to the DSS and your giro' s fucking finished, right?
- But try too hard...
- You might get the job!
- Exactly.
- Nightmare!
- It' s a tightrope, Spud.
A fucking tightrope!
I get nerves, like footballers on big occasions.
Try some of this.
Some speed - just the ticket, man.
Naw, I went to Craigie - Craignewton.
I put Royal Edinburgh College to help get the job.
There' s too much discrimination here.
They' re both schools, right.
I put across the idea.
People get hung up on details.
Like how many O- grades I got.
Maybe six.
Maybe none.
What' s important is that I am.
Do you mean you lied on your application?
No... Well, yes.
To get my foot in the door.
Showing initiative.
You were referred by the Department of Employment.
Your foot was in the door.
Whatever you say, man.
You' re the man.
Obviously.
What exactly attracts you to the leisure industry?
In a word, pleasure.
Like, my pleasure in other people' s leisure.
Do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
I' m a bit of a perfectionist.
For me, it' s the best or nothin 'at all.
Things get dodgy - I cannot be bothered.
But I' m getting good vibes about this interview.
Seems to me it' s going pretty well, eh?
Thank you, Mr Murphy.
We' il let you know.
The pleasure was mine.
'Spud had done well.
'He made me proud.
Fucked up good and proper. '
Picture the scene.
The other fucking week there, down the Volley with Tommy playing pool.
I' m playing like Paul Newman, giving the boy a tanning.
It comes to the last shot, the deciding ball of the tournament.
I' m on the black, he looks biscuit- arsed.
When this hard cunt comes in.
Starts staring at me.
Looking right fucking at me as if to say, "Come ahead."
I' m not the type that goes looking for bother but I had a pool cue and he' d get it in his puss!
So I squares up, casual like.
What does the hard cunt do?
The so- called hard cunt?
Shites it!
Puts down his drink and gets the fuck out of there.
And after that... well, the game was mine.
'And that was it.
'Or Begbie' s version of the story.
'Later, I got the truth from Tommy.
'You always got the truth from Tommy.
'never cheated on anyone.'
It was Wednesday morning.
We were in the Volley, playing pool.
But Begbie is playing absolutely fucking gash.
His hangover' s so bad, he can hardly hold the fucking cue!
I' m doing my best to lose, trying to humour him.
But every time I touch a ball, I pot something.
Every time Begbie goes near the table, he fucks it up.
So, he' s got the hump.
But I set him up to pot the black, win one game, salvage his pride and not kick me in.
So, he' s on the black...
'Pressure shot...
'which goes wrong, big time.'
'He picks on this wee gadge,
'accusing him of putting him off.
'He hadn' t even glanced at us.'
- 'He' d have chibbed him.'
Then I thought he was gonna do me.
The beggar' s fucking psycho.
But he' s a mate.
- What can you do?
- Can I borrow this?
'What indeed could one do?
'Try not to get involved.'
'Begbie didn' t do drugs.
'He got off on it.
His own sensory addiction. '
Nobody move!
No cunt moves till we know who did it.
Yes!
'stolen only hours earlier from one of my best friends,
'I realised that something was missing from my life.'
How' s it going with Gail?
No joy yet.
How long is it?
Six weeks!
Nightmare right.
She told me she didn' t want our relationship to start out on a physical basis as that is how it principally is going to be defined from then on.
When did she come up with that?
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
Six weeks and no sex?
- I read it in Cosmopolitan.
Actually, it' s a nightmare.
I' m desperate for a shag but watching him suffer was just too much fun.
Try it wi 'Tommy.
It' s the only pleasure I get from him!
- You know about my birthday?
Useless motherfucker!
I said to her, look I' m sorry but these things happen, let' s put it behind us.
That' s fair enough.
Yes, but then she finds out I' ve got a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
Was she upset?
Very, "It' s me or Iggy Pop, time to decide."
What are you two talking about?
Football.
What are you talking about?
Shopping.
'The situation was becoming serious.
'as in all others, segregated themselves from the failures.'
'Heroin had robbed Renton of his sex drive
'but now it returned with a vengeance.
'and desperation took a hold on his sex- crazed mind.
'taunted him with his own unsatisfied desire.
'Mark Renton had fallen in love.'
Excuse me.
I don' t mean to harrass you but I was very impressed with the way you dealt with that situation.
- I think you' re special.
- Your name?
- Diane.
Where are you going?
- Home.
- Where' s that?
It' s where I live.
- Great.
- What?
I' il come back with you but I' m not promising anything.
Does this approach usually work?
Or have you never tried it before?
You don' t normally approach girls, right?
You' re a quiet, sensitive type but if I' m prepared to take a chance,
I' il get to know the inner you.
Witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal...
Taxi!
A little bit crazy, a little bit bad.
But hey, don' t us girls just love that (!)
Well?
Cat got your tongue?
I left something...
Are you getting in?
Do you understand?
You will be a considerate and thoughtful lover.
Generous... but firm.
Failure on your part to live up to these very reasonable expectations will result in swift resumption of a non- sex situation.
Right?
Shut up!
Wake up, Spud.
Wake up.
Sex!
Casual sex!
Tommy, put the tape on.
What?
I wanna watch ourselves while we' re screwing.
So let' s see what I' m missing.
Not much!
'The captain, Archie Gemmill,
'picking it up from the outside...
'He' s going all the way... and he scores!
'Oh, what a magnificent goal!
'Gemmill at his very best.
'What a penetrating goal that was.'
I haven' t felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
Right.
You can' t sleep here.
- Out!
Come on!
You can sleep on the hall sofa or go home.
And don' t make any noise.
Jesus!
Gone?
- Where has it gone?
- It' il be here somewhere!
I might' ve returned it by mistake.
Returned it?!
Where?
The video shop, Tommy?
The fucking video shop?!
So every punter in Edinburgh' s jerking off to our video?
Oh, God, Tommy, I feel sick!
- Hello.
Come in and sit down.
Like some coffee?
Aye.
You must be Mark.
Aye, that' s me.
Are you a friend of Diane' s?
- More a friend of a friend.
Are you her flatmates, like?
Flatmates?!
I must remember that one.
Morning.
Good morning, Spud.
Morning, Gail.
Mr Houston.
Mrs Houston.
Mornin ', Spud.
Sit down and have some breakfast.
I' m sorry about last night, by the way.
That' s OK.
I had a bit much to drink.
Had a bit of an accident.
Dinnae worry.
Does a man good to cut loose once in a while.
This one could do with being tied up.
I' il get the sheets washed.
I' il wash them.
No need.
- It' s no problem.
- Really...
- No!
- Spud, they' re my sheets!
- Why not?
- Because it' s illegal.
What, holding hands?
- No, not holding hands.
- to do a lot more last night.
- That' s what' s illegal!
Inside, they' d cut my balls off.
- You' re not going to jail.
- Easy for you to say.
- Can I see you again?
- Certainly not!
If you don' t see me again, I' il tell the police.
I' il see you around.
Now what?
We' re going for a walk.
A walk!
- Where?
- There!
Are you serious?
Well, what are you waitin 'for?
Tommy... this is not natural, man.
It' s the great outdoors!
Fresh air!
Don' t take it out on us.
Makes you proud to be Scottish.
It' s shite being Scottish!
The scum of the fuckin 'earth!
The most wretched, miserable, servile pathetic trash that was ever shat into civilisation!
Some hate the English.
I don' t - they' re just wankers.
We, on the other hand, are colonised by wankers.
Can' t even find a decent culture to be colonised by.
We' re ruled by effete arseholes!
It' s a shite state of affairs.
All the fresh air in the world won' t make a fucking difference!
Sorry, man.
It' s no 'like...
No, I appreciate it, Tommy.
'made a healthy, informed, democratic decision
'Took about twelve hours.'
'Looks easy, this.
'Looks like a doss, a soft option.
'But living like this is a full- time business.'
The quintessential Bond girl - that' s what everyone says.
The embodiment, right, of his superiority to us.
Beautiful... exotic... highly sexual yet... totally unavailable to anyone apart from him.
Let' s face it, she' d shag one punter from Edinburgh, she' d shag the whole fucking lot of us!
I knew he was gonna do that.
Lizzy' s gone, Mark.
She' s gone and fucking dumped me.
And that Iggy Pop business and other shite.
She told me where to go and no mistake.
I said to her,
"Is there any chance of getting back together?"
No fucking way.
Right?
What a total fucking misnomer!
I wouldnae touch her with yours!
I want to try it.
You' re always going on about how it' s the ultimate hit.
Better than sex.
Come on, man, I' m a fucking adult.
I can find out for myself.
I' ve got the money.
I mean, that' s what counts, right?
That' s what keeps a relationship going through the years.
Like heroin.
I mean, heroin' s got great fucking personality.
'It was the source of much of our gear.
'We stole prescriptions,
'old- aged pensioners, AlDS patients,
'cyclozine, codeine, temazepam,
'you can have for unhappiness and pain.
'We would' ve injected Vitamin C
May I use your bathroom?
Now Rent- boy, no fucking skag.
'But the good times couldn' t last forever.'
Please!
'I think Allison had been screaming all day
'but it hadn' t really registered before.
'She might have been screaming for a week.
'It was days since I' d heard anyone speak.
'Though surely someone must have said something
'in all that time.'
Allison?
Allison!
- Help me, please!
- Cool down!
Everything' s gonna be just fine.
'Nothing could' ve been further from the truth.
'In fact, nothing was gonna be just fine.
'On the contrary, everything was gonna be bad.
'Everything was gonna be even worse than it already was.'
Fuck!
'It wasn' t my baby.
'She wasn' t my baby.
'Baby Dawn - she wasn' t mine.
'Sick Boy' s...
'I dunno.
Maybe not.
'I wished I could think of something to say -
'something human.'
Say something, Mark.
Fucking say something!
I' m cooking up.
Cook us up a shot, Rents.
I really need a hit.
'And so she did -
'I could understand that.
'To take the pain away.
'So I cooked up
'and she got a hit.
'that went without saying.
'Well, we knew who the father was now.
'It wasn' t just the baby that died that day.
'Something inside Sick Boy was lost and never returned.
Nor did I.
'Our only response was to keep going and fuck everything.
'Pile misery on misery.
'and dissolve it.
'Then squirt it into a vein
'Keep on going out, robbing, fucking people over.
'Propelling ourselves with longing
'you never have enough.
'you always need to do it all over again.
'Sooner or later,
Shoplifting is theft, which is a crime, and there is no such entity as victimless crime.
Heroin addiction explains but doesn' t excuse your actions.
Mr Murphy, you are a habitual thief, devoid of remorse.
I worry it will not be long till we meet again.
Mr Renton, you have entered a programme of rehabilitation in an attempt to wean yourself away from heroin.
The suspension of your sentence depends on your continued cooperation with this programme.
Stand guilty before me again and I won' t hesitate to impose a custodial sentence.
Thank you, Your Honour.
With God' s help, I' il conquer this terrible affliction.
'What can you say?
'Begbie had a phrase for it.'
It was obvious that cunt was gonna fuck some cunt.
Have you learnt your lesson?
I thought I was gonna lose you.
You' re nothing but trouble but I still love you!
- Cut that shite out.
- Francis is talking sense.
See, inside, you wouldn' t last two days.
Choose life.
My wee baby.
# Loves shortening, shortening
# Mamma' s little baby loves shortening bread!
I' m sorry, Mrs Murphy.
It wasn' t fair, Spud going down and not me.
Well, it' s no 'our fault!
Your boy went down because he was a smackhead.
If that' s not your fault then I don' t know what is.
I tried to get him off it.
I' il get the drinks in, eh?
'Wish I' d gone down, not Spud.
'and so- called mates
'Never in my puff.
'they' ve had me on this programme.
'The State- sponsored addiction.
'instead of smack.
It' s never enough.
'I took all three earlier.
'and the sweat on my back' s like a layer of frost.
'I need to visit the Mother Superior for one hit.
'to get us over this long, hard day.'
What' s on the menu this evening, sir?
- Excellent.
- Usual table, sir?
- Why, thank you.
Would sir care to pay for his bill in advance?
No, stick it on my tab.
Credit limit was reached and breached some time ago.
Ah, hard currency.
That' il do nicely.
Can' t be too careful when dealing with your type, sir.
Would sir care for a starter?
- Some garlic bread?
- No, thanks.
I' il proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs.
As you wish, sir.
As you wish.
Perhaps sir would like me to call for a taxi?
Wake up!
Come on, wake up!
'but it' s in the post, that' s for sure.
'I' m in the junkie limbo at the moment.
'too tired to stay awake.'
'But the sickness is on its way.
'pain and craving.
'Need like nothing else I' ve ever known
'It' s on its way.
# Ooh, you' ve got green eyes
# Ooh, you' ve got blue eyes
# Ooh, you' ve got grey eyes
# Quite like you before
# Quite like you before
We' il help you, son.
You stay here till you get better.
We' il beat this together.
- I should go to the clinic.
- No.
No clinics.
No methadone.
It made you worse.
You said so yourself.
You lied to us, son.
Your own mother and father!
You can bring some jellies...
No!
You' re worse coming off that than you are with the heroin.
A clean break this time.
We' il keep an eye on you.
I appreciate what you' re trying to do but just bring me one more hit, plea...
I need one more fucking hit!
You fuck!
Fuck it!
Well... this is a good fucking laugh, isn' t it?
You sweat that shite out your system.
If I come back and it' s still here,
I' il fucking kick it out.
OK?
God!
Question number one.
The human immunodeficiency virus is a...?
Retrovirus.
Retrovirus is the right answer!
It' s a mug' s game, Mrs Renton.
I mean, I' m not saying I was blameless myself.
The time comes when you have to turn your back on that nonsense and just say no.
Just say no.
She' s dead!
Question number two.
HlV binds to which receptor on the host lymphocyte?
Which receptor is that?
CD4.
CD4 is the right answer!
Better than sex, Rents?
Better than sex?
I' m a fucking adult,
I can find out for myself.
Well, I' m finding out, all right!
Tommy!
Just fucking stop.
Stop it.
Is he guilty... or not guilty?
He' s our son.
Stop looking at me!
Stop!
Mark!
There' s something you need to do.
Come alive, 35.
Mark!
Mark, you' ve got a house!
House!
House!
For goodness sake, Mark.
'I really am the luckiest guy in the world.
'surrounded by the living dead.
'But not me.
I' m negative.
'It' s official.
'that' s when the real battle starts.
'Depression, boredom -
'you' re so low, you want to top yourself.'
Tommy!
Tommy, it' s Mark, man.
All right, mate?
No.
Following the game at all?
Nah.
Me neither, really.
Did you take the test?
Aye.
Clear?
Aye.
That' s nice.
I' m sorry, Tommy.
I' m clean, man.
Well... sub us then, mate.
I' m expecting a rent cheque.
Thanks, Mark.
No bother.
'No bother.
'None at all.
'Not for me, anyway.
'when it' s some other poor cunt with shite for blood.'
- What do you want?
- Are you clean?
- Yes.
- Is that a promise?
- It is, actually!
- I' m only asking.
- No.
- I wouldn' t mind some.
- It isn' t.
- It smells like it.
- You' re too young.
- I' m too young for what?
You' re not getting any younger, Mark.
The world' s changing, music' s changing, even drugs are changing.
You can' t stay in dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
It' s Iggy Pop.
Whatever.
The guy' s dead, anyway.
Iggy toured last year.
Tommy went to see him.
The point is, you' ve got to find something new.
I had to find something new.
'Only one thing for it.'
Lifestyle Letting Agency.
A beautifully converted Victorian townhouse.
'near to local shops.
'This one' s two bedrooms and a kitchen/ diner.
Excellent decorative order.
'And it' s going at... £320 a week.
'kept myself to myself.
'but mainly, I didn' t miss them.
'This was boom town
'where any fool could make cash from chaos.'
I' ve got a beautifully converted Victorian townhouse.
'takeovers, lending, letting,
Who' s got the keys to Talgarth Road?
'If society existed, I had nothing to do with it.
'I was almost content.'
'Dear Mark,
'Glad you found a job and somewhere to live.
'School' s fine at the moment.
'I' m not pregnant - thanks for asking.
'I told him where to go.
He sends his regards.
'I think that' s what he said.'
'No- one has seen Tommy for ages.
'And Francis Begbie has been on TV a lot.
'He' s wanted by the police
'because of an armed robbery in a jeweller' s.
'Take care.
'Francis Begbie...'
Armed robbery?
How could it be armed robbery with a fucking replica?
A scandal.
Look.
Supposed to be solid silver - it' s fucking garbage!
- It' s a scandal.
- Fucking right.
Another one of the wee Pot Noodles?
I' m fucking Lee Marvin!
Hey, Rents.
'Begbie settled in in no time at all.'
I' ve no fucking cigarettes.
It' s me.
Rents!
'Yeah, the guy' s a psycho.
'But it' s true -
'he' s a mate an' all so what can you do? '
Can you no 'go yourself?
Seeing as I' m a fugitive from the law and I cannae walk the fucking streets, you go.
Here.
Four forty.
Five pound to win - Bad Boy.
Bring some fucking beer an 'all.
Come on, Bad Boy.
Come on, son.
Come on, son.
Bad Boy!
'Came in at 16 to one.
'And with the winnings,
'Diane was right -
'the world is changing.
'Music is changing,
'drugs are changing.
Men and women are changing.
'there' il be no guys or girls, just wankers.
'Sounds great to me.
'It' s just a pity no- one told Begbie.'
Fuck!
Fuck!
'It' s just a question of who you fancy.
'It' s all about aesthetics and fuck all to do with morality.'
Fuck!
'But you try telling Begbie that.'
I' m not a fucking buftie!
It could have been wonderful.
Fucking listen to me, piece of junkie shit!
You mention that again and I' il cut you up.
You understand?
'Since I last saw him,
'And was here, he said, to mix business and pleasure.
Good chips.
I can' t believe you did that.
I got a good price for it.
- It was my fucking telly!
I wouldn' t have bothered.
Fucking rented, anyway.
You gonna eat that?
Have you got a passport?
Why?
Runs a hotel...
Brothel.
Loads of contacts.
Does a nice side- line in punting British passports to foreigners.
Get you a good price.
And why would I want to sell my passport?
It was just an idea.
'I had to get rid of them.
'Sick Boy didn' t do his drug deal and didn' t get rich.
'He and Begbie hung around my bedsit looking to steal things.
'I decided to put them in the worst place in the world.'
'But of course, they weren' t paying any rent.
'So when my boss found two suckers who would,
'Sick Boy and Begbie were bound to feel threatened.'
All mod cons.
'And that was that.
'But we had another reason to go back.
Tommy. '
Tommy knew he had the virus but not that he' d gone full- blown.
Was it pneumonia or cancer?
No - toxoplasmosis.
How' s that?
He wanted to see Lizzy again.
She wouldn' t let him near the house.
So he bought her a present.
This kitten.
Bet Lizzy told him where to fuckin 'stick it.
So there' s Tommy stuck with this kitten.
You can imagine what happened.
To those gathered here today,
Thomas McKenzie filled a number of roles in our lives...
The thing was neglected.
Pissing and shitting all over.
Tommy' s lying about fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers.
He never knew you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
He had a great lust for life.
Neither did I. What is it?
Fucking horrible.
Fucking hell.
Then what happened?
He starts getting headaches.
So he uses more smack, you know, for the pain, like.
And then he has a stroke.
A fucking stroke!
Gets home from the hospital and dies three weeks later.
He' d been dead for ages before neighbours complained about the smell and got the police to break down the door.
The kitten was fine.
All please rise for the committal.
# Did you think I would leave you crying

# Don' t be dying
# I can go just as fast with two
# We' il both be soldiers
# And our horses will not be toys
# And I wonder if we' il remember

Did you tell him yet?
- On you go.
- What?
Swanney' s mate...
You know him - Mikey Forrester.
Aye.
He' s come into some gear.
- A lot of gear.
- How much gear?
About two kilos.
So he tells me.
Met two Russian sailors.
They' re fucking carrying the stuff.
For sale there and then, like.
He wakes up next morning, realises what he' s done, gets very nervous.
He wants rid of this.
So?
So, he met me.
I offered to take it at a reasonable price so I could punt it on to a guy in London.
We' re just back from Tommy' s funeral and you' re discussing a skag deal?
Aye.
- Four grand.
- You haven' t got four grand.
We' re 2, 000 short.
Well, that' s tough.
Mark, every cunt knows you' ve been saving up down in London.
I don' t have two grand.
You fucking do.
I' ve seen your bank statement.
For fuck' s sake!
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pound.
Two kilos.
What' s that, ten years?
Mikey Forrester, Russian sailors - what the fuck are you on?
Spud, you' ve been to jail.
You want to go back?
I just want the money.
Keep your mouths shut and no cunt goes to jail.
'about what might happen in London.
'Ideas best kept to myself.
'What no- one told me was that when we bought the skag,
'Begbie didn' t trust Spud
'and Sick Boy was too careful these days.
'I spiked my vein
It' s good.
Oh, it' s really fucking good!
'That hit was good.
'I promised myself another before I got to London.
'Just one, for old time' s sake.
'This was his nightmare.
'The dodgiest scam in a life of dodgy scams.
'and unreliable fuck- ups in town.
'I knew what was going on in his mind -
'any trouble in London and he would dump us.
'on top of that armed robbery, he' d go down for 15 to 20.
'that he didn' t shite it off 20 years in Saughton.
'This was to be my final hit.
'But let' s be clear -
'there' s final hits and final hits.
'What kind was this to be?'
What?
- I told you to mind the cards.
- I' ve not brought them.
I' m sorry.
- Bit fucking late, like.
- Why didn' t you bring them?
I told you to, doss cunt!
Christ!
These your friends, right?
These are the guys I told you about.
- Well, is he here?
- Yeah, he' s here.
You didn' t get followed or nothing?
Didn' t get followed.
OK.
- Hi.
'Straight away,
'Small- time wasters with an accidental big deal.'
Excuse me, gentlemen.
So... how much would you like for this?
20, 000.
I don' t think it' s worth much more than 15.
'He didn' t need to negotiate.
'What would we do if he didn' t buy it?
'Sell it on the streets?
Fuck that. '
Well, 19.
I can' t go to 19.
Well, fucking 16 then.
OK.
Well, fucking 16 it is, then.
These, gentlemen, are £2, 000 bundles.
That' s four...
'We settled on £16, 000.
'He' d a lot more in his suitcase
'but it was better than nothing.'
Thank you, gentlemen.
May I say it' s been a pleasure haggling with you.
Fucking brand new.
'For a moment,
'it felt great.
'like it meant something.
'A moment like that can touch you
'but it doesn' t last long.
Not like £16, 000. '
Spud, any investments planned?
Gonna buy an island in the sun?
For 4, 000?
One palm tree and a sewage outflow!
I don' t know, man.
I' m gonna get something for my ma.
And some good speed.
No bicarb.
And shag her?
No, man!
True love.
True love.
But I could handle hot sex with a Jewish princess tonight!
Ya daft cunt!
- Or a Catholic.
Get the drinks.
I got a round already.
I got the last one.
Your round, Franco.
Same again?
- I' m off for a piss.
See when I get back, that money' s still here, OK?
No, we' re out the door.
I' il be after you.
You' il never catch us, flabby.
But when I get back...
Be halfway down the street with the money.
- I' d fucking kill you.
- I thought you might.
Thought you might.
Are you game for it?
What?
Are you serious?
Don' t know.
Don' t know.
What d' you think?
- Oh, aye.
- Wouldn' t run out on a mate.
- I would.
Where' s Franco?
For fuck' s sake!
I' il buy you another.
You ruined my fucking suit, you fucking idiot!
I' m sorry.
"Sorry" won' t dry me off, you cunt.
He says he' s sorry.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
You can' t even hold a pint.
Now fuck off!
No, Franco, no...
For fuck' s sake!
Fucking nice one, Franco (!)
- You cut me, man!
- You were in my way.
You?
We' d better go.
To hospital.
Stay there.
You bring me down a fucking cigarette.
And the bag.
'in all sorts of ways.
'just a minor betrayal.
'Or we' d outgrown each other,
'that sort of thing.
'But let' s face it, I ripped them off -
'my so- called mates.
'But Begbie, I couldn' t give a shit about him.
'And Sick Boy, he' d have done the same to me,
'if he' d only thought of it first.
'And Spud...
'He never hurt anybody.
Bastard!
Open up.
Open up now!
'So why did I do it?
'I could offer a million answers, all false.
'The truth is that I' m a bad person.
'But that' s gonna change.
'I' m going to change.
This is the last of that.
'Now I' m cleaning up, going straight and choosing life.
'I' m looking forward to it.
'I' m gonna be just like you -
'Good health, low cholesterol,
My name is Happy Gilmore.
Ever since I was old enough to skate, I loved hockey.
I wasn´t reaIly the greatest skater.
But that didn´t keep my dad from teaching me...... the secret of making a great slap shot.
My dad worshipped hockey.
My mom didn´t.
So she moved to Egypt, where there´s not a hockey rink within 1500 miles.
Dad took me to games to see our favorite player...... Terry O´ReiIly, "The Tasmanian Devil".
He wasn´t a big guy, but he feared nobody, just Iike me.
Handsome feIlow, huh?
He said when I grew up, I could be anything.
But aII I ever wanted to be was a hockey player.
My childhood was going great, but Iife is fuII of surprises.
After the funeral, I was sent to Iive with my grandma in Waterbury.
I was nervous, since I didn´t know her that weIl.
She dressed Iike Gene Simmons from KlSS to cheer me up.
She´s the sweetest person in the world.
After my dad died, I developed a short fuse.
That kid stole my party blower.
Instead of asking for it back, I hit him in the head repeatedly... with a hammer.
Most of the time, I was quick to say I was sorry.
Years Iater, I played junior hockey and stiII hold two Ieague records...... most time spent in a penalty box...... and I was the only guy to ever try to stab someone with his skates.
After I graduated, I had a Iot of different jobs.
I was a road worker...... a janitor...
... a security guard...
... a gas station attendant...
... and a plumber.
Lately, I´ve been working construction.
It´s not bad.
I´m a good shot with a naiI gun.
But one day my boss, Mr. Larson, got in the way.
Apparently, he also has a short fuse.
Look at the monster.
He got in a few Iucky punches, but I feeI I won the fight.
Anyway, those jobs weren´t for me.
I was put on this planet for one reason -- to play hockey.
It´s my puck, baby!
Don´t you ever touch my puck!
Is that Gilmore again?
How many times has he tried out?
At Ieast ten times.
He has a Iot of intensity.
Not a strong skater, though.
Nor the best puck handler.
But, my God...
What a shot.
It that goaI regulation size or what?!
Number one...... number fifty- two... number sixteen...
They saw my power.
They won´t dog me this year.... number nine...... and number forty- three.
The rest of you...... better Iuck next year.
Coach, what´s going on?
What about me?
Gilmore.
I caIled your number, didn´t I?
No, you didn´t.
WeIl, better Iuck next year.
That wasn´t very nice!
You think you´re better than me?!
Where you going?
I got Subway.
I already ate.
I knew the guy working there, so we got extra meatbaIls.
Great.
I got to run.
Can you stay?
I had a rough day.
Bye.
- When wiII you be back?
- Never.
Terry, wait!
Wait!
Hold on a second, babe.
You´re not going for good, are you?
You´re going nowhere and taking me with you.
AII you ever talk about is being a pro hockey player, but you´re not any good.
You know what?
You´re a Iousy kindergarten teacher!
I saw the finger paintings you bring home -- they suck!
I didn´t mean that.
They´re exceIlent finger paintings.
Please don´t go.
I´m not spending the rest of my Iife with a Ioser.
I´m gone.
Good!
Get the heII out of my Iife!
Who needs you?
Beat it!
I didn´t mean that.
I just yeII ´cause I get so scared.
Scared of being a nobody.
Why don´t you come back upstairs, honey?
I´II give you the old smoochy- smoo kissy- wissy.
You know Happy wiII make everything okay.
And over and again
TiII the night closes in
TiII the night closes in
Terry!
I´II be right over.
Hey, you don´t want breakfast?
Grandma?
Put that down!
It´s my grandmother´s!
Cut it out, kid.
We´re just doing our job.
What are you talking about?
Your grandmother hasn´t paid taxes in 10 years.
Grandma, you didn´t pay your taxes?
I would have, but I didn´t have any money.
Where are you taking her stuff?
I´m not taking her stuff, the government is.
It´s not Iike I´m taking her stuff over to my place.
Don´t get mad at me.
But she´s an old Iady.
Look at her.
She´s old.
You can´t just take her stuff.
She´s too old.
I have no discretion.
Her stuff is now our stuff.
WeIl, at Ieast we got the house.
I´II bring furniture from my place.
We´II be okay.
Now you´II reaIly be mad.
I´m taking the house, too.
My grandfather built this house with his bare hands.
My grandma´s been here over 60 years.
You can´t take her house.
Mrs. Gilmore owes the IRS usd270, 000 in back taxes.
We have to take the house.
If you can´t repay the money in 90 days, we seII the house to someone else.
You hate me, don´t you?
No, I don´t hate you.
He hates me.
Don´t worry - things wiII be okay.
Look at this place.
Silver Acres Rest Home.
It Iooks more Iike a country club.
Nice grass, nice people.
I hope you brought your bathing suit.
You´re going to make friends in no time.
Mister!
Get me out of here!!!
Here, eat that!
Leave us alone!
Grandma, you could come Iive with me.
Nonsense, dear.
You´re a grown man.
I wouldn´t burden you Iike that and that´s final.
TeII me, how is that nice girlfriend of yours?
She got hit by a car.
She´s dead.
Listen, I wiII get that usd270, 000 and get your house back.
I promise.
Oh, sure.
In the meantime, just stay here and have some fun.
I wiIl, dear.
Don´t worry.
Pardon me, but it´s nap time.
Nap time -- that sounds nice.
- You go.
- I love you.
I love you, too, darling.
You see that Iady?
She´s very important to me.
I want you to take extra speciaI care of her.
You know what I mean?
I can´t accept that.
But this is what I can do.
I can take extra speciaI care of that young Iady for nothing.
I appreciate that.
Have a nice afternoon.
Sir, could I trouble you for a glass of warm milk?
It helps put me to sleep.
You could trouble me for a warm glass of shut the heII up.
Go to sleep or I wiII put you to sleep.
Check out the name tag.
You´re in my world now, Grandma.
Oh, dear.
Bet you I can hit a baII past that tree.
Twenty bucks says you can´t.
Morons, I told you I want to watch the hockey game.
Cut the golf sissy crap and finish up.
Oh, relax.
You can enjoy your grandma´s possessions for another half hour.
Oh, you got a hold of that one!
- You try it.
- It´s not as easy as it Iooks.
Sorry, Iadies.
I´m not the golfing type.
You hit a baII past my baIl...... we´II finish work so you can watch your hockey game.
Give me the stupid club.
Look at this stupid thing.
This wiII be hilarious.
Look how he´s standing.
You Iike that?
Holy shit.
Back to work.
That house is 400 yards away.
Is that good?
- That´s unbelievable.
- Beginner´s Iuck.
I bet usd20 you can´t do it again.
Bring it on.
You boys are going to pay for that --
- You hit him!
- He shouldn´t have been standing there.
One more time.
Double or nothing.
You better pay up.
Maybe we should get back inside.
Pay the man.
Thanks.
TeII your friends.
Step right up, folks!
See if you can outdrive the amazing Golf BaIl, uh, Whacker Guy!
That´s great.
Very good.
Bend your knees.
Remember, it´s in the hips.
You´re doing great.
It´s in the hips.
Fifty bucks I can hit it over the highway.
That´s reaI good.
So Iong, sucker.
How often do you play?
This is my first time.
You should play in the Waterbury Open tomorrow.
Yeah, right, I´II see you there.
He´s going to play.
And, by God, he´s going to win.
Mister, you need a helmet.
Don´t worry about it.
Yeah, bring that shit on.
I love it.
Awesome.
God, that hurt, but I´m okay.
What the heII are you doing?
Just 364 more days tiII the next hockey tryouts.
I got to get tough.
God, that felt good.
Cut that out.
You´re making me sick.
So you´re a hockey player.
You got to give that up and concentrate on golf.
Who are you?
I´m the club pro here -- Chubbs Peterson.
I´m offering to teach you how to play golf, personaIly, for free.
No.
You don´t know who I am, do you?
No, I don´t.
Back in 1965...... Sports illustrated said I would be the next Arnold Palmer.
What happened?
I wasn´t aIlowed to play pro anymore.
I´m sorry.
Because you´re black?
HeIl, no.
An aIligator bit my hand off.
Oh, my God!
Tournament in Florida.
My baII went down by a Iake.
Damn aIligator just popped up!
Cut me down in my prime.
But I tore one of that bastard´s eyes out.
Look at that.
You´re pretty sick, Chubbs.
I´ve never seen anyone...... who can hit the baII half as far as you.
You got reaI talent.
That´s nice of you to say, but I trained aII my Iife to play hockey.
Golf is no different -- requires talent, self- discipline.
Golf requires goofy pants and a fat ass.
Talk to my neighbor -- a great golfer.
I bet your neighbor can´t drive the baII 400 yards.
I bet your neighbor doesn´t have a shot to get on the Pro Tour.
How would I do that?
You win the Open tomorrow, you´re on the Pro Tour.
Then, who knows?
Maybe you´II win the Tour Championship.
Get that gold jacket I never got.
Gold jacket, green jacket -- who cares?
Don´t worry.
It´s made of wood -- reaI sturdy.
Sorry about that.
It was good to meet you, but, uh....
I´m out of here.
This is not reaI smart, kid.
I thought you were pro material, primed for the big bucks.
Hey, Chubbs...... what kind of big bucks?
Stupid golf clubs.
Why the heII am I doing this?
Whoa -- must be Burt Reynolds or something.
Good morning!
Isn´t this great?
Blue skies, fresh- cut grass, birds chirping.
You going to recite me a poem?
Geez, you love this golf stuff.
A guy your size -- why not play a reaI sport, Iike footbaIl?
My mama wouldn´t Iet me.
Said it was too dangerous.
Yeah, good caIl.
Hey, who´s that?
The shorter guy is Doug Thompson, president of the Tour.
The other guy is Shooter McGavin, Ieading money winner this year.
Who´s the girl?
I´m Virginia Venit, Director of Public Relations for the Tour.
Of course.
I´ve heard you´ve done some reaIly interesting things.
Right now I´m working on a promotion --
You know what would be great?
If I could get a Pepsi.
Sure.
Oh, miss?
Diet.
Right.
Hey, thanks for dressing up.
If I wore clothes Iike those, I´d have to kick my own ass.
Good morning, everyone.
Welcome to the Waterbury Open.
Before we begin, I have a treat for you.
Ladies and gentlemen, Shooter McGavin.
Thank you, Doug.
I saw Doug play yesterday.
He spends more time in the sand than David Hasselhoff.
You´re aII aware...... today´s winner wiII be invited to join the Pro Tour.
Although only one wiII become my coIleague...... aII of you are now my friends.
Thank you.
Now go get ´em!
Next up:
Lafferty, DanieI and Gilmore... Happy.
Where you taking those clubs, punk?!
Mr. Gilmore, I´m your caddy.
Sorry.
I´II carry these.
They´re my grandfather´s.
They´re pretty old.
What should I do then?
Why don´t you just watch me...... and make sure I don´t do anything stupid?
Mr. Gilmore, Mr. Lafferty is teeing off now.
Okay.
Good Iuck, buddy.
Get out of the way.
Where were you that time, dipshit?
Probably the best I´II hit aII day.
Mr. Gilmore, you´re up.
Damn it!
Time!
Relax.
Do what we discussed.
Don´t Iook at the green.
There´s no goalie anywhere to block it.
Remember, it´s aII in the hip.
Work with me.
AII in the hips.
It´s aII in the hips.
Get off me!
Just easing the tension.
WeIl, ease it on someone else.
What the heIl?
Good.
Now we just worry about putting.
Oh, yeah.
Putting.
Remember what I said.
Use your shoulders to push the baIl, not the arms.
Don´t break the wrist.
Whoa, you´re confusing me.
Just Iet me put the baII in the hole.
Is he kidding?
This is pathetic.
Good shot.
It´s about time.
True.
I just couldn´t get the baII in the hole.
I wanted to, but I couldn´t.
He shoots, he scores!
That was much easier than putting.
I should try and do that every time.
Good plan.
- Did you see that?
Nice.
He got a hole in one on a par four.
I said I saw it.
I hope he wins.
He´s a publicist´s dream.
A guy who can drive the baII that far -- he could reaIly draw a crowd.
So could a golfer with an arm growing out of his ass.
Now, you make this one in four or Iess shots...... you win the tournament.
Four shots.
The other team has puIled their goalie.
It´s wide open.
AII you have to do is tap it in.
I can do that.
You´re doing fine.
AII you have to do is tap it in.
Just tap it in.
Just tap it in.
Just tap it in.
Just tap it in.
Give it a Iittle tappy.
Tap, tap, tap- a- roo.
Grandma, Grandma...... Grandma, Grandma.
AII right!
He´s going to be on the Tour.
Super.
That´s cute.
Mr. Gilmore, Virginia Venit.
I´m P. R. Director of the Tour.
Nice to meet you.
Congratulations.
That must be a record.
I got a hockey record.
I tried to stab someone with my skate.
Nobody else ever did that.
That´s wonderful.
I am a bit bummed.
I thought we got money for this.
And the guy who comes in Iast? usd2, 400.
So no matter what, I´II get some money.
Yeah.
WeIl, I´II see you next week then.
Bye.
I hate to admit this, but this is my first trophy.
I wish that goofy golf guy wasn´t on top.
Maybe I´II put a hockey guy on instead.
Happy, shut your trap.
- You were great out there today.
- Thank you.
But not that great.
A Iot of that was Iuck.
Some might caII it Iuck.
I Iike to caII it...... weIl, Iuck, I guess.
So what?
Don´t join the Pro Tour yet.
We got work to do before you go against professionals.
Forget it.
I´II pick up the rest as I go.
Don´t be a fool!
People would kiII to hit the Iong baII Iike you.
You got an advantage over any other golfer.
By developing the rest of your game...... you´d be unstoppable.
You´re right, but I need money.
Don´t be an asshole.
Give me six months.
I´II work with you every day.
No, I got to go.
I appreciate everything.
Wish me Iuck.
Best of Iuck.
Marty, shut up and I´II teII you.
The price is usd200 per quilt.
WeIl, this is handmade quality shit.
When do you need them by?
Okay.
Good doing business with you.
Okay, everyone.
Announcement.
Good news -- arts and crafts time is extended 4 hours.
My fingers hurt.
What´s that?
My fingers hurt.
WeIl, soon your back wiII hurt because you just got Iandscaping duty.
Anyone else´s fingers hurt?
I didn´t think so.
Why do you make me act Iike that, huh?
Mr. Gilmore!
Toidy´s to the right, dear.
- How´s Grandma?
- Super.
It´s arts and crafts time.
Grandma is quite a quilter.
That´s a tremendous trophy.
Happy, I´m so glad to see you.
I´m glad to see you, too.
I think about you aII the time.
Looks Iike everyone´s having fun here.
Good news -- I made the ProfessionaI Golfers´ Tour.
That´s Iovely.
You know what else is Iovely?
If I can beat those other guys... we´II get the house back.
Oh, thank God!
I can´t stand to Iive in this place another minute!
I thought you Iiked it here.
That orderly is nice.
Don´t you Iike him?
Oh, I do.
It´s just that the air conditioner´s broken.
I´m getting a Iittle warm.
Let the kid fix it for you.
Get the Iittle twisty knobs.
That ain´t doing it.
Okay.
Mister!
Mister!
Get this off of me!
Mister!
I´II be right down!
You know that "Mister, mister" Iady?
I think I kiIled her.
Norman spends more time in the sand than David Hasselhoff.
Come on, that was funny.
- It was the first time I heard it.
- Drink up.
Anyone tapped the keg yet?
I´m Happy Gilmore.
Mark Lye.
Welcome to the Tour.
I heard about the ace you had on a par four.
Impressive.
You heard about that?
That´s a nice jacket.
You get one if you win the Tour Championship.
Oh, yeah?
What´s that?
Only the biggest tournament of the year.
Oh, reaIly?
Where´s yours?
Good one.
I´II have mine in three months.
Not if I have anything to do with it.
Whoa, Iook out.
You better Iook out.
If you´re free, join us at 9: 00 on the ninth green.
- What happens there?
- Secret of the pros.
AII right, cool.
Peace.
And, Happy... dress nice, huh?
AII right, aII right.
Almost nine o´clock.
Public relations Iady, you seen Shooter McGavin?
Why?
- I need to beat the piss out of him.
Let me guess -- the ninth green at nine trick.
It would appear so.
He does deserve a beating.
But if you beat him up, I´II have to explain to the papers...... why the new guy beat up Shooter McGavin.
More work for me.
I don´t want to do that.
Forget about Shooter.
He´s just threatened by you.
He´s afraid you´II steaI his thunder.
That´s nice of you to say.
So, I´m going to go change now.
My girlfriend´s dead.
She feII off a cliff and died on impact.
ReaIly?
I´m sorry to hear that.
You should get some sleep.
Tomorrow´s a big day.
It is.
I´m Verne Lundquist, with Jack Beard.
We have a nice crowd here on this sun- sationaI ApriI morning...... for the 22nd annuaI AT& T Invitational.
Here today are elite golfers from around the world.
The favorite is Shooter McGavin.
He´s won three of the Iast four.
Thanks, man.
Here´s my Iast buck.
This is the Iast time.
Leave him alone.
I don´t know why I´m winning.
The hole seems to get bigger.
You Iike being the favorite?
With the great players here, anyone could win.
I´II just do my best.
The reaI favorite is Portland.
Every time I visit, it´s harder to Ieave.
Must be something in the water.
WeIl, time to play golf.
Good Iuck.
I´m a hockey player playing golf today.
Name?
Happy Gilmore.
The guy with the Iong drive.
- Caddy´s name?
- You haven´t given me one yet.
On the Pro Tour, you provide your own.
ReaIly?
Okay.
They´re antiques.
Gary Potter.
Great to have you on the Tour.
I feeI a Iot of solid energy coming out of you.
Good positive aura.
Nice to meet you.
Is it always Iike this -- TV cameras, people and stuff?
Yeah, a Iot of pressure.
Rise above it.
Harness in the good energy, block out the bad.
Harness energy, block bad.
FeeI the flow, Happy.
It´s circular.
It´s Iike a carousel.
It goes up, down and around.
Circular.
Circle.
With the music, the flow.
AII good things.
Okay.
WeIl, great.
Nice to meet you.
Psycho.
Next to tee off, Happy Gilmore.
Give me a club.
I´II get it.
Fu --, sh --, fu --, ass --
Sorry.
Psycho.
What a shot by Happy Gilmore!
Who the heII is Happy Gilmore?
Oh, yeah!
I got it!
Like that, baby?
Plenty more where that came from!
Get Virginia Venit in here, now.
Use a five iron.
You think so?
Give me my wedge.
Five iron, huh?
Bye- bye.
What are you doing, Happy -- riding a buIl?
You´re acting Iike a damn fool!
Doing the buII dance.
Working it.
On the 18th green, Shooter McGavin putts for the win.
His crowd seems unusuaIly smaII for this type of moment.
Most people are over watching Happy Gilmore.
He´s the talk of the course...... with his huge drives and bizarre behavior.
He´s on the 17th green right now, having trouble closing out his day.
Happy, the baII has its own energy or Iife force, if you wiIl.
Its naturaI environment is in the hole.
Why don´t you send him home?
He has his plane ticket.
Bring him to the airport.
Send him home.
I´II send him home.
It´s time to go home, baIl.
Son of a bitch baIl!
Why didn´t you go home?!
That´s your home!
Are you too good for your home?!
Answer me!
Suck my white ass, baIl!
Draft a press release stating Gilmore is being thrown off the Tour.
I want to see it by 6: 00 p. m.
You´re right -- his behavior is completely unacceptable.
But golf has been waiting for a player Iike this.
A colorful, emotional, working class hero.
I wiII not tolerate this behavior.
Gilmore is gone.
I got a caII from the DaIlas Open.
They´re deluged with caIls from people who want to see Happy.
- They sold out.
- Already?
I know he´s a Iittle rough.
Let me work with him.
Okay.
Fine.
But he´s your responsibility.
If he cleans up, he can stay.
If he doesn´t, it´s your ass.
And any more of this...
... and he´s gone.
Shooter!
Shooter!
What do you think of Happy Gilmore?
I didn´t see him play.
I was too busy winning.
But a 450- yard drive is impressive.
Where did he finish again?
Dead Iast?
Yeah, he had a good day.
Did he reaIly make a 450- yard ace?
Where´s my check?
We maiI them next week.
I want mine now.
I don´t have any checks.
He got one.
Give me one of them big ones, I don´t care.
Give me a beer, pal.
Put that on my tab.
You were the talk of the tournament, Gilmore.
Wow, thanks a Iot.
You sure crush the baII at the tee.
You´d do weII in a Iong- drive contest.
You´d make good money, traveling, hustling at driving ranges.
I know what you´re doing right now...... and I don´t Iike it.
So just shut your trap before I put my foot in it.
Don´t turn your back on me.
Listen, this is Shooter´s tour.
I worked hard, paid my dues -- now it´s Shooter´s turn.
Shooter won´t Iet his reign at the top be spoiled by some freak.
Did you caII me a freak?
I was on this tour for one reason -- money.
Now I got a new one -- kicking your ass.
I´d Iike to see you try.
Let´s do it.
I meant at golf.
What´s going on here?
I was Iooking for the other half of this bottle.
Oh, there´s some of it right there.
- Why don´t you put it down?
- I know.
Listen to what I say.
Why don´t I go eat some hay?
I could make things out of clay and Iay by the bay.
What do you say?
Calm down or you´II get kicked off the Tour.
- That can´t happen.
- It can, and I don´t want it to.
You could be a big star.
I just want to make some money.
You won´t be around Iong enough to do that if you don´t behave.
What do you mean by "behave"?
No swearing, no throwing clubs...... and especiaIly no hitting other players.
You mean no fun.
You can have fun.
That´s why I think people come to see you.
But keep it within reason.
I wiII work on what you caII behaving.
But I won´t act Iike a stiff.
Fine.
Thank you.
Hey, um...... you want to get some food?
No, thanks.
I don´t date golfers.
Good.
I´m a hockey player.
Just behave, okay?
Happy Gilmore approaches the tee in the 72nd annuaI Cleveland Classic.
Happy Gilmore!
Drive it 400 yards!
I waited aII my Iife for that.
Don´t be alarmed, Mr. Gilmore.
I know we had our problems, but I´m proud of you.
Thanks a Iot, Mr. Larson.
It´s good to see you again.
How´s that, uh, thing feeling?
Terrific.
The naiI comes out next week.
WeIl, you hardly even notice it.
Let´s make a Iittle noise here.
Come on!
I can´t hear you!
Trying to reach the green from here?
That´s not possible, sir.
I beg to differ.
Happy Gilmore accomplished that feat no more than an hour ago.
WeIl, moron, good for Happy -- Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Hey, Shooter, you forgot your nine iron.
A Iarge and economicaIly diverse crowd here at the Michelob Invitational.
It´s the tour sensation, Happy Gilmore...... who´s attracting aII types to this course.
I even saw one guy...... wearing one of those beer- dispensing helmets.
Damn you people.
Go back to your shanties.
This is a biggie, pal.
I got to make some reaI money.
What do you think?
Slightly downhiIl?
And slanting Ieft.
No, you think that ´cause you only got one shoe on.
Oh, yeah.
Happy Gilmore
You got the baIl?
Happy Gilmore from nine feet.
Here comes the putter throw.
He´s restrained himself.
Maybe this is a new Happy Gilmore.
Another tournament here in DaIlas, and Shooter McGavin wins again.
He´s won here 3 years in a row.
That son of a bitch!
Give me my baIl!
Give it here!
Cough it up, you dirty bastard!
I´II rip it out of you!
Give me --
Give me the baIl.
You have one eye.
Chubbs.
You took his hand.
He´s a hoot!
He´s bringing in some big crowds.
Today, one of his fans mooned me.
He had "HAPPY" written on his ass.
"HA" was on one cheek and "PPY" on the other.
I love what he´s doing for golf.
- WeIl, I´m starting to come around.
WeIl, I´m not, Doug!!
This man is destroying golf.
I saw two fat bikers in the woods off 17 having sex.
How can I chip with that going on?
- Kick him off the Tour.
- He hasn´t broken any rules.
He´s a disgrace to the game!
Yes, but our ratings are up.
We´re attracting new, youthfuI sponsors.
I´m sorry, Shooter.
There´s nothing I can do.
Then I´II have to take care of this myself.
So we´II get the house back?
As Iong as I don´t place Iast the next two times...... we´II get the money in time.
That´s wonderful, Happy.
I love you, Grandma.
Bye.
Good- bye, darling.
We should go on that date.
I´ve been pretty good Iately.
I hear you broke a rake and threw it in the woods.
I was testing its durability.
I put it in the woods because it´s made of wood...... and he should be with his family.
At Ieast I didn´t punch anyone.
Okay, we´II go on a date.
But just as friends.
Slow down.
I don´t want to be more than friends.
I just met you.
Fit you okay?
I haven´t skated since I was a Iittle kid.
Can we get a Iittle time here?
For Happy Gilmore, anything.
You played ice hockey?
Shut up.
Oh, my God... power failure.
It´s very scary in here.
No.
I thought we were going to be just friends.
Friends Iisten to "Endless Love" in the dark.
This song reminds me of seventh grade.
It reminds me of my grandmother.
That´s kind of weird.
She took me to see this movie.
I had the biggest crush on Brooke Shields.
My grandma told me I should write her a Ietter, so I did.
I got a Ietter back from Brooke two weeks Iater.
But it was in my grandmother´s handwriting.
Your grandma sounds sweet.
She is sweet.
That´s why I feeI so terrible.
Why?
No, forget it.
You can teII me.
She´s stuck in a nursing home.
The IRS repossessed her house.
That´s awful.
That´s why I joined the Tour.
I´m close to getting her house back.
Don´t teII anyone.
I´m kind of embarrassed.
I won´t teII anyone.
I´II make you a bet.
Do you always carry a puck?
Yeah.
Now, if you get that puck in the net over there...... I´II never bother you again.
But if you miss...... you have to give me a big, fat kiss.
And you have to pretend you Iike it.
ReaIly?
Good Iuck.
Shit.
Talk about your aIl- time backfires.
Happy...
... I didn´t see it go in.
Welcome to soggy San Francisco...... site of this year´s Pepsi Pro- Am.
HeIlo, Happy.
I´m Bob Barker.
Nice to meet you.
We´re playing together today.
That´s funny.
Who am I reaIly playing with?
In a Pro- Am, each golfer plays with a celebrity.
Nick Faldo and I won Iast year.
I´d Iike to win this year.
I´II do my best.
Hey, Gilmore?
You suck, you jackass.
Shut the heII up.
I´d love to punch that guy in the face, but I´d get in trouble.
You get this on "Let´s Make A Deal"?
"The Price Is Right", Happy.
Sorry.
It happens.
Let´s play some golf.
Jackass.
The club went further than the baIl.
What was that aII about?
It just slipped.
Get a blanket and suntan Iotion, ´cause you´II never get off that beach.
Just the way you never got into the NHL, you jackass!
The green´s that way.
You wiII not make this putt, you jackass.
Nice shooting, soldier.
AII right, Happy...... nice and easy.
That was not nice and easy.
That guy is driving me crazy.
What´s driving me crazy is you not getting the baII in the hole.
Don´t push me, Bob.
Now´s not the time.
Jackass.
This guy sucks!
We haven´t seen Gilmore play this badly since his first day on tour.
He and Bob Barker are now dead Iast.
You should be working at the snack bar, not playing golf.
Relax, Bob.
There is no way you could have been as bad at hockey as you are at golf.
Okay, Iet´s go.
You Iike that, old man?!
You want a piece of me?
I want the whole thing!
Now you´re gonna get it, Bobby!
The price is wrong, bitch.
I think you´ve had enough.
No?
Now you´ve had enough.
Bitch.
That couldn´t have gone better.
Instead of hitting you, he hits Bob Barker.
Perfect.
So, see you at the next tournament?
No need.
This was on nationaI TV.
Gilmore is gone.
Let´s get something at the Red Lobster.
My treat.
Some other time.
I thought we were friends.
We are.
I just have to go.
I´II be at the Red Lobster in case you change your mind.
God bless!
There you are.
Happy Gilmore, come on down!
Thank you, Shooter.
Sit down.
So you got in a fight with a game show host on nationaI TV.
That is not entertainment.
This is not hockey, no matter how much you want it to be.
I know that and I´m sorry.
But there was a guy out there...... giving me crap.
It took aII I had not to hit him.
So you head- butt Bob Barker?
Who won that fight, anyway?
Enough, Shooter.
The board has done the foIlowing:
Fined you usd25, 000 and suspended you for one month.
- What?!
I got to play!
Kick him off the Tour.
The board thinks that might be extreme...... considering the fact that our ratings were...... the highest we´ve ever had.
My grandmother´s house got repossessed.
If I don´t win more prize money, they´II seII it to someone else.
Whoop- dee- doo.
It´s over.
My grandmother wiII never see her house again.
But you´ve made a Iot of money.
You could buy her a nice condo.
My grandfather didn´t build any condos with his bare hands.
Damn it, I hate that Bob Barker.
There must be another way to get the usd50, 000.
I don´t want to talk about it.
I failed, okay?
Let me just enjoy the one thing that makes me a bit happy...... this fresh, delicious, tasty...... meaty, turkey- fiIled...... Cold Cut Combo.
I eat three every day just to keep me strong.
Hey, Happy...... can I have one of those?
Coming right up!
Talk about a hole in one.
Subway sandwiches wiII drive away your hunger.
What do you think?
I love it.
He Iooks so handsome.
And it makes me hungry.
They gave me a card that gives us free Subway for Iife.
That´s Iovely.
You know what else is Iovely?
Let´s go get your house back.
What the heIl?
What´s going on here?
It´s exciting.
We´re auctioning off your grandmother´s house.
You said if we got the money, we could buy it back.
You can buy it back.
Bidding wiII start at usd100, 000.
Do I hear 100?
This is the exciting part.
Have fun.
Look at aII these people.
What´s going on, Happy?
Thank you, two.
They´re auctioning it off.
Good.
We´II get it cheaper than we thought.
Two fifty, thank you.
Two seventy- five!
Two seventy- five.
And three.
Three fifty down front.
I have three fifty.
Seventy- five anywhere?
Three fifty -- sold to the gentleman in the white sweater.
What just happened, Happy?
Go wait in the car, Grandma.
What the heII is wrong with you?
I enjoy reaI estate speculation.
You touch me, I burn the house down and piss on the ashes.
What do you want for it?
You know what.
You off the Tour.
Quit, and the house is yours.
Fine.
I quit.
Happy, come here.
He´s right.
I´m a hockey player.
- What team do you play for?
- Easy.
Face it, Happy.
You are a golfer.
I did this to get Grandma´s house back.
No regrets.
What do you think she wants more -- to get her house back or see you succeed?
Maybe she can have both.
Hey, Shooter.
The Tour Championship is next week.
If I beat you, I get the house.
You beat me, I´II quit.
You´re going to beat me?
At golf?
You´re on.
But you´re in trouble.
I eat pieces of shit Iike you for breakfast.
You eat pieces of shit for breakfast?
No.
That was great.
I know you wiII kick his ass.
That makes one of us.
Take care of Grandma.
I´II walk from here.
- Where are you going?
- To Iearn to play golf.
I´m stupid, you´re smart.
I was wrong, you were right.
You´re the best, I´m the worst.
You´re very good- Iooking, I´m not attractive.
Okay, as Iong as you´re wiIling to admit that.
Now...... are you ready to work and do what I teII you?
Believe me, I´m ready.
Then Iet´s get to work.
I´m sorry.
Here.
Here´s your pinky.
"Happyland", just Iike me.
I´ve been here before.
This is embarrassing.
I´m a professionaI golfer, for God´s sake.
No, it´s your short game that´s embarrassing.
Let´s go.
Just Iine up the putt.
Don´t even Iook at the hole.
Aim for a spot six inches in front of the hole.
Line up with that.
Six inches.
This one´s very tough.
He´s Iaughing, having fun.
Enjoy your night.
Happy, concentrate.
I hate that clown.
Easy.
If you can´t beat the clown, how wiII you beat Shooter McGavin?
You´re gonna die, clown!
Is that funny?
I don´t hear you Iaughing now!
Enough.
What?
I can´t do it!
Come with me, Happy.
Come on!
You suck, you stupid clown!
Remember, this isn´t hockey.
You don´t play with raw emotion.
You can´t putt angry.
You must clear your mind of everything else and stay focused.
How can I do that?
Think of a place that´s reaIly perfect.
Your own happy place.
Go there and aII your anger wiII disappear.
Then putt.
Happy place.
Happy place.
Your happy place.
Now how do you feel?
Better.
Now putt.
Your happy place.
We took some giant steps tonight.
I´m reaIly proud of you.
Here.
I got something speciaI for you.
Thanks, Chubbs.
It´s the putter I used when I played -- slightly modified, of course.
Man, this is exceIlent.
You got the spirit of a hockey player in you, so I figured -- why fight it?
I got something for you, too.
If not for you, none of this would have happened...... so I wanted to show my appreciation.
This Iooks nice.
What is it?
Open it.
Shit.
Oh, man.
Remember the ´gator that got your hand?
I got his head.
First my dad and now Chubbs.
Anyone I get close to, dies.
If I were you, I´d run.
You can´t blame yourself for this.
I guess that aIligator finaIly finished the job.
I´m going to miss you, pal.
How am I going to play today?
Just remember what he taught you.
Congratulations, murderer.
You kiIled a golf Iegend.
Beat it, McGavin.
I´m dedicating my performance at the Tour Championship to Chubbs´ memory.
I´m playing for Chubbs.
I caIled it first.
You want to beat him?
Beat him on the course.
Yeah, I´m gonna beat your ass out there.
Right.
And Grizzly Adams had a beard.
Grizzly Adams did have a beard.
The golfers of the Tour Championship...... are ready to begin.
There may be 63 professionals...... vying for the title of world´s best... but in the minds of the spectators, there are only two.
Tour kingpin Shooter McGavin...... and bad boy Happy Gilmore, just off suspension.
Wouldn´t you know it?
They´ve been paired together.
I have some good interior design ideas for Grandma´s house.
You know the bedroom next to the stairs?
Yeah, that was my room.
I´m turning it into my trophy room.
It just may not be big enough.
AII right.
You know what´s pathetic?
You´ve been playing golf aII your Iife.
Let me show you how we do it in the pros.
That´s got to hurt.
Uh- oh.
Here´s a free Iesson.
Can´t Iearn that on a hockey rink.
Somebody´s closer.
After one day, Shooter McGavin is Ieading.
But the big surprise is young Happy Gilmore...... nipping at his heels, trailing by only one stroke.
Shooter from the sand.
Playing Iike he reaIly wants that jacket.
Happy Gilmore answers back with a birdie.
Happy with a Iong eagle opportunity.
It´s good!
And Shooter can´t believe it!
He is now tied with Happy Gilmore!
A Iittle too much zip on that one.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
No!
I didn´t see that.
Did it go in?
I wasn´t watching.
I saw it go up.
Did it go back in?
At the end of day three, Happy Gilmore has the Iead.
One has to be impressed with the vast improvement in his short game.
Donald, it´s Shooter.
Shooter!
It´s great to hear from you!
Want to go to Sizzler and get some grub?
Not hungry.
This caII is about business.
I need you here in the morning.
It´s the finaI day of the Tour Championship...... and it promises to be a classic.
Happy Gilmore Ieads the pack.
Is this a changing of the guard?
We´II know in 18 holes.
Happy is reaIly on today.
There he is.
That worm.
Happy, Iook out!
Are you okay?
Volkswagen.
Jackass!
Jackass!
You have no serious injuries.
Just keep off your feet for a few days.
Forget it.
I have to finish.
Do what you Iike.
What do I know?
I´m just a doctor.
- Are you okay?
- I´m fine.
There is no shame in throwing in the towel.
You must be carefuI with your health.
Let´s just play some golf.
I knew Happy Gilmore was tough...... but I can´t believe he´s playing after being hit by a car.
Let´s hope it doesn´t affect his game.
That´s the first time he´s failed to outdrive McGavin.
WeIl, weIl, weIl.
Happy Gilmore is human after aIl.
Happy Gilmore is in trouble if he can´t hit the Iong baIl.
If he has a chance...... of winning today, he must do it on the green.
He has to save this one for par.
That bogey drops him out of the Iead.
If he wants to stay in this thing...... he has to calm down.
Don´t worry about your grandma.
She can Iive with me -- be my maid.
Look at the cabbage he´s in now.
Things just keep getting worse for Happy Gilmore.
Just remember what Chubbs said.
"Go to a happy place."
"Go to a happy place."
God!
This Iooks Iike the end for Happy Gilmore.
Shooter now has a commanding Iead.
Happy, Iook who´s here.
Grandma.
Happy, you Iook upset.
What´s wrong?
I stink.
I´m not going to win.
Don´t worry, sweetheart.
The house isn´t important.
It´s just a house.
Stop fraternizing with the help, Gilmore.
Just hit your baIl, if you can find it.
Hi, Grandma.
Forget him.
I just want you to be happy, darling.
AII right, Grandma.
Grandma wants me to be happy.
Chin up, Happy.
Don´t feeI bad about me.
I got my hand back, see?
It ain´t over yet, McGavin.
The way I see it, we´ve only just begun.
Happy, the gold jacket´s yours.
Shooter wiII choke.
Unbelievable!
Damn you people!
This is golf, not a rock concert!
Happy...... rules!
Happy Gilmore has charged in the back nine...... and is now even with Shooter McGavin.
If Shooter doesn´t get out of the funk he´s in...... he may miss out on the gold jacket.
Ladies and gentlemen, the 18th hole is a par three, 160 yards.
In the event of a tie, there wiII be a play- off.
Mr. Gilmore, you have the honors.
No matter what, I´m having fun.
You´re starting to sound Iike a golfer.
I know.
Keep it down.
Nice shot!
Fifteen feet short of the hole.
Shooter´s baII is in the woods.
Happy´s on the 18th green, where a car driven by a crazed fan...... rammed the TV tower.
Let me through -- I´m Iooking for my baIl.
This is golf, okay?
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Is this your baIl?
Yes, it is.
It struck my foot.
Doug!
Do I get a drop?
The rule says, "Play it as it Iies."
That´s two so far, Shooter.
You can count.
Good for you.
And you can count on me waiting for you in the parking Iot.
You´re stiII away.
Thank you.
I can´t see.
Hey, up here.
Shooter needs this to put pressure on Happy.
If he misses, Happy can two- putt to victory.
Choke on that, baby!
Shooter.
If Gilmore sinks this, it wiII cap an amazing comeback.
Great.
Now I have a tower blocking my baIl.
We´II get it moved and you´II finish tomorrow.
Right, Doug?
"Play it as it Iies."
I hit it off Frankenstein´s fat foot.
Those are the rules.
He´s right.
Take your shot, Mr. Gilmore.
Virginia, just so you know, my jacket size is 44 Iong.
And my right arm is a bit Ionger than my Ieft.
Hit it around the tower, sink your putt and we´II go to sudden death.
Nah, I´II just beat him now.
Good Iuck.
Chubbs, I know you´II help me here.
Oh, my God.
Incredible!
Happy Gilmore wins the gold jacket.
I love you.
I love you.
And I love you.
Doug!
It´s impossible!
That´s my jacket!
It´s mine!
He stole my jacket!
I believe that´s Mr. Gilmore´s.
I wiII get you, Shooter!
Stop!
Stop!
Don´t!!!
- Coming?
- You bet.
AII right.
Here´s to Chubbs, wherever he is.
Hey, Happy.
Nice jacket.
Who are you waving at, Happy?
Let´s go home.
I' m just going to get some flowers, dear.
It' s tulip season today and I' m so happy.
- Son of a bitch.
- Come on, sweetie.
Come on, sweetie.
Come on now, sweetheart.
Go for a little ride, then you can whiz all over the city.
Come on, go for a ride.
No!
Freeze!
Leg down!
Leg down!
Come on.
You monkey- eared son of a...
You have pissed your last floor.
I' il bet you wish you were a real...
You dog- eared monkey.
If you can make it here you can make it anywhere.
Verdell?
Verdell?
Where' s my good doggie?
Verdell?
Come here, sweetheart.
Mr. Udall?
- Have you seen Verdell?
- What does he look like?
My dog.
You know...
My dog with the adorable face.
- Don' t you know what it looks like?
- You were talking about your dog.
I thought it was that coloured man.
Which colour was that?
Thick molasses with a broad nose.
- Frank!
- You have got to get dressed.
- Frank Sachs.
Melvin Udall.
I think you know that.
As long as you keep your work zipped up, around me, -
- I don' t care where you shove your show.
Are we done being neighbours?
- Let me...
- No!
Not worth it.
- Hope you find him.
Love that dog.
- You don' t love anything.
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four, five.
Hot.
Hot, hot, hot.
- Where is he?
- He had a thing with the dog.
- Ugly dog.
- He' s adorable.
My honey.
Where have you been?
Look at my boy.
- I found him, Mr. Bishop.
- We know you did.
Where was my baby?
ln the basement garbage bin eating diaper shit.
- You earned your fun, John.
- It just struck me as funny.
How did he get down there?
Even if he got in the elevator...
Maybe some nice neighbour shoved him down the garbage chute.
"ln the dark she had confessed and he had forgiven."
"This is what you live for, he said."
All is approval. "
"There is only the safety of being with each other."
"How could she find such hope in the most shameful part of her?"
- "She was able to define love."
"Love was..."
Mr. Udall, I' d like to speak to you.
Let me do this by myself.
- "Love was..."
- Are you in there?
Pansy- assed stool- pusher!
Yes?
This can wait.
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
That' s a load off.
Did you... do something to him?
Do you realize that I work at home?
Do you like being interrupted when you' re playing in your garden?
No, I turn the ringer off on my phone.
- And put a piece of cardboard...
- I work all the time.
So never interrupt me!
Not if you hear the sound of a thud from my home, -
- and one week later there' s a smell from a decaying human body, -
- and you have to hold a hanky to your face because of the stench.
Even then, don' t come knocking.
Or if it' s election night and you want to celebrate, -
- because some fudge- packer was elected the first queer president.
And he' s going to have you down to Camp David, -
- and you want someone to share the moment with.
Even then, don' t knock.
Not on this door.
Not for any reason.
Do you get me, sweetheart?
Yes.
It' s not a subtle point that you are making.
Okay, then.
So, now he will think twice before messing with me.
"Love was..."
What was love?
"Love was..."
Now I' m really pissed!
Don' t touch!
You don' t intimidate me with your attitude.
I grew up in hell, homeboy.
My grandmother had more attitude.
Police!
Help me!
And you' re black!
I like Simon enough to batter you unrecognizable, -
- if you verbally abuse him or touch that dog again.
I' il think of some way that you can make it up to him.
I hate doing this!
I' m an art dealer.
Have a nice day.
Party!
- Don' t touch.
- Get a life.
Watch it.
You' re better.
- New medication.
You know all my son' s stuff?
I' ve got a date tonight.
I' m walking out the door, he says, "I promise not to get a cough."
- lsn' t that sweet?
- A little blond angel.
I said, "You love me the way you love your remote control."
That' s great.
People that talk in metaphors ought to shampoo my crotch.
- Eat up!
- I' ve got your money.
- Pay me next week.
- I owe you and I told you today.
Excuse me, Melvin.
There you go.
Pardon me.
Take the money.
- Take a cab home and get ready.
- Ready is not my problem.
- I' m starving.
- You' re not allowed back here.
Spence is more excited about it than I am.
Sometimes, these kids, you just want to...
- I' ve got jews at my table.
- It' s not your table.
You can sit at someone else' s station.
Or you can wait your turn.
How much more have you got to eat?
Appetites aren' t as big as your noses, huh?
That' s it!
Let' s go.
He' s barred for life.
- They left.
- Yeah, what do you know?
Bryan says, if you ever act like this again you are barred for life.
I' m going to miss the excitement.
Three eggs, over easy.
- Sausage, bacon, fries.
- Fries today?
Coffee with cream and sweetener.
You' il die soon, with that diet.
We' re all gonna die.
You and I are, and it sounds like your son will.
If you ever mention my son again...... you will never be able to eat here again.
Give me some sign you understand, or leave now.
Do you understand me, you crazy fuck?
Do you?
Yes...
I' il get your order.
Wear my earrings tonight.
You said it like it was nothing.
- Where' s the bedroom?
- This is sort of it...
I sort of sleep in here.
Don' t worry about it.
What?
I don' t know.
Grandma...
- Maybe you better check.
- What did you think I was going to?
I' m sorry.
I was hearing everything...
I put these on to give you privacy.
How was dinner?
- Are you okay?
Scootch over.
- Where did he take you to eat?
- A nice place.
I have him...
- One more spit?
- He' s waiting.
Go.
- Give me a hug.
- Carol.
- Carol, I have him.
Go.
Close the curtains.
He can' t take smoke.
Magic.
That' il teach you.
I don' t even notice it any more.
Come here.
- It' s a little bit of throw- up.
- "Little bit of throw- up"?
What shall we do?
Shall I write down which train you take, or should we lay...
I' il take a cab.
It' s just a little too much reality for a Friday night.
I promised Simon I' d find him a model.
Take me offthe speaker.
These are house seats.
You could use a break.
Hello?
Carl?
You there?
Okay.
I just found a model.
- Hey, boys!
- I know this guy.
What' s going on?
Remember?
- I only need one.
You picked me up some time ago.
- This is for a portrait.
- Portrait?
I' il give you the address.
It' s the shit.
- Do you read?
Who is it, baby?
Who is it, Verdell?
I told you today.
I was out in the studio and I...
It' s out here.
- You have great things.
Great, isn' t he?
I make a big deal about picking models, but Carl is so thorough.
I bet he drove you nuts checking your résumé.
This is not a nude.
Just kidding around.
So much for love.
And yet another pose.
- What is your previous experience?
- I' m running out of ideas here.
- Give me some direction.
- I just watch.
Do anything you think of.
Wait until I say to hold that pose, then just try to hold it.
No direction.
What I do is, I watch.
Ever watch somebody who doesn' t know you' re watching them?
Or kids going to school?
Somebody just waiting, and you see this flash come over them.
And you know it has nothing to do with anything external.
They' re just sort of realer and more alive.
You look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
I know exactly what you mean.
Oh, my God...
Hold it.
Look out.
Excuse me.
I got on the third line of dialogue.
And all of a sudden I blanked.
Clippity- clop. lgnores me.
- So he said to me, "Last chance."
- Last chance.
- I came back in.
- Here she comes to ignore me again.
I messed up the same line.
But guess what?
He cast me!
Another actress.
Can' t live without me?
I' m finally going to ask.
What' s with the plastic picnicware?
Are you afraid ours isn' t clean?
- It' s a judgment call.
- Give yourself a pep talk.
"Must try other people' s clean silverware when dining out."
- What' s wrong with your son?
- What do you care?
He fights to breathe.
His asthma can shoot off the charts.
His immune system fails when there' s trouble, so an ear infection...
- ls this bothering you?
An ear infection, anything, sends him to the emergency room, -
- where I get some nine- year- old they just made a doctor.
Nice chatting.
- His name?
- Spencer.
Spence.
It' s okay.
Go on.
Put on anything you want.
- I might be sort of done here.
- All we do is work.
Let' s play!
- So you' re practically finished?
There is one more stage.
- Where are you going?
Just to sneak a peek.
- Verdell, you want some chocolate?
- He' s not allowed.
Wait!
I got to take off.
Do you want to say goodbye?
He' s just got to go.
- Wait.
I' m going to look at the painting.
Where are you going?
Want some water?
What' s the matter?
You want some water?
Simon, wait!
Why are you doing this?
No, wait...
- That painting in there...
- Are you cruising him?
Excuse me...
- Help me!
- Come on!
Come on.
You call 91 1 and don' t leave your name?
- Even a dumb geezer knows...
No one was killed.
Ask him.
I didn' t name you.
We will.
And if he can' t, we' il come back and ask you.
I come from hell.
My grandma has got more attitude than you.
Go shake down a 7- 1 1 for a day- old wiener.
There' s a painting of one of the guys.
- I' ve been praying for him.
- I' m on my way to the hospital.
- Just watch the dog for tonight.
- No, no.
- I' m sorry.
- Thanks.
Old bitch.
Damn dog.
You' re taking him!
Get out of the way!
Even the books.
Wait!
Do you want to say no to me?
I don' t want to say nothing to you.
Because I' ve never felt this crazy.
I almost want you to say no.
Thanks for looking after him.
- Hey!
Where are you going?
- You don' t want to mess with me.
I can' t take a dog.
Nobody' s been in here before.
Hey, Frank.
One, two, three, four...
You' re dead.
We don' t have no dog food here.
You' il eat what we got.
What we eat.
Don' t you do anything!
Where' s the trust?
Never a break.
God!
We' re halfway through the show and we haven' t sold a painting.
No, we can' t reduce the price.
- I' m in a free fall here.
- We can see him.
I' il meet you in there, okay?
Thank you.
- How are you doing, great one?
- I haven' t looked at myself yet.
I figured I could tell from your reaction.
- That bad?
- I talked to the doctor and...
It' s not that bad.
The doctors say you' il be your old self again.
The scars might...
Oh, shit!
Jackie...
Hand me a mirror, please.
Wait.
I have a smaller one.
So how are things, anyway?
- How is Verdell?
- Mr. Udall... taking care of him.
- How could you?
He' il hurt him.
- No, I promise.
I own this guy.
Besides, there was nobody else.
I' m always on the move and...
Trust me.
- You are certain my dog is okay?
- Yes, your dog is fine.
Waiting gives the devil time.
Oh, my!
Where did I go?
- That' s your dog?
- No.
What are you doing with a dog?
- Suckered in, set up.
- You' re not worried he' il be taken?
No, not until now.
- Sorry.
- I' m going to sit here.
Hey, puppy.
It' s so cute.
I wonder what breed he is.
If Bryan' s not here, you can bring him in.
How old are you?
To guess by your eyes... 50.
By your eyes, I' d say you were kind.
So much for eyes.
How old are you?
You brought it up.
I' m curious.
- Not that you' re ugly.
- I can take the compliment.
But my knees start knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
What' s with the dark?
Dawn patrol.
My son had a full- blown attack.
And for extra fun they gave us the wrong antibiotics.
No!
It' s bacon for the dog.
Last week I was playing the piano for him.
And he likes it.
So I decide I' m going to make a little joke.
It' s a beautiful day for our walk.
Look at that dog.
I' ve got to give you something real good.
I' m going to show it to you.
Don' t be like me.
You' re perfect.
I' il get you something to eat.
I' d like to be treated like that.
Let' s go home and do some writing.
"He had made the girl happy.
And what a girl. "
"You' ve saved my life, she said."
"You' d better make it up to me."
Done!
Yes, I hate the doggie.
62 books.
Done.
- We have to cut back all expenses.
- He has no medical insurance?
These are the food receipts, the household expenses.
- Here' s one for the dog again.
And all the laundry.
Boy, look at that.
He likes it at Chez Melvin.
What are you coming over here for?
I can' t cook with a dog near me.
Just sit.
We don' t want any company.
I' il read you Emerson.
- How' s Verdell doing?
- He' s a pain in the ass.
Simon' s home.
Can you keep the dog until he' s had a chance to adjust?
A few more won' t matter.
He wants him back right away.
He' il be by tomorrow.
Okay.
Be right with you.
Mr. Udall.
You look like...
Could you take it...... just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
Thank you.
Verdell.
Come here, my beautiful boy.
Let' s go home and get well.
I can' t blame him for being weird.
Look at yourself in the mirror.
Thank you.
Come on, sweetheart.
Verdell, come here.
I know what you want.
Where' s my boy?
No, don' t force him.
Over a dog!
Over an ugly dog.
Worst sidewalk in New York.
Look where they put it.
- Help!
- You' il make an appointment.
How can you diagnose someone as an obsessive- compulsive disorder -
- and then act like I had a choice about barging in?
- You must leave.
- You said you could help me.
A tease?
- If you take responsibility...
- You changed the room around.
- Two years ago.
I also grew a beard, but you' re not interested in changes in me.
I have to get to my restaurant.
Do you know how hard it was for me to come here?
No, we' re not doing this now.
I changed just one pattern, as you always said I should.
Nope.
What if this is as good as it gets?
What the heck are those for?
No, no, no.
Get Carol.
I' m filling in.
She might be getting a job closer to home.
- Why plastic?
- What are you trying to do to me?
- What do you mean?
- Look, elephant girl.
Go get Carol or something.
Just have her do my one meal here.
I' il pay whatever you want.
Do it!
Code blue.
Out!
Just shut up and get out.
I' il be quiet.
Just let me stay here.
No problem.
Go get Carol.
You are.
I' m not judging.
This day has been a disaster.
- I' m not sure if I can handle this.
- Get out!
Get out immediately or there' s going to be trouble.
See you.
It' s about time.
- Carol' s last name?
- Connelly.
- Not really.
Not any more.
I' m hungry.
I haven' t eaten.
- What are you doing here?
- This is not a sexist thing...
This is my home.
I' m trying to keep emotion aside, even though it' s important.
- I have strong feelings on this.
- What?
That I wasn' t there?
Do you have any control over how creepy you get?
Yes, I do.
I have not gotten personal, and you have.
Why aren' t you at work?
Are you sick?
You don' t look sick.
Just tired and bitter.
My son is sick.
What about your mother?
- How do you know about her?
- I hear you talking while I wait.
- Mom, I finished my juice.
- One sec.
How are you doing?
You should answer me.
Sorry, Melvin.
I can' t handle you teaching my son manners.
Back to life.
What' s wrong?
Five one- thousand, four one- thousand...
- 104. 9.
- We' re going on a cab ride.
Look out, you guys!
Look out.
We' re okay.
Melvin!
Wait!
Wait!
Shut up, kids!
Give us a lift, would you?
Cover your mouth when you cough.
- Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital.
- Hospital?
- Any chance you' il be back today?
Stay away from me.
We can' t put this off any longer.
I feel terrible that I have to...
Could you just leave the dog for a second?
Sorry.
- What are those cards?
- Frank thought I should have notes.
So I would maintain focus and not terrify you.
He' s right.
I need the cards.
SlMON, YOU' RE BROKE
The medical bills are 61, 000 now.
And the show didn' t go well.
I spoke to your parents.
They didn' t hang up or anything.
But they' d feel strange calling you.
I can' t call them.
Come here, baby.
Come here.
What' s wrong?
You miss the tough guy?
Well, here I am.
Happy to see me, you little mop?
How about a ride down the chute?
I' m sorry.
I didn' t mean that.
I didn' t mean that, sweetheart.
Sorry...
I' il be able to keep my apartment and the studio, won' t I?
Oh, my God!
But it' s more appropriate...
I need this.
Just say, "Melvin, I' il try."
- Melvin, I' il try.
- Thank you.
My son just got accepted to Brown.
My husband was dying.
Good, nice, thrilled, exciting.
You don' t have to wait with me.
I can' t resist.
I just have so many questions I want to ask you.
You have no idea what your work means to me.
What does it mean to you?
That somebody out there knows what it' s like to be in here.
God, this is like a nightmare.
Come on.
Just a couple of questions.
- How do you write women so well?
- I think of a man.
And I take away reason and accountability.
- Mom!
- ln here, Mrs. Connelly.
- Please, what?
- I' m...
- Tell me!
- Dr. Bettes.
Where is he?
- He' s in the bathroom.
What' s wrong?
You know there are doctors that come to your house?
I' m home.
I didn' t know you had an admirer.
Oh, you met the gift.
He' s good.
I' m an expert on doctors.
Okay, doctor?
My wife is Melvin Udall' s publisher.
I' m to take care of this little guy because you are needed at work.
- What kind of work do you do?
- I' m a waitress.
- ln Manhattan.
- Dr. Bettes?
Excuse me.
- I' m sorry it took so long.
- I couldn' t find it, either.
I want it back today.
- Did you say "today"?
- Yes.
Let' s sit down.
These are the receipts from all the prescriptions for the year.
- The calendar.
- This is a calendar of days.
- And how he felt.
- Good.
- How long has he had the problem?
Six months old.
Have they done blood tests?
- When he was well?
- No.
- And how about skin testing?
- No standard scratch test?
- No.
Why?
Should they have?
Fucking HMO bastard pieces of shit!
- I' m sorry.
- That' s their technical name.
Once the tests come back, is there someone we should talk to?
Me.
My home number is on the card.
His home number.
- What?
- Your home...
- Can we get you anything else?
- No, thank you.
Couple of female slaves?
There' s still a lot of tests I need to do.
Whatever I find out, I promise you, -
- from now on your son is going to feel a great deal better.
Doc!
That' s good.
One way or another we' il...
The costs are going to be considerable.
But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
That' s wonderful.
Thank you for everything, Nora.
Forgive my crankiness.
I' il call when things get back on track.
- What' s wrong?
- Who' s going to walk Verdell?
No!
- ls he dead yet?
- No.
Would there be any way you would be willing to walk his dog for him?
- Absolutely.
- You' re a wonderful man.
Two o' clock would be a good time.
Here is the key in case he' s asleep.
Open his curtains for him so he can see God' s beautiful work.
And he' il know that even things like this happen for the best.
Did you learn to talk like this in a "Sailor, wanna hump- hump" - bar?
Or is this your last shot at his whisky?
Sell crazy someplace else.
We' re all stocked up here.
No!
You can' t block out that man.
Do you really want to go back to emergency, where they can' t help?
This lets a crazy man into our lives.
You know how this will turn out.
You don' t send this one back.
Right?
Listen.
I have to go, okay?
FRlENDS TO ASK FOR MONEY
Bye.
Bye- bye.
What a day...
Maybe I' il bring him some food by.
Thank you for walking him.
- Excuse me, I' m not feeling well.
- This place smells like shit.
Go away.
- This cleaning lady doesn' t..?
- Please, just leave.
- What happened to your friends?
- Get out of here!
There' s nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you.
Nellie.
- Rot in hell, Melvin.
- No need to stop being a lady.
You' il be back on your knees in no time.
ls this fun for you?
It keeps getting better and better.
I' m losing my apartment, Melvin.
Frank wants me to beg my parents, who haven' t called me, for help.
And I won' t.
I don' t want to paint any more.
The life I was trying for, is over.
The life I had is gone and I' m feeling sorry for myself.
It' s high times for you, isn' t it?
The gay neighbour is terrified.
Terrified!
I was trying to give you a boost.
You' re here for rock bottom.
You absolute horror of a human being.
The one thing I' il do for you might cheer you up.
Get out.
You want to know why the dog prefers me?
It' s not affection.
It' s a trick.
I keep bacon in my pocket.
See?
It' s a trick.
Come here, Verdell.
Come on.
Come here.
Just a stupid dog.
Could you leave now?
Please?
I don' t get it.
Mr. Udall!
- Carol the waitress?
- Yes.
I' m sorry about the hour.
If you...
Though it' s nice to talk to a real doctor about Spencer.
Note.
Put it in a note.
- I have a hairdryer.
- Why did you do this for me?
- So you' d come back to work.
- That sounds strange.
I' m worried you did this...
Are you waiting for me to say something?
- I need to clear this up now.
Clear what up?
I' m not going to sleep with you.
I will never sleep with you.
Not ever!
I' m sorry, but...... we don' t open for the no- sex oaths until 9 a. m.
- I' m not kidding.
- Anything else?
Just... thank you.
So you will be at work tomorrow?
Yes.
"Never", she said.
I took a chance you were up.
I brought you some Chinese soup.
Thanks.
I' ve never been this tired in my life.
I haven' t been sleeping.
I haven' t been clear in my head or felt like myself.
I' m in trouble.
It' s not just the tiredness.
Nauseous.
- Sleepy.
Everything looks distorted and everything inside aches.
You can barely find the will to complain.
I' m glad we did this.
Good talking to you.
- Still writing that thank- you note?
- How do you spell "conscience"?
C- O- N- S- C- I- E- N- C- E.
Look, I got Sean to babysit so we could go out.
I don' t feel safe leaving Spencer with someone.
Spencer' s okay.
Start finding something to do with your free time.
Sean, are you hungry?
We got pizza.
You want to make this later?
We are going out, like people do.
If you can' t feel good about this break and step out a little, -
- then you ought to have Mr. Udall send you over a psychiatrist.
I don' t need one.
I know what' s going on here.
I must finish this letter first.
Con- science?
Carol!
What?
It' s very weird not feeling that...... stupid panic thing inside me.
Without that, I start thinking about myself.
And what good does that ever get anybody?
Today on the bus there was this adorable couple.
And I felt myself...... giving them a dirty look.
Everything was...
Go ahead.
Moving in the wrong direction.
Away from a time when I remembered what it was like to have a man...... to hold fucking...
... hands with.
I felt almost really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.
Which is probably why I make Spence hug me more than he wants to.
He has to make up for his Mom not getting any.
- Who needs these thoughts?
- So, are you frustrated?
Leave me be.
What is it you want?
Does getting me thinking about all that' s wrong have some purpose?
Really, Mom, what is it you want?
- What?
- I want us to go out.
- Thank you.
- I' il send you a thank- you note.
That' s why you brought me here?
That' s why you brought me here?
Well, it' s not even mine.
Simon has enough on his mind.
But the dog did throw up twice last night.
- Take him to the vet.
- I did.
His stomach' s out of whack.
- They need him a couple of days.
- Well, do it...
Sorry.
- This is for later.
- What' s this?
- It' s a note.
- A note?
- A thank- you note.
- No thank you.
- You can read it later.
No, no.
Thank you.
- She' s nice.
- Yeah, really nice.
Shouldn' t that be a good thing, saying, "No thanks required"?
Sure looks like it went over, too.
Look at you.
You' re making the rounds.
Simon says you brought him soup.
- What?
- You think I' m a mark...
You helped with the dog.
I' m as concerned about Simon as you are.
- Concerned?
- He needs more than money.
He must go to Baltimore to ask his parents for money tomorrow.
They have to help.
It' s the rules.
That' s great.
Let them help him.
I got a painter coming through, so I' m out.
- Can you drive him?
- Think white and get serious!
A convertible.
- Do you drive?
- Yes.
But I' m not doing it.
Getting loud.
- I want your problems.
Somebody offers me a convertible so I can get out of this city...
- Okay.
I' il do it.
I' il take him.
Get him packed.
Tomorrow morning I' il take him.
I' il see you tomorrow.
Let' s not drag this out.
If there' s some health foundation for people like you, let me know.
- Last- word freak.
- Good luck, lady.
- Anything else?
- Yeah.
I' m going to give my queer neighbour a lift to Baltimore.
It' s working out?
What you did changed my life.
No!
No thank- you note.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life -
- is that you have done more for my mother, my son...... and me than anybody else ever has.
I' m just going to read you this part of it
"That makes you the most generous person I ever met in my life."
"And you' re going to be in our daily prayers, forever."
Lovely.
I wrote that I was sorry.
- when you told my son that he ought to answer back.
I wrote that I was sorry about that.
I' m sorry for that night...... when I said that I was never...
I' m sorry for every time your food was cold and you had to wait.
And I' m sorry for never spotting the human being that did this for us.
I' il just start from the beginning.
"I have not been able to express my gratefulness to you."
"The word grateful doesn' t begin to tell you what I feel."
That' s nice of you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now I want you to do something for me.
I' m sorry.
I thought I did.
- What?
- I want you to go on this trip.
- No, sir.
- I can' t do this without you.
He might pull the stiff one- eye on me.
I need you to chaperone.
Now I' m on the hook.
Two days.
My son.
- Bettes said he' s doing fine.
- Melvin, I' d rather not.
- Write a note.
Ain' t she sweet?
- I need a hand and where is she?
- Your help obligates me?
ls there any other way to see it?
No.
Shocked that it' s being used.
There' s no way to pack for this trip.
- You' re still coming, aren' t you?
- Yes.
Melvin, exactly where are we going?
Just south of Baltimore.
I know what you' re going to say.
I think I know.
- I' m not sure, but I think so.
- Should I bring something dressy?
Will we be eating in restaurants that have dress codes?
Maybe...
- Yes.
Let' s.
- Okay.
- What did you think I' d ask?
- Whether crabs were in season now.
Okay, then.
Goodnight.
- Anything unusual in his diet?
- No.
Everybody gets their own cage?
Put him in with that one.
Lip kiss.
I love you.
I' il miss you...
Real sensitive.
- Bye.
- Call when you' re settled.
- Have a good time.
- Don' t run!
Have fun, but don' t run.
- I' m sorry I' m not taking you.
- So am I, Frank.
Give me a hug.
Everything' s going to be okay.
Soak it up.
It' s your last chance for a hug for a few days.
Hello.
Thank you for being on time.
Simon the fag.
Who did that to you?
I was attacked.
I walked in on some men robbing me.
And I was hospitalized.
- I almost died.
- Let' s do the small talk later.
- I was going to do that.
- Where should we sit?
- There' s no place cards.
- You need room.
So I' il sit in the back.
Never a break.
Never.
It was very thoughtful.
- You look like you' re crowded.
- It' s all right.
Thanks.
Thank you.
You' re welcome.
I' ve got the whole trip programmed.
I just wanted to see what you' d do.
TO USE AS lCEBREAKER
We' ve got good stuff here.
I like this music.
I like this music.
I' m sure they did something really off.
But something will always be off for you, unless you set it straight.
And maybe this thing happened to you to give you a chance to do that.
Nonsense.
You want to know why?
Anyone interested in what Melvin has to say, raise their hand.
Want to know what happened with my parents?
- When I was...
I' m going to pull over.
I always painted.
And my mom always encouraged me.
She was sort of fabulous about it.
I was too young to think there was anything wrong with it.
And she was very natural.
So she used to pose nude for me.
I always thought that my father knew about it.
- This stuff is pointless.
- Let him finish.
- Do you want to hear my sad story?
- Stop!
Go ahead.
Don' t let him stop you.
And he started screaming.
My father didn' t come out for 1 1 years.
He used to hit me with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
Go ahead, Simon.
So he came in and he was yelling?
Please, come on.
He was...
I was defending my mother.
I was trying to make peace in the lamest way.
It' s art. "
And he started hitting me.
He beat me unconscious.
And he talked to me less and less.
He knew what I was before I did.
The morning I left for college he walked into my room.
And it was filled with money.
A big sweaty wad of money.
And he said, "I don' t want you to ever come back."
I just grabbed him and I hugged him.
And he turned and walked out.
- We all have these stories.
- It' s not true.
Some of us have great stories.
That take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad.
But a lot of people.
That' s their story...
It' s not that you had it bad, -
- but that you' re that pissed that so many others had it good.
I don' t think so.
- Not it at all, really.
Not it at all?
Let' s go to the hotel.
You' il see if you can get another wad of sweaty money out of his hand.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Sure.
You ever get an erection over a woman?
- Wouldn' t your life be easier..?
- You consider your life easy?
I give you that one.
Nice packing.
- Hey, Spence.
Wait till you hear...
- Why are you out of breath?
- Mom, lscored a goal.
- You did?
Charlie.
That' s great.
Oh my God!
Got to go.
- Wait...
- I don' t believe it.
You would have died.
My son was outside playing soccer.
- Take me out dancing.
- Dancing?
I' m exhausted.
- Oh, come on.
No.
All right.
- Are you sad or something?
I' m nervous.
It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren' t along.
I' m happy.
And you' re my date.
Let' s get dressed.
I' il be right with you.
All set?
- Do you sell hard- shell crabs?
- Yes.
- Do they sell hard- shells?
- Yes.
- Do they sell hard- shells?
- Yes.
Good evening.
- You have hard- shells, right?
- Stop asking.
- You can answer.
- Yes, we do.
- I can give you a tie and jacket.
- What?
They require a tie and jacket.
And I won' t let you inject me with plague.
It' s a nice place.
You dry- clean these all the time, don' t you?
I don' t think so.
You just wait here.
Good evening.
- I need a coat and tie.
- Come on in.
- No?
- That one.
And this tie.
Excuse me.
She' s here.
We saved a table for you.
- Should I get her for you?
I' il just watch.
Ma' am...
You look so se...
You look great.
You look great.
You want to dance?
I' ve been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
No.
I don' t get this place.
They make me buy a new outfit and let you in in a housedress.
Wait.
Where are you going?
Why?
I didn' t mean it that way.
Sit down.
- Give me the dirty look.
- Pay me a compliment, Melvin.
I need one.
Quick.
What you just said hurt my feelings.
The minute someone gets that they need you they threaten to walk out.
A compliment is something nice about somebody else.
Now or never.
And mean it.
Can we order first?
Pitcher of cold beer.
- Baked or fries?
- Fries.
- Fries.
- One baked, one fried.
I' il tell your waiter.
I' ve got a great compliment for you.
And it' s true.
- I' m afraid it' s something awful.
- Don' t be pessimistic.
Here I go.
I' ve got this... ailment.
My doctor, a shrink I used to go to, -
- says that in 50 or 60 percent of the cases a pill really helps.
I hate pills.
Very dangerous thing.
I' m using the word "hate" here about pills.
My compliment is, the night you came over and told me you would never...
All right, you know what you said.
My compliment to you is, -
- the next morning I started taking the pills.
How is that a compliment for me?
You make me want to be a better man.
That' s maybe the best compliment of my life.
Maybe I overshot a bit to keep you from walking out.
How' s it going with those pills?
Good, I hope, I hope, I hope.
It' s little by little.
It' s exhausting talking like this.
Exhausting.
Do you ever let a romantic moment make you do something stupid?
Never.
Here' s the trouble with never.
- You don' t owe me that.
- That wasn' t payment.
When I first saw you I thought you were handsome.
Then, of course, you spoke.
So now that your... soft underbelly is all exposed...
Tell me, why did you bring me here?
Well, I...
- That' s a personal question.
- Tell me, even if you' re scared.
- Scared?
- Tell me why you wanted me here.
If you ask me, I' il say yes.
I...
There' s a lot of reasons.
- If you had sex with Simon...
- What?
- That' s just one idea.
- That' s why you brought me?
Like I' m a what..?
And I owe you what?
It was just one thought.
It came out first.
You kiss him... me...
You two seemed to hit it off.
Wait.
I didn' t mean...
Forget what I said about Simon.
- I' il never forget it.
- A mistake.
It was a mistake.
Hello, this is Fred Bishop.
We' re unable to take yourcall.
- Leave a message.
- Say goodbye... and thank you.
It' s Simon.
I' m in town.
You' ve never been out later than ten o' clock.
Pick up the phone.
Really.
I' m going to try you in the morning.
I need to see you.
Or at least get you to answer the phone.
How are you?
- ls this going to be your room?
I don' t want to see him.
- What happened?
- Don' t ask.
- Can you not be so violent?
- I don' t think so.
I' m taking a big bath.
Are you okay?
Don' t ask.
I' m tired of my complaints.
- What are you thinking about?
- How to die, mostly.
Can you believe, in our little mix you' re the good roommate?
Goodnight.
Hold it.
I have to draw you.
- No.
- I' m more shy than people think.
- I haven' t sketched in weeks.
Do a vase.
But you' re beautiful, Carol.
The line of you.
You' re why cavemen chiselled on walls.
Cut me a break.
The next thing I know she' s sitting next to me.
I got nervous.
I said the wrong thing.
Where, if I hadn' t, -
- I could be in bed now with a woman who...
If you make her laugh, you got a life.
lnstead, I' m here with you.
No offence, but a moron pushing the last legal drug.
Jameson, soda back.
We' re being naughty here, pal.
No, this is...
This is so great.
My hand won' t even keep up.
Hold it.
- I' m just turning.
- But hold that.
My hand' s not even bothering me.
I can' t get the angle with this cast.
Careful.
PRlVACY
I' m coming in.
It' s late.
- Did you have sex with her?
- Don' t you want your shampoos?
Sorry.
I didn' t know she was still here...
Did you have sex with her?
To hell with sex.
We held each other.
What I need, he gave me great.
I' il get dressed in a hurry.
I just love her.
How are you doing?
- Mom, hi.
- Hello, Simon.
- You were right We were home.
- Do you have to whisper?
- I' m nota screamer.
- It was lucky you didn' t answer.
- Yourfatheris not feeling well.
- I can' t hear you.
- What are you going to do?
- I get why you' re angry with me...
- He' s talking to his parents.
Truly no grudges.
It was odd that you didn' t come and see me when you heard I was hurt.
- We almost did.
- I don' t want to talk about it.
The important thing is that your son is happy.
- I' m working again.
Aboutmoney...
No.
It' s up to you to make the next move.
And they' il take a ride to the lake.
- Bye- bye.
- Goodbye, dear.
It' il give us a chance to...
- I' m coming.
- What about your parents?
I' il take care of myself.
- What are you talking about?
- You' ve got real problems.
I' m a little bit nervous.
Suddenly everything seems so easy.
Carol, a load has been lifted.
- One night wih me.
- You think you' re kidding.
- No choice.
- I' ve got a gift for you.
Let me see...
Gorgeous.
And get the dog picked up.
I can' t believe he let it stay there.
Goodbye.
Your luck' s running.
They sub- let your place.
You' re homeless.
- Frank' s got a line on a new place.
- Where?
Does it matter?
No, it doesn' t.
Like the hat?
I' m sorry.
FOR EMERGENCY USE ONLY
- I don' t want to hear that music.
- You said you liked it.
- This one has a meaning.
- I don' t want to hear it.
Here' s the keys to my apartment.
Go up there and wait and I' il take Carol home.
- I' il take a bus.
- No, I' il take you.
Can you come here?
- I don' t care what you did for me.
- What' s wrong?
I don' t want to know you any more.
All you do is make me feel bad.
You have my number.
- Don' t want to.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Don' t say anything.
I' ve got to get a hold of Frank and see where I' m hanging my hat.
I think you' re going to have to camp it here.
There' s Verdell!
Mommy and Daddy are home.
Sorry.
You' re fun to mess with.
They rented your place furnished.
Jackie said she' d bring your things.
It' s an extra room.
- It' s got good light.
- I' m coming.
Looks good.
They' ve even got your music, paintings, paints.
I have to say they did a good job.
It' s going to be okay.
Cosy, huh?
Thank you, Melvin.
You overwhelm me.
I love you.
I' d be the luckiest guy alive if that did it for me.
Make yourself at home.
Anything else in the bag?
But I was playing soccer while you were away.
I love my cookbook.
It' s got wonderful recipes.
It says something with a shark.
Would you like that, Spencer?
And some cookies here called Wasps' Nests.
Where is my big hairy boy?
Where is he?
Where is my beautiful boy?
Sweetheart!
- Oh, you' re in bed.
- No, no.
I just didn' t think Verdell should get too comfortable sleeping here.
The dog' s already comfortable.
ls this okay?
Hi, it' s me.
He took me in.
It' s Carol for you.
- Jackie brought it all over...
- Just take the dog.
Take the dog.
- Come on.
Move fast.
- Good luck.
- Howare you doing?
- Not so hot.
- Why?
- Was I sensible or hard on you?
- Maybe both.
- Are you being cute or crazy now?
- Cute.
- You don' t have to answer.
Just listen to me.
It' s really something that you' re looking after Simon.
And what I said on the street...
That was a bad thing to say.
It was a bad thing to say.
And I' d be lying if I didn' t say I enjoy your company.
But you do bother me.
And I know it' s better for me...... to not have contact with you because you' re not ready.
You' re an old guy to not be ready.
And I' m too old to ignore that.
But there were extraordinary kindnesses that did take place.
Thanks for the trip.
Goodnight.
Okay if I say something now?
Go ahead.
I should have danced with you.
Goodnight.
- Are you going to talk to me?
- I' m coming.
- What did she say?
- That I' m a great guy.
And she doesn' t want contact with me.
I' m dying here.
- Because... you love her.
- No.
And you people are supposed to be sensitive?
You' re the one who' s "dying here".
- Let me sleep on it.
- Oh, come on.
- I' il figure it out.
- Please...
I' m stuck.
I can' t get back to my old life.
- She' s evicted me from my life.
- Did you really like it that much?
It' s better than this.
If you' re going to give me hope, you' ve got to do better.
If you can' t be mildly interesting, then shut up.
And you' re describing the water.
Picking on me won' t help.
If that' s true, I' m really in trouble.
Do you know where you' re lucky?
You know who you want.
I would take your seat any day.
Do something.
Go over there.
Tonight.
It' s not always good to let things calm down.
You can do this, Melvin.
Tell her how you feel.
- I' m charged.
- Yes, you are.
- She might kill me if I go there.
I' il read you a story.
The best thing going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself.
Go over there.
Catch her off guard.
Thanks a lot.
Here I go.
What' s wrong?
I forgot to lock the door.
- What do you want?
- I' m sorry I woke you up.
I wasn' t asleep.
What a break.
ls it a secret what you' re doing here?
I had to see you.
Because?
It relaxes me.
I' d feel better sitting outside your apartment on the curb -
- than any other place I can think of or imagine.
That' s overstating.
I' d rather be sitting inside so I don' t get my feet in the gutter.
Stop.
Why?
A regular boyfriend who doesn' t go nuts on me.
It doesn' t exist.
I' m sorry.
I didn' t mean to interrupt.
Boyfriend...
Come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
Maybe we could live without the wisecracks?
Maybe we could.
It feels a little confined here.
Let' s take a walk.
It' s four in the morning.
A walk sounds a little screwy to me.
- If you don' t mind.
- Well, if you need an excuse...
There' s a bakery on the corner that' il be open soon.
That way we' re not screwy, but two people that like warm rolls.
- What are you doing?
- I want you to hear that song.
And darling I' m neverlonely wheneveryou' re in sight...
Thank you.
I was...
Whatever this is won' t work.
- I' m...
- What?
I' m feeling better.
It may seem that way now, but you don' t know me all that well.
I' m not the answer for you.
- I' ve got a compliment for you.
- You know what?
Let me talk.
I might be the only person on the earth -
- that knows you' re the greatest woman on earth.
I might be the only one who knows how amazing you are.
And how you are with Spencer.
Spence.
And in every single thought you have.
How you almost always mean something that' s about being straight or good.
Most people miss that about you.
I wonder how they can watch you bring their food and clear tables -
- and never get that they just met the greatest woman alive.
And the fact that I get it makes me feel good...... about me.
ls that something that it' s bad for you to be around?
No.
I' m going to grab you?
I didn' t mean for that to be a question.
I' m going to grab you.
I know I can do better than that.
Definitely better.
See?
- Want something?
- Warm rolls.
Excuse us.
Oh, baby, what I couldn' t do
With plenty of money and you
In spite of the worry that money brings
Just a little filthy lucre buys a lot of things
And I could take you to places you' d like to go
But outside of that I' ve no use for dough
It' s the root of all evil Of strife and upheaval
But I' m certain, honey that life could be sunny
- With plenty of money and you - May I help you?
I' m looking for a box of chocolates.
Something fancy, if you have it.
- Yeah.
I want something fancy... and not too rich because she tends to put on a little blubber, the wife.
- Around the thighs.
What about this one?
It' s really nice.
It' s kind of rich.
- It' s from Belgium.
- From Belgium?
- It' s very pretty.
- Yeah.
- Hey, Frenchy, I' m home!
- Who' s that?
"Who' s that?" It' s the pope!
- I always wanted to see your apartment.
Me.
- I' m watching Princess Diana.
Not again!
How many times you gonna do that?
Look at those clothes.
I told you time and again, she got all that stuff discount.
You think those kings and queens buy retail?
It' s a known --
- Here, I got you some chocolates.
- Chocolates?
You heard of chocolates?
I got you chocolates.
- How come?
- What do you mean, "How come?"
They' re handmade by "Belgiumites."
Tell it to the marines!
You' re up to something.
You get caught hitting on a waitress?
In 25 years of marriage, have I ever hit on anybody but you?
I don' t buy it, Ray.
You got a scheme!
Forget it!
They' re not for you.
- I got you nothing.
Just get me dinner.
- Fine.
I want my dinner right now, and hurry up.
Before you make dinner, I gotta talk to you about something.
What did I tell you?
Here comes the commercial.
- Frenchy, I need our 6, 000 bucks.
- What?
- I gotta have our six G' s.
- That' s our whole savings.
- Don' t get dramatic about it.
That' s all we got, right?
I' m gonna make us rich.
How you gonna make us rich?
How' d you guess that?
What?
First shot out of the box, you got it.
And Denny?
What would you say if I told you... that you were married to a very brilliant man?
- I' d say I' d have to be a bigamist.
- This is foolproof.
You told me you were finished with that life.
I kick around from stupid job to job.
- You like the way we' re living?
- It beats your former residence.
Think I like spending our anniversary staring at you through glass, talking over a phone?
Frenchy, you stood by me.
Granted, you stood by me.
Two years in the joint I waited for you.
And what did I get for it?
You got Belgian chocolates.
What' s wrong with that?
God, I' ve got an idea and this is so incredible.
We need 18, 000 bucks.
Denny' s kickin 'in six, Tommy' s kickin' in six, and I gotta put in my six.
- They' re not bums.
- Harvard?
They never completed kindergarten because they were drafted.
For God' s sakes!
Denny' s not stupid 'cause he drives a truck.
No, he' s stupid because he has a low I. Q. Come on, out of the way.
- Oh, yeah.
Tommy' s got street smarts.
- He is street smart.
His brain' s got potholes.
You with the wisecracks!
She' s got an answer for everything.
Forget it!
I got my end.
I told you I could match you.
He can' t get his end.
Frenchy, I' ve gotta have that money!
Pass.
Maybe if you needed a quadruple bypass.
- This is a brilliant thing!
- No, Ray really is a genius!
- Compared to you this chair is a genius.
This is precise, mathematical.
It' s hard to believe you' re just a dishwasher.
Thank you.
I don' t get your "agreeance" on this, I count to three, there' s gonna be trouble.
I did a lot of nails for that money, and it' s all we got.
Nails?
- Take a hike, okay?
- Oh, yeah?
- If I lose it, you' re gone.
- Oh, I' m quaking in my panty hose.
- You' re embarrassing me in front of my friends.
- I can' t have a cookie?
- What' s up?
- Did you get your share?
My share of what?
Yeah, I got it.
I sold some stuff.
- What' d you sell?
- A rented car.
- He can' t get his end.
She won' t give it to him.
- I can get my end!
The candy didn' t work?
You said you' d have her eatin 'out of your hand.
Will you shut up?
All that' s missing from this guy is a piece of velvet and a pet mouse.
Frenchy, gimme the money.
I wouldn' t invest our last six thou if you had a legit idea... much less something that' s gonna land the three of you jerks back in stir.
You said you called the shots around here.
Will you knock it off!
Frenchy, that money' s mine.
I earned it, and I' m saving it for an emergency.
- Oh, take a hike.
Frenchy, I' m gonna get violent!
Please!
With your hernia?
Fellas, I can' t do it.
Forget it.
You said you' re the boss.
Stop telling me what I said, for crying out loud!
It' s over.
Let someone else do it.
I' m going up on the roof.
- You' re too valuable as a dishwasher.
- Ah, knock it off!
- No!
I want one.
All right, tell me your idea.
You shot it down.
- You gonna tell me, or are you gonna have a tantrum?
For some reason you' re always shooting down my dreams.
Because you get the kind of dreams people get... after putting opium in their brownies.
Can I for one minute tell you about this bank?
You' re not a bank robber.
You got a two- year mandatory vacation that proved that.
That' s all we proved.
They were all Ronald Reagan masks.
I didn' t know who was who.
You' re lucky your lawyer knew the judge.
Can I please tell you my idea, Frenchy?
A little hole in the wall.
It' s for rent.
And, believe me, I' m no genius.
We take the pizza joint, tunnel under, we come up under the vault of the bank.
I know the layout 'cause I used to know a guard.
We clean out the vault, we go to Florida.
Ray, we' re poor but we' re happy, ain' t we?
We' re not happy.
You' re always complaining.
Are you happy doing cuticles?
Is that the way you want to spend your life?
She said, "Don' t get involved with a guy from the rackets."
We had dreams.
I don' t know what' s gotten into you.
- Did we not have dreams when I first met you?
Yes, granted, I was in the rackets.
We fell in love, your parents didn' t approve.
I couldn' t make a go of the pet cemetery.
What do you want me to do?
But, but --
Frenchy, this pizza place is just waiting for us.
It' s gonna look suspicious, a group of guys drilling in an empty store.
You front the place.
- What?
You make pizzas.
I can' t cook pizzas.
What' s the difference?
Or you tell fortunes.
Or make it a travel agency.
You work there, and we' il tunnel under into the bank.
- God.
- Frenchy, come here, come here.
- Yeah.
See what you' re seeing there?
It' s not just New Jersey.
Remember that?
Yeah.
In New Jersey.
But in Columbia there was an earthquake.
Sorry, but the location was taken by someone else.
What?
They made a deal yesterday.
I told you, if you waited too long --
Who did?
Who took the place?
Gimme -- You got the name?
Mrs. Nettie Goldberg.
Jesus!
For what?
I believe a flower shop.
A flower shop!
Her husband died, and she wants to make the joint into a flower shop.
Somebody' s got to get to her.
- To get to her and what?
Beg her, con her, trick her.
I' m gonna go to her shop and threaten her.
- You can' t threaten her.
That' s all we need -- - Don' t do that.
- And say what?
If her husband just died, what are you gonna say?
You need a plan.
Right.
I gotta figure something.
I' il charm her.
- What are you gonna use for charm?
- Knock it off.
We' re serious.
You don' t even have the lease.
That' s what this is about.
What a hoot.
- That' s very funny.
- I' m gonna slam your head off.
- Hey!
The bank isn' t even next to the pizza joint.
That' s what' s great about it.
Why?
'Cause there' s nothing suspicious.
The only thing suspicious is your sanity.
When did any of you guys dig a tunnel?
It' s no big deal.
You really underestimate Ray' s personality.
He' s one of the most likable dishwashers I' ve ever met.
We' re gonna proceed.
- Uh -- - Yeah?
I' m lookin 'for Nettie Goldberg.
- Who wants her?
- Uh, I got something for her.
I want to make her an offer.
A big offer.
Big dough!
Come on in.
- I' m Nettie Goldberg.
- I know you.
You' re Benny from cell block eight!
- Oh, God, Ray!
How are you?
- Ray!
- You' re lookin 'at me like I' m a stranger.
- Small world!
Come in.
Small world.
You took the lease on that empty store?
I' m gonna open a flower shop.
What' re you gonna do with a flower shop?
Burn it down.
Burn it down?
You' re still burning stuff down for insurance?
That' s how I sent two kids through college.
That' s crazy.
There' s no money in that.
Benny, you gotta come in with us.
- Who' s "us"?
- "Who' s us"?
What are you so suspicious for?
It' s me, Ray.
- Remember my nickname in the joint?
The Brain.
That' s what the guys used to call me.
But, Ray, that was sarcastic.
- That wasn' t sarcastic, that was real.
- No, it was sarcastic.
- There was nothing sarcastic about it!
- No, really, it was.
- It was real.
I was The Brain.
- No, it was sarcastic.
- It wasn' t sarcastic.
Oh, my God!
It was sarcastic!
- Fellas, this is Benny.
He' s in.
- Benny?
- How you doin '?
- Good.
- You know you' re workin 'with a genius?
I mean, we' re all smart, but he wears glasses.
- What' s good?
- Oak.
It' s the strongest.
- Yeah.
This looks good.
Look how long it is.
We could build a house with this.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Like a house.
- A house, yeah.
How much is that?
- A thousand bucks.
- A thousand bucks a box!
- How many sticks in a box?
- Fifty.
My God, this is robbery.
This is unbelievable.
What do we need all this dynamite for?
What do we need the dynamite for?
Just be careful --
- Ahh.
- Can I have one of these and one of these?
One of these?
- Mm- hmm.
- One of these.
You want a bag?
- No, that' s okay.
You' il take 'em like this?
- That' s fine.
But when it' s over, we' re gonna be all very well compensated.
- What do you mean?
I don' t know how to work a drill like that.
There' s nothing to that.
No, no.
What do you think this is?
We wrap this blanket around it, it' s fine.
- You gotta know how to work a drill like that.
Shut it off.
Will you guys shut up?
What did you do, tear a wall down?
- We ain' t started yet.
What are you waiting for, the drilling season?
Go upstairs and bake.
You know, l -- I don' t need any help.
- No.
You better brace me.
Guys!
What are you doing?
Come on, get that thing!
Get that thing!
You got it?
Okay, hold it.
Could we have a half dozen of the chocolate cinnamon?
We' re closed... for Easter.
- That was three months ago.
- Greek Easter.
- Chinese Easter!
We' re closed, okay?
Honey, what kind do you want?
All right!
Come on, have a cookie.
Sure, take a cookie.
- How you doin '?
- Oh, hi.
- You still open?
Sure.
- Give me two cherry cinnamon.
- Cherry cinnamon, right.
- New here, huh?
- Just opened today, yeah.
- What' s all that noise in the back?
Oh, that' s the, uh, cookie press.
Needs oil, you know.
- This is our plumber.
- I' m the plumber.
- How' s it goin '?
- What do I owe you?
- Oh, no charge.
Take it easy.
- I gotta get some sandbags.
The cookies, they' re 85 cents.
- Just relax.
You' re a perfect fit.
- Where the hell are the sandbags?
Okay, so we got off to a shaky start.
Yeah, I' d say it was shaky.
No question about it.
So what?
Tomorrow bring a bathing suit.
I' m not discouraged 'cause I don' t get discouraged.
You know, there was a woman on before.
She' s got over 200 pairs of shoes.
You' re gonna get yours, Frenchy.
I promise you.
It' il be great.
Doesn' t that sound great?
- Frenchy -- - Opening night at the opera.
Can I tell you this?
I love you.
'Cause you back me all the time, you stand by me.
You know when I first knew I loved you?
This was a long time ago.
And you got it.
You' re a very romantic man.
And I' m a lucky woman... because not many wives get to see their husbands... battling a ruptured water main.
- I' m crazy about you.
- Crazy about you, darling.
- Here, Benny.
- Go ahead, put it in the bag.
- I' il give it to you -- - He puts it in the bag!
- Right, so it don' t make no noise.
- This is efficiency.
- He puts it in the bag.
- It' s call efficiency, my friend.
- Teamwork.
- It saves energy.
I' il take a chocolate chip.
- The little girl was first.
What do you want?
Okay.
You can only have two.
- What are you stopping for?
- I' m trying to figure this out.
I think, according to this, we' re supposed to take a left turn.
That doesn' t mean stop.
Let' s go.
Will you give me -- What the hell are you doing?
- What do you mean?
- You' ve got your hat on backwards.
So?
"So?" The flashlight goes in the front.
It looks cooler like this.
Are you a jerk?
What do you mean it looks cooler?
It' s more stylish than that.
Look at that.
- You think so?
Turn it around.
This is chic like this.
Look at that.
That' s cool.
- You got a mirror?
- Look at yourself.
I' il show you when we get out.
- Can you keep going?
I' m trying to figure the map out!
One?
Two?
Okay, everybody, hold on.
Thank you very much.
- Thank you, thank you.
Okay, yeah.
What are you guys gonna do with your share?
How much is my share?
I' m countin 'the jewelry in there too.
Then divided four ways, that' s a half million bucks apiece.
- What about Frenchy?
- What about Frenchy?
She' s just a front.
But without Frenchy we' re dead.
We can get any broad to sell cookies.
I say she gets a share, but not a full share.
I' d go for that.
What if we each get a fourth and she gets like a third?
Are you nuts?
- How do you figure?
- Where you gonna get four fourths and a third?
- I don' t do fractions.
Let' s not get greedy.
Remember that movie with Humphrey Bogart... when they' re diggin 'for gold in the mountains?
Then this guy goes nuts and he turns on his friends.
Let' s not let that happen here.
Then he gets killed by Hispanics.
- What is it?
The Treasure of -- - Treasure Island.
- Treasure Island!
That' s right.
- It was the best.
- I' m out of cookies, okay?
It' s gonna be like another two minutes, so that' s the way the cookie crumbles, okay?
You know who' s gonna eat this?
Me.
I gotta put on help.
- Yeah.
I can' t handle the volume.
A second person you wanna put on?
The cookies are selling.
Gee, I never counted on that.
You know, you gotta manage it somehow.
What about my cousin May?
We can trust her.
May' s a dodo.
I' m gonna bring a dodo into a master plan?
She' s not a squealer.
She' s not a squealer, but then we' d have to cut her in.
Meanwhile, the pot' s getting smaller and smaller.
We' il get caught.
You know what we could do?
We could hire May and not tell her what we' re doin '.
She' s got, you know -- And, and --
- We' re making enough dough from the cookies to pay her.
- Absolutely!
She' il never figure out or catch wise to anything.
Because if you think Denny and Tommy are slow, your cousin May is dumb like a horse, or dog or something.
Well, maybe it' s not such a great idea.
No, I think we could do it.
Right here?
- We' re supposed to be here.
Where' s the sugar?
Frenchy wants more sugar.
We' re busy.
I just don' t understand about the drilling.
We' re expanding.
Ah.
Where are they gonna drink the tea?
In the tunnel?
I' d explain it to you, but you gotta understand engineering.
- What' s engineering?
That' s all you gotta know.
How can you expand?
There' s a nail shop next door.
- We made a deal with them.
- So you' re expanding into the nail shop.
May, get your stuff.
Take a hike.
Get the sugar and go.
We' il call you.
I' m tellin 'you.
- You think it' s safe having that strange broad here?
- Don' t worry, she' s harmless.
I think we made a wrong turn.
I don' t think we' re still headed to the bank.
- Please.
Gimme the map.
- What are you talking about?
For God' s sakes.
I don' t know what you' re all in a dither about.
You' re holding it upside down.
I am?
You were reading this map upside down all along?
Get off my back!
Can I help it if they print these things like this?
Thank you very much.
I gotta get another plate of the cherry --
Next?
- I' m coming right back.
- Two cherry cinnamon.
- How you doin '?
- Sure.
- You' re new here, huh?
This is my first day.
These are the greatest cookies I ever tasted.
- Really?
You know, we' re expanding.
- No kiddin '?
There' s some guys in the back working now.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Did you try the pecan fudge?
- Yes.
- I was telling him about the restaurant.
- What restaurant?
The tea room.
- Under the nail shop?
- What are you talking about?
- The tea room in the back.
- May, come and serve these people!
We' re at the Sunset Bake Shop where the lines wait patiently... for what some people are calling the most fabulous cookie treat in New York.
What the hell is goin 'on here?
And you are the heart and soul of Sunset Cookies.
- Miss, uh -- - Frenchy Winkler.
My real name' s Frances but everybody calls me Frenchy.
My God! of hot chocolate, cinnamon, fresh cherries and a dozen other mouthwatering taste treats.
Is it true customers wait on line for half an hour for a single cookie?
- Yeah, it happened like once.
But what' re you making all the fuss about?
Well, I don' t know.
It' s the only thing I can cook.
- That and linguini with turkey meatballs.
Sir, how would you describe your cookie?
It' s baked with nutmeg or something.
- I just know it' s great.
- There are men in the back now tunneling -- - No, no, May!
Get back --
I can' t take this, Frenchy.
We don' t want this kind of attention.
They just showed up!
I know, but it' s really putting us in the toilet.
And today Denny got bit by a rat.
- Who, the rat?
- Very funny.
I am!
Open your eyes!
- Come on!
How much longer is it gonna take?
It' s complicated!
We keep getting lost.
The other day I was deep in the tunnel, my hat went out.
- That' s right.
It' s a lifesaver, that hat.
We' d have done better just with a cookie store.
We' re making good dough. "Making good dough." It' s a cookie store, but we' re making dough.
We' re making dough --
I get it, I get it.
I knew we were going the wrong way.
I knew it!
- What the hell we doin 'in a dress shop?
We can patch this up and get out of here.
- How we gonna patch it up?
- We tile it and we get out.
I' m not a tiler.
- We don' t have any tiles.
Where do you get cement in the middle of a dress shop?
Besides, Brain, how are we going to close the hole and tile it?
How do we get out?
Well, you tile -- He' s got a point.
You can' t tile this from the other side.
- No kidding.
- No, you can' t.
This is very discouraging, guys.
- I' m ready to pack this in.
- Everybody freeze!
Hey, Ray, your wife' s cousin talks too much.
Sorry to spoil your expansion plans, fellas.
We didn' t do anything yet.
But we screwed up everything, except for the cookie shop.
The cookie shop' s doing great for some reason.
You like the cookies.
Let us forget everything we were gonna do and concentrate on the cookie store.
Look, I' m not here trying to ruin anybody' s life, okay?
Then give us a break.
Think I could get a little piece of the action?
I' m not opposed to paying off the cops.
It' s a standard business expense.
That' s the thing.
I don' t want you to think of it as a payoff.
I think I' m qualified to make what I believe... is a major contribution to this enterprise.
My brother- in- law majored in business.
Let us hear this contribution, all right?
- One word.
And that word is?
Franchise.
We make a lot of different cookies.
We make chicken chip cookies, tuna mint.
Virtually overnight, the Winklers and their associates... have gone from a small, modest mom and pop cookie shop... to something approaching a baking empire.
This is where we package everything.
And that' s all put on with a chemical spray.
There' s no denying that he' s refreshingly down to Earth... for a corporate executive.
So offbeat, in fact, that Sunset Farms... has captured the imagination of the public and the industry.
So we went to Paul Milton of American Cookies.
The bottom line is, they make a really great product.
You have what the public wants, and everything else takes care of itself.
- This is your office?
- This is pretty much where I operate.
She' s got, uh, all her stuff here.
This is an antique, you know.
She says it' s, like, Louis XlV or Louis XV.
It' s, uh -- I don' t know how high the Louises go, actually.
- She' s a creative decorator.
- It' s very original.
- Um, how much are you worth?
- Oh, plenty, plenty.
Just between you and me.
- A lot.
We' re worth a lot of dough.
Whatever you see is antiques.
This thing here.
It think it' s the Renaissance or the Magna Carta or something.
Why did you decide to go into baking so late in life?
Well, Frenchy, we found out, can make cookies.
- and reigning culinary genius of Sunset, - Hello. is Frances Fox, who happens to be the wife of the C. E. O.
So you made cookies your whole life, and everybody told you how delicious they were.
I thought they were "B. S. ing" me, you know?
- Really?
Somebody gives you something they cooked, you always say you enjoyed it... even if it makes you throw up afterwards, so, you know --
In a day and age where everyone seems to have public relations handlers, it' s hard to imagine a corporate brain trust... that is more direct and less image conscious than the group here at Sunset Farms.
Like Tommy Walker, the chairman of the board.
Frenchy makes the best cookies in the world.
We' re very proud of her cookies.
What are your duties as chairman of the board?
The board meets once or twice a week, and we take up important issues.
- Yeah.
Normal stuff.
What kind of problems?
Last week the toilet on the fourth floor wouldn' t flush.
It flushed, but the water kept coming to the top.
So the board voted on getting a plumber.
One of the architects of Sunset Farms' unorthodox marketing strategy... is the head of advertising, Denny Doyle, a former truck driver.
Was it you who came up with the idea to advertise baked goods... in Playboy, Penthouse and Hustler Magazine?
It' s human nature.
So if he' s salivating, he turns the page and comes across a picture of, say, our pistachio cream cookies.
It' s science.
It' s like Pablo' s Theory, you know, with the dog when he feeds him?
- Pablo?
- Pablo, with the dogs.
Then there' s ex- police officer Ken Deloach, vice president in charge of distribution.
And Benjamin Borkowski, vice president in charge of plant safety.
First thing I did was make sure the building was fireproof.
May Sloan is in charge of public relations and also physical therapy.
But physical therapy?
And that' s really hard on the back and leg muscles.
I do deep massage.
By the way, she' s also a vice president.
So there you have it.
A brief glimpse into a corporate culture... that has industry leaders and management analysts all over the country... scratching their heads, trying to figure out what Sunset Farms might try next.
It may be as simple as what Paul Milton, the Winklers' chief competitor said:
"If you' ve got something the American public wants, everything else falls into place."
"There' s no accounting for the public' s taste."
Okay, keep coming through with this stuff.
It' s better the way I had it.
Darling, could you put the doll by the ceramic zebra?
Excuse me.
- You wanted to check the menu.
- Right.
Try it again next to the fireplace.
I want a lot of nuts and "crude- ites."
What did we say for openers?
Oh, yes.
Snails.
Yes.
Truffles, by all means.
But I hate those thin pieces.
Lay it on big time.
Truffles are always shaved really finely.
- Right.
And spinach souffle, and salad, and dessert.
- Oh, and finger bowls.
- There' s nothing being served that requires finger bowls.
Okay?
- Did you rearrange this place again?
- All right, hold your water.
Don' t tell me to hold my water.
Every night it' s like walking into a strange house.
What is this thing?
Did I tell you to get rid of this?
It' s a harp.
You got no flair, Ray.
Don' t tell me I got no flair.
Nobody plays the harp.
What' s it doing in the middle of the living room?
I like the visual sweep.
You' re so hoity- toity all of a sudden.
My cookies pay for this, so turn it off.
What' s for dinner?
'Cause I wouldn' t care if I had anything on a bed of lettuce anymore.
- They' re pheasants, and you ate 'em last week.
Remember I got BB' s in the mouth?
Can I get a cheeseburger?
It' s the dinner party tonight!
Oh!
- Just when I got a lot on my mind.
- Your mind don' t hold a lot.
Get dressed.
- I' m hungry.
I don' t wanna get dressed now.
- You want a snail?
I' m gonna have a snail?
You eat steamers.
A snail leaves a trail of scum in the yard when it walks.
- Not in France they don' t.
That' s what I like.
That' il hold you till the company comes.
Truffles got no flavor!
Only pigs can find them.
That' s what that is.
Take a hike.
You' re such an ignoramus.
That' s what I love about you.
- Pearls come in oysters.
- Ray, Ray, Ray.
- Please, don' t spoil my big night.
- What' s so big about tonight?
There' s important people coming from the arts, and I want to get on some of those boards.
Hey, we donate, you' il be on the boards.
- But I wanna be a patron.
- What you wanna be is a socialite.
So what?
Is that so terrible?
You know, when we talked about making it, we were gonna hit it big, move to Florida, we were gonna swim, eat stone crabs.
Well, we can get a place at Palm Beach.
Palm Beach is ritzy.
I wanna go to Miami.
I wanna be at the dog track every day.
I just know I wanna be as far away from Frenchy Fox, the topless wonder, as I can be.
Hey, you were beautiful as Frenchy Fox.
- You' d give it a little of this, a little of that.
- Those days are over, Ray.
We' re gonna be twice as big next year.
What' s it all mean?
Ray, please, be charming tonight.
You sparkle.
All right?
I gotta go take a shower.
Good evening.
Welcome to our humble abode.
This is my wife Emily.
- How you doin '?
- David Perret.
- Linda Rhinelander.
- Just some Evian.
Unless you have Perrier?
- Certainly.
Whatever you want, you can have.
I usually take tap water 'cause the fluoride keeps your teeth from rotting.
Otherwise, they' il drop right out on you, honey.
Hey, look at this!
Hello!
So glad you could attend our humble abode.
We just got back from Caneel Bay.
Didn' t want to miss the new Traviata.
- Have you seen it?
- No, not yet.
Nor have I.
Exactly what is it?
Ray, why are we standing around in the hallway?
Please, let' s retire to the living room.
- Her?
Please, call me French -- Uh, Frances.
Frances Fox Winkler.
The Foxes from Saratoga?
I don' t know.
I never checked my pedigree.
- Can we change the music, please?
- I feel like I should be wearing a wig.
- You will in a couple years.
Yes.
They say I have a flair for decorating.
- You know, this rug lights up?
Yeah.
The fiber optics.
I' il turn it on later.
- Stevens, what' s with the snails?
Right.
- Do you play the harp, Frances?
- Oh, no.
It' s a visual, honey.
The sweep kills me.
Oh, finally.
Girls.
Hold it.
Right there.
All the action -- Hey, honey.
Hey, shake it.
They' re in the other room.
- How you doin '?
- What?
- Garth Steinway.
- I' m Anthony Gwynne.
- On, no kidding?
Tony Gwynne, the outfielder with the Padres?
- which has gotten such good notices.
- Right.
Count me in.
I love serious music.
Ray, on the other hand, opera freaks him.
Have you tried your finger bowl?
The guy says to him, "What do you do for a living?"
He says, "I' m a momback."
"What' s a momback?"
He says, "I stand behind a truck.
He stands behind the truck and goes, "Momback, momback."
He says -- I think it' s too fast for her. "Momback."
He says, "Momback."
I' m afraid I do think they overpaid for the Picasso.
For me it was unusually mediocre, don' t you think?
- I agree completely.
I have to find my wife.
It might have been the Holocaust.
- Are you affiliated with any of the museums?
Oh.
We have one or two paintings, but I haven' t really gotten around to building a collection yet.
Uh- huh.
What' s your --
Michelangelo.
- You know, the boys.
I might be out of Michelangelos at the moment.
But I did recently come into possession of an incredible Damon Dexter... that someone' s trying to sell.
I don' t think I' m aware of him.
Well, he' s new, you know.
I have to say, your wine is absolutely delicious.
Really.
It was chosen by the same chef who did the finger bowls.
Have you rinsed?
David used to be part owner of a vineyard, so he' s a tough audience.
Did you study art at school?
No, I didn' t.
I often think I should have.
I studied literature.
And then, yeah, I did teach art at Amherst for a bit.
And then the vineyard.
And you' re still so young.
Somewhere in a closet there' s a portrait of me aging.
In the closet?
Why would it be in --
How droll.
You hear about the Polish car pool?
Every day they' d meet at work.
- I don' t know --
This takes bad taste to new heights.
- This is excruciating.
Can you believe the two of them?
I can' t keep a straight face.
The sheer flawless vulgarity of it all!
- Don' t knock it.
They plan on being very generous, and for that we must be thankful.
And what about the harp?
- Not to mention the way she wears her clothes.
Oh, I' d say so.
I never saw so much jewelry.
It makes me sad, Frenchy, that I don' t have to steal anymore.
What' s the matter?
You' ve been quiet all night.
What is bothering you?
What' s bothering me is we got no class.
I was very charming tonight.
I was killin 'them with jokes.
I got a little drunk from the wine, so I went to sit down in the bar.
Some of them were in there talking about us.
You should' ve heard 'em.
Stop it!
We got more dough than all of 'em put together.
It' s knowing the finer things.
Like what?
Opera?
Like food and wine, and painting, and books.
Stop it, will ya?
I' m unimpressed.
I could never afford to learn anything.
There was always some emergency, and I was a good student.
And I don' t care about it.
I' d put a contract out on her.
Class is something you can' t fake and you can' t buy.
I got more class in my little finger than they all got combined.
- We' re trying to act like big shots.
- Not me!
Well, me.
But it' s over.
The time has come to use our dough to amount to something.
- Like what?
- To change our lives.
I' m too busy to change my life.
Doin 'what?
Playing pinball?
I don' t like it.
- I wanna go to Florida and swim.
- I wanna be the real thing!
And you better wise up, 'cause if I grow and you stay as stupid as you are, we' re gonna have big problems, Ray.
Is that what you said?
You know art, opera, books, wine.
I' m incredibly flattered that you' d think I was capable of --
Turning two slugs like us into classy items?
I never did homework when I was young.
I' m not doing anything that' s got homework to it.
Naturally, we would make it very worth your while, David.
I don' t know.
I' ve never been asked to do anything like this before, and I' m not sure I' d know where to start.
I know I gotta get a better vocabulary.
College?
I didn' t go to high school.
What the hell am I gonna go to college for?
- Lessons in life.
- Am I crazy?
She' s nuts.
Tell her she' s nuts.
I' m gonna learn about life suddenly?
I must say, Frenchy, Ray has a point.
He could probably teach me a lot more about life than I could ever teach you.
What the hell is he gonna teach you?
- I know how to count cards at a blackjack table.
- Would you close your bazoo?
- I can count four jacks -- - Close your bazoo!
It' s amazing.
The one thing I would like.
I would like to learn how to spell Connecticut.
I never knew how to spell Connecticut.
Great!
You could teach him that, right?
- Yeah.
Like I say,
I haven' t --
If I could envisage a plan, some kind of starting point --
We could start by building our art collection.
That way you' d make a few bucks, and we can learn something.
But no museums.
I' m not goin 'to museums.
- The virgins --
- Spooked by the virgins.
I' m sorry.
Work on the laugh, Frenchy.
So, you can see the difference between this Tintoretto... and the earlier Byzantine painting we looked at.
What would you say is the most significant difference?
I would say that the frame' s bigger here.
Mm- hmm.
But there' s also a difference in the paintings themselves, isn' t there?
And it' s an important difference because it characterizes... the great technical leap from the ancient into the modern world.
You remember how those saints had very flat faces... and the background was on the same plane as the foreground?
- Perspective.
That' s it.
Let me show you another very good example of that.
"The frame on this one is bigger"?
Boy, you are a dummy.
Don' t give me "perspective."
Take a hike.
Take a hike.
Twenty- eight.
Fifty- one.
- Levoxyl.
U- ni- ty con.
- Eighty- seven.
- Ninety... four.
- Darvocet.
Red- du- tem- puh.
- I' m hungry.
Can we get outta here?
- You' re always hungry.
- Why don' t you try and learn something?
- There' s nothing to learn.
- Interesting fact.
This is where Henry James lived.
- The bandleader, stupid.
- Married to Betty Grable?
Henry James married to Grable.
Yeah?
- Oh.
This is where he lived and where he worked, and --
I' m hungry.
I remember.
The Hair- ess, right?
- The "H" is silent.
- Oh, did he write that too?
Oh, gee.
Frenchy, I' m still sick.
I' m weak.
You' re gonna miss a very interesting "Great Books" discussion.
It kills me.
It just kills me.
But I' m just gonna lay here.
I' il see you when you come back.
- How are you?
- Hello.
Ray' s got a cold.
- I bet 500.
- Five hundred?
- See your five, raise you 500.
- I' m outta here.
I see the five... and a thou.
What' d you think of the book?
Well, I thought it was very romantic.
I mean, he loved her but their backgrounds were so different.
So, what?
You thought he was doomed from the start?
But, uh, I think that two people from different backgrounds can make it... if, uh, the juice is there.
- Right.
Juice is -- - You know, the hots.
Right.
Would you like some wine?
I brought over a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
Ah, that' s brilliant, because we can compare that to my Clos de la Roche... and you can see the difference between a Bordeaux and a Burgundy.
I' ve got two other Burgundies of the same vintage... that I thought might be fun for us to try.
I' il see your five and raise you a thou.
I' il see it and raise you a thousand more.
And a thousand.
- And a thousand.
- Okay.
A pair of threes.
I thought you were bluffing.
What do you want to play now?
What about Indian poker?
Nobody sees their hand.
Wanna sit down, May?
How about Old Maid?
Do you play Old Maid?
So, um... try this one.
Okay.
Nice nose.
The bouquet is very special.
I mean you got a nice nose.
- Me?
It' s like, kinda --
- It' s just any old nose, I think.
Um, talking of which, how is your vocabulary coming along?
Oh, very good.
I' m almost through all the "A" words in the dictionary.
Right, right.
The thing is, I' m not 100 percent convinced... that memorizing the dictionary is the best way to improve your vocabulary.
Hmm.
I can' t believe you found a buyer for the Damon Dexter so fast.
And at such a good price.
It' il really take a bite out of our debts.
Oliver, it' s dawning on me that the opportunity has arisen... for me to become quite obscenely rich.
How serious are they about building an art collection?
That would be peanuts.
What, then?
Well, I think that she might be falling for me.
Frenchy Winkler?
How much do you think she' s worth, roughly?
- Her husband you mean.
She' s the cookie mogul.
- What are you saying?
And women remarry, you know?
- What is this?
- It' s a Damon Dexter, a discovery of David' s.
I say it' s depressing.
Knock it off.
You wouldn' t know a masterpiece if it bit you in the ass.
- I refuse to look at this, Frenchy.
- What is that supposed to mean?
It means as long as this is on that wall, I don' t look at that wall.
- You' re a head case!
- I' il bet David made a big profit on this.
Hey, whose cookies pay the rent, huh?
I think he' s making a fool outta you.
Tell me what time it is.
I no longer look at this wall.
- 11: 00 a. m., sir.
- Thank you very much.
- David, what' s this?
- Oh, well, that' s a citrine necklace.
- You know about citrines?
- No.
But the luster' s always been considered very special and unique.
- And that?
- Ah, yeah.
Well, if we' re talking about luster, this is something very special and I' d imagine very, very expensive.
It' s a cigarette case encrusted with diamonds that belonged to the Duke of Windsor.
- Yeah?
He also married beneath his station, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Oh, my God, the Duke and Duchess.
I saw it on television.
Uh- huh?
Ray?
Ray!
What are you doin 'here?
I' m havin 'Chinese food.
That' s what they serve in a Chinese restaurant.
You want some company?
Who?
What do you mean?
Me.
Well, where' s Frenchy?
Frenchy' s at some piano concert with a guy.
Oh.
They have takeout here, but I don' t think they' il deliver to a concert.
Don' t worry about it, May.
Frenchy' il eat.
You know?
It was -- What a treat!
I' m so sick of continental food every night.
Frenchy eats frogs' legs!
- It' s supposed to taste like chicken.
- Rabbit.
- Rabbit tastes like frogs' legs?
Forget it.
Are you happy being rich?
It' s okay.
I got a maid.
Yeah?
How come?
And he hated that I' d pay for everything.
And actually, that' s when he left me.
- I can understand your -- - You enjoy being rich?
- I hate it!
No, I hate it.
I hate the life.
- And it' s causin 'me to lose Frenchy.
- What do you mean?
I mean, she' s outgrowing me.
That' s just what she said.
She' s like a different person now.
Yeah.
Well, you know, he' s very good- looking, and he' s bright and very charming and very elegant.
Okay, May, I got the picture.
You know, my God, you really know how to make a guy feel good.
- Well, when you' re right, you' re right.
- Thank you.
What did you think of her playing?
I just gotta tell ya, I thought the whole evening was apocalyptic.
- Apocalyptic?
- Yes!
I really was agog.
I mean, she' s fabulous.
She' s fabulous and I have to asseverate, she deserves accolades.
- Frances, you' ve been memorizing the dictionary.
- Yeah, I got the "A' s."
Next week the "B' s."
How do I look?
I have to say that that dress is just... gorgeous on you.
See?
Your influence.
Low key, right?
That' s a very flattering thing to say.
- Ray thinks it' s dullsville.
- Page!
- Wasn' t her choice of the Rachmaninoff inspired?
We loved it.
- At first I thought it might incur my animadversion.
- But soon I realized it was apposite.
- Aha, I think I see drinks.
- Good to see you, David.
- Nice meeting you.
- I love your friends, David.
It' s another world.
Well, it' s a world I know you' d love to belong to.
- Beautiful.
Let' s take a seat over here.
Anything we get, Cody' s in for his full share.
That' s how it is.
- You know why I respect Cody Jarrett?
- Why?
- Because he loves his mother.
- I can understand that, May.
Because even though he' s a vicious, coldblooded, psychopathic killer, and she encourages him, still it' s sweet.
Yeah, has a sweetness.
I wish I had a mother like that.
- More Pepsi?
- Yeah, please.
And this is the best part, isn' t it?
I love this part.
Will you pass me the Cracker Jack?
What are you looking at?
I happen to be noticing you.
'cause for the first time I had the thought... that in a very strange way, you got a sweet face.
It' s offbeat, you know, in a kind of bizarre, you know --
It' s -- I don' t know how to explain it exactly, but it' s right up there.
What do you mean?
I mean it as a compliment.
I never before classified you as a, you know, a human- type female, so --
I was married.
This was a long time ago, right?
Oh!
That is -- That' s --
- Yeah.
- What did you want to talk to me about?
I' ve, um, I' ve got a little present for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
Ohh!
Pretty!
I love leather books.
Oh, Pygmalion!
I love that story, David.
There' s, um -- You see a little inscription there?
"To my favorite Eliza, from your Professor Higgins.
Love, David. "
- Gee, I got a confession to make.
- What?
I got you a present too.
Oh, no.
No, you didn' t have to do that.
It' s in appreciation of all the stuff you' ve been doin 'for me,
- 'cause I know it' s a hard job.
- Oh, my God!
Frenchy!
This is --
- Frances!
- Frances, this is --
It must' ve cost you a fortune.
What good' s having dough unless you spend it, huh?
Well, I know, but this is so extravagant.
I' m embarrassed.
I' m not suggesting you take up smoking, but I figured, you know, what' s good enough for the Duke of Windsor, right?
And I feel, you know, my little pathetic Bernard Shaw...
- No!
But you see, I just wanted you to know...
- how unbelievably proud I am of you.
- This is not insignificant.
Maybe I' m talking out of turn here, but... you' ve just developed so much, and I just feel, you know, you belong in a world of society and high culture now.
You should be branching out, you should be traveling.
There' s Paris and Rome and the great opera houses and the museums, you know.
You should be in a position to cultivate the right kinds of friends.
Anyway, I' m, you know, bif.
It' s hard, you know, 'cause Ray' s not like that.
He likes to watch TV in his underwear, suckin 'a Bud.
Yeah.
Well, that -- I don' t know what to say.
I can' t comment on that.
- Can I be frank, David?
- Mm- hmm.
Sometimes I think I' ve outgrown him.
- Pretty late.
- Yeah, you too.
What did you do?
I, you know, I worked late... and then May and me had some Chinese food.
You and May!
Cartoons?
- We watched White Heat on television.
No.
Then we went out and we got a pizza.
Chinese food and a pizza?
With your stomach, I' m surprised you weren' t shot... breaking into the Pepto- Bismol factory.
No, Frenchy, I had fun.
It was the first time in a long time I had a good time.
- I want to talk to you, Ray.
I thought we might go along, see some sights.
What kind of sights?
You know, churches, opera houses, ruins.
What are you, a stroke victim?
I' m gonna fly 3, 000 miles to see opera houses and ruins?
- Well, I wanna go.
- What do you mean, you wanna go?
- It' s part of my cultural development.
- Will you knock it off?
Stop puttin 'on airs.
David thinks that it would be good for me to travel through Europe.
I get a bad vibe about this guy.
Because you' re a crook, so you think everybody is.
I wish I still was a crook, then I' d feel like an actual person again.
I warned you that this would happen if you didn' t grow along with me.
The only thing that' s grown about you is your rear end from too much French food.
I' m sorry, Ray, but I wanna go to Europe.
What do you mean?
You can' t just go to Europe with David.
I asked you to come.
'Cause you knew I' d say no.
That' s why you asked me.
My idea of fun is not goin 'to operas and ruins.
I get enough sleep at home.
I never thought I' d be saying this to you, Ray, but maybe the time has come to reevaluate our marriage.
If you go to Europe with David, you' re gonna have to reevaluate it big time.
I' m going!
I won' t be held back mentally... by some overaged juvenile delinquent.
- Then you better go get yourself a lawyer.
I' il go fifty- fifty with you even though it' s all in my name.
Exactly right, because --
I just want out.
You know, May, it was on a boat that I first proposed to Frenchy.
Yeah, I know.
All of a sudden, I' m not her type after all these years.
- May I tell you something?
You' re not my type either.
What does that mean?
What the hell does that mean?
It means that maybe Frenchy... wasn' t so wrong to try and make something out of herself.
- Frenchy was nuts!
Frenchy overdid everything.
- You underdo everything!
You know, there' s more to life than turkey meatballs.
I get a bad vibe about this guy, David.
It' s my street instinct, but I just don' t trust him.
Yeah, I know why.
Because he' s younger than you are, handsomer than you are, he' s much taller than you are, he' s smarter than you are, he' s much more exciting than you are --
May, don' t feel obligated to pull any punches with me.
It' s more romantic.
So if I had it to do over again, I would do some things differently.
Maybe I' d sit through a couple of more operas with Frenchy, especially now since they got the new Sony Walkmans.
Now that you split up with Frenchy, you don' t even work.
No, I don' t work, May, but I got an idea for something, and I wanna talk to you about it.
Really?
What a place!
Chi Chi Valezquez Potter.
It' s a very famous necklace.
- Would it have been on television?
But it' s been in magazines.
I could live off that necklace if I fence it for the rest of my life.
But you gotta remember what happened when you tunneled into the bank.
But that' s the beauty part.
We don' t have to tunnel anymore.
So Chi Chi invited us to a big party there in a couple of weeks.
You come with me, we get the necklace.
Oh, uh, see, I never heisted anything before.
Because this has been on my mind for a while.
I was very crafty.
I went upstairs, and I checked out the place.
I scoped it all out, and I found the safe.
I got the whole layout in my mind up there, so I know we can do this.
If this is such a big item, then they' re gonna be turning the town upside down looking for it.
That' s why you' re dealing with a particularly shrewd mentality.
I got a connection in Chinatown.
I bring in a picture that I got from a magazine of the necklace.
He makes me an exact duplicate.
She never knows what happened.
Chi Chi' s a dumb, flighty society dame.
She' s crazy.
I' il be in Florida or The Cayman Islands.
Hello?
What?
- I can' t hear you.
What?
- I' m in a crypt!
I can' t -- - Please.
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
How?
Okay?
What?
Today?
Look, what do you mean it' s an emergency?
- Oh, hi.
- Mrs. Winkler?
We' re so sorry to bring you back from your vacation.
- What the hell' s goin 'on, fellas?
- I have terrible news.
- Something' s happened to Ray?
- Sunset Enterprises is bankrupt.
- How?
- Fraud.
- Fraud?
Who?
- Your accountants.
I don' t even know who they are.
What?
You should' ve looked.
We let them handle everything.
What the hell do I know about running a corporation?
Did you ever read anything you signed?
No, but they assured us everything was okay.
May I get you a drink?
I' d like a 1961 Romanee St. Vivant if we have it.
I' d have a whiskey if I were you.
I mean, Sunset' s gone?
Can' t we do anything?
You might be able to put a few people in jail if we could find them.
This is the worst news.
Oh, no, no.
Mrs. Winkler, it' s not.
No?
Well, it is to me!
No, no, no.
The worst news is coming up.
All right.
All right.
Let me sit down.
They spoke to you about expanding Sunset.
We' ve been planning it for months.
Yeah.
Are you aware of that?
- Quite a substantial loan.
- Get to the point.
They asked you to sign a promissory note to the bank.
You' re speaking to the wrong person.
This is what I got accountants for.
Yes, but unfortunately your accountants are in Venezuela.
Wh -- This is all so confusing.
Frances, you put up your home and savings as a note for a monster loan.
Could you put a touch of cyanide in here?
It needs to be stronger.
You' ve lost it all, Frenchy.
Or should I say, you' ve been swindled out of it all?
- You mean, I got -- - Nothing.
Mrs. Winkler, you have nothing.
Just a couple of large, outstanding loans... which we feel you can best deal with by filing for bankruptcy.
Bankruptcy?
Bankruptcy?
- I' m not up to the "B" words yet.
Does Ray know about this?
What difference does it make to Ray?
What did you say?
I' m bankrupt.
Sunset' s gone.
All my personal dough is gone.
The whole ride' s over.
Well, how --
- I mean, how could that possibly happen?
My accountants.
Oh, Ray said not to trust them because the whole firm had mustaches.
I' m, I' m gonna get myself a little Valium.
David, I' m not gonna be able to give you that loan I promised you.
What did you say?
Suddenly it turns out I got people I owe.
I know, but you did say that I could borrow400, 000.
- I was using it to cement a deal.
- I know, and it kills me!
I' m flat.
- What an idiot.
Yeah.
How could you be so stupid and irresponsible... as to allow some patently cheap, thieving accountants... to defraud you out of a future?
I just don' t understand how anyone could be that stupid.
Aren' t you a little out of line?
I' ve made commitments to people.
Wow.
I can never remember.
Think of the time I' ve put in nurturing an idea that' s not gonna happen.
Is that what it was?
The money?
I need my little blue pills.
So I' m gonna go and get them, and I would very, very much appreciate it if when I came back, you were gone.
Thank you.
- I' d like the cigarette case back.
- I don' t think so, my love.
Wow.
I asked you for lessons in life.
I guess I really got one, right?
Oh, we' re so glad you could come!
- How are you?
Langston wants to talk to you about a theater project in Aspen.
- Do you ski?
- Me?
- Do either of you play miniature golf?
- Oh, there' s Binky!
- Oh, hello!
- Oh, for heaven' s sake.
Mingle.
I don' t think you should say anything.
But you said make conversation.
I know.
Make conversation, but don' t talk.
Don' t bring up anything.
Maybe about the weather or something, but don' t -- You know.
Now, I' m gonna get in the flow of things here and then I' m gonna glide upstairs.
- Should I glide with you?
- No, no.
I' il contact you.
- Can I get you some champagne?
- Sure.
Ray?
I was ju -- I was gonna make a phone call.
- Have you seen Edgar?
- Edgar?
- I was gonna make a phone --
I' ve looked back here, and downstairs.
- Try back there.
- I' il try that.
Thank you.
Oh, Winkler?
- Do you play golf?
- Golf?
I was just gonna make a phone call upstairs.
- I guess I was misdirected.
- Yes, well, I was gonna use the phone.
I' m sorry.
I wanted a match on Sunday, but I' il get somebody else.
I would' ve looked forward to it.
There' il be rain over the tristate area and increasing fog.
Temperatures will hover in the low 60s till Tuesday.
I must say, you are most amusing.
Would you like a canape?
I don' t have any idea what they are.
They lodge in your throat.
And you?
I' m a lookout.
I noticed the way you walked and carried yourself from across the room.
You remind me of my wonderful, departed wife.
That' s physically impossible.
You' re charming.
You' re the first woman I' ve met since Helen died that I could say that about.
Was Helen your wife, or just a woman who died?
Where' s Mr. Winkler?
I want to talk to him.
Oh, he' s around mingling.
With a chance of light sprinkles followed by sunshine.
Right.
Chi Chi, would you get those photographs from the bedroom?
I wanna show Mr. Winkler the property in Aspen where we' re gonna build the theater.
I just wanna talk to Dr. Henske.
He would be perfect to do Beth Kramer' s face work... after the unbelievable job he did on Mrs. Morton' s buttocks.
Oh, I' m gonna be right back.
Ray?
You scared me.
For God' s sakes!
I came to warn you.
Mrs. Potter' s gonna come up here... to get some pictures that Mr. Potter wants you to see.
- She' s lookin 'for you.
- Now, I closed the safe!
I can' t --
- Did they see you come up here?
- I, I don' t think so.
Get out there and stand watch.
I' m gonna do this again.
Are you okay?
Get out!
If you could fit it into your schedule, it would mean so much to Beth.
And don' t you think... he got custody of the polo ponies.
- Where' d he go?
- I' il get them.
- So, you will try?
- I' il do my best.
Kiss, kiss.
Mrs. Potter is coming.
- She' s gone.
- Shh, not so loud.
But she' s gone.
She' s gone.
I want to show those to Mr. Winkler.
- He wouldn' t leave without saying good- bye, would he?
- I don' t know, he' s not upstairs.
- Jesus.
- I met a wonderful man downstairs.
He seemed to like me.
But I assume he meant when she was alive.
May, can you stop talking to me while I' m doing this?
Bright yellow shirt, unbelievable tie.
I think I know the gentleman you mean.
He was going up the stairs before.
- Yes.
Mr. Winkler.
Ray, I hear something.
Oh!
- Yes, she' s had one of her spells.
- Spells?
- Yes, she gets spells.
We have a doctor right here.
- No, not necessary.
- I' m a hemophiliac.
Are you bleeding?
- Why would I be bleeding?
No, she -- Her neck.
It is, but my nasal passages are clearing up now.
On weekends, I do this for a little hobby.
- Poor darling.
I' il go get Dr. Henske.
Really, I' m -- Ray, you have my cortisone pills.
- Me?
- My medication?
I will feel a whole lot better if I let Dr. Henske take a look at her.
No, no, you just relax, put your feet up, and I' il go get Dr. Henske.
Cortisone?
Where did you come up with these things?
- It' s on TV.
I said stay with the weather.
I thought I did some really quick thinking.
Meanwhile, you' re gonna be examined now.
Why?
I just had a checkup.
I got no time to work here.
They' il be back in seconds.
I can' t tell the difference between these.
Then you better take 'em both.
- I' il go right to jail.
- Especially with your D. N. A.
What does my D. N. A. got to do with it?
You better make a choice, 'cause they' re gonna be back any minute.
Ray, let' s go!
All I know is what I told you, Doctor.
She' s right in here.
Here' s Dr. Henske.
Now, what seems to be the trouble?
False alarm.
I' ve seen it before.
- I' m given to occasional spells.
- Spells?
Well, not spells, but, you know, she was drinkin 'booze --
The room will begin to spin, then spots before my eyes, a ringing in my ears.
Little pinpoints of light and my tongue turns black, and I can' t swallow.
- Really?
But they think it could be the Ebola virus or Mad Cow Disease.
We gotta get her out of here because, you know, it' s a false positive.
Come, sweetheart, we' re due, we' re due.
And not to worry, Mr. Winkler, the theater in Aspen will just have to wait.
The Ebola virus or Mad Cow.
- I just said the first thing that came into my mouth.
- Great.
- I tried to do my best -- - Hello again!
George!
Do I still remind you of your wife?
You' re great.
You' re not feeling well.
She' s not feeling well.
May Sloan.
I' il, I' il be better.
Well, I' il call you.
- Ray, I just got the news about Frenchy.
- Frenchy?
Didn' t you hear?
Sunset' s gone under.
She was defrauded out of every penny she owns and then some.
And I know you' re out of there, but I figured you' d know.
Yeah, sure, I do know.
I came as soon as I heard.
I got exactly what I deserved.
I really missed you, Frenchy.
I' m sorry I blew our cookie company, but I' m even more sorry I blew our marriage, Ray.
What do you do?
Everybody makes mistakes, you know what I mean?
The important thing is I still love you.
I don' t deserve it.
I behaved badly.
You behaved like an ass, but that' s one of those "A" words you used to practice.
But I' m not the easiest guy to get along with.
I' m not Mr. Sensitive.
There' s a lot of things I could' ve done differently, maybe.
That' s the truth.
So where' s David now?
- He split the second I went bust.
I don' t believe it.
- He was hustling me for the dough.
- Oh, jeez.
So now we gotta all begin again, you know.
And in more ways than one.
- Still want you?
Frenchy, you gotta ask a question like that?
I' m crazy about you.
I' m crazy about you too.
I' m nuts for you.
You got -- Of course I want you.
We haven' t got a dime.
We don' t even own a stick of this furniture we' re sittin 'on.
Can I show you something?
Will you sit here?
May I show you one thing?
- Can I show you -- Just let me show you something.
I think you' re gonna be very, very proud of me.
- That' s Chi Chi Potter' s.
- Was.
Was Chi Chi -- Was.
Was.
I' m tellin 'you, I never felt so great.
I felt alive, you know.
'Cause I always felt that you were keeping me with this whole cookie thing.
- Hey, this is glass.
- What are you talking about, glass?
How' s it glass?
- It' s fake.
- What do you mean, fake?
How the hell would you know?
This ain' t even good fake.
What do you mean, it' s fake?
You know, it might fool some idiot with no eye or no brains, but it' d never pass with a normal person.
What are you -- You' re telling me that I got the phony one?
- I came away with the wrong thing?
- That sounds like your M. O.
- You' re nuts!
I was in the room.
Then everything got confusing.
It' s good to see you got the same great instincts.
- It really is.
- You take all those lessons, you think you got taste.
You think you learn class and taste, but you know nothing about jewelry.
We go to Florida.
It' s the goods.
That ain' t gonna get us on the subway, much less to Florida.
You know, you' re such a know- everything.
You don' t have to be a rocket scientist to spot a clinker like this.
Whoever made it for you, you overpaid.
What can I do if you' re wrong?
Can I take your nose and twist it till you turn blue?
Sure.
Gee, you broke it.
It' s glass, Ray.
I know, but it' s --
Well, Frenchy, I' m not cleaning it up.
You got glass over everything.
It' s dangerous.
I' m such a screwup.
Don' t you understand?
I got the glass one.
All that matters is that we have each other.
We didn' t there for a while and it made me realize how much I need you.
- Yeah, but you' re married to such a loser, Frenchy.
- I' m the luckiest woman in the world.
And the brokest.
I' m topped out.
We got nothing.
As usual, I come up empty.
We could pawn this.
What is this?
Who?
Who' s the Duke of Windsor?
Actually, we could probably auction it.
- Where' d you get this?
It looks -- - From David.
- David gave you this?
- Well, he doesn' t know it yet.
What do you mean?
Hey, it was you who taught me how to open a safe.
l -- That was one of my fondest memories of our time together.
What are you saying?
You boosted this from David' s safe?
That -- Frenchy, that' s stealing.
Not exactly.
Look, it' s a long story, Ray.
Let' s sell it, and I' il fill you in on the flight to Miami.
- Yeah.
Oh, baby, what I couldn' t do
Oh, baby, what I couldn' t do
With plenty of money and you
In spite of the worry that money brings
Just a little filthy lucre buys a lot of things
And I could take you to places you' d like to go
But outside of that I' ve no use for dough
It' s the root of all evil Of strife and upheaval
But I' m certain, honey that life could be sunny
With plenty of money and you
Tequila
On September 3rd 1973 at 6: 28pm and 32 seconds, a bluebottle fly capable of 14, 670 wing beats a minute
landed on Rue St Vincent, Montmartre.
At the same moment, on a restaurant terrace nearby, the wind magically made two glasses dance unseen on a tablecloth.
Meanwhile, in a 5th- floor flat, 28 Avenue Trudaine, Paris 9, returning from his best friend' s funeral, Eugene Colere erased his name from his address book.
At the same moment, a sperm with one X chromosome, belonging to Raphaël Poulain, made a dash for an egg in his wife Amandine.
Amélie Poulain was born.
[The Fabulous Life of Amélie Poulain]
[TlGHT LlPS = HARD HEART]
Raphaël Poulain dislikes:
Peeing next to someone else.
Catching scornful glances at his sandals.
Clingy wet swimming trunks.
Raphaël Poulain likes:
Peeling off large strips of wallpaper.
Lining up all his shoes and polishing them.
Emptying his tool box, cleaning it out, and putting everything back.
Amélie' s mother, Amandine, a schoolmistress from Gueugnon, has always had shaky nerves.
[FAClAL TWlTCH = WEAK NERVES]
Amandine Poulain dislikes:
When someone she doesn' t like brushes against her hand.
Pillow marks on her cheek in the morning.
Figure skaters' costumes on TV.
Polishing the parquet with slippers.
Emptying her handbag, cleaning it out, and putting everything back.
Amélie is six.
Like all little girls, she' d like to be hugged by her daddy.
But he never touches her, except for a monthly checkup.
The thrill of this rare contact makes her heart beat like a drum.
As a result, he thinks she has a heart defect.
Declared unfit for school,
Amélie is taught by her mother.
Four... hens... brood... here... henceforth.
Four hens brood...
Very good.... hens fourth!
Deprived of playmates, tossed about between a neurotic and an iceberg,
Amélie retreats into her imagination.
In this world, LPs are made like pancakes.
The neighbour' s comatose wife has chosen to get all her life' s sleep in one go.
After this, I can stay awake day and night.
Amélie has one friend, Blubber.
Alas, the home environment has made Blubber suicidal.
Blubber' s suicide attempts destroy Mother' s nerves.
A decision is made.
Enough!
To comfort Amélie, her mother gives her a second- hand Instamatic camera.
Little girl!
Look what you did!
A neighbour fools her into thinking her camera causes accidents.
Because she' d been taking pictures all afternoon, Amélie is petrified.
She stares at the TV, racked by the guilt of causing a huge fire, two derailments and ajumbojet crash.
Amélie gets her revenge.
One day tragedy strikes.
Amandine takes Amélie to Notre Dame to light a candle and pray for a baby brother.
Three minutes later, heaven sends, alas, not a baby boy, but Marguerite, a tourist from Quebec, bent on ending her life.
Amandine Poulain is killed instantly.
His unsociable tendencies increase.
He' s obsessed with building a miniature shrine to house his wife' s ashes.
Days, months and years go by.
In such a dead world,
Amélie prefers to dream until she' s old enough to leave home.
Five years later, she' s a waitress in Montmartre at The Two Windmills.
It is August 29th.
But she doesn' t know it yet.
She lives quietly among her colleagues and the café' s regulars.
That' s Suzanne, the owner.
She limps a little but she' s never spilt a drink.
When she was younger, she was a circus rider.
She likes athletes who cry with disappointment.
She dislikes seeing men humiliated in front of their kids in her café.
Georgette is the tobacconist.
She' s a hypochondriac.
Migraines one day, sciatica the next.
She hates the words
"fruit of thy womb".
Gina works with Amélie.
Her grandmother was a healer.
She likes cracking bones.
She' s bringing a kir to Hipolito, a failed writer.
He likes seeing bullfighters gored on TV.
Scowling at them is Joseph, Gina' s rejected lover.
He' s alwaysjealously spying on her.
All he likes is popping bubble wrap.
And here' s Philomene, an air hostess.
Amélie looks after her cat Rodrigue when she' s away.
Philomene likes the sound of the cat' s bowl on the tiles.
Rodrigue likes overhearing children' s stories.
I never work on Sundays.
At weekends, Amélie often takes a train from the Gare du Nord to see her father.
- To do what?
Travel.
You' ve never been away.
- Because of your heart.
I know.
Now...
Some Friday evenings, Amélie goes to the cinema.
I like turning round and looking at people' s faces in the dark.
I like noticing details that no- one else ever sees.
But I hate it in old American movies when drivers don' t watch the road.
Amélie doesn' t have a boyfriend.
She tried once or twice, but the results were a let- down.
Cracking creme brulée with a teaspoon.
And skimming stones on the Canal St Martin.
They call him the Glass Man.
He was born with bones as brittle as crystal.
All his furniture is padded.
A handshake would be enough to crush his fingers.
He' s stayed indoors for 20 years.
Time has changed nothing.
She amuses herself with silly questions about the world below, such as:
"How many couples are having an orgasm now?"
Fifteen.
Finally, on the night of August 30th 1997, comes the event that will change her life for ever.
Lady Di, Princess of Wales, died in a car crash in Paris last night with her companion Dodi Al Fayed...
Only the first man to discover Tutankhamen' s tomb would understand how she felt on finding this treasure hidden by a little boy 40 years ago.
On August 31st at 4am,
Amélie has a dazzling idea.
Wherever he was, she would find the box' s owner and give him back his treasure.
If he was touched, she' d become a regular do- gooder.
If not, too bad.
The girl from the 5th floor!
We don' t see much of you.
Would you know of a boy who lived in my flat in the '50s?
A boy?
Come and have a glass of port.
- Come in!
Close the door.
Boys?
I' ve known so many.
They' re cute until they discover snowballs and chestnuts.
I' ve known so many boys.
- When did you come here?
- In '64.
You' il have heard the story.
No, I don' t think so.
I' m amazed.
Sit down.
My husband worked for Ladybird Insurance.
It' s no secret that he slept with his secretary.
The bimbo liked spreading her legs, but only on satin.
So my husband swiped from the till.
A little at first, then 50 million. off they flew to South America.
Drink up.
on January 20th 1970, my doorbell rang.
"Your husband' s been killed in a car crash in South America."
My life stopped there.
And Black Lion died of heartbreak.
Poor creature.
See how lovingly he still stares at his master?
I' il read you his letters.
No, don' t go!
You can spare five minutes.
He wrote this from the barracks.
"Darling Mado." That' s me.
I' m called Madeleine.
"I can' t sleep, can' t eat, knowing that my only reason to live is far away in Paris.
"The one you think is too transparent."
No.
I' m nobody' s little weasel.
My name' s Madeleine Wells.
And Wells as in water.
Talk about being born to cry!
About your question...
A fig and three hazelnuts, as usual?
- What was their name?
- You' ve got me there, dear.
The mental age of this cretin.
He' s no genius, but Amélie likes him.
She likes the way he handles each endive like a precious object to be treated with care.
It' s his way of showing his love of good work.
Like he' s nursing a baby bird that' s fallen out of its nest!
You' d be here till Monday!
She hasn' t got all day.
She has the memory of an elephant.
Thank you.
Bredoteau.
Sorry?
It' s the name you' re after.
I' m senile.
He' s senile.
See what he' s done to my laurel?
His old job was punching métro tickets.
- In my laurels!
- I' d have preferred lilacs.
Such is life!
- I skim stones.
- You do?
Don' t worry.
- I file everything.
- Like what?
You were still squeezing his toothpaste at 15, so it follows.
Right.
Camus... 2nd floor on the right.
Brossard was on staircase B.
Got it!
Bredoteau, 5th floor on the right.
Bredoteau.
What more can I say?
Groping under the photo booth is Nino Quincampoix.
When Amélie lacked playmates, Nino had too many.
Five miles apart, one dreamed of having a sister, the other a brother to spend all their time with.
Hi, Dad.
A new friend?
No, I' ve had him for years.
Your mother hated him, so he lived in the tool shed.
Let' s reconcile them.
Not bad, eh?
Dad, if you found a precious relic from your childhood, how would it make you feel?
He was a retirement gift from my old regiment.
No, I mean something you hid like a secret treasure.
I should varnish him before autumn.
Do you want some?
Hold still.
Better now?
Shut the door!
There' s a howling gale.
It' s hardly Siberia.
I can see you' re not allergic to car fumes.
I almost coughed up my pleura last night.
Coughed up a pleura?
- What' s on the menu today, Suzanne?
- Endives au gratin.
They' il have you on your knees, you' il see.
They' re good, then?
- Depends where.
- If it' s at the toilet...
Not good!
12: 15, laughs orgasmically to attract alpha male.
He' s going to drive me berserk!
Can' t he give up?
There are plenty of other bars.
Suzanne.
- Yes.
"Au gratin" means white sauce, right?
Yes, why?
I can' t stomach it.
Like you and horse meat.
It' s not my stomach, it' s my memory.
I' d rather cook human flesh.
You' re kidding!
Suzanne, would you mind if I left early today?
What' s his name?
Dominique Bredoteau.
Hello.
Are you Dominique Bredoteau?
That' s me.
Why?
It' s about...... the petition.
Petition?
The petition to...... to canonise Lady Di.
No, thanks.
No.
Ladies and gentlemen, sorry to bother you...
I' m looking for Dominique Bredoteau for the European census.
Third floor.
Hello, kitten.
Jasmine?
What will you have?
I' m working.
I' m coming.
Do you know where I can find Dominique Bredoteau? oh, my poor dear!
Look, there he goes now.
Not Bre- do- teau.
You need a glass of mulled wine.
Come in.
This is the first time we' ve met.
I never go out on the landing.
I' m fussy about who I meet.
They' re all creeps anyway.
Here.
They call me the Glass Man, but my name is Raymond Dufayel.
- Amélie Poulain.
I' m a waitress at...
I know.
And you' ve come back empty- handed from your search for Bretodeau.
- Thank you.
I love that painting.
It' s the Luncheon of The Boating Party.
By Renoir.
I' ve painted one each year for twenty years.
The hardest part is the looks.
I sometimes feel they deliberately change their mood as soon as my back' s turned.
They look quite happy there.
They should be.
And waffles with jam for the children.
Now, what have I done with that piece of paper?
Ah, you' ve noticed my video camera at the window.
It' s a gift from my sister- in- law.
I put it there so I don' t need to wind up my clocks.
After all these years, the only person I still can' t capture is the girl with the glass of water.
She' s in the middle, yet she' s on the outside.
Maybe she' s just different from the others.
In what way?
I don' t know.
When she was little, she can' t have played much with other children.
Maybe never.
Dominique Bretodeau, 27 Rue Mouffetard.
It' s for you.
Every Tuesday morning, Dominique Bretodeau goes to buy a chicken.
He usually roasts it and has it with sauté potatoes.
After carving the legs, the breast and the wings, he loves picking the hot carcass with his fingers, starting with the oysters.
But not today.
Bretodeau won' t buy a chicken.
He' il go no further than this phone booth here.
In a flash, it all came back to him.
Federico Bahamontes winning the Tour de France in '59.
Aunt Josette' s slips.
That tragic day when he won all the marbles at break time.
The pinch, Bretodeau!
Do you understand, Bretodeau?
Cognac, please.
It' s amazing, what just happened to me.
It must be my guardian angel.
It was as if the phone booth was calling me.
It rang and rang.
Same here.
The microwave' s calling me.
I' il have another cognac.
Life' s strange.
Suddenly you' re 50.
All that' s left of your childhood fits in a little box, a little rusty box.
Have you got kids, miss?
She must be about your age.
We haven' t spoken for years.
I heard she had a child, a boy.
His name is Lucas.
I think it' s time I looked them up before I' m in a box myself.
Don' t you think?
Amélie suddenly has a strange feeling of complete harmony.
Soft light, a scent in the air, the quiet murmur of the city.
Life seems so simple and clear.
A surge of love, an urge to help mankind suddenly engulfs her.
Let me help you.
Step down. off we go!
She' s worn his coat since the day he died.
Careful.
The horse' s head on the butcher' s has lost an ear.
He has crinkly eyes.
In the bakery window there are lollipops!
Smell that.
They' re giving out melon slices.
Sugarplum ice cream!
We' re passing the pork butcher.
Spareribs, 45!
Now the cheese shop.
Picodons are 12. 90, cabecous 23. 50.
At the butcher' s a baby' s watching a dog that' s watching the chickens roasting.
Now we' re at the newspaper kiosk by the métro.
Bye.
"She was always a lonely child."
On a sparkling evening in July, while on the beaches holidaymakers relax in the new- found sun, and in Paris the sweltering crowds gaze at the first bursts of the traditional fireworks, Amélie Poulain, godmother of outcasts,
Madonna of the unloved, finally succumbs to exhaustion.
line her funeral route in silence with the measureless sorrow of newly orphaned children.
What a strange destiny for one who gave her all, yet took suchjoy in life' s simple pleasures.
Like Don Quixote, she pitted herself against the grinding windmill of all life' s miseries.
It was a losing battle that claimed her life too soon.
let her young, tired body merge with the ebb and flow of universal woe.
As she went, she felt a stab of regret for letting her father die without trying to give his stifled life the breath of air she had given to so many others.
Wait!
Pages full of dud ID photos torn up and discarded by their owners, carefully reassembled by some oddball.
Some family album!
A pack of Gauloises.
It' s so smoky in here.
- I can' t see a thing.
- More to the left.
- There?
There.
You need change.
Forget it.
- A mauresque.
A mauresque for the young man. one kir aligoté, one mauresque, and two mint sodas.
Was that prenuptial or postcoital smooching?
Is your bullshit congenital?
- Prenuptial.
You' il find Mr Right one day.
All women want to sleep on a man' s shoulder.
All of them.
All men snore after a few drinks, and I have a musical ear.
I had an operation on my nasal cavities.
I see you' re a born romantic.
I see you' ve never known true love.
It shortened my leg.
- I thought you fell off a horse.
I was in love with a trapeze artist.
They always drop you at the last minute.
He dropped me just before my act.
With me under it.
The mauresque?
Still, true love does exist.
I' m not saying it doesn' t.
I can even give you the recipe.
Leave it to simmer.
Excuse me.
- I' il go.
Haven' t you hurt enough people?
Gina can defend herself.
I mean Georgette.
Georgette? open your eyes!
She craves your attention but you only have eyes for Gina.
Poor girl!
The things she does to catch your eye!
You really must be blind.
I' m off on a date.
Bye!
Goodbye.
Whoever her new one is, he can' t be worse than that nut with his tape recorder.
He' s just in pain.
They split up two months ago.
To keep on coming here every day, he must be a masochist.
Don' t say you haven' t noticed.
Noticed what?
He always sits here, right?
Yes.
Sit down.
Sit down, Georgette.
- What can you see?
- My cigarette counter.
And nothing' s missing?
No.
Make an effort.
I don' t get it!
I' il leave you to think about it.
Good night.
Letter Arrives 30 Years Late.
A mailbag found by climbers on a glacier on Mont Blanc was part of a cargo
Iost in a plane crash in the late 1960s.
A young, pretty princess for once.
Would it be less sad if she were old and ugly? of course.
Look at Mother Teresa.
Is he still chasing Gina?
No, he' s after somebody else now.
- Anyone I know?
Funny about this glacier.
Somebody at The Two Windmills?
Not you, surely!
Not Suzanne.
Surely not!
Yes.
- Look.
- How strange.
- And here.
"Gare de Lyon."
"March 5th, Austerlitz."
Always the same blank expression.
Twelve times.
I counted.
It' s very odd.
Why keep taking your picture all over town only to throw them away?
Good ones, too.
It' s like a sort of ritual.
Maybe he' s so terrified of growing old, it' s his only consolation.
He' s dead.
Dead?
Yes.
So he uses the photo booths to remind people what he looks like.
Like faxing his portrait from the afterlife.
A dead man who' s scared of being forgotten.
At least these guys here have made it.
They' re long dead, but they' il never be forgotten.
- The girl with the glass...
Maybe she' s distracted because she' s thinking about someone.
Somebody in the picture?
No.
More likely a boy she saw somewhere, and felt an affinity with.
You mean, she' d rather imagine herself relating to someone who' s absent than build relationships with those around her?
Maybe she tries hard to fix other people' s messy lives.
What about her?
Who' il fix that?
It' s better to help people than a garden gnome.
The driver had 2. 8g of alcohol in his blood!
Makes me sick!
Talk about employing irresponsible morons!
Mr Collignon.
- You forgot your keys...
- Hold on, Amélie- mellow.
Model yourself on Lucien.
No radar will ever catch him while he' s working, will it?
You shouldn' t do that, Mr Collignon.
It' s not his fault.
True, Mrs Cauchoix!
It' s Lady Di' s.
Guess what I found in the truck.
A lingerie catalogue.
What today?
Five asparagus, or more local history?
Nothing.
Thank you.
The migraine seems to be better.
Yes, but my sciatica kept me awake all night.
- It' s ages since I saw you looking so good.
A woman without love withers like a flower without sun.
Strange weather today.
What' s so funny?
Everyone who' s come in today has given us a weather report.
We pass the time of day to forget how time passes.
We do it to keep us from talking crap.
I write crap but nobody wants to publish it.
- Another rejection?
- My thirtieth.
Isn' t your cousin a book critic?
Forget it!
Critics are like leeches sucking the blood of writers.
Is your book a love story?
No, it' s about a guy who keeps a journal.
Not about what' s happened to him, but disasters that might happen in the future.
- So he gets depressed and does nothing.
- So basically, it' s about a loafer.
I' il dedicate the manuscript to you.
He' s only doing it so you' il write off his tab!
His scribbles for my nibbles.
That' s sponsorship.
What took you so long?
Look at the time!
Somebody peed in his mother!
Without you, today' s emotions would be the scurfof yesterday' s.
"Without you, today' s emotions would be the scurf of yesterday' s."
Sorry?
Without you, today' s emotions would be the scurf of yesterday' s.
Tickets, please.
How' s work?
- You' ve already asked me that.
Yes.
You' re keeping well?
Pretty much.
I feel a change.
I had two heart attacks and had to have an abortion because I did crack while I was pregnant.
other than that, I' m fine.
Good.
Is something wrong?
Your garden gnome' s gone.
Is he back in the tool shed?
There.
No explanation.
Maybe he just wanted to see the world.
I can' t understand it.
PHoToS]
Any normal girl would call the number straightaway, meet him at a café to return the album.
Then she would know if her dream was viable.
It' s called a reality check, but it' s the last thing Amélie wants.
I say!
She' s not falling in love, is she?
... and 30 makes 50.
- Thanks, Lucien.
Yes, ladies?
- A pound of leeks.
- Two artichokes. oK.
- Where' s the boss?
He' s sleeping in the cauliflowers.
What?
He' s sleeping in the cauliflowers. oh, right.
You want me... want what?
A scratchcard, please.
How does it work?
I' il take one too, and we' il do this together.
You scratch it here...... sideways.
Nothing.
You?
No, me neither.
Unlucky at cards...
So they say!
I have to get back. oK.
See you.
Porno Video Palace.
I' m calling about the ad.
- Are you over 18?
- Shaved?
Fur pie doesn' t sell.
How' s life, Mrs Wells?
When you' ve nothing to live for...
Life' s great!
Dream on, kid!
Hello, Mr Dufayel.
Hello, Lucien.
Here' s your order, Mr Dufayel.
I hate artichokes.
You shouldn' t.
Watch this.
Take it.
That' s better.
Lucien, you' re a wizard!
All courtesy of Mr Collignon.
Mr Collignon?
It just slipped out.
Practice, Lucien!
Practice!
Repeat after me.
Collignon, down the john.
- Col...
Collignon, down the john.
- That' s it.
Your turn now.
Go on.
Collignon...
Collignon, big moron!
You can do it when you want to!
Collignon, dead and gone!
Very good!
Collignon...
- Collignon, big moron, down the john!
- That' s it!
That' s enough for today.
Lucien, stop!
Very good.
Mr Dufayel, I found this under your mat.
Still no win!
Me neither.
There' s a little...
You' re gorgeous when you blush.
Like a wild flower.
It' s my dyspepsia.
Beautiful day.
Pack of Gitanes, please.
Vive la France!
You scalded me.
Bull' s- eye!
She...
Her face was a festering mass!
Mulled wine and ginger biscuits.
Thank you.
I was too hard the other day on the girl with the glass.
Tell me about that boy she saw.
Did they meet again?
No.
They' re into different things.
Luck is like the Tour de France.
You wait, and it flashes past you.
You have to catch it while you can.
Can I help you?
I found this album in the street and I...
Nino will be so pleased!
I almost prayed to St Anthony.
Nino there?
No. on Wednesdays he works at the funfair.
How long has he had this collection?
Since I got him the job here, last year.
Before, he collected footprints.
In the daytime he took pictures of footprints in wet cement.
When we met, he was a Santa Claus.
other things like...
Whenever he heard a funny laugh, he' d tape it.
Must be hard for his girlfriend.
He never keeps them long.
Times are hard for dreamers.
Where are those coffees?
Thanks for the album.
It' s oK.
I' ve got time to take it to the funfair.
The ghost train.
I' m looking for Nino.
He doesn' t get off till seven.
- Is there no way to see him before?
- Sure.
20 francs.
See you next Wednesday.
Bring a 5 franc piece.
Want to know about her?
- You know her?
- You bet.
She put us in her shirt pocket.
Next to her breast.
Is she pretty?
Not bad.
- Beautiful.
- No, pretty.
- Beautiful.
- Pretty.
- What does she want from you?
- She' s broke.
She wants a reward for the album. or she collects photos, too.
She wants to trade us for a one- eyed man with glasses!
No, you dope!
She' s in love.
- I don' t even know her.
- Yes, you do.
Since when?
In your dreams.
It' s for you.
- Me?
Thank you.
Follow the blue arrows, Mr Quincampoix.
When the finger' s pointing to the sky, only a fool looks at the finger.
I know the stranger in the pictures.
He' s a ghost.
He' s invisible, Mr Quincampoix.
He only appears when the film is developed.
When a girl has her photo taken, he goes "oooh!" in her ear, while he gently caresses her neck.
That' s how he got caught, Mr Quincampoix.
Who are you?

To MEET ME?]
Listen to this.
"A boy of six, while his parents sleep, drives off in a pedal car.
Found on a motorway near Münster in Germany, he told the police he wanted to see the stars. "
Isn' t life beautiful, eh?
The only bug she hadn' t caught!
- Nobody' s immune.
- At least it gives me a break.
Love' s a great beautician.
What' s she like?
Small?
Dark?
Normal.
Pretty, for her type.
As for blonde or dark...... it' s hard to say, but she wasn' t a redhead.
- Forget it.
I do remember she casually asked if you had a girlfriend.
And?
I said you weren' t interested, right?
You didn' t!
What do you care?
You don' t even know her.
It' s the mystery.
- You won' t find mystery here.
A pound of nectarines, please.
These ones here are the prettiest.
Trust him.
Is he stewing a pig?
He' s studying art!
He sells leeks all day long and paints turnips all night!
The boy' s a useless vegetable.
A good prompter in each cellar window whispering cutting retorts would mean shy people had the last laugh.
Even artichokes have hearts.
Even artichokes have hearts!
Darling Mado, I miss you more and more each day.
I' m an exile in a world of dreary khaki.
I can' t sleep, can' t eat...
This camp was the biggest mistake of my life, depriving me of my beloved for five long weeks.
Your Adrien.
I dream of better times ahead.
An orange- coloured day.
Remember, my love?
Your ever- loving Adrien.
Good news, darling Mado.
Soon I' il be able to afford a car and drive home every night.
Till then, meet me on Friday and we' il go out.
Psychiatric Helpline.
Hello?
[WHERE & WHEN?]
Amélie walks into a party goods and costume shop.
At the same time, a man leaves his home at 108 Rue Lecourbe.
26 minutes later, Amélie is at the photo booth at the Gare de I' Est.
Simultaneously, the man in red shoes parks outside.
The time is exactly 11: 40.
At this precise moment, only Amélie has the key to the riddle of the mystery man.
How' s it going, Mrs Wells?
It' s always better when it' s not raining.
- This is for you.
- Me?
Dear Mrs Wells, We recently recovered a mailbag that was lost in a plane crash on October 12th 1969 on Mont Blanc.
We are forwarding the enclosed letter to your address.
Please accept our apologies for the uncustomary delay.
Jacques Grosjean, Customer Services.
I can' t sleep, can' t eat.
I think of you endlessly.
I know I' ve made the biggest mistake of my life.
I turned down that woman' s money.
If all goes well, I' il soon be able to afford a house.
I dream of better times ahead when you' il forgive me andjoin me here one orange- coloured day.
Mr Dufayel, another package for you.
Mr Dufayel, do you know what happened to the concierge?
She got a letter.
From her husband.
40 years late.
That' s a lot, isn' t it, Mr Dufayel?
I' m not big on still life, Mr Dufayel.
Then work on your thin layer.
Always!
- Mr Dufayel...
- Yes!
The papers said that there' il soon be a new star.
- So you' re into stars now?
- I saw it on TV at my mum' s, that' s why.
I don' t know if it' s true.
In America they' re going to take all the rich people' s ashes, put them in a satellite and shoot it into space.
The satellite' s going to shine for ever.
Will they do the same for her?
Give it a rest!
I can' t concentrate.
Lady Di!
Renoir.
Morning, sir.
Cambodia.
I don' t understand.
You couldn' t have done better.
- Did it work?
- It' s getting there.
Ask me again any time.
The harm' s done.
- What do you mean?
- Everybody calls me Snow White!
[The Two Windmills café from 4pm.]
- Eva?
- Yes?
Could you stand in for me at four?
Again?
What' s up with him?
Is he sulking?
- He thinks I smile too much.
- He' d rather you frowned?
With other men, yes.
Nino is late.
Amélie can only think of two possible explanations.
Firstly, that he didn' t find the photo.
Secondly, before he could assemble it, a gang of bank robbers took him hostage.
They got away, but he caused a crash.
When he came to, he' d lost his memory.
An ex- con picked him up, mistook him for a fugitive, and shipped him to Istanbul.
He met some Afghan raiders, who took him to steal some Russian warheads.
But their truck hit a mine at the border with Tajikistan.
He survived, took to the hills, and became a mujaheddin.
Amélie refuses to get upset for a guy who' il eat borscht all his life in a hat like a tea cosy.
- What can I get you?
- A coffee, please.
Here' s your coffee.
Thank you.
[Today' s menu]
He' s understood.
He' s going to put his teaspoon down, dip his finger in the sugar,
turn around slowly, and speak to me.
Is this you?
Yes, it' s you.
Another coffee?
I' m fine. - oK.
So it' s this man here, the one with with his hand up?
Yes.
Is she in love with him?
Yes.
I think it' s time she took a real risk.
She might just do that.
She' s devising a stratagem.
She' s fond of stratagems.
Yes.
In fact, she' s cowardly.
That' s why I can' t capture her look.
Dufayel' s attempts to meddle are intolerable!
If Amélie chooses to live in a dream and remain an introverted young woman, she has an absolute right to mess up her life!
What are you doing, Mr Dufayel?
For deliveries, do you keep keys to all the apartments?
one of your booths is out of order.
It seems to be jammed.
Gare de I' Est ticket hall.
- No, thanks.
Samantha?
Can you stand in for me at...
[Can you stand in for me this afternoon?]
Almost done.
The mystery man wasn' t a ghost or a man scared of ageing, but simply the repairman, a normal guy doing hisjob.
He keeps spying on me!
It' s making me sick.
Blatant female conspiracy.
Gosh, you' re tense, Georgette!
You' il need it.
Did you put this in my pocket?
- Yes, but I' m not the one...
Where is she?
She' s at her father' s.
I' d like to speak to you, but...
I finish work at six.
- Can you come back? - oK.
See you later.
Docking scheduled.
He' s very absent- minded, too.
How come?
He came back three times the same afternoon.
2: 50:
Camel coat.
- Stop it!
My rash has come back!
My rash is back.
He' s driving me nuts.
Lay off!
If she had a clear conscience, she wouldn' t be in such a state.
I' m going home.
Psychos are the last straw!
Stop smothering them!
Women need to breathe.
You let them breathe, they want a change of air.
Fresh air' s healthy.
Shut it, failure!
Failed writer, failed life...
I love the word "fail".
Failure is human destiny.
It' s gasbag time!
Failure teaches us that life is but a draft, a long rehearsal for a show that will never play.
I bet he stole that.
I do have some original ideas, but people always steal them.
A bit like your women.
Meaning?
Meaning you' d better get used to it.
Speak for yourself, you...
What?
- What' s going on?
- Nothing much.
Joseph got mad.
"Went out?"
Just like Gina.
You know who' s she' s with?
The guy with the plastic bag.
I saw their little game.
The note in the coat pocket, 4: 08.
Back he comes, and hey presto! out they go.
- I' m worried for Amélie because I like you.
- What do you mean?
By and large, the men I like are mentally unsound.
- I' d like to know more about you.
- Ask me questions.
one swallow doesn' t make...?
A swallow?
A summer.
And clothes...?
The man.
- A rat.
- Patience...?
- Is a virtue.
- Rolling stone...?
- Gathers no moss.
- It' s a sin...?
Absence makes...?
The heart grow fonder.
- Not bad.
- You collect them?
In my family, we say a man who knows his proverbs can' t be all bad.
Pretty girl from the 5th floor, listen to this!
- Do you believe in miracles?
- Not today.
You' re in for a surprise.
What if I told you that a team of climbers on Mont Blanc had found hard proof that my husband loved me?
Lucien, I need some yeast.
For Miss Amélie?
She' s baking her famous plum cake?
Collignon!
Amélie?
[I' il be back]
Go into the bedroom, Miss Poulain.
So, little Amélie, your bones aren' t made of glass.
You can take life' s knocks.
If you let this chance go by, eventually your heart will become as dry and brittle as my skeleton.
Go and get him, for pete' s sake!
[Without you, today' s emotions would be the scurf of yesterday' s]
International airport.
September 28th 1997.
It is exactly 11am.
At the funfair, near the ghost train, the marshmallow twister is twisting.
Félix Lerbier learns there are more links in his brain than atoms in the universe.
Meanwhile, at the Sacré Cour, the nuns are practising their backhand.
The temperature is 24oC, humidity 70%, atmospheric pressure 999 millibars.

# Somebody' s gonna make a happy trip tonight #
# While the moon is bright #
# He' s gonna have a bag of crazy toys #
# To give to the girls and boys #
# So dig #

Excuse me.
# Come a- callin 'when it snows the most #
# Cats are sleepin 'warm as toast #
# And you gonna flip when old Saint Nick #
# Lays a lick on the peppermint stick #
Sorry.
- I' m sorry.
- Do you want these?
Please.
- You go ahead.
It' s the last one.
Uh, miss, do you have another pair of these black cashmere gloves?
- Whatever' s out is what we have.
- You don' t have a stockroom?
- No.
No.
We don' t have an attic either.
Um, listen, you take 'em.
I don' t need 'em.
- No, no, no.
I -- - Please.
I insist.
- Take them.
Oh!
- Excuse me, sir.
These are ours.
- Yeah?
Oh.
How come?
They' re just sort of hanging there, sleeping with their little price tag on.
- We were just discussing them, all right?
- Well, I have news for you.
You can go on discussing them long after I' ve paid for them.
- Calm down, all right?
- Calm down?
It' s five days before Christmas.
He' s asking me to calm down.
Well, these were meant to be a very special gift for someone.
- Yeah, we put quite a lot of thought into those.
- Isn' t that right?
- Well, who were they for?
- My boyfriend.
- My girlfriend.
- Her boyfriend.
- His girlfriend.
One pair of gloves for two people?
- This is hard to explain.
- Try.
All right.
Go ahead.
Uh, well, he is at the present time my boyfriend.
- He will be -- - She will be --
Do you understand?
That didn' t really work out.
- No, but Merry Christmas anyway.
- Thank you very much.
Well, you earned these.
That was quick on your feet.
It was a team effort.
- Yeah, it was.
It was.
- Well --
# Have a yule that' s cool ##
They' re ready for you guys.
Thank you.
I don' t know what you said to that guy makes any sense.
- But I think we scared the be jesus out of him.
- You were pretty fierce.
This will work, though.
This is quite a coffee.
But I' m serious about the check.
It' s the least I can do.
Well, thank you, but, see, now I have to go find something else for my girlfriend.
- Oh, they were for your girlfriend.
- Yes, they were.
- Oh, I can' t accept them then.
- Well, you have to.
Otherwise you won' t treat.
Really.
This is the ultimate blend to drink.
- Where did you find this place?
- I first came in because of the name.
- Serendipity.
It' s one of my favorite words.
- It is?
Why?
'Cause it' s such a nice sound for what it means: a fortunate accident.
- Except I don' t really believe in accidents.
- I think fate' s behind everything.
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah.
- Fate' s behind everything?
- I think so.
- Everything' s predestined?
- We don' t have any choice at all?
- I thinkwe make our own decisions.
I just think that fate sends us little signs, and it' s how we read the signs that determines whether we' re happy or not.
- Little signals.
- Yeah.
Fortunate accidents.
Lucky discoveries.
Columbus in America.
- Yeah, or Fleming discovering penicillin.
- Penicillin.
- Fleming is his name?
- Yes.
Or "Jonathan and the Gloves."
- I don' t know that one.
- You don' t know that story?
It' s an old folk tale classic.
Our hero, Jonathan, goes out in search of black gloves.
And in a perfect act of "serendipiocity" or "serendipaciousness," he runs into a beautiful, attractive English girl with a boyfriend.
You have a boyfriend, right?
- Yeah, I do.
- That' s what I thought.
- And you have the glove lady.
- Yes, I do.
- Mm- hmm.
- It was a very nice time.
- Well, I hope you enjoy the gloves you bought yourself.
- Oh, I' m sure I will.
I usually appreciate my own thoughtfulness.
- Golfclubs.
- Oh.
So you' re gonna meet your boyfriend now or what?
No, I think he' s probably out doing what you' re doing.
Getting a crush on someone else' s girlfriend?
No, I' m sorry.
I just meant to say I had a really great time.
You know, maybe you should give me your phone number, you know, just in case.
- In case of what?
- You know, in case of life.
I just had a great time, and I' d never be able to find you again.
Well, if we' re meant to meet again, then we' il meet again.
It' s just not the right time now.
Maybe we were supposed to meet on British time and we' re five hours too early.
Come on.
I don' t even know your name.
My name is Jonathan.
- Does that make you wanna tell me something?
- Yeah, it does.
Merry Christmas, Jonathan.
And thanks.
That' s it?
# I can feel my heart #
- Oh, Jesus, I' m sorry about that. - # And it' s about to burst #
# I try to clean it up #
# But I just get worse #
# Wish I could fall #
# On a night like this # - # Into your loving arms # - I think I left a scarf.
Nothing down here.
Why don' t you go upstairs?
- Maybe it' s still there.
- Thank you.
# I thought I saw your face #
# In the evening sky #
# On a lonesome cloud #
# That was drifting by #
# I wish I could fall #
# On a night like this #
# Into your loving arms ##
Hey.
Hey.
Let' s go do something.
All right.
What you wanna do?
I don' t care.
All right.
Come on.
Now, promise me you' re not just visiting here for a week... or marrying somebody to get a green card or on parole.
None of the above.
You?
Proud U. S. citizen.
No criminal record.
Well, tell me, uh, what do you miss most about Mother England?
I miss my mom terribly.
If I were her, I' d miss you too.
Okay.
Favorite movie.
- The correct answer is Cool Hand Luke.
- I' ve never seen it.
Oh, come on.
You' ve never seen Cool Hand Luke?
Paul Newman?
Come on!
"Failure to communicate."
Sadistic cop in sunglasses with no name.
Reminds me of you in that way.
Um, favorite New York moment.
This one' s climbing the charts.
I' m flattered.
Is there anything else you need to know about me?
Favorite sexual position?
That' s my favorite too.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Did you hurt yourself?
Yes.
- You did?
- Ouch.
- Oh, Jesus.
That' s a deep, deep gash.
- Gaping.
What?
We' il fix that right up.
There you go.
What?
Oh, you' re looking at my freckles.
It' s the curse of the English, I' m afraid.
Fair skin and bad teeth.
No, you have great teeth.
Those aren' t just freckles.
If you look closely, you can see Cassiopeia.
- What?
- Right there.
Hold on a minute.
Okay.
All right, here' s the story.
A long time ago in Ethiopia, there was this queen named Cassiopeia... who thought she was the most beautiful woman in the entire world, and there wasn' t anybody in the kingdom who wasn' t offended... by this woman' s relentless vanity.
And then one day, she really screwed up and offended the gods.
She crossed the line.
But anyway, Poseidon, the sea god, punished Cassiopeia... by placing her in the heavens upside down on her throne, stuck for eternity with her skirt around her shoulders... and all the blood rushing to her head.
And now she' s just a constellation in the sky, a bunch of English freckles in the shape of a throne.
So she made one tragic mistake.
And paid for eternity.
Correct.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Legible, legible.
- I can' t believe I' m doing this.
- Now, please, please.
Let fate take its proper course.
- That was an accident.
Write down that again, please.
- I can' t.
That was a sign.
Fate' s telling us to back off.
If fate didn' t want us to be together, then why did we meet tonight, huh?
- Gotcha.
- Well, I don' t know.
- But it' s not an exact science.
It' s a feeling.
- Well, what if you' re wrong?
What if it' s all in our hands and we just walk away?
No names, no phone numbers, nothing.
What do you think' s gonna happen?
- right to your doorstep?
- Do you know that' s the best idea you' re had all night?
- What' s the best -- - Here you go.
Write your name and number down.
- On a $5. 00 bill?
Just do it.
You are a strange and interesting woman.
Now what?
Wait there.
What the hell was that?
When that $5. 00 bill makes it back into my hands, I' il be able to call you.
And when you hear my voice on the other end, then you' il believe in fate, won' t you? ##
- What do you mean?
Well, we have to send something out in the universe with your name on it, don' t we?
Isn' t that the only fair thing?
- That is the only fair thing.
Ooh.
I have a really good idea.
- What?
- Okay.
- That' s a lot of tuba.
Yeah.
I' m gonna write my name and number inside this book.
And then first thing tomorrow morning, I' il sell it to a used book store.
Which one?
You' re not gonna tell me.
Why not?
Well, now, every time you go past an old book store, you' re gonna have to go inside to see if it' s there.
This is just wrong.
You don' t just have the most incredible night of your life... with a perfect stranger and then leave it all to chance, do ya?
- Do ya?
- Come with me a second.
What, we' re gonna get a room?
I' m kidding.
But I wanna know you more.
- Come on.
Where are we going?
- Okay.
- Now, you stay here.
- Okay.
- No, stay here.
Don' t make me come over there.
- Okay.
All right, if we both randomly pick the same floor, we' re meant to be together now.
You' re insane.
Come on.
Okay, get in.
Take a breath, and then when the door closes, hit a button.
- I don' t understand this.
- You don' t have to understand.
You just have to have faith.
Faith in what?
Destiny.
It' s Sara.
My name' s Sara.
And here it is.
See?
You were right.
- Uh -- - Let' s go, buddy.
- We' re going up here.
- Oh, that' s okay.
Josh likes to ride either way.
- [Growling]
Don' t do that!
Don' t touch those!
Hey, calm down.
He' s just a kid.
- [Hisses]
- We' re going again.
- Thank you.
Where is she?
Is she here?
I don' t think so.
Come on, Josh.
Let' s go, buddy.
Okay, stay alert.
- Is she here?
- No, not here.
Back in the elevator.
- She' s not here?
- Come on!
Move it!
Come on, boy!
- [Dog Barks]
Hey, Sara.
I' m sorry.
- Hey.
I' m sorry.
- What?
I' m sorry.
[Man]
I usually have to beg to be a part of weddings.
And if I do get into the wedding, of course they postponed it, and it' s overseas somewhere, and they' ve canceled my passport, and I can' t be a part of it, and it' s ridiculous and awkward and horrible.
So thank you.
I take this very seriously.
It' s a gift to be the best man.
They say that once in your lifetime, someone comes along... whom you' re absolutely meant to be with.
Everything feels great, stars are aligned, body and spirit are in balance.
Formy friend Jonathan Trager, that person was me.
But as you know, Jonny and I were simpatico.
We were brothers from another mother.
We were friends since freshman year.
I watched him go out with woman after woman, and he' d always come crawling -- he would come crawling back to me.
- It was embarrassing.
- You loved it.
But then one night he came home and things were different.
His adole scent dream of becoming a documentary filmmaker was a thing of the past.
- Thank God.
- He hardly even responded... to my playful yet tormented flicks of my finger... against the soft part of his skull as he studied for finals.
And that is because he had found her.
The woman he was meant to be with.
And if anyone is qualified... to know when he met his soul mate, it would be me, his first wife.
She' s smart, she' s funny, she' s beautiful.
In short, she' s the kind of woman that any man would dream about.
And I think we all have.
So it is with sadness... and fond, fond memories... that I raise my glass... to the new Mrs. Jonathan Trager.
I' il tell you what.
I' il tell you something.
I can' t imagine a more perfect woman than Halley.
Cheers to both of you.
- How drunk is he on a scale of one to ten?
- Twelve.
- I don' t know.
I don' t think I' ve ever seen them fight.
- Me neither.
Must be a bitch on their sex life.
We have a pomegranate souffle which is amazing, which is different than the sorbet.
Listen, we' d love to join you guys, but Courtney has to wake up, so I got to be good.
Halley, listen to me.
It' s not too late to back out.
- Good night, Dean.
- And I' m at 166th and --
Good night, Courtney.
Mama, you don' t want to see this.
I need -- I need to snuggle.
- I' m gonna go sleep it off.
Listen, you' re wonderful.
- Good night.
- You know what?
You need me.
- Take care.
Come on, hon.
You guys, listen, I hate to tell you, but I gotta go home too.
I have to.
I gotta get up at 8: 00 in the morning.
My day is crazy tomorrow.
- He doesn' t want to come.
He doesn' t have to come.
- I' il see you in about 20 hours.
- Bye- bye, dear.
- I love you, son.
- Night- night.
- George.
- Take care.
You okay?
- You better be up later.
- Yeah, why?
- Uh- huh? - and climb into bed, - Uh- huh? act like we just got over a terrible fight.
See you later now.
Reading is good for you.
Knowledge.
Reading?
- Hold on, hold on.
Listen, listen.
- I read it a long time ago.
- I' il throw in the screenplay to The Bridges of Madison County.
- I saw the movie.
It was great.
Okay, and --
I mean -- I mean, I did nothing.
I -- I just let her walk out of the party and I didn' t say anything to her.
And now she' s gone forever.
I mean, she was my soul mate.
Kenny, I honestly think it' s dangerous to use the term "soul mate."
like fate or destiny.
I think holding on to beliefs like that stops us doing the real work.
I think you' il find there are many, many people out there you could easily be happy with.
You truly believe all that, Sara?
Yeah.
I really do.
- There you go.
- Thanks.

Ow!
Ow!
- I got it.
I got it.
- Ow, ow.
Ow!
- I got it.
Okay, you' re not gonna read into this, right, Sara?
- I mean, it' s just an accident, nothing more.
God.
We' il get it refitted.
It' s beautiful.
I love it.
You- You get changed.
I' m gonna call Ryan, tell him you said yes.
- Why?
Was he worried?
About the tour.
He' s hoping to fit the honeymoon into the schedule.
How does Bora Bora sound?
Very... sexy- sexy?

Now, if you' re a golfer on a one- hour lunch break, you' d use that time up just getting to the nearest course out of Manhattan.
All this was a long overdue solution.
Formerly a dilapidated pier and converted just five years ago, the range offers the inhabitants of this concrete jungle... the chance to keep their drives straight, their short games accurate... and most of all, brings the joys and frustrations of golf... back to city folk.
This is Nick Roberts, ESPN News, New York City.
Superb, Nick.
We got it.
Thank you.
- Artie, I gotta run, okay?
- What about the B- roll shot?
Paging Sara Lawson.
- Please come to the frontdesk.
- Could you come back and get the B- roll on Friday?
- Yeah.
Whatever you say, boss.
- Thank you, sir.
Hi.
Sorry I' m late.
- How are you?
You' re down at position number two.
Oh, right.
Bad golfers all the way down there, right?
Dude, take off.
We got it.
Well, hello, Mr. Marrying Man.
- Hi.
Uh, where' s Lauren?
- Oh, Lauren took the day off.
My name is Sara and I' m gonna cut your hair today.
I' m not thrilled with having that "just cut hair" look for my own wedding, so --
- I' il just take a little bit off.
- I gotta live with these pictures the rest of my life.
- Just a little bit.
- Please, you know, uh --
# It' s you #
# And me forever #
# Sara, smile # Whoo!
# Won' t you smile a while for me #
Forget Charles Street.
- Mm- hmm. - # Sara ##
[Jonathan]
I' m telling you, I keep running into her.
I keep finding it.
It keeps happening.
She was at the golfrange.
All right?
Then I gotta leave 'cause Sara' s gonna cut my hair,
And the guy in the taxi, he' s serenading me, "Sara."
I' m telling you, the universe keeps revealing her to me,
- screwing with my head.
- You' re getting married in three days.
- That' s my point.
- It' s entirely duplicitous.
Think about it.
- just to search for some pipe dream?
- Just hear me out, man.
I' m sure that I love Halley, all right?
And maybe every time you fall in love with somebody, it' s a completely different experience.
So it' s a mistake to compare them.
All right.
It' s like Halley is The Godfather, Partil.
She' s what?
Godfather, Partil.
That was an incredible movie.
Might be better than the original.
All right?
But no matter how much you love The Godfather, Partil, you still have to see the original... to understand and appreciate the sequel, don' tya?
Come on.
Is it too much to ask from my oldest friend to help me out?
- You' ve already got the fairy- tale marriage.
- I' m the best man.
You work in the biggest newspaper in the world.
Help me find her.
Let me tell you something.
Contrary to popular New York myth, the Times is not omniscient.
I need a social security number.
- If we find the book -- - It- It- It' s a dead end.
You know that.
- Unless we search every book store in New York.
- You did that.
- Years ago.
Do you remember?
- Maybe I missed a store.
- Maybe somebody bought it and sold it back.
- You know what?
I don' t want any part of this.
All right?
Maybe I am just getting cold feet.
I' m telling you right now, British women do not age well.
You know, I mean, years ago, yes, she was a luscious treat.
You know, she probably looked like, you know, Baby Spice.
But now she could look like --
Old Spice.
- It' s a great haircut.
Thanks.
- Tell me you love me.
- I love you.
- Tell me something romantic.
- Like what?
I don' t know.
Like... how I' m the only girl in the entire universe meant for you.
Oh, my God, the dinner!
By the way, I emptied your closet.
We gotta pack for the honeymoon.
- God, I hate this building.
Shut up!
Don' t hit it with the thing.
- [Beeping Continues]
- What?
I' m gonna go yell at the super.
I don' t understand why this is going off.
- You said last week it would be fine.
- Hey, Jon.
This place looks like a disaster area.
- Thanks, Gerald.
- Gerald, it' s in here.
I gotta get going.
Coming!
Come on!
I wanna see!
I wanna see!
I thought you wanted a round- cut diamond.
- Why?
When did I say that?
- I' m not exactly sure.
- But when we were younger, I think.
- Oh, God.
When I was younger, I was gonna marry Boris Becker, wasn' t I?
- Hey, guys.
What did you think?
- Hey!
Well, I mean, was that last song really inspired by my sister?
Every artist needs his muse.
- Who wants to hear the good news?
- Hey, I pay you for the good news.
No.
You pay me to keep away the bad news.
- Bring it on.
- Lars' dates in Stockholm sold out in eight hours.
That means we' re gonna have to add some more shows.
Sorry.
I don' t wanna spoil anyone' s party, but Lars and I have already set the dates for our honeymoon and our wedding, and I' ve told my patients when I' m going.
Well, baby, your patients can do without you for a couple weeks.
He' s right, Sara.
I mean, a couple of extra weeks in Europe aren' t gonna kill you.
'cause she wants us to house- sit for you guys.
Yeah, thank you.
I was going to ask her when she was drunk.
- Actually, that' s a great idea.
- Yes!
Come on, Kip.
Let' s get out of here before Sara changes Lars' mind.
- I said something wrong?
I' ve just got a very detailed schedule... and my patients are important too.
- I don' t like changing the dates at the last minute.
- Excuse me.
I' m sorry.
But I really need you to approve these T- shirt designs forAustralia.
- Oh, no problem.
- You don' t mind, do you?
- Can we do this later?
- Yeah.
She don' t mind.
That' s chamomile for you ladies.
- Nice and hot.
Very good.
- Thanks.
Sara, it was a movie poster.
It' s no big deal.
It' s peculiar though, right?
Don' t you think?
like horoscopes and feng shui and all the crap.
Eve, for someone who owns a New Age store, you are alarmingly earthbound.
Oh, yeah?
And for a shrink- in- training, you are a little bit crazy.
- I' il tell you that much.
Excuse me.
- Do you carry the Casanova candle?
- As a matter of fact, we do.
Check on the shelf across from the Caligula incense.
And they' re on sale, so today' s your lucky day.
Great.
You see, that is what happens... when people get hooked on the New Age life.
They end up sitting at home burning candles for Mr. Right... when Mr. Good Enough For Right Now is waiting at the corner bar.
- Hi.
Oh, yeah.
She' s a pain in the ass.
- And I gotta find her.
- I' ve been here three years, so this is --
Yeah, I understand.
But your computer system has been here for a long time.
- I think -- I think you' re just wasting my time, sir.
- No, no.
- Here' s the thing.
- There' s nothing I can do.
- It' s very crucial.
You cannot come over...
- to this side of the counter.
- All right.
- Please don' t cross this line.
Thank you.
- All I really need... is if you can enter this account number in the computer...
- and just tell me her name.
- Oh, I see.
When you put it that way, no.
- Would 20 bucks help?
- It might if I was a health inspector.
- Listen, this is really important.
- Oh, boy, did it again.
Crossed the line.
You have to remain on the other side of the register.
I don' t wanna say it again.
Remain on that side.
Thank you.
Let' s bottom- line this, huh?
What' s it gonna take?
I have to have the name.
Well, I was a little short on myweekly sales draw.
- Were you?
- I' m just mentioning.
Okay.
Um, I' m going to, uh -- [Muttering]
- Look where my feet are.
Allright?
- Lovely choice, sir.
- Thank you.
Account number was 029351 --
I thought you said you were gonna help with my weekly draw.
We' re still 700 short. - $700?
That' s extortion.
- 700.
That' s good salesmanship, sir.
What do I need?
Ring it up.
- Well, we have a purple tie.
- Mm- hmm.
I look like a magician.
All right, you horrible little man.
I bought the entire spring line.
Okay, you happy?
- Now, look her up.
- I already did.
It was a dead account.
There' s no information in our computers.
- You give me that?
- Hey, chase me.
- Chase you?
What?
Are you insane?
- Don' t cross the line!
- You crossed the line!
- Stop saying that or I will cut you!
Now, you better find a way to help me right now!
- I can suggest another option.
- Suggest it fast.
When our customers apply for a credit card, the hard copies go to our storage facility in Queens.
All you need is the account number, which you already have, and you can find her application.
However, you need an employee to get you in.
You need an employee... to get you in.
Crocodile.
Hal.
Halley.
A natural.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Really natural.
Cut, cut, cut.
- What' s the problem?
The problem is you can' t fend off an army of blood thirsty Vikings with a shehnai.
- It' s illogical.
- No, see -- No, no.
You' re lulling them into submission with the music.
"Mystic Surrender."
You don' t think he looks like he hates the music?
Hey.
Hey, baby.
- Now, this guy, he' s- he' s like Alec Guinness.
Star Wars.
All right, right here, what are they doing?
What' s their attitude?
- Whatare they thinking?
- They' re in awe and speechless.
And they' re just grateful.
Underpaid.
Why don' t they ask me to stay in the village and have a feast?
Yeah.
Sara, hey.
- Can we talk for a sec?
- Sure.
Okay, yeah, I' m going to split, guys.
Lars, I' il tell you what.
I' m gonna talk to the director... and I' m gonna have him tweak that whole section.
- It' il be fine.
It' il be fine.
- Tell him about the feast.
- What' s going on?
- I lost my keys yesterday.
- Oh, that' s a drag.
- And I' ve just found them in the freezer.
I don' t get it.
Is that a joke?
No, Lars, it' s not a joke.
I feel like I' m losing my mind.
It' s the wedding plans and the tour and my patients.
It' s just a bit too much to deal with.
We' re leaving for Toronto in the morning,
- so don' t fall apart on me now.
- I know, I know, I know.
And that' s why I think I need a little break.
What do you mean, a little break?
No, not that kind of little break.
I just mean a weekend away to recharge my batteries and clear my head.
Hey, this has nothing to do with the other night.
I just need this.
I need it for me.
But I won' t go unless you say it' s okay.
- It' s okay.
- Thank you.
Okay.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Oh, I don' t know.
New York, maybe.
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, my God.
Are you serious?
Get out of town.
Yeah, that' s the idea.
- Thanks.
Talk to you soon.
- Okay.
This is unbelievable.
Sara, really, this is way too generous of you.
Oh, come on.
Can' t a girl do something nice for her friend on her birthday?
There' s no ulterior motives?
Well, yeah.
I' m getting married in a week and I' d just like to have one last fling... with my best friend before I walk down the aisle.
- It' s so sweet.
But, you know, you' re really not my type.
- Oh, thanks.
- We' re going to New York?
- Yeah.
Yea!

Hey!
Excuse me.
- Why so tense?
- Because you' re freaking me out, all right?
- Is there another space you can be in?
Excusez- moi.
- Uh- huh.
- And what is it you do?
Why, my sales clerk friend, I happen to write for a little publication.
Maybe you' ve heard of it.
It' s called the New York Times.
- Yeah.
- [Phone Ringing]
Hello.
Who?
Dean?
And who may I say is calling?
Huh?
Hang on.
Your editor.
Hi.
No.
Uh --
Didn' t write that one either.
Uh, with all due respect, sir, they' il all still be dead tomorrow.
Okay.
Thank you.
Bye- bye.
- You write for the obituaries.
- Absolutely.
Yeah.
- You must be very proud.
I' m the one with the last word.
- Not tonight.
I don' t think so.
Absolutely.
- Fat chance.
Last line.
- Still talking.
Yeah, right here.
I don' t know.
I don' t know.
My eyes are killing me.
- Tell me these numbers match.
- I' il tell you.
- Let me see.
- Don' t do that.
- Ah- ah!
- Is it 0293?
0293.
Congratulations.
- You got it?
- I think you found her.
Too bad the last name' s completely smudged out, though.
Well, it' s his fault.
It was his thumb.
When he grabbed it, his thumb went right across the name.
Completely.
I' m kidding.
It was smudged in my hand.
- It' s just a little joke.
That' s carbon paper for you.
I guess that' s why America rejected it.
- What' s that address?
- That' s seven years ago, man.
So go to the building leasing office... and you' il find out who lived there seven years ago.
It ain' t rocket science.
Thank you.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Where to?
- Yeah, where are we going?
- Uh, okay, take us... anywhere in New York.
- Excuse me?
Anywhere.
Wherever you feel like going.
- That' s not a destination, lady.
- Wait.
You didn' t make reservations?
- Um, okay, Eve, please don' t get mad at me.
Oh, no.
I cannot believe this.
I need a borough here, ladies.
I was gonna tell you when we got on the plane.
You know what?
That' s really sneaky of you, Sara.
- I' m not a bloody psychic.
- Eve, wait!
Wait!
- Eve.
Eve!
- You tricked me.
I knew you wouldn' t come if I told you the truth.
I needed my best friend with me.
What are you doing, Sara?
Honestly, Sara, I don' t understand you anymore, okay?
Please, tell me something.
Tell me anything that makes just a little bit of sense.
I' ve just spent the entire flight... staring into the sky, thinking.
I met a million and a half hours ago.
A guy I don' t even remember, except for this... vague picture I have inside my head.
It was just a few seconds.
A fragment, really.
And it was like... in that moment, the whole universe existed just to bring us together.
That' s why I' m here.
That' s why I' m gonna let fate take me wherever it wants to go.
Because when all this is over, at least I' m never gonna have to think of him ever again.
Let' s just pray he' s a bald fascist... who picks his nose and wipes it under the car seat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Could you hold on?
Where are you going?
You better be buying me one frigging big birthday cake, that' s all I gotta say.
Could I get your destination, please?
- The Waldorf, I guess.
- Finally she gets it.
Okay, we are going... that way.
And I' m gonna follow.
You can do it yourself.
Just open up the computer and look into it.
- I' m not even sure that I can give you this information.
- If you can' t, why can' t you?
Because I' m just a temp, okay?
I don' t know the rules.
Couple of months out of college, you' re acting like you' re part of the establishment.
No, no, no, no, no -- What about privacy law, huh?
Forget about privacy laws.
You know what privacy laws do?
- No.
- They protect millionaires.
Do you know who those are?
- Who?
- Tell him who they are.
- Tell him.
- Kids your age.
Pimple- faced college dropouts who have made unhealthy sums of money... forming Internet companies that create no concrete products, provide no viable services and still manage to generate profits... for all of its lazy, day- trading, son- of- a- bitch shareholders.
Meanwhile, as a tortured member of the disenfranchised proletariat, you find some altruistic need to protect these digital plantation owners?
Wow.
Come on.
Come on.
- You guys want the tenant on record in 1994?
- December, to be exact.
- There' s your tenant.
- Sebastian Mig- non?
No.
Mignon.
It' s French.
No, we' re looking for someone named Sara.
You got the right one?
- Maybe he was her boyfriend.
- Thanks.
- You did the right thing.
Really, you did.
- Goodwork, pal.
You got it.
M- I- G- N- O- N.
You got it?
There you go.
- Thank you so much, Sally.
You gotta love her.
- Where is he?
- Brooklyn.
- Okay, let' s, uh -- let' s grab a subway.
Wait a minute.
Aren' t you forgetting about something?
- What?
- Wedding rehearsal.
Bachelor party.
- Plenty of time.
Come on.
- You sure?
- Yes.
Come on.
- [Barks]
Prada!
Oh, my God!
Ooh!
Prada!
Ooh, I love this stuff.
- That' s $20.
- Twenty bucks?
Eve, that' s a horrific knockoff.
Yours says "Prado."
Yeah?
I can buy a little Magic Marker and fix that.
I' il take it.
Twenty bucks?
Right back here.
Here you go.
Two buckets of balls for the price of one at the Chelsea Piers today.
- So where are we going to now?
- I don' t know.
- Lady, lady, you' re a golfer?
- I feel like I feel something.
- Two for the price of one.
- Right where I' m standing.
Who are you?
Can you believe that?
Two bucket of -- Whoa!
- Will you help me up, ma' am?
Yeah, yeah, help me up.
- Are you okay?
- Is the ball okay?
- Yeah, the back of the head.
Is that all right?
Goodness gracious.
- I' m all right.
Can you get the flyers?
- Here you go.
- Taxi!
- Sara!
They should make pills for this.
He' s gotta be here.
He' s got to be here.
I can feel it.
- Excuse me.
Miss?
- Yeah?
- Oh.
Sorry.
This is Nick Roberts, ESPN News, New York City.
- Oh!
Do you know who plays golf?.
Guys who are too fat to play tennis.
Like that guy.
Well, this is a special occasion.
After all, how many times in your life is your son gonna get married?
Well said.
- You wanna know why I love this game?
- No.
Why?
I' il tell ya.
You can take years off from playing and still come back strong.
Well, me, I haven' t played in over five years.
You' re kidding.
- Are you all right?
- I' m okay.
- Sorry up there.
- Eve, look out!
- Go.
- Oh, my God, I' m so sorry.
I' m, so sorr -- Are you okay?
Please say something.
Say something.
I think I swallowed a filling.
Thank you for letting us in.
Now, Mr. Mignon, we have an odd and some what personal question to ask you.
Mignon.
Mr. Mignon.
Mignon.
Like the meat.
Mr. Mignon, a few years ago, did you live with a girl, first name Sara?
- girl.
- Oui.
- Do you know where we can locate this individual?
- Do you remember her last name?
- No.
Oh, come on.
You don' t even remember the last name of your ex- girlfriend?
- I find that hard to believe.
- You don' t understand anything.
She was not my girlfriend.
She was just, uh, a roommate.
She stayed with me for a very short period of time.
- She was placed with me by -- - A roommate finder' s service?
Oui.
She stayed with me with her boyfriend for a few months --
- I don' t care about him.
- And then he moved out very quickly.
And at the end of the year, she moved out too.
Yeah, but did she leave anything behind, maybe with her last name on it, like a receipt, a bill?
- Like a piece of luggage?
No, no.
Anything would help, really.
Anything.
I remember she sat on me.
She -- She sat on you?
She sat on me for a while.
I found her... inspiring.
I guess that is why I started painting her in the first place.
She sat for you.
I' m sorry.
That is what I said.
- That' s what he said.
- That' s what I said.
Clearly.
Do you happen to have the painting?
Hey, now you' re gonna see what it' s all about.
You know, you see her face.
Yeah.
This is her, yes?
Yeah, sure.
Around the eyes a little.
I mean, I' m definitely getting the British thing, you know, with the crown and the scepter.
- Do you have a name for the roommate finder' s service?
- They would have the information.
No, I do not.
But if it helps, I do remember where the service was located.
- Absolutely!
Where?
Where?
- Manhattan.
- Where in Manhattan, Mr. Mignon?
On 60thStreet.
- East side or west side?
- It was just next to that -- on the left of that splendid little patisserie,
Serendipity.
That' sit.
Get -- Get ready.
Happy birthday.
It' s on the house.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Oh, I' m a god- awful friend.
- No, you will be if you sing.
Eve, thanks so much for coming with me.
You' re welcome.
Sara, you know, it' s a wonderful thought.
The idea that all of life, that every single event is part of some master plan... designed to lead us to our universal soul mate.
But if that' s really true, then what' s the point of living?
Or making decisions?
Hell, why should we even get out of bed in the morning?
For the cake?
Not for cake.
So that you make mistakes.
Mistakes like this trip.
And if you' re smart enough, you learn from your mistakes.
You figure it out.
You- You think.
You realize that life isn' t some elaborate stage play with directions for the actors.
Life' s a mess, Sara.
It' s- It' s chaos personified.
I have to give it all up now, don' t I?
Sara, you have a fiance who, despite his weird Eastern music, which we hope is just a phase, let' s hope,
It' s growing up.
Let' s get out of here.
Yeah.
- Here' s one.
- Ooh, catch it.
- It' s a bridal shop.
- Oh, my God.
The irony.
- Wait right here.
I' il be right back.
- Why?
- Time, please?
- Uh, about 7: 30.
Right.
Right.
They moved downtown.
If we get lucky with traffic, we can still hit it.
- What time is rehearsal?
- Can' t do it.
- Taxi!
- It' s over, man.
What?
- What are you talking about?
- How can I ignore that?
"Bless the goddamn bride"?
- What?
- It can' t get any more clearer than this.
I' m not supposed to be doing this.
It' s not in the cards.
Hey, it' s another one of your clues, man.
Let' s talk about it in the cab...
- on the way over.
It' s a sign.
- What' s the difference?
- A clue is what a detective uses to find a suspect.
The receipt, the warehouse, that French guy -- those are clues.
This is a sign.
Me never finding the book, that' s a sign.
Sara never finding the $5. 00 bill, that' s a sign.
How could something not happening be a sign?
Maybe the absence of signs is a sign.
Isn' t it?
That' s lucid.
Maybe there is no fate.
And if there is, it' s not working for me.
You know, it' s not actually supposed to end this way, by the way.
We' re supposed to pull the curtain and see the wizard, all right?
- Get to the end of the river.
- This is the end of the river.
My wedding rehearsal... starts in less than an hour.
- Let me ask you something here.
If Sara were here right now, poof, came down, what would she tell you to do?
She would tell me to run, not walk to the Waldorf... because all the signs point to me getting married.
Look.
Wedding dress.
Lots of white.
- I hate to state the obvious -- - State it.
If you don' t do this, you may never find out who Sara is.
Maybe I was never supposed to.
Maybe all this is just a maze... designed to lead me directly back to where I started.
Which is getting married.
They should make pills for this.
- Halley?
- Oh, my God.
Eve!
What a crazy coincidence!
- Good.
- Oh, my God.
Sara, can you believe... that I was Halley' s R. A. in college?
Isn' t that funny?
Oh, I' m sorry.
This is Sara.
- Hi.
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.
Oh, my gosh.
What' s it been, like eight or nine years?
Eve was, uh -- I went to B. U. with Eve.
- Well, isn' t that wonderful?
- Yeah.
How about that?
So what are you doing here?
- I' m getting married tomorrow.
- You are?
Congratulations.
- Congratulations.
- Wow!
- Thanks.
- In this hotel?
Yeah, at noon.
We' re going to rehearsal.
Why don' t you come watch?
- Okay, sure.
I would love to come and watch.
And you can bring your... partner if you want.
- Oh!
- Oh!
No, no.
I have to go upstairs and call my fiance -- who' s a man.
You must be very proud.
- Okay, so have a good one.
I' il see you later.
- Okay, good.
Good- bye, my sweet lesbian lady lover.
I' m just kidding.
It' s just a joke between us.
Lars?
What are you doing?
- How did you know where I was?
- Intuition.
Really?
No.
I went through the New York Hotel Guide.
I started with "Z."
Sara, I missed you so much.
I' m sorry.
I don' t blame you for running away.
I was so... focused on the album, the video.
I, Jonathan, take you, Halley, to be my wife, and I promise to love and sustain you... in the bond of marriage from this day forward.
And obviously, Jonathan, you' il be looking at Halley.
- And that' s when the actual ceremony will conclude.
- Excuse me.
I need some help over here.
And then -- then you' re married.
Hal, who' s that girl over there?
- Oh.
Okay, everyone, that' s a wrap.
And now make sure to be here tomorrow morning at 9: 00 sharp for pictures.
We' re late.
- You mean "exotic dancers."
- No, no.
I mean "strippers."
- The women who take off everything.
- I' il see you men at 9: 00.
But remember, I promised Judy I' d be home by 10: 00.
Fantastic.
It gives you an hour to get crazy.
Let' s get into it.
Before you take Jon and Dad off to your male- bonding ritual, I need to talk to him.
Beautiful bride.
I' il be in the cab.
- Hi.
- I want you to meet Jon.
- Hi.
It' s so nice to meet you.
- I would love for you to come tomorrow.
- We' d feel terrible if you didn' t.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- That' s so sweet.
It' s tomorrow at noon?
Yeah, and you can bring your friend if you want.
- Okay.
I' il be there.
- Be there.
Thank you.
That' s so nice.
- See you tomorrow.
Bye.
See you.
- Halley, what is it?
What' s wrong?
- It' s you.
- What do you mean, it' s me?
What did I do?
- Nothing, exactly.
like you' ve been somewhere else for the past few days.
- That' s not true.
- Don' t lie to me, Jonathan.
I' ve imagined the dress and the flowers... and even the music the band was gonna play.
And everything is exactly the way I want it, except for my fiance, who' s just decided to float off to Never- Never Land.
Look, maybe I' ve been a little bit out of it the past week, but it' s just normal, you know, guy stuff.
Doesn' t mean I don' t love you.
- Well, call me crazy, but I' d like my fiance' s feet to be warm, especially when we' re hours from going down the aisle.
I' m sorry, Hal.
Really, I am.
Whatever it is that you' re holding on to, please just let it go.
Please.
I think it already let go of me, okay?
Wait.
- What' s this?
- What do you think?
It' s the traditional groom' s gift.
- I got yours, and I forgot to bring it.
It' s okay.
Open it.
It' s a first edition.
It' s just that every time we go into a bookstore, you' re always flipping through it.
You don' t even have a copy.
What' s wrong?
Don' t you like it?
It' s perfect.
It' s an excellent choice.
# When you know #
# That you know #
# Who you love #
# You can' t deny it #
What' s going on?
Are you all right?
Her name' s Sara Thomas.
What?
How did --
Halley gave it to me as a wedding gift.
# Never let him go #
# 'Cause you know #
# And you know that you know #
Sally?
It' s Dean from obits.
Hey.
I need an address for a Sara Thomas.
S- A- R- A T- H- O- M- A- S.
Uh, I got an old phone number.
Yeah, we' il hold.
Hang on.
Sir, can you pull this thing over?
I can' t hear a thing.
Honey, just one second.
Okay, go.
What?
What?
We have to cancel Dusseldorf.
We have to cancel Stockholm?
# You can feel love' s around you #
# Like the sky round the moon #
# This is how love has found you #
# Now you know what to do #
# When you know ##
Look at those stars.
They all have names, you know.
I don' t know what that is.
It' s Cassiopeia.
The... stars in the sky.
It' s Cassiopeia.
I miss my own wedding, okay?
- Does that bother you in the slightest?
- You are a jackass.
- Well, thank you.
- You are.
You --
Y- Y- You' re my hero, you know?
You' re like my oracle and shit, you know?
You' re out there, man, and you' re making it happen.
Courtney moved out.
- Yeah.
It' s -- Look, man.
We' d been fighting for a really long time.
Why didn' t you tell me?
We didn' t want to ruin your wedding, man.
- Didn' t want to rain on your parade, man.
- What the hell happened?
We just --
We let it slip away, you know?
That' s the point.
It -- You know, it died.
- We died.
- What was the cause of death?
Not enough of all of this, of this, of this.
And not enough, you know?
Do you --
Do you remember the philosopher Epictetus?
You remember what he said?
He said, "If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid."
That' s what you' ve done.
- I work hard at it.
- Now I want to be a jackass.
You know?
You' re the shit!
That would be me, the shit.
Yeah.
Okay.
You know what, old buddy?
On second thought, maybe you should call first.
- What are you talking about?
- Give her a ring.
It' s more polite that way.
Calling her gives her a chance to clean up.
I don' t care how clean her house is!
- She might.
- What are you talking about?
- You told me to go!
You said I was your hero!
- I forbid you to look.
- You can' t look!
- Why are you hanging on?
Don' t get hurt!
- You' re hurting me!
I think that went very well.
Didn' t -- Didn' t she say that everything happens for a reason?
- Yeah, she did.
- Well, maybe we' re laying here because --
Because why?
Because you don' t want to be standing somewhere else.
Yeah.
We' re crawling.
We' re crawling.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking.
I' m sorry to report that we' re gonna be on the ground a little longer... due to some bad weather heading this way.
The air traffic controller has put us on hold, so in the mean time, I' ve asked the cabin attendants to start the movie.
- Hey, you getting ready?
- Yeah.
You know me.
I love a good wedding.
- So have you talked to Lars?
- Yeah.
We spoke this morning before he left.
I think he' s gonna be okay.
At least I hope so.
Of course he' s gonna be okay, and you' re gonna be okay too.
Yeah?
Oh, you know what?
There' s a lady glaring at me.
I don' t think I' m supposed to be on the phone.
Can I call you when I get home?
Have a safe flight, okay?
- Lots of love.
- Headsets?
- Yes, I will. - $3. 00, please.
What the hell is this?
Something the matter?
Yes.
I think I' ve mixed up my wallet with my friend' s.
Yes, I have.
See?
Prado.
Well, is there any money in it?
I' il have a look.
Yes, there is.
Thank you.
Two ones... and a five.
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Thank you.
- Uh, sorry.
Excuse me.
- That' s this gentleman' s change.
- Jonathan.
Jonathan.
- Excuse me.
I just --
Sorry.
You know what?
I' m going to --
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Whoo!
I' m sorry!
Hi.
Yeah.
It' s in New York City.
I need the address of a Jonathan Trager.
Yeah.
T- R- A- G- E- R.
34 Charles Street?
Thank you.
34 Charles Street.
Hi.
I' m looking for a Jonathan Trager.
Is this his building?
- You must be late.
- Late for what?
The wedding.
Waldorf- Astoria.
- He' s getting married?
- Might be already.
- Wait!
Wait!
Excuse me!
- [Tires Screech]
Sorry.
Can you take me to the Waldorf- Astoria as fast as you can go, please?
Can you see what it is?
Sorry.
Sorry!
Oh.
Oh, please, God, no.
- Stop!
- Stop?
Is it over?
- The wedding?
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
It' s over, all right.
Butdon' t worry.
You' il get your present back.
- Excuse me?
- They always return thepresents.
You asked if it was over.
The truth is, it never even began.
- Yeah.
He called the whole thing off this morning.
He called it off?
That' s terrible.
Were you a friend of the bride?
Or the groom?
- What' s up with this weather?
- What happened to spring?
- So, what kind of pep talk do you want?
- What do you got?
Well, I' ve got the inspirational "You can achieve anything you dream about."
It' s very popular, but not appropriate for this.
Of course, there' s the "Don' t worry, there' s more fish in the sea" pap.
- No.
- Uh, we can always fall back on the classic...
"When God shuts a door, he opens a window."
How about telling me I did the right thing?
I don' t have to tell you.
I wrote it.
- What' s this?
- It' s your obituary.
- Nice.
- Turns out I had writer' s block... penning your best man speech, and that' s what ended up coming out.
Blame it on the day job.
- Twenty, right?
- Thanks.
- You going to see Courtney?
- Absolutely.
I needed this.
You know, the Greeks didn' t write obituaries.
They only asked one question after a man died:
"Did he have passion?"
How do I look?
Like a jackass.
- Good luck, man.
- Thank you.
Jonathan Trager, prominent televisionproducer for ESPN, died last night from complications of losing his soulmate and his fiance.
He was 35 years old and soft- spoken and obsessive.
Trager never looked the part of a hopeless romantic.
But in the final days of his life, he revealed an unknown side of his psyche.
This hidden quasi- Jungian persona... surfaced during the Agatha Christie- like pursuit for his long- reputed soulmate, a woman whom he only spent a few precious hours with.
Sadly, the protracted search ended late Saturday night... in complete and utter failure.
Yet even in certain defeat, the courageous Trager secretly clung to the belief... that life is not merely a series of meaningless accidents or coincidences.
Uh- uh.
But rather it' s a tapestry of events... that culminate in an exquisite, sublime plan.
Asked about the loss of his dear friend, Dean Kansky, the Pulitzer Prize- winning author and executive editor of the New York Times, described Jonathan as a changed man in the last days of his life.
"Things were clearer for him," Kansky noted.
Ultimately, Jonathan concluded that if weare to live life in harmony with the universe, we must all possess a powerful faith in what the ancients used to call "fatum,"
- what we currently refer to as destiny.
- Destiny.
- So what are you gonna do?
- I don' t know.
I guess I' m just gonna try and find him or something.
I don' t think you should do that.
I really don' t.
- Well, what do you think I should do?
- Just be here.
- I feel it.
I feel it in the air.
- Eve, what' s happened to you?
You' ve become your own worst nightmare right there.
Bye.
It' s freezing out here.

- Happy anniversary.
- When did you get to be so unabashedly romantic?
I think it' s good luck we return each year to the scene of the crime.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Oh, I don' t think so!
No beverages on the premises!
- I' m gonna have to ask you to leave.
- Hey, how you doing?
- Don' t you remember me?
- Yes, I do.

- Yes.

We want some gloves.
Black cashmere gloves.
Oh, I' m sorry.
That' il be the closing bell.
Perhaps tomorrow.

That concert rocked and rolled.
I know because I was there.
That' s me.
My water broke.
Eversince then, I' ve had this cosmic connection with Neil.
But this story isn' t about Neil.
It' s about me and my two pals, Darren and J. D.
Best friends since fifth grade.
That' s J. D. He' s lactose intolerant.
And he' s not very bright.
That' s Darren Silverman.
He' s a romantic.
But when it comes to women, he' s incredibly gullible.
That' s me, Wayne.
I' m loyal to my friends.
- I' d beat you up if you weren' t a girl.
- Me too.
We stayed best friends throughout high school.
I was the third- string quarterback.
J. D. became the school mascot.
Hey, what did you say I didn' t really motherfucking hear you.
And Darren joined the cheerleading squad.
Oh, that' s Sandy.
Yeah, Darren' s always had a thing for her.
When you' re up against a Warbird
You' re upside down!
Oh, that' s Coach Norton.
He was a big influence in our lives.
He taught us many things.
Two things you got to remember, boys.
Number one:
Stay away from women.
All they want from you is your man juice.
Now...... if you get any urges that you can' t suppress with hard liquor, use this.
- Oh, number two....
- Sportsmanship.
Sportsmanship.
Sportsmanship.
You fairy wimp fruit bag!
You suck!
Le Fessier!
Get out there!
I' m just gonna get my helmet.
Hey, guys!
Guys, I' m in!
- See, he' s going in!
- Oh, my God!
Go, Wayne!
Go, Wayne!
Blue 48!
Blue 48!
Go!
Set!
Hike!
But now we' re all grown- up.
J. D. is rapidly working his way up the ladder at Subway.
Recently he was promoted...... to temporary second assistant manager in charge of training.
Okay, McNugent, let' s see what you got.
I' ve been working on them for 8 weeks.
I present the future of Subway.
Bellston...... three sizes of bevy are small, medium and what?
- Big?
- Like we practiced.
You can do this.
L....
Long!
Okay, we' il come back to you.
This guy' s my stinkiest student by far.
Trimball, let' s see your sub.
No, no.
Meat on the inside, bread outside.
Okay, take it away.
Take it away!
Don' t judge me on those two guys.
This next guy' s my protégé.
He' s top of his class, and for his thesis he made a party sub.
Heston, where' s the party sub?
Darren is a social director at a retirement home.
B- 17.
Bingo.
Bingo.
Abe...... pull your pants up or no more Matlock.
I started my own business.
What are we dealing with here?
I don' t know, but it sounds big.
Stay back.
I' m going in.
Careful, sonny.
So you' re causing all this trouble, huh?
Come here.
Hey there.
Hello.
Here' s the ferocious beast, huh?
Hey, where' s your mommy?
Get off!
Get it off!
Is it dead?
No.
But she is in one deep coon coma.
Stop it!
Our love for Neil.
That' s ourband, Diamonds in the Rough.
Hey, I' m Darren.
Sophie.
Do you, maybe, want to grab a drink with me?
I' m sorry.
I' m involved.
With a real entertainer.
I can' t believe I got blown off again.
I' il never meet the right girl.
You don' t want a chick who' d fuck a mime.
Dude, what does a mime look like when it' s having sex anyway?
It' s probably like:
"I' m a mime.
I' m a mime. "
Hey, mimes don' t talk.
They do when they' re off duty.
It' s not her.
It' s all women.
I' m really afraid that there' s nobody out there for me.
The only girl I ever loved...... walked out of my life years ago.
Sandy Perkus.
- Rememberher?
- Smile.
Her family was with the circus.
Her dad was The Strong Man.
Hermom was The Bearded Lady.
Herbrother was The Dog- faced Boy.
You know, I truly believe...... that there is a one and only someone for everyone.
And Sandy...... Sandy Perkus...... was my one and only.
Man, that is so romantic.
Oh, my God!
Look at that juicy piece of ass.
What do you think of her?
- Who?
- Right there.
In the red?
- Yeah, she' s gorgeous.
- Go talk to her.
- No.
- Okay, I' il do it for you.
What?
Hey, wait.
I' m Wayne.
- No.
- No, you don' t understand.
I' m not hitting on you.
Back off.
I just want to tell you about my buddy, Darren.
He' s smart, he' s sensitive --
- I don' t care.
- He' d make a great husband.
- I don' t want to meet him.
- Great.
Dude, she wants you.
She thinks you' re really cute.
- Really?
- Yeah, she' s like:
"Oh, I' m so excited to meet him," and everything.
- Are you sure?
- Totally!
Get down there and make your move.
I don' t know.
Come on!
- Carpe poon!
- Really?
- Okay, I' il do it.
- All right!
I' m Darren.
Darren.
My friend said you wanted to meet me.
He lied.
That' s a good one.
No, seriously.
I don' t want to meet you.
My friend must have been mistaken.
I' m really sorry to bother you.
Let me guess.
That jerk tried to get into your pants with some tacky line.
I' m not like that.
I use magic.
Beat it, baldy.
Okay, good stuff.
I like that.
I have here two...... ordinary metal rings.
You and me.
I love you.
Sorry, I forgot my beer.
This is my boyfriend, Darren.
So hit the bricks, porky.
Okay.
Nice to meet you, Darren.
Satan.
I' m sorry about hitting on you before --
- You should be.
- I am.
I am.
I just, I wasn' t thinking in....
You' re so beautiful, and I....
I' m sorry.
So make up for it.
Buy me a drink.
- Yeah.
Okay.
- I' il have a Scotch.
Give the lady a Scotch, and I' il have another beer.
- He' il have a gin and tonic.
- Make that a gin and tonic.
Can you believe he hooked up with the queen of all hotties?
They' re just having a drink together.
It' s not like they' re going steady or anything.
It' s midnight.
You know what that means?
No.
What?
It' s our six- week anniversary.
- Did you get me anything?
- No.
That' s okay.
That' s okay.
No big deal.
But...... I...... got you a little something.
Thanks.
That' s really nice.
You know, I' ve been thinking.
We' ve been together for a while now...... and it seems like maybe it' s time...... we get a little more intimate.
Are you saying you want to have sex?
Yeah, I am.
I don' t believe in premarital sex.
I' d rather not cheapen what we have.
Of course.
Of course not.
Me neither.
- So it' s best to wait.
- You' re right.
I think -- I mean, you' re -- It' s best.
But...... that doesn' t mean that we can' t...... pleasure each other in other ways.
I got you.
Oh, I got you.
That was really great.
Thanks.
That got me pretty excited.
That' s nice.
I mean, I wouldn' t mind if someone did that to me.
Oh, I get it.
You want me to go down on you.
I would love to, but I can' t.
I have very, very sensitive gums.
You have gums -- It' s a medical condition.
I wouldn' t want to cause you any pain, baby.
No.
You' re so sweet.
You know, there are other ways to give me pleasure without using your mouth.
Oh, God, I am so inconsiderate.
I' m sorry.
No, that' s fine.
That' s fine.
Have fun.
- Watch your head.
- This place is a dump.
I really don' t want to do this.
It' s our Sunday ritual and I want you to be part of it.
I want you to get to know these guys.
You' il love them, honey.
- Yeah, buddy.
What' s up, dude?
- What' s up, J. D.?
Judy, awesome to meet you.
Judith.
Judith.
And a beer bong for the lady?
- No.
- Totally cool.
No peer pressure.
Judith rules.
Sorry.
Come on in.
Check it out.
Chewie.
You want a drink?
- Scotch on the rocks.
- You want ice?
I' il help you with that.
Hey, Judith.
Can I give you the grand tour?
Let' s start right here in the "Hall o 'Neil."
This is Neil, '74.
Check this out.
This is a set list from the Millennium Concert.
Look:
Signed by Neil.
Got that on eBay.
Looks like a Xerox.
No.
This cost a lot of money.
Check this out.
- I think you got taken.
- Ready?
This shirt...... was worn by Neil...... in concert.
Check it out.
We snuck backstage...... and totally stole it from him while he was taking a whiz.
In my profession, we call your obsession with Neil...... a delusional projection fantasy.
Yeah, sure.
But he' s America' s greatest songwriter and he' s our hero.
And he' s playing the Forum in two weeks.
Of course, we can' t go because of the whole restraining order thing.
Neil, I love you!
You again!
Neil!
Where are you going?
I want to party with you.
I want to party with you!
Game' s on.
Game' s on.
- Give me the remote.
- I want to go.
- Give me a beer.
- We just got here.
These guys are pigs.
Come on.
No, they' re not that --
Hey!
What are you doing?
Dude, if you get the nachos stuck together, that' s one nacho.
Okay, look.
Why don' t we just stay for a little bit, okay?
Oh, take mine.
Take mine.
Give her the old sweep- a- roo.
Old Ethel.
We' ve been through a lot of games together.
Enjoy.
I' il help you.
She has multiple reclining positions.
- I can sit forward.
- It' s stuck.
- It' s fine.
- Takes a little muscle.
Come on, you fucking piece of shit.
- I don' t need -- - It' s no trouble.
Are you okay?
I' m sorry.
That hardly ever happens.
You know what?
I think I -- Yep.
It' s the lug nut.
Fixed it.
Please have a seat.
I' il stand.
I' m a --
- Sorry.
- Get me something.
So Darren tells me you' re a psychologist.
- That' s right.
- Interesting.
I' m in a related field.
Really?
What' s that?
Pest and rodent removal.
How is that related?
We both help people.
While you deal with their emotional and intellectual needs...... I protect them from gophers, coons, roaches, silverfish....
He launched it.
Touchdown!
I don' t want you to see Wayne or J. D. ever again, Darren!
But they' re my best friends.
You' re getting new friends, and you' re quitting that bullshit band.
I know you' re upset.
I do.
But I am not dropping Wayne and J. D...... and I' m not quitting the band.
Okay, fine.
No more sex.
What?
You' re not allowed to go down on me for one month.
No, Judith, please --
Don' t make me take away your masturbation privileges.
You go, boys.
You sing this song.
You know it.
Come on, boys.
Sing it!
- Sing it!
- This blows, man.
Judith' s out of control.
We gotta do something.
Besides ruining the band, what else has she done?
Ever since she moved in with him, she' s controlled his life.
She didn' t like his ass.
Made him get butt- cheek implants.
I thought his ass looked tighter.
Check this out.
Last night...... torched his Neil Diamond albums.
She torched Neil?
You' re right.
She' s a monster.
Two, three, four.
- Hey!
- Yes!
- Hey, guys, sorry I' m late.
- It' s all right.
I only have a minute.
I have to wax Judith' s legs.
- We miss you.
- We never see you anymore.
I know, I' m sorry...... but I' ve just been so happy spending time with Judith.
Plus, my relationship counseling sessions --
Counseling?
Yeah.
I go two hours, three times a week.
Oh.
Who' s your counselor?
Judith.
We don' t think she' s right for you.
Break up with her.
She' s ruining our lives and yours.
This graph should illustrate our point.
93.
It is now an eight.
Band numbers have plunged dramatically.
Girls, never very high, at nine.
But look now.
Two!
This has led to increased wanking off.
I' m chafing.
Shit, I gotta go home and heat the wax.
Guys, listen.
Thanks for your concern, really.
I miss you too.
But it was great seeing you, all right?
That guy' s in serious trouble.
We need to save him.
Sorry to bother you.
What are you doing here?
And the salsa bath.
That was bad.
- Get the hell out of here.
- Just give us a minute, okay?
My rate is $200 an hour.
Do you have any money?
I got some of that.
Just give me the big bills.
Six.
Is that all you have?
Thirty. $7. 38.
Two and a half minutes.
We don' t want you seeing Darren.
We don' t think you' re right for him.
The band needs him.
- But we' re prepared to buy you off.
- With what?
My house.
Okay?
Look.
My grandma here?
She was born in this house, is buried in the back yard.
There' s my mom...... there' s my dad and there' s me.
My dad was dropping me on my head.
But...... we' re willing to sign this over to you...... if you just agree not to see Darren.
I don' t want your shitty house or your dead grandma.
I' il throw J. D. in.
He doesn' t look like much...... but he' s hung like a horse.
It' s true.
Look, Darren' s mine.
There' s nothing you can do about it.
I own him.
He does whatever I say.
I' m in complete control of him.
He' s my puppet and I' m his puppet master.
You' re not taking Darren away!
Just try to stop me.
One round, winner takes Darren.
- You' re on.
- Kick her ass.
Go.
You' ve got quite a grip.
You must be a heavy masturbator.
My guess is three times a day?
I bet you' re a premature ejaculator.
You start off with a big bang.
Before you know it, you' re limp.
- I win, you lose.
Now get out.
- God!
Hey, check it out.
Hey, baby.
Hello, ladies.
So how much?
Fifty bucks for you, and 200 for your friend.
- Okay.
- All right.
I want you to laugh like he just said something.
Perfect!
Get this one.
Be like this.
Like this.
Douche, douche.
Yeah, you.
Slap his ass.
That' s not sexy.
Watch it.
You' re moving my guy!
Lookit.
Lookit.
Good.
- Check this out.
- He' s cheating on you.
Nice try, idiots.
Oh, man.
We' re engaged.
Sandy?
Yeah, it has.
Hey, it' s Wayne.
Right!
Man.
Great.
Oh, wow, that' s great.
Me too.
- See you.
- Take care.
- Okay, bye.
- Awesome.
Bye.
- This is it!
- What?
Isn' t "one and only" like, one...... and only?
- Where' s the lemon wedge?
I want you to meet two exciting people.
Brett is a tax attorney, and Clayton' s a CPA.
This is my fiancé, Darren.
- Same.
- Thank you.
Excuse me, I' il get it.
What' s going on?
No.
I think it' s very possible she didn' t even send us invitations.
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Who' s Darren talking to?
- I' il have a merlot.
- We don' t work here.
- This is Darren.
- Darren' s our friend, Brett.
But we are taking this into overtime!
Okay, strategy session.
- Dude, she' s Freddy Krueger.
- No, Damien.
Okay, now, Sandy?
And Darren loves Sandy no matter what he says.
Definitely.
Roger that.
-- sound.
Copy that.
- Yes, after the kidnapping.
What?
God!
Keep checking.
Get the door.
Get the door.
Door.
Darren, I' m leaving you.
Done.
Why me?
I' m dealing with Darren and Sandy.
No.
Who the hell are you?
Thanks for meeting me.
- Are you single?
- Yes.
Great.
You know what?
He works with the elderly.
Really?
- That is so sweet.
- He still talks about you.
Wayne, I' m gonna become a nun.
In a week, I take my final vows.
But after I graduated, I joined my parents in the circus.
I fell in love with mypartner, Luigi Panini.
Luigi wanted to impress them.
- Wow.
After Luigi died, I knew I would never love again.
- Right.
- So technically, you' re not a nun yet.
Well, no.
I mean, not yet.
- I don' t think so.
- No.
- What?
- A hermaphrodite.
Sandy Perkus, and she wants to see you.
Crowbar me.
Damn!
In unrelated news, the body of deceased local Joan Snerd...... was dug up in a grave robbing last night.
Police arrested three Cubans.
- So you can eat and have clothes.
I' m not supposed to tell you.
- I suppose.
- More or less.
Oh, Stanford University?
Subway University.
Did you know J. D. McNugent?
No.
Never heard of such a person, ever.
- There was nothing I could do.
- Great.
- Coach!
- He' s out- of- bounds.
Well, boys, I don' t think so.
So when will they let you out?
The victim' s whiny family' s protesting.
What' s their damn problem?
Well, coach, we need your advice.
Darren fell in love with this girl, Judith.
- Kill her.
So we screwed up because now she knows who we are.
So we can' t let her go, or she' il turn us in.
Kill her.
Exactly.
You have the dream.
- Okay.
Now, go on home and snuff her.
- Come on, move.
Where' s your bird suit?
- Yeah.
You didn' t kill Kevin Beckley.
He died in a car wreck.
- She doesn' t know that.
It doesn' t matter if we' ve killed or not!
We' re gonna do it right now!
- Ready?!
- I can' t!
Goddamn it!
Okay, I gave her your word.
When you go out with Sandy.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Come on!
Come on!
Hey!
Wow, you' re wearing the --
A nun.
Well, that explains it.
- I hope it doesn' t freak you out.
- No, it doesn' t.
Actually, I' m relieved.
I think Wayne was trying to set us up on a date.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Please.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
So how are your parents?
Oh, great.
They' re making a fortune on the lnternet.
They started their own Web site, circusfreak. com.
Wow, good for them.
He got rabies.
- God, that' s too bad.
- Yeah.
So how are you?
Oh, me?
- I am so sorry.
- Oh, don' t be.
It' s nothing.
Oh, gosh.
Just cry.
I' m here for you, okay?
Wait a minute.
Wait.
I know.
Thanks.
Wayne' s not --
You have a self- defeating personality disorder.
Right.
And I remember you were a really good dancer.
And strong too.
Ready?
- I can' t -- - Just hang on.
Let it out now.
Come on.
- Have you ever had a girlfriend?
No.
Have you ever fantasized about having sex with a man?
- Any man.
How short?
Sometimes people can be too short.
That' s weird, like midgets.
Definitely.
- Not that it matters now, you know.
- Right.
- Perfect.
- Thanks.
Yeah, certainly.
Thanks.
Me too.
I understand.
I' il get out of it.
I' m gay.
It' s all gonna be okay.
Judith escaped.
Go.
Go.
Where?
I missed her.
Oh, thank God.
Hurry up.
Oh, scrotum!
- Now!
I got her.
Okay, Judith, it' s over.
Oh, thank God.
Hi, officers.
I' m Cowboy Wayne.
- Yeah.
Okay, then, I' il see you later.
There.
Wait.
No, you' re not.
You' re just unsuccessful with women.
No, I' m gay.
She listened.
- Like what?
- Like my obsession with Bette Midler.
My preference for track lighting.
And the fact that I like sucking dick.
What?!
I don' t want to hear anymore.
Okay!
- You want to be gay with me?
Come on, go, come on.
Okay.
Come on.
This is a terrific convent.
What kind of feelings?
Yeah, but it' s so much more than that.
Now, let' s go bust out some power squats.
There.
This....
- How am I gonna eat?
- I thought of that.
- It' s breakfast.
It' s pancakes, sausage, hash brown, Pop Tart, puréed.
To save our friendship.
Friendship?
None of your business.
So it' s been years?
- I' m waiting for the right woman.
- There is no right woman.
- Skank!
Judith' s dead.
Yeah, but...... I could' ve sworn it was her.
God, I' m fine.
Okay?
There' s the duck.
- I should leave.
I will never mention Judith' s name again, really.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Okay?
- What do you want?!
I have a problem.
I' m with Sandy, but I can' t stop talking about Judith.
I' il be right there.
What is this?
Perfect.
I am back.
- Excuse me.
- Hey.
And if I do that...... I need to know that you want marriage and a family.
I never thought I' d say this to anyone after Luigi died, but...... I love you, Darren.
- Judith?!
- I mean Sandy.
Oh, my God!
Oh, jeez.
It was a little weird.
- What' s going on?
It' s aversion therapy.
Oh, my God.
It' s so much worse than I thought.
Oh, my God!
Darren.
- I ran here from the club.
- Really?
- Yes.
Forgiveness is just sort of my thing.
I love you.
- Really?
- I love you.
- I love you.
Love.
- Happy?
- You didn' t have to do that.
Either way, that' s nice of you.
- Why Darren?
- What do you mean?
Yeah.
- There' s different types of love.
Yeah, whatever.
Big balls.
It did?
Oh, my God.
Little key, little key.
What am I doing?
Okay.
- So?
- Since when?
- Since always.
- I never knew that.
- You didn' t know a lot, like I' m gay.
- Anything else you want to tell me?
Shut up!
Hi, coach.
What are you doing here?
- Congrats.
Great!
I gotta take a dump.
Coach can' t stay here!
- Oh, yeah!
Play it cool.
He can' t be here because we' re getting laid.
We' il tell him we got ghosts.
- Listen, coach -- - We have ghosts.
It' il give us a chance to get to know one another again.
Good.
- Yeah.
My hat goes off to you.
That' s the kidnap victim, ain' t it?
I am really disappointed in you boys.
We can' t, coach.
You been pussified.
Don' t worry about a thing, boys.
Of course not.
I love a good challenge.
- I' m so happy.
- Oh, me too.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Judith?
We gotta find her.
- Okay, where to?
And they fed me, like, crushed potato chips under the door.
Please.
Please, don' t.
Don' t leave.
You' re right.
You' re right.
Why, Darren?
Okay.
Bye.
Sandy, hi.
Darren, look.
I deserved that.
Stop!
- Freeze!
- Get your hands up!
Don' t think my presence here means I forgive you.
You don' t want to marry Judith.
- Of course I do.
Then look into my eyes and say it.
Dude, how?
Coach.
- No way!
- Really?
Bye, everybody!
Lost another one.
I can' t believe I' m doing this.
Oh, here.
Where did you get these?
J. D. 's sister.
Go!
Neil Diamond!
Neil, let me explain.
Naked pictures.
What?
- Sorry.
Judith brainwashed him.
- Hold on.
- And did I mention I was gay?
- Right.
Yeah!
- Where we going?
One little prison break, and they' re all over you.
No matter what happens, don' t look back.
Hey, we' re coming to America.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join Darren Silverman...... and Judith Fessbeggler in holy matrimony.
- Neil.
- No.
Because I...
... I love Neil...... and I love Sandy.
Sandy is my one and only someone.
What about me?
You' re right.
I have a weakness for incompetent morons.
Admit it!
I' m the strong- willed, assertive man that you need...... and you' re the hard- core bitch that I' ve always dreamed of.
- When are you gonna get hitched?
Really?
Hot August night, 1972.
That' s me.
My water broke.
Best friends since fifth grade.
- Me too.
You' re upside down!
Number one:
- Oh, number two....
Sportsmanship.
I' m just gonna get my helmet.
Go, Wayne!
I present the future of Subway.
- Big?
Long!
Heston, where' s the party sub?
B- 17.
Bingo.
Stay back.
Careful, sonny.
So you' re causing all this trouble, huh?
Hello.
Is it dead?
Ourlove forNeil.
I can' t believe I got blown off again.
I' il never meet the right girl.
Hey, mimes don' t talk.
It' s not her.
- Rememberher?
Herbrother was The Dog- faced Boy.
And Sandy...... Sandy Perkus...... was my one and only.
Man, that is so romantic.
Look at that juicy piece of ass.
- Who?
- Right there.
- Yeah, she' s gorgeous.
- Go talk to her.
- No.
- Okay, I' il do it for you.
Hey, wait.
- No.
- No, you don' t understand.
I' m not hitting on you.
Back off.
I just want to tell you about my buddy, Darren.
He' s smart, he' s sensitive --
- He' d make a great husband.
- Great.
Dude, she wants you.
"Oh, I' m so excited to meet him," and everything.
- Totally!
Come on!
- Carpe poon!
- All right!
No, seriously.
My friend must have been mistaken.
I use magic.
Okay, good stuff.
I am.
- Yeah.
Give the lady a Scotch, and I' il have another beer.
- Make that a gin and tonic.
What?
It' s our six- week anniversary.
- No.
Thanks.
You know, I' ve been thinking.
Yeah, I am.
Of course.
Me neither.
- So it' s best to wait.
- You' re right.
Oh, I got you.
Oh, I get it.
You have gums -- It' s a medical condition.
I' m sorry.
No, that' s fine.
- What' s up, J. D.?
Judy, awesome to meet you.
Judith.
- No.
Judith rules.
Sorry.
Chewie.
You want a drink?
Hey, Judith.
Signed by Neil.
Looks like a Xerox.
No.
Check this out.
- Ready?
Yeah, sure.
- Give me the remote.
- I want to go.
- We just got here.
These guys are pigs.
Why don' t we just stay for a little bit, okay?
Oh, take mine.
- Takes a little muscle.
I' m sorry.
That hardly ever happens.
You know what?
I think I -- Yep.
It' s the lug nut.
Please have a seat.
- Sorry.
How is that related?
Sing it!
She didn' t like his ass.
- Yes!
I know, I' m sorry...... but I' ve just been so happy spending time with Judith.
Yeah.
Oh.
She' s ruining our lives and yours.
93.
Band numbers have plunged dramatically.
Girls, never very high, at nine.
Guys, listen.
Thanks for your concern, really.
I miss you too.
We need to save him.
Sorry to bother you.
And the salsa bath.
That was bad.
I got some of that.
Just give me the big bills.
Six.
- But we' re prepared to buy you off.
- With what?
You must be a heavy masturbator.
My guess is three times a day?
You start off with a big bang.
Hello, ladies.
- Okay.
Douche, douche.
Lookit.
- Check this out.
Come on.
Hi, Judith.
How' s it going?
He' s sick.
- Oh, totally.
- Right?
You broke up?
- Dude, congratulations.
Anyway, it' s too late to change it.
Darren.
Sandy?
Sandy Perkus.
It' s been so long.
Yeah, it has.
Hey, it' s Wayne.
That was me.
Yep.
Sandy, remember me?
I went to the prom...... with a tuxedo painted on my naked body.
I spilled a drink and the paint ran and everyone could see my dong.
It doesn' t ring a bell.
Man.
Yeah, same here.
- Take care.
- Awesome.
Bye.
- This is it!
It' s your big chance.
- Here' s your drink.
- Where' s the lemon wedge?
Wow, that is exciting.
- Congratulations.
Is Darren here?
What' s going on?
We' re having our engagement party.
Oh, then I guess our invitations must' ve been lost in the mail.
I think it' s very possible she didn' t even send us invitations.
- Who' s Darren talking to?
- My name' s Brett, this is Clayton.
- Darren' s our friend, Brett.
- We knew him first.
Get out of here!
She thinks this gig is over.
Okay, strategy session.
- Okay, our enemy is wicked.
- No, Damien.
- Dude, she' s Vader.
Okay, now, Sandy?
That girl, she' s a nice girl.
- She' s a sweetheart.
- A goddess.
Definitely.
- All right!
- I' m scared.
- Not gonna happen.
I' m hungry.
- Can we go to Happy Burger?
- Yes, after the kidnapping.
- Me neither.
Wait a second.
What is it?
I' m hit.
Dead leg.
Door.
Done.
Get downstairs!
That' s okay.
I love catching up with old high school friends.
Great.
He' s a really good guy.
He works with the elderly.
- That is so sweet.
There' s something --
I wasn' t in high school.
Luigi!
- So technically, you' re not a nun yet.
Well, no.
I mean, not yet.
- I don' t think so.
Definitely not.
Come on.
- Who?
- She dumped you, dude.
Judith' s coming back.
I got it.
Oh, my God.
Go.
- Jacket' s caught.
Take it off!
I love this jacket!
Lose it!
That was my favorite jacket.
The other guy' s the boss.
Clever.
Thanks.
- You must be very well- educated.
- S. U.
Oh, Stanford University?
Never heard of such a person, ever.
Goddamn it!
- She knows who we are?!
- Coach.
- Coach!
Touchdown!
No touchdown.
Well, boys, I don' t think so.
Well, I' ve got an appeal pending, but it doesn' t look good.
The victim' s whiny family' s protesting.
So, what brings you boys here?
Well, coach, we need your advice.
Okay, shoot.
Darren fell in love with this girl, Judith.
- And we kidnapped her.
- Kill her.
So we can' t let her go, or she' il turn us in.
Kill her.
We can' t kill her.
You can!
But, coach, I mean, come on, actually kill a person?
If you can dream it, you can do it.
Exactly.
You have the dream.
- Okay.
Now, go on home and snuff her.
- Come on, move.
- Thanks, coach.
Because we' re gonna kill you.
You aren' t going to shoot me.
What makes you say that?
Sure we are.
I killed a man once.
- Yeah.
You didn' t kill Kevin Beckley.
He died in a car wreck.
- You see?
- Ready?!
Goddamn it!
For God' s sakes, when will you give up this idea that I' il go out with Sandy?
Come on.
Come on!
All right!
Hey!
I' m training to become a nun.
A nun.
- I hope it doesn' t freak you out.
- No, it doesn' t.
Actually, I' m relieved.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Friends.
Please.
- Thank you.
Oh, great.
They' re making a fortune on the lnternet.
Oh, good.
Good.
So how are you?
Yeah, everything' s been really good, you know?
So how do you feel about....
Just cry.
Wait a minute.
Wayne' s not --
Yeah.
I think that you seem depressed and confused.
You think?
You have a self- defeating personality disorder.
Have you considered therapy?
I remember in high school, you were really into helping people.
Right.
And I remember you were a really good dancer.
And strong too.
You used to be able to lift me up over your head.
Still can.
And....
Yeah, well, the convent' s got a great gym.
- Have you ever had a girlfriend?
No.
- Which man?
- Sure.
I mean, not that it matters now...... but if I had asked you out back in high school, would you have gone?
Definitely.
- Thanks.
Yeah, certainly.
I have these.
Thanks.
- Can you zip me up?
I had a really good time.
What about tomorrow?
Everything will be all right.
Der!
Go.
Now.
Open up!
Tonight Mr. Chang gets lucky.
I got her.
Okay, Judith, it' s over.
Oh, thank God.
You' re safe.
- Yeah.
No, you' re not.
- Like what?
No problem!
Okay!
- No!
All you, all you!
What' s the matter, dear?
Oh, don' t get me wrong.
This is a terrific convent.
Well...... I' m having these feelings.
You mean sexual feelings.
Yeah, but it' s so much more than that.
Now, let' s go bust out some power squats.
There.
- It' s breakfast.
It' s pancakes, sausage, hash brown, Pop Tart, puréed.
To save our friendship.
Friendship?
- Eunuch!
- I was on -- - You poor thing.
No.
There' s the duck.
- I' m sorry.
- I should leave.
No, you shouldn' t.
I' m so sorry.
I will never mention Judith' s name again, really.
I swear.
I swear.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Please.
I' il be right back.
Okay?
In a -- In a moment.
Damn it!
- What do you want?!
- Wayne, it' s me, Darren.
I' m with Sandy, but I can' t stop talking about Judith.
Okay.
I' il be right there.
Okay, open up your shirt.
- Why?
- Just do it.
What is this?
Now...... here' s what' s gonna happen.
I' m going to listen to your conversation.
Now...... if you say anything about Judith...... or so much as mention her name...... then I' il give you a little shock.
Perfect.
I don' t think I' m comfortable having these things on my nipples.
I could put them on your balls.
The nipples are fine.
Nipples work.
Hi.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I' m back.
I am back.
There was a talkative men' s room attendant.
That' s okay.
- Excuse me.
- Hey.
- This table' s reserved.
- You know what?
I come here all the time, and spend a lot of money...... so why not leave me the hell alone?
I don' t mean to be pushy...... but if this relationship is gonna get serious...... I have to give up becoming a nun...... and I' d have to decide soon...... because my final vows are on Sunday.
Yeah, that thought had occurred to me.
And if I do that...... I need to know that you want marriage and a family.
Absolutely.
I never thought I' d say this to anyone after Luigi died, but...... I love you, Darren.
I love you too, Judith.
- Judith?!
- I mean Sandy.
Okay?
You' re out of here.
Put me down!
I haven' t ordered yet!
Time for an attitude adjustment, mister.
Hey, nice move.
Damn, he' s good.
Darren!
Oh, my God!
Oh, jeez.
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?
It was a little weird.
- What' s going on?
- I can explain.
It' s aversion therapy.
Wayne was trying to help me get over Judith...... so I had these things -- Nipples --
Oh, my God.
It' s so much worse than I thought.
No, you' re obviously not ready for this relationship.
No, I am!
Sandy, wait!
Okay.
Damn it!
Wait, wait.
Wait, Sandy!
Oh, my God!
Darren.
What happened to you?
- I ran here from the club.
- That' s 30 miles!
Yeah, I know.
I wanted to say...... I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
Can you ever forgive me?
Because the whole Judith thing and the nipple clamps...
-... it' s crazy, and -- - Yes!
- Really?
- Yes.
Just like that?
Well, I am training to become a nun, you know.
Forgiveness is just sort of my thing.
I love you.
- Really?
- I love you.
- I love you.
- Oh, love.
Love.
- Happy?
- You didn' t have to do that.
I just happened to be by Arby' s.
They were throwing out old food...... so, you know, I thought, "Why not?"
Either way, that' s nice of you.
I was wondering:
- Why Darren?
- What do you mean?
You don' t seem the type to go for a sensitive guy like Darren.
You seem more the kind of woman that needs an assertive type of guy.
Before I met Darren, I was --
I was engaged to a guy like that.
His idea of fun was to fly to Thailand to fight in a kickboxing tournament.
U. S. A.!
Go, Josh!
After that, I decided no more tough guys.
Yeah, and then you found Darren.
Yeah.
- So do you even love him?
- There' s different types of love.
I knew it!
Sometimes you make rational decisions.
You can' t always follow your heart.
Yeah, whatever.
I will admit there' s something sexy about a man who takes charge.
Like you kidnapping me.
That took balls.
Big balls.
I gotta say it turned me on.
It did?
Oh, my God.
Goddamn these chains!
Little key, little key.
What am I doing?
I can' t let you go!
Just give me one free hand.
It' il be worth it.
Okay.
Give me the fries.
- Hi.
- Wow.
Hey.
Shit.
Just wait one minute, okay?
- Dude -- - Dude, you got a boner?
No.
- Why didn' t you answer the door?
- I' m eating.
- So?
- I don' t answer when I' m eating.
- Since when?
- Since always.
- I never knew that.
- You didn' t know a lot, like I' m gay.
- Anything else you want to tell me?
- I got three balls.
Shut up!
God!
Dude.
Hi, coach.
What are you doing here?
Retrial.
Got a judge that' s a sports fan.
- Congrats.
- What will you do now?
That' s why I' m here.
Need a place to crash, figure out my next move.
I knew I could count on you.
- Well, we gotta talk about -- - You stay as long as you like.
Great!
Where' s the bathroom?
I gotta take a dump.
We don' t use the toilet anymore since we' re cutting down on the water bill.
What do you do?
Well, we just use the lawn now.
Smart thinking.
Oh, God!
You pinch loaves on the lawn?
I play croquet out there.
Are you crazy?
Coach can' t stay here!
- We got a woman locked in the garage!
- Oh, yeah!
You boys got any T. P.?
No!
That' s all right.
I' il find something.
Play it cool.
We' il find some way to get rid of him.
We tell him we got dates.
He can' t be here because we' re getting laid.
No, he' il never believe that.
We' il tell him we got ghosts.
So, boys, what' s for supper?
- Listen, coach -- - We have ghosts.
We were thinking that maybe you staying here' s not such a great idea.
Nonsense.
It' il give us a chance to get to know one another again.
So you boys take care of that bitch that was gonna marry Silverman?
Yeah, we snuffed that bitch just like you said.
Good.
How' d you do it?
- We -- - Ate her.
You ate her?
- Yeah.
We ate her.
- Alive.
My hat goes off to you.
You boys are smart.
That' s the perfect crime.
Wonder what' s on the tube.
- No!
Coach!
- No!
What the hell we got here?
Some kind of public access show?
That' s the kidnap victim, ain' t it?
You didn' t kill her!
No.
Coach, listen....
I am really disappointed in you boys.
I want you to go out there and off that cooze.
We can' t, coach.
Oh, for Pete' s sakes!
Look!
She' s getting out!
Go chop her head off or something.
There' s no fight left in you boys.
You' re nutless.
You been pussified.
Don' t worry about a thing, boys.
I' il take care of that broad.
- Don' t worry!
- Who are you?
Let' s say I' m a friend of the boys, and I' m here to kill you.
You don' t mind if I try to defend myself, do you?
Of course not.
I love a good challenge.
Are you okay?
Dude --
Got it?
- I' m so happy.
- Oh, me too.
Does this couch fold out?
What the hell is going on here?
- Judith!
- Yes.
- You' re alive.
- Yes.
- Judith?
- Who is this tramp?
I' m not a tramp.
Actually, until yesterday, I was training to become a nun.
I' m gone for a week, and you' re screwing a nun?
No, no.
We' re in love.
I thought you were dead.
Oh, really?
Well, I' m not dead.
I was kidnapped, okay?
It was hell!
I was beaten, tortured...... and treated like a frigging farm animal!
And the entire time...... the only thing that kept me alive was the thought...... that somewhere out there, my sweet Darren still loved me...... and that one day we' d be together again.
It was so horrible.
- Where are we going?
- I don' t know.
We gotta find her.
- Okay, where to?
- Go left!
I' m going right!
They kept me in a dark closet for days.
And they fed me, like, crushed potato chips under the door.
Maybe I should go.
Oh, no.
Please.
Please, don' t.
Don' t leave.
Well, but, I mean...... Judith' s alive, and she is your fiancée.
I know.
You' re right.
You' re right.
But....
But you can' t go because I....
- Because what?
Why, Darren?
- Because I --
- See, you -- - Yeah?
- Well, we -- And -- - Yeah?
Sweetheart, we pledged our love to one another.
Spare her the pain of seeing us together.
You...... run along back to the nunnery.
She' s right.
I mean...... I did pledge.
Okay.
Bye.
She' s here!
Hey, Darren.
Sandy, hi.
Look, I can -- Darren.
Sorry.
Darren, look.
I understand that you' re really upset.
I probably look like a really big asshole --
Dude!
Okay.
I deserved that.
But now let me explain --
Okay, I guess I deserved that one too, but now we' re even, okay?
Stop!
We only did it because we love you.
Oh, right, because you love me.
Yeah, man.
Come on.
Give me a hug.
It' s --
- Freeze!
- Get your hands up!
Don' t think my presence here means I forgive you.
I just wanted to tell you guys in person.
Judith and I are getting married tomorrow.
You don' t want to marry Judith.
Admit it.
- Of course I do.
- Okay.
Then look into my eyes and say it.
I want to marry Judith.
Look into both our eyes at the same time and say it.
I' m out of here.
Come on.
We' re sorry, okay?
What we did was wrong.
We gotta stop that wedding.
Dude, how?
Let' s go, you maggots!
Kill!
Kill!
Kill!
Coach.
Yeah, it' s Wayne and J. D. Look, we need your help.
I' d do anything for you boys.
Name it, you got it.
Well, we need you to post bail for us.
It' s $10, 000 apiece.
- No way!
- Come on, coach.
We need your help.
Jail life is real tough.
They' re --
They' re sodomizing us in here.
What?!
They' re corn- holing you?
Oh, my God.
That' s horrible.
Don' t worry.
I' il get you out.
You got sodomized?
Who?
I want to meet him.
What is that?
Sounds kind of like my truck.
Come on, boys.
Let' s go.
Get the lead out, boys!
Hut, hut!
Come on, move it!
You' re free.
Now, where to, boys?
Go left.
Charge!
Sandy Perkus...... do you vow to lead a life of poverty...... chastity, obedience...... and silence?
Wait!
Sorry.
Look, you can' t do this.
- You love Darren, right?
- Well, yeah.
- Well, Darren loves you.
- Really?
Darren' s her boyfriend, but he has this other girlfriend...
-... and he' s getting -- - So, what are you gonna do?
Go, my child.
- Okay.
- Come on.
We' ve got a wedding to crash!
Go.
Go.
Go.
Bye, everybody!
Damn.
Lost another one.
Son of a bitch.
I can' t believe I' m doing this.
Oh, here.
We got you some clothes.
Where did you get these?
J. D. 's sister.
- She' s a stripper.
- And a hooker.
Go!
Gotta go!
Oh, my gosh!
Neil Diamond!
What the hell is going on?
Neil, let me explain.
You' re the guys who send me all those letters and tapes.
Naked pictures.
What?
We never sent you any naked pictures.
- Dude.
- Sorry.
Mr. Diamond, you gotta help us save our buddy.
He' s marrying the wrong woman.
Sandy and Darren, they broke up.
Love on the rocks.
Ain' t no big surprise.
- Help us get them back together.
- I don' t know.
Turn on your heart light.
Judith brainwashed him.
For years, Darren loved me, but I never knew it.
Hold it.
Hold it!
- Hold on.
- And did I mention I was gay?
I' ve spent my life writing songs about the power of love...... but up until right now, they' ve only been words.
This may be my chance to prove that those words really mean something.
- You say that if Darren marries...
- Judith. -... Judith, he' il be miserable.
- Right.
I believe in happy endings.
If Neil Diamond has anything to do with it...... this love story will have one.
Come on!
Yeah!
We got Neil Diamond onboard!
All right!
- Where we going?
- The park on America Avenue.
- 5- 0!
- What?
Cops.
Caprice.
Five cars back.
Goddamn heat.
One little prison break, and they' re all over you.
Whoa, coach.
No matter what happens, don' t look back.
Just get this sweet gal to the man who loves her.
I' d rather be cut down in a hail of gunfire than to go back to jail.
Nice meeting you, Mr. Diamond.
Coach, look out!
They' re not cops!
Hey, we' re coming to America.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join Darren Silverman...... and Judith Fessbeggler in holy matrimony.
If anyone has any objections, speak now.
I do.
- What?
- Neil?
- Neil!
- Neil.
Get to the part where we say, "I do."
Oh, my!
- Say, "I do."
- No.
Say, "I do."
I can' t.
Because I...
... I love Neil...... and I love Sandy.
You' re in love with this slut?
I am not a slut.
Sandy is my one and only someone.
What about me?
Who' s my someone?
You ruined my life!
But I saved Darren' s!
Just because I lost Darren doesn' t mean I' m crazy enough...... to hook up with you!
Why can' t you just admit that when you kissed me, you liked it?
You' re right.
I have a weakness for incompetent morons.
Admit it!
I' m the strong- willed, assertive man that you need...... and you' re the hard- core bitch that I' ve always dreamed of.
What about you?
- When are you gonna get hitched?
- Actually, I' m not.
I' m gay.
Me too.
Really?
By the power vested in me by the state of Washington...... I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
I now pronounce you man and man.
You may kiss the man.
Come on, we need you for this one.
If someone had asked me not long ago...... why I thought men left women and never came back...... I would have said this:
New cow.
The new cow theory was born of a broken heart.
It came to me while reading about male behavior in The New York Times...... which chronicled a fascinating study...... on the mating preferences of the male cow.
First, a bull was presented with...... a cow.
They mated.
The next day, the bull was presented with the same cow.
The bull wasn' t interested.
He wanted new cow.
And this was old cow.
To see if they could trick the bull, scientists used an ingenious ploy.
The old cow was smeared with new cow scent.
But he was no fool.
This wasn' t new cow.
This was just old cow incognito.
Old cow in sheep' s clothing.
Mutton dressed as lamb.
I' m getting ahead of myself.
To understand the theory and how it took over my life...... you need to hear the whole story.
When I met Ray, I was booking talent for The Diane Roberts Show...... a New York talk show that had just been syndicated.
We' d been given a small window of opportunity to prove ourselves.
We' re back with Mary Lou Corkle, conservative activist...... who' s here to talk about her new book, The Nest Crisis.
One of your central arguments...... is to blame society' s problems on working mothers.
Diane wanted to reach her audience...... by appealing to both their understimulated brains...... and their overstimulated appetite for tabloids.
Ambition' s blinded these women to familial duties.
So, doing what I do makes me unfit for motherhood.
We make our own beds, don' t we?
That is true.
Who makes your kids' beds...... while you' ve been out selling your book these past three months?
My job was to supply a steady diet of raw meat...... to sate Diane' s Emmy- clad ambitions.
Hi, Donald, we' ve gone national.
We' ve started a new format.
Major exposure.
It' s perfect for Hillary.
Trust me, everyone wants on.
My only colleague was writer, producer and womanizer, Eddie Alden.
- How we doing?
- Publisher' s having a coronary.
- You book them, I cook them.
Yeah.
Thank you, we' re talking to Mary Lou Corkle....
Any progress with Cuba?
Well, just keep trying.
This Castro thing' s gonna kill me.
She won' t let it go.
- Forget Castro.
Get a creative angle.
- Such as?
- Elena de la Goya.
- Who?
One of the women the ClA hired to kill him in the '60s.
- This is a smoke- free building.
- Blow me.
The ClA created a "scent of death" oil that smelled like perfume.
She' d wear it, he' d kiss and lick --
- Sorry.
He was supposed to croak....
Eddie could find the sex factor in almost any subject.
He considered this a gift.
- You forgot these earrings.
- You don' t waste any time.
- Cynic.
- Slut.
If Eddie was enough to make me lose hope in men...
- Got a minute? -... it only took one to bring it back.
- Hey, Ray.
- We haven' t met yet.
I' m Ray Brown.
- Our new executive producer.
- From Washington.
I saw your piece for Newsline.
That was brilliant.
Thank you.
We just did a follow- up.
That' s why I' m late.
I' d better scoot.
Jane, want me to turn up the AC?
You look a little flushed.
Okay.
- I know.
Interesting.
People must confuse you with the scientist.
- Are you?
- Maybe Curious George when I was 5.
- He was a monkey, not a chimp.
- I do.
See you around.
I heard Lynne Cheney' s people are difficult.
They fear it' il turn into an abortion debate.
- Which is right.
- Of course.
Say Diane won' t bring it up, and plant someone to initiate it during Q and A.
You came to the right show, Ray Brown.
- So he' s cute?
- Very.
Care to elaborate?
Pale blue eyes, athletic, sort of J. Crew, but not as preppy.
- That guy again.
- You gonna buy anything or not?
- Shush, I' m concentrating.
- Okay.
- Marital status?
- Why are we having this talk?
- Right.
It' s too much work.
Even if I were up for it, he' d probably end up marrying her.
There' s the cynical bitch I know and love.
Case closed.
I' m leaving this one alone.
- Feeling carnivorous?
- Absolutely.
What else should I know about you?
Apart from your addiction to processed foods...... much to the chagrin of your girlfriend...?
Dee.
Whom you' ve been dating now for...?
- Three years.
- Three --
Excuse me.
Three years.
Wow.
That' s more serious than I would have guessed, you know, off the cuff.
Think you' il ever get to the moment where you just know it' s right?
That' s it?
That' s the person you' re meant to be with forever?
Probably.
God, he was cute.
- It' s me!
- We' re in here.
- Just jab it in!
- Don' t rush me!
- What' s going on?
- Your sister started on injections.
- Of orange juice?
- Fertility drugs, Jane.
The orange is for practice.
If you can' t stick it into a Valencia, what about my ass?
If it' s not done right, we' il lose another month.
- That' s supposed to be my job.
This is an emotional time and you' re sucking the romance out of it.
We kissed romance goodbye when you started jacking off into a cup weekly.
Leave my sperm count out of it!
Chubby Hubby?
I' il look at the dirty magazines with you.
That' s great, just great.
Very grown up.
At least one of us is.
Morning.
Don' t bother.
I already know you' re an asshole.
You always complain about your small place.
Move in with me.
- You can' t be serious.
- Why not?
I only meet hip successful types.
I want someone like you.
- Gee, thanks.
- This would be strictly financial.
- I' ve no interest in you that way.
- What a relief.
- Is that a no?
- Actually, it' s a:
"Thanks, but not if my life depended on it."
- Hello.
- You up for a walk?
- What?
- What?
I was just gonna --
I can' t speak.
You say something.
No, no, don' t.
Do you think I' m insane?
Not at all.
I was thinking how good my place looks with you in it.
- M Magazine.
- Let' s start again.
You ate Cocoa Puffs, then a couple cartoons....
- A Tweety and a Road Runner.
- Then more kissing.
- Right.
- Okay, go on.
We got ready for work.
I walked him to the door and --
- Big finale- type kiss before leaving?
- Exactly.
- That' s good.
Very good, considering.
- Considering what?
Considering he' s picked out his wife!
I told you, they' re having problems.
They' re not engaged.
Yet.
He sounds like a prospect, so here' s what you do.
Never mention her name.
Change the subject.
If you bring her up, he' il feel pushed.
This way it' s like, "No pressure."
- It' il drive him nuts.
- Where do you get this?
Snag- men- dot- com.
It' s very informative.
- Read the papers.
Twenty- three- year- old women are lying about their age.
Miss "I have a crush so I' m in denial," get on your game!
What do I do now when I see him in my staff meeting in five minutes?
Pretend he doesn' t exist.
Good morning, Eddie.
- What is on your neck?
- I bit myself shaving.
- Isn' t that why God made turtlenecks?
- It' s why God made Darlene.
You are so gross.
Hi, Jane.
- Hey, Ray.
Hey, Ray, good morning.
You okay?
You look a little tired.
Evelyn.
Straw.
Okay.
I' m late.
I know.
I locked myself out of the apartment.
Nightmare.
Nicest cabdriver in this city.
- Who saw ABC' s 4 a. m. newscast?
- I think a lot of us missed that.
It told how single media outlets aren' t working.
Where are we on interactive?
- The web site should be up Monday.
- Not should be, will be!
We cannot sell this show on the budget they gave.
We need streaming 24/ 7.
And we need to make every show count.
Remember...
-... it is all about the get.
- The get.
We cannot make a splash if we get the gets everybody' s already gotten.
- I need the ungettable get.
- Got it.
Good.
Okay, where are we on Fidel?
I spoke with Juanita, his foreign press secretary...... who assured me that the moment...... el presidente was back from his fantasy baseball camp...
- Did she imply interest?
Did she discuss availability?
Do we have a shot?
- Jane!
- Sorry.
What do you think your chances are of getting him?
I think they' re good, Diane.
I think they' re very good.
Just a minute.
Sorry.
I thought I' d just do a few sit- ups.
Joy: the emotion evoked by the prospect of possessing one' s desires.
Rapture: the experience of being carried away by emotion or passion.
Ecstasy: a state of being beyond reason and self- control.
I cannot feel my legs.
Tell me what we' re doing.
We' re coming up for air.
- Hey, that' s a good idea.
- Yeah.
This one' s pretty.
With your eyes.
Could be risky, given your impatience with buttons.
- I love it.
- My treat.
- Shut up.
Let me buy you a shirt.
- Thank you.
- Hey, guys.
- Eddie!
Hey.
- What are you doing?
- I just....
She' s helping me pick a shirt.
- Well, I didn' t mean to intrude.
- Not at all, please.
I gotta go to a thing.
Great running into you.
My God.
- See you.
- All right.
What a coincidence.
First I run into Ray, and then you.
I didn' t even know he lived around here and there he is!
Okay, so I am sleeping with him.
If you tell anyone at the office, so help me God....
What are you thinking?
I' m thinking the same thing you are.
Happily ever after with your matching Volvos and chocolate Labs.
- See you Monday.
- Did you have friends growing up?
I think he' s waiting down the street.
I love you, Jane.
I love you too.
He just said it after only six weeks?
Oh, my God.
It takes most guys a year to use the "L" word.
When they do, they' re usually on top of you, so it doesn' t count.
- What about Dee?
- He' s telling her tomorrow.
- Why didn' t he already?
- It' s complicated.
If he had second thoughts, I don' t think he' d ask me to live with him.
He asked you to live with him?
My God.
What did you say?
He started calling realtors, and I gave my landlord notice.
Wow!
Mazel tov.
I can' t believe this!
You' re getting asked to play house, and I' m on hell' s blind- date circuit.
- I take it last night didn' t go well.
When Julian offers one of his straight friends, shoot me before I say yes.
I' m in a sad state.
And I' m telling you, it' s just screaming "potential." Hello?
- I didn' t mean to intrude.
- We' re fine.
Didn' t you want to see the patio?
Isn' t it just wonderful?
Wait till you see the view, it' s spectacular.
Right down to the World Trade Center.
It' s such a jewel box.
I guess I' il leave you two alone to talk things over.
- Oh, my God.
It' s unbelievable.
- I love it!
The light is so good.
I love you.
I don' t know.
I gotta go.
He looks like he' s been hit by a bus.
I' il call you back.
- I feel like I' ve been hit by a bus.
- You told her?
- Was it bad?
- Not like I thought.
I mean, she didn' t go hysterical or anything like that.
She was just, you know, eerily calm about the whole thing.
- Well, that' s good, right?
I just meant --
- It wasn' t what I expected, is all.
- What did she say about us?
I didn' t tell her.
I just didn' t think it was necessary.
To hit her over the head with this after three years, it just seemed...... so awful.
I just told her that it was over.
And I think that' s all she needs to know.
Sure.
And she was okay with that?
I don' t know.
It was weird.
She just kind of....
You know, she just kind of went cold on me.
I mean, she' s upset.
She' s upset, the poor thing.
She' s gotta be upset.
She didn' t seem terribly upset so....
Well, you' re okay with it, right?
- I mean, you' re happy?
- Happy.
I am so happy.
I mean, this is what I wanted.
I mean, there' s nothing between us anymore.
That' s what I was looking for, so I' m happy.
How exactly did Ray disappear?
Slowly and kind of subtly.
- Single pane, double pane?
- Single pane, I believe.
Singles, wow.
A lot more sun than I had recalled.
This doesn' t open?
Oh, well, gotta force it.
Well, maybe it wasn' t so subtle.
It' s me again.
The realtor said we have to sign the lease by Monday.
I know you wanted your lawyer to look at the contract...... but my apartment' s been rented.
I have to be out --
He' s not sleeping with somebody else.
Ray isn' t like that.
The poor guy wouldn' t have time.
He' s been working until 3 a. m. every night.
All guys have time to mess around.
Right?
You gotta talk to him.
It' s better than not knowing.
- Oh, come on.
- Sorry, this patch is worth shit.
Prey species have developed a wide variety of escape behaviors.
Freezing is a common response to predator alarm.
Sensing danger, many animals will assume a rigid, statue- like position.
Fleeing is another popular method.
Some species will try to outrun their captors...... while others take an erratic zigzag course...... in the hopes that direction shifts will tire the predator...... causing her to give up the chase.
Smell the bacon, Jane?
What' s happening here?
We haven' t been alone in a week.
We lost that apartment because your lawyer supposedly messed up...... which is okay, but as of Saturday I don' t have a home.
Ray, what the hell' s going on?
I don' t think I can do this.
- Do what?
- This.
- Us.
- What?
Why?
- I don' t know?
- What do you mean, you don' t know?
- There has to be a reason.
- Jane, I' m sorry.
You deserve an answer, and I don' t think I can explain.
I thought we felt the same way:
Incredibly lucky to have found the thing.
I did.
- And here you go.
I just think that we both need to take a step back.
I mean we' re talking about a very serious move here.
I just wanted -- I still....
- I don' t know what I' m trying to say.
- I feel like such a jerk.
- Believing that this was -- - Listen to me, I love you.
I want us to be important to each other.
Please don' t do that.
Please go.
There are few things sadder in this life...... than watching someone walk away after they' ve left you.
Watching the distance between your bodies expand until there' s nothing...... but empty space and silence.
Remember, time wounds all heels.
- Are you all right?
- Why, don' t I look all right?
- You look like you hate my guts.
That' s nice.
I don' t blame you.
This hasn' t been easy for me either.
Yeah, you look really destroyed.
Eddie, did you by any chance ever find a roommate?
Well, no, actually.
The place I was supposed to move into suddenly fell apart.
My apartment' s been re- rented.
Is the offer still good?
- You' re moving in with Eddie?
- What' s the apartment like?
Lots of windows.
Living room.
That sounds amazing.
When can I see it?
- How about tonight?
Perfect.
Everything is just perfect.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- Here it is.
- It' s huge.
Yep.
Here' s the kitchen, living room, whatever.
My bedroom, bathroom, this' d be your room.
What happened here?
I got the urge to renovate.
I' d have it fixed before you moved in.
- You want a drink?
- Sure, some water.
- We don' t share a bathroom, do we?
- I never use the bathroom.
So how' d you find this place?
My ex- girlfriend worked in an emergency room.
When someone died she' d check their address, see if it was rent control.
- You lived with somebody?
- Yeah.
For how long?
For a while.
So what do you think?
I think I must be out of my mind.
Morphine for the pain.
It was right after she moved out.
I just took an ax and started hacking away at it.
As if I thought opening up that wall might make it easier to breathe.
I don' t smoke.
Whoa, girl.
You okay?
Oh, yeah.
What was her name?
Rebecca.
Put your shoes on, we' re going downstairs.
- What' s downstairs?
- You' il see.
There are two realities:
First, we' re in love and it' s incredible, it' s perfect.
Then poof!
"Sorry, Jane, doesn' t work for me anymore."
- How' s that possible?
- You were living a fantasy.
Romance, true love, soul mates.
It' s all bullshit.
None of it exists.
Trust me, I speak from experience.
Man, she really did a number on you, didn' t she?
Don' t shit on my broken heart...... because you' ve converted to a warped brand of romantic atheism.
Oh, man, whoo.
It' s called self- preservation.
In other words, you narcotize yourself with casual sex.
That implies I avoid reality when, in fact, I embrace it.
- Casual sex is very liberating.
- I' il bet.
- I almost feel sorry for her.
- What for?
I make no pretenses.
If she puts me up on a white horse, it' s her choice.
We' re all grownups here, Jane.
I lay awake that night wondering which was worse:
Or the Eddies who went right for your pants.
Oh, excuse me.
In the end, it didn' t matter.
The truth was...... they were all cast from the same mold.
But the question remained.
Why?
One day by the river, I found my answer.
Holy shit.
I told them dumbasses it' d never work.
You can' t fool a bull.
He knows where he' s been.
He won' t go back.
Hell, I got 93 cows.
Only one of them got 'nads.
Why?
Because that son of a bitch can knock up the whole herd.
But once he' s done, the party' s over.
I gotta go to Ed Hickey' s place and trade him for a new one.
There ain' t a chance he' il touch any of them cows again.
- I figured it out.
I' m the Old Cow.
- I don' t get it.
Remember laughing at the graffiti on the subway?
- "I love the toilet you sit on?"
- "I hate banging the same woman."
- It was true, a window into their -- - Schizophrenic behavior.
The New Cow Theory and "I hate banging the same woman." Same thing.
Men can' t commit because, eventually, we all become Old Cows.
We' re identified as already serviced, so they seek less familiar females.
- The whole novelty thing?
- Neophilia, to be precise.
- What do you think?
- I think it' s always about you.
You fall for a guy, men are worthy of heroic worship.
You' re dumped, they' re commitment- phobic asses.
The entire universe doesn' t revolve around your romantic status.
You' re in love.
- I' m almost in love.
Almost.
- Oh, honey, why didn' t you tell me?
You' re in a spectacular mope.
I didn' t want to ruin it.
We met at a work party a couple of weeks ago.
It' s just incredible.
And he' s so and -- And I' m so and --
I appreciated Liz' s intoxication over her seeming good fortune...... but I refused to be derailed.
Now armed with my New Cow Theory, I became voracious for information.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- What' s this?
- Give it back!
"An organ in the nasal cavity connecting smells to memories.
Banana slugs, actually hermaphrodites...... while mating, the males chew each other' s penises off. "
I worry about you, I really do.
Despite my conviction, there was the occasional setback.
- I want my erotic nose- brain removed.
- Pardon?
My amygdala, the organ in the nasal cavity that processes scent...... which connects to memory.
I' d like it extracted.
Why voluntarily make yourself anosmatic?
Let me see if I can explain this.
I had this boyfriend.
And he smelled really, really good.
Like soap...... fresh laundry and vanilla.
Every time I smell those smells, I' m reminded of how happy we were...... before he dumped me for no reason.
Then I get angry, and before I know it...... I' m in the throes of an emotional breakdown!
So I was thinking, Doctor Kline, if I could short- circuit my nose...... I' d have a chance to live a seminormal life someday.
Hey, wait!
- Couldn' t sleep?
Me neither.
- This happen to you a lot?
- Yeah.
Me too.
- Yeah.
Talent.
These are good.
Here.
Head back.
- Good.
- Good.
Cold dumplings, my favorite.
- Way to go, Tomcat.
Two points.
- Tomcat?
- Cheerleader.
- I was a cheerleader.
- You were?
Paul G. Blazer High.
Pride and joy of Cincinnati.
- State champs, 1989.
Go, Cats.
- Go, Cats.
Go on.
- No.
- Why not?
- I haven' t done it in 10 years.
- Show me.
- Do something that merits a cheer.
Like... three dumplings.
Left- handed, in a row.
- You can' t do that.
- Deal?
Deal.
One.
Two.
Three.
Like that?
Come on.
Go on.
- Do you promise not to laugh?
- No.
Come on.
- What are those?
- Pom- poms.
- I hate you.
- It' s okay.
Okay.
The Tomcats are here to show --
Okay.
The Tomcats are here to show who' s top!
You think you can beat us, but we can' t be stopped!
Go, Tomcats!
- First and ten -- - Eddie?
I' m Jane.
Roommate.
- Isabel.
- Nice to meet you.
- You can clean up, it' s your turn.
- Okay.
Good night.
We' re a little noisy.
Hi, George, it' s Jane --
I sensed things were off when he got back from L. A...... but I thought he was tired.
Then he says France isn' t a good idea.
He' il have to work the whole time.
Still, no big deal.
Right?
Wrong.
An hour ago, I call to say good night.
Guess who answered, 1: 00 a. m., Paris time?
- Penelope Pope.
- Who' s Penelope Pope?
"Who the fuck is this?!"
- Oh, God, Liz, I' m sorry.
- I don' t get it!
Why feed me all that romantic crap if he' s just gonna cheat?
- Two words: copulatory imperative.
- What?
The biological urge to spread seed.
Less than 5% of male animals are monogamous.
- The other 95% are....
- Plugging Penelope Pope.
I stopped by H and H and picked up...... a sesame seed bagel, lightly toasted, just like you liked.
I hope Ray' s cold turns into pneumonia and bed rest causes abs to atrophy.
Ben wants a women' s column.
It hit him, 20% of our readers are female.
The idea is for it to be about men.
How they' re paranoid about going bald and what not.
- Forget baldness.
The real issue is their behavior, their copulatory impulse.
- Imperative.
More hot water, please.
- I think you should write it.
- Are you crazy?
- Well, why not?
- So?
We need someone with experience.
Liz, I don' t know what I' m talking about.
I just have notebooks filled with ridiculous facts.
This is not a full- time job.
It' s a sick, twisted, pathetic hobby.
So get paid to write about your obsession.
If you want, we' il give you a pen name.
It' d be cathartic for you.
Do your dear, sweet friend a huge favor.
Pen name, huh?
One time.
- Fine.
It' il be fun.
I' m concocting the background of a nonexistent scientist...... about to publish her delusional theories in a men' s magazine.
You' re right.
This is fun.
Born in Sussex, 1937.
Cofounder of the Institute of Pathological Narcissism in Vienna.
Who is she?
The recently deceased Harriet Gould.
No surviving relatives.
- She' s perfect.
She even has a bun.
- That' s her.
Dr. Marie Charles.
Oh, my God.
Every bull begins a relationship with aces up his sleeve.
Tools of seduction by which he lures a New Cow.
One of the most notorious examples is the Current Cow Sob Story.
Allow me to deconstruct the essential elements:
You' re so easy to talk to.
Not like my Current Cow.
The Myth of Male Shyness:
You think he' s flattering you?
He' s flattering himself.
Showing how sensitive and honest he is.
I just try so hard.
I' m sure she doesn' t mean to be a Cold Cow.
In case you think he' s a cold- hearted womanizer...... he' il say this to show he' s leaving his Cow for a reason...... and he' s tormented by the thought of leaving her.
What do they say about the love of a good woman?
That, once offered, it' il come back and bite her in the ass.
Enter: case in point.
- You' re not with what' s- her- name?
- Didn' t work out.
Get a little saddle sore on your white horse?
So, what happened?
- Lost interest.
- What do you mean?
How exactly?
Do we really have to have another postmortem?
I' m just curious is all.
So you went to a movie?
Then back to her place?
Then what?
We' re in the kitchen, and she' s looking for food.
We' d had dinner after the movie, but she' s still hungry.
- She' s always hungry, it seems.
- And that' s bad?
Women who eat?
You' re in the kitchen, she' s hungry again, inexplicably.
Then what?
So she takes out a pint of Häagen- Dazs...... then starts eating it, standing there, out of the container.
- Something about it turned me off.
- Was the refrigerator door open?
- Why?
- Answer the question.
- It was open, I think.
- Would it matter if it were shut?
Would that have made a nonfat woman eating ice cream less revolting?
What if she were hungry before shoving her face into a trough of Häagen- Dazs?
Is using a dish less repulsive?
- Good night, you psycho!
- Good night, you neophiliac!
You sitting down?
Oprah read the article on her show.
The audience loved it.
She' s begging for Dr. Charles to be a guest!
Everyone in PR has a different story.
She' s in Hong Kong, she' s in Tangiers....
- This is bad.
- No, this is all good.
Trust me.
I' ve got it under control.
This won' t come anywhere near you.
"While the male may seem shy...... with his Uriah Heep hand- wringing and 'Aw, shucks' toe- kicking...... he is actually a narcissist because this apparent shyness...... belies the more deeply rooted feelings...... of unworthiness and fear of rejection.
And this is what compels him to constantly seek attention...... from New Cow after New Cow, ad nauseam, ad infinitum. "
This is such great stuff.
It destroys any sentimentality we have about what noble creatures men are.
Here' s what we' re looking for.
It' s provocative, it' s clever.
It' s got mass appeal.
But nobody can find this woman.
The Today Show' s tried, Oprah' s tried.
- And have you tried?
- Eddie?
- Well, no.
- Do you know what we' re talking about?
- Yes!
I don' t care what it takes.
You find that Dr. Marie Charles and bring her to my studio.
Your friend works at M, and she has no idea where the doctor is?
- That' s what she said.
- I don' t buy that.
- Why are you holding out on me?
- I' m not.
- Give me her number.
- No.
Besides, you' d never reach her.
She' s at Jivamukti.
- Yoga.
- Yoga what?
Jivamukti.
- Manhattan.
Jivamukti.
- Eddie!
- It' s a yoga place.
- Eddie, don' t be a jerk.
Eddie, come on, this is so ridiculous.
You have to leave your shoes in here.
Liz?
Excuse me, is --?
Jerk, she' s my best friend.
I' d know if there' s anything going --
Stay!
Bring your leg up.
Sir, you have to leave.
Sorry.
I' m just looking for a friend.
Oh, God!
- You okay?
- Eddie.
How you doing, Becca?
I' m good.
What are you doing here?
I don' t know.
Forget about this disturbance.
It' s okay.
Get back to your spaces and prepare for lion pose.
Inhale, exhale, open your mouths, stick out your tongue.
That was Rebecca?
Eddie, talk to me.
There' s nothing to talk about.
You cannot believe.
- Janie!
- Hi, guys.
Eddie, this is Alice and Stephen.
- You' re Eddie?
- Yeah.
- Are you taking yoga together?
- We were -- It' s stupid.
- We don' t think it' s stupid.
- We started a pregnancy class.
- Congratulations.
- She' s a great breather.
- Listen, I gotta go.
- It was really nice to meet you.
Eddie preferred to leave things unsaid...... and went back to grazing in greener pastures.
Merry Christmas.
- Okay.
- Two champagnes, please.
- Yes, sir.
Shouldn' t that be a champagne and a Shirley Temple?
Sorry.
- No, you' re not.
- So where' d you meet her?
- She' s Emily' s roommate.
- I made coffee for Emily last Sunday.
- Isn' t that complicated?
- It' s never complicated, Jane.
- Blintzes, not Blitzen.
- Good evening.
What can I get you?
- Scotch, please.
Hear Diane' s joke about the reindeer?
Funny!
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
I miss you, Jane.
Am I supposed to walk away now?
Can we get away from this?
Can we do something?
Get together for lunch, dinner.
Friday night?
- Oh.
That' s right.
- Don' t you?
Yeah.
Yes, I do.
I --
I have none.
Could I call you?
Would that be okay?
Merry Christmas, Jane.
You can' t stop now.
You' re syndicated in over 300 newspapers.
Talk radio' s having a field day.
- The world' s one giant Used Cow lot.
- I want to think about it.
You don' t want to be a post feminist icon?
Let' s get something great to wear for Julian' s party.
I meant to tell you that I kind of made other plans.
- It' s nothing major -- - What are you talking about?
- Ray?
As in Ray Brown?
As in devil incarnate?
No, I forbid it!
I thought you were over this.
I' m having second thoughts.
Oh, so now Dr. Charles is having them too.
- Done yet?
- You got a hot date?
- No, I just have to pee.
- Be my guest.
- What' s this?
Party Viagra?
- No.
It' s nicotine gum.
- When did you quit?
- Daphne wants to marry a smoker.
Here.
Thank you.
- Come out with me tonight.
- To trail after your harem?
I' m flying solo to keep my options open.
Although that may be for me.
- Hello.
- Have you come to your senses?
No.
Quit worrying about me.
Have a good time.
I' il wear the lipstick you gave me.
- Bye.
Why are you doing this?
Doing what?
- What are you talking about?
If you change your mind, I' il be here.
Thanks.
I think I' il just jump into my P. J. s...... probably watch a little TV, go to bed early.
- Happy New Year.
- Same to you.
Back to our special New Year' s Eve coverage with Hugh Downs.
It was less than 48 hours ago that Ray Brown called...... to confirm plans with Jane Goodale tonight...... a clear indication he regretted terminating their involvement.
So the question remains:
Why hasn' t he shown up yet?
It appears that Mr. Brown is sticking firmly to his September sanctions.
Ten, nine, eight, seven...... six, five, four, three, two, one!
Happy New Year!
Jane!
- Jane?
- Don' t even bother.
I need to talk to you.
- Why didn' t you return my calls?
- After the one you didn' t make?
- It' s not true.
- It' s so true.
Stop for a moment.
- Good morning.
- There' s a reason I didn' t go.
- I' m sure.
- I don' t care, so forget about it.
- Will you hear me out?
The truth is -- Hi.
You did me a favor.
Any delusions I had are gone now.
You released me.
For the first time in months, I feel great.
- Staff meeting in two minutes.
- Be right there.
What' s wrong?
Diane' s wearing your shirt.
The one I bought you on the sidewalk.
- So, are the two of you...?
- We' re seeing each other again, yes.
- Wait.
Stop.
Did you say "again"?
I should' ve told you, but Diane insisted on keeping it quiet.
We got back together and went away for a while.
It' s terrible that I didn' t call --
Ray, I got Tony Robbins on line three.
- Go on.
- I' m really sorry, Jane.
Hey, what is it?
- She' s Dee.
- I' m not following.
- Diane is Dee.
- Yes, "D" is for Diane, "E" for Eddie.
She' s the one.
I mean, she was the one, she is....
Just breathe.
Breathe, Jane.
- Back together, again.
I get it.
Let it go.
Ray and Diane?
- Yeah!
- Okay, it doesn' t matter.
That chapter' s over.
We gotta go, so pull it together.
Do you hear me?
Don' t cry.
- Okay.
- Okay.
You all right?
Jane, where are we for next week?
We' re set with Gérard Depardieu.
Right, Jane?
Oh, good.
New movie?
I actually....
I saw it.
It' s about a man whose marriage falls apart.
It' s brutal.
You see the love story first.
This woman means everything to him.
In fact, there' s this scene where he actually sits in just a dark --
It' s very touching.
He sits in a dark room and just --
You just start to see the tears and stuff.
The man is completely...... broken and you really feel it.
It' s devastating.
Is this a joke?
No, what do you mean?
I mean, is this a joke?
No, I saw it two nights ago.
- What' s so funny, Jane?
- Can you believe this guy?
So sensitive...... so devastated over some chubby French guy.
But stomp on somebody' s real heart...... and where' s his pity then?
Why?
He doesn' t get it!
He never gets it!
Someone explain it to me.
Because I don' t know what you are talking about!
Evelyn, is she free?
- Yeah, she is.
- Thanks.
I' m sorry, Diane.
I don' t know where that came from.
I know exactly where it came from.
- You do?
- Some guy crushed you...... and you lashed out at poor Ray as being representative of him.
- I' m right, aren' t I?
- More or less.
- Despite the hurt, you can' t do it.
- I know.
No, you don' t know.
Sit and listen to me.
I' m gonna let you in on a secret.
About six months ago, my boyfriend tried to leave me.
Well, he did, he left.
I was devastated.
I was destroyed.
Did you see it?
- Right.
Know why?
Because if I fall apart, everything around me falls apart.
Everything that I have worked my entire life for.
- Who?
Him.
The guy.
- I don' t know.
- Yes, you do.
Have you talked to him?
Well, no, not exactly talked.
Do it.
Talk to him.
I used to feel that if I kept my heart to myself...... if I never expressed how much I needed him...... he would never leave me.
Well, guess what?
He did.
And I lived in a private, pathetic puddle.
Until I couldn' t stand it.
I went to him with two corned beef sandwiches on rye, lightly toasted.
And I told him that I was lost without him.
You said that?
Pretty progressive, huh?
And I' m happy.
Never thought I' d be happy.
And you believe her?
This is love?
What we should all be looking for?
That is so tragic.
She has to believe that crap.
She' s an Old Cow.
All we need to do is adjust our radar a bit.
Learn to be attracted to men who don' t attract us.
Hang on.
What are you talking about?
Well, for example, normally...... I' d be attracted to you.
But thanks to Dr. Charles...... I' ve learned to control my passion for testosterone.
And now I' m proud to say I don' t find you attractive at all.
Well, gee, that' s swell.
I need a drink.
- Does she know she' s insane?
- No, she' s right.
- Ray cannot go back to an Old Cow.
- Okay, that' s it.
Jane, these are people, not cows.
Hello?
- I knew you' d take his side.
- This isn' t about sides.
It' s about reality.
You need to get a grip.
- Great.
So I' m a moron for sleeping around.
You, you get dumped and become the disciple of some crone scientist...... who can' t distinguish humans from animals.
- She is not a crone!
- Who gives a shit?!
While you were buying these theories about why guys don' t come back...... you were hoping Ray would.
Men are scum, but please, Ray, make a liar out of me.
Well, you got what you asked for.
He went back, but with the wrong girl.
It' s over.
Over.
- Because.
- Because why?
- Because I can' t.
- Why?
- Because I was happy!
Because if the theory is wrong, men don' t leave all women, Eddie...... they leave me.
I know what it does to you.
I know.
Maybe that' s why we hold on so hard.
We can' t believe that such a miracle can happen twice.
But it can.
Someday you' il find it again.
I promise you.
- I' m looking at you.
And you' re beautiful.
You are beautiful.
You' re intelligent...... and real.
And Ray' s not the last man you' il ever love.
I promise you he' s not.
Listen....
No, no, no.
- You' re not gonna analyze this one.
- I' m not?
No, no.
You want things to fit so much that you miss the fun.
You' re rationalizing last night.
Worried about what might' ve happened.
I get a kick out of spending an entire night with you in my arms...... without copping a feel.
Well... maybe one.
- What?
- Well, I' m relieved.
I mean, for a second l --
I thought maybe you thought last night was....
Or that you would...... think....
That would' ve blown Dr. Charles out of the water, huh?
Temporarily, maybe.
But you' d show your spots eventually.
My spots?
Men never fail to do what' s in their nature to do.
And what is that, Jane?
Disappoint you?
Abandon you?
What' s really behind these theories?
What are you hiding?
Nothing.
What you see is what you get.
Is it?
This is not about my nature.
This is about yours.
- Hello.
- Janie?
- Stephen, can I call you back?
- Your sister' s in the hospital.
We lost the baby, kiddo.
Hey, Janie.
Did you see Stephen?
- I saw him in the hallway -- - Getting ice.
God love him.
They break so easily, don' t they?
Last weekend, he woke up in a panic.
He said he had to shop for the baby.
You know how anal he is, I thought he' d come back with...... thermometers and baby blankets and safety gates.
But when he walked in the door, all he had was a little tiny bag.
Inside was this...... this perfect little baseball mitt.
He got it in his head that it was gonna be a boy.
Jane.
Okay, I' ve got ice.
I' ve got blankets.
I' ve got magazines.
Look at my wife.
Have you ever seen anyone more beautiful?
You' re nuts.
Diane, it' s Jane.
I' ve found Dr. Charles.
Everybody ready to have a good time?
You' il have to do better than that.
Let me explain how this show' s gonna work, okay?
Ray, do we have her on the line?
Two minutes.
Magazine' s putting her through.
Two minutes.
Diane, two minutes.
So Diane' s gonna come out for about a 15- minute segment.
The first interview' s by telephone.
Dr. Marie Charles.
Again, are you absolutely, 100% sure you want to do this?
I' m sure.
I' m sorry.
- I want to be sure you' re not insane.
- Maybe I am.
- Here she is, Ray.
- Dr. Charles.
I rarely have the honor to host such a distinguished...... and extraordinary guest.
Today, Doctor Marie Charles speaks out for the first time...
-... since the publication -- - Already 20, 000 hits on the web site.
- Holy cow.
- The reclusive doctor has agreed...... to an exclusive phone interview.
And I consider it a rare gift from someone whose work...... has meant a tremendous amount in my life, as I' m sure yours.
Dr. Marie Charles.
Hello, Dr. Charles.
Are you there?
Hello, Dr. Charles, can you hear me?
I' m not getting anything.
- Where the hell is she?
- We have a technical difficulty.
We' il get it worked out.
- Patch it through on another line.
- We only have one dedicated line.
- Take us to commercial.
- She' s here.
She wants to go on.
She' s here.
It seems the reason we' ve been unable to get through telephonically...... is because she' s here, having decided to do the interview in person.
- Holy shit.
- Let' s not waste any more time.
Welcome Dr. Marie Charles!
Just a little.
Stop!
Show yourself, Dr. Charles.
Wake up!
What?
Where' s Dr. Charles?
There' s no Dr. Charles.
There never was.
I invented her, Diane.
I invented her because I had something to say.
And somehow I thought...... if it were coming from a 65- year - old Ph. D., you' d see it the way I had.
As a truth, as a legitimate, scientific truth.
But it isn' t.
It' s completely ridiculous.
I lied to you all, and I lied to myself because...... the real truth is...
... that I was heartbroken and lost.
And I just wanted to understand it somehow.
I wanted it to be about them.
So everything I thought I had figured out was completely upside- down.
I thought that this bull had gone to a New Cow, but she was an Old Cow.
What was I talking about?
I was comparing men to animals.
Which, let' s face it, sometimes they are.
But sometimes they are not.
Sometimes you open the barn door, or the hospital room door...... or the bedroom door...... and you find the real thing.
You find a guy who...... sits with you when you' re at your worst, knee- deep in Kleenex...... and your face looks like a punching bag and you' re a mess...... and he can still look at you and tell you...... that Ray is not the last man you' re ever going to love.
Eddie.
Jane, you all right?
Eddie!
Eddie!
Eddie!
Eddie!
Stop!
So, what you see is what you get?
Minus a few gray hairs and a Ph. D., yeah.
I' m really sorry, Eddie.
- You should have told me.
- I should' ve told you a lot of things.
You were right.
It was about my nature.
Of everything you said to me that night, what scared me most...... is that I would find it again.
Because I have.
Would you please say something?
No.
So you' re saying....
What have we got to lose?
- Everything?
- Exactly.
Never found out why you left him
One more point of contention
I need some intervention
Are you sure you don' t wanna go to my room?
Why?
My roommate' s already moved out.
We' il be all alone.
All right.
The door is locked.
Relax.
Okay, yeah, sure.
No strings attached, okay?
It' s just friendly good- bye sex.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, right.
Uh, yeah, but you see, it' s just that, um, we' ve never even had friendly hello sex.
So do you not wanna do this?
Yeah.
No, I definitely do.
Well, not my first.
So, technically, that' s my second time.
So if I' m not up to par, performance- wise --
Jim, this isn' t exactly a turn- on.
I mean, girls like a guy with confidence.
Hey, I' m confident.
Yeah.
Let' s get naked.
Okay.
- Mm- hmm.
- We popped a couple of beers, and he said, "Now, you' re a man."
And today I get to say the same thing to my son.
Honey, your speeches embarrass him.
So, try and do what the kids say, and just... be cool.
I think I bring new meaning to the word "cool," honey.
That' s his dormitory up ahead.
Okay.
Ow.
Can' t bring alcohol in the dorms.
Oh, uh, good.
Thank you, uh, Matt.
I' m just here to surprise my son Jim.
Now pin my leg up.
What?
Pin my leg up, like this.
Uh- huh.
Oh, yeah.
Maybe you can help me out, you know.
Okay.
Is that the one?
No.
Oh, yeah, yeah!
I didn' t do this for you.
Thanks, dude.
Where' s my big guy?
Oh, my God!
- Jim, we got here a little early.
- Dad, get out!
Go, Dad!
Oh, my -- Geez.
Was that your dad?
- I' m so sorry.
- For your own edification, son, I just -- I' m not embarrassed.
- I am!
- It' s a perfectly normal thing for two --
- Dad, what are you doing?
Your mother and I -- Well, not so much anymore.
- No!
No, no.
I' m gonna take her --
Please just go!
Actually, if you wouldn' t mind.
Honey -- I' il take her to the car.
What?
- Natalie!
- I' m Jim' s dad.
You must be the parents of this young lady.
I' m sorry I didn' t get her name, but hopefully my son did... because I have not been here the whole time. because I have not been here the whole time.
Natalie, get dressed!
- Beer?
Turn around!
You don' t believe in locks?
Oh, my God.
Heya, fuckface.
- Mornin ', dude.
It' s show time.
Ozzy, before you go to Ann Arbor to pick up Heather, I wanna show you what you' re missing.
See what they are today, dude.
See what they are today.
Okay, here we go.
Moment of truth.
Ooh!
Super.
Look.
What the fuck, man?
Come on!
One.
You' re a disgrace to men everywhere.
Look at the Stifmeister.
I got laid 23 times this year, and I' m not counting the hummer I got in the library stacks, baby.
All right, here' s a new idea for you, Stifler, okay?
You don' t bother counting how many times you have sex with each other.
- You just laugh at the people that do count.
- Here' s a new idea for you.
I' il get you a spoon so you can eat my ass.
Okay, people.
Let' s get this exam rolling.
We got an exam today?
Yes!
I can' t believe I' m doing this summer abroad thing.
Last thing I need is more classes.
You' re gonna have a great time.
Hello, summer!
Did that exam blow or what?
Yeah, it sucked.
Ozzy!
Kev, what' s up, man?
Good.
We got 12 weeks of immortality ahead.
Yes, sir!
Weird.
Ah, the one that got away, huh, son?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, evidently you two made quite the handsome couple on the Internet.
Oh, I didn' t see it.
It, uh, was brought up at a P. T. A. meeting.
Anyway, my point is, these little sexual debacles should not get you down, because you know what?
It happens to the best of us.
In fact, the first time your mother and I... got together,
I used a condom.
Well, she referred to it as "shrink wrapping."
But I got over it.
Anyway, keep your chin up.
You keep plugging... and, uh, good things will happen.
Good to have you home, son.
It' s good to be home, Dad.
It' s gonna be nice to hit Stifler' s tonight after exams.
Did you get through 'em?
There' s the mystery man!
Finch, how are you?
Kevin.
James.
It means "hello."
- Finch, what happened to Latin?
- I met a Japanese girl at the art museum.
Changed majors.
Wanted to understand all those things she was moaning.
- You got laid in an art museum?
- Oh, and the Guggenheim with Francesca.
- The Guggenheim?
And then my social- psych professor in Baskin- Robbins.
- But I' il tell you, none of these women... even compare to --
Stifler' s mom.
Stifler' s mom is a goddess.
How about some more of Stifmeister' s collegiate concoction?
This thing is like half alcohol.
You' re just trying to get me drunk.
Mary, would I do that?
My name' s Christy.
Like it matters.
Hey, how you doing?
Hey.
Howdy- howdy, fuckin 'partners!
Johnny C., how' s it going?
Good to see you.
This' il help.
You' re an asshole.
Missed you too.
All right, everybody having a good time?
Fellas!
Enjoy.
Ladies, I' m Steve Stifler and I have an 11 - inch penis... around!
Think about it.
Come on, man.
All right.
- Yes, I am.
- Well, thank you for throwing this awesome party, man.
- No problem.
- Yeah, the cops bust all our parties now.
Well, I put the word out... so high- school chicks would come.
- Sure, son.
Go suck some dick!
Back at Stifler' s.
Hey, I remember you.
Oh, do you now?
You' re that guy who blew his load on the Internet.
"Oh, wait, Nadia, don' t go." Splat.
It' s exactly like old times.
I' m gonna miss you.
I' il miss you.
I' il call you when I get in, okay?
Go have fun.
Bye.
Bye- bye.
I can' t believe those two girls, Kevin.
Jim, it' s not a big deal.
Yeah.
They toyed with my emotions.
Hello.
See?
There' s other girls.
- How are ya?
- You got nothing to worry about, man.
Hey, Jessica' s here.
With Vicky.
And Vicky got... hot!
What' s that supposed to mean?
Look at her.
Yeah, Jim, I see her.
Hey, Kevin.
I' il be right back.
Hey, Vic, how are you?
What' s up?
I' m okay.
Yeah, I' m good.
That' s good.
Yeah, you too.
And I would know.
She' s right.
Why is this so weird?
Actually, l- I have no idea.
See, I knew it.
You know, and we could still be friends, right?
Yeah.
Whoa.
Friends, right?
Yeah, right.
I mean, I know you said friends and I -- I just --
I' m sorry.
- Are you sure?
- Vic, why wouldn' t I wanna be friends with you?
Look, we' il -- we' il just do this, okay?
My man!
Listen up!
Ozzy, I' m lobbing you a softball here.
Listen, I have a girlfriend.
Tantra.
- Just relax.
- You get out of my house!
Jesus Christ!
Come back here, you little fucker!
Hey!
Easy!
That' s enough.
- You touch me, I bite.
- You two relax and shake hands.
Hey.
Finch.
I need a drink.
Why is everybody taking a piss right now?
I ain' t gonna make it, man.
You' il be okay.
Hey, bro.
Hey, man, you' re the guy who boned Stifler' s mom.
Hey, you are a god.
Holy shit, dude.
If I didn' t have to hold my dick 'cause I gotta piss so bad, I would shake your hand.
I' m honored, guys.
Don' t leave.
You must teach me.
Oh, look what I found, Christy.
Oh, what a coincidence.
I' ve been saving this for a special occasion... for a special girl, just like you.
You' re so sweet.
That' s what they say.
Oh, weird.
Oh, my God.
I spilled some on you.
Maybe I should mop that up.
Thanks.
No problem.
Whoa, hey.
You know, they warn us about these situations in college.
Oh, yeah.
Are you certain that you wish to engage in "consensing" --
Hey, don' t count your chickens, buster.
I' m just playing by the rules, baby.
I make the rules.
That' s a pretty good fucking rule.
I' il never make it.
It' s gotta happen now.
Go, bro.
Clamp it off.
- Oh, Laurie.
How are you?
- Good.
- Why don' t you go downstairs and get us a couple beers?
- I' ve got a surprise for you.
- Why don' t you go downstairs and get us a couple beers?
- I' ve got a surprise for you.
Yeah, all right.
Mmm.
Okay, go.
Ohhh!
That' s it.
Bathe the Stifmeister.
Oh, that' s great!
How did you get it so nice and warm?
Actually, I can' t.
Much better.
Wait a second.
Thanks, man.
Christy?
Oh, what a "milf."
We' re definitely not those guys.
- All right!
Party' s over.
Ostreicher, Meyers.
- Welcome back.
- Where' s Steve Stifler?
I got peed on.
We can' t party anywhere anymore.
And things are --
Getting weird?
First summer back from college.
Yep, things are gonna get weirder.
- What are you talkin 'about?
- Well, times change, people change.
It' s just what happens, you know.
My friends and I knew that it was up to us to stick together.
We rented that lake house in Grand Harbor.
We treated every day out there like it was a post- prom party.
We capped it all off with a massive blowout.
My advice is do that.
By the end of the summer, you' re gonna see the big picture.
I love adventure Nothing' s better to me
She' s on the phone.
Nadia!
Nadia!
Here.
Wait.
Yes, I am sure to go see the Lion King.
Right.
Okay.
- He' s right -- Hang on.
Hey -- Hey, Nadia.
How was college?
Yeah, it was -- it was really excellent.
You have not forgotten about me, have you?
I, uh -- Absolutely not.
I definitely didn' t.
Good, because guess what?
I' m coming to see you at the end of summer.
I hope you' re ready for me... because I have not forgotten about you either, you sexy boy.
Shit.
Jim, you can eat hot dogs tomorrow.
No, no, Finch, it' s not the hot dogs.
Nadia called me this morning.
She' s coming here at the end of the summer and she wants to see me.
- Oh, that' s killer.
- Yeah, that' s a good thing.
No, not "good thing."
Not "killer."
I' il never be able to do it.
Nadia is gonna be expecting filet mignon.
Okay, and all I' m gonna be able to give her... is rump roast.
Jim, you' ve had experience since Nadia.
Ah, yes, you would be referring to... the flute- fetish band geek that made me her bitch and then ditched me after prom.
Yes, that' s great experience.
That' s the one.
Ah, you just gotta find the right girl, Jimbo.
I had the right woman.
She just sells her cottage and takes off to parts unknown.
Oh, my romantic life has past its peak.
Take me out to the pasture and shoot me.
Super start to a super summer, fellas.
Welcome home.
Guys, I got it.
Pack your bags.
- For what?
- We' re moving to the lake.
We' re gonna be the shit.
Everybody on the beach is gonna know us.
Plenty of opportunities to practice for Nadia.
Throw a huge party at the end of the summer to cap it all off.
Dude, that' s a great idea.
That way we' il be able to welcome Heather back... and we' il be able to prepare for Nadia' s big arrival.
This is it.
This is my summer of love.
Just thought I' d say good- bye to you animals.
How are you, sir?
- All packed up I see.
- Yeah, we' re all set, Dad.
Don' t worry, okay?
I' il be fine.
Come on and give your old man a hug.
- Keep it real, homies.
- You too, sir.
Have a good summer.
All right, let' s go.
- Not on summer jobs.
- Well, I kind of thought of that.
Oh, yeah!
The Stifmeister' s coming back to Grand Harbor!
Wipe my ass and lick my balls!
Whoo- hoo- hoo!
Stifler, if you' re gonna be living with us you gotta behave yourself.
All right, you and Finch just stay out of each other' s way.
Kevin, Stifler' s stench is unavoidable.
Finch, fist yourself.
That' s right, baby.
We' re here.
Yeah, baby, we' re here!
Whoo- hoo- hoo!
Cutting people down is just a minor offense
I' m sick of being told to wait my turn
I don' t wanna waste my time
I' il never fall in line
It' s a palace.
Isn' t this great?
Guys.
Will you idiots tell me what this fucker' s doin '?
Don' t touch me while I' m tantric.
"Tantric"?
What the fuck is tantric?
It' s a Buddhist discipline.
When you can do that, you can have sex for hours, even days.
- And this stuff' s for real?
- It' s been around for centuries.
With tantra you can make an entire session of sex... feel like one giant orgasm.
Eventually, you can sustain that feeling by meditating.
Well, maybe you can teach me sometime?
Very doubtful.
True.
Come on, Jim.
You can' t possibly be that bad.
Oh, no?
No way.
Well, I guess there' s only one person that really knows for sure, huh?
Oh, yeah?
Where' s she this summer?
Hey, are you here for the mid- session performance?
Guests go in the amphitheater.
You can' t be here.
Do you know where I could find Michelle Flaherty?
Guests bring food.
Food attracts animals.
This one time, a bear came, and then the bear had to be destroyed, which means they shot it in the head with a rifle and killed it and it died.
You must know Michelle.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
That' s a lot of flutes.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Have fun at your next class.
Hey, Michelle.
Jim.
Everybody stick together.
You' re really here?
Oh, shoot!
We' re -- We' re not supposed to have visitors,
'cause this one time, uh... here, this kid had these cookies -- this kid had these cookies --
Let me guess.
A bear came.
It' s like you know all our stories.
Was that a question?
I don' t know.
Maybe.
Do you wanna answer it anyway?
I left you like, uh -- like three messages after prom.
Really?
You didn' t think I was weird because of the way I acted that night?
Weird, no.
Surprising, yes.
I get nasty when I' m horny.
That' s kind of why I' m here.
Um, you remember, was I any good... that- that night?
Oh, wow.
Geez.
How could I forget?
You sucked.
You didn' t know what the hell you were doing.
"Terrible"?
Oh.
Oh, sorry.
I --
Oh.
Oh, shoot.
Okay, wait here.
I' il meet you in an hour, okay?
Yeah.
- Ow!
- Ooh.
Ooh.
You' re all right.
Here we go.
You know you' re not supposed to be here now.
Everyone' s supposed to be in the amphitheater.
It' s piss- poor to be this late.
I' m very angry right now.
You can tell by the tone of my voice I' m angry.
I' m pissed off is what I am.
Cut 'em off.
Wait a minute.
Petey?
Uh, yeah, sure.
Petey!
Well, that explains everything.
Well, it' s always something with these kids.
Petey, we are just so thrilled to have you.
None of my kids are at your caliber.
Watch that.
But we are just so overjoyed to have someone with your kind of talent here.
Oh, great.
Here you go.
That' s great.
Oh, look at this.
Your old best friend.
I know it' s not yours, but you are going to make beautiful music.
This is fantastic.
I' m very excited.
You just own this and break a leg.
All right, all right.
- Who knows?
I' il tell you something.
I' m about fed up with these Tall Oaks North kids.
Kids, entertain yourselves.
Play along with Petey.
No, no, no, no, Petey.
Here we go.
All right, all right.
Come on, now.
Right to this spot.
Folks, he' s just a little nervous.
This isn' t right.
Just blow on it, kid.
All right.
Here we go.
Uh -- Come on, Petey.
Play!
Do something.
Special, my ass.
Come on.
Give the little guy some support.
Come on, Petey.
You' re doing great, partner.
Come on, honey.
You can do it.
Come on, Petey.
Oh, what the hell.
All right, Petey!
Thank you, Tall Oaks.
You' re beautiful.
My name is Petey!
And I have gigantic balls!
- Michelle -- - Not now!
Go!
Come back here!
You are so sweet.
He is... special.
He' s my bitch.
I suck.
Don' t worry about it.
I mean, that' s why we got the house, Jimbo.
Fellas, nice pad.
Good view, but... the Sherminator sensors detect no female life- forms in the vicinity.
I made some calls.
Yeah.
The Sherminator' s got a point, Kev.
Since when do you start listening to the Sherminator?
Since he made me realize there' s an abundance of wiener here.
I mean, look around, dude.
All right, now it' s your turn.
There' s nothing to tell.
Hey, what' s up?
What are you guys talking about?
You know, we' re just trading war stories about college -- who hooked up with who, who slept with who --
Well, there was this one guy.
How 'bout you?
Oh, you know, there was a few girls -- three.
Ooh, look at you.
You stud.
All right, Oz.
Now that Kevin told us, what about you?
You haven' t had the slightest bit of attraction to any girl at school?
Don' t you fuckin 'say no.
I know you did.
Even if I did, it wouldn' t be anything more than just a momentary thing.
Very... uninteresting.
And how about you, Jessica?
- How many chicks did you sleep with this year?
- Gee, wouldn' t you like to know.
- Fuck yeah, I would.
- Come on, Ozzy.
Poo" s yours.
- Hey, Vic, you wanna play?
- Yeah, sure.
What the --
Jim, can' t you leave your shirt on?
Ozzy, go deep.
Yeah, bro.
You playing?
No.
No, no, keep going.
Flag pattern.
- What are you doin '?
- Fishin '.
Are you okay?
- You okay?
- Oh, man, I' m so sorry.
Is everybody okay?
- Yes.
The Force is strong in that one.
The Sherminator detects serious heat at a distance of two meters.
Prepare to deploy beer.
Sherman, dude,
let me give you a valuable piece of advice, okay?
Please repeat previous statement.
Look, I know your last name is Sherman, right?
And that rhymes with The Terminator which was a big hit movie ten years ago.
But you can' t tell me a gir" s ever really gone for it.
System overload.
Hasta la vista, Jessica.
What a freak.
Vic, hey, you guys are leaving?
You know, we barely had a chance to hang out, you know, catch up.
Well, what are you doing this weekend?
Cool.
Let' s hang out.
All right.
Bye, Kev.
See ya, Jess.
No, no, that' s all wrong.
Have a nice day.
Good- bye.
So what does he mean, "meet up"?
You know, like hang out, grab lunch, whatever.
I told you, we' re just friends now.
And he totally understands.
He does.
Oh, no, sir.
I mean, seriously.
Well, we' re friends.
Right.
I don' t see her with a boyfriend.
I think that puts me on deck.
- Hey, Vicky only slept with one guy since we went out.
I mean, that like makes me 50% of her entire guy- related life.
You dipshit.
She didn' t sleep with one guy.
She slept with at least three.
- What?
- When a girl tells you how many guys she slept with, multiply it by three and that' s the real number.
Didn' t you fuckers learn anything at college?
Look, he did not sleep with three girls, okay?
Kevin Meyers did not sleep with three girls at Michigan.
But why would he lie to me?
It' s not a lie.
The rule of three.
Three.
A guy tells you how many girls he' s hooked up with, it' s not even close to that.
Then you get the real total.
So, if Kevin' s saying it' s been three girls, it' s more like one, or none.
- None?
- Rule of three.
It' s an exact science, consistent as gravity.
Ozzy, I' m happy for you.
La, la, la.
"Ooh, hey.
Hot Spanish guy.
Love your accent.
Love your ding- dong. "
Guys!
You know, Mr. Homophobic Wizard, that it is possible for women to hold hands and not be gay.
Friends can hold hands.
Hey, Finch, I don' t wanna hear about you and your boyfriends.
Go jerk off.
Unnecessary.
Tantra teaches you to hold an orgasm over time... in anticipation of an ultimate moment... to release it upon the world.
I' m filling up to the brim.
That' s fucking disgusting!
Oh, I' m gonna throw up.
- Hello?
You' re in!
- Oz!
- How' s the studying going?
I' d hardly call it studying.
I' ve been going to the Picasso Museum, hanging out at Sagrada Familia, going with Pierre to the Parc Guell.
Hey, who' s Pierre?
He' s got a girlfriend back in France, so we' ve kind of got something in common.
Ah, that sounds cool.
Yeah, I' ve overheard them on the phone at night.
And, uh, well, it made me think.
Hey, Oz, I' m reaching under my shirt, and I' m rubbing myself.
Oh ho ho ho!
It' s phone sex.
Yeah.
And I' m slowly... reaching downstairs.
Tell me how big it is.
Listen, Heather, I' m feeling kind of awkward.
If we can' t physically be with each other, then we have to learn to be more vocal.
Okay.
Okay, here we go.
I' m reaching in my pants now.
And I' m rubbing it for you, Heather.
Yeah, me too.
Oh, yeah.
Hello?
Hello.
All right, look, man.
I got my hand on my dick right now, okay, and I' m trying to have sex with my girlfriend over the phone.
Hey.
Where were we?
I think you were reaching for something.
Oh, yeah, Heather.
I' m rubbing it and it feels so good.
What else do you want me to do?
Oh, Heather, baby.
- Stifler, get off!
- I am getting off just listening to the two of you.
- Keep going.
- I think we should try this another time.
Yeah, all right.
- I love you.
- Come on, you guys.
Repressed.
Repressed.
Check it out.
Potential lesbians leaving the building.
Now is my chance.
I need confirmation.
Hey, man, what are you doing?
- You ass.
Stifler, get out.
Stifler?
I found a dildo!
- Big blue rubber dicks for everyone!
- Finch, help.
- Finch, help.
Dildo, dildo, dildo!
- What are you doing?
- I' m looking for more lesbian artifacts.
Finch' s ass.
Shit!
Stall 'em!
Come on.
- Come on.
Come on.
- This is awesome!
Danielle, Amber, hi.
Mm- hmm.
I can' t remember shit.
I was too excited.
- I' m in a lesbian stronghold.
- Shit, man.
What do you mean "maybe"?
Was it or was it not here?
Happy painting, boys.
They' re inside.
Oh, shit balls.
- Very original, Steven.
- Don' t call me Steven.
It' s so cute on you.
Okay.
Thanks.
- Hey, have I shown you my cute little pink shoes?
They' re getting naked.
- Oh, shit.
They can' t hear us inside?
We won' t cross over their radio or anything?
These work on a C. B. frequency.
Two possible lesbians in their bras and panties.
- Lesbians?
Did you say lesbians?
Don' t touch me.
I' m not.
This is not gonna fit.
Too big.
I' il get you the blue stringy number.
Johnny West is missing.
Maybe you kicked it under the bed.
- Okay, let me look.
Didn' t you have it when we were downstairs?
Oh, maybe.
Guys, get the hell out of there right now.
Come on.
Come on.
Go, go, go!
Oh, I' m just so glad I found him.
I know.
I just remembered.
Holy shit!
There' s a dildo in my drawer.
What the hell was that?
Call 9 11.
Don' t call the police.
I' m still calling the cops.
Okay, no, no, no.
This isn' t right.
Okay, look.
But we just followed him in to get him out.
I just wanted proof that you chicks are really lesbians.
You wanna mess with 'em?
Let' s do it.
Let' s do it.
You guys... like that?
Ozzy, stand by for confirmation.
That' s a big 10- 4 on the confirmation.
Sounds like your little friends outside wanna play too.
You won' t be needing this.
Who wants me to touch Amber?
- I do, I do.
- Who the hell is that?
Uh, this is John...
Smith.
I' m turning off my radio now.
Okay.
Ass, baby.
Feel that ass!
That' s nice.
Oooh.
I know.
You feel his ass first.
Excuse me?
That' s good.
Yeah, so I got some painting I should, uh -- It' s --
Jim, hold on.
I can handle it.
What?
And I would love to see that show.
One finger... on the cheek.
No, no, no.
- Squeeze his ass, son.
Oh, shit.
Mommy!
You can go.
I' m staying.
Danielle is feeling my breasts.
No way, dude!
What a wonderful Christmas gift you bought the boys.
Your turn.
Oh, yeah!
No, no, no.
Kiss.
Oh, yeah.
Go get him, tiger.
- Do it for us.
- That doesn' t even count.
- That totally counted.
- That totally counted.
- Don' t you say anything!
Promise.
I promise.
I wouldn' t lie.
Come on.
Ooh!
Very good.
Dude, you' re a fuckin 'lousy kisser.
What?
I wasn' t trying!
That' s not fair!
Nope.
Wait a second.
You were trying?
Fuck no!
You were trying!
Silence.
Silence.
Silence!
As you were.
Amber!
I' m not hungry!
I can' t --
I can' t believe it.
Oh.
It was worth it.
Oh!
Uh, Amber.
Okay, I think that' s enough.
That' s good.
I want more.
Yeah.
I want more, too, baby.
- Okay!
We love to watch.
You go.
Don' t be a wimp.
It' s okay.
I know what I have to do.
I' m takin 'one for the team.
Mother of God!
Come on, you pussies.
We had 'em.
I am not touching that.
Put that thing away, Stifler.
Why can' t you guys be team players, huh?
Whoo!
Amber, let me try that dildo.
Now wait just a minute.
Stifler wanted one from us.
- What?
- No, he did, okay?
Just watching the game, Kev.
Hey, I just wanna do something together.
We just did something together.
Very together.
Ho ho ho.
- Oh, yeah!
- Really?
- That' s Stifler' s mom.
- Silence.
Yeah, you' re more than welcome to be here.
Okay, stop by in a couple of weeks.
We' re having a big party.
Okay, bye.
Uh, Stifler, was that --
Okay.
She' s coming.
Stifler' s mom is coming here.
Efforts must be doubled.
Absolutely.
Jenny, where' d you put my clarinet?
I think I shoved it in your box.
Oh, thanks!
I' m a bad, bad man.
Hi.
Jim, what are you doing here?
I, uh -- uh -- Well, I thought you had said --
You can' t just stand out here.
Look, uh, I need your help.
Nadia' s coming back, and I don' t --
I don' t wanna be this awkward, bumbling, nervous guy with her.
Well, I know that feeling.
Spend your life playing in the band, it doesn' t exactly give you the ultra- cool hipster image.
I think you' re pretty cool.
Seriously?
Yeah.
Michelle, why did you ditch me after prom?
I didn' t ditch you.
Our date was over.
I mean, did you want some... funky, weird, next- morning good- bye?
It' s not like I wanted you to pretend you were in love with me or something.
Why would I pretend that?
Guys do that.
Yeah, well, I' m not like other guys.
I know.
Okay, I' m gonna help you.
Really?
Oh.
Uh, I' m just --
Let' s just get started.
Okay.
Now, I' m a hot girl.
Right.
I wanna feel your boobs.
You don' t just go groping away.
You don' t just go groping away.
You gotta preheat the oven before you stick in the turkey.
Okay.
Good.
Okay, now, the collarbone -- kiss.
Good, Jim.
Oh, you' re making me wet.
Holy shit.
Really?
No, I was just saying that so you could practice.
That was good.
Let' s work on something else.
Does direction matter -- like clockwise, counterclockwise -- make a difference?
Okay, Jim, this is what I' m talking about.
Your main problem is... you' re so uptight.
Do I seem uptight about my sexual stuff?
No.
Hmm?
- Ohh!
Now, this is a fucked- up situation.
What happened to preheating?
We' re skipping a few chapters.
Oh, okay.
This is good.
This is good.
Gilligan' s Island, Mr. Howell.
Wh- What?
You' ve got to control yourself and think of something nonsexual.
I haven' t even touched you yet, and you' re turning into the Sears Tower.
I' m sorry.
Yeah, uh, nonsexual.
Right, right.
Chairs.
Chairs.
Uh, uh -- Good.
Cleaning my bathroom.
Dung beetles.
Good.
Okay.
Okay --
Oh, that' s cold!
What are you doing?
I just shoved a trumpet in your ass.
Aren' t instruments fun?
Okay, I think you' ve just crossed my threshold.
We gotta go!
Okay.
Pointer -- less tongue.
There he is.
"A night not soon to be forgotten.
August '93. "
It' s your brother, man.
Yeah, his cottage was right down on the beach.
Guys, this is what our party' s gotta be.
- You go fish.
Gin.
- You' re always there - Huh!
I' m not alone
I' m not alone
I try to wash the pain away from me
Away from me
"Dear 'Jeem.'
Love, Nadia. "
"Apply a few drops to achieve desired lubrication."
All right.
Is that a loofah, or are you just glad to see me?
God!
Oh.
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!
Ow!
Everybody okay?
I' m fine.
Everything' s fine.
Shut the fuck up, or I' il break down this door and pummel your ass!
No, don' t come in here.
Okay.
Oh!
Shit!
Oh, shit!
Ow!
Poison control.
Uh, yeah.
Ow.
Don' t, uh, don' t send an ambulance.
Look, is there anything, uh, you know, around the house?
Paint thinner.
Shit.
Don' t move!
Stay where you are!
Hands where we can see 'em!
Both hands!
Get the other hand up, goddamn it!
I can' t!
I can' t!
I' m glued!
I' m glued!
Sorry.
I' il take it from here, okay?
You' re gonna be fine, buddy.
Jim, this happens to the best of us.
Left foot first.
Good.
- Watch your head.
- Ahh!
Fuck, no!
This is just too good to miss!
Oh.
Excuse me?
Oh, well, we' re sorry.
Thank you, Dad.
Because you don' t have a penis.
Or maybe you do!
Boy, that doesn' t look too bad, Jim.
Good job, Doctor.
Beach party' s in a week.
Nadia' s coming.
Oh.
Doctor, my- my son has a party in seven days, and there' s a young lady coming... that he' s been waiting to -- he' s been waiting to get with.
Believe me, I will be doing that.
But if his pants... decide to come off during the party, could he have full use of his, um, penis?
Okay.
This should shave a couple of days off.
Oh, good.
Thank you, Doctor.
Jim, that' s good news.
This has been a good- news day, son.
Put this on.
Little chilly out there.
Well, here we are.
I think we should keep your mother in the dark about the incident tonight.
I think the whole glue thing might get her a little queasy.
I don' t know how I get myself into these things.
But thanks for understanding.
You' ve been really cool.
I mean, between this and, you know --
You know, you may be Jimbo or Jumbo... or Jimbodinny to these guys in here, but I want you to know there are two people... who still remember where James Emanuel Levenstein came from.
We' re awful proud of you, son.
Thanks, Dad.
That was a pure tantric moment.
The ficus, the water -- it was all erotic.
One more stimulant, I would have had full release.
Finch, stay the fuck away from that ficus.
- That' s a jizz- free ficus.
There he is.
Morning, Jimbo.
How' s the twig and giggleberries, man?
Oh, very colorful.
My dick looks like a paint- by- numbers.
Jim, you' re the only guy I know whose dick needs an instruction manual.
Casa de Stifler.
Oh, hey.
What, you' re here now?
No, that' s cool.
You know, if you want to hang out with these guys.
Okay, then.
I' il meet you out front.
- Hey, Stifler, was that -- - Eat shit, Shitbrick.
She' s here.
My lady has arrived.
I gotta prepare.
Here we go.
Great.
Stifler' s mom is here?
This could be a disaster.
Not unless Stifler' s mom drives a moped.
Moped?
Fuckers, fuckers, fuckers.
How you doin ', boys?
- That' s Stifler' s little brother.
- What are you doing here?
Pussy, man.
I' m here for the pussy.
Take a number.
Everybody knows that this is my special day.
- What is that?
Are you wearing a dress?
Shitbrick, meet my little brother.
Little brother, meet Shitbrick.
- That' s your brother?
- Yes.
My lady' s not coming.
So my entire... stockpile is wasted, and I look ridiculous!
Excuse me.
That didn' t look too good.
No.
Let' s go find your room.
So, where are the fuckin 'females?
I can' t believe I finally got you alone.
That only took, what, six weeks?
So, uh, are you alone too?
- Yep.
- Good.
I' m all alone.
Guess what I had in mind?
Hey, Marco, can you get your balls off me?
- Thanks.
- Heather, what the hel" s going on over there?
I guess this is kind of a lost cause, huh?
I can' t wait.
See ya this weekend?
- I can' t wait either.
- Bye- bye.
- Surprise!
- Holy -- Nadia!
You' re here?
You' re here.
What are you doing here?
Jim, I got so tired of sightseeing.
But you' re -- you' re early.
Okay.
Nice to know you.
I will leave.
No!
Uh, don' t -- don' t leave.
No leaving.
It' s just, I' m not gonna be ready --
I mean, the party won' t be ready, uh, until Saturday.
I can... stay here until then?
Yeah.
Is that okay?
Okay.
Who' s in my room.
Now.
Holy shit.
Okay.
How about I come back with you... and you say, 'Hello, this is Michelle, my girlfriend. "
And obviously, Nadia won' t expect you to hop in the sack.
And then we break up the day of the party.
And you' re all healed and back on the market.
- You' re evil.
- No way!
I' m like Cupid.
And I know how to make a girl jealous.
This is gonna be fun.
I' m sorry I didn' t tell you sooner, but we just started seeing each other a few weeks ago.
Um -- But I' d really love it... if you stayed here.
I think you should stay and have fun at the party.
Good for you, Jim.
That' s grea -- Aiee!
That' s my nipples!
She just loves my nipples.
But you' re a little on the strange side
I can' t lie
I want you bad
Complete me Mistreat me
So long
I want you bad
Bad, bad Oh, no.
You still broken?
No.
Jim, what' s the big deal with Nadia, anyway?
I mean, okay, so she' s 50, 000 times hotter... than most girls, but... come on, it' s just sex.
Oh, no.
You saw the thing on the Internet.
Did it look like I might have had... a slight interest in Nadia then?
Add another year to that.
Okay.
Hey, why don' t you bring Nadia to the concert first?
It' il be a cool date.
We' il see how things go.
Michelle, you have been great.
Thank you.
Come on.
You ready to break up?
You big, stupid dummy!
Theater is so cool!
I don' t care if you are the best lay I' ve ever had in my life.
I hate your guts anyway.
Don' t say that.
And I don' t care if you did give me ten orgasms in a row, because you smell really bad.
I smell really bad!
Because we' ve been having so much sex, and -- and I haven' t showered, and I wanna shower!
So, don' t you go being all super- sexy guy anymore, because I am now impervious... to your unrelenting machismo and sexual ardor.
And that includes fucking me in the ass!
So there!
We had something special.
What' s up?
What' s up, dog?
Hey.
I' m so glad you came.
You want something to drink or -- Hey.
Can I help you?
Kevin.
That' s my date.
What?
You -- You saved them all.
How sweet.
You don' t think I' m a dork?
Whatever you are, Jim, it is what I like.
Kevin left.
Didn' t look good.
Kevin left?
Just wandered down the beach.
You okay, Kev?
Wanna tell us what' s up?
Wanna feel Finch' s ass?
No, I -- I went to say hi to Vicky, and she was there with a date.
You hooked up with three girls this year.
You' re doing fine.
Rule of three, Oz.
You remember that day after prom?
You know, we made a toast to the next step.
I guess I never took it.
My brother said that by the end of the summer I' d see the big picture.
And I see it.
No matter what, times change and things are different.
The problem is, I don' t want them to be.
You know, Kevin, I haven' t moved on either.
I' ve been obsessed with the one woman I can' t have a real future with, other than a very kinky, extremely warped one.
I gotta find a new goddess.
It' s gonna take patience, but I' ve been celibate all summer.
Yeah, you kinda get used to it, though, huh?
Are you insane?
Hey, look, Kev, different does not necessarily mean worse.
As a matter of fact, I think things are just getting better.
Or am I gonna have to drag your ass back to that party and prove it to you?
I' il walk.
Wow!
You know, you have beautiful eyes.
- Oh, you' re sweet.
Oh.
Thanks.
You' re welcome.
- Wanna fuck?
- Are you serious?
Come on, baby.
Give it to the Stifmeister.
Wow.
You know, you have beautiful eyes.
Come here, dude.
You' re ruining my mojo.
And you' re not the Stifmeister, okay?
It takes years to develop true Stifmeister style.
Come on, man!
I just wanna see some boobs.
Hey, Pop- Tart.
Excuse him.
Come here.
Go out in the driveway.
See any cops, call me, okay?
Steve -- All right.
Gentlemen, uh, this appears to be a party.
Guys, if you' il excuse me, I' m gonna go look for Nadia.
Good luck.
Ahh.
So what was this year like for you?
Did you miss high school?
Well, no.
When you travel as much as I do, you get used to moving on.
But I have great memories.
- Wow, can we go in there?
- The lighthouse?
Yeah.
Yes, we can.
How romantic.
Jim, come on.
Wow!
Wow!
Oh, it' s beautiful!
Cool!
Oh, uh --
You have not changed.
Jim, relax.
We are just, how do you say, tooting our horns.
Actually, that is quite difficult.
How do you mean?
Well, this one time at band camp,
Holy shit.
What?
Tell me.
Uh, well, uh, this one time at band camp,
I got stuck playing this trombone.
So I totally sucked.
And everyone thought I was this Petey guy, but I didn' t know what to think, so I just kept playing and playing, and I didn' t know what I was doing.
It was so funny!
What?
Why?
Nadia, please don' t take this the wrong way, but, but you' re -- you' re everything that I used to want.
And as much as I may really, really regret what I' m about to do, there' s somebody else I want to be with.
You- You want the band geek?
Nadia, I am a band geek.
I just never joined the band.
You go get your geek.
Someday I will find mine.
And the world is crashin '
I think about it
Hey, um, Kevin Meyers.
Sorry I was a dick before.
It' s okay, man.
My name' s Brett.
Uh, could you give us a sec?
Sure.
Look, you don' t have to do this.
Victoria,
Whoo!
Whoo!
Yeah!
- I don' t know.
From the lighthouse all the way -- - Hey, handsome.
Hey.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
I was gonna pick you up at the airport in, like, two hours.
I took an earlier flight, and I thought I' d surprise you.
Yeah, you did.
Kinda weird without the phone, huh?
We' il get used to it.
I wanna hear all about it.
We' il grab you a drink.
Steve, this cop- watch thing is horseshit.
Hello?
Man, this sucks.
Who is it out there?
It' s the Stifmeister, baby.
Is that so?
Life' s a bitch, isn' t it?
It' s all right.
I' m used to girls ignoring me.
Or making fun of me.
Be the Sherminator. "
Like the movie.
How clever.
l- I get it, okay?
Whatever.
Yes, you are!
All right.
I... am the Sherminator.
A sophisticated sex robot sent back through time... to change the future for one lucky lady.
I am lucky lady?
That' s right, Nadia.
You' ve been targeted for Shermination.
Come with me if you want to live.
Oh, no!
Help!
Help!
- Ohh!
Fuck me, geek!
- Affirmative!
No fuckin 'way!
Forget it.
Hey, Steve, look what I found.
- Dude, don' t touch the shirt.
- Just look.
Hi.
Brilliant.
You found lesbians.
Good luck trying to break through that force field.
Lesbians?
We never said that.
- What?
- We never said that.
Oh, man.
Okay?
Oh, yeah.
You heard me.
I' il kiss everybody here.
Dudes, chicks, everybody.
Because I am comfortable with my sexuality.
Oh, yeah.
At least have a drink with the Stifmeister.
All right.
That' s fair.
All right.
You truly are a Stifmeister.
- Welcome back to the party.
- Steve, those are my lesbians.
Ladies, I am down with the funky shit.
Like what?
One time at this party, I was drinking champagne --
Thank you.
Our next soloist will be Michelle Flaherty.
Petey?
This kid is killing me.
You suck, retard.
I' m not retarded.
I' m a very special boy.
- At night he lies awake and he wonders - Jim!
How' s this for a band camp story?
I would give anything just to live one day
Let' s hear it for Petey!
Oh, yeah
Falling into less
In dreams
And run away
Talented bastard!
Do it!
Do it!
Do it!
Do it!
Do it!
Do it!
Come on, baby!
Well, then I think it' s time that we took a break
Out of control.
Dude, am I gonna have a hangover?
'Cause I want one.
Dude, am I gonna have a hangover?
Oh, my gosh.
This party was crazy!
You drank him under the table.
He couldn' t hang out.
Quietly reeling
What she' s feeling
Oh!
Best summer ever, huh, fellas?
Things are great.
Oh, yeah, we are.
It is sweet.
Stifler' s mom.
Hey, Finchy.
How did you know I was here?
I called a couple of weeks ago.
Didn' t Steven tell you that I was gonna drop by sometime?
I guess it, uh, slipped his mind.
Jeanine.
Jeanine.
I' ve been thinking, and, you know, I' m 19 years old.
I can' t be obsessed with one woman.
- Just can' t be.
Uh, give me, like, uh, three days.
- Yeah.
Yeah!
I think it was.
Son of a --
Who the hell was that?
Lookin 'for the lake.
What a dumbass.
Dog Years awaits.
Everything in.
Yeah, I do.
Yeah, you do.
Let' s go!
Let' s go!
The movies.
Took the bus.
Wait a second.
Who the fuck was in that car?
And here' s to you Mrs. Robinson
Oh, Finchy, I missed you.
Oh, God.
Jeanine.
Jeanine.
Oh, Stifler' s mom!
I don' t want to be an ass anymore
That what I say is true
Too much lyin 'Too little tryin'
I say the last time again
What I say The last time again
Skipping like a broken record you can play again
But I' il do it all again
Tryin' to wash away the sin
I won' t do this anymore
Starting tomorrow
This time is gonna be the last time
What I say The last time again
That to the surface brings
Before the curtain call
Just to take a fall
Draggin' me down
Spinnin' me 'round
'Cause I don' t know if I' m alive or dead
There' s a dagger in my hand
Bleeding me dry
And all we have to lose
George, wake up.
It' s Saturday.
I know, but it' s the first day of soccer.
It' s our first game.
Soccer?
I can' t today.
I caught a cold while sleeping.
You' il be fine.
Come on, come on, it' il be great.
We' re going to play like Brazilians.
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Mom.
Stuart, don' t forget your water bottle.
Don' t forget your cleats.
You look especially beautiful today.
Some people just know how to wear oatmeal.
Okay, open up.
Did you hear that?
She said "blah- blah."
I can' t believe it.
Her first word.
Where' s the baby book?
I' m writing it down.
I' m not sure that' s technically a word.
Of course it is.
But your Uncle Crenshaw says that every Little starts talking by nine months.
In Uncle Crenshaw' s case, never stops.
Are you both coming to the game?
Wouldn' t miss it.
Frederick...... this soccer game' s making me very....
- Anxious.
Especially about....
- I' m fine.
- He' s fine.
All those boys stomping around with cleats.
What if someone....
Oh, honey.
He' s a Little.
All Littles are natural athletes.
- Do you need....
- Could you?
Okay, that' s it for you.
Snow, food.
Food?
Is it tuna?
Or herring?
Or, dare I say it, is it lox?
Oh!
Please be lox!
That' s for you.
- Boys, are we ready to play some soccer?
- You bet, Dad.
Oh, great.
It' s glop.
Look what I' m reduced to.
I' m a Handi Wipe with hair.
Wallace!
Get up!
There we go!
That' s right!
Dig!
Downfield!
You guys, spread out!
Spread out!
Well, George is getting a workout.
What bothers me is that every kid has had a chance to play except Stuart.
There' s plenty of time.
Plenty of time?
There' s 40 seconds.
He did an excellent job of handing out the orange slices.
That' s not as easy as it looks.
Okay, I' m glad he' s not in the game.
I don' t want him to get hurt.
It' s Pee- Wee soccer.
Nobody gets hurt.
Irwin, are you okay?
Are you all right, Irwin?
Do I look all right?
Here.
Come on.
Better substitute.
Tie game.
We could play with just 10.
But we have George, so it' s like having nine.
We' il have none of that.
Come on, coach.
Stuart!
Go in for Irwin!
Mom!
Dad!
I' m going in!
Yeah, Stuart!
Oh, dear.
Watch your tail out there.
Don' t worry, I won' t let you down.
Now, go get them.
Come on!
Over here!
I' m open!
I got it!
I got it!
- I' m going to snatch him off the field.
- Honey, honey.
Embarrassing.
Get it, George!
Go after it!
Pass me the ball, lame- o.
Come on.
George, shoot!
I got it!
I got it!
Shoot!
I got it!
I got it!
Yeah, I did it!
I have to start wearing a cup.
He just looked so small out there.
So lacking in bigness.
Does he really have to go back next week?
We have to give him room to grow.
I do.
I let him slice his own banana.
With a spoon.
I let him drive his car to school.
No other mother does that.
With George walking beside him every step of the way.
How much more room should I give him?
A bit more than you' re giving him now.
Maybe Mom was right.
Maybe I shouldn' t be playing soccer anymore.
What does she want you to go out for?
Painting or dancing.
I guess it' s my fault.
I' m sorry I kicked you into the goal.
That' s okay.
You won the game.
That' s the main thing.
No.
The main thing is I hit Wallace in the face.
Bogeys, 12: 00!
I got him, Brooklyn!
Wouldn' t it be cool if I actually flew this?
Yeah.
There' s only one problem.
Mom.
- Hello, Mrs. Little.
- Hi, Will.
- ls George home?
- He' s with Stuart.
We just need to tighten her up and she' s ready to fly.
Hi, George.
Hi, Stuart.
Hi, Will.
You want to take a break for a while?
I brought my PS2.
Yeah, okay.
But what about the plane?
I want to play with Will for a while.
Play with Snowbell.
Oh, well.
Guess I' il have to finish it myself.
If I can just....
Oh, dear.
Hey, what' s that noise?
Sounds like a lawnmower.
Inside the house?
Stuart!
What are you doing?
I' m not doing anything!
Pull the brake!
Get the book!
This is cool.
All my brother does is jam crayons up his nose.
It says, "On takeoff, pull back on the throttle."
Takeoff?
I' m in the air!
Snowbell, get out of the way!
Please, don' t hurt me!
What' s going on?
Stuart' s just flying in the house.
Flying in the house?
At least he' s indoors, nothing bad can happen.
Watch out!
Hit the dirt!
Stuart!
Duck!
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?
I' m okay.
Everything' s fine.
Fine?
Stuart, you destroyed it.
I' m sorry I wrecked it, George.
I' m sure we can fix it with some glue.
It' s much too dangerous.
Thanks, Stuart.
Why don' t you take the boys home?
I think Stuart and I need to have a talk.
Good idea.
Come on, boys.
Let' s go home.
She treats me like a baby.
I' il fix you both some lunch.
She just loves you so much.
It' s hard for her to think ofyou in danger.
Oh, this has been a bad day.
Mom' s mad, George won' t play with me....
I know.
But every cloud has a silver lining.
Doesn' t that make them kind of heavy?
No, it' s an expression, Stuart.
The thing about being a Little is that you can look at any situation...... no matter how bleak, how hopeless...... and still see the bright side.
Like in this situation, the silver lining would be....
Help me, Dad, because I' m struggling.
So you could find a newfriend, too.
You' re a lot better at this than I am.
I' ve been a Little a lot longer than you have.
You' il get the hang of it.
Meantime, keep your chin up...... your back straight and your heart open.
- Then what?
- One step at a time.
And Canada is separate from the United States because...... Canadians like to be alone.
Review tomorrow, test on Friday.
And please take your leftover lunches with you.
My husband is tired of me coming home smelling like salami.
Tony, would you like to come over to my house this afternoon?
I' ve got karate.
Hey, Mark.
Guitar lessons.
Some of the guys are going over to Will' s house to play basketball.
Can I come?
They didn' t exactly mention that you were invited.
Oh, that' s okay.
I' m busy anyway.
Just tell Mom I walked you home.
I owe you one.
Sure.
Miss?
Miss?
Are you alive?
She' s alive.
Out of the way, please.
Injured bird coming through!
What' s going on?
My wing.
Hey!
Where' s the falcon?
What falcon?
That falcon!
Drive!
Get out of here!
Oh, my!
Get lost, you disgusting vulture!
Eat my feathers, you vile buzzard!
Do we really want to antagonize him?
Oh, boy, we' ve got a problem.
No, you can make it.
Don' t slow down.
You did it.
Yeah.
I did.
So, who do I have to thank?
Forgive me.
My name is Stuart.
Stuart Little.
I' m Margalo.
Just Margalo.
Margalo.
You' re so strong.
Are you an athlete?
Well, yeah.
I play a little soccer...... fly airplanes...... race boats.
You can put me down now.
My legs are fine.
It' s my wing that' s hurt.
Yeah.
Of course.
There used to be bandages in here.
- Hey, why don' t we try your scarf?
- Good idea.
My pin, it' s....
Must have happened when that falcon smashed into me.
It was part of our nest when I was a baby.
I' ve had it my whole life.
It' s the only thing I have left of my mother' s.
Gee, that' s too bad.
Yeah.
There.
How' s that?
That' s much better, thank you.
So tell me, Stuart Little, do you actually live here?
Oh, yeah.
I' m a real Little.
I' m the middle child.
The middle Little.
Cute.
So, where do you live?
- You know, here and there.
- You mean you don' t have a home?
Once, we lived in a box.
It was one of those things where people keep their jewelry.
A jewelry box?
Yes!
That' s what it must have been.
A jewelry box.
It was wonderful.
Well, I' ve taken too much of your time.
I' d better go before it gets dark.
No, wait.
You can' t go out there.
Not while you' re hurt.
You should stay here.
I couldn' t impose.
I mean, you' d really do that for me?
Sure, I have just the thing.
I' il be right back.
- Meanwhile, you can use my cat' s bed.
- You have a cat?
Don' t worry about Snowbell.
He wouldn' t hurt a fly.
Those flies really come back on you.
I try to eat right and yet I still feel bloated.
Maybe more food will help.
Hi there.
Sorry.
Didn' t mean to scare you!
Scare me?
That' s a laugh.
Hear that?
That was a laugh.
Hairball.
Major hairball.
And yet we continue to lick ourselves.
Unbelievable.
Hey, Snowbell.
Meet Margalo.
She' il be staying with us for a while.
Staying?
Are you out of your mind?
You can' t just drag stray birds in here.
Do you think this is a halfway house?
Look, she' s filthy.
She could have germs.
And how do you know she' s not a vagrant or a thief?
Get rid of her.
We' re home.
Sorry we' re late.
What the heck was that?
That' s just how we greet each other.
Interesting.
Nauseating is more like it.
You' re in for it now, missy.
Mother Little hates when animals walk in here off the street.
When she sees this, she' s going to throw a fit.
Such a pretty little birdie.
Maybe it' s just my friends she hates.
- I found her.
- Found me?
He saved my life.
He did?
- From a falcon.
- What' s that?
Stuart saved this little bird from a falcon.
A falcon?
They are fierce creatures.
Why does the city have falcons?
That shouldn' t be allowed.
Write a letter.
On the other hand, we have a hero here.
Way to go, Stuart.
- Hey, Dad.
- What?
Silver lining.
It' s a guy thing.
Is it?
Isn' t it nice that Stuart has a friend?
I don' t think Stuart thinks of her as a friend.
- What do you mean?
- I mean he' s smitten.
He' s infatuated.
He' s bedazzled.
But he' s a baby.
Boys start having crushes really young.
Frederick, did you have many crushes?
I' m still having one.
So, Margalo, can I get you anything else?
Whip you up an omelet?
Pop you a tart?
Stuart, I' m full.
Full?
You eat like a bird.
Come on, Stuart, time for school.
I' m not going to school.
I' m staying home to take care of Margalo.
Guess again.
You are going to school, and I' il take care of Margalo.
Look both ways crossing the street...... wear galoshes and, in art class, don' t run with scissors.
I' il get your backpack.
You know.
- Well, I don' t really know.
- No?
See, my mom just kind of one day...... wasn' t there anymore.
So you' ve been completely on your own all your life?
- You bet.
- I' il bet it' s been scary.
No, it' s been an adventure.
I wish I had some adventures.
I' m only allowed to paint.
Hey, life is an adventure.
Just walking out that door is an adventure.
Come on, Stu.
We' re late.
Go for it, kid.
The adventure begins.
That feels like enough adventure for one day.
Hey, look!
The Yankees won.
There we go.
Can you say, "Walk with Mommy"?
"Mommy"?
"Walk"?
Nothing.
Martha and I are going out for a bit.
Can I bring you anything?
No, thanks.
Say, "Bye- bye, birdie."
Say, "Bye- bye." Martha.
Say, "Bye- bye, birdie."
Fresh air.
Remember me?
You scared me.
What can I say?
I' m a scary guy.
So, Margalo, you case the joint?
Come on, thrill me.
Chill me.
They ain' t got much.
The mom' s got a ring, but it' s only two carats.
All right, fine.
What else have they got?
A moment while I vomit.
Why don' t we just try somewhere else?
Because you' re set up here.
They trust you.
They like you.
And maybe...... you like them.
Hey, Margalo, come on.
Don' t con a conman.
Nobody else ever invited me to live with them.
Oh, really?
Who found a pitiful orphan bird...... and plucked her out of the gutter?
Who shared his food with her...... and, I hasten to add, taught her a trade?
Who?
- You did.
Right.
Well, then, straighten up and fly right.
And remember, you are here on business.
You' re not here to play around.
Come on, Falcon!
When I' m on a job, I never play around!
Are you cold?
I guess when the weather gets too cold, you' il just fly south for the winter?
Well, to tell you the truth, I' ve never flown south.
It' s kind of a dream of mine.
Get out of this cold, windy city, catch that jet stream....
Fruit trees, millions of new birds to meet.
- I hear it' s paradise.
- Then how come you haven' t gone?
Something' s always stopping me.
Something' s always stopping me, too.
Everybody around here thinks I' m too small to accomplish anything.
Hey, the way I see it, you' re as big as you feel.
Yeah.
Boy, I' m really glad you fell into my car.
I just....
Want some more popcorn?
Okay.
What?
My pin.
It' s fixed.
How --
On my way home from school, I drive right past where you crashed.
It was no big deal.
I mean, there was finding it...... figuring out how the pieces fit together...... and you know, fixing it.
And no big deal.
Oh, Scottie.... one, two, three.
Good as new.
No, Stuart, it' s not.
It' s much, much better.
- Stay with me.
- All the time.
Did you really think I wouldn' t find out?
What are you talking about?
I' m talking about you and your little mouse friend.
Big mistake!
Never make a friend I can eat.
Now, get me that ring!
Or the mouse is lunch.
- I' il do the dishes.
- You did them last night.
For you, I' d do dishes every night.
That way, I don' t have to change the baby.
She just dropped her dolly.
I' il just --
- Frederick!
- What?
- My ring.
It' s gone.
- What do you mean?
It' s gone!
- Are you absolutely....
- Positive.
Unless....
I' il call the plumber!
What' s going on?
Mom' s ring went down the drain.
I can' t reach it.
Hey!
What about me?
I can do it.
Let me go, Dad.
- Go where?
- Down the drain.
I can bring it back up.
It' s an adventure.
I don' t know.
It' s awfully dark down there.
And smelly.
And cold.
But it' s Mom' s ring.
She loves that ring.
Come on, Dad.
Let me try.
Now, if it gets too cold, or too scary...... you just tell us.
Don' t worry, Dad.
I can handle it.
- Or yank on the string, we' il pull you up.
- Will do.
How' s it so far?
Wet.
There' s a lot of slimy stuff all over the walls.
- What does it look like?
- Like the inside of your nose.
- Can you see the bottom yet?
- No, just more pipe.
And everything we ate for dinner last week.
And the pipe seems to go on and on.
Well, the plumber said....
What' s going on?
Is that a new top?
You know, you have such taste.
Simple elegance is what I call it.
What' s on the other end of that string?
- This string?
- Yes.
Well, now, don' t get excited, but someone that you and I love...... has volunteered to go down the drain to get your ring.
- Stuart?
- Good guess, Mom.
You let our son go down the kitchen drain?
Now, Eleanor, don' t be upset.
It' s been well thought out.
If there' s a problem, I pull on the string and....
Now you can be upset.
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?
Hurry!
I' m slipping.
- Get more string.
- Great.
There must be string here.
- There is no more.
- What else can we use?
- Spaghetti?
- We' re out of spaghetti.
- Well, do we have macaroni?
- That' s too short.
- We can tie it together with -- - No.
Hurry!
Hang on, Stuart!
- Margalo, what are you doing?
- Stuart, I' m coming!
Lower!
Lower!
I got it!
- Are you all right?
- Are you hurt?
Don' t scare me like that.
Margalo, you' re the best friend I ever had.
What if someone had accidentally turned on the garbage disposal?
I would not have let that happen.
- You let him go down the drain.
- He wanted to go.
If Martha wanted to go up the chimney...... or George wanted to go into the toilet, would you let them?
I love Stuart as much as you do.
I just don' t happen to be quite as....
Emotional?
Irrational?
What were you going to say?
I forget.
I know I' m overprotective, it' s just...... I can' t stand the idea of Stuart getting hurt.
I' m sorry, Stuart.
What?
You people sure like your meat loaf.
You find the ring?
Everything but.
Has anyone seen Margalo?
I can' t find her anywhere.
Maybe she just went for a walk or a little flight around the neighborhood.
Sure, to strengthen her wing.
Yeah, maybe.
But why' d she leave me her pin?
Oh, you know, Stuart...... Margalo is kind of a free spirit.
Maybe she just felt it was time to go.
Without even saying goodbye?
What are you doing?
I think I know what happened.
I think that falcon got her.
- Yeah?
- I' m going to find her.
And don' t try to talk me out of it.
I' ve made up my mind.
Are you crazy?
You can' t go out there.
Because I' m too small?
Let me tell you something, you' re as big as you feel.
Then let me come with you.
No, I need you to stay and cover for me.
Cover for you?
How?
Make something up.
You' re smart.
Stuart, she' s just a bird.
No, George, she' s my friend.
And when you' re friends with Stuart Little, you' re friends for life.
Well, ifyou won' t let me come, at least get somebody to go with you.
Snow!
The good silverware' s in the dining room.
Take anything, but don' t hurt me.
It' s me.
Stuart.
This better be important.
Margalo' s still missing.
I should' ve been more specific.
I meant important to me.
I' m going to look for her.
I hoped you' d come.
Look, Stuart, do yourself a favor.
Buy a parakeet and forget her.
I can' t forget her.
She' s in terrible trouble and I have to help her.
I mean what am I, a man or a...... mouse?
Is that a trick question?
It' s important.
You got to help me.
And why would I do that?
Well, because we' re family...... and because I' d do the same for you.
And if you don' t, and the Littles ask where I am, George' il say you ate me.
What?
Why you little rat!
You know something?
You' re not so nice.
Come on!
It' il be fun.
It' s an adventure.
Hey!
Mario Andretti, slow down.
Let' s pace ourselves.
I' il have a heart attack.
I think I' m having a thrombosis and I don' t even know what it means.
George!
Stuart!
Breakfast!
Get it while it' s hot.
Say, "Mama."
Say, "Dada."
Say anything?
'Morning, George.
Where' s Stuart?
He already left.
He did?
Without eating breakfast?
He had to get to school early...... because he' s in a school play.
Really?
Yes.
He plays a mouse.
And they rehearse every morning before school.
Why didn' t he tell us?
He forgot.
You know, being worried about Margalo.
Right.
Good.
This' il keep his mind off it.
Got to go.
Say, "Oatmeal."
Oh, boy.
This is a sign, Stuart.
Like the burning bush.
Except it' s a carburetor and I' m not Moses.
But it' s telling us something.
Let your people go!
- We' re not giving up.
- Oh, why not?
Giving up is fun.
And look at all the time you save.
I' m telling you, if more people gave up, there' d be fewer wars.
Bill.
George.
Hi, Mom.
Where' s Stuart?
He' s not home?
Oh, I just remembered.
He told me to tell you that he' s rehearsing again.
At Will' s house.
And he' s sleeping over there tonight.
Sleepover?
On a school night?
Hey, that' s what he said.
Got to go.
Hello?
Hey, Will.
It' s me, George.
If my mom calls, Stuart' s at your house, okay?
Hold on a second.
Hello?
Will, hi.
It' s Mrs. Little.
May I speak with Stuart, please?
- Stuart?
- You know, my son.
Oh, Stuart.
You mean now?
Well, now is when I' m calling.
Oh, he just went in the bathroom.
I think he' il be a while.
He brought a magazine.
- Well, then, is your mother there?
- Hold on a second.
- I told her.
- Did she buy it?
Yeah, but now she wants to speak to my mom.
What will I tell her?
Make something up.
You' re smart.
If I was smart, I wouldn' t be in this situation.
She can' t come to the phone right now.
She' s in the bathroom, too.
But not the same bathroom!
- Just let her know I called.
Thanks.
- Okay, Mrs. Little.
- It' s all clear.
- I owe you one.
- Now will you tell me what' s going on?
- It' s too complicated.
Later.
- Boys home?
- Well, George is.
But Stuart is rehearsing his play.
Then he' s sleeping over at Will' s house.
- He' s going without George?
- I think it' il give him room to grow.
Oh, Stuart, we' ve been walking for hours.
I can' t take another step.
You know me, I hate to be negative.
But when I walk this much, I chafe.
Also, I hate to bring this up...... but I need to go tinky.
How about the alley?
I' m a house cat.
We' re fastidious creatures.
We don' t just yell, "Bomb' s away!" and go wherever we are!
Oh, look, let' s face it.
We' il never find her.
If only we knew someone who really knew the city.
Yeah, someone who knows the city' s disgusting underbelly.
Who do I know that' s disgusting?
Don' t threaten me!
What I could tell the health inspector...... would close you down in a New York minute!
Monty!
Snowbell!
What are you doing here?
- We' ve been looking all over for you.
- We need your help.
Hey, Snow, are you two still friends or can I eat him?
- No, Monty, you can' t eat him.
- Please.
No!
Now, pay attention.
What do you know about a bird called Falcon?
Falcon?
Oh, that' s a bad guy.
You don' t want to fool with him.
Where would we find him?
You don' t want to find him.
Trust me.
He' d eat you so fast you' d be falcon poop before you could yell for help.
Falcons are vicious.
They grab you by your neck and carry you so high, you can' t even see the ground.
And when you land, they drink what' s left through a straw.
Snowbell, are you all right?
Oh, yeah.
I no longer need a litter box.
Mop up on aisle three.
Stu, listen.
This whole thing has been a groove and a gas...... but it' s important to know when the fun' s over.
You don' t want to be that last pathetic person who leaves a party.
I told you.
I' m not giving up.
We' re going to find the falcon.
It' s your funeral.
Listen carefully.
The falcon lives across the park...... at the very tiptop of the Pishkin Building.
Not many people go up there.
And even fewer return.
Well, here we are, Snowbell.
This is it.
"Salmon, catfish, tuna."
Why do they taunt me?
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Stay on track, will you?
I' m nervous.
When I' m nervous, I eat.
Because I know in my growling gut if anything happens to you, I' il be blamed.
I' m sure they already know we' re gone and plan to replace me with a hamster.
Don' t worry.
George has us covered.
George?
George doesn' t know poop from applesauce.
And I say that with a great deal of affection.
- Hello, Little residence.
- Oh, George.
I' m glad you answered.
Who is it?
Can you speak louder?
George, it' s me, Stuart.
Where are you?
How are you?
Did you find her?
Are you all right?
How' s Snowbell?
When' il you be home?
Mom and Dad are asking lots of questions.
So are you.
I only have a second.
I just want you to know that we' re on the trail...... and with any luck, we' il be home by dinner.
And, George...
-... thanks for covering for me.
- Sure.
But where are you?
Now, listen closely.
We' re at the Pishkin Building.
Please deposit $0. 35 for the next five minutes.
- Snowbell, I need more change.
- What do I look like, a fanny pack?
Are you still there?
Is that Stuart?
Let me think.
Yeah.
I thought he was coming home.
He is.
Later.
He and Will just need to rehearse some more.
In fact, I just left him at Will' s.
Hello, Mrs. Little.
Is George home?
- Will, I found it!
- Found what?
- The calculator.
- The calculator?
Will, where' s Stuart?
It' s okay.
She knows about the play.
It' s supposed to be a surprise.
We' re going back there.
Oh, yeah.
Right.
It' s going to be great.
I just need to get the calculator?
- To figure out how long to rehearse.
- It' s a very complicated play.
- Come on.
Let' s go.
- See you later, Mrs. Little.
George, don' t forget you two have a soccer game later.
We' il meet you there!
I can' t handle this.
All this lying.
I' ve never lied before.
That' s why she believes you.
- Boy, are we in trouble.
- "We"?
Yeah, "we." He didn' t spend the night rehearsing at my house.
What are you planning to do, Mighty Mouse, scale the wall?
I' il think of something.
So long, Snowbell!
You' ve got guts, kid.
Guts and spunk.
Not to mention moxie.
You' ve got guts, spunk and moxie.
Okay.
Here we go.
All right, Falcon.
Hand her over and nobody gets hurt.
You up here?
Is anybody here?
I' m here.
I came for my friend Margalo.
lfyou' ve hurt her, I' il --
- You' il what?
- Tell me right now.
Is she all right?
Why not ask her yourself, Whiskers?
Margalo, run!
Fly away while I' ve got him covered.
What are you waiting for?
This kid' s priceless.
Tell me, Cheese- face, does this sound familiar?
"Oh, my wing.
I don' t think I can fly. "
What are you talking about?
I can' t drill through the wood.
She scammed you.
She played you like a harp.
Margalo, what does he mean?
Okay, now it' s getting sad.
Maybe this will clear things up.
My mom' s ring.
I' m so sorry.
I never wanted to hurt you.
But, Margalo, why?
Don' t be upset, Mouse- boy.
She has conned smarter than you.
Or did you think you were special?
A real friend?
I didn' t lie about that, Stuart.
You are my friend.
Then come with me.
She' s not going anywhere.
Oh, yes, she is.
Was that your best shot?
Now, let me show you mine.
Don' t hurt him, Falcon!
I won' t hurt him.
The sidewalk will!
Can' t we talk this over?
No!
Stuart!
Let me go!
No, Falcon!
A few days in here should provide you with an attitude adjustment.
What have I done?
I' il bet something terrible has happened.
The Littles will kill me.
I know, I' il bring home another mouse in a snazzy outfit...... teach him to drive a sports car and pass him off as Stuart.
Who am I kidding?
I have to get up there.
But how?
I hope I live to regret this.
Yoo- hoo?
Come out, come out wherever you are.
Please don' t jump out from behind anything.
Remember, I have a strong stomach but a very weak heart.
Here, Mousie- Mousie.
Snowbell?
Is that you?
Is that really you?
- Margalo?
Where are you?
- ln the can.
Oh, okay.
I' il wait.
No, in the paint can.
Why are you in there?
Is this some kind of trick?
Just get me out.
Is Stuart in there, too?
No, Snowbell, he' s dead.
What?
Stuart is dead?
Falcon killed him.
No.
He can' t be, he' s....
I was supposed to protect him.
I wish it was me who had been killed.
Really?
No.
But I am very unhappy!
Oh, dear.
I' m dumped on a boat.
I' m on a garbage barge.
I got to get off.
Hello there!
I' m over here!
On the barge!
Can you hear me?
Help!
I' m not supposed to be here!
I need to get off!
Help me!
Help!
Rita, hi.
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I' d get the boys.
- George and Will?
- George and Stuart.
George is here, but I haven' t seen Stuart.
But he slept here last night.
No.
George!
What are you going to do now?
Which way' s Canada?
This is terrible.
I just want to go home.
I know a Little is supposed to always see a silver lining.
Maybe this means I' m not really a Little.
Maybe I' m just Stuart Nobody.
Stuart Nothing.
There is no silver lining!
Oh, no.
What have I done?
My plane.
My plane!
The silver lining!
This is it!
- All right, George, where is he?
- And this time, the truth.
I' m not sure.
It is never okay to lie to your parents.
Is it okay to break a promise to your brother?
It' s wrong to promise your brother you' il lie to your parents.
Listen to the tone of my voice.
Tell us where Stuart is.
It was a promise.
Brother to brother.
George, I understand.
I have a brother.
But if he was in danger, that would matter more to me than the promise.
How would we all feel if anything happened to Stuart?
He' s at the Pishkin Building.
- Dad.
- What?
- Am I in trouble?
- No, son.
You' re in big trouble.
- Mom, Dad, I' m really sorry.
- You should be.
For all we know, Stuart could be out there now, lying face down with his --
Or, he could be fine.
We don' t have to assume the worst.
After all, it' s not the Little way.
Yes, you' re right.
He could be puttering home right now in his shiny little car.
Smiling and happy.
His whiskers fluttering in the breeze.
- Mom.
- Yes, George.
I don' t think he' s puttering home.
Who would do this?
Tiny little vandals.
That miserable falcon!
From this day forward, I vow revenge.
If that falcon were here right now, I' d rip his throat out.
I' d --
That' s him.
Don' t hurt me.
Kill the bird, not me.
I' m going to be falcon poop.
Well, well, well.
The canary is out of her cage.
She' s brought a friend for dinner.
Too bad I don' t like canned food.
Snowbell, get out!
Can' t.
Stuck.
Too fat!
Don' t do it, Falcon.
Or else!
Do what?
What' s he doing?
Or else what?
Or else you' il lose this.
Put that down, Margalo.
I' m through doing what you tell me to do.
I' m leaving you, Falcon, forever.
Oh, and what do you think you' il be without me?
Free.
Big mistake.
I' il be back for you, Fur- ball.
- Stuart!
You' re alive!
- So far!
Where' d you get the plane?
A garbage dump.
Sorry I asked.
- I hope we' re not too late.
- Keep your eyes peeled.
He could be anywhere.
Careful now.
One step at a time.
That' s it.
You' re going to make it.
Yeah!
I' m alive.
I' m alive.
Stuart!
Is that you?
Take me with you!
What about me?
How will I get down from here?
I think this is it.
Turn here.
Okey- dokey.
No problem.
Hey, look!
It' s Stuart.
Stop the car!
Stuart!
Look at that bird.
He' s bigger than me.
We got to save him.
Come on.
It' s the Littles.
I' m saved!
Wait!
It' s me!
Follow that flying mouse.
- No problem.
There he is!
If we get out of this, I' m sticking to painting and dancing.
Hey, lady!
Get out of the way!
He' s closing in.
Oh, my goodness.
Keep it running.
No problem.
He can' t hear you.
I think we lost him.
Going up?
Frederick, I feel so helpless.
A mouse needs to know his limitations.
Stuart!
Pull up!
I can' t!
It' s stuck!
Well, try harder!
Margalo!
Get out!
Save yourself!
No, Stuart!
If we go, we go together!
Stuart!
Pull up!
- Pull up, Stuart!
- Stuart, pull up!
You should' ve stayed in your little hole, Mouse- boy.
Stuart, we can' t outrun him.
Then we' il just have to face him.
It' s too dangerous.
I won' t let you do it.
But I have to try.
I' il be back for you later.
What do you mean?
Stuart!
Don' t do it!
Party' s over, Fur- face.
What' s he doing?
They' il crash!
Stuart!
Turn!
Run away!
Bye- bye, Birdbrain!
Oh, dear.
Got you.
Can' t I get a decent meal in this city?
Thank you.
Stuart!
Are you okay?
I am now.
Margalo saved me.
We saved each other.
What did you think you were doing?
- You almost gave me a heart attack.
- I' m sorry, Mom.
- You ran away from home.
- I know.
And you had George lie to us.
Yeah.
Then why am I so proud of you?
Mrs. Little, this belongs to you.
My ring.
Yeah, I took it.
And now she' s giving it back.
I' m just happy to have all ofyou back.
Snowbell!
You made it.
Thank goodness you' re all right.
Snowbell, where have you been?
You wouldn' t believe what Stuart and Margalo have been through.
You should have seen it.
These two were so brave.
Let' s go home.
And how about me?
I played no part in this?
Well, I have had enough!
I' m staying right here, folks!
Oh, yeah.
You' il never see me again!
Snow, want some tuna when we get home?
Tuna?
I love these people.
Wait!
Wait for me!
I guess they' re flying south for the winter?
I guess.
You' ve always dreamed of going, haven' t you?
But Falcon never let you.
Every year I' d just watch all the other birds go.
The ones who were free.
You' re free.
We' d be so far apart.
It wouldn' t change a thing.
Well....
- You' re sure of the way?
We can call AAA.
- We can get you maps, discount coupons.
There' s a place in South Carolina where they do the best pecan pie.
I' m a bird.
Instinct should take over.
I guess you' ve waited for this a long time.
All my life.
Only....
Only what, dear?
Well, now it' s not just talk.
Now, it' s the real thing.
Are you scared?
The world' s pretty big, and I' m pretty small.
Somebody once told me, "You' re as big as you feel."
Just spread your wings...... and soar.
I' il miss you, Stuart.
I' il miss you, too.
I' il miss all ofyou.
You, too, Snowbell.
I' m not going to cry.
Stuart?
Yeah, Dad?
What' s the silver lining this time?
She' il be back in the spring.
Bye- bye, birdie.
- Did you hear that?
- Her first words!
She spoke!
- Of course she did.
- I knew she could do it.
Big deal.
When she can fall from a tree and land on her feet, then I' il be impressed.
How did he know about the money?
We didn' t find out about it till this morning.
- I don' t know.
- It was Peezee.
Gotta be.
He hates your fucking guts.
- I don' t know.
- What is so hard to understand here?
Now all of a sudden you got a soft spot for this guy.
- I just don' t think it was him.
- Okay, I' il buy it.
If not Peezee, then who?
Who?
Tell me.
I think it was you, Ducks.
Caesar?
Caesar, you know me.
What kind of fucking idiot would I have to be to try that with you?
- Come on, Caesar.
Caesar.
Caesar!
- This is garbage.
Change the channel.
- Okay, Paul.
What are you doing, asshole?
Didn' t mean any disrespect.
- Punks.
Let them watch what they want.
I' m going to bed.
- Good night, Paul.
- All right, what do youse wanna watch?
- Hey, Earl, what' s up?
- They' re transferring me.
- Not me.
- What' s up?
- I don' t know.
Anyway, thanks for looking out for me, Paul.
- I' il see you around.
- Sure.
Isaac Sobel was a man of rigorous belief and unflinching honesty.
A patriarch with an almost biblical sense of integrity and conviction.
A good friend who will be deeply missed.
I' d like to call on Isaac' s son, Dr. Ben Sobel, who would like to say a few words.
It' s not easy for me to talk about my father...... because, in a sense, I' m talking about two people.
One is the public Isaac Sobel...... the eminent psychotherapist...... and popular author known to millions of readers across the world.
My father.
Dad.
And for those of you who knew him well...... and know our family, well, I don' t have to tell you.
An arrogant, ego- inflated son of a bitch.
I wish you were alive so I could kill you.
Rot in hell!
Now I' d like to call on Isaac' s son, Dr. Ben Sobel...... who would like to say a few words.
Who the hell would have a cell phone in here?
It' s yours.
Answer it before they notice.
- Guess who, you fuck?
I' m sorry.
- Yes?
- I left three fucking messages.
- You don' t call me back?
Not a good time?
Let me explain something, I' m in fucking hell right now.
- This is not a good time.
- This is a very bad time.
My father died.
- I have to go.
- Don' t you hang up on me, you...
- They' re trying to kill me.
Hey, Fredo.
Yeah, you, Guido.
Come over here.
I' ve got something to show you.
You' re a dead man.
385, mess hall.
- Thank you.
I can' t believe he' s gone.
I can' t believe what you said.
"Cold and withholding"?
- You had to tell everybody?
I might have strayed from my notes a little bit.
It' s a big loss, and grief is a process.
Mr. And Mrs. Sobel, your housekeeper let us in.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
- We' d like to ask you a few questions.
- Can I ask what this is about?
We' ve just come from a funeral.
We know this is a difficult time for you.
It will only take a minute.
Sure, sit down.
- Sorry about your father.
- Thank you very much.
I' m gonna miss him terribly.
I mean, there were issues, like there are in any father- and- son relationship.
- Ben.
- Yeah?
Once today.
Enough.
Okay.
Man.
Dr. Sobel, you received a call this morning from Paul Vitti.
Why would you say that I got a call from Paul Vitti?
Because we monitor all his phone calls from Sing Sing.
Then, yes, I did.
- That was him?
- Yes.
- Why didn' t you tell me?
- Michael.
- You told her at the drop of a hat.
Well, she' s in the FBl.
She needs to know this information.
I don' t need to know these things.
No, don' t tell Laura.
Did I say that?
Did I say that?
- You folks need a minute?
- No, we' re fine.
Listen, I' m gonna go to the kitchen.
Just two words of advice, as one professional woman to another:
Pants suit.
You know, it' s a process.
Vitti?
We were involved in some organized- crime activity a few years ago.
He was involved.
But I was treating him therapeutically at the time...... and then some people tried to kill us.
It was really nothing.
Really?
What kind of breakdown?
I think you had better go up there and see for yourself.
Seems to keep him pretty calm.
That would keep the Middle East pretty calm.
And he just keeps singing West Side Story songs?
"Tonight." "Maria." The balcony scene.
It' s really good.
- Paul?
- Maria?
Paul, it' s me.
Dr. Sobel.
Maria?
Tony?
Maria!
- Oh, my God!
Thank God you' ve come!
- Okay.
- Do you promise?
- I promise.
- Te adoro.
- Te adoro.
This is how it' s been.
He sings for a while, then he goes completely catatonic.
And you did a neurological workup?
Yeah.
No tumors, no seizures, no sign of stroke.
Paul?
If you' re faking, Paul, I' m gonna know.
When I was a resident, we used to play with the catatonics.
Well, I don' t think he' s faking.
I don' t think he' s smart enough.
Street smart, yeah...... but we' re talking about an IQ just north of a bedroom slipper.
So if he is truly...... catatonic, if I stuck him with this needle...
- This is just plain saline, isn' t it?
- Yeah.
Then he shouldn' t feel a thing.
Right?
That' s gotta hurt.
No reaction at all.
I want to do some neuropsychological testing, okay?
Sure.
Paul, I' m gonna give you some tests to assess your mental condition, okay?
Now, do I have your consent to share the results of the tests?
Mommy is mad at me because I made a boom on the rug.
- I' m gonna take that as a yes.
Okay.
Paul, I have 10 cards, each with a picture of an inkblot on it, okay?
Here' s the first card.
Now look at it, and tell me what you see.
I see a bat.
A bat or a weasel.
- Yeah.
Bat- weasel.
Do you see anything else?
Just a pussy with teeth.
- Pussy with teeth.
- Yeah.
Next card.
Excellent, Paul.
One hour and 12 minutes.
I want you to take a look at this picture and tell me what' s happening.
I think we got a picture of a guy, nice, hardworking fella.
Comes home, sees his wife is in bed with a midget...... and she' s been fucking him while he' s out of town.
With a midget.
Very good.
Tell them they got no leverage.
- Mr. Chapin?
- Come in.
Come in.
- Hi, I' m Dr. Ben Sobel.
- Hi.
Thanks for coming in.
I appreciate it.
- My pleasure.
- So, what have we got?
Okay...
Based on his symptoms and his test results, I would call it brief psychotic disorder...... and if it persists, schizophreniform disorder.
And Dr. Kassam, the psychiatrist at Sing Sing, concurs with the diagnosis.
- Not crazy.
At least not permanently.
See, in certain people, prolonged exposure to extremely stressful situations...... like soldiers in combat, for instance, or disaster victims or hostages...... can produce a temporary psychotic state.
- How temporary?
- A day, a week, a month...... if the precipitating stresses are removed.
Which means he' s not gonna get better as long as he' s in the can.
He could conceivably get worse.
Right now he thinks somebody is trying to kill him.
And he could deteriorate to the point where he' s permanently schizophrenic.
He goes before the parole board in four weeks.
Oh, yeah.
I' m sure they' il want to release a major Mafia figure...... who' s now certifiably deranged on top of it.
Why don' t they release him to a halfway house...... or a center where he can get the care he needs?
Based on my earlier work with him, I don' t think he' s dangerous...... and I think he' s making a strong effort to reform himself.
Okay...... I' il tell you what I' m gonna do.
I' m gonna release him into your custody.
Mine?
Oh, no.
No.
Mr. Chapin, thank you, anyway, but this is a very bad time for me.
And I' m grieving.
It' s a process.
And I have this burning sensation when I urinate...
- Yeah, I' ve had that too.
- We' re redecorating, which is a nightmare.
- You wanna see him killed in prison?
- No.
Or sent to a facility for the criminally insane?
- Of course not.
- Then he' s all yours.
I told my son we couldn' t have a dog.
I' m gonna bring home Paul Vitti?
I' m gonna talk to the Bureau of Prisons...... and get you certified as a temporary federal institution.
I handle neurotic soccer moms and alcoholic Gentiles...
Now I' m warning you, doctor.
If he screws up in any way, if he flees...... or if I find out this was a setup to get him on the street...... I will hold you totally responsible.
And you will pay dearly.
You' il be stripped of your license and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Are we clear?
Yes.
Do you want him or not?
- Yes.
- Good choice.
We' il be in touch.
- Hi, how are you?
You okay?
- Okay.
Okay, thank you very much.
You fucking piece of shit!
- I knew it.
I knew it!
You faked!
- You stuck me with a fucking needle!
- You used me to get you out of prison.
- It took you long enough.
I' m half a fag already.
- What were you doing?
- I was in a funeral home!
What' s that got to do with somebody trying to kill me?
You' re my doctor!
- My father died.
- So?
With you, it' s always, "Me, me, me."
He' s dead, so get over it.
That' s life.
Are you hearing this?
Are you hearing you?
- I' m deeply sorry for your loss, okay?
- Yeah, I can see how touched you are.
- All right.
Who' s after you?
- You tell me.
Could be my old crew, could be the Rigazzis, Lou the Wrench.
Lou the Wrench?
Why "the Wrench"?
He twisted some guy' s head off once.
- Off?
- Off.
Totally off.
It' s like the fall of the Roman Empire.
- They knew I was getting out.
The last thing they want to do is see me get into it.
Just explain to them that you' re out of it now and you' re starting a new life.
That' s a really imaginative thought.
I wish I could have thought of that.
What, are you kidding me?
Believe me, nobody' s happy that I' m getting out.
Nobody.
- Wanna grab your stuff?
Jelly' s gonna pick me up in an hour.
I don' t think you understand.
You stay here.
Therapy every day.
You can' t leave without permission.
You gotta be kidding me.
Are you coming in, or do I have to make a phone call?
Some fucking life this is gonna be.
Do you really think he' s crazy?
Don' t you wanna get a second opinion?
If he thinks I think he' s crazy, he' s crazier than I think he is.
Locked up, he' s of absolutely no use to us.
But back on the street, Vitti has enough juice to be a threat to both families.
It' s like throwing gasoline on a fire.
- That' s if he goes back to his old life.
- People like Paul Vitti don' t change.
- Being a criminal is all he knows.
- He' s gonna head straight back for trouble.
We need to stay on Vitti.
How could you?
How could you bring him here?
That mobster in my house, eating off of my dishes.
It' s not like I had a lot of choice.
You have to bring home a gangster?
He' s in my custody.
I am a temporary federal institution.
- Why couldn' t he just go home?
- Because his wife and his family are in Ohio.
Sure, yeah, everybody gets to go to Ohio except me.
- You wanna go to Ohio?
Shut up!
He didn' t want to endanger his family.
How thoughtful.
But it' s okay to endanger our family?
I know this is a terrible imposition, but it' s not like I wanted him here.
Well, you didn' t want him, and I didn' t want him, but here he is.
- Coffee?
- What?
Somebody said something about coffee.
Yeah, that was you.
You said you wanted some.
So, what' s the holdup?
Ben, why don' t you make your friend some coffee.
And hopefully drown.
It' s a process.
Hey, doc, listen.
I got a friend coming over, so I don' t want you to be surprised.
What kind of friend?
Because if it' s the Wrench, or the Pliers...
- Oh, yeah?
They won' t be staying late, will they?
- Are you that fucking pussy- whipped?
- I' m not...
- This has nothing to do with Laura.
- I just heard her busting your balls.
- Or?
- Or what?
- You' re pussy- whipped.
- Paul, I am not...
When the coffee' s ready, I' il be upstairs.
Good night, whippy.
Forty minutes.
- How long are you gonna let them go on?
- Let them?
How much longer can they go on?
Another five minutes, I' il break it up or I' il call the Guinness Book of Records.
Oh, God.
Give me a break.
She' s faking.
What?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
Come on, nobody sounds like that.
- "I don' t know."
Yeah?
- Paul, I have to talk to you.
- I have to talk to you.
- Talk later?
Now.
Hold on.
- Yeah?
- I have a 17- year- old son.
I' il ask her.
That' s not what I' m talking about.
I need to speak to you.
Can' t you see?
Paul, now.
And, miss, there' s no smoking in my house.
Thank you.
Okay, Paul, what do you think you' re doing?
Minding my own business, like you should be doing.
That' s difficult to do with The VaGina MonoloGues in the guest room.
- What am I supposed to do?
- Go to a hotel.
You told me I can' t.
You said it' s either here or Sing Sing.
I' m not trying to punish you, but I do have some responsibilities.
I thought you might appreciate a nice home- cooked meal after being in prison.
Yeah, that' s what I' ve been jerking off to for the last 850 nights in a row.
A fucking home- cooked meal.
- All right, Paul?
- The girl?
You know, I bet you' re jealous.
Yes, I' m very...
And what might I be jealous of?
I didn' t hear nothing out of your room.
We don' t think it' s necessary to wake the neighbors every time we have sex.
If you' re quiet, you could do it without even waking your wife.
What is that?
I told her if I wasn' t back in two minutes to start without me.
I gotta go.
- This is not a good start.
- It was for me till you knocked on my door.
- Here, Aunt Esther.
- Thank you.
And again, I' m so sorry we had to put you up at a hotel.
We would' ve loved to have you stay with us, but we had an unexpected houseguest.
- Shut up.
You go to hell!
I am so out of here!
Go on, get out of here, you fucking pain in the ass!
You crazy pain in the ass!
Get the fuck out of here!
Go ahead, go back to turning tricks in Hoboken, you pain in the ass!
How' s it going?
Food.
Paul?
- Hey, doc.
I' m just looking for something to eat over here.
This all you got?
Who do you have to fuck to get some bacon around here?
Not you, I hope.
He' s new in town.
Let' s go in the office, I' il make you a plate.
- What' s in the office?
- We' re gonna go to the office and talk first.
Hey, doc, what' s up with your family?
I know.
All you did was flash everybody in the dining room.
- It' s good for them.
- Good for them?
Well, when the paramedics revive my aunt Golda, I' il be sure to ask her, okay?
Sit down.
So...
Paul, do you mind?
I think we' ve seen enough of the old salsicc 'for one day.
Thank you.
So, what are you gonna do, Paul?
I' m a target.
Then what?
- So I gotta deal with that.
I' m talking about a job, work.
There' s gotta be something that you like to do.
That' s good.
So sporting goods.
- Yeah, exactly.
- That' s interesting.
- Who am I?
- I just wanna know how you see yourself.
I' m Paul Vitti.
I' m the boss.
The boss of Jelly?
Because you' re not the boss of me.
So, what are you the boss of?
I see what you' re doing, you.
I see.
I get it.
- What am I doing?
Look at me.
I' m starting to get anxious.
It' s very understandable that you' re anxious.
I mean, you spent your whole life becoming something that you were...... and now you can' t be that anymore, so it' s scary.
I mean, if you' re not Paul Vitti "the boss," who are you?
Let me ask you this way.
When you were a kid, what did you want to be?
Who remembers that shit?
- Did you want to be a baseball player?
- No.
A fireman?
An astronaut.
Come on, what did you wanna be?
- It was stupid.
- It' s not stupid.
- What, are you afraid to tell me?
So tell me.
I' m not here to judge you.
What did you want to be?
There was one time when I was about...... maybe 6, 6 and a half, 7.
For a second...
- Maybe...
What?
- Tell me.
- A cowboy, really?
- Would you believe that?
Well, that' s interesting.
How did that start?
You know, we watched those cowboy shows.
My father got me the whole outfit.
He got me a 10- gallon white hat...... the boots, the spurs, the cap guns...... the whole bit.
Then he took me upstate to my uncle' s farm and led me around on this little pony.
It was like, to me, the Wild West.
And it was all "yippee kai- ay" and all that stuff.
You happy now?
- I don' t know.
What happened?
- Why didn' t you try to be a cowboy?
I joined a street gang when I was 12 years old.
"Why didn' t I become a cowboy?"
Something else happened when you were 12 that was very difficult for you.
Yeah.
That' s when your father was murdered.
- It has a lot to do with things.
It' s very interesting because your father was the one who got you the white hat.
He was in the Mob, but yet he wanted you to be a hero.
Yeah, he did.
Your father wanted you to have a better life than he did.
He did, yeah.
He wanted me to go to college.
I didn' t even go to high school, hardly.
That' s because he had died and he wasn' t around to guide you.
See, Paul, before, you said, "I' m Paul Vitti, the boss"...... but when I look at you, I see Paul Vitti the 12- year- old kid...... who' s scared and confused with a lot of hard choices to make.
- You.
You' re good, you.
- No, Paul...
- No, you' re good.
You' re better than good.
- It' s just the beginning.
You' re real good.
You made me realize I' m a little fucking kid.
That' s great.
- It' s clear now.
I' m ready.
There' s somebody that I work with.
He' s a career counselor.
- He places people in jobs.
- I' m ready.
- I' m ready to jump in with both feet.
- I' m ready!
- Down!
That was not a good thing.
Hi, doc.
- Hey, doc.
It' s been a while.
- I thought you were in prison.
- It would appear not.
- Well, how did you get out?
- I had a new trial.
It turns out the evidence in my first trial was, you know, tainted.
I see.
Anyway, two of the witnesses decided not to testify, and the third guy...... he committed suicide.
How?
He stabbed himself in the back four times and threw himself off a bridge.
Very unfortunate.
Good to have you back.
We' re in a war, Paul.
It' s not safe out there.
The Rigazzis are walking all over us.
We need you, Paul.
You know, Sally, I' m out of it.
I don' t do this no more.
What are you talking about?
No one did the big jobs like you.
Air France, they' re still talking about it.
Paul, think about it.
For me?
- Okay.
Come on, what is this?
A fucking funeral?
You just got out of college, for chrissakes.
Let' s have a party.
I' il have one drink, and then I gotta go see the boss.
- "Yeah, what?"
That' s how you answer the door, you?
You got a problem with that?
- Yeah, what?
- Don' t bother getting up on our account.
Paul, what a nice surprise.
- Yeah, Patti, how' s it going?
- It' s good.
Give me a kiss.
Get over here.
Come on, what did I do?
What did I do that you' re mad at me?
Come on.
- How are you, Paul?
- All right.
- You can' t be too careful.
Hey, I know.
Sorry to hear about Carmine.
- He was a good man.
- Yeah, I know.
- It' s hard.
- Yeah, I' il bet.
Especially since the talk was that you were the one that put him there.
- That' s why I try not to gossip.
It' s ugly.
Just a sec.
Michelle, Theresa, it' s 10: 30.
Stop fucking around and get ready for ballet!
It' s so hard being a single parent and a career woman.
For instance, a lot of people are saying now that you' re out...... that you' re gonna try and take the family from me.
I said, "No, Paul would never do that to me."
- Never.
- Good.
So you look good.
What, have you been working out?
Got any ideas?
And you know nobody will be safe unless we end this thing with the Rigazzis.
- So you had nothing to do with it?
- Paul, calm down, okay?
I did not try and kill you.
All right?
Look, I want us to be friends, you know?
Who knows?
Maybe we' il be more than friends.
You wanna lick my beaters?
Patti, let' s get serious.
I wanna be left alone, okay?
- Sure, I understand, okay?
- You understand?
I do.
Relax.
Sit down, I' il make you a cup of coffee.
I got a business thing with some guy.
A little taste.
It' s different.
- You gave me a chill.
Yeah, well, you' il get over it.
Give me a kiss.
Come on, give me a kiss, you.
- Take care of yourself, huh?
All right.
- Don' t be a stranger, Paul.
- Yeah, I' il see you around.
Watch him like a hawk.
It would break my heart, but if he steps out of line, shoot him in the fucking head.
It' il be my pleasure.
You could put three bodies in there.
- Okay, thank you.
We appreciate it.
- Hey, what kind of car youse drive, anyway?
- It' s a Lexus 430 LS.
- It' s a Lexus.
- Yeah, Toyota, Lexus, same thing.
Japanese, right?
Anyway, let' s get serious.
You wanna buy this car, or what?
- What' s to think about?
You told me you liked it.
You drove it.
You know, it' s a lot of money, and we need time to consider it.
Consider it?
Why don' t you consider this.
You been breaking my balls for an hour...... asking me about every goddamn accessory in this car.
- "What about the light?"
- You cannot talk to customers like that.
You' re not a customer as far as I' m concerned.
- You want to buy the car or not?
- Not from you.
I wanna see the manager.
You wanna see the manager?
I' il show you the manager.
- Here' s the manager.
Right here.
- Unbelievable.
- Come on.
- Wanna talk to him?
What should I do?
Throw them out!
You hear him?
He just said, "Throw them out."
What should they get?
Tell them to get a Honda!
He' s the boss.
Good.
Good.
That' s great, Paul.
That' s great.
Did you sell any cars?
Almost.
6: 45, okay.
- Paul, thanks for everything.
- We have been waiting here 20 minutes.
Now get out of here.
- Mr. Torre.
- Hey, Paul.
Glad you' re out.
- How are you?
My son Michael.
- Hey, Michael, nice to meet you.
- I wanted to ask you something.
- Yeah?
You think the Yankees are gonna go all the way?
- We' il do our best.
- It would be very important to me personally.
Very important.
- Try.
- Go eat.
- Joe, good to see you.
- Welcome back.
- Thank you, Charlie.
Hey, Paul.
- Hey, Joey.
- How are you?
I heard you was out.
- Yeah, well, you know...
When Mr. Arnold comes in bring him right back.
You working here?
I got a piece of the joint.
We' re gonna have a drink at the bar.
- All right, okay.
- Nice to meet you.
Thanks, Paul.
Appreciate it.
Thanks.
- You want more bread?
Bread.
There you go.
I' il get your drinks now.
It looks a little yellow, doesn' t it?
It makes everything look yellow.
What am I, Edison?
That' s a G.
Well, maybe.
Look from that angle.
What do you think?
I don' t know.
Could we look at it with a lens?
That might help us out.
Do you have a lens?
We just asked for a lens.
- Where do you think you' re going?
- Where am I going?
The orphanage found my real parents.
I' m going to Jelly' s house.
No, you' re not.
You' re in my custody.
For what?
The more we talk, the worse I get.
- I had that dream again.
- The one where you' re Mussolini?
No, the other one.
And I' m fighting them off.
Too bad.
- The limp- sword dream?
- Yeah.
- I probably shouldn' t be listening to this.
- Well, then don' t.
Paul?
Sorry.
Let' s talk about it.
And you don' t think this dream is sexual?
That ain' t it.
- I don' t need to know that.
- You could hang wet towels on this one.
Congratulations.
It' s a nice thing to have.
- He' s built like a racehorse in that area.
- Thank you.
I get it.
- I' ve seen it.
- So, what does it mean?
- Sex can mean a lot of things.
You' re under a lot of pressure.
You' re changing your life, you' re trying to find a job that fits you.
This 9 to 5 bullshit?
I' il fucking kill myself.
Like, I' m doomed.
I' il wind up selling hot dogs on the street.
Take a deep breath, Paul.
- Just relax.
Here, breathe into this bag.
And breathe in and then breathe out.
In, out.
- Excuse me?
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?
Really?
Is it?
You know what, I' m doing the best that I can.
All right?
Because I didn' t ask to be born!
I' m sorry.
It' s a process.
All right, I' m the patient.
That' s enough.
Now what are you taking?
There' s a lot of plants and ticks.
Okay.
Yeah, I know it.
The producer of the show is a man named Raoul Berman.
A mutual friend told him I know you, so Mr. Berman called me this morning...... and said that he would like to meet you.
I don' t know.
Why don' t you meet him and find out?
Now we' re having dinner with him?
- That' s not very professional, is it?
- It' s social.
He' s very nervous about it, and he asked me to buffer.
I' m here to buffer.
Why does he need a chaperone?
He doesn' t.
He needs a buffer.
That' s me.
I' m here in a buffering capacity.
If you say "buffer" one more time...
We' il be back before they finish dinner.
Did I?
No, that was the other...
This is different.
Just don' t drink anything.
Drink?
Honey, I' m a doctor, I know what I' m doing.
I adore this place.
Yeah, it smells good.
Did you try the yellowtail, Paul?
They got any real food around here?
I mean, this is like eating fucking bait.
Raoul, what' s very interesting about Paul is that he was born without a filter.
He never edits himself.
- What' s with you?
- What do you mean?
- You sound like a fucking retard.
I took an ibuprofen pill.
I probably shouldn' t have had the mai tai or the sake.
That' s all.
- It will be gone in about an hour.
See that?
He just told me to shut the fuck up!
I love it!
I absolutely love it.
In two seconds, I' m gonna stick this fork in your fucking eye.
He will stick a fucking fork in my eye!
What did I tell you?
Unfiltered.
Could I get another one of these, please?
- No.
No.
- Why not?
- The buffer has had too much.
Mr. Berman, I love your show.
Thank you.
He grew up in Bensonhurst, right next door to my cousin' s friend' s husband.
I hate to bust your bubble, but there' s no way he' s from Bensonhurst.
He' s, like, a professional Italian from Connecticut or someplace.
Listen, Paul, I have to ask, would you be interested in working on Little Caesar...... as a consultant and technical advisor, you know, coaching the actors?
Making sure the dialogue rings true.
- Oh, my God!
This is so exciting!
Fantastic!
How about a toast?
A toast to Paul and Little Caesar.
Down!
That restaurant was really good.
Now, is that the right terminology, Mafia shrink?
Sorry.
Do you know that you were muttering and drooling like one of your relatives tonight?
What are you taking?
You know, at this point, anything I can get my hands on.
Okay?
Because I am staring into a big hole that I can' t fill up.
You don' t need this.
You don' t need this Paul Vitti thing in your life right now.
Especially not right now.
I think you need to be grieving for your father.
You know, it' s just, I' m finding the whole thing just a little confusing.
I mean, it was that easy.
Because his approval was so important to me.
I mean, it was everything.
And I never really got it.
Is this the reason I did it?
And now that he' s gone, do I still wanna do this?
Because I don' t know.
Come here, baby.
I just want you to be happy.
Hey, pal.
- I' il ask you once.
Who are you working for?
- I' m working for your mother.
- Fuck me?
Yeah.
No, no, no, wait, wait!
Wait!
- Who are you working for?
Get me up!
Get me up!
Drop him.
I' m working for Lou the Wrench.
- The Wrench?
- Yeah, the Wrench.
- How do you spell his name?
- I don' t know how to spell it.
R- I- Z- A- Z- Z...
Can' t even spell his fucking name right, you fucking moron.
Pull him up.
You said drop him.
- I said pull him back up.
- That ain' t what I heard.
Then you heard what you wanted to hear.
I guess you got me there.
What the hell happened to you?
Vitti?
You talked to Vitti?
Yeah, I talked to Vitti.
- What did you say to him?
- Nothing.
- You sure you didn' t tell him anything?
- I didn' t say anything, Mr. Rigazzi.
Can I go now?
I think my leg' s broken.
That must hurt, huh?
Wait a minute.
I have something for that.
I hate to see people in pain.
Get him out of here.
What about Vitti?
He' s a hard man to kill.
But he' s not immortal.
- Okay, roll film.
Hey, I like my sausage burnt.
I don' t know how you like your sausage?
I been doing this 20 fucking years.
- You got the money?
- I almost got it.
I' m still light 15 large.
All I gotta...
All I gotta...
Cut!
Cut!
Can you do something about the goddamn smoke?
Cut!
Can you do something about the damn smoke?
This is the trouble with shooting on location...... although it' s worth it for the authenticity.
Well, it looks authentic.
Hey, Tony!
Tony.
Anthony Bella, Nicky Caesar.
- This is Paul Vitti.
- You don' t have to tell me who he is.
- It' s a pleasure to meet you, mate.
- Hey, mate.
I don' t believe this.
An English guy.
- You ain' t even Italian.
- There' s a lot of paisans down under.
- Down under what?
- You like to laugh, don' t you?
So I' il just...
So, Paul, are you gonna join us?
I' m thinking I might.
I like the whole setup here.
Sensational, mate.
I got a lot of questions for you.
- All right.
- Can we get this fucking shot?
- Yes, yes.
Paul, thank you.
And welcome.
Welcome aboard.
Couple of things.
I don' t know who makes these decisions...... but there are things that I see that don' t look right.
Yes, I sensed this myself.
Which elements strike you as wrong?
I mean, you got a boss who speaks Australian.
- What the fuck is that about?
- Not my first choice.
- And your background is what?
That figures.
I got some people I could bring around...... that will add a certain authenticity to the whole thing.
I would be eternally grateful to you if you could.
Is there anything else that you would need?
Done!
Done!
I am gonna go put that in the works right now.
Right.
- Hey, Paul.
- Yeah, I' m really gonna do this.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I' m going nuts already with this job thing.
In a week, I' il fucking kill this Raoul or I' il kill myself.
This is just a good cover till I figure out what I' m gonna do.
But call the guys.
- You know, there' s a line here.
- Yeah, it' s in back of me.
Take the chicken and the two pastas.
Youse don' t stop eating.
- No, no good.
- It' s not good?
What about this line?
- No.
Never.
- It' s not good?
Never.
"How much does the chosen snitch want for this?"
- No?
- No.
- No good.
Jesus.
That' s the end of the scene.
- You' re better off.
Get in the car.
- We going to the prom?
- Shut up and get in the car.
I know.
Careful.
The eggs are on the bottom.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
You the shrink taking care of Paul Vitti?
- Yes, I am.
- So is he nuts, or what?
Discuss it.
He' s suffering from a chronic anxiety, and...
Sociopathy.
I' m getting a fucking headache here.
What are you trying to say?
He has a criminal temperament.
He' s a criminal?
This is news?
And for that you need a doctor degree?
What do you do for him?
I try to get him to see the possibility of change.
Wrong.
You do not want him to change.
That' s Mrs. LoPresti.
Patti.
Patti, I' m Ben Sobel.
Paul Vitti is very important to this family.
Stromboni?
The thing they clean the ice with at the hockey games?
That' s a Zamboni, asshole.
Stromboni.
It' s a bull with his balls cut off.
- No, we don' t want to see that happen.
- Not unless you want to be one too.
No, I' m very attached to my balls.
As you can probably tell.
Then do the right thing.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
Goodbye.
No hard feelings.
No, and probably never again.
We' re gonna need a grapple or a crane.
I seen one in Bayonne, but I' il call around.
All right, see what you can do.
And we' re gonna need a city bus.
Anybody got ideas about that?
- Let me know when you want me to call.
- Hello, Paul.
- Good.
I guess everyone' s gone Hollywood.
Yeah?
So am I. Let' s walk.
Come on.
- I heard you had some more trouble.
- Yeah, Lou the Wrench took a shot at me.
That' s what the family is all about.
Since the old days when the grandfathers first came over.
It' s not something you walk away from.
When you' re a Jet, you' re a Jet all the way.
- What?
- Nothing.
So you wanna tell me what' s going on?
I see you have your whole crew back together.
They' re actors now.
Don' t bullshit me, Paul.
All right.
All right, I' il tell you.
Something' s going down.
It' il be fine.
You' re a good friend.
I would never insist on something like this...... but I' d feel better if you' d bring Eddie and a couple of my guys in...... you know, to help you with the job.
Eddie "Yeah, what?"
- He' s a good man.
He' s young.
What is this, crime school?
This is a serious thing we' re doing here.
Check him out.
Talk to Jackie the Jew.
They' il vouch for him.
For me.
He does what I tell him, stays out of the way, and he keeps his fucking mouth shut.
Fine.
Thanks, Paul.
I really appreciate this.
Oh, God.
Dear God.
Look, sweetheart...
And the hair, please, what is it?
Something from the cliche store?
Raoul.
This is a friend of mine.
Patti.
This is Raoul.
Patti Lo...?
Patti LoPresti?
I am so very, very sorry.
How dare you not inform me that Mrs. LoPresti is on the set today!
You are fired!
Please, enjoy your visit with us.
And if there is anything at all that I can do...
Go fuck yourself.
Immediately.
He' s from the theater.
- Should I wait here, Mr. Rigazzi?
- No, pull the car up your ass and wait there.
Was she angry?
Am I in danger?
Don' t worry about it.
I just wouldn' t start my car for a couple of weeks if I were you.
He' s new.
Hey, Paul.
Hey, Lou.
The Wrench?
Brian?
Sorry.
Now!
Come on, I wanna talk to you.
- I never gave the order.
- Yeah?
He' s been taken care of.
There won' t be another incident.
Me?
No.
Good.
Then I got no beef with you.
Good, I can sleep better.
You wanna back a winner, which is gonna be me, okay?
It only makes sense.
I' il treat you right.
No, thanks.
So much for sleeping better.
You be careful.
Listen, Jelly, you just pick numbers.
- Jelly.
- Hey, doc!
How are you?
How are you, Yo- Yo?
Mo- Mo.
I was thinking of the cellist.
Jelly, where' s Paul?
He' s in his camper.
Yeah.
Doc, what are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?
I came to tell you that you had a meeting with your parole officer, and who do I see?
Patti who?
Stop lying to me.
Your whole gang is here.
Who says I' m lying?
That' s how much you trust me?
Paul, it' s not that I don' t trust you.
It' s just that I don' t trust you.
You make one mistake and nobody lets you forget it.
So now you' re the victim?
Paul, I want the truth.
Wait a second.
- Say that again.
- Say what?
- I want the truth.
- No, strong, like before.
- Paul, I want the truth!
That' s it.
- What?
- I' m serious, that had power.
You could be an actor.
- Paul, I am not an actor.
- There' s this part you could do.
- I can' t.
We have this meeting.
I' m telling you, it' s you.
People thought I was quite good.
Help!
Hey, help me!
I don' t wanna do this!
- Does that screaming sound real to you?
- Yeah, that sounds pretty real to me.
That was not funny at all.
There was no harness.
They could' ve dropped me.
If you didn' t wanna do it, you should' ve said.
I didn' t know they would throw me off.
They hung you over the side.
That' s it.
I know what you' re doing.
You' re upset that I have custody of you...... so you passive- aggressively make me look like a fool.
Come on.
You were great.
You were great.
So I...
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.
Okay.
- What are you doing, self- medicating again?
Don' t give me that decongestant, multivitamin shit.
- Come on, what are you doing?
Helps my memory...... and I forget what else.
But don' t worry about me.
Worry about what you' re gonna say to this parole officer.
I mean, what are you gonna tell him?
And for what?
A high- school dropout reunion?
- You recognize that car?
- Which car?
That?
Oh, yeah.
That is one sweet machine.
- Lose them.
- What?
- Lose them.
- Lose them!
- Lose that car?
You can' t...
I' m gonna stop, Paul.
This could be the FBl.
Left.
It' s daylight.
Right!
This is a lease.
Hey, it' s a goddamn lease!
I' il drive.
- Move over where?
Back seat!
- Damn seat belt.
Get over!
- It' s gonna get worse?
It ain' t gonna get better.
Stop it!
Oh, my God.
You think they' il get out?
- I feel bad.
Where are you going?
- I gotta take care of this.
- Paul, your parole officer...
- Send him my regards.
If you leave now...
That' s it.
You' re on your own now, pal.
That' s it.
I' m done.
I' m...... screwed.
So where is he, doctor?
I wish I knew.
Considering I released him into your custody, that' s not quite the answer I was looking for.
Care to tell me what you know?
I don' t know anything.
- Yes.
That' s why we got two corpses in the bottom of the river?
Here.
Vitti with Eddie DeVol.
I can order you some wallet- size.
I am giving you 24 hours to find him and deliver him to me.
Otherwise, you' re looking at obstruction of justice and accessory to manslaughter.
- Sure, but you can' t take your car.
We' re impounding it as evidence.
- Can I get a ride?
- Have a nice day.
I don' t got a lot of time.
They' re probably gonna come looking for me, so we' il go over everything at the club.
Paul, not that I' m questioning or anything, but what do we need with this Eddie DeVol?
The guy is like a petty larceny scumbag.
Hey, I ain' t happy about it either.
- Yeah?
- Mr. Vitti?
- Can' t.
Gotta go.
- It' s important.
- I' il talk to him tomorrow.
Here, here.
Tell him you never saw me, okay?
- Paul, excellent, mate.
Come here, please.
- I can' t talk right now, mate.
I' ve gotta ask you a question.
- I gotta...
- Come on.
- Can we do it later?
- Please.
It' s important.
Paul, I' m looking for something to do when my character finds out he' s being indicted.
And I was thinking of punching the wall.
But I did that when they killed Uncle Lenny, and I punched a car...... actually, it was a van, when Peezee screwed up the big drug- deal.
So I' m looking for something different this time.
Kick something.
Let me know how it works out.
I gotta go.
Paul, wait.
- Kick what?
- I don' t know.
- Who?
- Anybody, just some guy.
Knock him down, give him a couple shots in the head and walk away.
- Why?
- Why not?
You' re pissed, he' s there.
I got friends waiting for me.
My character wouldn' t do that.
- I don' t know.
You could yell real loud.
- Yell real loud?
Shut your fucking mouth.
I don' t care what you do.
I gotta go.
Shut your fucking mouth.
I gotta go.
- What' d you say?
- What' d you say?
What are you doing?
- Wait.
What are you doing?
- You can cut that shit out right now.
- You can cut that shit out right now.
That was bloody great!
My character could do that.
Thank you.
Jelly?
Where' s Paul?
Michael.
What are you doing?
I' m working for Mr. Vitti.
Oh, no.
No.
No, Michael, you are not doing that.
- You keep telling me to get a job.
- Making sandwiches at the Subway...... not driving a getaway car.
Dad.
All right.
Where is he?
I cannot give you that information.
You cannot give me that information?
I took an oath.
You took an oath?
Was there blood involved?
What...?
What happened?
Where were you?
I' il tell you the truth.
- What?
- My car was totally shot out...... and the men who were chasing us probably drowned.
- It' s not as bad as it sounds.
- When is this all gonna end?
I just have to find him.
Why?
A few days ago you weren' t even sure you wanted to be a therapist.
Honey, I have to finish this.
Understand?
- Go.
Just don' t get shot.
- Please.
- All right.
- Hey, Clemenza.
Where is he?
- I can' t.
You are gonna tell your father...... or so help me God, I' il kick the ever- Ioving shit out of you.
Little Darlings, okay?
It' s a club in Queens.
- Give me the keys to the car.
- I' m responsible for the Town Car.
- Give me the fucking keys!
- Okay.
- Here.
Thank you.
Bye.
Excuse me.
Jelly.
- Hey, doc, what are you doing here?
- Where' s Paul?
- I have to talk to Paul.
Man, give her a few dollars.
Hi.
I only have a 20, so could I get change?
Ten, five, singles would be great.
Thank you.
Okay.
Thank you very much for giving me this.
Listen, this is my meter money, I don' t have any more bills, so...
Where' s Jelly?
Blowing off a little steam.
What' s the big deal?
Here he is.
- How' s it going, Paulie?
- It' s going all right.
You know my guys?
Enormous Bobby and Al Pacino?
Al Pacino?
That' s your real name?
No.
They call me that because I look like Al Pacino.
- The actor.
Why?
Because you look as much like Carol Burnett as you do Al Pacino.
- What are you looking at?
It' s, like, right through here, it' s just very much Pacino.
- We' re all here.
- Then let' s do this, all right?
- Let' s go.
- Let' s do what?
- Let' s go.
You' re not telling me something.
You' re not telling me something.
I want to know what' s going on.
- I' m not leaving till you tell me...
You' re gonna get hurt.
Okay, this is big.
We only got one shot, and there' s a million ways this fucking thing can go wrong...... so everybody listen carefully.
The Federal Gold Depository in downtown Manhattan.
Three times a year, a shipment of Gold bars Goes in a heavily Guarded armored truck...... from the depository to a vault in the Federal Reserve...... to hold for foreiGn Governments that trade in Gold bullion.
Three o' clock in the morninG, about eiGht hours from now...... we' re gonna hijack that truck.
All right, everybody look at the map.
This is where we' re gonna be.
- What the fuck is this?
- He was listening by the door.
- Get rid of him.
- Hi, Carol.
- You' re a dead man, asshole.
Put the gun down.
Put the fucking gun down!
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?
- He can make every guy in this room.
He' s with me.
Yeah?
What, on the job?
- Gonna start that "yeah, what?" shit again?
- Either he' s in or he' s dead.
Which is it?
I think in is better.
If I had a vote, I would vote in.
- He' s in.
He' s my responsibility.
- Okay.
No more surprises.
Got it?
Here, try this on.
- Is this bulletproof?
- You better hope so.
See if it fits under your shirt.
Got anything smaller?
What are we, a Bloomingdale' s?
Hey, nobody knew you were coming down.
You' re lucky to be alive, you know.
We' re all gonna be lucky to be alive.
It' s stupid.
Hey, hey, watch it.
Crazy, but not stupid.
You wanna stay alive?
You do everything I tell you, keep your mouth shut, and try not to pee your pants.
- You mean shoot it?
No, twirl it like a fucking baton.
- No.
- Kalashnikov?
- Jelly.
- Stop me when something hits your fancy.
- Well, can' t I just use that?
This brings back fond memories.
- Use it in good health.
- Thanks.
Cold.
Cold.
- Check everything in there.
- Talk to the doc, I think he' s caving in.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I' m great.
I' il try to get you out before the shit goes down.
- Right.
Here they come.
Big, big mistake.
- They' re here.
Go!
Are you fucking kidding me?
Move the truck!
Where you going?
It' s a setup!
Everybody get down, watch the walls!
Watch the walls and the gates!
On my command, get the drivers back in the trucks.
I' m gonna take the point.
We' re gonna back these fuckers out of here.
- What the fuck?
- They' re lifting the truck!
They' re lifting the fucking truck!
Son of a bitch!
Hold on, Harold!
Hold on!
Hang on!
- It' s not too late.
You don' t have to do this.
Let' s go.
What a day for my balls.
Open the fucking door.
- Where' s the keys?
- We don' t have the keys.
They' ve got the keys at the bank.
Keep your fucking head down.
Here we go.
Take the gate.
You guys take the gate.
Climb the wall.
On the wall, guys.
Get up on the wall!
Move.
You know, this might just fucking work.
Go!
Come on.
Need some backup.
10- 13, shots fired.
Move!
Over the wall!
- Get over the goddamn wall!
- You get over the fucking wall!
Fifty bars.
Fifty bars is all we need.
- Let' s go.
- How much is that?
Do the math.
- 22, 995, 000.
- What?
Give or take.
Hit it again!
They' re breaking down the door.
Bobby, move up the Payloaders.
Move them up.
So much for not peeing in my pants.
- All right, pack it up.
Let' s go.
- Let' s get out of here.
We' re moving out.
Paul, remember what you said about not flipping out?
- Yeah.
- Sorry.
What have I done?
I had a perfect life, and I threw it away!
I' m going to prison.
That' il be bad.
I have delicate features.
- I' m small.
- You gotta calm down!
- I can' t calm down.
I' m gonna die.
- Calm down!
- I can' t breathe!
I' m suffocating!
Relax.
- Get a hold of yourself!
We' re gonna die!
- We' re not gonna die.
We' re all gonna die!
- You feel better now?
I wanted to be there for you.
But I couldn' t because I' m not good enough.
I didn' t think this would hit me this hard.
But, Paul, now I know how you felt when your father was killed.
We don' t have time for this.
- Don' t do this.
- It was 10 times worse for you.
- Don' t do this.
- He was killed right in front of you.
- You were just a little kid.
- Don' t go there.
- But it' s so sad.
I' m telling you...
- All of his dreams for you died with him.
- There I go.
You happy now?
He really loved you.
- I know he did, and I loved him too.
- Loved him too.
I know.
Oh, boy, this is bad.
How' s the heist going?
Did you really think you were gonna live through this?
I had my hopes.
- Well, nice work.
- Mr. Rigazzi will be very grateful.
- I thought he worked for Patti LoPresti.
Patti thought so too, but he played both sides against the middle.
There' s only one side as far as I' m concerned: mine.
What did you think?
So long, Mr. Vitti.
I can' t take it anymore!
That' s what I hate about you fucking sociopaths!
You keep changing the rules to suit yourselves!
Well, not this time, you antisocial, misfit piece of shit!
This time you fucked with the wrong shrink!
You want a fresh one?
This session is over.
Son of a bitch.
Ram it!
Take them up and leave them there.
- Nice going.
Good plan.
- Shut up.
- Bye.
- Yeah, what?
What' s a sociopath?
- Somebody!
- Come on, help us out here.
Come on!
This way!
Come on!
- They' re getting away!
- Let' s go!
Drop your guns!
Drop your guns!
Drop your fucking guns!
Drop your weapons, now!
- Who the hell is this?
- Cut.
Cut.
What the hell is going on?
Drop your fucking guns.
Nobody move!
Raoul!
Look, if you' re gonna change the script, you have to tell us.
What are they doing in my shot?
- What are you doing on my street?
- I have a permit!
- Take your permit and stick it up your ass!
Release traffic, please.
Release traffic.
This is like a bloody Chinese fire drill...
Jesus!
You are in trouble!
- You are gonna be in federal prison!
Prison?
You think I' m powerless?
- No, you' ve gotta stay.
- You, please be quiet.
I' m trying to think.
- Is there a problem, officer?
- Keep your hands where I can see them.
That' s it, we' re screwed.
We are so screwed.
You.
Me?
- You' re one tough shrink.
- All right.
- Feeling pretty good, huh?
- Yeah, I' m feeling pretty good.
I mean, what' s next?
Do you go on the run for the rest of your life?
- How does this work now?
- Those are my choices?
Hey, doc.
Can' t you let me enjoy this for five fucking minutes?
- Must you always be a fucking killjoy?
- Five minutes?
- Five minutes.
Five minutes.
- And then what?
- And then you' il see what.
- I' il see.
WWEN news time, 8: 06.
A quick resolution to last niGht' s spectacular armored- car hijackinG.
FBI aGents, actinG on a tip from an unnamed source...... raided the RiGazzi PlumbinG Company early this morninG...... and recovered the 50 Gold bars stolen in the darinG robbery.
Arrested in the raid were reputed crime family boss Louis "the Wrench" RiGazzi...... and 11 other hiGh- rankinG RiGazzi family associates.
The rest of the stolen bullion was recovered at the crime scene...... alonG with three hiGh- flyinG hijackers apparently stranded...
OrGanized crime has been dealt a serious blow...... and I' m happy to report to the people of New York and to the entire nation...... that this Great city is today a safer place to live and work.
Questions?
Hey, doc.
- Yeah.
I saw her.
- You gonna be okay?
It' s okay.
- Good.
Good.
I spoke to the U. S. attorney.
- What did he say?
But you gotta stay out of trouble.
Fuck him.
So one big happy ending, right?
- Yeah.
Sure.
Why shouldn' t I feel better?
It' s a process.
- It' s a process, I know.
It' s not easy.
But you gotta know you did the right thing.
You too, doc.
- You hung in there.
It took a lot of balls.
- I did what I had to.
You were a monster.
I seen the beast in you.
- A lot of misplaced aggression, that' s all.
I' m gonna send you after people that I don' t like.
Give them a little psychology, then beat them up.
I wanna thank you, doc.
- You don' t have to thank me, Paul.
- You helped me out a lot.
You.
- You' re good, you.
- No, I' m okay.
No, no, no.
You' re very, very good.
You got a gift, my friend.
I' m telling you, you got a gift.
All right, I have a gift.
- Okay.
- Take it easy.
- I' il see you.
- All right.
Hey, doc.
When I was a resident, we used to actually play with the catatonics.
Just to have a little fun, it' s just so dreary.
Okay.
When I was a resident at Downstate...... we used to play with the catatonics, just for a few laughs.
Okay.
I' m not hurting you.
- Marker.
You told her at the drop of a hat.
I see.
And I don' t need this information.
No.
Why tell Paula?
She couldn' t possibly handle a phone call.
- Who am I?
- Laura.
Okay.
- What?
- Somebody said something about coffee.
That was you.
You said you wanted some.
Yeah.
- I know.
I' m taking a long time.
I' m taking my moment.
You also took mine.
Here you go.
Thank you very much.
Hey, Michael.
Jelly.
Michael!
Come on.
Who are we kidding?
- You hated your father.
- I didn' t hate my father.
- No, I loved him.
- You hated your father.
You hated him.
You fucking hated him.
What the fuck we talking about?
- All right.
I got it.
I' il stop.
I can see how touched you are. "
- That' s my line.
- That' s your line.
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?
I came here to tell you that you have a preliminary...
- Come back and try again.
Preliminary meeting.
Preliminary meeting.
You have a preliminary meeting with your parole officer.
Fuck you.
It' s "preliminary."
I' m from the Bronx, and it' s 4: 00 in the morning.
Come in.
Hey, doc, what are you doing here?
- Preliminary.
- Yeah, preliminary.
Come in.
- All right.
A marker.
You know who was always a favorite of mine?
The late, great Groucho Marx.
He would draw them in on his eyebrows and then...
"That' s the most ridiculous thing I' ve heard." He would do stuff like that.
I' m the sheriff of the undersea club.
Salute me, I' m Captain Midnight.
Ultimately, it' s just sad.
That' s what I' ve been jerking off to the last 850 nights, a home- cooked meal.
Yeah, like a nice fucking lamb chop.
A nice home- cooked meal.
- Let me think of a good one.
Help me.
I just wanted to see it again.
- We still going?
Okay.
All right.
That was great.
I think we can move on.
There' s an old saying:
"Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?"
It' s a fascinating philosophical query, marriage versus sex.
And if you' re considering the former...... odds are you' il hear the saying from a friend...... who claims to be getting an abundant amount of the latter.
And incidentally, it' s bullshit.
Bullshit.
You think this is bullshit.
- Yeah.
- Well, it isn' t.
After five years, I think I have the right to broach the subject.
So you broach and we talk.
You don' t have to go and give me an ultimatum.
Don' t use that word.
I hate that word.
I' m not too fond of it either, but what else would you call this?
A deadline.
So I' m a little indecisive.
That doesn' t mean you have to hold a gun to my head.
- Sorry.
- Don' t be so melodramatic.
That' s why I' m taking this transfer.
I' il be 3, 000 miles away.
I can' t hold a gun to your head.
- Stop saying that!
- Shit.
Admit it.
Deadline.
Okay.
So I wouldn' t have signed up for it if you hadn' t freaked on Tyler' s news.
Hello.
David!
What' s up, what' s up?
Tyler, you are wasted.
Sarah.
Damn.
How' d you know, my brother?
- The faux urban street slang.
- Nigger, please!
- What time is it back there, like 2: 00?
- You know this city never sleeps.
Y' all be counting on your sheep.
Listen, man, I met the most amazing woman.
- She is...
- Fly?
Better than fly.
She' s super fly.
What did I tell you about drinking and dating?
Go to bed and sleep her off.
We' re getting married!
What?
You got to meet her, you and Sarah.
She' s like...
- Super fly?
- Better than super fly, man.
She' s the one.
You know how they say that you can just tell?
David?
You still there, bitch?
- Yeah, I' m here.
I' m just...
It just hit me.
It was like a blinding realisation.
Like pure truth.
Anyway, you and Sarah got to meet her.
You' re gonna love her.
Her name' s Julie.
She' s sweet, she' s beautiful...... she' s "chocolicious"...
Tyler?
Hello!
Tyler, you okay?
Sounds like true love.
So you are leaving me alone to deal with this for two months.
You need to be alone to deal with this.
Which is why I strongly advise you against consulting with Mike.
Bellissimo.
Magnifico.
You are so hot!
You beast.
Is that Ricky Martin over there?
God, no.
It' s Mike Hanson.
You' re beautiful.
Modesty, now.
Modesty.
I love you.
No words.
Don' t do it.
I' m doing it.
Don' t do it.
I did it.
I' d do me.
- Oh, man!
The "testy" tuck again?
- Do you like what you see?
- No?
- Would you put on some clothes?
We only got two hours of "Happy Hour" left.
Let me just get my towel, okay?
Got it.
There we go.
You got issues, I mean, real issues.
He may be your friend, but he' s no Deepak Chopra.
He is also not running off to New York.
Use this time to make an informed decision or none of this' il mean anything.
I can' t let this not mean anything.
So you love her, right?
- Of course I love her.
- There you go.
Let' s not get carried away here, guys.
No one' s doubting your love for each other.
A blind man could smell your love.
- But this is a major...
- Huge.
No, colossal, thing you' re considering here.
As your friend, it' s my duty to ask the tough questions.
- What?
- Sex.
- Sex is still good?
- The sex is awesome.
I' ve got no complaints about what we have.
It would be a lot easier if I did.
It' s got to be something.
You waited five years.
- So what is it?
- It' s nothing.
Let' s drop it.
We' re your friends.
We want to help you.
But we can' t do it unless you let us in!
It' s no one thing!
There' s a lot of factors in these kind of situations.
- So what is it?
Give us one.
- Other women, all right?
You' ve had other women?
How many?
I' m not quite sure that I' ve had enough.
- That' s ridiculous.
- Twice your age.
It' s not about quantity, it' s about quality.
What' s wrong with going for both quality and quantity?
Being the best he can be, that' s the American way.
Foul.
- Foul?
- It' s foul.
- What foul?
- Humping before the shot.
- I was humping you?
- Prison- style.
Whatever.
If I was humping you, you' d know it.
- Would I?
- Yeah, you' d know it.
You' d feel it.
I wasn' t humping you.
- Deep, right?
- Yep.
A little help?
The thing is, I never expected to feel empowered.
For better, for worse, something is set into motion...... and I set it off.
Am I a manipulative bitch or what?
Welcome to my world.
You should feel empowered.
It wasn' t easy, but it had to be done.
What was the alternative, to keep waiting?
It' s not like the sex gets better with every passing year.
I' m sorry that was so quick.
I' m kind of beat.
That' s okay.
Orgasms are overrated anyway.
Hey, South Park is on.
You had the courage to look him in the eye and say:
"Buddy boy, it' s time to shit or get off the pot."
And marrying me would be the "shit" part of that colourful analogy?
Thanks.
I' m sorry, I don' t get it.
Sarah is hot.
Behind every good- looking chick is a guy who' s tired of nailing her.
- Am I right, Davey?
- No, you' re wrong, asshole.
Cowgirls, wilder chicks, the Amish, what?
It' s not like that.
Let' s just drop it, all right?
- Do you guys believe in "the one"?
- As in one soul mate?
The perfect match that completes us, makes us whole?
- Exactly.
- Hell, no.
I don' t know.
But if there' s such a thing and Sarah' s it...... then that means it' s inevitable.
It' s a lock, right?
It' s like destiny.
I guess so.
Okay.
So, if it' s inevitable, why rush into it?
- You' re still not telling us everything.
- Of course, I' m not.
You' re my friends.
- It' s stupid, it' s stupid.
- Come on, help us help you.
Please, man.
Okay.
I' m going to tell you guys a little story.
I have never told anyone this before.
Ever.
When I was 18 years old...... my family and I were flying home...... from a vacation we took in the Caribbean.
Very nice beaches.
Club Med.
We were in line to get on board...... when I happened to glance over to the gate across from us...... and that' s when I saw her.
She glowed.
It was like a light all around her.
It was blinding.
I swear I have never felt anything that powerful before or since.
Something about her sucked me away from the plane...... and drew me right back to her.
There she was.
With strength I wish I still possessed...... I floated towards her.
I introduced myself and told her how I felt.
I gave her my address...... and told her if she felt it too, she should write.
Young blood had him some balls.
I had no choice.
I was being driven by a higher power.
Call it "the lightning bolt," call it a connection, destiny, whatever.
- So did she write you?
- Not at first.
Every day I' d check that mailbox.
I checked all that summer, and nothing.
Then one day, it came.
It was more than I could' ve hoped for.
She professed her love to me.
She said that she, too, got a jolt down her spine...... that glorious day we first met.
It was more beautiful and poetic than she was...... which I didn' t think was possible at the time.
I immediately wrote her back.
Make babies.
It was clear to both of us.
We belonged together.
No fear, no doubt.
- Perfect.
- Young love.
As it turned out.
- What?
- Eleven?
Her parents found my letters and...... quite understandably freaked out.
They contacted our local authorities...... who swiftly moved in to stop the town' s budding paedophile.
They made my father promise that his sicko son...... would cease contact with any more little girls.
They left him to scream at me for over an hour about...... how I could flush any chances of a political career down the toilet.
- That' s a fucked up story, man.
- You' re the only people I' ve ever told.
Can you keep it that way?
It makes you seem kind of creepy.
David Collins Graphics.
- Hey.
- Sarah, hey, how are you?
I just thought I' d call and see how you were.
I' m fine.
How are you?
How' s New York?
Busy.
But the city is so incredible.
I wish you were here with me.
Oops, shit.
"Oops, shit," what?
Why "Oops, shit"?
I wish you were here. "
So how are you?
Miss you.
Wish you were here, all that.
I talked to Tyler.
He and I are going to try to get together for dinner.
So maybe I' il get to meet the fiancee.
Great.
Be sure and thank them for ruining my life.
Listen, I just wanted to let you know that I made it here okay.
Oh.
Is that it?
Well, I got to get back to work.
So I should go.
Yeah, me, too.
Okay.
'Bye, David.
I' m just saying, it' s been a week and a half now...... and all you' ve done is sit around the apartment.
It' s no good.
She wants me to give the situation serious thought...... that' s exactly what I' m trying to do.
Finish it, Tiny!
And how' s that working out so far?
Been doing a lot of thinking?
No!
You are useless!
- What was that?
He can' t do that.
- Actually, I think he can.
She wants me to make an informed decision...... and I' m gonna respect that.
No, what she wants is for you to wallow around your apartment...... like some socially- retarded hermit.
Ante up.
Who do you like?
- Give me $5 on Super Thong.
- I' m gonna take the one with the nice rack.
She is banking on your misery, bro, hoping you' il sit around bumming out.
That' s got to hurt.
And that, my friend, is how you make an uninformed decision.
You want to make a truly informed decision?
Get off your ass and go see what it' s like out there.
Get in the game.
I. e.
Hitting the meat market clubs with you.
No.
Hitting them with me and Jonesy.
There are some major fundamental problems I have with...... "Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?" conundrum.
For one thing, women are not cows.
And by that I mean, not so generic.
I think most reasonable people would agree...... that a cow is a cow is a cow.
This is not true of women.
Things might be simpler if it were.
- Yo, Mike!
- Excuse me.
Scotch.
- It' s packed.
- Yeah, busy.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
You might have offered to help me.
If you please?
A beer for my friend?
Thank you.
I' m sorry to do this to you, but I got to go.
- Hey, asshole, what is your problem?
- You shouldn' t drink anymore.
- Why shouldn' t I?
I just got here.
- Because you' re driving me home.
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.
- Hey.
- Buy you a drink?
- Actually, I' m think I' m gonna leave.
- You aren' t married, are you?
- Not yet.
You better hurry, though.
- Another round.
- Did Mikey show?
- Yes.
Cute.
How' d he play?
Actually, I think he used the "You' re less than nothing to me" strategy.
It never fails, man.
- You miss her, huh?
- Are you kidding?
Surrounded by all these available women?
I know the feeling, only worse.
Imagine feeling like that in this place without having anybody to miss.
How you doing?
You ready to go?
Okay, so you had a close encounter with something.
You saw the light in the airport.
And 10 years later, it' s still messing with your head.
It was important.
It set the bar for me on some level.
Is that so bad?
It' s bad if it keeps you from hooking up with a woman...... who' s attractive, smart, and of legal, consenting age.
What if she' s still out there?
Don' t I owe it to myself...... to try and find her?
You' re hunting Sasquatch.
- See.
There she is.
- The shadow lady?
She' s a Sasquatch?
She' s a myth.
The perfect woman.
A figment of our dumb- ass male imagination.
Slap a face on the shadow bitch, and she ceases to be perfect...... because she becomes real.
- So what exactly is all this crap?
- It' s market research.
Insurance for the creatives who came up with this shitty campaign.
If I can coerce a focus group...... to say that a picture of an anorexic model...... bottle- feeding two large men in diapers...... makes them want to buy a pair of jeans, then I' ve done my job.
I know.
But at least it' s the fashion biz, right?
So why don' t you just move here?
- I don' t know.
- Who is that?
- It' s Mr. Hahn.
My boss.
- And you get paid?
Look at it mathematically.
If just one person hooks up with somebody who isn' t their soul mate...... you got a chain reaction that screws it up for everybody on the planet.
Your soul mate ends up with someone else' s who settles for someone else' s...
Which makes it all the more important to find the right person.
It' s a glass- half- empty, glass- half- full scenario.
If you ask me, the glass is half full of crap.
You sure you don' t want any late night eats?
I' m out of here.
Take care, man.
- You got a problem?
- How' s the chili?
I' d give my right arm for a bowl.
I' il hand that...
I' il have that.
Oh, my God.
My God, that was the glow.
That was the feeling you got in the airport.
It' s happening again.
I' m gonna do this.
Can you do this?
You' ve done it before, you can do it again.
I' m gonna do this.
I' m gonna do this.
Can you?
Don' t let her get away.
- Where did she go?
Where did that girl go?
- What' s your problem?
She left, crap sack.
Creep.
Wait up!
Stop!
Stop!
Wait up!
Don' t go!
Don' t!
Quick Match Personals.
May I help you?
I' d like to place a personal ad.
I' m sorry, can you please speak up?
A personal ad.
I want to place a personal...
Hello.
Is anyone there?
Hello?
I' m sorry.
I' m here.
This is my first time.
Okay.
Here goes.
Wanted...... soul mate.
Potential soul mate looking for his soul mate.
You, soul- mate material.
Me, open, intelligent, and...
Soul- matey?
Yes.
Who' s dead?
Somebody better be dead.
Hey, Tyler, it' s Mikey.
Did I wake you?
What time is it?
It' s 1: 00 in the morning, 4: 00 to you.
Sorry, man.
What' s wrong?
What happened?
- Nothing.
I just wanted to talk.
- At 4: 00 in the morning?
It' s cheaper.
Listen, Ty, how' d you do it?
- How' d I do what?
- How did you, you know...
How did you find somebody who made the cut?
I don' t know.
It was just this feeling that hit me.
Like a blinding realisation, like pure truth.
- Mikey, what is this all about?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Forget it.
Congratulations.
- Mike?
- Yeah?
Pull this shit again, you don' t get to be my best man.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Always a best man, never a man.
Oh, my God, this is so exciting.
I think I just met Naomi Campbell' s hair person.
So, anything I should be doing?
This is the glamorous world of Market Research.
We just sit around until somebody wonders.
Why are those men wearing diapers?
I guess I can answer that question for you, sir.
- You can answer that?
- Yes.
We did research in the Midwest which indicated...... that our target market was getting younger and younger...... as you can see.
Our focus groups taught us that it' d be wise to do a preemptive strike...... and showcase young imagery in our new campaigns.
I see and this explains why I' m spending $2 million...... putting grown men in Huggies.
You realise if I did this in my basement...... and post them on the internet, I' d be arrested.
Also save a lot of money.
What are you doing for lunch?
I' m sorry Julie couldn' t make it tonight.
She really does want to meet you.
- Me, too.
- Yeah.
But at least now you can tell me how all of this happened.
- You used to refer to marriage as...
- I know, cruel and unusual punishment.
- It' s her.
She just hit me like a truck.
- But you were ready for it, right?
- You were wandering around in traffic?
- Yeah, I guess it was in traffic.
I mean, if it can happen to me, it can happen to anybody.
Right?
Anybody who isn' t Mike, of course.
I actually got a strange call from Mike the other day.
I think he seemed genuinely concerned not to have somebody in his life.
Mike, in a relationship?
Isn' t that one of the signs of the Apocalypse?
Nostradamus actually predicted it.
He said, in the latter part of the twentieth century...... "the lone cock would crow no more."
That' s scary.
Why do you think David' s so reluctant to take the next step with me?
Oh, David.
I was playing the field, and I got burned out on it.
David hasn' t exactly been out playing the field.
- He' s been playing house with me.
- A fun game.
So let me get this straight.
By working in a relationship with this guy for the past five years...... I have actually undermined any possibility of a future with him?
Yeah.
Maybe.
I don' t know.
David' s a really sharp guy...... and I think he' il probably come to his senses.
- I mean, you' re all he wants.
- I' m all he knows.
That can work.
David, it' s me.
It' s late and you' re not home.
That' s good.
I hope you' re out having fun.
I know this sounds weird...... but if you need to see other women to figure this out...... I can handle it.
Maybe it' s being here on my own or from asking you for a decision.
I' ve gained a new perspective on things.
I think it' s important for us to explore whatever options we need to.
So, if that' s part of it for you just know that I understand.
I know what you mean.
She second- guessed our move.
She' s even more cunning than I thought.
She' s good.
You' re lucky I' m on board.
It' s not like her.
Why would she say it' s okay to go out with other women?
Why indeed?
Shouldn' t you be out there playing wingman for Jonesy?
Oh, please.
I never realised you were so picky.
You think I' m one of these assy scam hounds?
I have very particular tastes.
A strict list of qualities I look for in a woman.
I' m not just fucking around out here.
Seriously, all this play I get?
It' s practice.
- It' s practice for the big game.
- Maybe it' s not a game.
You' ve been off the circuit too long.
Of course, it' s a game.
It' s better than a game, it' s a sport.
It' s better than a sport, even.
It' s sport fishing.
Case in point.
Look at him.
See those chicks he' s wasting it on.
Hi, ladies!
Those are bass.
And we all go bass fishing from time to time.
Hell, you can get really good at it with practice.
But while he' s spending all his time hooking up with bottom feeders...... the crucial skills he' il need to hook his wife are atrophying.
You see, scamming is like fishing.
If your dream girl were a fish, what would she be?
- I don' t know, a tuna?
- Yeah!
A marlin.
A big trophy fish.
To catch a marlin, you must use entirely different skills.
You don' t go out marlin fishing with a sorry- ass fold- out pole, six- pound test.
That' il do for bass.
But it sure as shit isn' t gonna land a marlin.
You have to up your game.
Know where the elusive beauties lie.
You gotta know where to fish.
They' re rare.
Most days you don' t catch shit.
But when you do...
Wham!
The two of you are back at the dock taking pictures.
Okay, another huge flaw I have...... with "Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?"...... is simply this.
Milk is not free.
The point is, if you' re hankering for some milk...... one way or another, you' re gonna have to pay for it!
You digging this, Davey?
I told you I' d make it up to you.
Please point out which of these lovely young ladies is a marlin.
We' re done fishing for the day.
We' re at the aquarium now, checking out the exotic fishies.
Look, Davey.
They even got one of those petting tanks.
Oh, my God.
I have already told him all about you, and his friend is totally hot.
Sarah, come on.
You have got to get my back.
I have been after this guy for almost a week.
They' re gonna be here in an hour.
So, come on, just get my back.
I have to go.
I' il do what I can.
'Bye.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Have you given any thought to our conversation the other day?
It' s all I' ve been thinking about.
But the problem is, I' m involved with someone back in LA.
But I' m not sure what' s happening with us.
I just need a little more time to figure it out.
Is that okay?
Of course.
Just don' t take too long.
Gosh, a dollar.
Now I can quit stripping, go back to vet school...... and save my sick pony.
Thanks, Mike.
You' re a prince.
- Amy!
- David, you know her!
Holy shit!
It is Amy.
Give me a sec.
I have to make one last go- around.
You guys know her?
From school.
I can' t believe this is happening.
- I can' t believe this is happening.
- She looks great.
- She definitely lost that "Freshman 15."
- She looks hot.
Hey, you guys.
How are you two?
- You work here?
This is awesome.
- No, Mike, I' m just hanging.
- This is such a surprise.
- Yeah.
You look good, David.
Amy, this is Jonesy.
Jonesy, this is Amy.
- How you doing?
- Pleasure to meet you.
The pleasure is all mine.
Why don' t you turn it down a notch?
You' re channelling Barry White again.
Was she this hot when you two were dating?
- He went out with a stripper?
- Yeah.
Actually, no.
I was just a freshman back then...... studying to be a stripper.
David helped me bone up on my pole- dancing exam.
Can I buy you a drink for old times' sake?
- Yeah.
- Come on.
They' re going to do it.
I often wonder how long we would' ve lasted if I hadn' t broken up with you.
Two and a half days.
I was gonna dump you right after my last final.
I didn' t have the time to get into a big emotional thing with you.
- I had to study.
- What a relief.
This whole time, I thought I broke your heart.
Give me a break.
We weren' t in love or anything.
We were just having fun.
- There were no expectations back then.
- Give me a hand with this.
I mean, when did that change?
It didn' t.
You did.
It only seems different now because you outgrew it.
- I don' t know.
- I do.
Look at your dick- with- ears friend there.
Do you think that Amy chick would take the bid?
- I thought that was Dave' s old flame.
- Key word: "was."
Damn it!
I bet I could have had her.
When she was going out with your best friend.
Yeah, that would have been real cool.
You bet.
Although, I' m sure she wasn' t as hot then.
- You look unbelievable.
- Thanks.
When did it get so difficult to figure out what I want?
If you' re like most people, darlin '...... right around the time you found something worth wanting.
Hand me that dildo, will you?
She circled my ad.
She circled my ad!

Hola, soul mate.
I have searched for you for a long time.
I think we should get together.
I have dark hair, dark eyes and a nipple key ring.
I' m a maid, so I have lots of keys.
Your ad intrigued me, soul mate.
A little about myself:
I love dressing up and getting down.
I' m a walking contradiction...... open- minded, yet lactose intolerant.
And I yearn for someone who enjoys big surprises.
Call me.
If you' d like to make a call, please hang up and try again.
Hello, David.
I' ve been waiting for your call...... ever since I saw you in that Mexican restaurant.
I' ve fantasised about us.
- Our bodies entwined and covered in salsa.
- Salsa!
We' re destined to be together, David.
- It' s just like...
- Chips and salsa.
That' s right.
And now...
That' s my other line.
Hold on.
- Hello.
- David, it' s Mike.
You there?
Come on, pick up, David.
This is important.
- Mike.
- David, it' s happened to me.
Congratulations.
Look, I' m really not feeling very...
Listen, David.
I' m lying naked, in a strange bed...... staring at the most beautiful woman...... I have ever seen in my entire life.
Tell her I said, "Hi."
I' ve really got to go now.
She' s not here.
I' m looking at her picture, okay?
Damn marlin jumped right into my boat, caught me unawares.
What are you talking about?
That whole after- hours rave?
Complete blank.
The last solid memory I have was drinking some green, glowy shit...... from a test tube and dancing like a bastard.
- But, David...
- What?
Something magical happened in this room last night.
Something...... bigger than sex.
- Although sex was definitely a factor.
- But you don' t remember.
No.
Last night' s a total blur.
But listen to me.
I woke up this morning and I' ve got...
... the feeling.
- Is it a burning sensation?
No, David.
The feeling...... when you just know the pure, blinding truth stuff.
I' ve met her, David.
Me.
Shit.
Here she comes.
Moment of truth.
'Bye.
Good morning, sunshine!
Is that for me?
Whoops.
You' ve been, deflowered.
I can' t believe you' re even up after that performance last night.
In my book, you deserve to sleep for a week.
Hungover and clumsy.
I' il take care of that.
You just save your strength.
- The bathroom?
- What?
- The bathroom.
I don' t feel too well.
- It' s right around the corner, lover.
You pretty boys are all the same.
Strong stamina and weak stomachs.
It' s right there.
You okay in there?
This isn' t happening.
- Michael?
- Just a sec!
Laura was pretty impressed with you last night...... even before you two started waking the neighbourhood.
I love chicks.
Breasts, legs, long hair.
And breasts.
I' ve never seen her make breakfast for herself.
And we' ve been roommates for three years.
Laura ran to the store to get you some B12...... and she should be back soon.
Dad.
Sit down.
I' m gay.
No!
Or I was fucked up or experimenting.
You know, like Mom' s college years.
Oh, God, it is genetic.
Michael, I' il be out on the deck, okay?
When you' re done, let' s talk.
After what happened last night...... it would mean a lot to me if we got to know each other better.
Yeah!
You bet!
I' il be right out!
Jumpy little breeder.
Shit!
Stop it!
You' re scalding me!
Wow!
That was just like Spiderman!
Actually, kid, I am Spiderman...... and I lost my costume.
Sure, Spidey.
- This is so cool.
- Yeah.
I' il give you a little hand here.
Billy!
Get away from that man!
No, no, no.
Sir, I can explain.
No, it' s not this.
Sir!
Sick son of a...
No, no.
Daddy, no.
Don' t shoot Spidey.
He' s my special friend.
Billy!
Stop, drop and roll!
Don' t do it!
Run, Spidey, run!
Okay, dog, it' s Snausage time.
This country has just gone to shit.
Damn.
Look at that little sodomite go.
Nice work, Laura.
Another asshole.
Hello, is Susan there?
Hi, Susan.
My name is David.
You answered my personal ad a couple...
Yeah, that' s the one.
That' s me.
Hi, how are you?
Nice to talk to you.
Listen...... I think we should probably get together sometime soon.
Hi, Cynthia.
That' s right.
Soul mate guy.
What do you say, Papa Shan, 5: 00, Tuesday?
All right.
We' il see you then.
Going to hell.
Hi, Kathleen.
I got it.
Tuesday, Papa Shan.
Tuesday, Papa Shan, 5: 00?
I don' t know.
Papa Shan, 5: 00, Tuesday?
Hi.
Excuse me.
You aren' t David by any chance, are you?
No.
No.
Sorry.
I' m going straight to hell for this.
- David?
- It' s Ralph.
Close enough.
Sorry, I' m meeting someone.
I have to get out of here.
- Hi, David.
- Nicole, what are you doing in LA?
I' m in town for my cousin' s bar mitzvah.
What are you doing?
I' m leaving.
This place is such a meat market.
It' s a total singles scene.
- Yeah.
That is his name.
It' s my nickname.
My close friends call me that.
- David, what are you talking about?
- Who the hell has David for a nickname?
I do.
It' s short for Davidian.
Branch Davidian.
- Are you here to meet a David, too?
- Yeah.
Who are you?
Did you answer an ad in Quick Match Personals?
- David, do you know these women?
- You son of a...
Soul mate, my ass!
Stop it, please!
Excuse me, I' m supposed to meet someone here named...
Some shit monkey invited four women from the same dating service!
Why?
Look, just get down here, all right?
And send ambulances, lots of them.
I' m sorry!
I' m sorry!
I' ve been a bad boy!
I' m sorry!
How does it look?
Is it bad?
No.
You' re good.
So, we' re about the same age.
Tell me, how does one develop such intense hatred for women...... in a short amount of time?
Publicly humiliating four women you' ve never met before?
I thought maybe I had met one of them before.
I was wrong.
Go ahead, call Sarah.
Rat my miserable ass out.
Forget it.
I' d lash out at an entire gender too if I had your problems.
It must be tough.
You' re the last person I would have expected sympathy from on all this.
It can' t be easy.
Especially now.
What do you mean, now?
Maybe you' d better call her.
Sarah, pick up the damn...
- Hello.
- Hello, Sarah?
I work with Sarah.
Can I take a message?
I need to know where she is.
She left a little early today.
Had a dinner engagement.
An appointment.
- With who?
- Who is this?
This is her boyfriend, David.
I didn' t know she had a boyfriend.
She does.
Listen, I' m sorry.
I really don' t know who you are...... but I' d appreciate it if you told me who she was...
She' s out with Andrew.
Mr. Hahn.
- Mr. Hung?
- Yeah, the big guy.
Are you sure you' re her boyfriend?
I mean, she knows that you' re her boyfriend and everything right?
So how long have you been married?
- Seven years.
- Must be nice to have that kind of security.
I' m the poster boy for happily married.
But security, that' s a rare thing these days...... especially in marriage.
That' s a sombre outlook for the happily- married, poster boy.
Fifty percent divorce rate in the US.
The only security you have in this world is yourself.
The point I' m making, Sarah, is your talent is yours alone.
And you do have talent, Sarah.
Your designs are amazing.
Only you can decide what you want to do with that talent.
- I just wish it were simpler.
- Simpler?
I' m offering you a job in New York doing what you love doing.
I know.
And it' s a dream come true.
Dreams don' t come true very often.
Maybe it' s not supposed to be simple.
Bellissimo.
Magnifico.
Mike, it' s me.
Where you been, man?
I haven' t heard from you since you met your true love.
I' ve really got to talk to you.
So why don' t you just pick up the phone and give me a call between orgasms, okay?
From the makers of the hit videos, Are You Gay?... and So You Think You' re Gay...... United Homosexual Headquarters presents...... Just How Gay Are You?
Hello.
I' m Tim Chadway...... President of United Homosexual Headquarters.
My buddies call me Timbo.
You know, like millions of Americans...... you' re probably wondering just how gay are you?
That' s an important question.
But, come on, the answer is pretty obvious, isn' t it?
Face it, chief.
If you' re watching me now, you are pretty damn gay.
But that' s okay.
Because, you see, here at the Headquarters...... we specialise in making your journey out of the closet...... as smooth as possible.
From our handy Gay Pride Starter Kit...... to those convenient, "I' m here, I' m queer...
"... stop by sometime for a beer" change- of- sexual- orientation post cards...... you' il be out and about in no time.
Your family and friends will admire you...... for your ability to make that transition with style and flair.
- I still can' t believe it.
- Why don' t you just call her?
You don' t even know for sure what' s going on.
If she wants to talk, she can give me a call.
I' m done sitting around like a sucker.
- You got to stop being hard on yourself.
- Mike was right.
If I' m gonna make an informed decision, it' s time I started getting busy.
Wait a minute.
What' s this bar that Mike wants us to meet him at?
"The Cock Pit."
You might want to wait till tomorrow night to start getting busy.
Why is that?
Because tonight, we' re drinking in Boys' Town.
A lot of guys claim they practically knew it in the womb.
Like something was wrong...... they felt different than all the other fetuses.
How did you figure it out?
After a string of girlfriends...... a couple ex- wives, and a Great Dane or two...... I started thinking, "Hey, maybe it' s me."
- Was that difficult for you?
Most terrifying thing that you can do is look inside yourself carefully, honestly.
But you have to do it, Michael.
And when I did, it was a feeling that just hit me.
A blinding realisation like pure truth.
- Mike, what' s up?
- Guys, hey!
Sit down.
- Are you aware that this is a...
- A gay bar?
It' s okay to say it.
And yes, I know.
But I like it, I think.
Stanley!
A beer for my friends, please.
- I get it.
I get it.
- You do?
He' s trying to go the distance with that chick he met at After Hours.
Right.
Avoiding places that tempt you to stray...... off the gilded path of monogamy.
I can' t wait to meet this girl.
She must really be something.
She didn' t...... turn out to be the person I thought she was.
- Sorry, man.
- I' m sorry.
She sounded different.
Let' s just drop it, okay?
So what' s up with this bar?
This isn' t really our kind of place.
What do you mean?
It' s got beer.
It' s got bar stools.
- What more do you need, Jonesy?
- How about women?
I' m shocked.
I never would have pegged you two as homophobes.
What the hell do you guys have against gay people, anyway?
We' ve got nothing against gays.
Some of my best friends' friends are gay.
That' s right.
- Holy shit.
- What' s that?
The Mikey Chronicles, man.
The Sacred Scam Scrolls.
This is the black book?
I want you to have it, David.
I don' t need it anymore.
Look at all these numbers.
What are these little black diamonds?
Stick to the blue squares.
I' d hate to see you get hurt.
This is bigger than I thought.
That chick must have really snuck up from behind and nailed you.
David?
You must be Nikki.
I hope I' m not too early.
- So you' re a friend of Mike' s?
- Yeah.
David, Mike owes me $200.
Is cash okay?
Hi.
Come on in.
David.
What are you doing here?
If you' re this upset, then why has it taken you two weeks to call me back?
I' ve been busy.
Never mind that.
Who' s this guy?
He' s my boss.
And all he did was offer me a new position.
What' s the matter, our old positions aren' t good enough for you anymore?
As a designer.
He wants an answer, but I told him I had to talk to you first.
This is about more than a job offer.
You tell me to explore, to meet other women.
That' s got nothing to do with this.
I can' t make a decision until I know all the variables...... one of which is still in your hands.
Great.
So now I' m just a variable.
This has just gotten more complicated.
You love it there.
You don' t want to say no to this offer and I' m not going to be a reason you do.
Look, if you already have made up your mind, then say so.
But don' t try to hide behind some noble gesture...... of not holding me back.
Why don' t we be fair here?
Things have changed, Sarah.
This is no longer just my decision.
You' re right, it isn' t.
And that' s why I' m coming home early.
What?
They' re paying for me to come home and talk to you.
They really want me, David.
Possibly more than you do.
Oh, shit.
Dave!
What' s up, man?
De- bachelorising for the little lady.
She gets back today.
You didn' t get me a coffee?
I didn' t know how you took it.
But here, I grabbed your mail on the way in.
So what' s the verdict?
I get to comb the thrift stores for a new, used suit or what?
Not yet.
I' m just as confused as ever.
Are you all right?
- Just lock up when you leave.
- What?
I wasn' t sure if you' d be here.
I' m here.
Where else would I be?
- What' s this?
- I' m going to New York.
What?
- What?
- There' s somebody I got to see.
- What are you talking about?
- Options, remember?
Just in case.
You' re out of options!
This means staying here or going back.
These are your options.
- Sarah.
- No, listen.
Listen to me carefully.
I flew back here for one reason...... and that was to give you a chance to talk me out of taking this job.
I can' t do that until I do this.
I won' t be here when you get back.
I swear to God, I won' t.
This is it, David.
I know.
There are times in life when you have to make extremely difficult choices.
And there are times when it seems like you don' t have a choice at all.
Like those rare moments...... when your only option practically shows up in your mailbox.
- David!
- Tyler.
I' m psyched you' re here.
- You look great.
- It really means a lot to me.
- So what the hell are you doing here?
- I know it' s sudden.
I just wanted to see you.
Things are gonna start getting crazy for you and Julie.
And I wanted to see you.
Both of you.
I talked to Sarah, you know.
She said that you guys met up when she was in town.
No.
I talked to her about three hours ago.
She called, while you were in the air, from LA.
- She' s freaking out.
- Everything' s fine.
I know what you' re going through.
It' s a scary leap.
The trick is you have to let go of your fears...... and just kind of go for it.
Believe me, the worst thing you can do is lose the right girl...... because of a fear of commitment.
The worst thing you can do is marry the wrong girl...... because of a fear of loneliness.
I can' t wait for you to meet her.
I' ve told her all about you.
You have?
Yeah.
I told her about all you guys.
I had to warn her.
Even my name?
You didn' t mention my name.
No, of course not your name.
We refer to you all by your general nature, like the Indians.
Mike is "Fucks Whatever Moves."
You' re "Dances Around Major Life Decisions."
What' d she say, when you mentioned my name?
- What is wrong with you?
What would she possibly say about...
Oh, there she is.
This is David.
David, this is Julie.
So nice to finally meet you.
I feel like I already know you.
- I feel the same way.
- Isn' t she beautiful?
You look like I did first time I laid eyes on her.
I just knew right away.
It hit me like a blinding realisation, like...
Pure truth.
Was he always this sappy?
- Since I met you, baby.
- Will you order me a drink?
I' m going to go to the ladies' room.
Excuse me.
Now you know, buddy.
Now you understand.
That' s it.
This guy Jeff works at Tyler' s firm...... knew my roommate, and they hooked us up.
End of story.
That' s...
Wow, what a story.
The important thing is that you ended up together?
Yeah.
I mean, think of all the people you' ve met in your lives.
All the paths taken, not taken.
You can probably trace back to your very first romantic memory.
- Lf you tried.
- Oh, yeah.
Fifth grade drama class.
Miss Liska had us lie on the ground and pretend we were driftwood.
And then as she walked around the "beach"...... she would step over us...
- We get it.
That' s nice, sweetie.
What about you, Julie?
Oh, no.
The airport guy?
The airport guy?
What about the airport guy?
- Tell me about this airport guy.
- It' s okay, honey.
He' s a friend.
Okay.
I was travelling with my family once.
We were in an airport...... and this guy came up to me from out of nowhere.
And he started, saying all these strange things to me...... about how he felt something when he saw me...... and he wondered if I felt it, too.
I didn' t know what to say, so I just kind of smiled at him.
He gave me his address...... and asked, if I felt the same I should write him.
And as he walked away, I had this frozen grin on my face.
I didn' t want to agitate him or anything.
I was terrified that he was going to hurt me.
Can you believe that?
How old were you, honey?
- Eleven.
- Eleven years old.
If that son of a bitch were here right now...
But you wrote him!
I mean, did you ever write him?
No.
Of course not.
Honey, do you want me to finish the story for you?
- There' s more?
- Yeah.
No, it' s okay.
I can do this.
So as soon as the guy was gone I threw the address away.
But what I didn' t know at the time was that my little sister Katie...... who was two years younger than me...... saw everything.
She wanted to be like me.
She worshipped me and she started writing this creep, as me.
She even sent him my picture.
Then, of course, when he wrote back...... weird stuff about how he wanted to run away with her...... and make babies.
Can you imagine that?
Make babies?
And this is before the Internet.
What a sicko.
- I' m sorry, honey.
Are you all right?
- But...... did you ever find out who this guy was?
My parents did.
Sort of.
They overheard Katie bragging to me about her boyfriend.
She had mentioned it before...... so we just assumed it was this imaginary play friend or something.
But when she started telling me about how he' d promised to run away with her...... and make love to her...
- Under the stars.... they stepped in.
She was only nine.
So my dad called the authorities...... gave them the guy' s address...... and, as was his style, told us to forget the whole thing!
It wasn' t until years later...... that I realized the guy thought he was writing me.
And then I pieced it together, and I remembered the airport incident.
But I never told anyone.
I have to go.
- Are you all right?
- Where are you going?
I have to...
Thank you for the...
Congratulations with...
Good- bye.
I' d seen the light.
It was this glaringly- obvious, blind realisation...... like pure truth.
And it was not about anyone in particular, but about people in general.
I realised at that moment there is no such thing as "the one."
It' s more of a mind- boggling, whole hell of a lot of potential ones.
And while that should be comforting, it was actually pretty terrifying.
We' d all like to kick back and wait for some magical force...... to show us who we should spend the rest of our lives with.
But the truth is...... there isn' t a lightning bolt to slap you on the ass...... and tell you to pick this person over all others.
If anything, it' s like the rain.
Rain falls all the time.
Sometimes you' re prepared for it, sometimes you' re not.
Depending where you are when it hits you either get caught or you don' t.
In fact, most of us usually try like hell to avoid it.
You might catch the bus.
Maybe you remembered your umbrella, maybe you didn' t.
No big signs.
Just random, torrential bursts of opportunity.
And that' s the most fate can do.
The rest is up to us.
And now, by the power vested in me...... I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
So the eternal bachelor was the first one to go.
I don' t think I' il ever understand men.
- You look amazing.
- Thanks.
I' m very happy for you.
I mean it.
Thanks.
I had a tough time for those first few months.
It was really hard.
But then I had to take Nicole to the emergency room...... to get her stomach pumped again and there he was.
Our eyes just met...... and it was like this indescribable feeling like...
I get it.
Not that happy yet.
It' s terrific you found someone who deserves you.
But I' d be lying if I said I didn' t miss our friendship.
Okay.
I think it' s time to stir things up on the dance floor.
Join me?
I think I' il pass.
I didn' t bring any singles with me.
Joke.
Please remember there are impressionable children out there.
- No problem.
Hand me that dildo, will you?
- Amy.
- Yeah.
- Haven' t seen her since college.
- She' s great.
- You two...
- No.
We' re just friends.
I saw that goofy- looking bastard that Sarah' s with.
That guy, he' s like missing a chromosome or something.
- What a freak.
- We both know he' s an attractive guy.
But, thank you for trying.
I bet he' s no brain surgeon.
Shit.
Really?
There you are.
Baby, you remember David.
You met him at the restaurant a couple months ago.
Glad you didn' t have to rush out early today.
It was a beautiful ceremony.
Thank you.
I' m just glad my little sister got to catch the end.
Katie showed up?
Honey, that' s great.
What happened?
- Your sister is here?
- Yeah.
But she doesn' t like weddings.
She never got over that airport guy.
- The paedophile, the sicko.
- Asshole.
Honey, settle down.
You know I should really introduce you two.
- You would totally hit it off.
- What a great idea.
- Why don' t you go get her?
- No, no.
That' s not necessary.
- Virgin.
- I think I see her.
Stay here.
I' il be right back.
What' s the matter?
You look like you did the night at the restaurant when you...
I have to go.... bolted.
- Lightning Taxi.
I need a cab.
Fast.
Ladies and gentlemen at this time, Mike Hanson, the best man...... would like to make a toast to Julie and Tyler.
All right, thank you.
Thank you.
Many of you don' t know me...... but I had the pleasure of being...... Tyler' s roommate in our fraternity house at school.
Yeah, you were!
Who' s my boy, Mikey?
You' re my boy!
And today I have the privilege...... of being the best man in his wedding.
Suffice it to say, I was shocked to hear that he was getting married.
But over time as I talked to him on the phone...... I began to understand.
We used to do everything together.
We were joined at the hip.
It struck me that what these two people were doing...... was giving themselves in to...... a blinding realisation.
Pure truth.
They stood before everyone they knew and confessed their new found selves.
I don' t know, but witnessing such strength...... and courage in my friends...... inspires me in a way which I can barely put into words.
You see, while many of you don' t know me...... the rest of you only think you do.
The truth is you' re about to meet Mike Hanson for the first time.
My name is Mike Hanson...... and I' m a raging homosexual.
Thank you.
I didn' t really know him that well.
And let' s give it up to the newlyweds.
Congrats, guys.
Hit it.
Why does everybody keep trying to set me up?
They' re never him.
Katie, please come out and meet him.
You look amazing.
All right, let' s go meet this guy.
Ladies!
There you are!
- Katie, I' m so glad that you could make it.
- Thank you.
The limo is here.
- Wait.
Have you seen David?
No.
I think he left with Mike and Amy because I haven' t seen them, either.
But you know what?
We should forget about them.
I' m gonna meet you up front.
We really have to go.
- It' s okay.
You just go.
- No.
You' re coming with us.
No.
It' s your day.
Don' t worry about me.
I' il be fine.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
Just go, all right?
- Love you.
- Love you, too.
So, I don' t mean to belittle your big announcement...... but come on, Mike, you never even worked retail.
It makes sense.
All my life I' ve treated women like dirt, never letting them get too close...... just using and cruising.
That doesn' t make you a homosexual.
It makes you an asshole.
- Excuse me, are you waiting for someone?
- No, I' m not waiting, I' m not waiting.
That' s my...
These insolent swine!
They call you and they tell you to come right away.
And you come, they' re not there.
How do you say, "assholes"?
Yeah, I know the feeling.
You know the feeling?
Do you know the feeling?
So it was nice wedding, yes?
No, not again!
My God!
No, no.
Please get up.
Are you all right?
It' s you.
I have been looking everywhere for you.
What took you so long?
I feel all tingly inside.
I know.
So do I.
No, in a scary way.
Right.
We should get you to a hospital.
What are you doing?
You said you were gay.
Yeah, and your point is?
Hi.
I' m Johnny Knoxville.
Welcome to Jackass.
Hello.
I' m Johnny Knoxville and I' m about to rent a car.
What' s up?
Uh, I have a reservation.
Okay, I need a driver' s license and a credit card.
All right.
I need a signature here that you' re going to use your coverage instead of ours.
Is that white one us?
Yes.
We' re gonna walk around and inspect it together.
Looks pretty good.
I' m just looking for dents and major scratches.
Yeah.
Something major, gonna write it down.
Little ding there.
Yeah.
No, we' il take good care of her.
Thank you.
Have a good week.
Thank you.
I' m Johnny.
Hey.
We' re gonna be doing a hell of a lot of work here today.
Trust us.
We' re gonna have fun.
I' m Johnny Knoxville, and this is called the...
Oh, fuck!
Shut the car off.
Oh, fuck!
I guess we didn' t reinforce the windshield.
That fucker comes... missed me by that much.
That' s why you got the roll bars behind you, dude.
Whose car is this?
This is your guys' car.
I rented it from you earlier.
Yes.
Yeah, wha...?
Yeah, I hit a dog.
A dog isn' t gonna do that.
Come on in.
I had a accident, as you can see.
I was...
I mean, I drink.
I just black out, so I, um...
Were you drinking or anything?
Yeah, I had a little, to be honest.
Is there any license plates on it?
There was.
Yeah?
Well, hopefully you guys will incur some of the cost.
Oh, no.
'Cause I rented it from you guys fair and square.
I don' t want to get stuck with the whole charge of it.
Well, you are going to get stuck with the entire thing.
Well, I don' t think I should.
I think you guys should help.
No.
You declined any additional coverage.
Right there.
You declined it.
Yeah, but that' s just paperwork, you know?
It' s a legal contract.
Yeah, but I was a little...
I was...
I had a few to drink when I signed that, too, so...
We' re gonna have to get this worked out.
Yeah, you' re gonna have to pay for that car.
Well, you' re gonna have to help me pay for that car.
No, we don' t do that.
I returned it with a full tank of gas.
You returned it demolished.
Well, it' s got a full tank of gas.
That' s the least of our worries right now, is the gas.
Oh.
This is an unmitigated outrage.
I' ve never seen anything like this before.
What does that mean?
No one' s ever done that.
Well, I can' t pay for it.
Well, you' re gonna have to.
Well, I ain' t.
Look, I' m gonna let you two guys work it out and I' m gonna go outside but, um, that car' s gonna have to be paid for.
"F" you!
You all right?
You all right?
Knoxville knocked my nuts in half.
This is...
Oh, it hurts my teeth!
I can' t even turn it off.
I thought it was supposed to help.
Okay, you ready?
Yeah.
I' m taking care of you.
- It' s all right.
- Oh, my God, it' s so bad.
You cool?
Okay.
Come on.
Ease up.
Come on.
Daddy' s gotcha.
Oh, my God, it' s so fucking bad.
Come on.
Whoo!
You' re gonna have tits of steel.
Oh!
Yeah, you' re so buff right now.
Yeah, this goes on the gooch.
Yeah, it goes- goes around.
This goes on the gooch.
Oh, dude, he' s done.
Who' s gonna do the gooch?
In case you didn' t know what the gooch is the gooch is the spot between your balls and butt hole, and...
Ooh!
Oh!
- Ooh!
- Does it smell?
- Does it smell like "man"?
Just smell it.
Ehren, smell it.
No, come on.
All right, let' s zap my nuts.
Yeah, yeah, let' s get it over with.
- Are we ready?
- They' re so gone, man.
Okay.
He likes it!
He li...
He likes it.
Afternoon.
How you doing?
Oh...
Son of a bitch.
What happened?
Oh!
Oh!
Yes!
That was the best thing I' ve ever seen.
Oh, fuck, dude.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Get over here!
Help him!
Help him!
Medic!
No, no, no, no.
Don' t move him.
Don' t move him!
Oh, shit.
That had bad news written all over it.
You all right?
That was like the worst thing that could ever happen right there.
John can' t drive for shit.
I don' t know what happened.
I just remember we went in the air and the next thing I know I' m... just fucked.
Look at that cart.
Dude, you were hauling so much ass.
We' re here in Tokyo, and I feel like partying.
Hi.
I' m Party Boy.
Oh, can I try this?
Here we go.
It' s my party music.
You like it?
Kind of makes you wanna party, huh?
Kind of feel like partying right now.
Ready?
See, that' s what the big ones do but sometimes they don' t wanna...
Ow!
Fuck!
Don' t pull on it, man.
You can' t pry his mouth open.
It' s slowly getting weightless.
Is he over?
No, you' re twisting him!
You' re fuckin 'twisting him!
Oh, fuck!
He' s- He' s got my nipple, dude.
He' s got my fuckin 'nipple.
Wait, wait, wait, he' s gonna help you.
I know.
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
Don' t move.
Ow...
You little bastard!
Oh, look at the teeth marks.
Man.
I' m Bunny the Lifeguard and if any of these alligators try to ruin our swimming,
I' m gonna wrestle them down and probably have my way with them.
let the alligator take him and hopefully the alligator will release him.
Hi.
I' m Steve- O, and this is...
Oh, shit.
There' s no such thing as failure, Steve- O.
Take another step.
You got it.
One thing I know is good tightrope- walking.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
You' re good.
Put the chicken on him!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Oh, shit.
There you go.
Yeah, there you go.
Food, food, food, food, food.
Go back the other way.
No, keep going, Steve- O.
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!
Yeah!
Keep your head up, Steve- O!
Keep your head up!
Keep your head up!
- You guys, you gotta do this!
- Keep your head up!
Keep your butt up!
You got it!
All right, all right!
Keep your butt...
Put it in your ass and let him take it.
Come on.
Stick the bone up your ass.
And let him pull it out.
Get ready.
Stay there.
Don' t move.
It' il be over before you know it.
Don' t look!
Don' t look!
Steve- O, don' t look.
Don' t look!
Don' t look!
Don' t move!
Don' t move!
Hold still!
He' s going to the tail of it.
- Don' t look!
Don' t move!
I ran straight into a crocodile.
Oh, my God.
Why can' t you walk on a tightrope?
I don' t know.
I thought you' d do it.
Yeah.
I don' t know, man.
I' m sure I could learn but today... you know... today was my first try.
I' m Bam Margera, and my parents are dead asleep.
It' s 12: 42 right now and Phil has to be at work at 5: 00 in the morning.
So he' s trying to get a good night' s sleep and I' m gonna go wake his ass up.
I' m dying!
Holy shit!
Oh, my God, I' m opening the windows.
Gettin 'crazy over here.
Look at Phil' s tummy.
Oh, my God!
Phil, you gotta be up for 5: 00 in the morning tonight.
6: 00, I gotta be at work.
Yo, here he comes.
Here he comes.
Jesus Christ, Bam!
I almost broke my leg getting out of there!
There' s shit all over the goddamn...
How am I going to work now?
Go!
Jesus!
So... phisticated
What are you doing?
You know, I oughta arrest you right now with all that in your clothes.
What are you talking about?
Get this out of your pocket, man!
That' s all me!
- All of this!
- All of that!
That' s all me!
What is this bullshit?
- What is the meaning of this?
- Those are my bananas.
Don' t never come in here no more, man!
What are you...?
Get out!
And take the other stuff out of your pockets.
Get it all out!
That' s how you treat an old man?
Go!
An old man that steals, I can' t believe it.
Hey, man, what kind of games you play?
Get out!
Get out, man!
Goddamn it!
What is wrong with you?
Get out!
Man, quit playing!
I was Lon Chaney' s lover!
Go back and love him!
So, we' re gonna go to this hardware store... they sell toilets... and, uh, I' m gonna take a shit right in one of the toilets.
I' m gonna shit my pants before we get to that fuckin 'place.
Dave, fight it, man.
And I don' t even want to make a joke about it right now because I just want to hold it in.
Gotta poo?
Pretty much.
Really?
Yeah.
Really, man, don' t.
Do you want to ruin everything?
I swear to God, it' s...
Really?
That bad?
Yeah, like it' s a problem.
Is this the worst you ever had to go boom- boom?
No, no.
I shit my pants at the fair.
Oh, dude, he' s shitting right now.
Get outta the car!
Oh, get out, dude, get out!
No shit, get outta here!
Come on, man, get outta the fuckin 'car.
What do I do?
Did you shit?
Holy shit!
I' m taking a cab back to the hotel.
He just shat everywhere.
What' s wrong, man?
I had to sit there while he shat.
I need to go home right now.
It' s on my hand.
Is that a bolt?
We have very...
What the hell you doing?
What' s that?
What are you doing?
Oh, I' m sorry.
I' m almost done.
I hope you didn' t take a shit in that son of a bitch.
You take a shit in there you get to clean it out, pal.
That is disgusting, man.
What a fuckin '"Froot Loop."
Want to playback?
What the...?
Got him, dude.
Let' s see it.
That was so much...
- Look at me.
That' s a good one.
I' m Ehren McGhehey, and this is the mousetrap.
You' il be the cat, I' il be the mouse
Go, go, go, go!
All right!
Okay, that' s enough.
That' s enough!
I call it!
Time!
This isn' t gonna work.
It might.
Wh- What' s gonna happen here?
I don' t know but it' s not quite what' s going to be intended.
Raab' s putting a fucking tampon on.
That' s like a Courtney Love- sized maxipad.
Dudes, this is, like, worse than a hanging.
I' m Raab Himself and I' m a complete fucking idiot.
Oh, that' s funny.
It didn' t work.
Nope.
We gotta get another one, man.
Let' s do it again.
Hey, I' m Raab Himself, and this is Bungee Wedgie.
Is that your shitty ass, dude?
Look at the bloody, shitty underpants.
I went forward.
I can' t believe it.
All right, we' re here in the Valley today to do our own little riot control test.
This is George Hruska.
All right, George, uh, what do you do
All right, George, uh, what do you do and what are we doing here today?
Well, I' m vice president of operations with ALS Technologies.
We manufacture less- lethal ammunition.
We' re one of the top manufacturing companies in the United States and we' re going to shoot you with one of our projectiles.
It' s called the pen- prevent.
It' s a 40- gram, tail- stabilized bag.
It' il be traveling about 250 feet per second.
Is that lethal?
It' s considered less lethal.
I' m pretty much done with, so, uh...
We want to take every single precaution...
Right.... necessary to help protect your vital organs.
Where are my intestines?
Are they in that area?
I think so.
Awesome.
Ugh.
So you' re gonna take some practice shots?
Right.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
You know, this is nothing to be messing around with.
This is nothing for anybody to just be thrown into a. 12- gauge shotgun and- and, uh, you know, think they could take it.
You know, that' s one of the reasons I' m doing this is because I can do this in a controlled state.
Going hot.
That really hurt.
That looked like it hurt.
Oh, fuck, dude.
I caught that beanbag with my stomach?
That' s instinct.
You can' t teach that.
It hurts so much.
Like going from a prone position to standing is... ooh!
Hi.
I' m Wee Man, and this is a big cone.
Oh, my God, my brakes!
I can' t...
My brakes!
My brakes!
My brakes!
Stop me!
Stop me!
Stop me!
Oh!
- That was so fast!
- You all right?
Your brakes go out?
The whole thing doesn' t work.
Really?
Will you push me to the top?
I wanna do it again.
I could sure go for a Miller High Life.
Oh, you' re in so much trouble.
Kick her ass!
I' m about to get the shit kicked out of me by a girl.
Dude, I told you to keep up the left!
I' m not gonna agree!
... seven... eight... nine... ten.
That' s it.
And still champion.
Now pronounce her name.
Look at his bloody mouthpiece.
Oh, God, my jaw is, like, two inches to the left.
I seriously felt all right for a little bit until she punched me in the nose.
I knew she was fighting dirty.
One, two, three, four.
Oh, Jesus!
Go grab the dead kitty.
Dude, I' ve fuckin 'been in there before, dude.
I promise I will get my mom to say, "Fuck" by the end of this movie.
I' m Johnny Knoxville and we' re about to test my rocket skates.
Go!
All right, this is rocket skates, take two.
This one' s gonna be a little more powerful than the last one, so...
Why, these are different bottle rockets?
No, there' s just more of them.
Oh, fuck!
What' s wrong?
I fell and busted my ass, that' s what' s fuckin 'wrong.
That' s it.
No more rocket skates.
Ooh- ooh- ooh- ooh, ooh- ooh, ooh- ooh- ooh
God, this party sucks!
Hey, my man... wasabi, lots.
Wasabi.
Yeah!
So today, I' m gonna treat myself to some...
Blech!
Little circles.
God, chopsticks are so stupid.
That looks like a pretty good line, huh?
More.
Do another one.
Do another snooter.
I need a pick- me- up.
Look out!
God, get back here!
I said, "Get back here!"
Phil?
Phil?!
Phil?!
Hey, Phil!
Oh, my God.
Is this thing real?!
What thing?
This alligator?!
What?
Look, look, look!
Look around the corner!
What is that?
Don' t you even look?
Oh, my God!
It' s moving!
Look, Phil!
Oh, my God!
I don' t know what to do now.
Aren' t you scared to death?!
Ooh, it' s so gross that it' s even on the floor.
I' m leaving!
Where' s my keys?
I ever saw in my whole life!
- I' m leaving.
- Don' t leave.
Where the hell you going?
I' m leaving.
Phil, seriously, please.
How are we going to get this thing out of here!
I' m scared to death!
Oh, God!
Aw, man.
No!
No!
No, I' m not going near it!
God, where is it?
You don' t have it, do you?
He' s not there?
Seriously, is that real?!
I' m serious.
Is it real?
Is it real?
- Is it real?
How dare you bring that in this house!
Dude, dude.
Wait a minute!
Stop!
He kicked your ass, dude.
I didn' t even get you.
You got beat up by Wee Man.
Dude.
Let me see.
He didn' t even get you.
I didn' t even...
He didn' t even get you.
Let me see the back of your head.
It' il be all right.
I' m here with Eric Koston and Clyde Singleton and today I' m gonna 50/ 50 this rail, and... or try to.
So, this thing' s long.
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks for reminding me.
You got it.
I got it.
I got this.
Do you know, is he gonna go?
- Is he gonna go?
He' s gonna go somewhere.
He' s goin '.
Yeah, he' s goin ', yeah.
My impression of Johnny Knoxville.
Something like this.
Ow, my face!
I' m Johnny Knoxville and I' m gonna grind this rail.
Ready, set, go!
Yeah!
Yeah!
He made it all the way down.
I can' t believe he got that far.
I can' t believe he got that far.
You made it to the fucking bottom!
I can' t, I can' t...
This is the paper cuts.
I' m getting paper cuts between the webbings of my fingers and the webbings of my toes.
Hold it still.
There' s no good way to do it.
So just deal with it.
Take a... take a breath.
Oh, you can feel when it goes in.
Oh, this one works good.
Gimme the next one.
Do it.
Oh, yeah, opened up with a good one.
Did you hear that?
- Oh, that was my flesh!
If I do your hand, you' il forget about the pain in your foot.
That is a good point.
Take a deep breath.
Lance is trying...
Are you gonna puke?
- Watch Lance pass out.
- Lance is gonna puke!
From what, the pepperoni or the paper cuts?
Both?
The pepperoni?
Is he okay?
I don' t know.
Wait, is he all right?
- Hey, don' t knock over the beer.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I' m good.
Steve- O, if you want to do some more, do it.
I' m done.
Is everybody ready?
Yeah.
Okay.
That looks funny.
Now that sucked!
God, am I glad I came down to see what was going on in this room.
Wait a minute.
I know what my fortune is.
It' s partying.
This is...
Oh, honey, it' s been a while.
It' s a little too much.
Irving, you think you can do it?
You want a spot?
No, I got it.
I got it.
You got it?
If you need a spot, just give me a call.
Okay.
What' s the quickest you ever knocked anyone out?
I hold the California state record.
It' s like 18 seconds, including the- the 10- count.
I think you' re gonna break that today.
I' m Johnny Knoxville.
And I' m Butterbean.
Today, we' re gonna do a little boxing.
All right, you guys, touch gloves and come out fighting.
Get up!
Aw, man.
One more time.
This is the last time you' re kicking my ass.
One more time.
More pain.
That' s it.
You haven' t even hit me.
Hit me once, at least.
There you go.
He' s out.
Is Butterbean okay?
Look at this.
And by knockout in the first round... new champion, Butterbean!
Where we going, Knoxville?
The hospital.
What the hell are we doing that for?
Apparently, I have a big gash in my head and I think I' m a little concussed.
Are you giving me a shot?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Are you okay?
Mm- hmm.
- We got one more to go, buddy.
Then you' re a free man.
Thank you.
You' re gonna be not feeling great the next 24 hours.
- Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
You' il probably see me in two or three days.
Hey!
Goddamn it!
What are you doing?
Get off, man!
- What' s going on here?
Get off!
We' re in Okinawa and we' re about to go swim with some whale sharks but first... we need to go rub one out.
Well, I made the mistake of showing them what sea cucumbers do when they' re threatened and that is, you know, as soon as something touches them, these white threads come out of the end of it and, uh, Steve- O and Chris thought it was a great idea.
So, they' re out there trying to, uh...
Masturbate?... masturbate, yeah.
So, anyway, I- I apologize.
This is the...
With a simple shave of the razor
Steve- O easily disguises himself... to fool the whale sharks into thinking he' s a harmless young boy.
I am pretty nervous about my wiener around that whale shark; I really am.
Now, the best way to think of the whale sharks they' re like big puppy dogs.
Sometimes puppies bite.
Puppies, they have little teeth.
They have little teeth.
You' re gonna get a gummer.
All right.
So, it' s kinda like being with a gal with no teeth.
- Kind of, yes.
So right below in these waters, 30- foot whale sharks are waiting to eat these freakin 'shrimp out of our crotches.
Okay.
Oh, they kind of... they pinch.
Are these alive?
They don' t feel good on the way...
You' re part of this.
Look at this shrimp.
I guess I don' t really have any last words.
I' m just gonna kill myself once I lose my wiener.
My penis is really small now.
I can' t really look cool right now.
I' m Johnny Knoxville.
This is the tidal wave.
How' d it look?
It looked good.
You just got... creamed.
I don' t even, like, pick a tattoo, like... unless I' m pretty sure that people are gonna laugh every time they see it.
Oh, my God, dude.
Like, how do you perform the fuckin 'world' s dumbest tattoo?
Fuck, man, at least I don' t have to look at it, right?
My name is Henry Rollins and this is...
This is really gonna fuck you up!
Prissy motherfucker!
It' s a total smiley face, dude.
I just fully got a haircut just, like, a week ago.
You' re about to get many more.
Yeah, me, too.
I am not doing it.
Look at Ehren.
Oh, shit!
So, we' re finding it a little bit chilly in Japan.
We' re gonna warm ourselves up with some fireworks.
Let' s go, dude.
Roll back there, just a bit.
This is a bad angle.
Like, an ember fell right in my corn hole, dude.
All right, Johnny' s double- knotting it.
Double knot it, but gently.
You may think this next stunt is impossible.
You gotta squat a little, Pontius.
Is Chris' s dick shorter or...
Yeah, it' s a little shorter.
Keep it in!
Hold it!
It almost hit Loomis in the face.
Goddamn, this is the...
Mother!
What a dumb- ass idea.
I' m surrounded by cacti.
For fuck' s sake.
It' s cactus.
Whatever it is, it hurts.
You wanna get up and cross?
This is the yellow snow cone.
Pack it in there nice and tight.
It might take a second.
Oh!
There we go.
I' m not even worried about the pee.
I' m just worried about...
Come on, you' re missing the cone, dude!
You' re missing the cone!
You better eat that whole thing, too.
You gotta go eat that spot, too.
Enjoy the snow cone.
Aw, you just wasted a whole bunch!
Dude, get that whole mouthful right there.
Keep going!
Keep going!
- Come on, it' s your pee.
Oh, come on.
It' s so cold.
Swallow it!
Oh, God.
Eat it!
Swallow it!
- Oh, no, no.
I' m doing it!
Don' t look at it.
Dude, it' s dripping out the bottom.
Will you catch that, what' s dripping out the bottom?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, that was bad.
That sucked!
Kick yourself in the head, Wee Man.
What are you doing?
Are you starting to lose your mind on that shit?
Bam, stop it!
Now, you' re getting crazy on this shit.
"Ape!"
He' s starting to lose it!
Jesus Christ!
Ape, I need toilet paper!
Okay, this is called the...
When people tee off when they' re coming down with their swing, we' re gonna blow these air horns.
Here she goes again.
No.
She still hit it pretty good.
What' d I tell you?
That I' d come over here and kick your ass.
Here, you lost your club.
Didn' t I tell you I was going to come over here and kick your ass for that?
But...
I' m sorry.
I got bursitis.
- You got bursitis?
So, that means you gotta play with a horn?
It helps.
I' il give you something to play with, pal.
It won' t happen again.
- Oh, fuck!
Get down!
Oh, shit!
Get down, get down.
Wait.
Oh, these things are scary.
I' m Bam Margera.
I' m Johnny Knoxville.
And we' re gonna be burglars today.
Oh, God!
Fuck!
Dude, I told you not to fall off the damn beam.
Turn around!
Fuck!
Aw, holy fuck!
Idiot!
Go!
Oh, fuck!
You all right?
I' m good.
What' d you think happened right there?
It' s embarrassing.
I was barely halfway through the ceiling and you were already out the door.
You' re a real sprinter.
Guys in masks, I' m out.
I don' t play.
Is there any actual, like, real reason... why anyone would shove something up their ass like this?
I' m claiming predictions for this event.
Where' s Ryan?
Are you going to make them?
Number one, it' s not getting in there.
Number two, even if it does, it' s not staying in there.
Definitely no sitting down happening.
Number three, there' s no way they' re gonna believe that this is true.
So, you' re saying it' s...
You don' t want it to happen that much.
No, I really do.
This is our original talent for this piece, by the way.
I' ve ever seen you duck out on.
Oh, man, I am so glad I turned this idea down.
I' m so glad.
Oh, yeah.
I' il probably use all of this before the end of the segment.
Uh... what else we got?
A condom.
Thank you.
And, um, a little toy car.
Blue, it' s my favorite color.
Let me see that.
Dangle it.
Look at the reservoir tip.
Now I' m lubing up...
I can' t see the car.... the little toy car, because I' m going to put it in my butt.
Be comfortable.
Hey, Ed' s here for rescuing, dude.
You' re here for making it a problem.
All right, you' re gonna watch this?
You' re making me uncomfortable.
I gotta get another job.
Lube up your corn hole.
I' m spackling.
Spackling.
Heart rate' s going up for sure!
Oh, dude, it hurts.
Your adrenaline' s flowing, isn' t it?
There' s no getting around it, it fucking hurts like hell.
Come on in, Manny.
You' re just in time, Manny.
Oh, Manny... tell me I' m a man.
Man, it feels so goddamn gross.
This is insane, man.
This is... this is totally insane.
- It' s in.
- It' s in, dude.
- It' s in?
- Yeah.
- Let' s see.
I feel like I have to shit my ass.
Is there anything intact?
You said that you didn' t want to do it because your dad would disown you?
Well, I mean, it wasn' t that.
You drank wine off of a dude' s ass crack.
My dad never saw that.
I never told him that... you know.
I was gonna do this and I was like, "Dad"...
I was, like, "Dad, we' re going hard these days and there' s some ideas floating around."
I just mentioned the car in the butt.
My dad, like... the only time in my life
I ever heard my dad, like...
You know, it' s like when your parents say,
like, that hurts so much more, you know?
Fucking rad.
Look at him walk.
John' s gonna win, dude.
I' m not too excited about this skit.
It' s not my favorite I' ve ever done, because there' s a toy car in my butt but this is the...
I think I need an X ray.
Yes?
How you doing?
Pretty good.
I' m Ryan, and this is...
What can I do for you?
I was partying last night with some frat guys.
I must have fallen down or broken something, because I haven' t been able to walk right since.
We' re gonna take X ray now, to be sure.
Okay.
- Take one of those.
- Oh, okay.
This is comfy.
Don' t move.
What' s that?
I have no idea.
That' s not part of you.
That' s something extra.
I would' ve known if I ate that.
You wouldn' t be able to swallow that.
That is a car toy.
Well, how did a car toy get there?
Maybe you stuck it up your ass.
I didn' t stick anything up my ass.
Have you ever seen anything like that?
No, I never seen that in there.
I' ve seen a toy car all over but never in somebody' s rectum.
You can' t get it out?
I' m a physician, but I practice this, X ray only.
You think maybe I can just, you know, poop it out?
You won' t be able to poop it out.
In fact, it will hurt you.
I fact, I don' t think it' s even good for you that you poop it out.
What will happen if you take Ex- Lax?
No, if he takes Ex- lax, well, he gets a lot of diarrhea but no car.
I appreciate it.
Thank you for taking care of me.
He' s alive.
Oh, Johnny Knoxville, he made it!
Oh, there is a God.
Oh, please.
I thought it would never...
This is the end!
Oh, thank you, Jesus!
- Let' s see it!
Let' s see it!
Oh, fuck!... Give me a moment
You hide your looks behind these scars
- In hybrid moments - Bam?
Go!
Whose dick do I gotta suck to get some explosions around here?
He' s got a boner.
Oh, fuck!
It' s a man.
Gator wrestling.
For fuck' s sake, come here!
Hurry up.
Hurry!
We wanted to see if you would run here with a car up your ass.
Oh, I ain' t runnin 'anywhere.
It' s scary enough to walk.
You' re nice.
Want to come over for dinner?
Oh, that' s okay.
You know how to operate it now?
Yeah, I think so.
- I need help.
If you' re gonna be dumb, you gotta be tough...
What did I say?
Fuck.
I didn' t say the "F" word.
Yeah, you did.
You said, "Fuck."
- Don' t worry, we' il bleep it.
Can we cut that out?... And I had dudes with badges frisk me...
I took advice no fool would take...
They don' t have a tail?
No!
Show him the X ray.
When you get knocked down, you gotta get back up...
Aw, fuck!
The next time, we can do...
Son of Jackass.
Son...
Yeah, dude.
You better get married soon.
You' re starting to look old.
My dad has been saying that to me since I was 15... because nice Greek girls are supposed to do three things in life.
Marry Greek boys, make Greek babies, and feed everyone... until the day we die.
When I was growing up, I knew I was different.
The other girls were blond and delicate.
And I was a swarthy 6- year- old with sideburns.
I so badly wanted to be like the popular girls... all sitting together, talking... eating their Wonder Bread sandwiches.
What' s that?
It' s moussaka.
Moose ka- ka?
And while the pretty girls got to go to Brownies...
I had to go to Greek school.
At Greek school, I learned valuable lessons like:
"If Nick has one goat and Maria has nine, how soon will they marry?"
My mom was always cooking foods filled with warmth and wisdom... and never forgetting that side dish of steaming- hot guilt.
Niko, don' t play with the food.
When I was your age, we didn' t have food.
- What?
Why do I have to go to Greek school?
When you get married, don' t you want to be able to write your mother- in- law a letter?
Niko, come on, eat!
We lived in a normal, middle- class Chicago neighborhood of tasteful, modest homes.
Our house, however, was modeled after the Parthenon... complete with Corinthian columns, and guarded by statues of the gods.
In case the neighbors had any doubts about our heritage... they could just check out our subtle tribute to the Greek flag.
My dad believed in only two things... that Greeks should educate non- Greeks about being Greek... and that any ailment, from psoriasis to poison ivy, could be cured with Windex.
Six years later, I was 12.
Athena, my older, perfect sister, was 15.
And my brother, Nick, was 11.
"the great civilization, the Greeks."
Now, name three things the Greeks did first.
Astronomy, philosophy, and democracy.
Bravo!
Very good.
Now, give me a word... any word... and I show you, how the root of that word... is Greek.
How about "arachnophobia"?
"Arachna," that comes from the Greek word for spider... and "phobia" is a phobia, it means "fear."
Okay, Mr. Portokalos, how about the word "kimono"?
- "Kimono."
- Good one.
Kimono, kimono.
"cheimonas," which means "winter."
So, what do you wear in the wintertime... to stay warm?
You see, "robe," "kimono." There you go.
- Bye- bye.
Toula!
You should be proud to be Greek.
A couple more years went by... and my dad brought his mother from Greece to live with us... because we weren' t weird enough.
- Mama, please!
The Greeks and the Turks friends now.
We told my grandma the war was over... but she still slept with a knife under her pillow.
Nice Greek girls who don' t find a husband work in the family restaurant.
So, here I am, day after day, year after year.
My God.
Fotoula!
You closed last night, you' re opening this morning?
I have no life.
Fotoula, you talk to me sometime.
Ma, you' re gonna make me swallow my tongue.
Toula!
What' s up?
No, my Nikki.
She was supposed to come over to curl my hairs.
Nick, did you check the meat before you signed for it?
- Dad checked it.
- It better be fresh.
My brother has two jobs, to cook and to marry a Greek virgin.
Voula, have something to eat before you go to work.
If nagging was an Olympic sport, my Aunt Voula would have a gold medal.
Taki, you couldn' t wait for me?
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry.
Don' t "sorry" me.
Rash.
- Put some Windex on it.
- Oh, Gus, please.
This works.
Last night, my toe was as big as my face.
Why you not wait for me?
He wants to talk.
Anyway, I tell her...
- I will send her to Greece to find somebody.
- She' s not too old.
She' s okay.
- She won' t go.
- She won' t go?
It' s like she don' t want to get married.
Go in there.
My sister married young and became a Greek baby- breeding machine.
Just a quick coffee.
I have to drop the boys off at hockey and then I got to get to the Jewel.
- Bread?
Then the priest is coming to bless the new house, so I have to make diples.
Can you believe it?
Put that back for me.
You dropped my tzatziki.
- Nikki, shut up.
My cousins have two volumes, loud and louder.... your big- ass girlfriend.
Hey, Toula.
Hi, everybody.
Nikki, how come you didn' t come to curl my hair this morning?
Ma, I had to drop Dimo at work.
Now I got to go open the travel agency, because some jack- off... and his big- ass girlfriend are too busy.
Tell her I open up the cleaners every day.
It' s time she does something for a change.
You know who' s there this morning?
- My husband.
You' re lazy.
You and your big- ass girlfriend do nothing.
Did somebody sit on your hair?
Ma.
Let' s go.
- Athena, when did you come?
Bye, Ma.
You' re going?
I' m going to the Jewel.
I' il get you some pantyhose.
No queen size.
No more fun and games.
Toula, what' s this?
Toula, what is this?
- I don' t know.
- Mama.
Now don' t forget, I need the plates and...
Go.
All right, we' re gonna go.
- I wanna drive.
Just watch.
- To me, she looks okay.
- Okay?
What okay?
Look.
Athena is married with three children.
And I' il get married, Pops, I promise.
You have plenty of time, Niko.
And you' il always have Toula to run the restaurant.
Toula will never leave you.
I wish I had a different life.
I wish I was braver and prettier... or just happy.
But it' s useless to dream, because nothing ever changes.
- Hey, what' s going on?
- Good.
- Oh, good.
- Cool place.
- Yeah, it' s adorable.
Look at that.
That could have been you with that arm around her.
You set me up with her already.
- Hanson' s picnic.
No, that was Pamela.
They look the same.
Well, maybe.
So, you want me to set you up?
They' re all the same, Mike.
- Hi.
Sorry, my brain stopped.
You ever have one of those days, when it' s going along and then stops?
Here I am, standing here, your own private Greek statue.
- Could I get some more coffee, please?
Thank you.
All right, let' s go.
- I got a class.
I love the spice on these potatoes.
Come on.
Keep the change.
For the new menu?
- Where did you get that?
- I drew it, Dad.
Dad, I' ve been going through our inventory... and I' ve noticed that we' ve been doing a lot of unnecessary ordering.
I' ve been thinking that maybe we should update our system.
We could get a computer.
I don' t know if you remember, but I got all A' s in Computers.
But there' s a lot of new stuff to learn now... so, if you want, I could go to college and take a few courses.
Why you want to leave me?
I' m not leaving you.
Don' t you want me to do something with my life?
Make babies!
You look so old!
Come on.
I know what you want.
You want to learn.
I know, you' re from my side.
Don' t you worry.
I' m gonna talk to him.
Dad is so stubborn.
What he says goes.
"The man is the head of the house."
Let me tell you something, Toula.
The man is the head, but the woman is the neck.
And she can turn the head any way she wants.
Don' t cry.
Come on.
And what is wrong with Toula going to school downtown?
They use drugs downtown.
Are you saying that Toula will get involved with drugs?
"Take this bag down to the bus depot," and she' il do it.
She' s not stupid.
She' s smart.
I know she' s smart, so what for she needs more school?
She' s smart enough for a girl.
You think you' re smarter than me?
No, I mean, you know...
What do you mean?
I run the restaurant, I cook, I clean...
I wash for you, and I raised three kids... and I teach Sunday school.
You know, it' s lucky for me I have you to tie my shoes.
Maria...
You know I' ve been learning about computers?
There' s this course, a seminar.
It' s all about computers and tourism.
There are all the latest applications and programs.
I could apply it here, Thia.
And your business would double or triple.
You could be with Thio more, and you could take a vacation.
But, Thia, would you hire me?
Of course.
My God!
We must let Kosta think this was his idea, that he came up with it.
- I know what to do.
Do you want my help?
Tell me what to say, but don' t tell me what to say.
- That' s good.
How is business?
What' s the matter?
What happened?
Do you need money?
No, what she means is that, with the two businesses, she suffers.
She has to be at the travel agency alone, all day... because everybody else needs to be working at the big dry- cleaning store.
I make Taki go to the dry- cleaner store... and now I have no time with him.
So, send Angelo or Nikki... to the travel agency, you be with Taki at the dry cleaner.
- That would be good.
- That would be no good.
Because... neither Angelo nor Nikki know how to use the computer.
Computer?
I have your answer.
Toula will go to the travel agency... and you send Nikki here to work for us.
I can' t believe this.
You see, a man...
You' re just so smart, I love you.
Hello, Mrs. Christakis.
Hold again, please.
Hi, British Airways.
I' m gonna need a hard tick on that one.
Reading, Alpha, Bravo, Foxtrot, Charlie.
Hi, Mrs. Christakis, your tickets are now in the mail... under "Doreen Christakis."
Okay, thank you, bye- bye.
I got it.
Did you lose this?
Oh, Mrs. White.
You find my mama again.
You know, she come from Greece, the country I come from, too.
For God' s sake, I know.
Listen, keep your mother off my lawn... out of my basement and away from my roof.
Mrs. White, come on.
Give me a word, any word... and I' il show you that the root of that word... is Greek.
Look who' s back again.
Very good.
Toula, there are two kinds of people...
Okay.
Yes, we know.
What' s the matter with her?
May I help you?
What are you doing?
Right.
Sure.
I could reserve the seat for you.
That would be no problem.
Hi.
Did you wanna see some brochures?
Found them.
Yeah.
I was swept off of my feet by your very cool opening line of "hi."
So, Toula?
lan.
lan Miller.
Toula Porkipakos?
Portokalos.
- All right, then.
Was that a biker fight or a nose job?
Yeah.
No, really.
You don' t wanna know.
If I' d survived an old- lady ass- kicking, I' d brag about it.
Ouch!
- You want to have dinner with me?
- Yeah.
Actually, I wasn' t in education first, I was prelaw.
My dad' s a lawyer and my grandfather is a lawyer and... it just wasn' t for me, so I picked a new major.
The parents weren' t too pleased, you know?
I think it takes a pretty strong person to do that.
Well, you know everything about me, then...
I' m a pretty strong, vegetarian teacher... over at Lincoln Park.
I don' t know anything about you, except you' re Greek.
Hey... would you like to go have Greek food?
No, that' s okay.
No, listen.
I know this really great place, you probably know it, Zorba' s something.
Anyway, I' d like to take you there, if you' d like to go.
- I don' t wanna go there.
Why not?
Dancing Zorba' s.
Dancing Zorba' s.
My family owns that restaurant.
Really?
I remember you.
You' re that waitress.
Seating hostess, actually.
I remember you.
And...
I don' t remember Frump Girl, but I remember you.
Okay, no Greek.
Tomorrow night?
Okay.
Where are you going?
I' m taking a pottery class.
The Greeks invented pottery.
So, it was just me, all alone... up in the mountains in this cottage, with my parents, all summer.
Well, don' t all your cousins go up, too?
I only have two cousins.
They live in Wisconsin.
- You only have two cousins?
- How many do you have?
Well, who else?
Didn' t you have brothers and sisters?
What are your parents like?
Well...
Okay, Christmas.
What do you do for Christmas with your family?
My mom makes roast lamb.
- No.
And...
- I' m Greek, right?
So what happens is my dad and my uncles... fight over who gets to eat the lamb brain.
And them my Aunt Voula forks the eyeball, and chases me around... trying to make me eat it, because it' il make me smart.
You have two cousins.
Just 27 first cousins, alone.
And my whole family is big and loud... and everybody' s always in each other' s lives and business.
You never have a minute alone to just think, because we' re always together eating.
The only other people we know are Greeks... because Greeks marry Greeks, to breed more Greeks... to be loud, breeding, Greek eaters.
- Wow.
No one in my family has ever gone out with a non- Greek before.
No one.
God, you' re just, you know, wonderful.
So...
What' s to work out?
We' re not a different species.
Yes, we come from different backgrounds... and, hey, here' s some news about my life, to this point.
It' s boring.
Then I met you... and you' re interesting, and you' re beautiful and fun.
You' ve got a weird family.
Who doesn' t?
I just want to spend some time with you.
Did you say I' m beautiful?
Which house is yours?
This is good, actually.
- Can you stop?
Just stop.
Thanks.
Good night.
Good night.
- Okay, good night.
No, don' t go.
Good night.
Don' t go.
Happy again today, Toula?
Yeah.
Now every time I see you, you have a great big smile.
- Hey, Niko.
- Where' d you go?
- Nowhere.
- Nothing.
- Who did you see?
- No one.
Wait a minute, Niko, I put them in your room.
Toula, how was your class?
My pottery class?
- It' s great.
- Good.
No.
What is going on?
Mr. Pottery Class, nice to meet you.
lan, this is my cousin, Nikki.
Hello!
Yeah, well...
I' m the least of your worries.
Last night, Vicki Pavalopolis saw you sucking the lips... off his head, in the Denny' s parking lot.
She told her ma, who told my ma, who told your ma...
You' re busted.
You sneak around, all over Chicago... but you never come here to ask me, can you date my daughter.
I' m sorry, but to ask you if I can date your daughter...
I am the head of this house!
Okay, may I please date your daughter?
No!
- See you tomorrow.
Didn' t I say it' s a mistake... to educate women?
But nobody listened to me.
Now we have a boyfriend in the house.
Is he a nice Greek boy?
No Greek!
A xeno!
A xeno with a big long hairs...
- Kosta.
I' m sorry I lied to you.
Okay, Toula... maybe you are having a little romance.
But end it now.
I love him.
Toula, eat something... please.
Your father has a friend for dinner.
Where are we?
My apartment.
You wanna go up?
Don' t worry, they' re gonna love you.
"Toula." Now that' s not a name you hear every day.
Does it mean anything in your language?
Well, my Greek name, Fotoula, means "Light of God."
Who would like a coffee?
So, you' re Greek then?
Portokalos.
In Greek, it means "orange."
Like an orange that you eat, the one with the peel, not the color.
Yeah, it' s really Greek.
Rodney, didn' t you once have a Greek receptionist?
No, Harriet, she was...
- Just a minute.
- No, she was Armenian.
- Is Armenia close to Greece?
- What was she?
- Who?
My secretary, for heaven' s sake.
Everyone like cheesecake?
- That' s right, dear.
She was Guatemalan.
I love you.
I love you.
I don' t really know how to say this.
What?
Will you marry me?
Enough.
What?
Sit down.
Kosta... they love each other.
How can she do this to me?
She didn' t do this to you or to me.
They fell in love.
Is he a good boy?
I don' t know.
Is he from a good family?
I don' t know.
Is he respectful?
I don' t know... because nobody talks to me about nothing no more.
A respectful boy would come here and ask for my permission.
Why is she doing this to me?
Excuse me.
Try not to be too loud.
- Are you okay?
- Can we go to Vegas?
What?
Can we go to Niagara Falls or Fiji...
Sure.
Okay, let' s go.
Come here.
What' s the matter?
I just feel like we can' t get married, not like this.
It' s like... when I' m with you...
I am so happy... but my family is so unhappy.
And our wedding should be this joyous thing.
But it won' t be for them, because it can' t be in our church.
So, let' s just go somewhere.
Hey, I love you.
Why?
Why do you love me?
Because I came alive when I met you.
But my family...
You' re a part of your family... and I' il do anything... whatever it takes, to get them to accept me.
We' re not going to skulk off and get married... as if we' re ashamed of ourselves.
Okay.
- Let' s just skulk off somewhere...
Do it for Toula, come on.
He wants to get married in the church.
- Go!
- All right.
So, you' re going to be baptized tomorrow?
It' s your lucky day... to be baptized in the Greek Orthodox Church.
Nikki' s going to be your godmother.
You know... the word "baptism"... comes from the Greek word "baftisia."
Are you kidding?
"Right, you' re so not worth this."
Yes, you are.
I' m Greek, now.
Thank you so much.
So, for "Happy Easter," we say "Khristos Anesti."
Then the other person says back, "Alithos Anesti."
So if you want to say "Happy Easter," you go, "Khristos Anesti." So try it.
Mr. Portokalos, Khristos Anesti.
- He likes you.
- Yes?
I told you to watch the boys.
They' il be fine with the video games.
- I can' t do anything right.
- You' re in trouble when I tell my sister.
- Tell me what?
Where is he?
Toula, you' re engaged!
We never think it would happen for you.
- Taki, didn' t we say that?
- Is this him?
Everyone, this is lan.
lan!
- You like that dance?
Okay, Jennie has something she wants to ask you.
- No, she doesn' t.
Jennie, just ask me.
Does he have any brothers?
I' ve got to tell you, I' ve never seen my sister so happy.
If you hurt her, I' il kill you and make it look like an accident.
Jesus, look at your face.
It' s just a joke.
Good one.
No, the good one is, "I' ve got a gun."
Yeah, I' ve got a gun... and I swear, I' il jam it up your...
lan, I got you again!
- Here, eat some rice.
- I don' t want any rice, I' m good.
I could snap you like a chicken!
I' il lighten you when I take out your kidneys.
- Hey, Angelo.
- Hey, lan, we' re going to kill you!
Let me touch your hair.
When you come to my house and I cook for you?
- Okay.
- Thia, that might be a problem.
I' m the best cook in the family.
Tell him.
- I did, didn' t I?
Okay, then.
It' s just...
lan is a vegetarian.
He doesn' t eat meat.
No, he doesn' t eat meat.
What do you mean, "He don' t eat no meat"?
Come.
Come and dance.
It' s delicious.
We took a look at my calendar, our calendar... to set a day for the big day... sometime at the end of October, mid- November?
- Sometime in there, yeah.
- Wonderful.
The Club?
The North Shore Country Club, for the wedding, of course.
We' re going to get married in Toula' s church... because we' re not very religious, and her family is.
Show them the brochure.
My cousin Nikki made me this.
This is from her prom.
Tell them about, we got this great big hall...
- What' s it called, for the reception?
It' s not really a palace.
This is a brochure.
That Parthenon backdrop is optional.
They' re cousins!
Dad, the thing is that we just want to keep it small.
It' s like you' d rather go bankrupt than insult anyone from the church.
I come to this country with $8 in my pocket... to make all this for you.
And... who knows how long I' m going to be alive?
Okay, come on.
No more punching Thio Niko' s nads, okay?
Look at you, how big you are!
- Did she spit on him?
Yeah, for good luck.
Wait for me.
Where did you get that?
Remember?
Okay, Niko.
- No, I already ate.
- Okay, I' il make you something.
Okay.
Now, Toula, we have to have Tommy Kasimatis.
Hey, let me help you with those.
- What is wrong with Tommy Kasimatis?
- Who cares?
- Why are you being so weird?
- You' re weird when you' re pregnant.
How do you say "thank you" in Greek?
You got it.
- Yeah?
Listen, I got the greatest connection for your invitations.
No, we' re gonna order our own invitations, okay?
I don' t want something your cash- only connection gets... that falls off of a truck.
- Yeah, but they come through, right?
- For God' s sake, let the man talk.
- Why are you always so stubborn?
Girls, I ordered the invitations two weeks ago.
- I' il go get them.
Wait till you see them.
My parents' names are Rodney and Harriet.
"Rodney and Harry"?
I didn' t notice, so I bet they won' t.
Wait.
I have got the biggest scoop.
Look at the earrings I have found that match the bridesmaids' dresses.
I remembered.
We have a customer at the dry cleaner' s... who is a custom jewelry designer.
So, I showed her the fabric.
Wait, what do these match?
Not that fabric you showed me last week.
- I said I' d think about it.
That' s just because... you couldn' t visualize it.
- You' re so beautiful!
That' s classy.
Look.
I' m gonna start slowly, you know.
Do a couple of night courses.
I just wanted to learn more about painting and art and stuff, so...
Yeah, you started it.
You wanted to do something else... and you did it.
Hey, Toula... don' t let your past dictate who you are... but let it be part of who you will become.
Yeah.
That Dear Abby, she really knows what she' s talking about.
- Hi, Mom, it' s me.
All right, lan is going to pick me up... and then we' il get his parents, and then we' re gonna be there in one hour.
- Is everything okay?
- I peel the potatoes.
Why are you peeling potatoes?
I know, but we need more.
How much are you cooking?
It' s a lot of people.
- There' s three of them.
- And us.
- Then that makes seven.
- And the family.
You invited the whole family?
Of course.
Ma, I said, "Come for a quiet dinner, and meet my parents."
- Maria.
- I got to go, Taki' s here.
Bye.
I' m coming.
Look at this.
Bravo!
They are here!
Welcome to my home.
Over here is my brother, Ted... and his wife, Melissa, and their children, Anita, Diane, and Nick.
Over here, my brother, Tommy, his wife, Angie... and their children, Anita, Diane, and Nick.
And here, my brother, George, that' s his wife, Frieda... and their children, Anita, Diane, and Nick.
Taki, Sophie, Carrie, Nick, Nick, Nick...
Nikki... and I am Gus.
Excuse me.
Hello.
I am Maria Portokalos... and welcome to our home.
Thank you.
It' s a bundt.
- A "bundt"?
- Bundt.
It' s a cake!
Thank you very much.
These are some of my cousins.
Hey, lan, good to see you, man.
Listen, I really think you should say, "Eho tria arhidia."
Everybody will really like it.
That' s good, you' ve got it.
- Why?
Yeah, why?
Angelo, how do you say, "Everyone, let' s go in the house"?
See that?
You like them?
I make them.
Go, sit down.
Sit.
Come.
- Sit down.
All my life...
Always a lump.
From the hormones, it started to grow.
So, I go to the doctor, and he did the... the bios...
Inside the lump, he found teeth... and a spinal cord.
Spanakopita!
- I love it when you speak in Greek.
Thank you.
It' s delicious.
Some Greek meat, very good.
And now, the bundt cake.
You tried.
We all nice to them, you see it.
And they look at us like we' re from the zoo.
This no work, Maria.
They different people.
So dry.
That family is like a piece of toast.
No honey, no jam, just dry.
My daughter... gonna marry lan Miller.
A xeno with a toast family.
I never think this can happen to us.
Oh, no, they don' t like.
They like themselves, all dry and cracking.
He' s got to be Greek Orthodox, so...
I can' t ask you to be my best man, although, technically, you are.
You were gonna ask me to be your best man?
I am touched.
I had no idea you had so few friends.
Just get me a little badge that says "best man" or something like that.
No offence, but this girl' s family' s got you by the short ones.
They say "jump," and you pull out the trampoline.
Okay.
Toula' s got a lot of cousins.
Fix you up.
Yeah, that' s gonna happen.
What is wrong?
Is my marriage killing Dad?
Toula, your father is your father.
He just wants you to be happy.
But I am happy.
Listen to me.
My village saw many wars...
Turkish, German... they all made a mess.
And my mother, she said:
"We' re lucky to be alive."
And I thought, "We' re not lucky to be alive.
"where we should live, what we should eat."
And then, I see you.
And I see Athena and Niko.
We came here for you.
So you could live.
I gave you life, so that you could live it.
Ma, the band needs to be picked up at the airport.
Surprise!
Wait, what is that?
My God!
Where did everybody go?
It is a mosquito bite.
Hello, ladies, fresh baklava.
- Get out of here.
Give me the camera.
Help me.
No boys allowed!
Niko, let' s go.
- Dad, is that my tux?
- No, this one.
Okay.
Hey, what' s that thing?
It' s a mosquito bite.
I' ve got the cover- up.
Bravo!
You' re all nuts.
We' ve got another one.
You are supposed to get changed at my house.
Get out.
Let me pop it!
There she is.
Toula, I want to talk to you.
Now?
This is a very special night for you.
One more, one big one, hold on.
Listen, Toula.
On my wedding night... my mother, she said to me:
"but we are tigers in the bedroom."
Please, let that be the end of your speech.
The photographer' s here.
- I' m all right.
Oh, Maria!
She' s ready!
My God!
How are we supposed to know what' s going on?
Rodney!
What?
We take our first steps... as husband and wife.
Are you ready?
I' m ready.
- Where are you?
- Yes!
Wipe, wipe off.
- Is that better?
Who did your makeup?
Your aunts?
Drag queens could get a few tips from those aunts.
I' m just covered!
Come on, help me with the veil.
- Yeah, you got it.
Do we have to go in?
Let' s go in.
Thank God.
What?
I woke up with this huge zit this morning.
- Where?
- There.
- I had a huge zit this morning.
- Yeah.
Well, it was right here.
But it' s gone.
I put some Windex on it.
Welcome to the Portokalos family.
And welcome... the Miller family.
I was thinking, last night... the night before... my daughter was going to marry lan Miller... that the root of the word "miller"... is a Greek word.
And "miller" come from... the Greek word milo... which is mean "apple."
As many of you know... our name Portokalos... is come from the Greek word portokali... which means "orange."
So, okay... here tonight... we have apple and orange.
Yes, we are all fruit.
My wife and me, we have a gift.
The parents give a gift.
Here.
My God!
They bought us a house.
I love you, too.
Thia Voula, we' re going to dance.
- Okay.
Athena, I' m going to be a painter.
Good.
You can start with our fence.
This is just a really nice wedding.
We' re going to dance now.
Come on.
I' il need a little more ouzo before I do that.
Bottoms up.
Come on, Kosta.
All right.
Yia sou, lan.
Sometimes, I' m afraid that it didn' t happen.
I' m scared I' il wake up and still be buttering garlic bread... waiting for my life to start.
It did!
And I figured out some stuff.
My family is big and loud... but they' re my family.
We fight and we laugh.
And yes, we roast lamb on a spit in the front yard.
And wherever I go, whatever I do... they will always be there.
So, lan and I moved into the house my parents bought us.
A minute later, I was pregnant.
And six years later, it was our daughter' s turn to go to Greek school.
Mom, I want to go to Brownies.
You can marry anybody you want.
Thanks, baby.
What' s that mean?
"Let' s go."
- Let' s go.
- That' s pretty good.
- Hi, Dad.
SubRip by TraceR
You know who would be perfect to direct this... and it kills me to say it, because I don' t relish the idea of working with him...
- but... my ex- husband.
Val' s perfect.
He' s perfect, given this material.
This is his kinda story.
Look, I love Val.
But with all due respect...
- he' s a raving, incompetent psychotic.
- He' s not incompetent.
They should lock him up and throw away the key.
Don' t take that the wrong way.
We' re gonna wind up $20 million over budget, and maybe no picture to boot.
I did a picture with him when I was at Firestone.
- He didn' t even finish the movie.
- I was there at Firestone.
- He had a nervous breakdown.
- He was under a lot of stress.
We had just broken up...
Honey, he was fired off a picture here at Galaxie just before I took over.
- They said his demands were outrageous.
- He' s a perfectionist.
- The light had to be perfect.
The sun had to be just right.
He demanded that they replace the leading lady.
He wanted to reshoot the dailies every other day.
He fired the cameraman.
Finally, he came down with shingles.
They shut down the picture and found another director to finish it...
You- You don' t have to tell me about that.
I was married to him at the time.
- You should remember.
- That was ten years ago, Hal.
His best pictures were ten years ago.
Then he became a real artiste.
Look, look.
I am the last person to defend that craziness... because it drove me nuts.
But Val cares about movies, and he was born to do this material.
- Ellie, what are we discussing here?
- Shingles, headaches.
Why open a can of worms?
- But he' s mellowed.
Who better to direct this?
- The streets of New York are in his marrow.
- Let me just say this:
Ruth.
- Yes, Ruth.
- No way!
God!
What about him?
He' s great.
I know we could get him.
We can put our foot on his neck.
Martin Ruth.
Val hasn' t worked in a lot of years.
We could make a good deal.
- All you have to do is watch him like a hawk.
- We' re gonna lose...
We' re gonna lose a lot more with Val.
I think he' s the ideal director for this project.
- But we' re not gonna use him.
Who needs trouble?
- Right.
Besides, what makes you think he' d want to work with us, given all the personal baggage?
I' m told that he' s in no position to be fussy.
- I can' t stand it here.
What the hell am I doing in Canada?
Lori, they got moose up here.
Moose.
Are moose carnivorous?
My God!
How could you be homesick?
You got there yesterday.
You' re coming home tomorrow.
Val?
We' re good to go here.
Waiting on you.
Did my agent call?
Any word on that TV movie?
The interracial abortion, gene- splicing thing?
I think the TV movie decided to go with peter Bogdanovich.
Oh, th- th- that' s great.
Th- Th- That' s just great.
You know, l- I love peter. peter' s a beautiful guy.
- [Stammering]
God bless him.
I, uh...
Val, the client wants more overhead coverage of the spray cans.
One minute.
Lori, this is humiliating.
l- I' m up here shooting a deodorant commercial.
You need antlers.
Here' s a funny script about two kids in a college fraternity... who invent a machine that can turn women back into virgins again.
It' s very clever.
What' s the matter?
You know, when you asked me to come out here for you, you promised me... that I wasn' t just going to be one of those bright women who- who finds properties... and goes to lunch 500 times developing them, and then never gets one made.
Honey, The City That Never Sleeps is green- lit.
- That' s been your project from day one.
- Yeah, sure.
Until I suggest the director.
And then even though you admit he' d be perfect for it...
- I get shot down.
- You didn' t get shot down, honey.
I know that that' s a risky choice, but it' s an inspired choice.
I think you' re trying to help him because you feel guilty.
Why should I feel guilty?
Because I fell in love with you?
I mean, God knows I put enough years in that marriage.
- That' s right.
You did absolutely nothing wrong.
I brought up his name because... [Sighs] because he would give you the best movie for that script.
- Nobody argued that.
- He' s probably so angry he won' t even speak to you.
And he' s liable to ruin the picture just to get even with me.
No.
I' m telling you, you' re wrong.
He would be grateful.
- He needs a comeback, and...
- Ellie, this is a very, very expensive film.
It' s got solid box- office potential.
He can do it.
You don' t regret leaving him, do you?
You know, one day you look up and you realize that laughs are not enough.
I can handle him, Hal.
I just got tired of having to all the time.
And then, you know... then I met you.
- What are you doing home?
I quit.
[Gasps]
Val, not again.
- You quit over nothing again?
- Not over nothing.
- What?
- I quit over a big thing.
- What?
- They fired me.
That was big enough to quit over.
Oh, Val!
That' s just great.
I got the last plane out of Toronto.
Have you ever seen Canada?
Now I know why there' s no crime up there.
Boy, I must say... you don' t seem too enthused over seeing me.
Well, can you blame me?
What are you gonna do now?
You' re gonna sit around the apartment, talking about the good old days.
I gotta get a picture.
Boy, somebody' s got to take a chance on me.
This is ridiculous.
When you' re cold, you' re cold.
Fortunately, my business manager put away enough money before he went to prison...
- so I could hold out another three weeks, maybe.
- Your agent called.
Hey, you know, if you' d come up there with me, it might have been different.
Two people in that sleeping bag is a lot cozier than one.
And who goes on for me in the play?
For God sakes, it' s an off- off- Broadway play.
You' re in the last stages.
Your understudy could have gone on for you.
My understudy?
Right, and that will be the one night... that Steven Spielberg comes to see the play, or Harvey Weinstein.
They' re not coming, believe me.
They' re fasting.
I would' ve been so good in that Shakespeare movie.
Oh!
These are pelts.
l- I traded with a fur trapper between shots... so the trip wouldn' t be a total loss.
- Your agent sent over that script.
Why didn' t you tell me about this?
"The City That Never Sleeps."
When did this come in?
What did you think of it?
You know, I thought it had definite potential.
It' s got a, you know, really good Manhattan feel to it.
You know, they' re interested in you directing.
You know, that' s fine with me.
You know, this is the kind of material that I can really do great.
This is...
You know, I can make this script sing.
This is New York.
It' s nightclubs.
It' s the skyline.
- You want some water?
I' m very excited.
- Please.
Me too.
- Who wants me?
- Well, uh, we have a little selling to do... but, uh, Galaxie is making it.
- Hal Yeager?
- Yes, that' s right.
- He stole my wife.
- Ellie is the one who' s pushing for you.
Pass.
I' m not gonna work with Hal Yeager and Ellie.
He' s a philistine and she' s a quisling.
- It' s a religious conflict.
It' s everything you' ve been looking for.
You know, I' m frankly flabbergasted they would even think of me.
Well, they didn' t think of you.
And she has convinced Yeager to come fly to New York and take a meeting with you.
- This guy stole my wife.
- He doesn' t hold that against you.
It' s business.
Can you believe that she would leave me for- for Hal Yeager?
I still can' t get my mind around it.
Mr. Slick...
- The price of his haircut could feed a family of five.
You' re getting all red.
Would you calm down.
And you' re telling me she... he doesn' t want me?
The nerve of them.
He' s such a manicured phony.
May he fall on his blow comb... and get hot in the wrong place.
Please, Val.
Please don' t do anything to kill this.
It' s a golden opportunity.
Forget it.
I would rather do the geriatric diaper commercial I turned down.
Would you?
Because that' s what the future holds if this falls through.
This is a terrific script.
- Make some sense now.
A $60 million dollar, first- class feature film.
A big payday, which you need.
And if you score with this one, you' re back on top.
You' il never have a gift like this drop in your lap again.
Just take the meeting with Yeager.
- And Ellie?
- Yes, and Ellie.
I' m telling you, I' il get you half a million dollars.
A lousy half- mil they' re offering?
They want to buy prestige at the Shrine Auditorium Oscar night for a half- mil?
There' s no offer.
It' s not an offer yet.
- I reject their offer.
- There is nothing to reject.
- [Laughs]
You better meet with him and you better be nice, or else I' m out of here.
I finally get an offer that' s worthy of my gifts, and look where it comes from.
There is no offer yet.
And I am so tired of all this...
The big talk about how big you were ten years ago.
Things change, and you can' t get work.
- You know, part of me wants it so badly.
- And the other part?
Also wants it.
That' s the problem.
- It only takes one hit.
- I know.
- And I want a role in this movie.
- I don' t have the movie yet.
He' s gotta meet me and throw his weight around first.
And not just a little bit.
Something where I can show off what I can do.
Lori, I can' t stick my girlfriend in the movie.
I' m not just your girlfriend.
Remember all those times I told you you should take acting lessons?
I' m a natural.
Classes would ruin me.
Jesus.
You know, Ellie feels guilty about dumping me... so this is her way of clearing her conscience.
What' s the difference how it came about?
This whole thing is creepy, Lori.
For God sakes, this is a woman I was married to for 10 years.
We made love.
I' d hold her head over the toilet bowl when she threw up.
- From making love with you?
- Not from making love with me.
From eating sushi.
For God' s sakes, I used to hug her when she was afraid of flying.
And- And, you know, I kissed her on top of the Eiffel Tower.
I swam in the moonlight with her at Montauk.
Now suddenly I got to take a meeting with her?
I don' t know.
I' ve got very mixed feelings.
This guy has really got to show me he' s changed.
He' s not in a position to make extraordinary demands.
Because it was over for him years ago.
He hasn' t touched anything for years... garbage.
I' m telling you, garbage.
I mean, I' m not saying that as criticism, you know.
The question is, do I wanna let this has- been make his comeback picture on my money?
- He' s not a has- been.
- [Scoffs]
- who' s fallen on some difficulty times.
- He brought it on himself.
He' s his own worst enemy.
Look, think of the press angle, you know.
Val Waxman does his comeback film for Galaxie pictures.
What good is the press if the guy ruins the picture?
He' s not gonna ruin the picture.
No, you' re damn right he' s not because I' il fire him.
I' m not going to take temperamental antics from some "owteur" genius.
- Auteur. Auteur.
- Whatever.
Okay, auteur.
You' re doing a jack story, okay?
He can do this film better than anybody I can think of.
We' il see.
- You' re so nervous.
You' re making me nervous.
- I' m not nervous.
- You are nervous.
- I' m tense.
When I' m nervous, I bite my nails.
When I' m tense, I do this with my collar.
- Just act...
Calm down and act professional.
- I am.
But this is a guy who stole my wife.
Years ago, I would never have consented to make a film for him... and now... now suddenly I' m auditioning for him?
It' s crazy.
You know, I would kill for this job... but the people I want to kill are the people who are offering me the job.
- It' s just insanity.
- What is that?
- Remember in the cab I took a blue pill?
- Yeah?
Well, that was to calm my anger.
But it had speed in it.
So then I took another pill after that to calm down the speed.
Well, this gets me back up to speed, where I want to be actually for the meeting.
- Great.
Perfect.
- Yeah.
Then that other pill I took keeps me dry when it' s raining out.
- Ellie.
Ellie.
Hello, Al.
- So good to see you.
- Hello, Val.
Hello, Val.
- Al.
How are you?
Good to see you.
I' m so glad you could get here.
Are they still having power failures?
I read that there was a terrible power failure in California.
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Coffee would be wonderful.
Electricity.
That the electricity was going off.
Come on in.
- Since when do you wear suits?
- You have any milk?
- You never wore suits.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh, cream.
Well, Val, you look very good.
I' ve been having some back spasms... and I have a torn rotator cuff, and- and, my knee...
You know, I got a hearing loss.
It' s the oddest thing.
In my left ear...
- What did you think of the script?
- The script?
You know, the movie that it' s based on was a stupid little potboiler.
He' s asking about the script.
- But the rewrite is good.
- Thanks to Ellie.
She did all the work.
Yeah, it' s good.
You know, I think this could make... a kind of tough, gritty, New York, big city movie.
You can' t make any money just in big cities.
Well, I mean, where do you think this is going to play?
It' s not going to appeal to farmers or shopping malls in Biloxi.
Oh, I completely disagree.
I think if this picture is mounted properly... it' s gonna have universal appeal.
Where do you think the demographics are?
The- The demographics?
You mean why the country got so stupid suddenly?
- [Chuckles]
The age group.
The age group of this film.
The age?
adults and teenagers, young adults... and, you know, kids, adolescents, I think.
Toddlers, I imagine.
Newborns.
Our marketing research shows this film has wide appeal for both sexes.
Yes, I agree and then some, actually.
- But, the script has some holes in it.
- Val...
Like what?
Well, take the climax, for instance.
I think the climax comes... comes too early is the problem.
- It should come after the trial scene.
- Didn' t I say that?
The inciting event should come later.
The character of Benny.
I feel we should shoot Benny... with a hand- held camera and not a Steadicam.
It should, you know...
Put the audience ill at ease, like his inner- personality.
I don' t know if I like that.
It could be with a Steadicam.
You even said that.
Let me ask you how you' d feel about this, and be honest.
What if we shot the whole picture in black and white?
- Because New York City is a black- and- white town.
- It reeks of black and white.
- Forget it.
Arty.
It' s arty.
Does anybody have an aspirin?
Do you have an aspirin?
Here, try one of these.
My herbalist gave them to me.
I can do this picture.
I got a feel for it.
- I see it all, maybe with like a Cole porter score?
- All right.
Let us discuss it.
We' re talking to a couple of other directors and, um, we' il let you know.
Maybe Irving Berlin or something.
You bridge the...
Well, I think we' d have to discuss it.
You know, if there ever was a Val Waxman property, boy, this is it, right?
- We' il keep in touch.
- Does anyone have a Xanax?
I' ve got an ulcer too.
- NotZantac, Xanax.
- It' s a completely different problem.
Oh, sorry.
It was great seeing you again.
It was.
- You' ve got an herbalist?
- Oh, yes.
A genius.
In Beverly Hills he' s a genius.
If he was in New York, he' d be considered low- normal.
You know, we use a completely different rating system here.
When we were kids, there were like ten foreign films a week in this city.
- Italian, French...
- Oh, Italian films.
I love them.
Val Waxman.
You' re sure?
Okay.
Did you see my cat?
Isn' t that neat?
- Sorry about that.
- Anything?
- We were just talking aboutAlfred Hitchcock.
- Truffaut said Notorious was his best film.
- I agree.
A masterpiece.
What are you talking about?
You hate...
He hates that movie.
The ending makes you crazy.
Yes, because it' s a masterpiece.
Every time I watch that movie... when Cary Grant is carrying Ingrid Bergman down the staircase...
- I always think that the Germans are going to catch them.
- I do too.
No matter how many times I see it, I think the Germans are gonna get them.
- Hitchcock was an artist, but he was commercial.
- Yeah, that' s right.
- You say that like it' s a good thing.
- You have to be both.
I mean, he knew what he was doing.
In order to make movies... you have to think about the audience, you have to...
Otherwise, you' re just making movies for yourself, like artistic masturbation.
- That' s right.
You' re a narcissist.
- I' m a classic narcissist then.
Have I told you my views on masturbation ever?
For me, the nicest thing about masturbation is afterward, the cuddling time.
I' m not joking.
- Want a wienie?
You got it.
You' re directing The City That Never Sleeps.
I just got the call.
I can' t believe it.
I can' t speak.
I got you half a million, plus a tenth of a point after quadruple break- even.
Listen, uh, they' re going back to L. A. tonight.
You think you could meet Ellie for a drink for ten minutes?
- Why?
- Why?
Because you owe her some thanks, that' s why.
She went out on a limb for you.
I think she wants to make sure you' re both on the same page.
Think about Hal Yeager.
He' s quick to hire, quick to fire.
You need Ellie to run interference.
All right.
Bemelmans Bar at 9: 00.
I can spare ten minutes.
l- I can' t tell ya, my head' s swimming.
A tenth of a point after quadruple break- even.
You are really a shark, Al.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Can I get a Beck' s, please?
Since we' re working together, I thought we should sit down and talk for a few minutes.
That' s fine with me.
I mean, as you know, Hal was a little skeptical at first... but in the end, you know, he' s a businessman and very professional.
Let me set your mind at ease.
You don' t have to worry about everything.
Things are gonna go very smoothly.
This is a big shot for me and I realize that... you know, many people think that I' m... that I can be difficult.
But you know I can be very professional... and obviously, Hal Yeager' s very professional... and you' re professional, clearly.
So, you know, as long as business is business, there should be no...
I cannot understand how you could leave me for that cheesy windbag.
It' s mind- numbing to me.
I just don' t understand that.
And you carry on with him behind my back for two months.
- It was not two months.
- Yes.
Don' t tell me it wasn' t.
Not even behind my back, but under my nose.
- That' s twice a day.
Both places.
- Okay, you' re exaggerating.
I' m not exaggerating.
You were always on the phone with him.
You were exchanging glances.
I noticed it.
Then suddenly, you were exchanging fluids.
l- I can' t believe that I didn' t really see it.
You were too self- absorbed.
You were too intent on becoming the greatAmerican film artist.
Everything was fine with you until I started to lose my audience.
Then suddenly you dump me and move out to Beverly Hills with the swimming pool.
You hated California.
We both hated it.
You hated traveling every place by car all the time.
And I hated traveling by mud slide.
Well, what did you want me to do?
Our marriage wasn' t going anyplace.
Where did you want it to go?
Where do marriages go?
After awhile they all lay there.
- That' s the thing about marriages.
- Look...
- No, it was in trouble for a long time.
You see, you don' t see what you don' t want to see.
How was it in trouble?
We didn' t communicate.
- We had sex.
- Yes, we had sex.
But we never talked.
Sex is better than talk.
Ask anybody in this bar.
- You can' t...
- Talk is what you suffer through so you can get to sex.
You isolate everything.
You can' t just compartmentalize like that.
A good marriage consists of many parts well- integrated.
- Never.
Absolutely.
For God sakes, I got the bill.
You had the escargot that afternoon.
It' s so disgusting.
Sex and snails with that roast beef from Beverly Hills.
You were so busy playing the American artist.
That' s what you were doing, playing.
God, difficult!
To starve and to suffer.
I tell you, you had all the symptoms, not the disease.
You used to think I was creative and original.
And I still do... as a filmmaker.
It' s when you became creative as a hypochondriac, that was it.
- Hey, all those attacks were for real.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.
- The Black plague, Val?
An allergy to oxygen?
Only trees get Elm blight...
Elm trees.
Can I sum it up?
You cheated on me.
You lied.
You dumped me...
We' re here to discuss business.
- That' s right.
- Can we discuss it?
- I wanna keep this absolutely on a professional level.
- Absolutely.
I think that we should rework the script a little bit... because I think it doesn' t have to be middle- aged people.
We could make the character of Kelly Swain, you know, maybe coming out of college.
- That' s true.
You mean out of law school?
- Law school, yeah.
I think they' d like that at Galaxie.
That way we could cast somebody like Terry Tyler...
- Great. - or maybe find... there' s a lot of talented kids out there.
You are such a shallow jerk!
I can' t get my mind around it.
That you would leave me for a guy who is the opposite of everything I am.
You know, with his ski lodge in Aspen and his collection of vintage cars.
If I drove around in a 1939 Mercedes, people would think I was Himmler.
Hal' s very smart, and he' s a brilliant deal maker.
Yes, I know.
He' s been audited by the best.
He has made some pretty financially successful American films.
That should tell you all you need to know about him.
He' s the white line down the middle of the road.
You had your little flirtations too.
There was that- that Italian model.
You were the only one that I was serious with.
My God.
Until you suddenly became noncommunicative, nonresponsive and you dumped me...
The movie is going to be a fun movie to do, I think.
Um, and I have a lot of ideas that I think we should discuss.
Good.
[Heavy Breathing]
Well, thank you very much.
I think I want a foreign cameraman.
- That' s no problem.
- Because they get a texture into the work... that you would never get with an American cameraman.
They have a certain mobility.
I remember coming home and I picked up the extension... and there you are on the other end of the extension with this guy.
I' m calling and I hear my wife in a lovey- dovey with her lover, saying she misses her lover.
- Bull!
He was your lover.
What are you telling me?
And I recognize the voice.
It' s Hal Yeager from Galaxie pictures.
And I' m thinking to myself, "Why is my wife talking like that to Hal Yeager for?"
They' re making me a surprise party.
I thought they were making me a surprise party.
- No.
She was having an affair with Hal Yeager.
- Follow the story.
Jesus, I can' t believe this...
- I' m getting out of here.
Wait a minute.
We' re discussing a movie.
- No, I' m sorry.
I just...
- What about...
I' il be back and forth from L. A. and I won' t bother you... and I' il see to it that nobody gets in your way creatively.
- What about Denise Daniels as the blackmailer?
- Possibly.
If you like.
I think she would be great.
You know what I mean?
Or Sarah Bedloe.
She would be very interesting.
She...
I pick up the phone and she' s talking...
I' m going to order a corn beef sandwich, she' s talking to her lover on the phone.
- Look, I' il be back from L. A. in two weeks...
- This is gonna be a fun picture.
- It' il be great.
- I' m looking forward to it.
The word on him is cross- dresser.
Check it out for me.
I pick the phone up and she...
- Hal, we' re off to a really good start here.
- Tell me about it, honey.
Val wants to use a foreign cameraman, which I think we should give him.
He' s got a real visual concept of where he wants to go with this thing.
Um, now he' s chosen Kow Chan, a Chinese cameraman... done some stunning work, mostly with the Red Army.
He says he doesn' t like his hotel.
He much prefer the Sherry.
Hal, listen.
Val wants to go with Elio Sebastian as art director.
Val says that Elio really knows the streets of New York.
Every location in the script is out there waiting to be found.
It saves us a fortune.
Times Square and Harlem.
I have to build Times Square and Harlem.
We can' t build Times Square and Harlem.
With all due respect.
He wants to build the Empire State Building?
- Just the first 20 stories.
- Absolutely not.
No, sweetheart.
It' s not gonna happen, okay?
Just tell him no.
It' s not gonna happen.
- All right, I' il handle it.
Hey, listen.
I miss you.
How' s the weather back there?
It' s been great, you know?
Very gray and cloudy.
- That' s the way it is.
- Today' s the first day of sun we' ve had in awhile.
Well, listen, here it' s been fabulous.
Sunny and clear every day.
I gotta run.
I' m having another skin cancer removed.
[Val]
This view is absolutely perfect.
I hate it.
I' m... we' re just gonna have to build it.
- Yeah.
- mixing real locations and sets...
I say this metaphorically... it' d have to be done over my dead body... metaphorically.
All right, if not the whole park, then just the reservoir.
- Uh- huh.
You know what?
It' il work.
And then...
Wait... trees behind it, you know?
- New York as a symphony in green.
I never use green.
- No.
No green.
Tell Mother Nature, okay?
- Trees are green.
- We can play it for the winter.
I buy that.
A white background to set off the two leads... and marvelous' 40s red.
- What?
What?
What?
- [Continues]
No white.
He cannot shoot white background.
Sebastian, what have you gotten me into here?
I prefer green myself.
Green and red.
All I' m saying is that I think you' re being precipitous in firing him.
- Look, I never wanted this guy.
- Hal...
I beg your entire pardon.
May I just offer for your consideration...
- a single concept, and I say this...
- You don' t have to...
- Stand up, you don' t have to lean into the speaker.
- Look, he' s out.
I want this guy out before this picture becomes a cost nightmare.
Look, Hal, I think that maybe if we had a talk with him.
I said from the start to use Harold pappas.
Pappas is a hack.
Pappas is safe, but he' s uninspired.
I can' t work with him.
- Then you should bow out now.
I didn' t say I wouldn' t.
Val, I don' t mean to get hot under the collar, but pappas has how many nominations... compared to this Greenwich Village lunatic?
They probably spent more money getting those nominations...
- than he' il spend building a reservoir.
- I didn' t get that.
- Nothing.
- I gave in on the Chinese cameraman.
I' ve kept away from your picture.
- A word to the wise.
- Is there anything about the part of Benny... that you want to tell me before I read it?
Only that he' s a Broadway sharpie, a gambler.
- Like Sky Masterson?
- Perfect.
Now, forgive me, it might seem obvious, but he' s a Runyonesque... bookmaker- type, uh, is tough, but softhearted with his wife who he' s nuts about?
That' s it on the nose.
That would be perfect.
Go.
Jerry, some guys were over the house looking for you.
Seems you owe some money.
I hope you didn' t tell them anything, Helen.
I could find myself in deep trouble.
- Deep, deep trouble.
- Thank you.
[Nervous Giggle]
I' il wait for you.
If they give you 30 years, I' il be waiting.
If they give you 50 years, I' il be waiting.
I' il be waiting.
I thought that last girl was kind of interesting.
Did you?
- Really?
- I thought she read it better than the others.
I know, but Claire' s supposed to be classy.
Didn' t you think she was a little on the cheap side?
- Cheap?
- To be perfectly honest, I thought she radiated stupidity.
- Stupidity?
- I mean, her reading was competent enough... but, my God, it' s like her persona... it' s trashy and dumb.
Well, you know, I think I' d like to use her.
She was interesting.
- You' re the director.
- It' s not that big a part, Ellie.
But it' s a featured role.
Claire' s supposed to be a socialite, for God sakes.
This girl, "Lori Fox," she' s like a step above trailer park.
- Well, I would hardly call her trailer park.
- I said a step above.
Well, I' d like to use her.
Fine.
I mean, it' s your decision.
I' m just throwing out ideas.
You can take 'em or leave' em.
Two for Yeager, please.
- They' re clearing your table, Mr. Yeager.
- Thank you.
I am so glad that you could come in.
I really am.
I was here on business and I wanted an excuse to see you.
- I didn' t want you to think I was crowding you.
- I know you, you know.
You' re checking up on me.
It is.
- And Val?
- Val' s Val.
He seems reasonably flexible.
- Most of his ideas are really good.
You' il see.
- I hope so.
- Right this way.
- Thank you.
- There are no personal feelings that make it seem awkward?
- Good.
By the way...
Andrea Ford' s going to be covering the making of the film for Esquire.
Oh, no kid...
Hey, Val.
We were just talking about you.
Hey, Val.
Ellie was telling me how well things are going.
- [Stammering]
Good to see you.
Everything all right?
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean, "What am I doing..."
- No, what are you doing here at this moment?
- We used to eat here.
- Hal came in on a plane a few hours ago.
- That' s the best way to fly.
What are you doing in this restaurant at this moment?
What do you mean?
Are you all right?
You' re awfully fidgety or something.
- What are you doing?
Are you okay?
- Yes, no, I' m fine.
I was just thinking you should go to your table because it' s crowded here.
- I' m ready to go.
- It' s the woman that was at the audition today.
- [Giggling]
- Hello, miss.
- Aren' t you going to introduce me?
- It' s Lori Fox, isn' t it?
- Yes, of course.
- I think it was.
Yes.
Val is such a riot.
Stop kidding around.
I really wanted to put your mind at ease... that just because I' m the director' s significant other, I can still act.
- [Man]
Hal?
- Hey, Mort.
I thought you were in Aspen.
- I wish.
- You know Ellie, my fiancée?
- Hi.
How are you?
- Hi.
I' m Lori Fox.
Nice to meet you.
- F- F- Fiancée?
- Congratulations.
When' s the date?
My goodness, how romantic.
That' s wonderful.
- Congratulations on your new film.
- You know Val Waxman.
- Of course.
We sued him...
- Fiancée? - for failure to complete a picture.
- That makes me feel secure.
I' il see you tomorrow, Val.
Hurry!
I' il miss my flight.
This is not a good time for you to go away.
I' m very vulnerable.
If I' m gonna be in this movie, I have to get into shape.
This spa is the only way I' il ever have the discipline.
- But you' re not overweight.
I' m a horse.
- I have to appear in lingerie.
- What if we need you?
It' s a ten- week shooting schedule.
My scene doesn' t come until the very end.
What if I need you?
I' m going through a bad time.
You' il be fine.
You' re a big boy.
Oh, geez.
You know, I' m afraid to sleep alone.
l- l- I keep thinking people are breaking in.
I lay awake all night... thinking of death and the blackness and the abyss.
Oh, oh, don' t forget to water my cactus.
- Call me every day.
- I can' t.
They don' t have any phones at Dolby Ranch.
They want to discourage secret eating schemes.
- [Woman Over p. A., Indistinct]
Oh, my gosh.
Okay, I gotta go.
Gotta go!
And we want to see the earrings.
Profile.
Other profile, please.
And cut.
Thank you.
Is it true your cameraman speaks only Chinese?
Yes, Mandarin.
It' s so hard to find a good Cantonese cameraman these days.
Neighborhoods just don' t have them anymore.
Hal Yeager' s known to be very hands- on, very hot- tempered... quick to replace people.
- Does that bother you?
- No, because the deal is... they' re going to leave me alone during the shooting.
- I have complete freedom.
- How about working so closely with your ex- wife?
Well, it' s not so close.
It' s not going to be that close.
Well, there must be some bitterness.
Especially now that she' s going to marry Hal Yeager, the man she left you for... who' s now your boss?
Who are you?
Oh, I' m Andrea Ford.
I' m going to be doing the story... on the making of the movie for Esquire.
- Oh, really.
Are you?
- Yeah.
Didn' t they tell you?
I' m going to be observing the whole time.
'Cause I don' t usually like, you know, when journalists hang around the set...
- and observe when I work.
- Take that up with the press department.
But don' t worry.
I won' t get in your way.
I promise.
I am a huge fan.
- [Clears Throat]
- Oh, huge.
I have loved all of your movies.
Oh, well, you know...
And you' il be hanging around doing a story here?
Because, in fact, I' ve always thought of you as a unique American artist.
Well, I' m sure you won' t be in the way here.
Val.
Hey, gosh, I' m so sorry.
Can I steal him for a minute?
- I really was about to...
- Some things we have to go over.
I' il get him right back to you.
I' m so sorry.
In one minute.
I' m so sorry.
- You need to be careful.
- She' s a killer?
I didn' t think it was a good idea having her around all the time.
But then the press department told Hal that they could get the cover of Esquire and so...
- How is she a killer?
She loves me.
- Well, that' s fine.
I mean, if she likes you, you know.
Otherwise, she can be biting.
- I hear she' s all sugar and sweetness... and gets into your good graces and then wham!
She kept telling Sean Madigan how she loved all of his films and she was a big fan.
How he was a great, I don' t know, unique American artist.
- Really?
- And then in the profile, she disemboweled him.
You know, if you happen to fall for that kind of flattery...
- I can handle it, though.
You couldn' t handle Shirley Temple.
Give me a break, will ya?
You know, I can' t figure it out.
It' s okay to have an affair with Hal Yeager, but... you know, everyone is entitled to have one psychotic episode in their lives, but...
- to marry the guy is...
- Honestly, I wouldn' t talk if I were you.
- What does that mean?
- I don' t know.
How long have you been living with that wind- up doll I met?
You know I don' t like to sleep alone.
For God' s sakes, I' m not going to marry her.
And that wind- up doll happens to have a ph. D.
In what?
History of gym?
Hey, look.
Will you give me a break with the cutting remarks?
I got a picture to do Tuesday.
I' m thinking about my work.
I want you to get some rest this weekend, okay?
And don' t lie around the whole time worrying about everything that could go wrong.
Don' t worry.
I' m not going to lie around.
I' ve got my hand on the wheel, honey.
This picture' s in the bank.
Amanda, honey, who is it?
- I don' t know.
- [All Groaning]
- Please, I' m sorry.
- A man or woman?
- Hello?
- Al, you gotta get over here right away.
Why?
I' m at my sister' s for a Seder.
Al, you gotta get over here.
This is a matter of life and death!
- [Knocking On Door]
Come in!
- What is it?
What' s going on?
What am I doing here?
Al, I going to try to explain this to you.
I came home, and I started to make notes on the script, you know... because we shoot Tuesday and I wanted, you know... then I started to get nervous.
So, I sat down on the sofa, and I was doing my deep- breathing exercises... just to stay calm, you know?
And it was working, and I started to relax, and I dozed off.
Then I slept for a while.
I can' t see anything.
- What?
- I' m blind.
I' m blind, Al.
What?
I' m blind.
I can' t see.
- What do you mean, you can' t see?
- What do I mean?
Those guys in the street with the dark glasses and accordions?
What are you talking about?
Are you trying?
Al, you can' t try and see.
You look around and you see or you don' t see.
I don' t see.
- How can you be blind?
- Howthe hell do I know how I can be blind?
- I' m...
Al, I' m scared.
- What did you eat?
What' s the difference what I ate?
You- You- You can' t lose your vision from a plate of tofu.
- l- I never heard of anything like this.
- Yes.
- Yeah?
- He lost his vision suddenly.
- From what?
- Grapefruit.
- Grapefruit?
Yes, he had a tumor the size of a grapefruit on his brain.
- And he went blind?
- Yes, he went blind... and- and a few months later he went dead... which is worse than blind 'cause your options decrease.
Relax.
You don' t have a brain tumor.
I have to hear that from somebody who went to a greater medical school... than the William Morris agency.
We' il get you to Dr. Mason.
No.
Mason dropped dead on the treadmill.
I use Koch.
You know, I use Koch too.
Did you bump into anything?
Did you fall?
Did you bump your head or something?
Nothing!
Al, I got a brain tumor.
That' s the story here.
l- I...
I see the wall.
- I thought you said you couldn' t see.
- It' s an expression.
I don' t actually mean I see a wall.
It' s in my mind' s eye.
Listen.
You insisted on taking you to the hospital because you were convinced...
- Oh, God.
Ellie!
Look, if I die, Al, tell Ellie I' m sorry I said all those things to her.
I said terrible things to her.
I called her all kinds of names.
- Probably because I never stopped loving her.
You' re not dying.
Well, if I don' t die, tell her she' s a tramp and she' s living with a guy... the best you could say about him is sometimes he returns phone calls.
Oh, Dr. Koch.
It' s Al Hack here.
I' m sorry to call you at home on holiday, but I' m sitting here with Val Waxman...
Okay, you can sit back now.
- So- So, what is the story?
- Well, your optic nerve is normal.
- Your eye exam is normal.
I don' t see anything.
- Wonderful.
You don' t see anything?
I don' t see anything either.
That' s the problem.
Any tumor large enough to impact on his vision so dramatically would show up.
I only wish I was in as good health as he is.
This is a textbook scenario. physically, you' re 100 percent.
But just like someone who has an hysterical paralysis... a patient who' s fine but he can' t walk... or a patient who loses his or her voice... from witnessing a horrible shock or any extreme, stress- related trauma...
Being a film director, your inner- conflicts... have chosen to express themselves in this very telling fashion.
You' re psychosomatically blind.
- How can I get rid of it?
- By treatment.
By understanding the roots of your conflict...
- there' s every chance that this blindness will go away.
- How quickly?
Well, real growth is always very slow.
- There goes my comeback.
You cannot breathe a word of this to anybody.
I gotta tell 'em, Al.
You know, I just dread telling Ellie.
Are you nuts?
They' il fire you.
I obviously can' t direct the picture.
What are you talking about?
How can you blow this shot?
What are you talking about?
I' m blind.
- Nobody knows.
- What the hell does that mean?
What are you suggesting?
If you pull out of this project now because psychological stress... has caused you to lose your sight, you' il never work again.
- They' il burn your union card.
- Maybe they could postpone it.
Oh, yeah, because you' re blind?
Val, direct this picture and bring in a hit... or I leave you with two words: homeless man.
- I can' t direct...
How can I...
- I' m telling you how.
You' re going to muddle your way through until your sight returns.
Al, I can' t direct a picture.
I' m blind.
Have you seen some of the pictures out there?
The first five minutes they' il catch me.
Maybe they will, maybe they won' t.
If they do, you' re no worse off than if you confess... because you' re finished in the business anyway.
You gotta be joking.
I' il take one step on the set, I' il break my neck.
No, no, no.
I' il come with you.
They won' t let you.
The actors get nervous when agents hang around.
It' s against Galaxie policy.
Listen.
Once you get on the set, you get relaxed, you won' t even need me.
There' s no way to do this.
I would have to take somebody into my confidence.
Absolutely not.
Not a hint.
This can' t get out.
You will direct a hit picture.
Sometimes God works in strange ways.
Like Job.
Notes on "Making of The City That Never Sleeps."
Lots of eager anticipation.
People moving lights.
Actors and actresses all ready in costume and makeup.
Val Waxman is not the first one on the set.
Actually, a few minutes late.
- This is never going to work.
- It' s working perfect.
Just stand straight.
- Am I going to bump into anything?
- No, no, no.
I' il guide you.
You don' t trust me.
You have to trust me.
- I gotta look funny.
- You look perfect.
I' m telling you.
- l- l- I...
- Look at this.
How wonderful.
Good morning.
Would you like anything?
Any coffee?
- Coffee.
Want some coffee?
- Coffee.
Yeah.
- No.
No.
No.
No thank you.
- Okay.
Well, the actors are here if you' re ready to block the scene.
We could...
Listen, Val.
Are you okay with the changes in the set?
- Oh, the set.
- Oh.
It' s great.
How do you feel about the background color?
It' s blue and, you know, brown and yellow, but is it a little dark?
Beg your pardon, who are you?
I' m Al Hack.
Al, can I speak to you a second?
- Yeah, uh, I' il be right back.
Don' t worry.
I' il be right back.
- Al?
- Not that you' re not welcome here.
You know I love you.
- Yes, yes.
- But, you know, this is a closed set.
Oh, well, you see, he really needs me.
He likes me to be with him.
I know, but a man of your stature... an agent...
- you know, it intimidates people.
- Oh...
- You look so good.
Have you had any work done?
- Just over here.
A little?
'Cause I...
Who did you go to?
Not that I need it...
- Fred.
Fred. - but I' m thinking about it.
Oh, he' s incredible.
You got the best clients.
Can you get me a price?
I think that we may be like a little bit too light.
Would you prefer that I take the whole thing one shade darker?
Eh, well, that' s a... that' s a possibility.
What do you think?
What would you do?
Well, I really don' t know.
It' s possible I could make the whole thing match the upholstery.
That' s another option.
That' s brilliant.
That' s what I would do.
I would match the upholstery.
Excuse me.
Chief, what alarm clock would you like to go with?
- Uh, that one.
That one.
- Which one?
Which - - Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
- You like the wind- up or the electric?
- Yes.
The wind- up.
Wind- up.
- I like the wind- up.
- Val?
Val?
Excuse me.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Can I see you just for a second?
Don' t worry.
- Excuse me.
- Al, this is not working.
Don' t worry.
It' s going to work fine.
But you' re right.
It is a closed set, and I have to leave.
- Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Just go to plan "B."
- What is plan "B"?
We don' t have a plan "B."
- We gotta find somebody... who you trust who will help you.
- Someone you can rely on.
- You mean, tell someone the truth?
Somebody you can rely on.
We' il get somebody who' s around you all the time.
Who doesn' t look odd, you know?
Maybe the A. D.?
What about the script girl?
They' il get in trouble.
If they get caught... they' il never work in the business again.
l- I have a responsibility, Al, to Ellie and even to Hal.
You have a responsibility to yourself!
You have agent' s ethics.
I can' t go by you.
Don' t hit me with oxymorons at this time.
We' re in a crisis!
Shh.
What about the Chinese kid?
- The translator?
- Yes, the translator.
The translator.
He' s a business student at NYU, right?
He doesn' t care if he' s in the movie business.
If he gets caught, it' s no big penalty.
- Well, he is always around me.
It' s a natural- natural...
- Yes, see?
Val, I' ve got the actors.
We are ready for you.
Don' t worry.
Don' t worry.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
I' il take you.
I' il take you.
It' s gonna be fine.
Listen.
You got a reputation for being crazy.
This is the perfect time for it to work in your favor.
Watch out.
One step.
Ah, very good.
Hey, can I have Mr. Waxman' s chair here?
- The director needs his chair.
Where is it?
- Chair?
Thank you very much.
Here, come sit.
- Oh.
- Isn' t that wonderful?
Sit, sit, sit.
Be relaxed.
Real good.
Good luck.
- I can' t work with outside people watching me.
- Nobody' s gonna be watching.
- Incidentally, you like this one or this one?
- I like that one.
- This one?
'Cause this one' s more like...
- Yes, that one. what they' d really use, but this one' s more theatrical.
Well, you know, you can use this one if you' d like.
But I prefer that one.
- Which one?
- This one.
- I' d like to make my entrance from the stairs.
What...
Who ordered?
Who ordered?
What' s happening?
- How do you want me to kiss her?
- What' s happening here?
- [Stammering]
- You know, on the... on the mouth.
- What about my mouth?
- No, kiss her on the mouth.
- He hasn' t seen here for six years.
We originally discussed some kind of passionate way of grabbing her.
Oh, well, use both lips.
Oh, excuse me.
Could I talk to you just for a second?
- Yeah, just for a minute.
- Uh, they need me.
- Well, actually, the director...
- The director asked me to talk to you.
Yes.
- Mr. Waxman?
It' s a chance to make some extra salary.
Now, you seem to be a very responsible young man.
Are you?
- You should move left.
You got me doing two things at once here.
I can' t work if I don' t know what you want.
- You should cross left.
Me?
You mean my left?
- If I cross my left, I' m going to bump right into him.
- You don' t have to bump me.
- I' m probably going to knock him over.
- Where is the translator?
- Excuse me.
- [All Talking]
- Sir, I have a very important message for you.
- Important message for me?
Um, I' m here to help you.
I know about your secret.
Don' t!
Cut!
Very good.
Was it very good?
Was it very good?
Well, I don' t see the dramatic impact of it.
But it did seem a little improvement from the random chaos...
- you were encouraging.
- Oh, thank you.
You didn' t like the random chaos, huh?
Can we go again?
Just for safety, one more?
Okay, sir, we' re approaching a hallway right now.
So we' re gonna walk slowly.
There' s nobody here.
- Practically nobody.
- Okay.
- Be careful.
- I' m trying to be casual, but it' s extremely difficult.
- Oh, I know that...
- Ooh!
Boss, you all right?
Yes.
No, I' m fine.
It was my fault completely.
I forgive you.
Sir, he' s gone.
He' s not there anymore.
You' re talking to air.
Why didn' t you warn me?
I thought you saw him.
This is very weird for me.
You thought I saw him?
How am I...
- You' re going too fast.
Okay, slowly, slowly.
It' s very weird.
I was helping out a deaf uncle a few summers ago... but we didn' t have to hide it like this.
Oh, Jesus, this is great.
Val, you wanna go with this one tomorrow or the big one?
- Wow.
These are beautiful pocket watches.
- Thanks.
I would go with the big one.
Val, um, how' d you feel the first day went?
The first day was, you know, like the first day.
It was like a shakedown where you weed out the malcontents.
I' d love to speak to you for a few minutes if you' re not too busy and all.
- l- I...
- Well, sir, uh... you said you wanted me to show me that, uh, piece of jade?
- Jade?
- You know what?
If you have work to do... we' il do this some other time.
- Yes, I do. l- I...
- Okay.
Thank you.
Sorry, sir.
That' s all I could think of to extricate you.
You realize there' s no piece of jade.
Yes, I get it.
There' s no jade.
Hey, everything okay?
So far our conspiracy has gone undetected.
Perfect.
I' m taking you to your shrink right now.
Listen.
Same drill tomorrow, Chou.
Don' t worry.
I' il practice casual banter.
Very good.
Good.
Nice to see you.
To observe Val Waxman directing... one would think he has no idea what he' s doing.
I wonder if he is one of those cinema geniuses... who thrive on chaos, like Fellini.
He always seems distracted.
He never looks anyone in the eye... and must be juggling a million things in his mind at once.
It' s easy to see why his reputation is one of an eccentric.
I notice, too, as the weeks go by... what a great interest he has in the photography...

Sidney, Voice Over:
I started every interview
I' ve ever given the same way for over 10 years.
So, when did you fall in love with hip- hop?
I basically fell in love with hip- hop, you know what I' m saying, when cats first started going out to the parks, you know, with the 2 turntables, the mic.
I think it was 1977.
People are rocking in the parks.
I can remember back in the Bronx, 1979.
Set up some turntables in front of the building.
And we was getting the power from the street lamps outside.
Plug it up into the street pole.
MC- ing, DJJ- ing, b- boying, break- dancing.
Break- dancing or popping, beats or rhymes, you know.
I was in love with it.
Probably about 12 years old, man.
And I was watching Wild Style.
It was creative, it was new, it was fresh.
Breakin ', rappin', battlin '.
It was the whole culture, period.
The Bambaataa show, the Afrika Islam show.
It was just like our way of expression.
As soon as I got introduced to it.
I was gonna be dealing with hip- hop whether I wanted to or not.
Like a forced marriage, it was predetermined.
And I heard Eric B Is President, and then that kind of changed my life.
I heard The Message, Melle Mel.
There was a rapper named Eddie Cheeba who was one of the pioneers.
When I first heard Sugarhill Gang.
Rapper' s Delight.
Rapper' s Delight.
That set it off for rap music.
Funky Four Plus One More.
Plus One More, you know what I' m saying?
Furious Five, Freedom.
Run and them and Whoudini freestyling.
Sucka MC' s by Run- DMC.
Sucka MC' s live.
Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel.
Grandmaster Caz from the Cold Crush Brothers.
- Cold Crush.
- Cold Crush.
- Cold Crush.
- Grandmaster Flash.
Treacherous Three, Body Rock.
Spoonie Gee, Love Rap.
The first time I heard Rebel Without a Pause.
Eric B and Rakim.
EPMD and them.
I gotta say Public Enemy as a group... you know.
Classics, bangers.
I mean, to this day they' re bangers.
I just love what it sounded like, and I loved what he was saying.
You know, the whole slick tongue thing.
I felt like these dudes hit the truth.
Forget everything else you heard on the radio and all that.
This is it.
This is what I want to do.
I was in.
It was freedom.
I remember the exact day
I fell in love with hip- hop.
It was...
[Play At Your Own Risk By Planet Patrol Playing]
Yo, look, y' all!
Look what they doing over there!
[Men Rapping Indistinctly]
# The mic almost dropped but I catch quick #
# And from that point we get hectic #
# Now, I score the ladies, I score the boys #
# I am the one and only art of noise #
# What up, hear, hear? #
[Beatboxing]
# Dana Dane #
Girl, up here!
# When out of nowhere dropped this fiendish fiend #
# I want your shoes, your jewels, man, everything #
# Now in his hands, a knife, a gun #
# I' m thinking to myself #
# Should I fight or should I run? #
# I see his tool, slapped him up against the dome #
# Would you believe this fool #
# Tried to rob me with a comb? #
# Yo, Rick, my, my, #
# My mellow, my man #
# Get on the mic and rock this jam #
# Well, I was on the 41 bus #
# Reading the news #
# Here comes grandma #
# And she steps on my shoes #
# I smile, although I was quite disgusted #
# I said "What' s the matter, granny #
# Is your blind ass dusted? "#
The day I saw Slick Rick, who went by Ricky D back then,
Dana Dane, and Doug E. Fresh battle in the Bronx was the day I truly met hip- hop.
Little did I know a year later
Ricky D would would join the Get Fresh Crew and record the hip- hop classic The Show, and of course the b- side La Di Da Di.
Dana Dane would drop a couple years later with his classic Cinderfella.
[Beatboxing]
Hip- hop was as young, naive, confused, sometimes innocent, and sometimes as mischievous as I was.
And as I grew up...
- Later, Dre.
- Later, Sid.
Hip- hip grew with me, and along the way it took on all my baggage... my dreams.
I felt hip- hop, and hip- hop felt me.
And I know everyone who loves the music feels the same way I do.
You know this little party going on out here is for you.
I know.
I' il be out in a minute.
I know you can' t be working.
Today' s your last day.
It' s the book.
I got to turn in the pages by the end of the week.
Dre' s on the line.
You want me to put him through?
Yeah.
Put him through.
What' s up, baby?
Hey, what' s up, girl?
You knew I wasn' t about to let you leave without my ink, right?
I know you don' t have me on speaker, do you?
No, no.
I mean, yeah, but it' s just me.
So, what' s good?
Apologize first.
What happened?
Apologize first.
You know the routine.
Say it.
Uh, I' m sorry for being a self- centered, uh, ass.
Actually change that to "impatient, arrogant ass."
Ok, you can' t be adding extras here, Sid.
Tell me something.
Does Simon know you wet the bed till you were 12?
Ok, ok, I' m sorry for being a self- centered, arrogant...
No break- dancing.
You crazy, no, no, you...
No, I ain' t crossing that line.
Just say it, Dre.
I got your review in my hands.
I' il put it at the bottom of the stack.
Come on.
All right.
No break- dancing... no break- dancing ass who' s taking advantage of his friendship with the beautiful, smart, the giving hip- hop writer of The Los Angeles Times.
New editor of Double XL.
The new editor of Double XL for his personal professional advancement.
Are you happy now?
Mm- hmm.
Congratulations.
I think you' ve got another hit on your hands.
Thank you, Sid.
Couldn' t wait one week for the review to come out, huh?
So what' s the deal?
You gonna be home in time for Russell' s party?
Oh, look at you.
Like you' re on a first name basis with Russell Simmons.
Come on now, you know how I do it.
Yes, I' il be home for the DefJJam party.
My bags are packed.
Cool.
No, I cannot wait to see you, big time.
All right, girl.
Peace.
All right.
Bye, Dre.
For many people, hip- hop was that first friend.
The first to talk to us...
the first to understand.
Hip- hop has always been that kind of friend to me.
I' ve watched it grow.
I' ve watched it change.
# Who' s the one that can' t comprehend at first? #
[Song Becomes Indistinct]
Hey, Sid Shaw.
Hey, how you doing, Beanie?
Been trying, um...
What' s up?
I' m trying...
Me and my man Fab are trying to get at you for the longest.
What' s up with that cover?
I' m working on it.
Yo, for real?
Yeah, yeah, I got you.
Thirsty?
Girl, I worked a double shift at the restaurant to get this night off.
I' m about to have a ball.
You should, too.
I' m having fun.
[Both Giggle]
See?
See, this is why I don' t date.
Only guys I meet are in the industry, and they ain' t never got their shit together.
What, like him?
Ever thought you' d see the day hip- hop grew up?
Ha ha ha!
What' re you drinking, beautiful?
And a Ketel One martini up with a twist for the gentleman.
Get up off that chair and hug me, girl.
What' s up, baby?
I have missed you so much.
I missed you, too.
How you been?
Look at you.
There you are.
Oh, my God.
I got you, I got you.
Dre, stop it!
I can' t believe you left me over there with that man.
Don' t be mad.
Kiss me, kiss me.
Gimme a kiss, gimme a kiss.
Yes, that' s what I like.
Sidney here is somebody I want you to meet.
Oh, my God!
Sidney, Reese.
It' s so good to meet you.
Oh, my God!
I' ve heard so much about you.
Oh, well, I hope it wasn' t too bad.
No, and you look great.
But I can' t compete with you in that dress.
Oh, please, I think you are wearing that dress.
[Clears Throat]
Do you hear something, Sidney?
Ha ha ha ha!
That' s real funny.
Anyway, this is cute.
Y' all should take this little act on the road.
We' re just teasing you.
Oh, there' s Steve.
Sidney... good to meet you.
Ok.
Hurry up.
I love you.
I love you.
Mm- hmm.
Yeah, she' s pretty much amazing.
Mm- hmm.
That' s not a word I' ve heard you use to describe one of your women.
Oh, she ain' t like any of the others.
For real.
What' s up?
I want to show you something.
Is that what I think it is?
Yeah.
Think I' m gonna do it tonight, Sid.
- What?
- Uh- huh.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
But, Dre, you' ve known her for like 5 minutes.
I know, I know, but, um...
I...
I think she' s the one.
So I' m retiring the "Slow JJams Deluxe Get The Drawers" tape.
The "Slow JJams Deluxe Get The Drawers" tape?
Yeah.
The one with Luther, Sade, and the extended mix of Prince' s Adore, so...
Damn, it' s like that?
I' m for real.
What, why are you looking at me like that?
I don' t know.
We' re...
We' re grown- ups.
I' m so glad you' re here.
Oh, I' m happy to be here.
Ohh!
All right, I' m about to go in.
You' il be fine.
You' il be fine.
Trust yourself.
All right.
My breath tart?
No, you' re cool.
All right.
Here we go.
[Muffled]
Oh, my God!
Dre, oh, my God!
Yes, yes, yes!
# Was it good enough for you? #
Girl, I can' t believe you' ve been here damn near a month and you still not unpacked.
I' ve been busy.
I mean, there' s this little job I have at this little magazine.
Besides, there' s order in this chaos.
I know where everything is and where everything goes.
So, uh, where does this go?
Ooh!
It' s not what you think.
It' s a massager from Brookstone.
Oh, come on, Sid, like I don' t know...
It' s a massager!
Men take too much of your time.
Time I don' t have.
You' re turning into a Terry McMillian character.
Don' t say that, that' s cold!
I' m telling you you' re in trouble.
Oh, it' s just I never seem to find anyone on the same page with me.
What, like Dre?
Oh, here we go.
Come on.
You' re gonna tell me you never thought about hooking up?
I told him no.
No?!
What is wrong with you, girl?
I mean, we' ve been through everything together.
Exactly.
So if you two hook up, you get the best of both worlds.
You get the buddy and the booty.
I hear you, but relationships break up.
People get angry, they never want to talk to each other again.
I mean, you' re divorced.
Terrell was your ace, right?
You still talk to him?
Me and Terrell talk all the time.
We talk about alimony, we talk about that tramp...
And you know Dre.
He' s never been with a woman more than a month.
Yeah, well, looks like he' s gonna keep this one.
Guess so.
Ooh, she invited me to her bridal tea shower thingy, and I don' t know what to bring.
You haven' t changed a bit.
Want me to pick something up for you?
Oh, would you, would you?
I got you, cuz, I got you covered.
You' re the best cousin in the world.
So what do you want me to do with your massager?
[Both Laughing]
Sidney!
You made it!
Hi!
Hey.
Oh, thank you.
And we called her Reese' s pieces.
Ok, let' s move on to the groom.
I' il ask the same questions.
Fine.
Romulus.
What' d you say, Sidney?
You know the answer?
Romulus.
That' s right.
Ok, anyway...
Romulus is right.
What is Dre' s favorite drink?
- Cosmo.
- A polar bear.
Ketel One martini up with a twist, but if he' s trying to show off, Macallan 25.
Right again.
Macallan 25.
All right, then.
What is Dre' s favorite song?
Ok, Sid can' t play anymore.
Ok, let' s move on to something else.
This is from moi.
Oh, you guys, you guys!
Ooh!
Ohh!
Honeymoon night only.
I love you so much.
Ok, next, let' s do...
Sidney' s gift.
Thank you.
Such a sweetheart.
Nice.
Very nice.
[Women Laughing]
I' m gonna kill France!
And hungry.
I bet you were.
I mean, they didn' t have anything but those little cucumber sandwiches with the crust cut off.
Just keep the change.
You' re my dawg.
It' s good, huh?
Mmm!
I love these bad boys.
It' s true.
I can' t even front.
Whenever I go out with Reese, we always going to some fancy spot with white tablecloths and a lot of silverware, hosting one of Reese' s clients.
I haven' t had one of these bad boys since we started dating.
Wow.
She must really be something.
Mmhh.
Yeah, for sure.
She' s brown sugar.
Oh, yeah, the brown sugar.
Yeah.
Break it down for me.
You know, we all looking for wifey material.
A woman that' s fine, smart, classy, but not a snob.
You know, hella... hella sexy, but not a ho.
That' s brown sugar.
That' s my Reesey.
I mean, don' t get confused by her business suit.
She is a freak in the bedroom...
A little bit too much information.
Hey, I' m just letting you know.
Then on the converse side of things, you got the girls at the video shoots with their breasts all propped up and their booties hanging out of their dresses.
I like to refer to them as the Cyndi Lauper honeys.
They just like to have fun.
Don' t get it twisted.
I' il tap that as well.
Oh, I forgot being best friends with a man means I get to find out the stupid and simple ways they look at women.
Well, that' s how men are, stupid and simple.
See, that' s the problem with y' all women.
You...
You' re all too complicated.
You keep trying to change every man into the marrying type, and you just can' t do it.
Well, I guess Reese did a good number on you.
And tell me, then...
Dreski, what type am I?
You could probably be in a video.
- Do this.
- Dre...
- Do this.
- Dre!
[Huffs]
What do you think about this for the mantle?
That sounds so cool.
I never had a mantle before.
It' s cute.
It' s not really you, though.
Now this is tight.
Oh, couples love that piece because it' s not too masculine, it' s not too feminine.
I like to call it a compromising piece.
Let me guess.
Newlyweds, right?
No, we just...
Pu- lease, we are just friends, that' s it.
Oh, um, I' m sorry.
I just thought, um...
Mm- hmm.
Why you have to say it like that?
Say what?
Pu- lease.
Like I ain' t shit.
Oh, damn it, see.
I forgot.
What jail or group home does Simon have you going to now?
Oh, that' s funny.
It' s open mic night at Webster Hall.
What you doing tonight?
Oh, I can' t, Dre.
Aw, come on, Sid.
You remember how we used to do it.
Come on.
I can' t hang like that.
I gotta get up in the morning.
All right, we' il bump the eggs and bologna.
You can do it.
You got it in you.
What?
Hear the music.
Unh, unh, unh.
# No eggs, unh, unh, unh #
# No bologna, unh, unh, unh #
Ok.
Just dancing.
Ok, stop it!

Yeah, you look real anxious.
Tell me when he comes.
He' s right here.
What?
Hey, I' m Dre Ellis.
This is Sidney Shaw.
Hey.
Wondering if you were signed.
Uh, no, not right now.
Hey, you doing me dirt, man.
What' s the deal?
I see you.
Why don' t you take this man, give me a call.
You really rip it on stage.
I remember you, man.
You used to, um, you used to hang up posters for DefJJam.
Yeah.
Ha!
That' s right.
That was back in the day, that was back in the day.
Yeah, yeah.
Seriously, though, we' re trying to do some big things with you.
We' re looking for artists of your caliber.
What' s up?
You want to sign me for pennies and sell my publishing for millions?
Oh, that' s funny.
You got jokes.
For real, though, you' re looking for a deal, probably, right?
Why don' t you take...
Can I put this anywhere?
I' m not sure Millenium is really ready for what I' m doing.
It' s on a different tip, you know.
I' ve seen some of your artists.
No dis.
Oh, that' s cool, man.
We' re trying to, you know, broaden our horizons.
I' il get at you, man.
I know where Millenium at.
I know where the office is at.
Thanks for coming, man.
I' m glad you felt it, man, all right?
Yo, that was all right.
Ok.
There' s Dre.
Yo, that' s Dre.
Yo, yo.
Excuse me, Dre.
Dre, yo.
Yo, Dre.
Dre, we' re Ren and Ten.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What' s going on?
How you doing, brother?
My name is Ren...
No, no, we decided I' m Ren.
All right, whatever, man.
The Hip- hop Dalmatians, you understand what I' m saying?
Yo, you get it?
White with black spots.
You know what I' m saying?
Like, we represent that whole unity thing.
You know, like one unit.
U- N- l- T.
- Why?
- Because.
- Right.
- Thank you.
Now, let' s go.
I' m doing some talking about the schematics for the album cover, ok?
What we seeing is this.
I' m gonna be standing there, right, we gonna have 101 dalmatians around.
And I' m gonna have a white fur coat with black spots.
I' m gonna rock a black fur coat with white spots, you know what I' m saying?
- Boom.
Like, the audience, they like, "what?"
They don' t know.
'cause we do one thing, we go 160 degrees to the other side.
160 degrees?
Ren, Stimpy.
Stimpy?
Rin Tin Tin.
Dre:
Rin Tin Tin...
Rin...
What can I do for you?
All right, Dre... it' s Ren and Ten.
Hip- hop Dalmatians.
D- A- L- M- A...
Well, you know, "shens", man.
Ren:
No, he don' t know.
He don' t know, dun sun.
Let him know.
I' m gonna tell you, dun sun.
We your new group, dun sun!
Oh!
We just signed to Millenium yesterday!
- In your area.
Ren and Ten.
What' s that about?
What' s gonna happen now?
We' re gonna take it all over, you and me.
[Simon Chatting With Secretary]
Hey, Dre.
Thank you, baby.
Um, did you sign a new act without consulting me?
Dre, I saw 'em and I had to sign' em.
I had never seen no shit like that.
A black and white rapping duo.
I know they gonna hit.
Come on, man.
You know that' s just a gimmick.
They' re just straight up wack.
Now I saw, last night, a real MC.
This cat deserves a shot.
He came with the real original, real, real hip- hop.
I' m trying to sell records to people who' il actually buy them.
So I need a group who is gonna be able to get me that MTV rotation, baby.
Now, Ben and Ken...
Ren and Ten.
They the future, baby.
They' re gonna be like Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder, you know?
Paul McCartney and MichaelJJackson.
Whoo!
They can do a remake of The Girl Is Mine.
Hell, yeah!
See, that' s why I got you here.
Oh, that' s gonna be tight!
I' m gonna be able to call it, uh, uh, uh...
That Ho Is Mine.
The Ho Is Mine.
Are you serious?
Yeah, that' s tight.
You really want me to do this?
Well, if you want to work for Millenium Records.
That' s what we do here.
Now, you wanna keep it real, you go to Rawkus.
We keep it profitable.
Now, it' s too hard to do both of' em.
Now, listen, Dre... go on to your little bachelor party, marry that fine- ass woman of yours, and have a nice honeymoon.
When you get back, you gonna make it happen with Ren and Ten.
Hmm?
You hear what I' m saying?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Smart boy.
I' m coming.
What you doing here?
Aren' t you supposed to be at your bachelor party?
Yeah.
You know what?
I was thinking about yesterday... when I got my hat handed to me by that MC...
And I realized that I' m the character you' re writing on when you say that hip- hop has lost its way.
Dre, I was talking in general terms.
And I was ready, too.
You know, give them my high- minded speech and just bounce.
Then I started thinking about the money, upward mobility, the suits...
and I punked out.
You didn' t punk out.
Well, you gotta admit, I punked out a little bit.
Not even a little bite- sized,
"melt in your mouth, not in your hand" punk out?
Ok, maybe a tiny bite- sized punk out.
See?
Dre, we all sell out a little in our careers.
It' s how you survive the business.
Why did it all get so complicated?
I mean, all I wanted to do was make music, and now I' m not doing that.
All I' m doing now is making deals and 10% of them is shady.
All right, 30%.
Fine, 50%.
But you see what I' m saying?
Come here.
Come here.
You' il be all right.
Just trust yourself.
Do you remember when we saw
Get Fresh and The Kangol Crew?
How could I forget?
That was a good day.
I wish I could go back to that day.

He just looked at you like you had 3 breasts.
What happened?
Nothing.
Nothing happened.
Wait a second.
You boned him, didn' t you?
Shh!
No, I didn' t.
Oh, you little ho.
What you gonna do?
Nothing!
It was just a little kiss.
Tongue?
[Organist Plays The Wedding March]
Did you feel anything?
It was a mistake!
Mistake my ass.
She gonna marry your man.
Dre is not my man, he' s my friend.
That' s it, end of discussion.
Shh!
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.
You' re just gonna let it go down like that?
Do you Reese Marie Whigham...
Can we talk about this later?
Why?
You only think you' re friends?
That' s your man up there.
Francine, shut up!
Say something!... till death do you part?
I do.
Do you, Andre Romulus Ellis, take Reese Marie Whigham...
You' re seriously gonna let her marry him?
Yes!
France!... to hold in sickness and in health, for richer, for poorer, till death do you part?

He don' t mean that.
The rings.
Say something.

That' s your man up there.
Francine, shut up!
- Say something then.
- Shh!
I now pronounce you...
Husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
I can' t believe it.
I present to you,
Mr. And Mrs. Andre Ellis!
The union of hip- hop to the mainstream was a hard thing to imagine.
Hip- hop was always this personal, regional thing that belonged to just me.
Starting with Fab 5 Freddie and Yo.!
MTVRaps.!
Anyone with a television set and cable box could get a piece of hip- hop.
I knew I was gonna have to share, and that was hard to get used to.
# One shot to your heart without breaking your skin #
# No one has the power #
# To hurt you like your kin #
# Kept it inside, didn' t tell no one else #
# Didn' t even wanna admit it to yourself #
# And now it just burns and your back aches #
# From 15 years of holding the pain #
# And now you only have yourself to blame #
# If you continue to live this way #
# Get it together #
# Get it together #
Yeah, not next Wednesday, but the Wednesday after.
Ok, looking forward to it.
Hot 97 called again.
They still want you to come in for an interview.
Tell 'em I can' t do it right now.
It works with our next issue.
Great, when can we get an interview?
Tomorrow night.
The Nets are playing the Knicks on Wednesday, so if you' re free...
Mm- mmm.
Get Rashad to do it.
Well, here' s the thing.
[Sighs]
Look, you need to catch a man, but you not dangling the right bait.
I look fine.
You dangle enough for the both of us.
Ok, now look, I know you don' t want to make that little friend of yours jealous, but you need the real thing.
It' s a massager from Brookstone.
Whatever you want to call it.
Listen, you got to go inside,
Katrina' s gonna hook your hair up, then we gonna get you some real clothes so you look incredible for your date with Kelby Dawson tonight.
I' m meeting Kelby on business.
This isn' t a date.
But it' s an opportunity, so you gotta dangle.
I' m not gonna dangle.
All right, all right.
He' s here.
No.
No, I' m not.
They' re dangling enough already.
Bye.
Sidney Shaw.
How are you?
Good.
How you doing?
Good.
Kelby Dawson.
I' m sorry I' m so late.
And thanks for the drink.
How' d you know I like Perfect 10s?
I' ve got my sources.
Well, thanks for giving us this interview, especially considering you don' t do much press.
Well, yeah.
I don' t know too many professional athletes that avoid the spotlight.
I thought all you guys wore diamonds in each ear, minks, and did the cabbage patch in the camera after you make a free throw.
The cabb... that' s funny.
But you' re wrong about the mink.
Hi!
So, Perfect 10, huh?
I' ve never tasted one.
Hey, y' all.
Talk to you later.
What' s up?
Hey, Dre.
How you doing?
Hi.
I didn' t even recognize you.
You look so amazing.
You look nice.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It' s been a while.
How you been?
Good.
You know, I just...
You know, settling into the new gig.
How was the honeymoon?
Oh, wow.
Oh, it was nice.
Thanks for asking.
[Clears Throat]
This is Kelby.
What' s up?
Dre Ellis, big fan.
You' re over at I MG, right?
We gotta bust.
Aren' t you gonna introduce your friends?
Dalmatian.
Yo, check it!

These cats are Ren and Ten, a new act we just signed at Millenium.
Well, congratulations.
Ren and Ten, The Hip- hop Dalmatians.
Word, y' all, we represent that whole unity thing.
You know what I' m saying?
Black and white.
Yo, one love, brother.
All right.
Yeah, we' re, uh, celebrating the fact that they came on to the label.
They' re clients of Reese' s.
They' re the real deal, Sid.
Good to see y' all.
Come on.
[Chuckles]
To the left, fellas.
Good- bye.
That' s...
That' s your ex, huh?
Dre?
Uh- uh.
No, that' s my boy.
We grew up together.
It' s nothing like that.
Really?
Hmm...
Anyway, we' re here to talk about you.
[Instrumental Music Plays]
Ten:
# What?
What?
What? #
# Hey, yo, Ren #
# Yo, what' s up, Ten? #
# Yo, yo, yo, Big C told me you was at the club #
# Pushing up on one of my hos #
# Yo, yo, yo, Yolanda? #
# Yeah, Yolanda #
# Man, that ho is a ho! #
# Man, you still mess with that? #
# She may be a ho, but she' s my ho, you know? #
# The ho is mine #
# You gotta get that bitch #
# The ho is mine #
# You gotta get her #
# You gotta soothe that itch #
# I' m first in line #
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What you doin '?
What the fuck is that?
Yo, man!
Yo, we just trying to put some flavor on the track, you know, son?
An ill kind of intro like the breakdown they got on The Girl Is Mine.
Real hip- hop, dawg.
Dalmatian style.
Yeah, Ken.
That' s a good idea, guys.
- A' ight.
- Feel me.
That' s not a good...
That' s not a good idea.
That' s a bad idea.
It' s ridiculously wack.
Just like this whole outfit is ridiculous!
Dre, didn' t we already have a talk about this?
Hmm?
Yeah, man.
Yeah, man, we did.
[Together]
# Mine #
You go...
You go up. - # I # - # I #

Whatcha doin '?
Where you going, man?
Where you going?
I' m out, man.
Oh, come on now, Dre.
Whatcha doin ', man?
Dre.
- Peace.
- Where you going?
Dre.
Be out, then.
Wasting all my damn money.
All right, uh... go back to the top from that first ho.
How do you work this damn board?
[Car Horn Honking]
Where to?
Uh, Fort Greene.
Driver:
You want me to take the Manhattan or the Brooklyn?
I don' t care, man.
Just get me there, please.
Sidney Shaw.
The name cannot be recognized.
Sidney Shaw.
The name cannot be recognized.
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
Huh?
Do I know you?
Oh, JJesus.
Remember me, man?
The world is small as hell, ain' t it?
Yeah, man.
What happened, man?
That Menudo reunion deal fell through?
You got jokes, don' t you?
What you doing driving a cab anyway?
Your English is too good.
Trying to stay out of trouble is what I' m doing.
What' s up with you?
What' s going with Millenium?
I left Millenium today.
What?
Yeah.
What, so Simon owe you some money or something?
Uh, no.
Nothing like that.
You know what, this whole taxicab confession thing, we don' t really got to do.
If you could just keep driving?
Hey, not a problem.
Pardon me.
Not a problem at all.
He try to steal your girl or something?
No, man!
I' m married.
Ain' t nobody giving it to my wife but me.
I feel you.
You want to know why I left Millenium?
Sure.
Sure, whatever.
Man...
'cause I was tired of making bullshit and calling it hip- hop, man.
I was just tired.
I feel you.
I couldn' t take it no more.
Hey, man...
I had to bounce.
That' s tight, man.
I respect that.
You respect that?
[Laughing]
It' s like the Grinch who stole hip- hop growing a heart.
You got a grown- up heart now.
You gonna go back to Whoville and give all the hip- hop Whos their publishing back?
That' s funny to you?
I' m just playin 'with you, man.
Pull the cab over.
What, you don' t want to go to Brooklyn no more?
You hurt my feelings.
No, bro, I was just playing, man.
Don' t take it like that.
Keep the change, man.
Thank you, bro.
Hey, listen, man, don' t let that shit get you down, man.
Stay black, man!

# Make you feel that way #

# Make you feel that way #
# Up and early for the hope of a brand new day #
# See a homie you ain' t seen since back in the day #
# Fresh haircut fitted wit a fat ass fade #

# How you felt when you first heard the Daddy Kane #
# Rakim, KRS, hey I had that tape #
Sid?
Excuse me?
Yeah, can I get you to sign this for me?
Thank you.
Thanks.
What' s up, baby?
Can you believe this?
Oh, my goodness.
They' re from Kelby.
You must give good interviews.
He wants a date.
Yes, he does.
Now, see I would' ve just written you a little note that said, "Will you go out with me?"
With a "Yes" box, "No" box, and a "Maybe" box.
Yeah, you' ve always been such a romantic.
You, uh... you got a minute?
Yeah.
What' s going on?
All right, how about this one?
Ok, ok, ok.
# Yes, yes, y' all, and you don' t stop #
# And 1, 2, Common says the beat' s a sure shot #
It' s common sense.
I Used To Love H. E. R.
You said his name.
It' s one of the tightest cuts of all time.
# I met this girl when I was 10 years old #
# And what I loved most she has so much soul #
# She was old school, when I was just a shorty #
# Never knew throughout my life #
# She would be there for me #
Yeah, man.
See, that' s why I write and don' t rap.
For real.
That song reminded me of us.
It does?
Yeah, back in the day.
Do you remember that feeling?
Especially back then.
It was so real.
It was like air.
Do you remember how you felt the first time you heard
The Bridge Is Over?
The first time?
Yup.
You Gots To Chill.
The sophomore skate party?
Bonita Applebum.
That was a tight one.
Ooh, I used to loved that.
See, now that beat was tight.
The Beastie Boys.
Yeah, man, they came with it.
Mm- hmm.
You know...
I don' t have that feeling no more.
You know what I' m saying?
I had that feeling.
I can' t...
You ready to talk?
What' s on your mind?
I quit today, Sid.
I left Millenium.
I just walked away from it all today.
So, whatcha gonna do now?
I' m thinking...
I' m thinking I could start my own label.
You know?
Yeah.
Um, you know, make music that I want to make.
Music that I think should be out there.
You know what I mean?
Bring on artists and treat 'em like partners.
Shoot.
Be one of the good guys for a change.
You think I' m crazy?
I think you' re the bomb.
For real?
I think you' re the bomb.
- For real- real?
- Yes.
That' s great, Dre.
I can already see us at the Grammys, basking in your success.
Oh, I like how that sounds.
The Grammys.
Damn, Dre, that' s great.
I' m scared, Sid.
You got the money?
Uh, I mean, I got a little something...
A little something saved.
I' m gonna have to hit up other sources, but... you know, I ain' t gonna really stress about that.
I need to be worrying about now.
I' m gonna start out with one artist...
What you doing?
You just found another source.
Sid, stop playing.
I ain' t...
Take it.
No, I' m not taking that money from you.
Come on.
Look, you are my best friend.
There' s nobody that believes in you more than me.
[Church Bell Chiming]
Ow!
I can' t believe you sometimes.
So what you doing tonight?
We gonna celebrate or what?
I can' t, I have...
I have a date.
Oh, with Kelby?
Yeah.
So you said yes, huh?
'cause you hanging with me tonight.
- Uh- uh.
- For real.
I got to go.
It' s like that?
Just put the money on the nightstand and bounce?
Leave a brother hanging?
Bye, Dre.
No kissing on the first date.
Bye, Dre.
Just when you think you know everything there is to know about hip- hop it finds a way to surprise you and remind you why you fell in love in the first place.
Good evening, Miss Shaw.
Welcome to Chingalle' s.
How' d you know my name?
Oh, my goodness.
Thank you.
Thank you, Jarmelle.
Perfect 10s.
[Laughs]
Thank you.
I' il be right back.
Ok.
Hey, Reesey- piecey.
Hi, baby.
How you doing?
How was your day?
Interesting.
Oh.
I forgot.
I took your phone again.
Oh!
Yeah, I know.
I kept getting phone calls from all your ex- girlfriends.
Here.
Thank you, baby.
Baby...
Mmm?
Mmm...
I love you... and, uh, ahem...
I quit my job today.
Why?
I needed to.
I had to.
L...
I' m gonna start my own label.
I' m gonna do all the things that I' ve ever wanted to do.
I thought you were doing all of that at Millenium.
No, not at Millenium.
I wasn' t.
I mean, you know how much I love music, how much I love hip- hop,
And I lost that love at Millenium.
How could you make a change like this without consulting me?
Plus, I know you would' ve just tried to talk me out of it, and...
It' s not fair for you to assume that.
- You don' t know that.
- Reese, you mean to tell me, had I told you, you wouldn' t have tried to talk me out of it?
Yes, I would have tried to talk you out of it, but I' m supposed to do that.
You get so excited, and you don' t think straight, and then you do something like this.
You can' t make a major life decision just because you feel like it...
I don' t need you to be my lawyer!
And a wife supports her husband!
Baby, I need your support!
Ok, fine.
I support you.
I' il call some money people.
Uh...
Sid said she' d help out with some of the investing, and...
Sidney?
Sidney knew about this before me?
Reesey, baby, please, you know she' s my friend...
[Claps]
Ok.
- Damn, Dre.
- Reese.
Well, I see you have it all under control.
I' m really happy for you.
Who, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow your roll.
Reesey!
Reese!
No, you slow your roll.
Reese!
Dre?
You did all right.
So...
So, you' re used to guys closing down restaurants on their busiest nights, huh?
Commandeering the kitchen, serving you like a queen.
You' re used to all that, huh?
- You ballplayers.
- All right.
I didn' t think so.
You think you' re gonna get some booty, don' t you?
Well, yeah.
- [Laughs]
One of these days.
Come on, that' s what this is all about.
You know, the dating, the awkward walks home.
That' s what men and women do.
You got it all figured out, don' t you?
[Sighs]
You put a man and a woman together long enough, and... something' s gonna go down.
Well, what makes you think you gonna be around long enough for something to go down?
Well, I think I got a pretty good shot.
Especially outside 20 feet.
And you could work on that D a little, too.
- Oh, really?
- Really.
Ok.
Come here.
How was that shot?
Nothin 'but net.
Vichon.
Chris Vichon.
V- l- C- H- O- N.
He' s a driver.
No, no, it' s not a complaint.
He' s a driver.
Never mind.
Thank you for your time.
Hello?
Whassup?
- Who is this?
- It' s Dre.
Dre?
You do realize the hour, right?
Well, why you whispering?
Shh!
Quiet.
How was the date?
- Good.
- "Good" like,
"I had a great time, but I gotta go" or "good" like,
"I' m gonna stay for dessert"?
Good like, I' il have dessert, a walk along the promenade, coffee, which I' m making now.
Sidney!
Is he still there?
- Mm- hmm.
- Damn!
You must like him a lot.
Dre, the man cooked for me.
So?
I cooked for you.
Burnt fried bologna and eggs hardly qualifies as cooking.
I' m sayin ', though, did you actually see him cook for you?
You actually saw me cook for you.
Did you actually see him cook for you?
- Tsk... he' s runnin 'game on you.
That nigger ain' t cook for you!
Dre, why would he say it if he didn' t?
So he could get you to make him coffee in the middle of the night so he could tap that.
I know these things.
Well, his game worked.
Ohh!
Sidney!
For real?
Is y' all gonna do it?
Bye, Dre.
- Sidney!
- Bye.
Sid!
Sidney!
Sidney!
There you go.
Thank you.
[Chuckles]
- This is good coffee.
- Mmm.
This is really good.
Yeah, I, uh...
I got it from Balducci' s.
Mmm.
Ahem.
Let' s have sex now.
Excuse me, sir.
I' m looking for a, uh, Chris Vichon.
- Does he...
- Right there.
- Oh, ok.
Thank you.
[Chris Singing]
What' s up, partner?
What' s up, man?
What you doin 'here?
Uh... actually, I, um...
I' m, uh, ahem...
I' m startin 'my own label, and, uh, somebody told me that this real nice MC works here.
You know him?
What you want, Grinch?
What you want me to do, some Mother Goose raps?
"There was an old ho that lived in a shoe."
No, I ain' t lookin 'for that no more, man.
I' m lookin 'for some real stuff.
I don' t get you, man.
One day you all shiny- suited up, then the next day, you head to the garage lookin 'for the raw shit.
Well, what you got goin 'on, man?
What?
You waitin 'for some label to come and scoop you?
What' s your hook?
See, that' s the difference between me and you, dog.
I don' t need no hook.
My skills is my hook.
You' re an MC that drives a cab.
A taxicab!
Let me tell you something.
First of all, I got a job.
I didn' t come to Millenium askin 'you for shit.
Hey, man, I got a job, too, all right?
But I ain' t too proud to ask for help.
Maybe you should be more proud.
'Cause your rep is like this.
Come on, man, I know you was comin 'down here to do it, man.
You just signed the hip- hop cartoon puppies.
You think you could rap with me?
Spotted dalmatian, Smothers Brothers dudes.
What am I supposed to trust you for?
All right, man.
You got me.
All I know is I' m here, man, all right?
All I can give you is my word.
I' m tryin 'to do something real.
The way I see it, real MC' ing, that' s the hook.
That could be our hook.
That' s my vision.
All right?
No shiny suits, no bling- bling, no spotted furs.
This is the real deal.
On the humble?
I need you, man.
You want...
You wanna help me?
Yeah, man.
You really wanna help me do something?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Hold this.
Take this.
Hook up my back seat.
All right, I' m gonna just...
I' m gonna get you some coffee.
How long is it gonna take you to clean the back seat?
Oh, you...
You want me to clean the back seat?
I mean, if it' s too gully for you, it' s all good.
No, no, no, no!
No.
I mean, yo, I' m gully.
- Oh, yeah, you gully?
- Yeah!
I don' t want you to mess up your nails or nothin ', you know what I mean?
I' m gully, man.
I do something for you, right?
That' s how it goes, man.
- Right?
- I' m gully.
All right.
You find any change back there, it' s mine, ok?
Cool.
I got you.
All right, open a window so you don' t breathe that stuff in.
I' m gonna open up a window.
Gully.
I' il talk to you.
- Give me a call.
- I will.
- I promise.
- All right.
See you.
Look at you!
Good to see you.
Hey, Reese.
Sidney, hi!
Hey, how you doing?
I never see you in here.
Well...
I' ve had a lot more free time.
So I guess I actually have you to thank for bringing me back to class.
- Me?
- Yeah.
You know?
[Whistle Blows]
All right, everybody, listen up.
We' re just about ready to go.
I want you to find a partner, grab a pair of focus mitts.
We' re gonna do some punch combos.
[Whistle Blows]
Oh, thanks.
I' m already working with my man right here.
Just you and me.
Whoa.
Ohh!
You ok, Reese?
Oh, yeah, I' m fine.
I' m just...
I' m...
- [Laughs]
I' m just... thankin 'you.
[Laughs]
We' re both big girls.
Let' s let it out.
You have a problem with me and my friendship with Dre?
No, I don' t have a problem with your friendship with Dre.
I have a problem... that you' re in love with Dre.
What?
It' s understandable.
Dre' s an incredible man.
Listen, me and Dre have been through a lot together.
[Whistle Blows]
Friend, brother, whatever.
He...
I have to... beg for... you already know!
[Whistle Blows]
I realize my friendship with Dre may make things awkward... but I am not gonna apologize for it!
I don' t want you to apologize for it!
That' s not what I' m saying.
I knew you were friends with Dre when we got married, but this is not what I expected.
This was not part of our plan.
I never see him any... more... because of this... record label thing!
like it' s a hobby or a distraction.
This label is more than just a thing to him!
Well, you know, like I said, I guess... you know him better than I do.

All:
Whoo!
Yeah!
All right, y' all.
I got something to say.
I would like to propose a toast.
Man:
Yeah.
Yeah, but we won' t hold you sis- sponsible.
Anyway, this has been a hell of a year, as all of y' all know, full of ups and downs.
Um... for one, I married this beautiful young woman beside me... mmm...
But I also lost my job at Millenium.
No, no, bruh, the job lost you.
That' s right!
Yeah, ok, I like that.
I, um...
That took a lot of courage.
Thank you.
I would like to thank all of y' all for all of y' all' s support during this, uh... this time.
like to thank my best friend, who, uh, left that 75- degree weather to come back home.
You are the perfect verse over a tight beat.
And to the new year!
Yeah!
To the new year.
- Hippy- hip- hip!
- Yeah!
Yeah, yeah!
Ok.
Yeah!
Excuse me.
I' d like to... excuse me.
I' m sorry.
I' d like to take this to another level.
Ok, bruh, could we just stop at the food level real quick, though?
Let me just do this...
And then we' il eat.
Thank you.
All right.
One, uh... one second, please?
Let me take this.
Ahem.
- Man:
- Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, shit, we ain' t never gonna eat now.
I love you so much.
Would you do me the honor of being my wife?
I don' t...
I don' t know what to say.
Say yes.
Yes.
All right!
Yeah!
Yes.
So, what is the difference between rap and hip- hop?
It' s simple.
It' s like the difference between saying you love somebody and being in love with somebody.
Rap is just a word.
Um, what are you doin '?
Gettin 'more to drink.
You know what I' m talkin 'about.
Gettin 'into this whole... marriage thing.
Don' t you think this is just a little too fast?
You' ve only known the cat for a couple months.
About as long as you knew Reese before you got married.
That' s why you doing this?
This whole competition thing?
What, I marry Reese and you marry Sasquatch?
Oh, so now I' m doing this' cause of you?
You really on your own sack right now.
So I guess since I can' t marry you, I' m marrying Kelby.
No, no, no, no!
No, that' s not what I meant.
No.
Hey...
Sid, that' s not what I meant.
Sid, don' t...
Sid!
Sidney!
You need to talk to your friend.
What y' all goin 'through?
Ahh, here we go.
Hey...
Hey.
Hey.
What you doing?
Just gettin 'these champagne flutes.
Yeah, that' s funny.
[Laughs]
No, I never really thought about it.
Oh, shoot!
[Laughs]
If you find out, get back to me and let me know.
I will.
Hey, that' s a nice outfit.
And the food was tight, too.
It was tasty and nutritious.
Oh, shit.
Tasty and nutritious.
Oh!
- Hey.
- Hey!
Hey, what' s goin 'on?
Congratulations, man.
It' s a big move.
Good luck to you, man.
I' ve been meaning to talk to you about my album, man.
About my album, you know?
- Your album?
- Yeah.
Oh...
It' s so hard to get respect as an MC when you' re a ballplayer.
Right, right.
Rappers who play sports.
Yeah.
Yes.
Same thing.
But I was thinking, you could be my mentor.
Right.
You know what I' m sayin '?
- Yeah.
- Like, you could help me with my lyrics.
You could work it out so my... my... my lyrics get tight.
Tight.
Tight lyrics.
Right.
like a rap coach.
like a rap coach!
- Like, exactly!
# New Year' s Eve #
# Kelby D in the venue #
# Popped the ring #
# Got marriage on my menu #
Marriage on my menu, man!
That' s tight.
It' s not just basketball with you.
- Yo.
Yo!
- Dre?
Dre!
Dre?
Anybody seen Dre?
Yo, you got a number?
Hey, you all right?
Come over here real quick.
Hey, uh, what' s up with, uh, Sidney' s homegirl?
Sidney... oh.
Francine?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
She' s cool.
You feelin 'her?
He was all nervous, though.
[Laughs]
Called my food delicious and nutritious.
He did?
We was talkin 'a little bit, you know what I' m sayin'?
You slick dog!
You feelin 'her, man!
So spit at her, man!
She' s real cool.
No, no, no, no!
That' s what I' m sayin ', you know.
I don' t wanna just, you know, overwhelm her with all my game, you know?
I wanna conserve my game.
I don' t wanna just blow it all on one shot...
You ever notice how when a guy' s tryin 'to mack you, his voice either go real high
- Or real low?
- Mm- hmm!
Chris.
If you' re scared, just tell me you scared.
We cool!
I' m not scared.
I' m not scared.
Listen, if you' re scared of women...
Whoa, whoa!
Ooh, bro, why you talkin 'all loud, man?
This is how rumors get started.
What' s wrong with you, man?
So, you gonna give him any play?
I don' t know.
He kind of young.
First of all, I ain' t scared of women, but I ain' t like you.
Ok?
I ain' t the black male model.
I don' t be in the gym at all times.
Forget it, man.
Don' t even say nothin ', man.
I got you.
Let' s go.
You gonna hook me up, man?
Don' t play me, man.
[Laughing]
Got marriage on my menu!
Kelby?
You know what I think?
You should hire a lawyer to negotiate your contract.
You serious?
Yeah, I mean, why pay an agent 4% to negotiate numbers that are already set by a salary base cap?
Dre, don' t say anything.
Quit while we still have a friendship.
Hey, that' s what I' m tryin 'to do right now.
I' m trying to save our friendship.
I' m worried about you.
- Worried about me?
- Yeah!
You need to stop worrying about me and worry about your own marriage.
So you' re... excuse me.
I' m supposed to hire, right?
- Yeah!
- [Laughs]
My marriage?
What you mean?
What' s that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Sidney.
What' s that supposed to mean?
Maybe this is not the best place...
The best time to talk business, but I' m sure we' il have plenty of opportunity since our spouses are best friends.
Best friends.
They' re so close.
Yeah, well, how... how do you feel with them being so close?
Well, let' s just say it' s very hard to get used to.
Sidney, what did you mean?!
Sid...
Can we just drop this already?
Tell...
Tell me what you meant.
No!
You said...
- Nothing.
Just... tell me.
All right.
Nothing.
It' s nothing.
It' s just I...
I' ve been seeing her at the gym a lot lately, and... [sighs] a lot of guys try and run game on her, and, I don' t know, she don' t seem to mind.
Hmm.
All right?
She flirts...
She flirts a lot.
And she' s flirted with me.
I' m cool with that.
She flirt.
Ok.
That' s what I thought.
You' re probably right.
It' s when you talk like that, that' s what makes me think that you' re jealous.
- What?!
- Yes.
Jealous!
No wonder you two are married.
You' re both crazy!
I don' t spend my nights thinkin 'about you, ok?!
I got a man who' s fine, intelligent, successful, and gives it to me on a very, very regular basis, and the shit is the bomb!
So?
I don' t care what...
Dre, I need you to be happy for me.
I need you to be there for me, just like you asked of me.
[Laughing]
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
Ahem.
You' re upset.
I' m sorry.
I' m, uh...
I' m, uh...
I' m happy for you.
I' m happy for you, just like you was happy for me.
All right?
Cool?
All right, can I get a hug?
Good friends.
You tore up those cookies.
# Oo- ooh #
# Ooh #
# Oo- ooh #
# Ooh #
# Ooh... ooh #
# Oo- ooh #
# Ooh #
Nice shot.
Hey, beautiful.
Hey.
Mmm... what you got there?
I, uh... wanted us to make the final decision on these invites.
All right.
Well, whatever you want is cool with me.
It' s all you.
What' s wrong?
Oh.
I mean, writin 'these articles here and there is one thing, but... this book is different.
I really want it to be good, you know?
And, uh...
I don' t know if I can write at that level.
Of course you can!
Can I ask you something?
Yeah.
What did you think of the underground review
I wrote on Cassius in last month' s issue?
That was good.
That was really good.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What was good about it?
You know, everything.
Yeah, the whole... the whole thing was great.
It was really good.
You didn' t read it, did you?
Um... what about the one before that?
[Laughs]
Hey, I' m sorry.
Look...
Look...
I' ve been on the road.
You know how it goes.
Look, I promise I will read every article you' ve ever written in your life.
Everything.
Like your essays, your little love letters, everything.
Ok?
Every single thing.
- [Buzzer]
All right, I gotta go, Ms. Dawson.
[Music Playing]
So, this is where my money' s going?
[Cell Phone Rings]
Richard?
Who' s Richard?
Yo, Chris.
What' s up?
You got your cab with you?
Wait a minute.
Dre.
Dre.
Oh, no.
That guy goes to our gym.
Dre, think about this, ok?
Let' s just go.
Dre, you don' t want to do this.
What' s up?
Surprise!
Reesey, what...
Huh... you...
How... are you doin '?
- Hey...
- Hey... guys, what' s up?
How are you doin '?
Ha ha... it' s funny runnin 'into you here, singing love songs to each other.
Dre...
Don' t stop on my account.
Oh, Dre...
Me and Sid, we was just in the neighborhood.
We thought...
You mind if we join you?
Not at all.
Have a seat, man.
Right.
Sit down, girl.
Why you all stiff?
Reesey...
I see you got on my... favorite dress with this area all, like, "hey."
Greased up for my man.
I' m sorry.
Dre Ellis.
You are?
Richard Lawson.
Richard Lawson.
All right.
You sound educated.
I, um... you guys, um, friends of Reese' s?
Yeah, well, actually, the funny thing is, she' s my wife.
Oh...
Iook, hey, I' m sorry.
I didn' t...
That' s cool.
That' s cool.
How could you know?
She ain' t wearing the $15, 000 ring that I bought her ass.
I' m still paying it off, but you understand.
Could you not put my business out on the street?
Will you be joining us for dinner?
Listen, my man...
You know what?
We were just about to leave.
I' m trying to order the most expensive bottle of champagne, 'cause we fixin' to celebrate.
Dre.
[Taps Spoon On Glass]
And some pork chops.
Dre, come on.
'Cause I' m kind of hungry.
All right?
You' re making a scene.
Good.
I want to make a scene.
You know what I' m sayin '?
Bye- bye, Richard Lawson.
This is so embarrassing.
I can' t believe you got me to do that.
Hey, stop complaining.
You forget it was me who helped you
let all the air out of Shawn' s tires when he asked Angie to the homecoming dance instead of you.
Key word: home... coming.
High school.
We' re almost 30 years old, Dre.
Oh, time is a bitch.
I swear, I still feel like we' re just those 2 kids pop- locking at the block parties.
You remember my first little beat machine?
Boy, you thought you were D- Nice.
[Clears Throat]
"Simplicity provides
That' s a dope line.
And I know LL didn' t think he was that deep.
That was my first published article.
I went out, got the L. A. Times, every Wednesday, for your column.
I' d go to the park and read it.
I don' t know, it just... made me feel closer to you.
Uh... you want anything?
Coffee?
- Vodka?
- Uh, no.
I wanted them pork chops.
I told you we should have stayed for dinner.
How can you... joke about this?
Ha ha!
Sid, I do not know.
I guess I' il break down later.
I...
I' m glad I know now.
I guess I always knew deep down inside that we weren' t meant to be together.
Mm.
And when did you figure that out?
The night before the wedding.
Something happened between me leaving the house... and, uh... getting to the wedding.
'cause, damn, I had a beautiful woman that loved me to death.
'cause not everybody can marry their one true love.
It was a pretty difficult situation.
Do you, uh... you know anybody like that?
No, I don' t.
No?
But...
I do know somebody that was friends with this guy a long time, and... she thought maybe it was more than just... friends, but... something happened to her, coincidentally, before your wedding.
And... she realized it was nothing more than just friends.
Nothing?
Nothing.
Just friends?
Just friends.
I can' t believe what just happened.
I know.
I don' t know what to say.
I mean, usually I' m like the Energizer Bunny.
You know.
I keep goin 'and goin'...
I was talking about us... doing it.
This was bad.
We made a huge mistake.
Honey, I said I was sorry.
I mean, next time I won' t be so caught off- guard.
I' il use a little ginseng.
There isn' t gonna be a next time.
Don' t you get it?
This was bad.
Real, real bad.
It couldn' t have been that bad.
Dre, I' m not talking about that.
I' m getting married.
And we... we just got busy.
Where are my shoes?
They' re downstairs.
Wait.
Where you goin '?
I need to get myself together.
I have to meet Kelby after the game.
You' re not gonna tell him, are you?
What are you gonna tell him?
Are you gonna tell him?
I don' t know.
I...
I' m...
He doesn' t know what happened and I want to keep it that way.
Well, you' re not gonna... are you still gonna marry this cat after what we just had?
Dre... what just happened was the most... amazing... most fulfilling... most exhilarating... 5 minutes I' ve ever had in my life.
- 7.
- 10 minutes.
- 9?
- Ok.
8.
Whatever.
The point is, what do we do now?
We can' t just go back to the way things were.
Wait, wait.
What are you saying?
I need space.
Us staying so close, spending so much time together, just confuses things for me right now.
And besides, we wouldn' t even be here if it wasn' t for you catching Reese.
Why are you talking like that?
Why does it have to be all or nothing?
[Overlapping Conversations]
[Overlapping Conversations]
I know you know what you' re doing.
But, you know, when you go in there, just, you know, be firm with them, you know what I' m sayin '?
Yeah.
Don' t punk out like you did with Sidney.
Just... you stand your ground.
I never punk out with Sidney.
You did.
All I did was respect her wishes.
Sound like some punk logic right there.
How you figure?
What about Francine?
You were feeling her, right?
Yeah.
You ain' t doin 'nothin' about it.
I' m not... the Humphrey Bogart in this.
I' m the Peter Lorre.
I' m the sidekick character.
You the Humphrey Bogart.
You had your opening.
You know what I' m saying?
She wanted you to stop her from marrying the old dude, but you let it ride, you know?
Same thing Bogey did, man.
You' re the same dude.
Man, don' t be dissin 'Humphrey Bogart, man.
Why not?
'Cause he' s Humphrey Bogart.
He' s the man.
Yo, he was fightin 'a war.
That' s what they did back then.
You know what he needed to do back then?
And then, he gonna walk off in the fog with some other dude.
Come on, man.
With another dude, in the fog?
Come on.
2 grown men walk off in a fog, you don' t know where they goin '?
Think about it, man.
You smoke too much grass, man.
I hope you don' t think you walkin 'off noplace with me, man.
Matter of fact, let me sit over here.
Don' t fight it.
I' m not here with him.
I came by myself.
I' m a solo artist.
Security.
A' ight, we got a new joint for y' all.
I want you to check this out.
New Millenium recording artists Ren and Ten.
Ten, Rapping:
# Hey, yo, Ren #
Ren:
# Yo, what' s up, Ten? #
# Big C told me you was at the club #
# Pushin 'up on one of my hos #
# Yo, yo, yo, Yolanda? #
# Yeah, Yolanda #
# Man, that ho is a ho #
# You still mess with that? #
# She may be a ho, but she' s my ho, you know? #
[Singing]
# The ho is mine #
# You gotta get that bitch #
# That ho is mine... #
Trish will see you now.
Wow.
Ten and Ren:
# Mine #
But not before.
Come on, now.
Thank you for your time, Trish.
I' m from Brown Sugar Records.
As you know, I' m Dre...
Uh- huh.
And thanks for coming by.
Ok.
Thank you for coming by.
How many?
I don' t think so.
Hey.
What the hell is this?
I said to give me space and then you pull this stuff?
What...
What are you talkin 'about?
Guess what demo I heard for our unsigned underground review today.
Are you serious?
Dre, don' t act like you didn' t plan this.
You know the editor does the unsigned reviews.
Why would I need to plan?
I could have just given it to you at any time.
'cause the shit' s tight, not' cause I know you.
Well, I' m not doing the review.
I gave it to Gabe.
Why' d you give it to Gabe?
I gave you money to help start the label.
[Groans]
All right.
Well, what did Gabe say?
It wasn' t a bad review.
He dissed us.
He didn' t diss it.
He just wasn' t feelin 'it.
Sid, you gotta step in.
You gotta do your thing.
You' re editor.
I mean, you heard the CD.
I can' t do that, Dre.
I can' t step on his review.
You' re the main person that' s talkin 'about hip- hop losin' its way, how we gotta get back to its roots.
What' s wrong with getting in touch with why we both fell in love with hip- hop in the first place?
'Cause it' s about forward movement.
Innovate and move on.
One minute you talkin 'about you want things to change, and the next minute you talking about you want things to stay the same.
I do want things to change.
And I didn' t know this is how it would turn out.
'Cause if we look back, it will make us see things...
And if we just can stop... then maybe we can find that thing... that we both know is missing... and build on that.
Are we... are we still talking about hip- hop?
That' s all we' ve ever talked about.
It' s all we' ve ever known... from when we were 10.
Sid, just do me a favor.
Before you do something you might regret, just... just listen again.
And just follow your heart.
And whatever you decide... whatever you decide is cool.
Whatever you decide is cool.
Dre...
Dre.
I' ve made my decision.
You ain' t gonna change your mind?
What about your heart, Sid?
Sid?
Hey.
Can I get you something, sir?
Yes.
Macallan 25, neat.
Hey.
Hey.
Uh... you gonna have to treat me,
'cause I can' t afford that shit no more.
You couldn' t afford it then, remember?
Damn.
I lost nearly $200 that night.
Yeah, yeah.
[Sighs]
So, what... why' d you, uh... why' d you call me here tonight?
So we could have a drink, laugh on our good times, and, uh, act like none of this ever happened?
Yes and no.
And... he asked me one simple question.
Have we tried to make it work?
Are you serious?
Dre, let me finish.
We never tried.
like we were in high school or something.
But we' re not.
We' re married.
We took those vows, Dre.
Come on.
I know that you and Sidney have something very special that you share.
And I... and I' m hoping that whatever that reason is, it' s enough to make you want to keep me as your wife.
Oh, Reesey.
I do.
I love you.
But I think we both know that this can' t work.
I don' t know if we have enough of... what it takes to... to make this last.
I don' t know if we ever had enough.
[Footsteps]
Another round?
Damn.
Well... at least... stay a while and have a few drinks and... have a few laughs.
I hope you realize this means that I have to take half of everything you have.
Let me make it easy on you.
Here' s my little $58. 25 now.
Well, we missed the show.
I' m sorry.
I just got caught in the middle of this tug- of- war between Dre' s label and XXL and...
I don' t know what to do.
I feel so helpless.
Kelby, we can see the show on Saturday.
Yep.
Will you wait up a second?
How long are you two gonna play this game?
What are you talking about?
What am I talking about?
You don' t want to get married.
I love you.
But not the way you love him.
I' m sorry.
I don' t know why your heart doesn' t do what your mind tells it.
You don' t know.
I' m sorry.
# Lying here #
# How bad I feel #
# The clock tick #
# And I think of you... #
I always thought, one day I would outgrow my relationship with hip- hop.
# Confusion #
# Is nothing new #
I never thought it was a fad, like many.
# Flash back #
# All night #
But I never thought it could grow and mature.
# Almost left behind #
# Suitcase #
# Of memories #
# Time after sometimes #
# You picture me #
# I' m walking #
# Too far ahead #
# You' re calling to me... #
I' d look back on,
But I realize we have more than that.
Much more.
We have a history... a friendship.
We listen to each other.
We laugh together.
We finish each other' s lyrics.
I don' t have to pretend with hip- hop, and hip- hop doesn' t have to pretend with me.
# You will find me #
# Time after time #
My feelings have never been more clear, and I know they will never go away.
# I' il be waiting #
To hip- hop.
# Time after time #
# Mmm mmm... #
# Mmm mmm... #
Wait.
Didn' t I already see you?
Mm, yeah.
So what are you doing back here?
I know that y' all put a new song in rotation every week.
I' m gonna show up every week till you take a serious listen to this CD.
Then I' m gonna come back every week until you put this here CD into rotation.
Every week.
She say no.
You playin '.
No, man.
You' re not playin '?
I' m not playin ', man.
You for real?
For real, man.
Come here, boy!
Yeah!
- Whoo!
We did it, man.
You are the man!
# I worship at the temple of hip- hop #
# Attended service, Eric gave a sermon #
# But the minister became intensely nervous #
# When the killa priest went buck wild #
# And made the reverend run #
# I reached in... #
She said the Angie show, right?
They still come on at the same time, right?
Yes, man.
Still thinking about Sidney, huh?
Yeah, man.
I told you you was a punk.
I know you be trippin '.
Get your black ass...
'cause the new crack is killing you.
Don' t...
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
'cause I' il put a nigga to sleep.
Angie, On Radio:
Sid Shaw, editor of XXL magazine.

I just finished my book.
Good.

It' s called I Used To Love Him.

Ok.

When I heard Kangol Crew and Get Fresh Crew.
Well, I don' t think you understood the question, so I' m gonna ask you again.
[Knock On Glass]
Talk to him.
Dre...
I' ve been in love with you from the first day I saw you.
Thank you.
I got a follow- up question.
Uh, why' d it take you so long to say that?
'Cause I was scared.
And stupid.
Real hardheaded.

So I' m like "yo."

But, um, you know, she didn' t like the regular common glasses, so she had them make, uh, glasses that looked like her, uh... uh... eh, you know, like her upper body.

'I think about the arrivals gate at Heathrow airport.
'but I don' t see that.
'Seems to me that love is everywhere.
'Often it' s not particularly dignified or newsworthy but it' s always there.
'boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends.
'they were all messages of love.
'lf you look for it, I' ve got a sneaky feeling you' il find that love actually is all around.'
I feel it in my fingers
I feel it in my toes
Love is all around me And so the...
- (Feedback) - I' m afraid you did it again, Bill.
(Sighs) It' s just I know the old version so well, you know.
Well, we all do.
That' s why we' re making the new version.
Right, OK, let' s go.
I feel it in my fingers In my fingers
I feel it in my toes
Love is all ar...
Oh, fuck, wank, bugger, shitting arsehead and hole.
Start again.
I feel it in my fingers In my fingers
I feel it in my toes
Christmas is all around me All around me
And so the feeling grows
It' s written in the wind In the wind
It' s everywhere I go
So if you really love Christmas Love Christmas
Come on and let it snow
This is shit, isn' t it?
Yep, solid gold shit, maestro.
- God, I' m so late.
- It' s just round the corner, you' il make it.
You sure you don' t mind me going without you?
No, really.
I' m just feeling so rotten.
- I love you.
- I know.
I love you even when you' re sick and look disgusting.
Now, go or you will actually miss it.
Right.
- Did I mention that I love you?
- Yes, you did.
Get out, loser.
Karen, it' s me again.
I' m sorry, I literally don' t have anybody else to talk to.
Absolutely.
Horrible moment, though.
Can I call you back?
Of course.
Doesn' t mean I' m not terribly concerned that your wife just died.
Understood.
Er, bugger off, call me later.
So what' s this big news?
We' ve been given our parts in the nativity play and I' m the lobster.
- The lobster?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
First Lobster.
Duh.
Best sandwiches in Britain.
Try my lovely nuts?
Beautiful muffin for a beautiful lady.
Morning, my future wife.
Thanks.
(2nd man) I need a couple of orange gels.
By the way, he introduced me as John but everyone calls me Jack.
Oh, fine.
Nice to meet you, Jack.
I' m just Judy.
Great, Just Judy!.
- No surprises?
- No surprises.
- Unlike the stag night.
- You admit the prostitutes were a mistake?
- I do.
And it would' ve been much better if they' d not turned out to be men?
That is true.
Good luck, kiddo.
Thank you.
- Welcome, Prime Minister.
I must work on my wave.
How are you?
- Erm...
Cool.
Powerful.
Would you like to meet your household staff?
Yes, I would like that very much indeed.
Anything to put off actually running the country.
- This is Terence.
He' s in charge.
- Morning, sir.
I had an uncle called Terence.
Hated him, I think he was a pervert.
But I very much like the look of you.
- This is Pat.
- Hello, Pat.
Good morning, sir.
I' m the housekeeper.
I should be easier than the last lot.
No nappies, no teenagers, no scary wife.
And this is Natalie.
She' s new, like you.
- Hello, Natalie.
- Hello, David.
I mean, sir.
Shit, I can' t believe I' ve just said that.
And now I' ve gone and said "shit".
Twice.
I' m so sorry, sir.
Thank you, sir.
I had a premonition I was gonna fuck up on my first day.
Oh, piss it!
Right, I' il get my things and then let' s fix the country, shall we?
Yeah, I can' t see why not.
- It' s all right.
- Yes, I did.
- Hello there.
- I' m right over here.
Good.
Oh, no.
That is so inconvenient.
In the presence of God, Peter and Juliet have given their consent and made their marriage vows to each other.
They' ve declared their marriage by the giving of rings.
I therefore proclaim that they are husband and wife.
And you resisted the temptation for surprises.
Yeah, I' m mature now.
- Did you do this?
Er, no.
Hello!
What the hell are you doing here?
Oh, I just popped over to borrow some old CDs.
- The lady of the house let you in, did she?
- Yeah.
- Lovely, obliging girl.
- Oh.
- Listen, erm, I' ve been thinking.
What do you think?
- I just feel we' ve been bad sons this year.
- Sounds fine.
A bit boring but fine.
(Girlfriend) Hurry up, big boy!
I' m naked and I want you at least twice before Jamie gets home.
(Juliet) I am so happy to see you!
- Delicious delicacy?
- Er, no, thanks.
Taste explosion?
- Food?
- No, thanks.
Yeah, a bit dodgy, isn' t it?
Looks like a dead baby' s finger.
Tastes like it, too.
I' m Colin, by the way.
- I' m Nancy.
- Wicked.
- What do you do, Nancy?
- I' m a cook.
- Yes, I do.
- They should' ve asked you to do this one.
- They did.
- God, I wish you hadn' t have turned it down.
- I didn' t.
(Embarrassed giggle) Right.
- Why is that?
English girls.
They' re stuck up, you see.
And I am primarily attractive to girls who are cooler, game for a laugh.
Like American girls.
So I should just go to America!
I' d get a girlfriend there instantly.
What do you think?
I think it' s crap, Colin.
That' s where you' re wrong.
American girls would dig me with my cute British accent.
- You don' t have a cute British accent.
- Yes, I do!
I' m going to America.
Colin, you' re a lonely, ugly arsehole.
Accept it.
Never.
I am Colin, God of Sex.
I' m just on the wrong continent, that' s all.
Bit of quiet while we finish the lighting, guys!
- The traffic today was just...
- Unbelievable.
Judy, could you take the top off this time?
Lighting need to know when we' re gonna see the, erm, nipples and when we' re not.
Right.
At least it' s nice and warm in here.
Not always the case, is it?
- Yes, yeah.
- Bloody freezing...
Guys, time' s tight and we have to get the actors in.
- Fine.
- I promise I won' t look.
(Judy laughs) (Director) Right, let' s have another look at that, please.
- OK, yeah.
Is that all right?
- Yes.
I' il warm them up!
- Right.
It' s junction 13 that' s just murder, isn' t it?
Total gridlock this morning.
Jo and I had a lot of time to prepare for this moment.
But others she was pretty damn clear about.
I said, "Over my dead body."
And she said, "No, Daniel, over mine."
And as usual, my darling girl... and Sam' s darling mum was right.
So she' s going to say her final farewell to you not through me but, inevitably, ever so coolly, through the immortal genius of the Bay City Rollers.
Do you love him?
Er, er, what?
No.
No is the answer.
Absolutely not... on my finger...
Erm...
This DJ, what do you reckon?
- The worst in history?
- Probably.
I think it all hangs on the next song.
Now here' s one for the lovers.
That' s quite a few of you, I shouldn' t be surprised and a half.
- He' s done it, it' s official.
- Worst DJ in the world.
Sarah' s waiting for you.
Oh, yes, of course, erm...
Great, er, good, good.
How are you doing, Mia?
Learning who to avoid?
Absolutely.
- Harry?
- Sarah, switch off your phone and tell me exactly how long it is that you' ve been working here.
Two years, seven months, three days and, I suppose, what, two hours?
And how long have you been in love with Karl, our enigmatic chief designer?
Two years, seven months, three days and, I suppose, an hour and 30 minutes.
Thought as much.
- Yes.
- Do you think Karl knows?
- Yes.
Oh, that is... that is bad news.
I just thought that maybe the time had come to do something about it.
- Like what?
- lnvite him out for a drink then casually mention you' d like to marry him and have lots of sex and babies.
- You know that?
- Yes.
And so does Karl.
Think about it, for all our sakes.
It' s Christmas.
Certainly.
Excellent.
Thanks, boss.
- Hi, Sarah.
- Hi, Karl.
Babe.
Absolutely, fire away.
Mia, Mia, would you turn that down?
What is that?
That was the Christmas effort from the once great Billy Mack.
Oh, dear me, how are the mighty fallen.
I can safely say that is the worst record I' ve heard this century...
Oh, and coincidentally, I believe Billy will be a guest on my friend Mike' s show in a few minutes' time.
Welcome back, Bill.
Billy, welcome back to the airwaves.
New Christmas single, cover of Love Is All Around.
Except we' ve changed the word "love" to "Christmas".
Yes, is that an important message to you, Bill?
(Snorts) Not really, Mike.
Christmas is a time for people with someone they love in their lives.
- That' s not me, Michael.
When I was young and successful, I was greedy and foolish and now I' m left with no one, wrinkled and alone.
Thanks for that, Bill.
- For what?
For actually giving a real answer to a question.
It doesn' t often happen here at Radio Watford, I can tell you.
- Ask me anything, I' il tell you the truth.
- Best shag you ever had?
- Britney Spears.
(Snorts)
- She was rubbish.
- OK, here' s one.
How do you think the new record compares to your old, classic stuff?
Come on, Mikey, you know as well as I do the record' s crap.
But wouldn' t it be great if number one this Christmas wasn' t some smug teenager but an old ex- heroin addict searching for a comeback at any price?
Those young popsters come Christmas will be stretched out naked with a cute bird balancing on their balls and I' il be stuck in some dingy flat with me manager Joe, ugliest man in the world, fucking miserable because our fucking gamble didn' t pay off.
So if you believe in Father Christmas, children, like your Uncle Billy does, buy my festering turd of a record.
And particularly enjoy the incredible crassness of the moment we try to squeeze an extra syilable into the fourth line.
I think you' re referring to
"lf you really love Christmas..."
"Come on and let it snow." Ouch.
So, here it is one more time, the dark horse for this year' s Christmas number one,
Christmas Is All Around.
Thank you, Billy.
After this, the news.
Is the new prime minister in trouble already?
What' s next?
- The President' s visit.
Ah, yes, yes.
I fear this is going to be a difficult one to play.
Alex.
- (All) Here, here.
This is our first really important test, let' s take a stand.
Right.
Let' s not forget that America is the most powerful country in the world.
I' m not going to act like a petulant child.
Who do you have to screw round here to get a cup of tea and a biscuit?
Right.
Yeah, come in.
- Uh- huh... and these are for you.
Excellent.
Thanks a lot.
I was hoping you' d win, not that I wouldn' t have been nice to the other bloke, just always given him the boring biscuits with no chocolate.
Thanks very much.
Thanks...
Natalie.
God, come on, get a grip.
You' re the Prime Minister, for God' s sake.
So what do you reckon to our new prime minister?
Oh, I like him.
I can' t understand why he' s not married, though.
You know the type, he' s married to his job.
Either that or gay as a picnic basket.
Excuse me, Judy, if you could just lower the nipples
- and cheat them a bit to the left?
I have to say, Judy, this is a real pleasure, it' s lovely to find someone I can actually chat to.
- Oh, well, you know.
- And ditto.
- Thank you.
The move again, please, Judy.
- Ooh, sorry.
- Oh, God, sorry.
You all right?
- Exciting news!
- What?
I' ve bought a ticket to the States.
- No.
- Yes!
- To a fantastic place called Wisconsin.
Wisconsin babes, here comes Sir Colin!
There are a few babes in America, I grant you, but they' re going out with rich, attractive guys.
Tone, you' re just jealous.
You know perfectly well that any bar anywhere in America contains ten girls more beautiful and more likely to have sex with me
- than the whole of the United Kingdom.
- That is total bollocks.
You' re mad.
No, I' m wise.
Stateside I am Prince William without the weird family.
- No, Colin, no!
- Yes!
Right, the Christmas party, not my favourite night of the year and your unhappy job to organise.
- Tell me.
- It' s basic, really.
Find a venue, over- order on the drinks, bulk buy the guacamole and advise the girls to avoid Kevin if they want their breasts unfondled.
- Yeah.
I mean, not children.
But their wives and girlfriends, et cetera.
No.
I' il just be hanging around the mistletoe, hoping to be kissed.
Really?
Right.
He now spends all the time in his room.
I mean, he' il be up there now.
- That' s not unusual.
My horrid son...
Bernard.
Stays in his room all the time.
Thank goodness.
Yeah, but Karen, this is all the time.
I' m afraid that there' s something really wrong, you know?
I mean, clearly it' s about his mum but Christ, he might be injecting heroin into his eyeballs for all I know.
(Karen) At the age of 1 1?
(Daniel) Well, maybe not his eyeballs, then.
Maybe just his veins.
The problem is his mum always used to talk to him, you know, and...
Iike it never did before.
Listen, it was always going to be a totally shit time.
Just be patient.
And maybe check the room for needles.
And then when he sometimes does come out, it' s obvious he' s been crying.
It' s just such a ridiculous waste.
And now if it' s going to ruin Sam' s life as well...
I just don' t know.
Get a grip.
People hate sissies.
No one' s ever gonna shag you if you cry all the time.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Helpful.
So, what' s the problem, Samuel?
Is it just Mum or is it something else, huh?
Maybe school?
Are you being bullied?
Or is it something worse?
Can you give me any clues at all?
- You really want to know?
- I really want to know.
Even though you won' t be able to help?
Even if that' s the case, yeah.
Well... truth is, actually...
I' m in love.
Sorry?
I know I should be thinking about Mum and I am but I' m in love.
I was before she died and there' s nothing I can do about it.
- Aren' t you a bit young to be in love?
- No.
OK, well...
I' m a little relieved.
- Why?
- Because I... thought it' d be something worse.
Worse than the total agony of being in love?
No, you' re right.
Total agony.
- Night, Sarah.
- Night, Karl.
Yeah, absolutely.
Free as a bird.
Fire away.
Alone again.
Naturally.
- Mm.
- Sir.
Thanks.
Erm, I' m starting to feel... uncomfortable about us working so closely every day and me knowing so little about you, it seems elitist and wrong.
Well, erm, where do you live, for instance?
Wandsworth.
The dodgy end.
- Oh.
So which exactly is the dodgy end?
At the end of the high street, Harris Street, near the Queen' s Head.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, that is dodgy.
Erm, and you live with your husband?
Boyfriend?
- No.
I' ve just split up with my boyfriend, so I' m back with my mum and dad for a while.
Sorry.
- No, it' s fine.
I' m well shot of him.
- He said I was getting fat.
- I beg your pardon?
He said no one' d fancy a girl with thighs the size of tree trunks.
Not a nice guy, actually, in the end.
You know, erm... being Prime Minister, I could just have him murdered.
Thank you, sir.
I' il think about it.
Do.
The SAS are absolutely charming.
Ruthless, trained killers are just a phone call away.
Oh, God.
Did you have this kind of problem?
Yeah, course you did, you saucy minx.
So, let' s go.
We can definitely crack this.
Remember, I was a kid once, too.
So, come on, it' s someone at school.
- Uh- huh.
Good, good.
And what does she, he, feel about you?
SHE doesn' t even know my name.
And even if she did, she' d despise me.
She' s the coolest girl in school.
And everyone worships her because she' s heaven.
Good.
Well, basically you' re fucked, aren' t you?
Hi there and welcome back.
So, three weeks till Christmas, looks like the real competition is gonna be Blue.
I saw them on the show last week.
They weren' t very nice about my record.
No.
Little scamps.
But very, very talented musicians.
I understand you' ve got a prize for our competition winners.
Yes, I have, Ant or Dec.
It' s a personalised felt- tip pen.
Oh, great.
It' s brilliant.
It even writes on glass, so if you' ve got a framed picture, like, for instance, this one of Blue, you can just write on it.
(Kids snickering) (Dec) Er, a lot of kids watching, Billy.
(Billy) Oh, yeah.
Hiya, kids.
Here' s an important message from your Uncle Bill - don' t buy drugs.
Become a pop star and they give you them for free.
And I do believe it' s a commercial break.
We' il see you soon.
Bye- bye.
All I want for Christmas is you
Eurh!
- Just a minute.
Actually, they' re not funny.
They' re art.
OK, let' s say, er, Thursday, my place.
Great.
I' ve got Juliet on the other line, she wants to ask you a favour.
- (Sighing) OK, fine.
- Thanks and, er, be nice.
- I' m always nice.
- 'You know what I mean, Marky, be friendly.'
- I' m always...
- (Juliet) 'Mark?'
Hi.
How was the honeymoon?
It was great.
Thanks for the gorgeous sendoff.
- So, what can I do for you?
- 'It' s only a tiny favour.'
I' ve just tried the wedding video and it' s a disaster.
- 'It' s come out all blue and wibbly.'
- I' m sorry.
I remember you filming a lot and I wondered if I could look at it.
To be honest, I didn' t really...
Please.
All I want is one shot of me in a wedding dress that isn' t turquoise.
I' il have a look but I' m pretty sure I wiped it, so don' t get any hopes up.
- (Click)
No.
I' ve done fuck- all and never will because he' s too good for me.
How true.
- (Mobile)
And of course, your mobile goes.
Hi.
How you doing?
- So, how' s the Christmas party going?
- Good.
Think I' ve found a venue.
- Good.
Good.
It' s an art gallery.
Full of dark corners for doing dark deeds.
Good.
Well, I suppose I should take a look at it or something.
You should.
Welcome back.
And this year you bring a lady guest?
No.
There' s a change of situation.
Just me.
Am I sad or not sad?
- I think you' re not surprised.
- And you stay here till Christmas?
- Yeah, yeah.
Good.
Well, I find you a perfect lady to clean the house.
This is Aurelia.
Unfortunately, she cannot speak French, just like you.
She' s Portuguese.
I think she' s ten years too young to remember a footballer called Eusebio.
And "molto bueno" is Spanish.
Right.
Anyway, it' s nice to meet you and...
Can you drive her home after her work?
Oh, absolutely, yes.
Which is what?
Turkish?
No, right.
Silence is golden.
As the Tremeloes said.
Clever guys, although I think the original version was by Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons.
Gr- great band.
Oh, shut up.
(Press) Mr President!
Mr President, welcome.
It' s a pleasure to meet you.
Come through.
I' m sorry your wife couldn' t make it.
So is she.
Although she would have been kind of lonely.
Yes.
Pathetic, isn' t it?
Just never been able to tie a girl down.
Not sure that politics and dating go together.
Really?
I' ve never found that.
Yeah, you' re still sickeningly handsome, whereas I look like my Aunt Mildred.
- Thank you.
We love that thing.
Morning, ma' am.
How' s your day so far?
- (Natalie giggles) - Excellent.
(Sighs) My goodness, that' s a pretty little son of a bitch.
Did you see those pipes?
Yeah, she' s terrific.
At her job.
No, absolutely not.
We cannot and will not consult on that either.
That is unexpected.
Well, it shouldn' t be.
The last administration made it perfectly clear.
We' re being consistent with their policies.
With all respect, they were bad policies.
Thanks, Alex.
I don' t think we' re making progress here.
Let' s, erm... move on, shall we?
Well, now, that was an interesting day.
Sorry if our line was firm but there' s no point in tiptoeing around today, then just disappointing you for four years.
I have plans and I plan to see them through.
Absolutely.
There is one final thing to look at.
It' s very close to my heart.
Just give me a second.
I' il give you anything you ask for.
As long as it' s not something I don' t wanna give.
Hi.
Pathetic.
It' s great Scotch.
I' il, erm...
I' il be going, then.
I hope to see much more of you as our countries work toward a better future.
Thank you, sir.
Er, yes, Peter.
Mr President, has it been a good visit?
Very satisfactory indeed.
We got what we came for and our special relationship is still very special.
Prime Minister?
I love that word "relationship".
Covers all manner of sins, doesn' t it?
I fear that this has become a bad relationship.
A relationship based on the President taking what he wants and casually ignoring all those things that really matter to, erm...
Britain.
We may be a small country but we' re a great one, too.
The country of Shakespeare, Churchill, the Beatles,
- Sean Connery, Harry Potter.
- (Laughter)
David Beckham' s left foot, come to that.
And a friend who bullies us is no longer a friend.
I will be prepared to be much stronger.
And the President should be prepared for that.
It' s your sister on line four.
Er, yes, I' m very busy and important, how can I help you?
Have you gone completely insane?
- You can' t always be sensible.
- 'You can if you' re Prime Minister.'
- It isn' t!
- 'I' il call you back.'
- No, you won' t!
The trouble with being the Prime Minister' s sister is it puts your life into perspective.
What did my brother do today?
He fought for his country.
What did I do?
I made a papier- maché lobster head.
What is this we' re listening to?
Joni Mitchell.
I can' t believe you still listen to Joni Mitchell.
I love her and true love lasts a lifetime.
Joni Mitchell is the woman who taught your cold English wife how to feel.
Did she?
Oh, well, that' s good, I must write to her and say thanks.
Which doll for Daisy' s friend Emily?
The one that looks like a transvestite or the one that looks like a dominatrix?
'so here' s one for our arse- kicking prime minister.
'A golden oldie for a golden oldie.'
Mary, can we move the Japanese ambassador to four o' clock tomorrow?
- Certainly, sir.
- Terrific.
Thanks so much.
Would you like the last, er...?
(Portuguese) Thank you very much but no.
If you saw my sister, you' d understand why.
That' s all right, more for me.
(Portuguese) Just don' t go eating it all yourself, you' re getting chubbier every day.
I' m very lucky I' ve got a constitution where I never put on weight.
- (Ringing continues)
Sorry.
Hello?
- Thank you.
- God, it' s half the book.
- Que desastre.
Just leave them, please!
They' re not important.
They' re not worth it!
Stop!
It' s all just rubbish.
Just leave it.
Oh, God, she' s in.
And now she' il think I' m a total spaz if I don' t go in too.
(Portuguese) Fuck - it' s cold!
Fuck!
(Portuguese) This stuff better be good.
It' s not worth it, this isn' t bloody Shakespeare.
(Portuguese) I don' t want to drown saving some shit my grandmother could have written.
Stop.
(Portuguese) What kind of idiot doesn' t make copies?
I really must do copies.
There' d better not be eels in here.
(Portuguese) Try not to disturb the eels.
Oh, what the hell is that?
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I' il name one of the characters after you.
(Portuguese) Maybe you could name one of the characters after me.
Or give me 50% of the profits.
Or I could give you 5% of the profits.
(Portuguese) What kind of book is it?
- Yes.
It' s, erm... (lmitates horror film sound effects)
Ah, er... (Portuguese) Thriller... crime... (Portuguese) Sim.
(English) Crime.
Er, scary?
Yes, sometimes scary.
And, er, sometimes not.
Mainly scary how bad the writing is.
(Portuguese) I' d better get back to work.
- (Portuguese) Later you' il drive me home?
Sure.
It' s my favourite time of day... driving you.
(Portuguese) It' s the saddest part of my day, leaving you.
Sorry.
(TV 'And coming up later this morning, it' s this guy...'
There' s no beginning, there' il be no end
- Cos on Christmas...
- '. he bad grandad of rock' n' roll,
Do not switch off. '
Banoffee pie?
Thank God.
You would' ve broken my heart if you' d said yes.
Right, well, lucky you.
- Can I come in?
- Er, yeah, well, I' m a bit busy...
I was just passing and I thought we might check that video thing out.
I thought I might be able to swap it for some pie or maybe Munchies?
Actually, I was serious - I don' t know where it is.
I' il have a look tonight.
Mark, can I say something?
I know you' re Peter' s best friend and I know you' ve never particularly warmed to me.
Look, don' t, don' t argue.
We' ve never got friendly.
But I wanted to say, I hope that can change.
I really am.
Apart from my terrible taste in pie and...
It would be great if we could be friends.
Absolutely.
Great.
Doesn' t mean we' il be able to find the video, though.
I had a real search when you first called and couldn' t find it so...
This one says "Peter and Juliet' s Wedding".
Do you think we might be on the right track?
Er, yeah, well...
Wow.
That- that could be it.
- Do you mind if I...?
- I' ve probably taped over it.
Almost everything' s episodes of West Wing.
Oh, bingo.
That' s lovely.
Well done, you.
Oh, that' s gorgeous.
Thank you so much, Mark, this is exactly what I was hoping for.
I look quite pretty.
You' ve stayed rather close.
They' re all of me.
(Mark) Yeah.
Yes.
But... you never talk to me.
You always talk to Peter.
You don' t like me.
I hope it' s useful.
Don' t show it around too much.
Needs a bit of editing.
Look, I' ve got to get to a... Iunch.
Early lunch.
You can just show yourself out, can' t you?
It' s a... self- preservation thing, you see.
Annie, my darling, my dream, my boat.
- Need you to do a favour for me.
- Of course.
Anything for the hero of the hour.
Don' t ask me why, and don' t read stuff into this, it' s just a weird personality thing.
But, erm, you know Natalie who works here?
The chubby girl?
Ooh, would we call her chubby?
I think there' s a pretty sizeable arse there, yes, sir.
Huge thighs.
Well, whatever, erm...
I' m sure she' s a lovely girl but I wonder if you could, erm... redistribute her?
It' s done.
Hey, Sammo.
Can' t sleep?
I got some terrible news today.
Let' s have it.
- Joanna' s going back to America.
- Your girl' s American?
Yes, she' s American.
And she' s not my girl.
And she' s going back to America.
That' s the end of my life as I know it.
That is bad news.
Well, we need Kate and we need Leo, and we need them now.
Come on.
Hold on.
'Keep your eyes closed.
- 'Do you trust me?'
- 'I trust you.'
- Do you trust me?
- Fool!
- Get off, you big bully.
'All right, open your eyes.'
You know, Sammy, I' m sure she' s unique and extraordinary but general wisdom is that in the end, there isn' t just one person for each of us.
There was for Kate and Leo.
There was for you.
And there is for me.
She' s the one.
Fair enough.
And her name' s Joanna?
Yeah, I know.
Same as Mum.
- Prime Minister.
- Thank you very much.
Grande, er... grande familio, grande tradizione de Christmas presents.
Stupido.
Well, goodbye.
(Portuguese) Thank you.
Erm, it was, erm...
(Portuguese) I will miss you.
And your very slow typing... and your very bad driving.
You know I love Christmas, I always will
My mind' s made up, the way that I feel
There' s no beginning, there' il be no end
Cos on Christmas you can depend
Daniel!
- I have a plan.
- Thank the Lord.
Tell me.
- Uh- huh.
- That' s right.
Meat Loaf definitely got laid at least once.
For God' s sake, Ringo Starr married a Bond girl.
There' s this big concert at the end of term and Joanna' s in it.
I thought if I was in the band and played superbly, she might fall in love with me.
I think it' s brilliant, I think it' s stellar.
Apart from the one obvious tiny little baby little hiccup.
- I don' t play a musical instrument?
- Yes, sir.
A tiny, insignificant detail.
Too Lost In You) You look into my eyes
I suppose I' d better do the duty round.
You' re a saint.
Any chance of a dance with the boss?
Yeah, sure, sure.
As long as your boyfriend doesn' t mind.
Not my boyfriend.
You' re looking very pretty tonight.
It' s for you.
Sorry?
It' s all for you, sir.
'This must be very exciting for you, fighting for the Christmas number one.
- 'How' s it looking so far?'
- 'Very bad indeed.
'Blue are outselling me five to one
'but I' m hoping for a late surge.
'I promise to sing a song stark naked on TV on Christmas Eve.'
- 'Do you mean that?'
- 'Of course I do, Michael.
'Do you want a preview?
You old flirt. '
'That' il never make number one.'
I suppose it' s his job to dance with everyone, isn' t it?
Some more than others.
Just one dance?
- Before we run out of chances.
- Unless you just...
- No!
Good.
Yes.
Thanks.
I' d better go.
OK.
- Good night.
Actually...
- I don' t have to go.
Good.
- I mean...
- No, that' s good.
Just, erm, would you excuse me for one second?
- Sure.
- Just one second.
Erm...
Why don' t you come upstairs in about ten seconds?
- Ten seconds.
- OK.
You' re beautiful.
I- I' d better answer that.
Hello, darling.
No, no, I' m not busy.
No, fire away.
Right.
Yes, I...
I' m not quite sure it' s gonna be possible to get the Pope on the phone tonight but...
Yes, I' m sure he' s very good at exorcism but...
Well, I' m sure...
Jon Bon Jovi is as well and I' il definitely look into it.
OK?
OK, I' il talk to you later.
All right, bye- bye.
- Sorry about that.
- No, it' s fine.
It' s my brother, he' s not well, he calls a lot.
- No, it' s fine.
It' s fine.
I mean, it' s not really fine, it is what it is, and there being no parents now and us being over here, it' s my job to keep an eye on him.
Not my job, obviously, I' m glad to do it...
That' s OK.
Life is full of interruptions and complications.
So...
Will it make him better?
No.
Then maybe... don' t answer.
How you doing?
Right, right.
Oh, no, please.
Oh, please, please don' t, little darling.
Between the two of us we' il find the answer and it won' t hurt any more.
I...
Mm- hm.
OK.
That was a good night.
- Don' t be ridiculous.
It' s true.
Nowadays the only clothes I can get into were once owned by Pavarotti.
I always think Pavarotti dresses very well.
Mia' s very pretty.
Is she?
You know she is, darling.
Be careful there.
Have you been watching stuff on TV?
Yeah.
- Good.
And every day.
- The nurses are trying to kill me.
- Nobody' s trying to kill you, babe.
Thank you.
Don' t do that, my darling.
Thank you.
Don' t do that.
Back at three.
Christmas shopping, never easy or pleasant.
Are you gonna get me something?
I don' t know, I hadn' t thought.
Where' s Sarah, by the way?
She couldn' t make it in.
Family thing.
There' s a word for hangover I' ve never heard before.
- Yes.
Looking forward to it.
A lot.
Are you gonna give me something?
I thought I made it clear last night.
When it comes to me, you can have everything.
So, erm, what do you need?
Something along the stationery line?
Are you short of staplers?
I don' t want something I need.
I want something I want.
Something pretty.
Right.
Sorry I' m late, I had to drop off Bernie at rehearsal.
Right, listen, you keep yourself occupied while I do the boring stuff for our mothers.
Yes.
That necklace there, how much is it?
It' s 270.
Er, I' il have it.
- Lovely.
Would you like it... giftwrapped?
- Yes, all right.
- Lovely.
Let me just pop it in the box.
There.
- Look, could we be quite quick?
- Certainly, sir.
Ready in the flashiest of flashes.
- That' s great.
Not quite finished.
- I don' t need a bag, I' il put it in my pocket.
- Oh, this isn' t a bag, sir.
- Really?
- This is so much more than a bag.
Could we be quite quick, please?
- What' s that?
- A cinnamon stick, sir.
- Actually, I really can' t wait.
- You won' t regret it, sir.
Want to bet?
'Tis but the work of a moment.
There we go.
Almost finished.
Are you gonna dip it in yogurt?
Cover it with chocolate buttons?
No, sir, we' re going to pop it in the Christmas box.
I don' t want a Christmas box.
- But you wanted it giftwrapped.
- I did but...
- The final flourish.
- Can I pay?
- All we need now...
- No, no, no, no.
- But sir...
- Leave it.
- No.
I was just looking around.
Don' t worry.
My expectations are not that high after 1 3 years of Mr Oh- But- You- Always- Love- Scarves.
Actually, I do love this one.
I' ve gotta know
- What are you doing here?
Had to rent out my flat to pay for my ticket.
You' re not actually going ahead with this stupid plan?
I bloody am.
You think this is full of clothes?
Like hell it is.
It is chock- a- block full of condoms.
Excellent.
Perfect, keep that going.
(Clears throat) Look, erm... sorry to be a bit forward and all that but... you don' t fancy going for a Christmas drink, do you?
Just maybe go and see something Christmassy or something.
Obviously, if you don' t want to, you don' t have to.
I...
No.
That would be lovely.
Oh, great.
You know, that is really great.
Normally, I' m really shy, takes me ages to get the courage up, so thank you.
- Explain again why you' re so late.
- Can' t a man have any secrets?
We' ve been waiting for hours, it' s the first ever preview... is a thing of the past
Visions of sugarplums have disappeared... (Karen) It was a starry night in ancient Jerusalem and the baby Jesus was in his manger.
Sherlock Holmes is not a real detective.
(Russian) Is this the way to the train station?
I would like half- pint of churly.
I would like a one- day Travelcard.
(Portuguese) Oh, my God, I' ve got a terrible stomachache.
It must have been the prawns.
Milton Keynes has many roundabouts.
(Portuguese) My goodness, this is a very big fish!
It tastes delicious!
All alone on Christmas Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
- You' il come back a broken man.
- Yeah, back broken from too much sex.
You are on the road to disaster.
No, I am on shag highway, heading west.
Farewell, failure.
America, watch out!
Here comes Colin Frissell.
And he' s got a big knob
- Take me to a bar.
- What kind of bar?
Just any bar.
Just your average American bar.
- Yes.
I' d like a Budweiser, please.
- King of beers.
- Bud coming up.
Oh, my God.
Are you from England?
- Oh... that is so cute.
Hi, I' m Stacey.
Jeannie?
- This is...
- Colin.
Frissell.
Cute name.
- Jeannie.

Yep.
Basildon.
Wait till Carol- Anne gets here.
She' s crazy about English guys.
- Hey, girls.
- Carol- Anne, come meet Colin.
He' s from England.
Well, step aside, ladies.
This one' s on me.
- (Gentle growl)
That is so funny!
- What do you call that?
- Er, bottle.
- What about this?
- Er, straw.
- What about this?
- Table.
The same.
- Oh, it' s the same.
- Where are you staying?
- I don' t actually know.
I' il just check into a motel like in the movies.
Oh, my God, that is so cute.
This may be a bit pushy cos we just met you but... why don' t you come back and sleep at our place?
Well, if it' s not too much of an inconvenience.
- Hell no!
- But there' s one problem.
What?
Well, we' re not the richest of girls, you know.
So we just have a little bed and no couch.
So you' d have to share with all three of us.
And on this cold, cold night it' s gonna be crowded and sweaty and stuff.
And we can' t even afford pyjamas.
Which means... we would be naked.
- (Girls) Great.
- Erm...
The thing that' s gonna make it more crowded...
Harriet.
You haven' t met Harriet.
- Yeah.
Don' t worry, you' re totally gonna like her cos she is "the sexy one".
- Really?
Wow.
- Praise the Lord!
- Oh, and he' s a Christian.
(All) Cheers.
One present only each tonight.
Who' s got one for Dad?
- I have.
- Let Mummy go first.
- No, no, no.
I want to choose mine.
I think I want... -.. this one.
- I have bought the traditional scarf as well but this is my other, slightly special, personal one.
Thank you.
That' s a real first.
- Rip it!
- What is it?
All right, I' il rip it.
God, that' s a surprise.
(Daisy) What is it?
It' s a CD.
Joni Mitchell, wow.
To continue your emotional education.
Goodness.
That' s great.
- My brilliant wife.
Actually, do you mind if I just absent myself for a second?
All that ice cream.
Darling, could you make sure the kids are ready to go?
- Back in a minute.
- (Harry to kids) All right, take it easy.
(Bernie) Mine first.
Mine.
Oh, my God.
It' s a miracle.
You' re all dressed.
Come on, come on, come on, we' re horribly late.
Come on, then.
In the car.
In the car.
- Has she noticed you yet?
- No.
But the thing about romance is people only get together right at the very end.
Of course.
By the way, I feel bad.
I never ask you how your love life is going.
As you know, that was a done deal long ago.
- you wee motherless mongrel.
We' il want to have sex in every room, including yours.
(Male DJ) 'It' s a rainy Christmas Eve all over the UK
'and the question is who is number one on the Radio One chart show tonight?
'ls it Blue or the unexpected Christmas sensation from Billy Mack?
'You might have guessed it although you may not believe it.
'It' s Billy Mack.'
- (Crowd) Shh.
- 'Hi, Billy.'
- Hello.
'We' re live across the nation and you' re number one.
- 'How will you be celebrating?'
- I don' t know.
Er, either I could behave like a real rock' n' roll loser and get drunk with my fat manager... or, when I hang up,
I' il be flooded by invitations to a large number of glamorous parties.
'Let' s hope it' s the latter.
Number one, from Billy Mack,
- 'it' s Christmas Is All Around.'
- Oh, Jesus, not that crap again.
Bill, it' s for you, babe.
Elton.
O- Of course.
Of course.
Send an embarrassingly big car and I' il be there.
It' s gonna be a very good Christmas.
- Right.
- I' d better be getting inside, actually.
- My mum and... you know.
- Of course, yeah.
It' s getting a bit cold.
- Well, good night.
- Night.
OK.

Right.
Thank you.
Good.
Good night.
Oh, look, everyone, it' s Uncle Jamie.
Hi, Uncle Jamie!
Yes, oh, splendid.
It' s lovely to see you all.
I' m off, actually.
But Jamie, darling.
Sorry.
Man' s gotta do what a man' s gotta do.
I hate Uncle Jamie!
(Girl) I hate Uncle Jamie.
(Boy) I hate Uncle Jamie.
Gatwick airport, please.
Fast as you can.
- Night, Sarah.
- Night, Karl.
I, er...
- Merry Christmas.

Hi, babe, how' s it going?
Is it all party, party, party down there?
And may all of your Christmases
Baby may your days
- Sam, time for dinner.
Sam, I' ve done chicken kebabs.
(Sam) Look at the sign on the door.
Right.
It' s a little long.
I' il get it.
- (Peter) Who is it?
It' s carol singers.
(Turns volume up)
Holy night
All is calm
Round yon virgin
Mother and child
Holy infant
So tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night
Shepherds quake
At the sight... (Whispers) Merry Christmas.
Enough.
Enough now.
What the hell are you doing here?
You' re supposed to be at Elton John' s.
Well, I was there for a minute or two and then I had an epiphany.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Come on.
Just come up.
So what was this epiphany?
Erm, it... it was about Christmas.
You realised it was all around.
No.
I realised that Christmas is the time to be with the people you love.
Right.
And I realised that, as dire chance and fateful cockup would have it, here I am, mid- fifties, and without knowing it, I' ve spent most of my adult life with a chubby employee.
And, much as it grieves me to say it, it might be that the people I love is, in fact... you.
Well, this is a surprise.
Yeah.
Ten minutes at Elton John' s and you' re gay?
No, look.
I' m serious here.
I left Elton' s and a hefty number of half- naked chicks with their mouths open in order to hang out with you at Christmas.
- It' s a terrible, terrible mistake, chubs...
but you turn out to be the fucking love of my life.
And to be honest, despite all my complaining... we have had a wonderful life.
Well... thank you.
I mean, come on, it' s been an honour.
I feel very proud.
Oh, look, don' t be a moron.
Come on, let' s get pissed and watch porn.
(Natalie) 'Dear sir, Dear David,
'Merry Christmas and I hope you have a very happy New Year.
'I' m very sorry about the thing that happened.
'It was a very odd moment and I feel like a prize idiot.
'if you can' t say it at Christmas, when can you, eh? -
With love, your Natalie. '
Jack, yeah, I need a car.
Right now.
Thank you.
Oh, don' t wait up.
I' d like to go to Wandsworth, the dodgy end.
Very good, sir.
I know you like what you see... (Terry) Harris Street.
(David) Oh, God, it' s the longest street in the world and I have absolutely no idea.
- No.
- Right, fine, thank you.
Sorry to disturb.
Aren' t you the Prime Minister?
- Er, yes.
Merry Christmas.
Part of the service now.
Trying to get round everyone by New Year' s Eve.
Does Natalie live here?
- No, she doesn' t.
OK.
- Er, no.
No, I' m not.
- Please, sir, please.
- Please.
Well, I suppose I could.
Please.
- (Girls cheer)
Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen (Joins in with rich, deep voice) When the snow lay round about
Deep and crisp and even
Brightly shone the moon that night
Sorry to disturb.
- Does Natalie live here?
She lives next door.
Brilliant.
You' re not who I think you are, are you?
Yes and I' m sorry about all the cockups.
My cabinet are absolute crap.
We hope to do better next year.
Merry Christmas to you.
Hello.
Is, er, Natalie in?
Oh, where the fuck is my fucking coat?
Hello.
- Hello.
Erm, this is my mum and my dad and my Uncle Tony and my Auntie Glynne.
- Very nice to meet you.
And, erm... this is the Prime Minister.
Yes, we can see that, darling.
And erm, unfortunately, we' re very late.
It' s the school Christmas concert, you see, David.
All the local schools have joined together, even St Basil' s...
- Too much detail, Mum.
- Anyway, how can we help, sir?
Well, I... just needed Natalie... on some state business.
- Right, yes.
Of course.
Well, perhaps you should come on later, Plumpy.
Er, Natalie.
I don' t want to make you late for the concert.
- No, it' s nothing, really.
- Keith' il be very disappointed.
- No, really, it doesn' t matter.
- The octopus costume' s taken me months.
Eight is a lot of legs, David.
Listen, why don' t I give you a lift and then we can talk about this state business business in the car.
OK.
- Lovely, yes.
- Thank you.
Hold tight, everybody.
- How far is this place?
- Just round the corner.
Ah, right.
Well, er...
I just wanted to say... thank you for the Christmas card.
You' re welcome.
Look, I' m so sorry about that day.
I came in and he slinked towards me and there was a fire and he' s the President of the United States and nothing happened, I promise.
I think about you all the time, actually.
- And I think you' re the man that I really...
- Oh, wow.
Er...
Well, look, I...
I think I' d better not come in, you know?
Nobody wants some politician stealing the kids' thunder.
No, please come.
It' il be great.
No, I' d... I' d better not.
But I will be very sorry to drive away from you.
Just give me one second.
John' s been very mysterious.
Where did you two meet?
Come on in.
We can watch from backstage.
OK.
Terry, I won' t be long.
Don' t worry.
This was my school.
I know my way around.
Look, the sheep are ready already and you' re not even...
- Oh, David.
Oh, how are you?
Hey, hey, hey.
You all right?
What the hell are you doing here?
- Well, you know...
- We always tell your secretary that these things are going on but it never occurred to me you' d actually turn up.
I thought it was time I did.
I didn' t want anyone to see, so I' m gonna hide somewhere.
Good luck, Daisy, good luck, Bernie.
I' ve never been gladder to see my stupid big brother.
- Thank you.
- All right.
We haven' t been introduced.
Right.
Well, this is Gavin.
- Hello, Gavin.
- My copper.
- Oh.
Watch he keeps his hands off you.
20 years ago, you' d have been his type.
I' il be very careful.
Don' t try something, sir, just because it' s Christmas.
Come on.
Showtime.
Quickly.
- Look, see you after, yeah?
- Probably.
- Thank you, Prime Minister.
- It' s all right.
- Right.
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket
Save it for a rainy day

Absolutely no idea.
I mean, can you imagine?
I' il see you later, all right?
I' il speak to you.
Bye.
Tell me, if you were in my position, what would you do?
What position is that?
- Oh, Karen...
- Would you wait around to find out...
- Good night.
- Night, darling.
Happy Christmas.
Would you wait around to find out if it' s just a necklace or if it' s sex and a necklace or if, worst of all, it' s a necklace and love?
Would you stay?
Knowing life would always be a little bit worse?
- Or would you cut and run?
- Oh, God.
I am so in the wrong.
A classic fool.
Yes, but you' ve also made a fool out of me.
You' ve made the life I lead foolish, too.
Darling.
Ooh, darlings!
Oh, you were wonderful.
My little lobster, you were so...
What is that word?
Orange.
Come on, I' ve got treats at home.
Dad' s coming.
Fantastic show!
Classic drumming, son.
- Thanks.
Plan didn' t work, though.
- Tell her, then.
- Tell her what?
No way.
Anyway, they fly tonight.
Even better.
Sam, you' ve got nothing to lose and you' il always regret it if you don' t.
I never told your mum enough.
I should have told her every day because she was perfect every day.
You' ve seen the films, kiddo.
It ain' t over till it' s over.
Let' s do it.
Let' s go get the shit kicked out of us by love.
Yes.
- Just give me one sec.
- Yeah.
- Sorry.
That' s OK.
- My fault.
- No, no, really, it wasn' t.
You' re Sam' s dad, aren' t you?
Yeah.
Stepdad, actually.
- I' m Carol.
Carol.
- OK, I' m back.
Let' s go.
Well...
I hope we' il meet again, Karen.
(Laughs)
- Yeah?
Good.
- What?
- You know...
- Don' t be such an arse.
- Where?
Over there.
Oh, no.
It' s OK, we' il go to the airport.
I know a short cut.
(Portuguese) Good evening.
I am here to ask your daughter for her hands in marriage.
You want to marry my daughter?
Yes.
Come here, there is a man at the door.
He wants to marry you.
Who cares?
You' re going to sell me to a complete stranger?
Sell?
Who said sell?
I' il pay him.
Pardon me.
I' m meaning your other daughter - Aurelia.
She' s not here - she' s at work.
I' il take you.
Stay here.
As if I would.
Stupid!
Father is about to sell Aurelia as a slave to this Englishman.
Wait.
Wait.
Oh, no.
You better not say yes, Father.
Shut up, Miss Dunkin 'Donut 2003.
- Look, we' re not actually flying.
- You can' t come through.
Not even to let the boy say goodbye to the love of his life?
No.
- I' m sorry, Sam.
- Boarding pass, sir?
Just a moment, I know I' ve got it.
Would you hang on to that?
- What?
- Do you want to make a run for it?
- Hold on to that.
- You think I should?
- Yeah.
- OK.
- Yes!
I must have left them where I was having a cup of coffee.
Apparently he is going to kill Aurelia.
Cool!
Joanna.
Sam?
- I thought you didn' t know my name.
- Course I do.
Oh, Jesus.
Here, I' ve gotta run.
- (Portuguese) Where is Aurelia?
- Why should I tell you?
This man wants to marry her.
He can' t do that - she' s our best waitress.
Beautiful Aurelia...
I' ve come here with a view to asking you... to marriage me.
I know I seems an insane person because I hardly knows you but sometimes things are so transparency, they don' t need evidential proof.
And I will inhabit here, or you can inhabit with me in England.
Definitely go for England, girl.
You' il meet Prince William - then you can marry him instead.
Of course I don' t expecting you to be as foolish as me, and of course I prediction you say no.... but it' s Christmas and I just wanted to... check.
Oh, God - say yes, you skinny moron.
(English) Thank you.
That will be nice.
Yes is being my answer.
Easy question.
(Portuguese) What did you say?
Yes, of course.
Bravo!
(English) You learned English?
Just in cases.
I may not always love you
Hello, Daisy.
- Hello, Greta.
I' il make you so sure about it...
This is Aurelia.
This is Juliet.
This is Peter.
- Mark, didn' t see you there.
- Just thought I' d tag along.
Jamie' s friends are so good- looking.
He never tells me this.
I think maybe now I have made the wrong choice, picked wrong Englishman.
She can' t speak English properly.
(Daisy) Dad!
Dad!
Oh, God.
- Did you get us any presents?
- Matter of fact, I did.
(Bernie) Thanks, Dad.
- I' m fine.
I' m fine.
Good to have you back.
Home.
There she is.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Aw, he should have kissed her.
- No, that' s cool.
- Hey.
What are you two doing here?
- I might get a shag at last.
- Naughty.
- Got to go.
Now, this is Harriet.
Really pleased to meet you.
- Hello, Harriet.
I hope you don' t mind, I sort of brought my sister to stay.
This is Carla.
She' s real friendly.
Hello, you must be Tony.
I heard you were gorgeous.
- God, you weigh a lot.
- Oh, shut your face.
God only knows what I' d be without you
Hey, can I get another drink down here?
I' ve been to prison once.
I' ve been married twice.
I was once drafted by Lyndon Johnson and had to live in shit- ass Mexico for two and a half years for no reason.
I' ve had my eye socket punched in, a kidney taken out, and I got a bone chip in my ankle that' s never gonna heal.
I' ve seen some pretty shitty situations in my life.
But nothing has ever sucked more ass than this.
If I' d known I was gonna have to put up with screaming brats pissing on my lap for 30 days out of the year,
I would have killed myself a long time ago.
Come to think of it, I still might.
Where I come from, we didn' t celebrate Christmas.
Not because we were Jewish, but because my dad was a worthless- coward fucking asshole whose idea of a present was a daily punch to the back of the head.
He did teach me how to crack a safe, though.
My dad never did shit with his life, so he took it out on me.
You could say I' m no different.
I' d have to say you were right.
But at this point, it' s too late to start over.
Funny how things work out.
It' s fucking hilarious.
Look there.
What a darling photo.
Are you certain you only want the single?
Additional photos come in handy as gifts for Grandma and Grandpa or as a wonderful remembrance for friends.
You know what?
This one, I think it' s more than enough.
Thanks.
Merry Christmas.
So, what do you want, little girl?
A drum set.
Oh, the old man will love that.
Fine.
See you later.
I saw you at another mall.
Well, I' m very happy for you.
You' re not really Santa.
If you were Santa, you could do magic.
You want to see some magic?
Here.
Let' s watch you disappear.
Santa' s got to pee.
- What do you want?
- A new bike.
That' s a new one.
Excellent.
Attention, shoppers.
The store will be closing in five minutes.
We hope tomorrow is a pleasant Christmas.
Thank you for shopping with us.
- Is that it?
- Yeah, that' s the last one.
Thank the fuck Christ.
Jesus, Mother Mary, and Joseph.
You pissed yourself.
Aw, Jesus.
Yeah, all right.
Yeah.
Hey, happy holidays.
All right.
Merry Christmas.
Happy holidays.
Get home safe.
Yeah, okay.
I don' t care what he says.
- We' re going out for a beer.
- What the fuck?
I' il get right back to you.
What the hell' s wrong with you?
I' m trying to fucking leave.
Pants are awful baggy.
You got anything in there?
Yeah.
My dick.
You want to see it?
Keep pushing me.
I got my eyes on you.
All the time.
Ready.
Jesus.
- How' s it going?
- I' m finished when I' m finished.
I' m going back upstairs.
I need a melon baller and a loofah.
Got it.
Fuck the loofah.
Let' s go.
Marcus, you get the loofah?
Drive.
Oh!
Put me down.
Hey, put me down.
Come on!
Put me down.
Oh, come on.
Oh, man.
Hey, baby, two more of these, all right?
That' s it for me.
You can' t drink worth a shit, you know that?
I weigh 92 pounds, you dick.
One more.
It' s a celebration.
Here' s to you.
You' re getting worse, you know that?
Well, at least I got it open.
It took you long enough.
I remember when you could unlock a lock like it was nothing.
Yeah, well, you don' t have to worry about me anymore.
I' m out.
Bullshit.
Bullshit, my ass.
We just made $111, 000 in one night.
Exactly.
I figure I got enough to go to Miami.
And do what?
I don' t know.
Get a car.
Get a place, maybe.
Maybe start a business.
A bar out on the beach.
Something like that.
I could quit drinking and run the place.
Maybe marry a waitress.
What?
You ain' t gonna do shit except go down there and drink your fucking ass off.
You' re gonna piss everything away and end up counting the days till next Christmas.
You' d like that, wouldn' t you?
Well, it ain' t gonna happen.
If I call you next December... if I call you next December... you' re gonna be so happy to hear from me you' re gonna do a goddamn backflip.
You' re gonna put that Santa hat on so fast that you' re gonna get fucking hat- burn.
Can I get you guys two more?
We' re all right.
See?
I' m already on the wagon.
Asshole!
How many times I got to tell you?
Get out from behind my bar!
Put the drink down right now.
Put the drink down right now!
Fuck you.
- Fuck me, huh?
- Right.
Hey!
Get the fuck out of my bar.
Fuck you!
You' re fucking crazy.
Fucking prick.
Asshole!
Get the fuck out of here right now!
Fucking shit!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Yeah, baby.
Hey, Tiffany, you want to play "Hide the Nazi" one day?
God damn it.
Here you go, sweetie.
I got something for your pretty ass.
- Yeah.
Wow. $5.
Thanks.
I gotta listen to my messages, and you need to take a shower.
I' m a dancer.
I sweat.
Yeah, well, you smell like a bum' s nut sac.
Fuck you.
Message one.
Mr. Soke?
This is Andrew Kaplan again, from the collection agency.
Message two.
This is Dolores Axelrod.
You ran into my car last week.
I called State Farm, but they have no record of any insurance policy for you.
In case you misplaced it, my phone number is 4...
Message three.
Willie, it' s Marcus.
It' s that time of year again.
Pack your shit.
Phoenix.
Jesus Christ!
Can you maybe keep it together for just 10 minutes?
Harrison, just let me explain, please.
Financially...
Well, you get what you paid for, Chipeska.
Five Christmases I' ve been here.
You flip me for some stranger who' il do it for peanuts and who happens to work with a real midget.
Nobody cares.
Nobody comes here for the elf.
Santa' s the attraction.
I do Burl Ives songs.
Does this schmo even play guitar?
Look, Harrison, it' s not about the money or the midget.
Believe me, if it was, I...
I don' t think they like "midget."
I think you' re supposed to call them...
Oh, just forget it.
Hacks!
Hi.
Welcome.
Great photo and résumé, by the way.
Thanks.
We' ve been at this a long time and all.
We' d like to think we do a good job.
I' m so glad you guys could come in on such short notice.
I must say, your look is just sensational.
Thanks.
We' ve been at this for years.
You got nothing to worry about.
You two are the best men for this job, truly.
So don' t let his unpleasantness affect your performance.
We' re fine.
- Performance?
Uh, your performance.
You know, the, um...
Performance, like sexual?
- Excuse me?
- Willie.
Are you saying there' s something wrong with my gear?
Is that what you' re saying?
- I' m sorry.
Your gear?
- Willie.
My fuck stick.
Hey, Willie.
Take a seat.
You know how your blood sugar is.
He' s not going to say "fuck stick" in front of the children?
No, no, no.
It' s a joke.
An adult joke for us adults.
It' s a joke.
Just a joke.
"Fuck stick"?
I thought it was very strange, too.
I wanted you to be aware.
But his little friend promised he wouldn' t say it in front of the children, which is fine.
Because, you know, there is an adult world and a child' s world, and that' s okay.
I' m no censor.
"Little friend"?
Yes, he happens to be a dwarf.
Or midget.
I don' t know what he' s called exactly.
But, uh, he' s a little guy.
Little Billy Barty.
God rest.
But thin fingers.
Not the fat sausage fingers.
"Little people."
That' s what they like.
Yes.
Uh, right.
Little people.
So "fuck stick."
That' s it?
Yeah.
Merry Christmas!
Yay!
Merry Christmas!
Yay!
Merry Christmas!
Have you seen that new Santa they just hired?
He' s back there drunk.
He' s coming, guys.
Santa will be here real soon.
God damn it!
What the fuck you doing?
You blow this, and we' re broke.
So stop acting like you know something.
'Cause, pal of mine, you don' t know squat!
Now, put on your hat and get out there.
And try to act professional, for Christ' s sakes.
What do you want?
What?
Get out of here.
Next.
Next.
Oh, good.
What do you want?
What do you want?
What are you doing?
God damn it!
Nintendo Deer Hunter 3.
I don' t give a shit what you want.
Blowing snot all over everybody and fucking whatever.
Next.
Come on.
What do you want?
- Um, Santa?
- Yeah, I' m Santa.
What do you want?
- Um, Barbie.
- Say cheese.
Barbie.
Oh, thank you.
Watch the toenails, kid!
Shit.
Next.
Next!
What do you want?
Fraggle- Stick car.
What the fuck is that?
Fraggle- Stick car.
Well, I heard you.
Fine.
Hey, check out this loser.
How you doing today?
Hey, loser.
Hey, dipshit.
Moron.
How you doing today?
Dumb- ass, why don' t you turn around?
Fuck this.
You' re next.
Next.
I said next, God damn it.
This is not the DMV, all right?
Move it along.
What' s your name?
You can tell me.
How about Santa?
If you don' t tell him, you won' t get a present.
That' s right.
Come on and tell Santa all about it.
What do you want?
Well, come on.
What do you want?
A snot- rag?
Another fucking Mongoloid.
Marcus, get this kid off me before he pisses on me.
Don' t fuck with my beard.
It' s not real.
No shit.
Well, it was real.
But, you see, I got sick and all the hair fell out.
How did you get sick?
I loved a woman who wasn' t clean.
Mrs. Santa?
No.
It was her sister.
What' s it like at the North Pole?
Like the suburbs.
Which one?
Apache Junction.
What the fuck do you care?
Now, get off my lap.
You sit there like a fucking retard.
You are really Santa, right?
No.
I' m an accountant.
I wear this fucking thing as a fashion statement, all right?
Okay.
Get this kid out of here.
He' s freaking me out.
I' il see you tomorrow.
Just don' t come into work stinking of booze again.
Yeah.
Why don' t you get going?
You' il be late for your "Wizard of Oz" Candy Bar Guild.
Lollipop Guild, you asshole.
Jesus!
Two- year- olds flip me shit better than you.
You saying something to me?
Yeah.
I' m gonna stick my whole fist up your ass.
What?
Another Grand- Dad, Santa?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Got a name?
Yeah.
So, what do you do, you know...
After the holidays, I mean.
Well, nothing till March, and then I' m the Easter Bunny.
Another?
Why not?
Merry Christmas.
Not a big talker.
No, not really.
- Buy you one?
- Why not?
Happy New Year.
You' re pretty regular for a Santa.
It' s not that big a fucking deal.
It' s just a job, you know what I mean?
I' m an eating, drinking, shitting, fucking Santy Claus.
Prove it.
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa!
Can' t I at least take this hat off?
I love the hat.
Okay.
I' ve always had a thing for Santa Claus.
In case you didn' t notice.
It' s like some deep- seated childhood thing.
So is my thing for tits.
Yeah.
It is like that, though.
From when you' re a kid.
'Cause my dad was Jewish, and we didn' t have Christmas.
So it was like this forbidden thing.
So...
I like you.
Don' t mothball that suit.
What the fuck?
I am not gay.
- What the hell, buddy?
- Buddy?
I said I am not gay.
Are you off your fucking meds or something?
Yes.
But that isn' t what this is about.
You' re as queer as a $10 bill.
Let me tell you something, motherfucker.
My brother lost a goddamn arm fighting you fuckers in Vietnam.
So I want you to look at my face one last fucking time.
This is the last thing you' re ever gonna see before I...
Elf fucker!
- Motherfucker!
- Turn around, elf fucker.
Who' s the bitch now, Santy Claus?
Huh?
Faggy Claus!
Faggy!
Leave Santa alone!
I am doing this for all of us.
Leave Santa alone!
Ass clown.
Hey, you' re that kid.
What the fuck are you doing here?
This one fucking time I take you home, okay?
Uh- huh.
I' m not your fucking dada.
Uh- huh.
It' s not like you helped me with that nutjob or anything.
- Uh- huh.
- You' re the right height.
You' re right there to grab his balls.
- You could twist them.
- Why do you need a car?
- What?
- This car.
Which turn is it?
Sage Terrace.
Where' s your sleigh?
It' s in the shop, getting repaired.
- Where are the reindeer?
- I stabled them.
Is it left or right?
That way.
Where' s the stable?
- Next to the shop.
- How do they sleep?
Who?
The reindeer?
Standing up.
But the noise.
How do they sleep?
- What noise?
- From the shop.
They only work during the day, all right?
I thought it was always night at the North Pole.
Well, not now.
Right now it' s always day.
Then how do they sleep?
- Oh, shit.
Sage Terrace.
What is it with you?
Somebody drop you on your fucking head?
On my head?
Are they gonna drop you on somebody else' s head?
How can they drop me onto my own head?
Would...
God damn it!
Are you fucking with me?
Okay.
Which house is it?
That one.
With Jesus and his family there or what?
No.
The one beside that.
- Right here?
- Yeah.
That one.
All right.
Nice digs.
Is Daddy home?
He' s on an adventure, exploring mountains.
He' s been gone a long time.
Exploring mountains, huh?
How long is he gonna be gone?
Till next year.
Yeah?
What about Mommy?
She lives in God' s house with Jesus and Mary and the ghost and the long- eared donkey and Joseph and the talking walnut.
Well, who the fuck takes care of you, then?
Grandma.
Yeah?
What' s her name?
Grandma.
Is Granny spry?
Everybody!
Grandma?
Grandma?
Santa' s here.
You' re home.
Are you spry?
Let me fix you some sandwiches.
Are you telling me she' s the only one here?
Nobody else?
No aunts or cousins or uncles or anything like that?
A butler or security guard or something?
Nuh- unh.
You' re shitting me.
Does your daddy have a safe?
Need money to fix your sleigh?
Exactly.
You want milk and cookies?
No.
Should I fix you some sandwiches?
Unh- unh.
Does your daddy have a car?
Bye, Santa!
- Keep going.
- Jesus!
Oh, God!
Oh, Zena!
Oh, Mary!
Keep it going.
Jesus Christ!
Yeah, baby.
Yeah, baby.
You ain' t gonna shit right for a week.
Oh!
- Yeah, buddy!
- Yeah!
It won' t happen again.
I can promise you that.
Willie here has low blood sugar.
That' s all.
That' s right.
I forgot to take my pill.
It' s not just the swearing.
Forgive me for prying.
But did one of you, um... fornicate...
Fornicate?
Yes, with a heavyset woman in the Big & Tall dressing room.
Look, I' ve boned a lot of fat chicks in my time, sure.
But as far as I can recall, I' ve never fornicated anybody.
Yes, well, even still,
I think it' s best for all parties considered if we...
If we what?
Well, I have someone else interested in the position.
Before you do something stupid, you may want to think about this shit.
What are you talking about?
I' m talking about firing a little black midget.
A colored, African- American small person.
That' s what I' m talking about.
I' m talking about your face all over goddamn "USA Today."
I' m talking about 150 of these little motherfuckers all over the sidewalk out there.
Little picket signs, chanting and raving.
Using little bullhorns and shit like that.
Screaming and hollering your name out.
Unfair practices.
Get me?
No.
No, no.
This is not a handicap thing.
I have nothing against you people.
"You people"?
Did you hear that, Marcus?
He said, "You people."
Who the hell is "us people"?
Wait.
No, no.
You don' t under...
What?
He...
No, no.
Um, you know, I think it' s best if we just forget we had this conversation.
Okay.
Good thinking.
And don' t worry about us.
We' il be fine.
Let' s get the hell out of here, Marcus.
You' re pathetic.
I dig that little thing on your belly button.
What' s that?
Like a diamond?
It' s a belly- button ring.
Oh, yeah?
Hang on a second.
Check this out.
You got to thrust.
See what I' m saying?
You gotta move the ball around.
You go up there, baby.
Come on.
Move the ball.
There you go.
Motherfucker!
Oh, you lousy, fucking motherfucker.
That' s the shit that' s gonna get us pinched.
She said she was 18.
But you promised no arcades.
You said you' d only hustle Big & Tall.
You shat me out of your womb?
You' re my fucking mom now?
I don' t need any goddamn lectures.
I know how to keep a low profile.
Thank you.
What the fuck is this, Mr. Low Profile?
Mind your own goddamn business.
Ever hear of the open bottle law?
A couple of days ago, I was in, uh, Women' s Big & Tall.
And I heard these...
Um, you know, these noises.
And I heard a woman screaming, "Yeah.
Oh, yeah. "
And I heard his voice saying, "That' s right.
You ain' t going to S- H- l- T right for a month. "
But don' t get me wrong.
I was against the Clinton impeachment.
What a man does with his own penis...
Oval Office, Women' s Big & Tall... it' s not for the American people to say.
Yeah, right.
But when you' re dealing with children...
They have a tender sensibility.
And you are in a position of trust.
I think perhaps someone who has screaming orgasms with large women shouldn' t...
Yeah.
Of course, I can' t fire him for that.
Oh, yeah.
Unfair practices.
Special pleading.
Bitch, bitch, bitch.
Fucking broads.
But I just can' t help it.
There' s something about the guy that makes me uneasy.
Well, sure.
Santa fucking someone in the ass.
- So...
Maybe there' s something I could fire him for.
Yeah, I get you.
Do you?
Do you think you could find something?
Shit, yeah.
There' s always something.
Shit.
Hey, Opal.
Come here.
Unh- unh.
Screw you, Willie, your kinky ass.
Last time I didn' t shit right for a week.
No, it' s not that.
I need to talk to you.
I' m just tired of you, Willie.
Ooh.
Who the fuck is in my room?
Did you see somebody go in my room?
Yeah.
Some guy asking about you.
Looked like a cop.
Oh, shit.
Marcus, it' s Willie.
I just got back to the motel.
Some guy is nosing around in my room.
What guy?
You get a look at him?
No.
But I think he' s a cop, though.
Think somebody' s onto us?
Is there anything in the room?
Anything professional?
No, I just got clothes in there.
Just ditch, you idiot.
You got anywhere to sack out for a while?
- Santa!
- Yeah.
You' re bringing my present early?
No.
But I never told you what I wanted.
I said I didn' t bring it, dipshit.
Okay.
Good.
I want a stuffed elephant.
A pink one.
Wish in one hand, shit in the other one.
See which one fills up first.
Okay.
So I' m gonna be staying here for a while.
Things are all fucked up at the North Pole.
Mrs. Santa caught me fucking her sister.
And I' m out on my ass now.
She got half of everything.
This is gonna be cool.
This will do fine.
So I' m gonna be crashing here.
It will be just you and me, like roommates, you know?
Do you and Mrs. Santa have kids?
No.
Thank the fuck Christ.
What about the elves?
Well, they stay with Mrs. Santa.
I get them on the weekends.
Why don' t you go run me a bath?
What about the reindeer?
Would you please shut up about reindeer?
What are their names?
Who?
The elves.
Oh, shit.
I can' t remember.
I think one of them is Sneezy.
There' s a Dopey.
That' s the Seven Dwarfs.
Oh, you' re shitting me.
I thought...
I was thinking it was the...
I don' t know.
Fuck, kid.
I just call them, "bub."
I say, "Hey, bub" or "chief" or whatever the fuck.
I tell him to make the goddamn toy.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I can' t remember this shit!
Does everything with you have to be a fucking test?
How old are they?
You want cookies?
No.
Warm milk?
No.
Should I fix you some sandwiches?
I don' t want any fucking sandwiches.
What is it with you and fixing fucking sandwiches?
Okay.
Do you want anything else?
No.
Okay.
Santa?
What?
I brought you some orange juice.
What' s in it?
Oranges.
Look what I have.
An Advent calendar.
What the hell is that?
It' s the story of Christmas, but in a calendar.
Every day you peel open a new box.
You get part of the story.
And then there' s a chocolate inside.
Do you want to open up today' s box and read it?
No.
You go ahead.
Jesus Christ, kid.
Watch the nuts.
"So Joseph went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem, the town of David.
In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.
Everyone went to his hometown to register. "
- That it?
- Yep.
That' s an awesome fucking story, kid.
There' s more to it, but we have to wait till tomorrow.
Do you want to eat the chocolate?
You go ahead.
Are you coming downstairs?
I' il be down in a minute.
I got to go to work.
Fuck me?
Fuck you.
You can' t just take up with some kid.
You don' t know who' s around or what they do.
You got some nerve, you little shit, you.
What, you' re my mom now?
You shat me out of your womb?
You said that yesterday, you stupid fuck.
Shit.
Fuck you.
You are by far the dumbest, most pathetic piece of maggot- eating shit that has ever slid from a human being' s hairy ass.
What if the kid has one of those fucking playdates they have now?
Are you shitting me?
The kid don' t have any friends.
He don' t even have an imaginary friend unless he ditched him.
He lives with his drooling- ass old grandmother.
Sits in front of the TV all the time.
You think she' s gonna rat me out?
She don' t know her ass from last Tuesday.
You fuck her?
Jesus Christ.
Is everything fucking sex with you?
With me?
I fuck one person.
'cause I can' t stand what a piece of shit I am.
What are you, Sigmund Sawed- off Fucking Freud?
Yeah, that' s right.
Go ahead.
Talk about my height.
'cause you' re an emotional cripple.
Your soul is dog shit.
Every single fucking thing about you is ugly.
Come on, Lois.
Let' s get out of here.
Look who' s here, Jimmy.
It' s Santa.
That' s fucking great.
Let' s tell him what you want for Christmas.
Fuck.
I' m on my fucking lunch break, okay?
Are you insane?
Management' s gonna hear about this.
You think that' s a threat?
If you think you can make my life any worse, go right ahead.
Take a shot.
Just looking.
Find everything you' re looking for?
Um, yeah.
Thank you.
Nothing I can help you with, huh?
No.
I' m just looking at the games' cause I have an Xbox.
Get your hands out of my pants, man!
You' re stealing from the store, you' re stealing from me.
What is this?
I was gonna pay for it.
Wrong answer.
When I look at you, you know what I think?
I think America has a sad future ahead of it.
And you' re part of this sorry- ass generation.
What you want to be when you grow up?
I don' t know.
- This MP3?
- Yeah.
Take it off.
But my grandmother gave...
Take it off.
I don' t care who gave it to you.
Take it off.
I don' t care if it choke you to death.
Get!
- But can I have...
- Get!
Happy Kwanzaa.
And pull your damn pants up!
What' s wrong with you kids these days?
Gin?
- Yeah.
- What do you need?
I need you to run a plate for me.
It' s Arizona plates.
Let me get a pen.
Is that it?
For Christ' s sake, make a move and stick with it, would you?
King me.
Son of a bitch!
You lousy, cheating little shit!
You' re fucking with me!
You did that on purpose.
You play like the dead lice are falling off of you, and then suddenly, you' re like Seabiscuit all over the place.
You' re a smartass, is what you are, kid.
Want to play again?
Howdy.
Herb Gunner.
I live two streets over on Burning Trail Road.
I don' t think we' ve met.
I' m Uncle Willie.
I' m organizing the decorations for the subdivision this year.
- You mind if I come in?
- Yeah.
I mean yeah, I mind.
Okay.
Uh...
Will you be participating in our luminarias program this year?
- What the hell is a lunamaria?
- They' re luminarias.
Small sacks filled with about a pound of sand each.
We insert a candle in the middle, light it, and the bag glows.
Then we line all the sidewalks here all around the neighborhood.
You see, we don' t celebrate Christmas around here, so...
We' re, uh, we' re Muslims.
Look, it' s my first year running this.
I' d like it if there weren' t any gaps in it.
What if I come by Christmas Eve and do it for you?
No, you know what?
You don' t have to do that.
Yeah, me and the kid here, we' il do something.
Great.
I got the supplies.
- I' il throw them in the garage.
- Perfect.
Awesome.
Going in the garage, just so you know.
Enough hot dogs and sausages to feed a small army.
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.
This is such a nice house.
Needs a woman' s touch, though.
I just rent the fucking place anyway.
I just rent stuff, too.
Yeah?
How long are you gonna be here?
What?
On the couch?
No.
In town.
I don' t know.
Just through the holidays.
You know, then I' il move on.
So, do you like kids?
Fuck, no!
Do you think I' m some kind of pervert?
I just mean because you' re Santa Claus.
Oh.
I really like kids.
- You do?
- I love kids.
Well, good.
Yeah, they' re something else, those kids.
And to tell you the truth...
The fact of the matter is, I' m not Santa.
Like ya anyway.
So, you' il call me, right?
Yeah.
I' il call you.
I' m gonna buy you some flowers.
Some of those really good expensive ones.
Shut up.
Bye.
Roger, you' re home.
Let me fix you some sandwiches.
What the fuck?
Kid, what the fuck is wrong with you?
Jesus Christ!
Let me see it!
Let me see it!
What the hell happened to you?!
Ow!
- Of course it was by mistake.
- Ow!
Here, hold still.
Hold still.
I was just trying to help you!
I forgot to say, "It' s gonna sting a little bit."
Shouldn' t I wrap it in a T- shirt or something?
God damn it.
- Hey, kid?
Kid, you okay up there?
You need a Band- Aid or something?
Aw, shit.
You' re late.
Kids.
Let me tell you.
They run you ragged.
Morning, team.
Hey, hey, hey.
It' s not quite 8: 00 yet.
Well, how close are we?
Now it' s 8: 00.
Merry Christmas.
Up your ass.
God damn it!
You tear your ball again?
I don' t think so.
That' s it.
God damn it!
Sweetheart, don' t romance 'em, now.
Go on and get in there.
I can take it.
Yeah.
Gin, I got the info on that Arizona plate.
All right.
Now you' re talking.
Oh, hold on one minute.
Baby, baby.
Baby, baby.
Don' t use that one.
That' s not the stuff.
Use something with some claws to it.
Yeah, that hard candy.
That' s it right there.
Let me get some of that.
Yeah, that' s it.
Okay.
Yeah, I' m back.
The guy' s Roger Merman.
- Guess where he is.
- Give it to me.
Damn it!
What' s wrong with you, woman?
Who are you?
Your name Roger Merman?
But...
You doing three to six for embezzlement?
Uh, well, many accounting questions are not cut- and- dried.
Do you live at 41 Sage Terrace?
Is it Grandma?
Is my son all right?
They' re fine.
Do you have any houseguests?
Houseguests?
Thank you for your time.
God bless.
Well, hey, who are you?
Houseguests?
Little trick I learned up at the North Pole.
If you fry baloney, it tastes like a hot dog.
I thought you didn' t like sandwiches.
Yeah, but this is not a sandwich.
A sandwich has two pieces of bread with a bunch of junk on it.
It' s like a tostada.
This isn' t a tostada.
There you go, Granny.
Little salsa here.
Now it' s a tostada.
Have you seen my Advent calendar?
What the fuck is it with the Advent calendar?
Why are you so obsessed with that goddamn thing?
The story sucks anyway.
I think I saw it in the hallway.
- Really?
- I think so.
Looks like someone messed with my Advent calendar.
What are you talking about?
Let me see.
Nobody messed with it.
It looks fine.
There' s a candy corn in this one.
Well, they can' t all be winners, can they?
Well, it' s fucked.
Yeah?
Yeah.
- Fucked, frankly.
- He' s...
- Clean...
- Oh.
- As a fucking whistle.
- Nothing?
- No.
- Oh.
I mean shit.
- Yeah.
- He curses.
- Yeah?
- But never around children.
- Oh.
- No criminal record.
- Yeah.
- No parking tickets.
- Nothing.
- Oh.
Sex, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- You can' t do shit about that.
- No.
Hell, I wouldn' t want to.
No, of course not.
I' m not advocating celibacy.
Hope not.
It' d be the end of the fucking human race.
Yeah.
Fucks large women.
What can I say?
Hey, look, it' s the retard again.
Wedgie.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Well, what the hell do you want?
Pokémon!
Done.
You probably shouldn' t be digging in your ass.
Santa...
Oh, jeez.
- Is that your underwear?
- Part of it.
Where the hell' s the rest of it?
No, actually, don' t tell me.
What do you want?
I was thinking I wanted a purple stuffed elephant, not pink.
But now I changed my mind.
- Yeah, what?
- Now I don' t want an elephant.
I want a gorilla named Davey for beating up the skateboard kids who pull on my underwear.
He could take his orders from the talking walnut, so it wouldn' t be my bad thing.
Jesus, kid.
When I was your age, I didn' t need no gorilla, and I wasn' t as big as one of your legs.
Four kids beat me up and I went crying to my daddy.
- You know what he did?
- He made it all better?
No, he kicked my ass.
You know why?
'Cause you went to the bathroom on Mommy' s dishes?
What the fuck?
He tried to teach you not to cry and be a man?
No.
It' s because he was a mean, drunk son of a bitch.
When he wasn' t busting my ass, he was putting cigarettes out on my neck.
The world ain' t fair.
You gotta take what you need when you can get it.
Learn to stand up for yourself.
Quit being a pussy.
Kick these kids in the balls or something.
Or don' t.
Shit, I don' t care.
Just leave me out of it.
Now, get on out of here.
Okay.
Thanks, Santa.
Go get the next lucky boy or girl, okay?
All right, next.
Open the ropes there, Marcus.
I know you?
Not yet.
Seven cities in seven years.
Pretty impressive.
The store changes, your name changes.
But you always get away clean.
Yeah.
Pretty darn impressive.
Well, let' s face the facts.
Y' all are a couple of half- bucket small- timers.
You, because of your physical attributes, found a niche, and I respect that.
But you also been caught...... by me.
So this is how it' s gonna be.
I don' t want to take over.
I don' t even want to change your scam.
Whatever you guys do, it works.
All I want is a taste.
When the deed is done, we part ways.
I' il buy a little ranch in Havasu, and you all take your little medicine show back on the road.
- How much?
- Half.
No way!
You don' t know who you' re fucking with.
Back off, Will.
I got this!
Okay.
30%.
There' s three of us.
30%.
That' s fair.
Half.
I meant 33%...
I meant half.... and 1/ 3.
Half.
35%.
Half.
40%.
Half.
42%.
Half.
45%.
Half.
48%?
Half.
49%.
Half.
Well, what' s one point?
We split the dough right down the middle.
Any merchandise you take, I get to look at and cherry- pick.
No!
Money' s one thing, but you ain' t gettin 'the...
This ain' t no Chinese menu, jagoff.
I tell you how it' s gonna be.
This is pricks fix.
Pricks fix?
He' s a fucking moron.
Oh, really?
Is that how you got the upper hand?
Fuck you.
Negotiating?
If you don' t like, next year, fuck off.
I can always get another box jockey.
I can get another midget, too.
Yeah, where?
You see us hanging off of trees like fucking crab apples?
Even if we did, you' d never front your own racket.
You know why, Willie?
You got no discipline.
You got zero fuckin 'initiative.
You' d fall apart without me.
You' re too pathetic for words.
You' re a fucking loser, and you fucking know it.
Santa' il be here real soon, kids.
Real soon.
Look.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God!
Sweet Jews for Jesus.
I pissed myself.
What the fuck do you think you doing?
You son of a bitch!
Hey, hey.
Hey, come on, come on.
Look, hey!
Come on, come on!
Look here.
Get him out of here.
I' il smooth things over with Chipeska.
- Tell him food poisoning.
- "Get him out of here"?
Take him to the car.
In case you hadn' t noticed, I' m a motherfuckin 'dwarf.
So unless you got a forklift handy, maybe you should lend a hand, hmm?
That figures.
You want all kind of set- asides.
Special treatment 'cause you' re handicapped.
You all the same.
Special treatment?
I' m 3- foot- fucking- tall, you asshole!
It' s a matter of physics.
Draw me a sketch of how I get him to the car, huh?
Bitch, bitch, bitch.
Sketch it up, you moron.
Fucking Leonardo da Vinci.
What you call me, thigh high?
I called you a fucking guinea homo from the 15th- fucking- century, you dickhead!
I could stick you up my ass, small fry.
Yeah?
You sure it ain' t too sore from last night?
You got some lip on you, midget.
Well, these lips were on your wife' s pussy last night.
Why don' t you dust that thing off once in a while?
Asshole.
I pissed my pants.
Oh, shut up.
Santa.
Santa?
What?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You going to work today?
Not really.
You just gonna sit there?
Yeah.
Just let me alone, okay?
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, kid?
Yeah?
I want you to take this letter.
When the paramedics come to bag Santa up, there' s gonna be some cops there.
I want you to make sure that those cops get that envelope.
What is it?
It just tells all the bad things that...
What the fuck happened to your eye?
Fucking little prick!
So you like to give little kids black eyes, huh?
How 'bout you, huh?!
You want some?!
Anybody else?
Anybody else?
Come on!
Yeah, there you go.
You know, I think I' ve turned a corner.
Yeah?
You fucking petites now?
No.
I' m not talking about that.
I beat the shit out of some kids today.
But it was for a purpose.
It made me feel good about myself.
It was like I did something constructive with my life.
I don' t know.
Like I accomplished something.
You need many years of therapy.
Many, many, many fuckin 'years of therapy.
Okay.
You don' t drink, which is smart on your part.
But being sober can put you at a disadvantage when it comes to violence.
I can' t box worth a shit, see.
But I' m good in a fight because I can' t feel anything.
You, you' re gonna feel everything.
Okay.
Now put your dukes up.
Let me see what you got.
This is bullshit!
Give me one good reason why I should even consider doing this.
'Cause I let 2, 000 kids spit in my face for your ass.
That' s why.
Now, I' m asking you for this one thing.
Come on, look at the kid.
He is pathetic.
Yeah, he' s just a little...
He' s a fucking retard.
Yeah, let' s show him a couple of things so he can defend himself, then.
Unless you' re scared.
All right, here' s what' s gonna happen.
Marcus is a bully, right?
He' s gonna pull your underwear up out of your pants.
Now, what do you do?
I don' t know.
God damn it!
You don' t know?
If somebody wants to pull your underwear up out of your pants, you have to get mad.
Yeah, kid, come on.
Get mad.
Scream at him.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Listen at him.
He' s a fucking faggot.
Loud!
Scream!
Be loud!
Be mean!
Piss him off!
Come on!
You don' t hit people in the balls, you asshole!
What the fuck' s wrong with you?
He' s just a kid.
- Ow!
God damn it.
I told you I didn' t want to do this!
Ohh!
Oh, shit.
Kid, maybe you shouldn' t spend so much time around me.
You sneaky little prick.
Fuck you!
Little bastard!
Get off me!
Shut up.
That' s not even what you said.
Oh, God damn it, I forgot about that.
We got a fucking nursing home around here.
Well, we can go in another room.
She does look kind of still, doesn' t she?
Hey, Granny?
Hey, Granny.
Hey, there, Granny?
Oh, Granny.
Oh, my God.
What the fuck?
Oh, shit.
- Roger!
- God!
- God damn it!
Shit!
- You' re home.
- Let me fix some sandwiches.
Hello, little boy.
Hello.
Santa...
I know that Christmas Eve is in a couple days, and you have to fly around the world and give presents to everyone, and you won' t be around anymore.
Yeah?
So I thought I' d give you your present now.
What the fuck is it?
It' s a wooden pickle.
- Why' d you paint it brown?
- It' s not paint.
It' s blood from when I cut my hand making it for you.
Oh.
Well, shit, kid, I don' t know.
I...
Thanks.
You' re welcome.
Good night, Santa.
Good night, Mrs. Santa' s sister.
Good night, sweetie.
Oh, my God.
That was so sweet.
He' s a really sweet kid, isn' t he?
Yeah, I guess so.
Come on, baby.
Come here.
What?
I' m all right.
Just a little tired.
Santa!
God damn it!
Shit!
Want to see my report card?
You scared the holy shit out of me.
Think I did good?
How would I know?
I haven' t seen the fuckin 'thing yet.
Who the fuck is Thurman?
- Is your name Thurman?
- Yeah.
Thurman Merman?
Yeah.
Jesus.
So, you think I did good?
What do you care what I think, anyway?
Hell, I guess you did better than I did.
I never got any B' s.
I thought maybe at least since I did good in school, maybe you' d bring me a present.
'Cause last year and the year before that, you didn' t bring me any presents.
Even though I' m a dipshit loser.
Jesus fucking Christ, kid!
Why do you talk about yourself that way?!
Let me give you some news.
I' m not Santa Claus, all right?
Take a look at me.
Do I look like Santa Claus?
As a matter of fact, I' m living fucking proof that there' s not a Santa Claus.
I know there' s no Santa.
'cause we' re friends.
There he is.
That lousy, leather- faced, frog- eyed, motherfucker.
- Good night, Gin.
- Good night.
Jesus, Mother Mary, and Joseph.
What is the problem now?
The van stalled.
Will you give us a jump, please?
I' il be dipped in dog shit.
Do I look like an auto mechanic to you?
I appreciate it.
All right, small fry, help yourself.
I can' t reach it.
Jesus Christ, give me that.
Thanks.
All right, hit it.
What a terrible accident.
- Is he dead?
- No.
But it looks like you broke most of his ribs.
I' d say maybe 50% of them, or do you think 30%?
I needed more of a running start.
I couldn' t build up enough speed.
Merry Christmas Eve.
Got you a little something.
You shouldn' t have.
You should put that stuff in the kitchen.
God damn, you look good.
Here you go.
Little behind there, sweetie?
We don' t need any more of this shit.
"Christmas keeps us connected to each other in peace.
The angel is going to tell everyone in the world. "
Aspirin?
Shit!
Jesus.
Santa?
- What?
- I was gonna make sandwiches.
I could make you one before you leave.
Listen, kid, I don' t know.
I got shit to do and everything.
Okay, make me some sandwiches.
I gotta go to the mall and talk to somebody.
I' il be back.
For dinner?
Yeah, that' s what I said.
Yeah.
How many sandwiches do you want?
Uh, a bunch.
How much lettuce do you want?
The usual amount.
Whatever the hell people do.
Whatever you think.
Okay.
Have a very merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- Good night.
Merry Christmas.
Good night.
- Good night.
Happy holiday!
Attention, shoppers.
The store will be closing in five minutes.
We wish you all a merry Christmas, a happy Hanukkah, and a joyous Kwanzaa.
All right, hold it steady.
Oh, yeah, shit, let' s do it.
Oh, Christ.
Merry Christmas.
Good night.
Merry Christmas, Willie.
Up your ass.
Oh, shit.
What?
What?
It' s a Kitnerboy Redoubt.
So?
Remember Andy Pitz?
Andy Pitzorella?
Yeah.
No, Andy Ripitski.
Andy Pitzorella was Andy Blue Balls.
Since he got married, they call him Andy Pitzorella.
What' s your fucking point?!
They say he can get into anything.
Anything.
They say he' s been in Margaret Thatcher' s pussy.
And that' s a good thing?
So what the fuck are you getting at?
When I was in the joint with him, he told me that the Kitnerboy Redoubt can' t be cracked.
Are you shittin 'me?
Are you telling me that after I propped you up, held you together, smiled for all those kids, danced for all those fucking housewives in a fucking lime- green, fucking velvet elf costume, that you cannot get in this fucking safe?!
Huh?!
No, I' m just saying it' s gonna take a minute.
Fuck.
Shit.
34C.
Fuck!
Piece of cake.
I gotta get one more thing.
I' il be right back.
Oh, shit.
Which one did he say?
I' il bet the store dick don' t want this.
Store dick don' t want shit.
What do you mean?
Store dick' s dead.
Store dick don' t want shit.
He' s dead, huh?
I didn' t even know he was sick.
Willie... this has been a long time coming.
Every year, you' re worse.
Every year, less reliable.
More booze.
More bullshit.
More buttfucking.
Sure, the three B' s.
You gotta be able to rely, Willie.
You people are monsters.
There' s no joy in this for me.
I' m not talking about you taking me out.
That part, I get.
But look at all that shit.
Do you really need all that shit?
For Christ sakes, it' s Christmas.
It is Christmas, Willie.
But this is what we do.
We get the shit.
Christmastime, we get the shit.
Because we are men and Lois.
It is Christmas, Willie.
And we are men and Lois.
What you waiting for, honey?
Come on, plug him.
Goodbye, Willie.
- Drop the gun.
- Huh?!
And you, Santa, drop the elephant.
- Where did you come from?
- Tipped off.
Shit, that fucking kid.
All three of you are in so much shit, it' s almost unbelievable.
Marcus, hop on!
Fuck me.
Hey, hey!
This is Christmas, and the kid' s getting his fucking present.
Halt, police!
Put your hands up!
Freeze!
"Dear kid...
I hope that you got my present and that there wasn' t too much blood on it, although there was blood on the present you gave me, which didn' t keep me from enjoying it.
So maybe the blood doesn' t matter so much, I guess. "
I' m also sending you a T- shirt.
I hope it' s the right size. "
"I' m healing up good, and they tell me that I will soon be 100%, even with 8 bullets dug out of me, because they didn' t hit any vital organs, just my liver, which is fucked anyway.
Ha ha ha.
Thank you for giving that letter to the cops.
I forgot I asked you to do it, but it' s a good thing you did or Santa' s little helper would' ve plugged his ass.
Now the cops know I wrote it, which is gonna keep my ass out of jail.
That, plus everyone agreeing that the Phoenix police shooting an unarmed Santa was even more fucked up than Rodney King. "
"The cops are treating me like fucking royalty now, which is new in my experience.
They' re gonna make me a sensitivity counselor so that tragedies like this will never again embarrass the whole fucking department.
I told the cops you had no one to take the fuck care of you, so they set it up with Mrs. Santa' s sister watching you till your dad gets back in one year and three months.
They made her a guardian pro tem or some such shit.
Anyway, she seems to like you and your house and Jacuzzi.
I sent her some money, so if you play your cards right, you can probably get her to buy you something.
As for my little helper, I' m sorry to have to tell you that him and his prune- faced, mail- order wife are gonna be exploring mountains with your dad.
like I did.
They' re supposed to let me out of this hospital room soon, so get some sandwiches ready.
Until then, don' t take no shit from nobody,
least of all yourself.
Ho ho ho.
Your pal, Santa. "
Hey, loser.
I hear your buddy' s not here to protect you anymore.
See you got me a new bike.
Thanks a lot.
I' m talking to you, fat- ass!
Hey, Timmy, get me a hot dog.
Hey, Dave.
I like your Dukes of Hazzard T- shirt.
Well, thanks, Sara.
I like your CHiPs T- shirt.
- Thanks.
- Fun party, huh?
Yeah.
Except for Arnie Shankman being here.
Wedgie!
Wedgie!
Wedgie!
I feel bad for him with his sister losing her mind and all.
Whatever.
You know what we should do?
Play Truth or Dare.
- You want to?
- Sure.
Okay, I' il go first.
Truth or dare?
Truth.
Have you ever kissed a girl before?
- Well, l -- - Family doesn' t count.
- Maybe I' il take dare.
- Okay.
I dare you to kiss me.
Right here?
Yeah.
I want everyone to see that your first kiss is with me.
Got any mustard for that cocktail frank, butt- lick?
- David Buznik.
- I just landed in St. Louis.
- I hope you wrote my speech.
- I did, sir.
I pulled an all nighter.
I look forward to this, Mr. Head.
Never been to St. Louis.
Thank you for allowing me to come on this trip --
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, that sounds great.
If we finish our work, I' d love to go to a jazz club.
Terrific.
- Yes.
Yes, he did.
He' s a jerk.
You came up with the idea for the Husky Cat clothing line.
He didn' t say thank you.
He should give you a promotion.
There' s a creative executive position that just opened up, so....
Bring that up on the trip.
You gotta stick up for yourself.
I know.
I' il figure something out.
I gotta go.
Sorry.
I' m gonna miss you.
That guy' s looking at us.
You know I don' t like it when people watch me kiss.
I' m sorry.
Take care.
Okay.
Bye.
Dave....
- Have a good flight.
- Okay.
I' m sorry.
I think you' re in my seat.
Come on, pal.
I' m already settled in here.
Can' t you sit somewhere else?
You' re supposed to sit in the seat they assigned you.
Nobody cares.
Just sit in the seat I' m supposed to sit in.
Excuse me.
This seat' s available.
Okay.
Thank you.
You' re very welcome.
No air.
That' s too bad, huh?
You' re on my side of the armrest.
We' re not gonna have problems, are we?
No.
I' m wetting my Jockeys here.
You gotta get a load of this, keed.
I mean, you like comedies?
I just haven' t been sleeping a lot lately so I was trying to catch some....
Look at this actress here.
What is your position on breast implants?
This guy.
I can just watch the movie with you.
Excuse me.
- Could I get a headset?
- Certainly.
Thank you.
Probably make out with my next boyfriend.
Oh, my God, it was disgusting.
Miss?
I' il be right there, sir.
Where' s your headset?
She' s busy right now, but it' s coming.
For crying out loud.
You' re missing important plot points.
Ma' am?
Could you give me a second, sir?
Excuse me.
Could I maybe get that headset, please?
- Do not raise your voice to me, sir.
- I wasn' t raising my voice.
Just calm down.
I just want my headset.
Our country is going through a difficult time now.
If you won' t cooperate --
I don' t know where a headset ties into patriotism.
Is there a problem here, sir?
I don' t think so.
Can you come to the back with me so we can have a talk?
A talk about what?
There' s not a problem.
- The stewardess just keeps -- - Flight attendant.
The flight attendant keeps ignoring me when --
Calm down.
I am calm.
What is it with you people?
"You people"?
Now wait a minute.
I don' t mean you people.
I mean you people.
I will not tolerate any racist behavior on the plane.
This is a difficult time for our country.
I' m not a racist.
I just want to watch the movie.
I' m only going to say this one more time, sir.
Calm down.
I' m calm!
All rise.
- What do you think?
It' s a no- brainer.
Mr. Buznik.
In case 723, assault and battery against a flight attendant...... I find you guilty.
I' m ordering you to pay a fine of $3500.
Thank God you' re okay.
In addition, to prevent further acts of rage...... this court orders you to undergo 20 hours of anger management therapy.
Anger management?
Oh, my goodness.
Bobby Knight.
- Oh, yeah.
This is my first day.
- It' s my first day also.
- I hope this class cures me.
Working on the anger problem?
Anger?
Isn' t this Sexaholics Anonymous?
No.
I think that' s down the hall.
Well, the hell with this!
I' m going home!
Dr. Rydell?
You don' t remember me, do you?
- I sat next to you on the plane.
- Oh, yeah, the headset guy.
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.
That was a crazy flight.
They actually sentenced me to anger management for that.
Really?
Wow.
This is incredible.
You could sign this for me...... and tell them I don' t have an anger problem if you want.
I can' t just sign your papers.
I didn' t do anything wrong.
You know that.
All right.
How' s this?
Just hang for one session...... so I can at least say I gave you a proper analysis.
- Then I' il sign your papers.
- Okay.
- Shall we?
- Oh, yes.
Yes.
So my boss, he was talking to me about how many sick days I' ve taken.
So my boss, he was talking to me about how many sick days I' ve taken.
And I was like, you know, "Don' t go there."
But he kept on about wanting to see a doctor' s note or something.
And I said, "Look, I' m seriously serious.
You don' t want to go there. "
But he kept talking and talking, being such a nag...... and then I just blacked out.
I blacked out.
And when I woke up, I was standing over him and I was screaming:
"I told you not to go there!
I told you not to go there! "
How do you feel you handled that situation?
Not as well as I could' ve.
Remember, Lou, temper' s the one thing you can' t get rid of by losing it.
Now, Fury Fighters, let' s say hello to someone...... who' s joining our quest to get the anger monkeys off our backs:
- Dave.
- Hi, Dave.
Hi.
Good news, I fed my anger monkey a banana this morning...... and he' s feeling much better.
More good news, you won' t have to listen to those lame jokes...... because I' m only here for one session.
Dave assaulted a female flight attendant in midair.
- Nice.
- I bet you beat her good.
I didn' t beat anybody.
I touched a woman.
Liar.
Bullshitter.
You' re a woman beater.
You can' t admit it because you' re a piece of garbage.
I don' t know about all that, but now I understand why you' re here.
I' m here because I was verbally attacked by my neighbor.
And I took a dump on his porch.
I guess you' re better than me.
That' s why you can' t cop to your rage.
You' re superior.
He' s superior.
- Maybe Dave' s not ready yet, Chuck.
- You' re not ready.
Hear what he said?
Let' s introduce Dave to some of the rest of us.
Girls, why don' t you tell Dave what brought you here.
I' m sure he' d love to listen to what you guys have to say.
We always do.
Join us.
- Okay.
Okay.
Well, we' re in the adult film industry.
And we' re lovers.
One day, Gina was having sex with this Filipino guy Melo...
-... which was cool, it was in the script.
- Sure.
And then I asked Melo back to the house with us...... which is cool, because, well, we like a little variety.
Variety' s good.
So anyway, in the middle of our session...... I look up and I see Gina kissing Melo on the mouth...... which is not cool because it violates our threesome code of ethics.
- Stacy bit my toe off.
- Then Melo freaks out...
-... and calls me a crazy skank.
- Nobody talks to my bitch that way.
- So I stapled his lips shut.
- Here we are.
Well, we' ve all been there.
- I like him.
- Yeah, he' s funny.
Not as funny as you.
I like that.
- All right, girls.
- Let it go.
Let it go a little bit longer.
Walk it off.
Nate.
Didn' t we decide that you shouldn' t listen to the ball game?
Don' t worry, Dr. B, it' s just a regular season game.
Not important.
He missed the lay- up!
See?
Iverson just missed a lay- up at the buzzer, Sixers lose.
Who gives a crap, huh?
I mean, it' s just a silly game, anyways.
The anger sharks are swimming in my head.
You gotta dunk that shit!
You gotta dunk that shit!
Listen to me.
Stay with me, Nate.
Now, repeat after me, Nate:
Goosfraba.
Goos blah blah.
Not "blah blah," Nate.
Goosfraba.
Goosfraba.
That' s good.
Slower.
Goosfraba.
How do you feel?
Better.
Good job, Nate.
That sound is a derivation of an old Eskimo word...... that mothers used to calm their children.
- I see.
- Eskimos seem nice.
- They do.
- I think Eskimos are smug.
Hold that thought, Chuck.
So, Dave...... tell us about yourself.
Who are you?
Well, I am an executive assistant...... at a major pet products company.
I don' t want you to tell us what you do.
I want you to tell us who you are.
All right.
I' m a pretty good guy.
I like playing tennis on occasion....
Also, not your hobbies, Dave, just simple:
Tell us who you are.
I just....
Maybe you could give me an example of what a good answer would be.
What did you say?
You want Lou to tell you who you are?
No, I just....
I' m a nice, easygoing man.
I might be a little bit indecisive at times.
Dave, you' re describing your personality.
I want to know...
-... who you are.
- What the hell do you want me to say?
I mean, I' m sorry.
I just....
I want to answer your question.
I' m just not doing it right, I guess.
I think we' re getting a picture, Dave.
- Let' s move on.
- Dr. Rydell, I' d like to know something.
Why is it that Chuck thinks he can smoke?
I do whatever I want when I want, you little Spanish fruit topping.
Honey, at least I didn' t make my aunt pregnant.
What are you laughing at, Dave?
Just laughing.
I don' t know.
I' m not laughing at you.
Were you laughing with me?
Because I' m not laughing.
Am I out of line, or is this guy pushing me?
Well, how do you feel, Chuck?
I went from happy to angry, skipped sad.
Now I feel like kicking his ass.
Then we' il see who' s laughing.
What?
Think you' re better than me because you' ve got both your nuts?
All right, man.
All right.
Come on.
Come on, big boy.
Pretty boy.
All right.
Is it worth going back to the penitentiary, Chuck?
- So he' s laughing at you.
- I' m not laughing at him.
Goosfraba.
- Goosfraba.
- Okay.
Good job, Chuck.
That was really good.
Where' s the coffee cake?
I was looking forward to it.
Where' s the coffee cake?
I was looking forward to it.
I haven' t been to the Actors Studio in quite some time.
- I' m sure your audition will go well.
- Thanks.
I hope so.
- Good night.
- All right.
- Thanks, Buddy.
- Bye- bye.
That was a little bit insane.
If I had to do 20 hours of that, I' d end up killing myself.
Here you go.
Twenty hours in my class would be pointless for you.
I agree.
I think I' m going to recommend to the court that we double your time.
What do you mean?
Let me explain something.
There are two kinds of angry people: explosive and implosive.
Explosive is the kind of individual that you see screaming at the cashier...... for not taking their coupons.
Implosive is the cashier who remains quiet, day after day...... and finally shoots everyone in the store.
You' re the cashier.
No.
I' m the guy hiding in the frozen food section dialing 911, I swear.
I' m going to assign you an anger ally...... to help calm you down when you' re losing it.
Chuck.
Not Chuck.
Give me Bobby Knight, or the porno girls.
Heard we' re partnering up, huh?
- Yes.
- Here' s my number.
Great.
"You' re going to die, bitch."
Oops, that' s a letter I' m writing to Geraldo Rivera.
- I see.
- My bad.
Here.
That' s the number.
Good.
Thank you.
Dave and Chuck...... working together as a team.
- It' s a win- win situation.
- Yeah, feels it.
Dave' s particulars.
I' il see you soon.
The Yanks are great this season.
Dave thinks they could beat Seattle' s win record.
Remember at Brown when we saw Ron Guidry win his 20th?
Oh, man.
He was on fire that year.
We could' ve been too.
Andrew, don' t start or I can' t hang out with you anymore.
Sorry, it' s just hard.
I' il never meet anyone as good as you.
You will.
She' il be a very lucky lady.
Thanks for being my best friend.
Linda.
- Hey, Dave.
- Andrew.
Good to see you guys hugging.
How was the doctor?
Psychotic.
Well, did you get any good promotion news from Mr. Head?
I wasn' t able to talk to him about that yet, but I will.
Not that crowded here.
You' d think it would be packed.
I rented the place.
I figured it' d be more fun if it was just Brown alumni.
Where' d you go to college again?
Trenton Community College.
You had a hard day.
Let me buy you a milk shake.
Later, Andrew. -- once you cast your line in, so during retrieval...... it' il help you to create a realistic and a erratic....
Hey, Dave.
- Hey.
Andrew, what' s up?
- Not much.
You always try to simulate live bait.
Okay, they got fishing while you go to the bathroom.
That' s nice.
Yep.
Bass fishing.
Hey, he caught one.
Oh, yeah.
Congratulations.
Now that is a big one, folks.
Always a blast being with your friends.
It was a great night.
Yankees winning, beer and hot dogs.
Yeah, you like those foot- Iong hot dogs, don' t you?
So I saw your boy Andrew at the urinal.
Saw his...
-... thing.
- You were looking?
Yeah, unfortunately.
So, now, did this guy grow up near a nuclear power plant or something?
What are you talking about?
Never really seen nothing like that before.
Didn' t it used to scare you?
I never saw it.
You never saw it?
No, I told you, I never slept with him.
Why, is it huge?
No.
No.
No.
No.
It' s actually quite petite.
I felt bad for him.
It looked like it belonged on a baby and it had a funny color.
I bet he got a lot of snickers in the locker room.
Like, "What the hell' s that thing?"
When you' re in a locker room, you must feel good about yourself.
I do.
If there are 20 naked guys in there, I' m usually in the top 18.
- Which isn' t bad.
- You' re doing really good.
Thanks.
- Who' s that?
- I don' t know.
Let me get rid of them.
- Hello?
- Dave, it' s me, Chuck.
- Who' s Chuck?
- Your anger ally.
I' m in a mood, Dave.
A bad mood.
A very bad mood.
I was fired from my ice- cream truck job today.
No more Fudgeicles.
- What' s an anger ally?
- Who' s that?
She making fun of me?
No.
That' s my girlfriend.
You tell her to put a sock in it because I need to talk to you right now!
We' re a little busy right now.
You' re busy?
We' re all busy, okay?
You come down here before a black wolf swallows my brain!
After I got kicked out of the Army, I went through a real bad time:
Hookers, booze, shooting holes in the ceiling, screaming myself to sleep.
Finally, my parents said I had to move out.
I' m guessing that' s when you decided to shack up with your aunt.
Don' t get cute, wiseass!
But, yes.
What' s with the watch, huh?
Am I boring you?
We ordered the drinks 15 minutes ago and I kind of gotta get back.
Miss?
Excuse me, miss?
Is this Slow And Stupid Waitress Day?
I' m sorry.
I be right with you.
Damn, man, reminds me of these chicks back in the war.
Would give you the old licky- licky, then fry your banana.
Settle.
I have seen some shit, man.
I kid you not, I have seen some shit.
Wake up to the sound of kids screaming.
Explosions everywhere.
Never know when your number' s up.
Vietnam, huh?
- Grenada, man.
- Grenada?
Wasn' t that like 12 hours long?
Did you see that?
- See what?
- That guy.
He just gave me a look.
He didn' t give you a look.
And I' m pretty sure I heard him mutter some kind of anti- Semitic remark.
Are you Jewish?
I could be.
But, no.
Half Irish, half Italian, half Mexican.
Let' s go give those guys some tsuris.
Well, the guy on the left is blind, Chuck.
I hear you.
He' s yours.
No.
That' s not what I was saying.
- Hey.
- What the hell?
Got something against guys with hair?
What' s going on?
Don' t!
Stop it!
Stop!
Stop!
Goosfraba!
You piece of shit!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Welcome back, Mr. Buznik.
I see you' ve managed to brutalize a cocktail waitress this time.
I guess beating up stewardesses can get old after a while.
Flight attendant, Your Honor.
I didn' t hit her on purpose, Your Honor.
I was being attacked by someone...... and while I was trying to take away his....
His....
Trying to take away my cane, Your Honor.
You cracked a waitress in the face...... while attempting to steal a blind man' s cane?
Your Honor, we' re not even sure how blind this man really is.
Okay.
My bad.
Moving on.
Happy now, ass- wipe?
Mr. Buznik, I don' t know why you hate women.
Maybe you don' t know either...... but I' il let you think about it while you spend one year in a state prison.
- Isn' t that a bit harsh, Your Honor?
- No!
Okay.
- May I approach, Your Honor?
- By all means, Dr. Rydell.
Thank you.
- It' s been a while.
- Yes, it has.
- You look marvelous, Brenda.
- Thank you.
- And how are the boys?
- Fantastic.
James made the basketball team, Raheem landed the lead...... in Fiddler on the Roof.
Raheem will make a breathtaking Tevye, I' m sure.
So do you have a take on this Buznik guy?
Is this good or bad?
Well, it' s bad that he' s talking to her...... but it' s good that....
No, it' s bad.
It' s all bad.
- You think you can help him?
- I think so, Your Honor.
If I can' t, I' il tear him apart with my bare hands.
Mr. Buznik...... because of the enormous respect I have for Dr. Rydell...... I' m placing you in his intensive anger management program...... for 30 days.
But if you fail to strictly adhere to the rules of his program...... you will spend the next year in state prison.
- Buddy?
- Good evening.
Ready to get it on?
Get what on?
What are you doing here?
Well, well, well.
The lair of the rage rhino.
I smell the effluvium of pain and frustration.
- Where should we put my stuff?
- What stuff?
We' ve got 30 days to control your anger.
My approach dictates intense observation.
What better vantage point than bunkmates?
Put that there, Dan, thank you very much.
No.
No.
I' m sorry.
Guys, I don' t think you should be moving in with me.
Sit down, Dave.
Let' s be perfectly clear about this.
You' ve been deemed a threat to society.
I believe that radical, round- the- clock therapy...... is the only way to effect a meaningful and positive change...... in your behavior.
Now we can do it here or Rikers Island.
- Anything else, Dr. B?
- No thanks, Dan.
We' il install the wiretaps tomorrow.
Wiretaps?
- Is this your CD collection?
- Yes.
Oh, my.
What are you doing?
I don' t want you listening to any angry music.
The Carpenters are angry?
I mean....
Don' t be naive, Dave.
"Close to You."
"We' ve Only Just Begun."
Songs of madness and obsession.
Who' s going to pay for that?
Retard your anger level a few notches and listen to me.
Can you do that?
Yeah.
It' s retarded.
I' m retarded.
Good.
Now then, we need to go over some ground rules.
My girlfriend got me that.
You' re to refrain from violent acts including verbal assault...... and vulgar hand gestures.
You may not use rage- enhancing substances...... such as caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, crack cocaine...... Slippy- Flippies, Jelly Stingers, Trick Sticks...... Bing Bangs or Flying Willards.
- How about Fiddle Faddles?
- Under my supervision.
Also, if you are unable to stop masturbating...... please do so without the use of any pornographic images...... depicting quote- unquote "angry sex."
That having been said, I' m a pretty good guy...... and I think you' il be pleasantly surprised...... at how much fun we can have.
Jeez, without Slippy- Flippies or angry masturbating?
How is that possible?
Sarcasm is anger' s ugly cousin.
From now on, unacceptable.
Dave, I got this for you.
It' s a wonderfully therapeutic tool.
Record your thoughts on this whenever you feel angry.
I' m feeling very angry right now...... because I only have one bed and no couch.
Not a problem.
In Europe, it' s not considered unusual for three or four men to share a bed.
Yeah, well, that' s why I' m proud to be an American.
By the way....
I like to sleep in the nude.
You hear that frog?
Nope.
What do you want?
I' m just recording your demeanor upon awakening.
Good to see you got your underwear back on.
6: 30?
I don' t gotta be up till 7.
You' ve got to make my breakfast.
Dave, cooking is very relaxing and therapeutic.
I want two eggs, over easy and unfertilized...... wheat toast, dry, and please...... tell me you' ve got ketchup.
There' s a Denny' s down the street.
Not only do they have ketchup...... but they got the angriest waitresses I' ve seen.
You could have a blast with the goosfraba thing down there.
Lame- o.
Your eggs.
- Holy shit!
- I said over easy!!
Now, why did I do that?
Because I refused to spoon with you last night?
The angry man opens his mouth and shuts his eyes.
Alpha- Bits.
No matter how old I get, always a culinary delight.
No explanation for the egg throwing.
He' s a psycho.
Don' t sulk, Dave.
Eat.
Sit down.
We' il be off to work in a jiffy.
"We' il be off to work." Now, by "we' Il," I assume you mean just me, right?
Well, I have to join you at work.
Full contact.
That will make me look nuts, Buddy, bringing a shrink to work...... you whipping eggs at people.
I don' t know.
You must never be ashamed that you sought help for yourself, Dave.
It' s not a weakness.
I mean, I gotta be there by 9: 00.
I don' t think we' il make it on time.
You' re not even dressed.
"Wherever you look...... there' s something to be seen."
Look, Dave.
- What exactly was that all about?
You just ran through a red light.
Are you trying to get us both killed?
I' m a little flustered right now.
I have to be to work in eight minutes.
Flustered?
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa, man!
- Holy shit!
What are you doing?
- I need you to unfluster.
My boss is going to go nuts on me if we' re late, so please?
We will proceed when you are centered.
I' m centered, I' m centered.
There' s 10, 000 people behind us.
Let' s go, crazy man.
What is that?
Is that good?
We' re going to sing a song.
No.
I don' t want to sing a song.
I' ve gotta go.
Here we go.
The magic of Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim' s...... West Side Story.
"I Feel Pretty."
Get this moving.
What the hell' s your problem?
Shut your pie- hole!
We' re working here!
Wow.
Sorry.
Move your ass, dipshit!
Burn in hell!
Yes!
You' re late.
Yes.
There was a little bit of a tie up on the bridge.
I didn' t ask for a traffic report.
You' re always late.
Now is the first time I' ve been late.
But you' re right.
I' m sorry.
May I interject?
You were about to say something else before you said, "I' m sorry."
We mustn' t absorb and repress.
- Who' s this?
- I' m his anger management therapist.
You' re in anger management?
Temporarily, yeah.
Do you remember the flight to St. Louis...... that I was on when they had to turn the plane around?
Yeah, yeah.
Because of that unruly passenger in coach.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
He doesn' t like people touching his clubs.
Well, that unruly passenger was me.
I got arrested at Kennedy.
That' s why I didn' t make the next flight.
You said your apartment caught fire.
Dissembling is a common tool of the anger junkie.
Might I have your first name, Mr. Head?
And tell me it isn' t Dick.
- It' s Frank.
- Fran.
Isn' t that normally a girl' s name?
What went on on that flight?
To be honest with you, it was a mix- up.
I....
Jibber jabber.
Jibber jabbering.
Mumbo jumbo.
Denial.
Key, key, key, key, key, key.
Fran, your assistant beat the bejesus out of a flight attendant.
- I didn' t.
- You broke her nose.
I broke the cocktail waitress' s nose.
I mean, I accidentally did that.
Dave, you have a disease.
Would you apologize if you were a diabetic?
Of course not.
Why do you feel you have to apologize because you' re suffering from T. A. S.?
T. A. S.?
Toxic Anger Syndrome.
I don' t have T. A. S.
He' s angry.
It' s a sickness, not a crime, Fran.
His name is Frank!
No.
I' m sorry.
Clothes for cats isn' t really a new idea...... but there was never really a line made for overweight cats...... who might feel a little self- conscious...... about how they look in certain outfits.
That' s why I got the baggy sweater on him, to cover up his gut.
And the beret to take attention off his plump head.
Oh, little Meatball.
You tie this up tight...... and away goes the chin.
I' m so handsome.
- Hey, Dave.
This is your office?
- Andrew.
- What are you doing here?
- I played golf with Frank.
He' s friends with my dad.
We' re members of the same country club.
Really?
I' ve been wanting to play golf with him a long time.
- Is it awesome there?
- It' s nice.
So, anyway, Dave, how' s anger management going?
Who told you about that?
Linda' s my best friend.
There' s no secrets between us.
For the love of Mike!
This guy' s your girl' s best friend?
No.
I mean, I like to consider myself her best friend...... but Andrew is her best friend friend, if that makes any sense.
You ought to golf yourself.
You look a little stressed out.
I gotta go.
Bye.
Well, well, well.
This guy' s got quite a basket on him.
Really?
I didn' t notice that.
Do you really want the love of your life hanging around with a guy...... who looks as though he could satisfy a blue whale?
Well, it' s....
I' m doing okay myself, pal.
Maybe it' s the way his pants fit him.
What' s up?
- This is your young lady?
- That' s my Linda.
My, oh, my.
I was toying with the notion that you were gay...... because of the kitty- cat clothes, so forth.
What does she do?
She teaches poetry.
Poetry teacher.
I love poetry.
Oh, my, my, my.
It' s....
Yes, it' s a good picture of her.
Well, apparently Dr. Rydell has a history of unorthodox techniques.
He' s got a dozen lawsuits pending.
So it' s not just me.
This guy is nuts, isn' t he?
Or a genius.
But if you could prove that he' s nuts: audiotape, video, picture, whatever...... I' il arrange a hearing.
I gotta go.
I think he' s coming.
Hi, Nancy.
What are you doing in the ladies' room?
Sorry.
I just heard you guys got cleaner seats than us.
Not after I get through with them.
I don' t care for the way you' ve ironed my shirts, Dave.
Try it again.
- I' ve been very patient with you.
- Beware the fury of the patient man.
- I' m serious!
- Too serious.
Get undressed.
What did you say?
Take off your clothes.
I' ve got a stress- reduction technique to show you.
- It' il be good for you.
- Take off my clothes?
Do you want to see me naked, Buddy?
Are you a homophobe, Dave?
No, I' m a pulling- my- penis- out - in- front- of- you- a- phobe.
Let' s take a walk on the wild side.
- What' s up, baby?
- Why are we here?
I' m not a homophobe.
My lawyer' s gay.
His boyfriend is gay.
And are they all aware that you despise them?
Looking for company, baby?
No.
We' re not.
Thank you.
It' s worth 50 bucks...... if you get in the back seat with my friend here and have a little chat.
My pleasure, Mr. Eyebrows.
Oh, boy, here we go.
- Hello.
- Hey.
Good to see you.
- What' s your name, baby?
- Melvin.
His name is David.
Don' t dissemble.
I' m not dissembling.
That' s my Hebrew name.
I' m Galaxia.
That' s my German name.
Great.
Where are you from originally, Hebrew Melvin?
Brooklyn.
What part of Germany do you hail from?
I' m from a little Bavarian village called Lickin Zee Dickin.
Care to visit?
Actually, I like to spend most of my time...... in Girls Without Wieners- ville.
I' m more comfortable there.
He' s just not used to male intimacy.
Well, that' s okay, because I' m a lady.
Oops, no, I' m not.
Whoa!
There it is.
I feel like dancing.
Dancing.
Oh, my God.
What does this have to do with anger management?
- Oh, are you an angry boy?
- No.
Do you need some discipline?
No, thank you very --
Oh!
Hey!
Hey, watch that shit!
Gentleman!
Lentleman!
I' m not having sex with a she- male!
Relax!
Galaxia, you may get out of the car now.
Your services are no longer required.
You know what?
You guys are freaks.
Give me the tape recorder.
Come on.
Patient number 135, David Buznik...... has learned the difference between unhealthy anger and righteous anger.
Thus he has advanced to the second level of my program.
Great.
Can I go throw up now?
I' m a lady.
Oops, no, I' m not.
- Whoa, there it is.
- I feel like dancing.
Wasn' t that sick?
She looked like Olivia Newton- John...... if she was really ugly and had huge balls.
But Buddy didn' t order you to have sex.
I' m getting a call.
Please hang on.
- Hello?
- Is Buddy there?
No, he' s in the shower right now.
This is Becky, his assistant.
Just tell him his mom called from Boston.
She said she' s having some minor surgery.
It' s not serious, but she' il be at Boston County Hospital for the next two days.
Miracles of modern science.
I am stimulating my hair follicles...... and brushing my teeth at the same time.
It looks really good.
What' s the matter?
Your mom.
They took her to the hospital, Buddy.
What' s wrong with my mother?
She' s having surgery.
I' m sorry.
- Is it serious?
- When is surgery not serious?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You' re right.
Maybe I better get up to Boston...... see what' s going on up there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why don' t you just go up there.
Spend some quality time.
I' il stay here.
It' il be good for you guys.
Oh, God.
You' re all I got, Mom.
Please don' t leave me.
No more clam chowder.
Buddy...... it was a joke.
I' m sorry.
You don' t have to cry anymore.
- A joke?
- Yeah.
Oh, boy.
A joke.
A jo -- I....
I can' t believe that I fell for that one.
I really thought my mother was having surgery.
I' m going to get you back for that one.
Just so you know, she really is having surgery.
I thought you said you were joking.
No, the serious part was the joke.
She' s having surgery, but just minor surgery.
Maybe I better get up to Boston...... see what' s really going on up there.
Why don' t you --?
You just shoot up there.
I' il be here.
What?
- I can' t believe he' s making me go.
- How come you guys aren' t flying?
Because Dr. Cocoa Puff said legally I' m not allowed to get on a plane.
Meanwhile, I' ve got Head up my ass about that catalog.
I' ve got to get it done with nut- boy in Boston.
Why can' t Head write his own catalog?
Because I' ve got to earn that promotion.
You' ve been doing his job for years.
You should be his --
I' m sorry.
I know this is really stressing you out.
I' m sure that it' s going to be over before you know it.
Yeah, if I don' t get caught popping any Jelly Stingers.
Well, that' s going to be tough!
Oh, God.
There he is.
- That' s him?
- Yes.
What?
Okay, I' il hold that.
My --
Smoldering beneath the rituals Of hope for familiarity
Pregnant with the chance currents Of knowledge and love
- What?
- That' s my poem!
I wrote that.
I know.
That is your poem.
I love that poem.
I found it crumpled up behind the sports pages...... on the floor of David' s bedroom.
- Shades of early Emily Dickinson.
- Who was great on Police Woman.
Thank you.
And thank you for rescuing it from the floor.
I think I better get going.
I' il miss you, big guy, so take good care.
- How about a kiss?
- I' d love a kiss.
I think she' s talking to me.
I think I can handle it.
So why don' t you back up an inch or two.
Got it.
Thank you.
And, take care.
Have a great trip, you guys.
Oh, we will.
Bye.
What?
Some mindless nitwit is parked behind me.
Good.
Then we can' t go.
No, I can get out.
- Get in.
- I don' t know how you' il get out.
Try to wiggle out, you' re going to get a ding.
But you know everything.
What' s he doing?
Well, you' re batting a thousand...... in craziness.
Now we' re bumping into cars.
I' m just making a little room to back up.
If I had lost my temper...... would I have had the presence of mind...... to leave my card and my insurance information?
Whatever, Mr. Insane- Vein- Popping - A- Little- Too- Far- Out- Of- His- Head -...... While- Swinging- The- Bat Guy.
I think you' ve got room to back up.
Why haven' t you taken Linda off the market?
Think you can do better?
I' m going to ask her to marry me when I' m ready.
Nobody wants to settle down with a 35- year- old secretary.
Procrastination, Dave.
I' m not procrastinating.
I even think about how I' m going to pop the question.
Husky down jacket.
Husky Eskimo look.
What' s your plan, ask her at a Yankee game?
Actually, yes.
How did you know?
I said the corniest thing I could think of.
If you knew Linda, you' d know how uncorny it would be to her.
Putting up a "Marry me, please" on the scoreboard...... proclaiming my love for her in front of thousands of strangers.
As you seem to have noticed, I' m a little bit jumpy with public affection.
You seemed to be lovey- dovey back there.
Glad you think that' s funny.
I gotta work.
A five- hour trip to find out Mommy had a jelly bean...... removed from her nose.
I' m glad I missed work.
Can we eat now?
You could have her, you know.
I' m sure she' d love to hang out with a goofy secretary...... whose only talent is nostril wiggling.
- Girls love that.
- Dave...... you' ve got a lot more going for you than wiggly nostrils.
I want you to go over there and ask that woman out.
No, I got a girlfriend.
I' m not telling you to elope with her.
Just go over and flirt a little bit.
Flirting is cheating' s ugly cousin, Buddy.
I' m not a cheater.
Is it cheating if you' re passed around the cell block like a peace pipe?
Because that is what' s on the docket for you if you don' t go and ask her out.
Okay, Dave?
Oh, God.
That' s my boy.
Excuse me.
I was wondering if I could buy you a drink.
I see that you have a drink...... but I could get you another when you' re through with that one.
Bite me.
Nice meeting you.
Okay.
Can you guess why she rejected you?
She wanted to be like the 2000 other girls who said that to me growing up?
No.
Self- hypnotic negative imagery.
Confidence is the key to winning a young lady' s attention.
Now, listen to me very carefully.
- Approach Miss Thing again.
- No.
With confidence.
And if she says no this time...... I will admit that I am a failure as a therapist...... and release you from my program.
You' il release me from your program?
Just go over there and repeat the following...... verbatim:
I' m sorry I was so rude before...... but it' s difficult for me to express myself...... when I' m on the verge of exploding in my pants.
- Get out of here.
- Trust me, Dave.
If you are calm as well as witty, she will respond.
Witty went out the window with the pants explosion thing, thanks.
My offer stands.
So if I repeat that crazy shit...... you probably stole from a porno flick, you sick bastard...... and get rejected...... you' il release me from the program?
Exactly.
Here we go.
Go get them, Mr. Johnson.
I' m sorry I was so rude before...... but it' s difficult for me...... to express myself...
... when I am on the verge...... of exploding in my pants.
You are too cute.
Get the fuck out of here.
- I' m Kendra.
- I' m Dave.
Let me buy you a drink.
Can I get a cosmopolitan?
I couldn' t take it anymore...... so finally I just tell my boss:
"Hey, baldy, if I want crap out of you, I' il squeeze your head."
- I didn' t say that, but I should have.
- You are so funny.
Too bad you' re leaving town.
We could have fun together.
Unfortunately, I am leaving in the morning.
In fact, I think I gotta get back to my friend.
What' s the matter?
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What' s wrong?
My friend took off on me.
I can give you a ride.
I don' t even know where the guy lives.
We can hang out at my place until you get in touch with him.
I bet there' s like 50 Rydells in here.
I shouldn' t eat this.
I' m getting so fat.
What?
You' re not fat.
My clothes hide it, but I' m getting gooey right here.
I don' t see any goo.
You want to see goo, I' il show you my ass.
Well, I see it, and I didn' t five years ago.
I went out with this guy, and he wouldn' t sleep with me.
And I asked him why, and he said that when he saw me without my clothes...... that I look like a porker.
Anyways, you' re not a porker.
You' re the un- porker.
You' re Sizzlean.
- You' re so sweet, Dave.
- Well, you' re sweet, Kendra.
Thanks for having me here.
He said her name was Rose.
Rose.
Rose Rydell.
Rose Rydell.
Rose Rydell.
Rose Rydell!
I got it!
Kendra...... even though I' d love to see you take that bra off...... because it represents a team I' ve hated my entire life...... I think you gotta keep it on.
Why?
Because I got a girlfriend.
I' m not a child, Dave.
If you think I' m a porker, then just come right out and say it.
No.
I don' t think you' re a porker.
Then why when the idea of sleeping with me comes up...... do you all of a sudden have a "girlfriend"?
Because I do.
I do.
I have a girlfriend.
Said the liar to the beached whale!
You' re not a beached whale.
If anything, you could even gain a few pounds.
So now I' m too skinny for you?
No.
I didn' t mean that.
- Is this what you want, Dave?
- No.
If I put on a few pounds...... will you be able to stifle your vomit long enough to have sex with me?!
Holy shit.
Are you such a hot stud that you' il break me in two?!
You' re angry right now.
Wanna sing?
Do you know "I Feel Pretty"?
- Get out!
Get out!
- Stop!
Get out!
Get out!!
Porker!
Fatty!
No!!
How did it go, pal?
- Why' d you ditch me?
- What are you talking about?
You gave me the signal.
I didn' t give you the signal to leave.
I gave you the signal to say your gross pickup line actually worked.
Well, of course it did.
So did Little Davey need some anger management?
- That chick was killer.
- Serial killer.
She tried to chocolate me to death.
Anyways, I don' t cheat on Linda.
- Speaking of Linda, she called earlier.
- Oh, yeah?
She seemed a little bit bent out of shape.
- About what?
- Your being out with another woman.
- How would she know that?
- I told her.
- What else could I do?
- What else could you do?
You could' ve told her something else.
I was at the store.
I ate bad guacamole and I couldn' t stop shitting!
Any of those would have been fine!
Well, I' m sorry, Dave, but I don' t lie for my patients.
You want to leave your friend and run off and chase some hot babe...... you can' t expect me to cover for you.
I did what you told me to do, you sick, demented man.
What are you laughing at?
What' s so funny?
Kendra is an ex- patient of mine, an actress.
Pretty good one too.
I arranged for her to be in the bar and for you to pick her up.
You were messing with me?
Yeah.
You know, just a joke between friends...... like the one you pulled on me about my dying mother.
I told you I' d get you back for that.
All right.
So you really didn' t talk to Linda.
Of course I did.
That' s what made it so funny.
Where' s your phone?
She' s not home, Dave.
She went out with her pal Andrea.
She doesn' t know any Andreas.
You mean Andrew?
Yeah, that' s it.
Andrew, the testicle with legs.
"The testicle with legs." Great!!
Now wait a minute.
Calm down a bit.
Try some deep breathing.
Maybe just hum a little "I Feel Pretty."
No!!
How about you hum the "I' m a Crazy Asshole" song?
And take me home, you psychotic piece of wacko.
I never thought you' d take it like this.
So, what, we' re not going to talk at all?
Would you forgive me if I told you I called Linda last night...... after our little fracas and explained that it was my fault?
What did she say?
Well, she' s not mad at you anymore, but she let me have it pretty good.
You deserved it.
I did nothing wrong.
I know.
I know.
Friends?
- Take a little nap.
- I am tired.
Well, you had a rough night.
Stop with the cupcake!
Rise and shine, Sir Snoozola.
What' s going on?
Where are we?
Well, at a great deal of expense and effort...... we have managed to locate your grade school bête noire...... Arnie Shankman.
We do desire a confrontation with him, do we not?
What?
Do you mean the kid who bullied me in fifth grade?
Dave, I think it' s pivotal for you to confront your childhood nemesis.
Remember, for 22 more days, you are mine.
This is where Arnie Shankman lives?
You' re kidding me.
You' re going to make me confront a monk.
Great.
Are you ashamed that you never stood up to him?
No.
He was just a kid lashing out...... because his sister got sent to an insane asylum.
I' m surprised your research didn' t tell you that.
This doesn' t look like him.
Excuse me, Arnie Shankman?
Sorry about waking you up.
My name is Pana Kamanana...... but, yes, I was once known as Arnie Shankman.
Arnie....
Pana Kamanana...... Dave Buznik from elementary school.
David Buznik.
This is the last place I thought I' d find you, a monastery.
You could say I' ve gone through a rather dramatic transformation.
Could you excuse him for a second, Peanuts?
It' s Pana Manapia.
You want me to fight a monk?
He' s not even allowed to hurt a plant.
For Pete' s sake, this is the monk that twisted your tits!
Confront him or you' re going to prison!
All right.
All right.
All right.
Anyways, what I wanted to say to you was...... when we were kids, you kind of bullied me around a little bit...... and I never really did anything to deserve that kind of treatment.
Of course not.
I was a real cretin then.
I did a lot of horrible things as a kid.
I pushed you around.
I called you nasty names.
You pulled my gym shorts down in front of Sara Plowman.
That actually was pretty funny.
Jeez, I don' t think that it was.
Now, come, David.
Humor is the spice of life.
The look on your face was priceless.
"Oh!
Sara saw my pee- pee! "
So Pena likes the spicy humor.
Maybe he' d enjoy the knee- slapper you told me about the great Buddha.
What did you say about Buddha?
Dave said, "How does a guy who weighs over 600 pounds...... have the balls to teach people about self- discipline?"
Let' s not make fun of my God, here.
You know what else Dave finds particularly piquant?
Recalling your nut- job sister struggling with her underpants...... in a straitjacket.
You think that' s funny?
Dave used to con her into getting naked...... by saying that her clothes had ghosts in them.
That never happened.
Then he' d pull out his winkie and tell her...... it was a strawberry ice- cream cone.
Is that what you' ve come here to tell me?
Did you expose yourself...... to my sister?
- And don' t shove me again.
- It' s shower- room humiliation again.
He' s giving you a wet willie and making you chew on his jockstrap...... and fart blossom and all this.
Answer me, Buznik!
Did you get it on with my sister?
Over and over again.
And she moaned like a wildebeest.
Wildebeest.
Whoo!
Now, that felt good!
I wasn' t expecting that from a Buddhist.
- I' m a little pissed off right now.
- You all right?
You' re all right.
David!
David!
No, David!
Easy, boy!
Sorry.
Help me, brother.
- Help me.
- Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Okay, we' re even.
We' re even now.
I' m so sorry.
- I started it.
- I started it.
- It' s all right.
And I' m gonna finish it!
Now we' re even, butt- lick!
No!
Don' t!
Don' t!
Don' t!
"What' s that, Auntie Em?
It' s a twister! "
My nipples!
Pena!
Look!
Your sister' s back.
I got Casper in my clothes!
- Pretty good.
- Thanks, baby.
I' il kill you!
You want that rake?
You can' t get that rake from me!
Look, everybody!
Pana Banana' s got a heinie.
- He' s got a heinie!
- I give!
- I give!
- All right.
I' m sorry.
- Friends?
- You suck!
Shankman!
Wedgie!
Wedgie!
Wedgie!
- I' ve seen enough.
- Hold it right there.
This party' s by invitation only.
Pow!
Pow!
Pow!
Pow!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Hold it back there!
Come on, come on.
Start the car!
Go!
Go!
Come on, let' s go!
Now!
Now!
Now!
Now!
Oh, boy!
We were like Butch and Sundance!
Oh, my God!
I thought you were going to shoot somebody!
You really threw me some curves back there, kid.
I never expected it to go that way.
But you kicked some serious monk ass there, baby.
You' re damn right, baby!
- How did it feel?
- I feel good!
I feel incredible!
I feel bad about molesting his sister all those times, but it' s all right!
- You really molested a crazy girl?
Got you.
Congratulations, keed, you' ve reached level three.
I would never have done anything with that girl.
Don' t worry.
Dr. Rydell explained everything to me, and I get it.
Dr. Rydell brought up an interesting fact about me being a procrastinator...... and I was going to wait for a Yankee game to do this...... but....
I don' t know.
I....
It' s something I wanted to say to you...... and I' m having a hard time saying it for some reason.
But....
It' s just that monks, they talk shit...... but they can' t back it up.
That' s what was so hard to say to me?
You know, when I was on the phone with Buddy, he gave me some advice.
That' s great.
His advice is a little cuckoo...... but somehow it works.
Well, then I guess I' il just do what he suggested.
I don' t think that we should see each other for a while.
Buddy thinks that a trial separation will ultimately...... strengthen our relationship.
Now, Fury Fighters...... what keys do we need to possess before we can --?
Dave.
You' re late.
- Can I talk to you alone, please?
- Sure you can --
You told Linda we should have a trial separation?
- Yes.
- Yes?!
Yes!
Separating from Linda is a crucial part of our strategy.
My strategy is to keep my girlfriend.
All right.
Strictly as a friend.
Linda' s been thinking about leaving you for some time.
She loves you, but she recognizes you' re a neurotic mess.
You' re jealous...... self- Ioathing, resentful, insecure and a premature ejaculator.
She told you I was a premature ejaculator?
That part I was assuming.
I haven' t done that in, like, eight months.
Anyway, a trial separation will make you both gain a deeper appreciation...... for David Buznik.
After she dates a couple of losers, she' il be begging you to take her back.
So I' ve been thinking about it, Linda...... and a trial separation is exactly what we need.
And if you want to start seeing...... other penises -- People...... I want you to feel free.
You sound upset.
Are you all right?
I' m fine.
Just date anybody you' d like.
And don' t hold back, okay?
Because there' s a lot of nice guys out there and I' m cool with it.
I' il be strong.
So the guy asked me for change.
He cursed.
I whizzed on him.
- What else could I do, huh?
- You should' ve tossed a rock at him.
That' s your solution for everything.
The guy' s homeless, right?
Let him be.
Set your anger free.
Look at you, Lou.
You' ve really calmed down since working with Dr. B.
- We all have.
- Hey, fellas.
Could you bring it down a little bit?
We' re trying to have dinner.
The walls are really thin.
- This is a free country!
- What' s going on with you?!
- Are you crazy?!
- Go in!
Just go in.
Goosfraba!
Goosfraba!
Goosfraba.
Very good.
What are you guys doing here?
I need to see Dr. B. I' m in crisis.
He' s not here.
Why don' t you go look for him?
Davey, your girlfriend stopped by and she dropped these off for you.
Those are her keys to my apartment.
I think your girlfriend' s cheating on you.
- Why?
- I heard her on her cell phone...... talking to a guy...
-... making a date.
- I' m so sorry, Dave.
Andrew.
I' il kill that guy.
She ain' t cheating on me by the way.
We agreed to take a break.
She' s not taking a break from the old sausage, huh?
Sorry.
She' s meeting the Andrew at Mort' s on 86th Street now...... if you want to go watch.
No.
No, I can' t do that.
We' re here.
- Both of you showed up?
- You like Stacy better or something?
It' s just that I want to go on a fake date to get my girlfriend jealous...... so I really only needed one of you guys.
Well, now she' il be twice as jealous.
- So do you know the guy she' s with?
- I think I might.
Let me ask you something.
Because of your profession you probably have seen a lot of them.
Does size count at all, or is that just some weird thing guys think about?
This is where Gina and I always get into a heated debate.
I like them when they' re really big.
And I think it' s better when they' re enormous.
Good evening.
Table for three?
- May we take your coats?
- No.
We' re okay.
The girls are gonna take their coats off.
Booth?
Actually, could you give us a table overlooking that table right there?
- Sure.
Right this way.
- Thank you.
Oh, my God.
It' s Stacy and Gina.
Who?
Nobody.
I' m so hungry I could eat you, Dave.
Yummy.
Yummy.
- Let' s get wasted tonight.
- Definitely.
Have fun.
Lucky son of a bitch.
What?
I can' t believe this.
Excuse me.
Linda.
I' m a little embarrassed.
I didn' t know you were going to be here.
I guess not.
Are those your friends?
I' m supposed to date other people so I figured I' d give it a try.
Gina, can you stop sucking on Stacy' s finger for one second?
I want to introduce you to somebody.
- Stacy, Gina, this is Linda.
- Nice to meet you.
And I' d like you to meet my date.
Ladies, this is Buddy Rydell.
- Look, Dave, it' s Buddy.
- I see.
- You know Stacy and Gina?
- Yes, yes, I do.
We' re in Dave' s anger group.
Fury Fighters!
Well, gee whiz.
Here' s your Rémy, Linda.
This is a bit awkward.
I mean, group members...... are not supposed to get romantically involved.
- Yeah!
I agree with that.
- You know that.
I' d like to talk to you alone for a second.
There' s a rage control technique I' d like to go over with you right now.
Of course.
Excuse me --
What?
- Two of the usual, Duke.
- Coming right up, Dr. B.
You' re the biggest backstabbing piece of crap I ever met.
What are you saying?
I' m trying to give you a hand.
It' s my job.
Bullshit!
Your job is to steal my girlfriend?!
My job is trying to prevent Mr. Andrew...... from unleashing the Whopper with Cheese.
That' s right.
Since you' ve been out of the picture...... Andrew' s been burning up the wires night and day...... trying to rekindle those hotsie- totsie nights up at Brown U.
- How would you know?
- You think I only tapped your phone?
What was she saying?
The good news is, I already launched a preemptive strike.
Now the situation is contained.
You and I control the game.
How?
I will be uncharacteristically aggressively boring.
I keep talking about myself, acting arrogant and obnoxious.
When Linda sees what the dating world is really like...... then guess who comes out smelling like a white mushroom?
- You swear to me this will work?
- The ball' s already up in the air.
Incidentally, nice move bringing the girls.
Very strong.
Come on.
I' il see you at home in a half- hour, keed.
That' s 25 dollars, pal.
We don' t....
Where were you?
It' s 1: 00.
When you hear what happened, you' il bow down and worship me like a god.
- Better be good.
Give it to me.
- Okay.
After dinner, she insisted we go home.
So we hop on the bus --
The bus?
You took the bus?
What happened to your car?
I was way too smashed to drive.
I told her I didn' t want to waste money on a cab.
That did not go down well.
Okay.
I like that.
So we get to her house...... we have some kind of a weird argument...... about the number of syilables in a haiku.
Poetry garbage.
She said it was getting late, we kissed and I headed on home.
Now, you say you kissed?
It was nothing.
Little five- second kiss.
That' s all.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
You' re having this horrible evening.
- How do you end up kissing, again?
- I wish I knew, keed.
We were both pretty geezed up.
One second we' re fighting, and the next second we' re laughing...... and then just a quick 10- second kiss.
I thought that you said five seconds.
First it was a five- second one...... and then a little break because my beard gave her a tickle.
She' s cute.
And then a 10- second Frencher.
You had your crazy, corroded tongue in my girlfriend' s mouth?
Just a second.
Just one second, Dave.
Dr. B, let it bip.
Well, hello.
I shouldn' t really talk right now.
Well, I suppose you' re right.
It' s got to be done.
Who was that?
Linda?
I' ve got some good news for you and some potentially upsetting news.
First, the good news.
I' m going to sign your papers.
You' re a free man.
Let me hear the potentially upsetting news.
Linda and I have fallen for one another.
Pretty hard too.
I didn' t intend for this to happen.
It was no one' s fault, I guess.
It was just --
Wait a minute.
I figured this out.
You' re messing with me.
I wish I were, Dave.
However, I did insist that we not go forward without your blessing...... because we' re best friends.
So, what do you say, Dave?
Is it all right if I date your ex?
Welcome back, Mr. Buznik.
I am appalled by your assault on Dr. Rydell.
Obviously, anger management has been a complete failure for you.
I' m setting a trial date for 3 weeks from today for attempted murder.
As for Dr. Rydell' s safety, I' m issuing a restraining order.
Which means that at no time can you come within 500 feet of him...... or his lovely new girlfriend, Linda.
Court is adjourned.
Coming, Peaches.
Are you kidding me?
Numb- nuts, where' s the catalog for my Fat Cat clothing line?
I said I' d have it by 3.
- Okay.
- Get in gear.
I' m so sorry I' m late.
I hope you have it.
My presentation' s in two hours.
What' s this?
Your fat- shit cat' s been sitting there all day.
Don' t worry about him.
Here you go.
I think you' re gonna like it.
It' s good stuff.
That' s a good picture, I think.
What the hell is this?!
You keep telling everybody you created the Husky Cat line.
I thought you' d want your picture in there.
No?
Can I get two couches in my office?
If friends come over, I want them to feel comfortable.
What office?
Frank was nice enough to give me some creative executive position.
- You gave him the job that I wanted?
- He earned it.
Why can' t you be happy for me?
Linda' s gonna be.
Know something?
I' m sick of you hanging out with Linda.
She dumped you 15 years ago.
Get over it.
I wouldn' t worry about me.
It' s your pal Buddy who' s taking her to the Yankee game tonight.
Yankee game.
Did he steal my proposal idea?
Buznik, your behavior is unacceptable.
Unacceptable?
I' ve been getting your coffee and doing your work for five years now.
When a good position actually opens up...... you give it to the biggest dick in the world?
I don' t know about the world, but it' s definitely the biggest one in the room.
Now, when I started here...... I was promised advancement opportunities.
And breaking that promise, to me, is unacceptable.
You see?
I golf also.
You should bring me sometime.
So when I get out of jail, sometime in the next two to five years...... I expect you to give me the position that Andrew just resigned from.
- Okay.
- Great.
Have fun looking like Colonel Klink.
By the way, his name is not Fat- shit Cat, it' s Meatball...... and he' s eating your crab cakes right now.
- You starting to get excited?
I' m out of my mind.
This is going to be some night.
Come on.
Come on.
- Dr. B, how' s it going?
- Very well, thank you.
Always a thrill.
Right this way.
Where the hell' s a spot?
Where' s a spot?
Whoa!
Watch it, man!
Your attention, please.
Your attention, please.
Before tonight' s National Anthem...... Metropolitan Opera star Robert Merrill...... will present a special moment for two special people.
I love when they do this.
- Good.
- Ladies and gentlemen, Robert Merrill.
Linda?!
Linda!
What the hell do you think you' re doing?
Wait, don' t I know you?
- Come on.
- Where' s your German accent?
You have me confused with somebody --
I wanna get on the field.
I' m a fan of Mr. Merrill' s.
- There' s no fans allowed on that field.
- Galaxia.
It' s Gary.
Someone else will marry my woman if you don' t let me go.
- Hebrew Melvin' s in love.
- Very much.
I can' t stop love.
- Go.
- Thank you.
Don' t think I don' t owe you a couple smacks by the way.
Good evening.
Tonight, romance comes to Yankee Stadium.
Oh, my God, it' s Dave.
What the heck are you doing here?
- I wanna borrow this for a second.
- That' s my mike!
Linda?
Where are you?
Don' t move.
Linda?
Are you out there, honey?
Linda, I' m not mad at you.
Oh, shit.
I know that crazy man brought you here.
Davey' s going crazy!
I' ve done crazier stuff than that to win back a chick.
Once I ran naked through a subway station.
How was that supposed to work?
I guess I never really thought it through.
I gotta tell you something personal!
This kid lost his marbles.
I' m over here!
Linda, think about what you' re doing to us.
Sweet tackle.
Wow!
Dave just got leveled!
- Nobody messes with my microphone.
- I' m sorry.
Bob?
- Everything all right, Buddy?
- Oh, yeah.
I' ve never seen you so excited.
It' s not every day a man gets to propose marriage...... to the woman he loves.
Now, here' s what I want you to write on the scoreboard.
Linda!
Linda, I' ve loved you since the day I met you!
I won' t let you do this to us!
Don' t marry him!
Don' t marry him!
Wait!
Let this man finish what he came here to say.
Let the man back in.
- Who was that guy?
- I think it' s Regis Philbin.
Thank you, Mayor Giuliani.
You' re the man, by the way.
My arm' s starting to ice over.
Chill, Rocket.
Goosfraba.
Goosfraba.
Goosfraba.
I can understand why you wanted to see other people.
I really can.
Buddy Rydell is a psycho!
But he was right about one thing.
I was an angry guy.
Mainly angry at myself...... for letting people treat me like crap all the time.
But I don' t want to be that angry guy anymore.
I wanna change.
If you give me a chance...... I can show you that I got the guts to stand up for what I believe in.
And I believe in us, Linda.
I love you with all my heart, and I know you love me back.
I should be your husband...... not that weirdo.
I want to have a family with you.
I want to have kids with you.
That' s all I wish on them.
Please marry me, Linda.
Before I make my decision, you have to do something for me.
You have to kiss me in front of all these people!
You can do it, David!
Give her a five- second Frencher!
Kiss her, David.
Kiss her, David.
Kiss her, David!
Kiss her, David.
Go Yankees!
Dave' s a dirty boy.
That wasn' t so bad, was it?
I can' t believe you actually started to fall for that crazy man.
Buddy' s not such a bad guy.
Congratulations!
You just graduated from anger management!
I' m glad your car died.
The train' s romantic.
Don' t change the subject.
You' re telling me the past two weeks of my life was just therapy?
Well....
Yeah.
I met with Buddy after reading his book...... and I told him about some of the things going on in your life...... and how upset it was making you and how nuts it was making me.
He said that he thought he could help, but it would be tough.
So how much of this thing was a setup?
Well, the guy in your seat on the plane, the flight attendant, the judge...... they' re all friends of Buddy' s.
What about the air marshal who tasered me?
Was he in on it?
No, he was just having a bad day.
Son of a bitch.
Skipper, how you doing?
Buddy Rydell, you' re a great man.
I was just doing my job.
I never doubted you for a minute.
Except when Galaxia had ahold of you.
Did you just call that guy Buddy Rydell?
A guy named Buddy Rydell left this card...... on what' s left of my Lexus!
Oh, yeah.
For insurance purposes.
Your insurance was canceled!
Grenada!
Don' t point that gun at Buddy.
I' m the one who smashed your car up.
- Dave?!
- No!
I' m sick of guys like this.
You wanna mess with my friends, shoot me first.
- Don' t!
- Are you crazy?
Settle down.
Tough guy' s going to learn a lesson.
I' m not afraid.
Dr. Rydell taught me not to be afraid of anybody.
Can I ask you a question, though?
Got you!
Dr. B, Davey just pulled a joke on us!
And how does that make you feel, Lou?
Chuck.
We were just doing a joke.
That' s my friend.
Are you okay?
You' re lucky, you know.
I rarely allow anyone into my flat.
I know, I know, I know.
Humble digs.
Not exactly what you' d call a "panty peeler."
Do you know what I mean?
But it suits me just fine.
To be honest, I rarely spend a night in my own bed anyway.
You see, here' s my theory:
For most women, if a guy' s a good provider and generally a nice chap, six- pack abs really aren' t a deal- breaker.
On the flip side, however, even though the PC boyfriend sat next to you with his arm slung around your shoulder will deny it...
And he will deny it.
For us boys, it' s all about F. B. B.
Face.
Boobs.
Bum.
I' m just being honest.
It' s been said that clothes speak the international language.
And I have to admit, I' m a bit of a fashion whore.
Unfortunately, today I' ve got work, and I have to tone it down a little bit, but that' s all right.
Gucci.
End- of- summer sale.
Very understated.
And I can easily spice it up with...
What?
No, no.
I know what you are thinking.
If you ooze masculinity, like some of us do, you have no reason to fear pink.
Smashing.
My rule:
Nothing above the neck, though I do like a little splash on Big Ben.
You never know where the day may take you.
Almost forgot.
The attempt to attract attention to oneself. "
Who?
Me?
Oh, blimey.
I' m so rude.
I haven' t introduced myself.
- I' m...
- Alfie?
There you go.
Alfie.
Are you the little elf that left these mocha bonbons on my doorstep?
No, no, no.
You must have a secret admirer, Mrs Schnitman.
You are such a doll, Alfie.
But I' m supposed to be on a diet.
Oh, on a diet?
- A diet.
- You?
- Yeah.
- Now, I don' t mean to be forward, Lu, but you should know by now that a full- figured girl like yourself
- is every guy' s secret fantasy.
- Stop it.
So she' s a tub of lard.
The ship' s already sailed, so why not make her feel good about herself, right?
- Oh, Lu?
- Yes, angel?
I' m working the night spot, and my apartment is a horror show, so I' m sorry if I keep you up
- with the dust- busting at 2 a. m.
- Oh, don' t you worry.
- I' il give it a quick straighten.
- Oh, no, no, you don' t need to that.
Nonsense.
I like doing things for you, Alfie.
I' m a blessed man having you in my life.
Thank you.
Keys are in the usual spot.
Now, back home, you' re always hearing tales about some bloke migrating to the States and winding up with buckets of money.
So not long ago, I packed up my bucket and headed west.
Now, I must admit, I had a second motive.
I' d always been told that the most beautiful women in the world...... resided in Manhattan.
And when it comes to shagging birds, it' s all about one thing:
Location, location, location.
God, I love this city.
All right, girls.
Just look around.
I mean, every one of them, unique, special,
like snowflakes.
Calendar word meaning "abundance," of gorgeousness and diversity, well, how could a man ever choose to settle down with just one?
I myself subscribe more to the European philosophy of life.
Well, actually, that' s about it.
Wine and women.
Although, women and women is always a fun option.
So...... to live life to the fullest,
I require only enough to cover my modest expenses.
I' ve no desire to be the richest stiff in the cemetery.
I think this might just be my favourite position.
I know it was President Kennedy' s.
He was such a great leader.
Of course, JFK used the old bad- back excuse, but if you ask me, he knew it gave you maximum pleasure with minimum exertion.
What is it about the back of a limo?
Obligatory cuddling.
Thousand one, thousand two...
Cripes.
Hey, I' ve gotta get cracking.
I' ve got a 10: 00 pickup.
You better hurry up.
You don' t want to keep her waiting.
Quite the number, isn' t she?
Yet, she tells me her old man hasn' t shagged her in six months.
Six months.
I mean, thank God there are gentlemen like me around to pick up the slack.
Just look at her.
Legs like a racehorse.
Perfect yoga bum.
I give her my highest grade:
A- minus.
Where did we tell the old man we were going tonight?
- A movie.
- Treasure, please, no, no, no.
Stop messing about.
You' il ruin my presets.
- Sorry.
- What movie?
I don' t know.
What' s the difference?
The difference is, the more detail you give, the less interested he' il be.
It wouldn' t matter what I said.
It would never occur to Phil that another man
- would ever look twice at me.
- Dor, darling, you fishing for a compliment?
No.
You should know by now they only come from me when least expected.
Now, come and have a mint so Phil doesn' t smell the Alfie on your breath.
I don' t care if he does.
It' s married women.
Dorie doesn' t know it yet, but you won' t be seeing much more of her.
I' ve got that all- too- familiar feeling.
Sooner or later, she' il be wanting a little bit more than I' m able to give.
Wouldn' t it be great if I was going home with you tonight instead of Phil the Pill?
Yeah.
It' s definitely time to stage a disappearing act.
So next Tuesday, same time, same place?
I' m sorry, love, it' s Fashion Week.
I' m booked double shifts.
- I' il call you the instant things let up.
- Okay.
In the meantime, I left you a little souvenir to remember me by.
Oh, Dor?
Your derrière looks really rather ravishing from this vantage point.
See?
A compliment when least expected.
What can I say?
Happy as a pup with two tails.
And I think I' ve done old Phil a bit of a favour too.
Of course, he' d be the last to see it.
Never expect any thanks in this life.
You know what I mean?
So Tuesday...... 10: 03 p. m.
Do I drag myself home to a cold flat, empty fridge, or nip across town for a hot bath, warm body, breakfast in bed?
Decisions, decisions...
Yeah, I think I' il pay a visit to my semi- regular, quasi, sort of girlfriend.
My sweet Julie.
Let me guess.
Yeah.
She had me going up and down for hours.
That supposed to be funny?
Not.
Hey!
I' m not kidding, Alfie!
I hate you sometimes.
You have a very ostentatious way of showing it.
Yeah, I sure do.
No, darling.
Can we hit pause?
I just need a second to unwind.
Oh, I nicked half a bottle of Stoli from the limo.
How do you want yours, on the rocks?
I just want my usual, Alfie.
Straight up.
No, I' m so totally knackered.
I' il make it up to you in the morning.
Cross my heart.
But tonight, all I' m good for is a bite to eat, hot bath and a nice long sleep.
You know, this isn' t a Holiday Inn, Alfie.
What' s that again?
Where were you tonight?
Really?
You' ve got to open a restaurant.
That' s seriously delicious.
Thanks, Alfie.
It' s just chilli.
Hey.
A little eye contact, please.
We have something here, or am I just a glorified booty call?
Hey.
Hey.
She wants me to commit.
Become "domestified."
Now, it doesn' t do to become dependent on anybody in this life.
Change your nature, you' re a dead man.
Chilli, please.
Don' t get me wrong.
She' s adorable.
Cute?
Absolutely.
But is it ever enough?
I told you how we men are.
We want showstoppers.
And the problem is, Julie hasn' t got enough of the superficial things that really matter.
- I don' t deserve you.
- Yeah, that' s probably true.
Too bad I love you.
Thanks, babe.
- Alfie, Alfie...
- What?
You' re giving me the "Thanks, babe."
You' re giving me the "Thanks, baby."
- Calm down.
- Don' t tell me to calm down!
- I know how you feel!
- Wait a minute.
- You' re gonna wake up...
- Max.
Hey, little man.
Did we wake you up?
Yes.
Now, lads, learn from my mistake.
Never get involved with a single mum.
See, they come with accessories, some of which can be...... unfortunately, irresistible.
Sights like that make you realize we all have an expiration date.
And women do have a shorter shelf life than men, don' t they?
I think that' s what Julie was banging on about yesterday.
Elegant Limousine and Chauffeur.
This is where I make my reasonably honest living.
Standards of elegance has taken quite a pounding, wouldn' t you say?
I know.
Believe me, it' s merely a stepping stone.
Currently parked on one of those stepping stones is my best mate and future business partner, Marlon.
Black.
Like Lonette' s skin...... which I will never again touch.
I' m afraid you' re not meeting my man on top form.
See, Marlon' s got a problem.
It' s called Lonette.
And very recently, it dumped him.
Oh, dear.
Three a. m.
Begging, at her front door.
- Level of inebriation?
- Vomiting.
Right.
So let me get this straight.
In the morning, begging and vomiting?
And what, she wasn' t charmed by that?
Alfie?
Why is there no Stoli in car number two?
I' ve no idea.
I gotta watch this guy like a hawk.
That little chap' s name is Wing.
My boss and owner of this tragic enterprise.
- Wipe that car good.
- Owner, that is, till me and Marlon swing a loan and buy it out from underneath his scrawny...
Hello.
You miss bird shit.
Wing.
He' s barking mad.
Check out the way he talks to the little woman.
She' s given him her best years, cooked his chop suey, helped with the business, and I bet at one time he couldn' t wait to rip off her kimono.
And now look at him.
And I' m supposed to respect the institution of marriage?
That' s a great figure, man.
We swing that loan, cash your IRA, I hock my Vespa...
We' re gonna take Wing by surprise with an offer like this.
I could' ve predicted this.
See, Marlon and Lonette have reached that critical 18- month "Where are we going, what are we doing, what' s happening here?" crisis point that rears its ugly head in every relationship.
Lonette wanted ring, home, baby.
Marlon wanted another 18 months to make sure nothing better was coming his way.
I fucked up egregiously.
By the time he realized he' d made a mistake and he wanted her back...... it was too late.
- Hey, stranger.
Hey.
Carol.
- Carol.
Hi, Carol.
- Hi.
You look wonderful.
So, Carol, well, it' s nice to see you again.
You be well.
What' s up with that?
Put it this way, the show closed after one performance only.
- Do I even wanna know why?
- No.
Come on, it would be less than discreet to tell you why.
Hair on the arms.
Seriously.
Long, thick...
What are you talking about?
You don' t have hair on your arms?
- You' re looking very lovely tonight.
- Thank you.
Dude, the iron door has slammed shut, man.
Classic, isn' t it?
Now that he can' t have her, he thinks he can' t live without her.
Some people are funny.
Maybe...
Maybe it was time to stoke the home fires.
Anybody in the mood for a little Alfie, straight up?
Oh, this isn' t a good time, Alfie.
Got a lot on my mind.
Oh, God.
Yeah, I really hate when that happens.
Open up, baby.
You look seriously beautiful.
- Not tonight, Alfred.
- What' s the matter?
Tell me.
Well, I guess I' m...
I' m just seeing red.
I mean, the poor guy, he' s dying.
You' ve tortured him long enough.
Alfie, he should' ve thought about all that before he was screwing around with that ex- girlfriend of his.
Those fake- ass, $5 titties.
- Those are fake?
- Hello?
Wow, I' m devastated.
They' ve got, like...
Alfie, you' re supposed to be consoling my devastation, remember?
I am.
Look, he came back, didn' t he?
Begging, crawling on his knees, vomiting...
I don' t care.
I' m sorry, I' m not that easy.
I don' t forgive and I definitely do not forget.
- Is okay if I leave now, miss?
- Oh, sí, Felix.
And hit the lights on your way out, por favor.
I better go.
It' s really coming down out there.
Yeah.
And I' m wearing suede.
You' re telling the truth.
That' s brilliant.
Okay.
I got one.
I never swam in the Pacific Ocean.
- Me neither.
- Oh, shit.
Okay.
Okay.
I' ve never seen a James Bond movie.
You' re joking.
Not even a Sean Connery?
You serious?
Wow, I don' t know if that' s magic or tragic.
Okay.
Five ball.
- I' ve never made my own bed.
- Oh, bullshit.
No, I repeat, I' ve never made my own bed.
Well, what kind of mama you got?
That' s a good question.
Let' s see.
All right.
- All right.
I' ve never had sex...
I' ve never had sex with two people in one night.
Six- five, your favour.
Gotcha.
So, Alfie, what' s the most you' ve had in one night?
We' ve stopped playing the game, haven' t we?
Am I wrong, or is there a little innocent flirting going on here?
Driftin 'on a memory
Ain' t no place I' d rather be Than with you
Loving you
See, if I had that kind of talent...
And a song
- Go on, finish your sentence.
- If I had that kind of talent, and I looked like you...
And a song... I would be strutting my stuff - Oh, yeah?
On a stage.
Trust me, what happens next was the furthest thing from my mind when I dropped by tonight.
But then I thought to myself,
"You know what?
I owe it to both of them, as a friend, right?
To do whatever I can to help. "
I find that, lately, even lying to myself comes easily.
The next morning, and I can' t get last night out of my mind.
Try desperately to focus on something else, anything else.
Anything to get my mind off my best friend' s incredibly hot, best- ass- I' ve- ever- seen- in- my- life girlfriend.
Alfie.
Alfie.
- Alfie!
- Shall I pretend I can' t hear him?
Dude.
- Hey!
- Too late.
Too late.
- Dude, would you slow down?
- Hey, Marly, what' s up?
"Marly"?
Hey, listen, I gotta talk to you.
You ain' t going nowhere till you tell me what went down last night.
- Down last night?
- Dude, don' t mess with me.
What happened with Lonette?
Have you ever heard the word "knock"?
- What went down?
- What?
Nothing happened.
- We had a few shots.
- Missus give me silent treatment.
Little she know, not hearing constant "blah, blah, blah" is gift from heaven.
You keep it up.
Keep it up, mate, it' il work.
Alfie, what happened?
Oh, fuck a duck, man.
Look, I...
- I drank a lot last night.
- Drunk.
Well, I...
I really...
I don' t remember.
- Dude, you did something to her.
- No.
Oh, yeah, you did.
Because she shows up at my house, at 4 in the morning, saying that she wanted me back.
She even said that if I needed more time, that she understood completely.
How fucking crazy.
Chalk one up for the blokes.
Thanks to me, Marlon won the game.
Which means he' s off scot- free, and so am I.
This is a bloody miracle.
That' s fantastic.
Fantastic.
- Come on, what did you say to her?
- Look, look.
- It' s all good.
- Come on, what did you say?
I asked her to marry me.
You know you' re my best man, right?
Moral of the story:
No good deed goes unpunished.
New word for the day?
"Resilience:
The ability to readily recover after disappointment or loss. "
Capacity to spring back.
Understand, it' s not about replacing Julie.
I just wanna get back to the simple life:
Women who mean nothing to me.
So I' ve struck up a friendship with a nightclub hostess called Uta.
Hello, Uta.
Now, as a heat- seeking bachelor,
I have to live by some very simple rules.
Alfie Elkins' credo or philosophy, which is probably best summed up by the only advice my father ever gave me.
He said, "Son, whenever you meet a beautiful woman...... just remember, somewhere there' s a bloke who' s sick of shagging her."
- Can I help you, man?
- G and T, please.
Explain to me what everyone sees in that Eurotrash?
I think it' s incredibly unfair that it' s acceptable for men to be sexually experimental, then with a woman, if she wants to try something...
A kiss or a threesome.
You know, that they' d be judged.
I wouldn' t judge them.
And I think if you two were to kiss, I would...
I would just...
I would just see it as a thing of beauty.
Although I' m living every guy' s Rat Pack fantasy, something feels a bit off.
And throwing myself back into the old lifestyle isn' t going quite as smoothly as I' d hoped.
Sorry.
I' m sorry.
You carry on without me.
Oh, my loves, I...
I don' t know what happened.
This is so unlike me.
Yeah, you...
You two just...
I used to think there was nothing worse than death.
Then, from out of nowhere...... the unthinkable.
Now I really don' t get what everyone sees in you.
It just keeps on happening and happening.
Or more accurately, not happening and not happening.
This never happens, Uta.
Honestly, never.
Honestly.
Not the word around town...... peewee.
Mr Elkins?
Miranda Kulp.
Miranda.
The penis doctor is a he with a little bit of she thrown in.
So I understand you' re experiencing some erectile dysfunction.
I am experiencing a little...
A little...
A little bit of...
What you just said.
Not to worry.
That' s my area of expertise.
So have you been under any unusual emotional stress lately, Mr Elkins?
Me?
No, never.
Well, unless you count that recent chat I had with Julie.
I can' t see you anymore, Alfie.
- Why?
You angry?
- No, I' m really not angry.
Just, you know, we want different things.
And I can' t have you traipsing in and out of Max' s life.
You' ve changed your hair, haven' t you?
You have, haven' t you?
No, you have.
You' ve changed your hairdo.
You cut it?
It looks gorgeous.
- Thanks.
- How come...?
How come you never had it like that when we were together?
I really gotta go.
Well, I guess...... you need these back.
Thank you.
Alfie?
You gonna be okay?
Yeah.
No worries.
I' m always okay.
Alrighty, let' s take a gander at that penis of yours.
I see.
Well.
- It seems we have lift- off.
- It seems we do.
Wunderschön.
What a relief.
Well, I mean, if he can give me a stiffy, I should have no problem keeping it up for the target demographic, shouldn' t I?
Well, there doesn' t appear to be anything physiologically wrong, so, in short, we can be fairly certain your problem
- was simply stress- related.
- Translation:
Julie- related.
Like I always say, if they don' t get you one way, they' il get you another.
However,
- I did feel something a little kooky.
- Kooky?
There is nothing to get upset about, Mr Elkins.
I thought I felt a lump...... on your penis.
But with any luck, it will be nothing.
The words "lump" and "penis" in the same sentence.
There' s something you don' t hear every day.
And so young Alfred got an early Yuletide gift.
A penis biopsy.
I get my test results in three days...
Well, five.
Five counting the weekend.
Oh, Lord.
Oh, Lord.
How am I gonna stop myself going completely bonkers?
I' il be fine.
I' il be fine.
I' m a young man.
Shift focus, Alfie.
Shift...
Let' s go, kids.
Let' s go.
Move along, children.
Look straight ahead.
Come on.
Do not look at the man.
Look straight ahead.
In the meantime, perhaps I' m safer hobbling on home.
Alfie, dear, what' s wrong?
You look like death warmed over.
No, I' ve just...
I' ve got a bit of a football injury, that' s all,
Mrs Schnitman...
Hello, Mrs Liberman.
You two look lovely.
Where you going?
- Shopping.
You need anything?
- I' m fine.
Hello.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Ladies, this is my friend Lonette.
She' s lovely.
Good for you, dating an African- American.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey, girl.
I missed you.
Don' t mind us.
We' re not here.
You kids keep talking.
- Very nice to meet you.
- See you, Mrs Liberman.
Shop till you drop, girls.
So how have you been?
I' m pregnant.
It seems to me the problems you worry yourself sick about never seem to materialize.
It' s the ones that catch you unexpectedly on a Wednesday afternoon that knock you sideways.
I offered to face the music with her...... but she wanted to go it alone.
We both knew that if the baby was born with any white- boy features it would mean the end of Lonette and Marlon.
Not to mention your host for this evening.
But standing in the cold, I find myself having regrets.
Thinking thoughts like,
"Here' s another kid you' il never get a chance to know.
Your own. "
Didn' t take long.
Bloody hell, you' re freezing.
How do you feel?
Empty.
That night in the bar, I thought I was getting something for nothing.
Doesn' t seem to have worked out that way, does it?
Oh, man.
If everything turns out okay, maybe this little brush with mortality is a sign.
I should think about making...
Making some changes.
Possibly.
- Next week.
- Excuse me.
Did I just...?
Did you just look at me?
Did I just notice you turn away?
Look, if you know the results to my tests, and they' re telling you...
- Mr Elkins.
- Please.
Please.
Mr Elkins, for the millionth time, sit down.
Mr Belson, I have a cancellation on Tuesday at 11: 30.
I' m gonna be fine.
- I just feel it.
- Thank you.
Goodbye.
I' il just be a minute.
Or ten.
- It' s all right.
Take your time.
- I don' t have a choice.
I used to pee.
Now I trickle.
- I' m Joe.
What' s your name?
- Alfie.
So how you doing, Alfie?
- Hanging in.
You?
- Shitty.
Yeah, me too.
Me too.
- I like the bolo tie.
- Oh, thanks.
I have a collection.
You know, when you' re old, you learn to be patient.
Yeah.
Used to be I never had time for nothing.
Go, go, go.
- I know that feeling.
- Yeah.
My wife was always hawking me to take a little vacation.
Hawaii.
Reno.
I always said, "Next year, Evie, next year.
I got too much on my platter. "
I always thought I' d have more time.
Then one Sunday night, she takes the pot roast out of the oven.
Yells, "Soup' s on," and slumps to the kitchen floor.
Just like that.
Dead as disco.
Jesus, I' m sorry.
I tried picking up the pieces.
Even went to Waikiki alone on the 8- day cruise package she was always yakking about.
Couldn' t get Evie out of my mind.
There' s two things I learned in life, kid:
You find someone to love, and live every day as though it were your last.
She' s all yours, Alfie.
Enjoy.
You all right, son?
Yeah.
I hope so.
Look, if you ever get bored or feel like schmoozing...... give me a holler.
- You' il never call.
- Maybe I will.
All right, good.
We' il go to a bar together, hit on some chicks.
Damn right.
Thanks, Joe.
Hey.
I' m sorry about Evie.
We...... weren' t all that fond of each other...... but we were very close.
- If you know what I mean.
- I think I do.
I' ve been thinking a lot lately about God and death.
And how, if what they taught me in Bible class is true,
I' m really in for it.
I' m gonna live!
I' m gonna live!
I ruined my Prada lace- ups and I don' t care.
Don' t think I' ve forgotten my oath to completely change my life, because I haven' t.
Yep.
Health is now priority number one.
Business plan moves onto the fast track.
- If you say so...
- Tonight' s preview at St. Ambrose...
No, I definitely don' t want to talk.
Okay, hold on, what else have I got?
Okay, yeah.
All right, if we must, we must, but...
New slate.
New beginning.
- What' s your name, driver?
- Alfie, sir.
Wait here, Alfie.
Do you know how long you' re gonna be, roughly?
- You got someplace to go?
- No, I was just gonna nip off
- and get a cup of tea.
- Look, why don' t you just stay put.
A definite yea, I think.
Really.
Stunning.
Wouldn' t you say so, sir?
I' m sorry, didn' t I ask you to wait by the car?
Definite yea?
I think.
With one minor...
- May I?
- You may.
Adjustment.
Bullfighter.
Another lifetime.
Don' t ask.
Fifty, if she' s a day.
But don' t they say 50 is the new 40, and is she not living proof?
I mean, have a look.
Beautifully preserved.
And cleavage like the Holland Tunnel.
- Better?
- Much.
You are so right to trust Chanel.
A pair of hot- pink stilettos, and you' re good to go.
- Well, aren' t you Mr Full- Service?
- We try.
- He' s getting a little pissy, isn' t he?
- Oh, it' s fine.
It' s good for him.
- Is your husband a lot older than you?
- He' s not my husband.
He' s wearing a wedding ring.
Well, I never said he wasn' t somebody else' s husband.
- Grab the stuff from the trunk?
- You got it.
Cheers.
Ma' am, if you require my services in the future.
Happy Christmas, sir.
Ma' am.
Now that, my friends, is a real woman.
Smart and sexy and...
You noticed the little flirt going on between us, huh?
Makes me think, if a woman like that, of that calibre should take notice of a bloke like me, then, perhaps...
Perhaps I' m selling myself a bit short.
In a flash,
I have my New Year' s resolution.
Aim higher.
Catastrophic.
Doomed.
Desolate.
Cataclysmic.
Bought him a word- of- the- day calendar for Christmas.
Big mistake.
Holiday season, busiest time of the year.
I try to run a business.
- What' s the problem, Mr Wing?
- Your soul brother.
He quit.
In the letter Marlon left me, he called me his best friend...... but apologized for bailing on our business scheme.
He said his whole thing now was to make Lonette happy.
They decided, on the spur of the moment, to move upstate, and I had a standing invite to drop by any time.
Somehow Lonette convinced Marlon it would be too painful to say our goodbyes in person.
And to make matters worse, it all dovetails into the second loneliest night of the year:
Christmas Eve.
A night that brings on all those familiar festive feelings of hopelessness, anguish, despair.
Not a great time to be flying solo.
That' s why I' m of the belief couples should never split up between Thanksgiving and January 2nd.
Always have a relationship to see you through the holidays.
Always.
The downside, of course, being gifts.
Personally, I' ve always suspected that everyone else is having a far merrier Christmas than I am.
Not that I' ve ever actually had a Christmas.
That' s a whole other Dickens story.
Taxi.
Taxi.
Excuse me.
I' m sorry, mate, it' s against the law for me to carry any more than...
Thank the Lord.
A Christmas miracle.
All right, hop in.
Thanks for saving us.
I was freezing my little tush off.
No worries.
You know, it' s pretty full back there.
- Why don' t you...
- Good idea.
Why don' t I?
Hey, watch the champagne.
All in.
- They don' t get out much.
- You wanna watch out, you guys.
You' il end up with a lump of coal in your stocking.
You' re English.
I love English.
- What' s your name?
- Alfie.
You wanna abuse a little substance, Alfie?
No, thanks.
I' m trying to quit.
All right.
One hit.
Merry Christmastime
There' s an expression the Yanks use, "Go with the flow."
So, yeah, I got a dose of the holiday blues.
But when a girl of this mind- blowing calibre invites you to a party, it' s time to get going and start flowing.
Maybe it' s the late hour.
Maybe it' s the heavily spiked eggnog.
Maybe it was simply a mutual desperate desire to have ourselves a merry little Christmas.
Whatever the reason, hooking up has never gone more swimmingly, and I find myself saying something highly out of character:
I' m renovating my apartment on the Upper West Side.
But, say, you could...... crash at my sublet, if you want.
hi.
- how' d it go?
Got a '63 Thunderbird I would' ve sold in a day a year ago.
Now they just wanna look at the pictures.
You smell nice.
how was your day?
We had a big breakthrough in the Bulgari case.
Really?
A really good one.
The left heel was worn way down.
I know.
We found a hair.
It' s at the Iab.
So hopefully by noon tomorrow we' il find out his DNA...... what kind of conditioner he uses, if he streaks his hair...... if he has dandruff, everything.
Isn' t that amazing?
That is amazing.
Oh, you' re just being modest.
Are you coming to bed, baby?
I' m just gonna have a shower.
Don' t Iet me keep you up.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- And you are Mr...?
- Diaz.
MigueI Diaz.
- A SEP retirement account.
Terrific.
- I am.
- What was your occupation?
I was a high school basketball coach.
- What' s your name?
Greg.
Let me ask you something.
Do you have safe- deposit boxes here?
- In your vault?
- It' s over 100 years old.
Of course, we' ve made some state- of- the- art upgrades since then.
You know, I was once in a vault while it was being robbed.
That must have been quite an experience.
Yeah.
That' s too oxblood.
What do y' all do?
Well, he' s retired.
Just retired.
And I did work at an art gallery.
And, you know, I love art, obviously, and paint and....
I' m sorry.
Do you mind if I --? - hey, it' s your paint.
Thank you.
May I show you something specific?
Well, I was looking for something for my wife.
What is it, a speciaI occasion?
It' s our second third anniversary.
Excuse me. hello, Mrs. Diaz, we were just talking about you.
- How' d it go at the bank?
- It was easy.
I mean great.
No, you mean easy.
What?
You' re doing recon work on our anniversary?
- Let me ask you this:
- Casing a jewelry store.
That' s an interesting way to ease back into society, which was your idea.
Let' s talk about something important.
I can' t find a restaurant for tonight.
- Well, we' il stay in.
- Great.
You talk.
That' s what they make flowers for, you know.
- Oh, no, Danny.
- What is it?
Tess...... what' s wrong?
Hang up!
hello, Tess.
Where is he, Tess?
Where is...... Mr. Diaz?
I want it all back.
- You got it all from the insurance company.
The money that your husband and his 10 friends stole from me.
With interest.
A hundred and sixty million dollars over three years.
That' s a lot of vig.
And I want it all back.
he' s got two weeks.
They' re way too smart for you.
Right.
You know, as it turns out...... I' m not the only person in the world looking for Ocean' s 11.
I' m the groom, and I' m not supposed to say anything, but -- Make a speech.
But I don' t care what the rules are, because I really wanna thank my family.
My mom and dad, my Uncle Gary and Aunt Grace.
And all the guys at Lean Machine Inc., Bobo, Mullethead...... Big Sam.
Thank you.
Excuse me, everybody.
Get up.
- Walk.
I' d like to say a few words about commitment...... about honor...... about responsibility...... about a very special someone and admitting to her....
Get up.
Pull the chair out.
Admitting to her in front of everybody...... that her wedding...... and that very special honeymoon trip to Epcot Center...... will have to be postponed.
Jesus, he' s just a friend.
You met him at The Mint, remember?
You don' t expect me to embarrass myself by flying commercial?
On a budget?
Who was the only person who couldn' t get in on the Chinese cell- phone market?
You, with all your connections.
What was that?
And you do this every time that I meet someone new.
And you know what?
You think it' s a accident no one know about Fred "Bud" Kelly?
There' s one explanation...... and you Iadies know exactly what it is.
I' m gonna tell you what it is.
Conspiracy, collusion, compilcity.
That' s all it is.
That was over there in Nova Scotia.
I' m gonna tell you something else.
You never seen his name on the Stanley Cup.
Because that son of a bitch Jim Crow...... took his name off the history books.
You kind of --
Seems like every time I see you, you' re playing the race card, Frank.
Now, why is that?
You can Iet go of my feet now.
- This don' t bother you?
- Of course it * * * * * * * bothers me, mate.
- What the * * * * do you want me to do?
You can' t hear none of the Iyrics.
You can' t get with the beat with all them * * * * * * * bleeps in it.
You want a * * * * * * * single on the * * * * * * * radio, it' s what you have to * * * * * * * do.
Totally * * * * * *! * * * * * * * right, it' s * * * * * * * * * * * * *.
What the * * * * is that?
Somebody must be in 2.
Oh, * * * *!
And you haven' t contacted my father about any of this?
Because, really, I don' t think there' s any reason to involve him or my mom.
It' s all on you, Linus.
- Good.
Because I have a whole network -- - Get out of my car.
Thank you.
- Mr. Bloom?
There appears to be a silght problem with your card.
Oh, well, yes. here.
I' m afraid not, sir.
Your business manager said you would understand.
Todd said I would understand?
No, Mr. Benedict.
Mr. Benedict.
Mr....
Oh, yes.
An old friend, a practicaI joker.
Tell Mr. Benedict he' s won this round, yes.
Terry Benedict. old Terry.
She' s looking at me from across the room.
And she' s crazy about me, I can tell...... because she' s been staring at me all night.
And I' ve got her really close to me...... and her eyes are all fiery.
And my eyes are fiery.
And it' s like -- It' s electric.
And I say to her, "Mom....
Mother.... "
Thanks for Ietting me finish.
What can I say?
You' re a funny guy.
Oh, yeah.
My friend Rusty.
I' m worried about him. he owns this hotel in Los Angeles...... Iosing a Iot of money, and he' s got no llfe. he' s a nice, bright kid, but he' s beating his brains out.
Do you think I could send something through you, like, a message to him?
I read your palm, not his.
- My hips are bothering me.
This?
You couldn' t see this?
- I tried knocking, he won' t open.
- I' il handle it.
Jesus Christ, are you people retarded?
- It says, "Do not disturb"!
Come on in.
Jeez, Topher, you didn' t have to go all Frankie Muniz on me.
Rust, look, I know this is your joint.
I just....
I love her, man.
I love her, but she is driving me crazy!
I quit the show.
- I mean, it' s like....
God, it' s almost like this Kabbalah crap doesn' t even work!
Rusty, call for you.
Dude, don' t Ieave.
- Yeah?
- I have a message for Robert Charles Ryan...... soon to be ex- owner of the Standard Hotel.
- You got him.
- Last time we spoke, you hung up on me.
You used some nasty words.
I got sensitive ears.
I admit I was a little emotional that evening.
Think about that night a Iot, don' t you?
Otherwise, you would' ve gone out...... to your favorite car of all the 17 you own, and as soon as you turned on the ignition....
You got two weeks.
Now, you told me that your wife said that he called it Ocean' s 1 1.
It was a collaboration.
That moniker is insulting.
I don' t know where this proprietary stance comes from.
One could make the argument that because it was Danny' s idea -- hang on a minute.
We all had our own areas of expertise.
I mean, without us, it don' t Ieave your head, mate.
If you wanted to call it something else --
When you have a problem, who do you go to?
- Rusty.
Thanks.
Let' s get back on the topic.
Based on what we stole, plus interest...
-... how much does everybody owe? - $1 7. 34 million.
Figure 1 9 to be safe.
Okay, 1 9 each.
Anybody got that?
Didn' t you see the signs?
I saw the signs. how much is everybody short? how much you short?
Fourteen.
- All but 5 million?
- Yeah.
You don' t know what it' s like to create something from scratch.
- Well, with interest, I' m short 7.
I spent about a million, mostly on talent development.
That makes it 7 for me.
Boy, the interest just kills you.
- I' m llght 9.
- What' s the interest?
- About 6.
- Then I owe 6. - how?
- What?
I' ve been staying at my parents'.
I owe 25.
hotels, man.
Saul?
I haven' t spent it all, but I will.
As ranking old- timer, I gotta say, I just can' t do it.
At my age, I think I earned the right to be selfish.
But I want the Iast check I write to bounce.
Saul, you having a Iaugh?
Saul.
- You don' t have to.
Who would I talk to if you were all dead?
That' s a good point.
All right, I owe 1 0.
Amazing?
Yeah, but it' s a nice place.
- So that comes to...?
- Ninety- seven, give or take. he didn' t find us on his own.
- Someone helped him.
Nobody we know would violate rule number one.
We need a high- paying job.
We' re too hot to work anywhere in this country.
- So we go abroad. how about we go --?
Good.
- Amsterdam.
- Amsterdam it is.
Let' s go.
- Never been to Amsterdam.
I hear German girls are really hot.
- Amsterdam?
Don' t tell Danny.
hey, Rusty.
What are you doing?
- Nothing.
Can I --?
- Just for a second, can I talk to you?
- What' s wrong?
- I' ve been thinking.
And I' d really like...... to play a more centraI role this time around.
- Right.
I was wondering if I could come to the meeting and help you guys negotiate.
he' s got his own Ianguage, this guy.
I Iearned a ton.
Linus, in my professionaI opinion, you' re not ready.
- Okay.
Yeah, I mean -- - But -- But -- But...... if you' re convinced you are ready...... I can speak with Danny.
But you gotta be sure.
- Not sure?
- No, I am.
- You would call me?
Any time.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Then I' d still be sleeping.
- Who' s there?
- What?
- It' s Linus.
Is Rusty here?
- Do you know where Rusty is?
So have you met Matsui?
Seriously, what do you think of me...... you know, in terms of just Ieadership potential?
Don' t mention Benedict unless he does first.
And if he does, tell him everything.
Stay on point.
And don' t forget the other thing I told you.
- What?
Relax.
Remember, if we don' t get this job, we' re dead.
Rusty, I tried calling you all yesterday.
So finally, she slams her vodka tonic down on the tray and says: "hey, maybe that' s why I' ve been feellng so warm recently."
- To business.
Later, he will wake up in front of the television...... but not remember his dream.
would you agree?
If all the animals along the equator were capable of flattery...... then Thanksgiving and halloween...... would fall on the same date.
When I was 4 years old...... I watched my mother kill a spider with a tea cozy.
It was my Uncle harold.
I am a traveler in both time and space
Are we all right?
- "Kashmir"?
- We hadn' t even started yet.
- We were this close to Iosing that.
Okay, I don' t even understand what happened in there.
- A cheap one.
- She' s 7.
- Confined to bed with a case of --
Okay.
So, what does this mean?
It means you stay here.
The mark' s name is van der Woude.
A semi- known, wealthy recluse.
He claims to sell antiques, but hasn' t actually sold one.
His store is his privately owned home, which no one ever enters.
But don' t let van der Woude' s eccentricity fool you.
The house is extremely well- protected.
It' s a very old, very valuable document.
The first one ever issued from the first corporation on the planet.
Dutch East India Trading Company.
- The only one of its kind.
2. 5 million euro.
Wait.
Each?
- Who negotiated this?
- That' s a Iot of money to a Iot of people.
- Are you out of your mind?
- September 2005.
I hear you, but it' s what' s avallable.
- Which will buy an extension from Benedict.
I hope.
Now, the good news is that Matsui gave us the system' s master code.
- Van der Woude.
- That' s the bad news. - he never leaves. - he' s agoraphobic. - he' s never been out of his house?
- Not in 10 years since he moved in.
- What does that mean?
- Best time of arrival.
Every night at 1: 30 he takes an Ambien, puts on Beethoven' s Third.
By the fourth movement, he' s out like a llght.
So we go in at 3 a. m.
Okay, can we tap into the system from the phone llnes?
It' s a closed- Ioop system with two servers Iocked in titanium cases next to his bed.
Telephone- repair truck, basket up to the second floor.
Telescoping rod through the window, tap out the freak' s code.
- Dumb idea.
One Iane, one- way streets.
Any stoppage will bring cops.
Monitored 24 hours a day by a security company. he' s got five exterior cameras?
- Super freak.
What about through the roof?
- Yeah.
- Smoke the freak out. - hey!
- Do we have to use that term?
- "Freak."
The NationaI Institute of MentaI health estimates 5. 6 percent of adults...
Whatever.
I' m just saying, I mean, do we...?
We don' t need to be an organization that Iabels people.
Oh, now we' re an organization?
You' d call Emily Dickinson a freak?
- Who' s Emily Dickinson?
You know, a handicapped guy?
- Well, I don' t care. - hell, yeah.
But....
- But....
- Right.
- Ahab with a piggyback.
- I can get anything.
- Boys.
That whole "Ahab with a piggyback," that' s not real?
- Let me in. - how do you think it feels...
-... when someone bangs on the door?
Come on.
I' ve been doing this since I' m 12 years old.
You gotta find people you can delegate to.
I don' t want a llfe.
Reuben.
Yeah.
- Okay.
- Maybe.
Remember in Miller' s Crossing where Turturro begs for his llfe?
Sure.
"Look into your heart."
I cry every time.
What?
There' s no clear shot, even with Basher.
- Nagel.
Spoke with him.
- Anything?
Lot of ideas, none of them any good. he' s pushing this new holographic technology.
Really interesting stuff, though. he can reproduce anything 3- D. how about 97 million?
We' re forcing it.
Yeah, we' re forcing it.
- You know what we haven' t thought of?
We turn ourselves in.
- What could Benedict do to us then?
Call the cops, tell them we did the Bellagio job.
That' d teach him.
I think Tess would stick around.
- Sucks. - how' s East haven?
I don' t know.
Can' t turn my brain off, you know.
We go into some place, and all I can do is see the angles.
It' s what I do.
It' s what I' ve always done.
Some sort of weird irony, you know?
Tess watching me scratch and itch. hey, llsten.
You know, the world' s gone nuts and you' re....
- The whole house?
- We' re just raising it silghtly.
- We can' t tilt a house.
- Did it with the Leaning Tower of Pizza.
- Exactly, thank you.
- It took 300 men over two years to do it.
We cut them, insert the jacks and crank away.
It' s really our best plan, considering it' s our only plan.
- Crank for how long?
- Like I said, it' s our only plan.
What?
Oh, oh, okay, hold on.
Try that.
Number five.
Master thieves who practice the Iong con live separate lives as civilians.
They have Iegitimate jobs and families...... which make them extremely difficult to catch.
The greatest thief of all time was, without question...... Gaspar LeMarc, who either dled in PortugaI in 1 988...... or in hong Kong in 1 996, or he' s still alive.
We may never know for certain, because LeMarc...... was never captured or photographed...... despite being active for over 50 years.
The thief we know only as the Night Fox.
So named for the small onyx figurines he Ieaves behind to taunt us...... the Night Fox must be considered our number- one priority. his string of high- profile crimes are an embarrassment to our branch...... to our entire profession.
We need more than traditionaI resources to pursue thieves like the Night Fox.
We need to train ourselves to think the way they think, to see what they see.
Someone just robbed the van der Woude house.
hi, Isabel.
Well, we could really use your help on this one.
I hope the scene hasn' t been contaminated.
When can I speak to Mr. van der Woude?
Probably tomorrow. he' s heavily sedated.
We can' t figure out how they disabled the alarm.
Shorted it out somehow?
No, that would have triggered the system and damaged the circuits.
Then I don' t know how they got in.
They had the code.
Someone other than the owner must have known it.
Impossible.
Redundant servers.
It' s not bad, actually.
Do we know each other?
- I think I saw you yesterday.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah, you were being chased by the pollce.
Chasing me?
I don' t think so.
I' m quite sure it was you.
Doesn' t say much for the police.
I love it.
It' s in Amsterdam.
- The whole house.
- The entire house.
It' s called a Schumann Special...... named after this guy, a brilliant guy, Max Schumann.
Then he did it in Istanbul in 1973.
What is it?
It' s where the crossbow bolt hit.
The crossbow bolt?
They fired from that rooftop through this open window.
- That' s a very difficult shot.
- No, it is an impossible shot...... until they raised the building.
Check the pylons.
They' il be elevated.
- You know the name Max Schumann?
- Well, they do.
- Who?
The Americans.
Wait a minute.
Why would they bring the drill if they weren' t planning to use it?
- What?
- Oh, God.
Congratulations.
You are the second person to crack the van der Woude safe tonight.
In arriving second, Mr. Ocean, you havejoined a long line...... of people who' ve worked hard and risked a great deal only to get somewhere second.
You don' t know these people by name, of course, because they enter oblivion.
You know this word, "oblivion"?
It means to be totally forgotten by everyone forever.
And it' s where you would be now if it weren' t for the Bellagio heist. how does this guy know who we are?
In a way, I' m responsible for you coming to Amsterdam in the first place.
I hired Matsui, and Matsui hired you.
That' s the guy who dimed us to Benedict.
- Yes.
I find that hard to believe.
And you are?
You can call me the Night Fox.
The Night Fox.
Okay, Mr. Night Fox.
- What will this information cost me?
Nothing?
Who do you think you' re deallng with?
Nothing costs nothing.
And this information is definitely worth something.
Let' s just say our interests are temporarily aligned. how so?
Well, the information is free, but it comes with certain conditions.
- Such as?
Restraint?
That' s asking a Iot.
What else?
Two weeks to buy themselves out of trouble.
Two weeks?
I can live with that, even if they can' t.
Just out of curiosity, what will you make them pay?
For Ietting them live?
Everything they stole, plus interest.
A Iot of interest.
But didn' t your insurance cover what was stolen?
Of course.
So you' re asking them to double your money?
Fair?
I certainly hope not.
So, what about the information?
It' s on your desk.
he was here.
I can tell.
- Who?
- The Night Fox.
Go down to the Dampkring and pick up a guy called Matsui.
Real name, Ian Nicolas McNally.
The Night Fox was here at the same time as the Americans?
That' s what we' re gonna find out.
What is he doing?
Get him out of there.
God.
hello, Frank.
Doesn' t matter. he broke rule number one. he' s on the llst.
Great time for a turf war.
I spoke with Frank' s associate in Dubiln.
She' s trying to get us a name on this guy.
Our train Ieaves tomorrow at 1: 38, okay?
- I don' t know.
It' s gonna get out.
Then we' il be dead, and no one will wanna work with us. housekeeping.
Turndown service for Mr. Ryan.
hi.
Nice room.
You have it all to yourself?
You here to take me in?
Why would I do that?
It' s not as if you stole something.
It' s nice to see you again, Robert.
You too.
Of course, you' ve been seeing plenty of me, haven' t you?
I like this one.
I call it "thief à Ia mode."
Schumann Special, huh?
I guess that' s what I get for opening my mouth.
So, what about the Night Fox?
Did he Ieave you a message?
You still have it?
I suppose it' s a compliment in a way.
I guess he' s threatened by you, though I can' t imagine why.
You have no idea what you' re up against.
The French police think he' s better than LeMarc.
Well, he is French.
Let me give you some advice.
Beg for mercy.
Got to go.
Any message for Frank? he' s been hanging around the station.
On what charge?
And?
Bought with a fraudulent credit card.
From that point on, well, there' s only one, maybe two great nail salons in Amsterdam.
- Yeah, and to me.
Well, Frank knew.
- Frank knew you were in touch?
- I wasn' t in touch.
I was more like keeping tabs.
- She' s a cop!
- Detective, actually.
- Where' d she learn all that Schumann crap?
- What, he was a cop?
- Thief.
- Oh, God.
Was he good?
Great.
Pissed- off ex- girlfriend whose thief father...... taught her every trick in the book.
In the next 48 hours, your pictures will be in every pollce station.
- Nobody looks at them.
- Nobody but cops.
- Detectives.
-... if her old man was a thief.
- Is that sympathy or empathy?
No, her old man got popped a day before her 9th birthday. dled in jall.
So I wouldn' t count on much sympathy.
She' s gonna have the hotel under survelllance.
We' il just eat room service, watch movies and wait for Benedict to kill us.
- Adams.
- John Travolta. - he said every problem...... is an opportunity in disguise. he couldn' t say that with a. 45 in his mouth.
No, you' re missing the sliver lining here.
Now, she gave us a name, didn' t she?
The Night Fox.
One phone call, we' re gonna find out everything there is to know about this guy.
The name is M. Diaz.
It' s a black duffeI bag.
The team' s in Rotterdam.
The bag' s in Brussels. he' s the modern man: disconnected, frightened...... paranoid, but with good reason.
It' s too sad to be funny.
- I think I can get 20 minutes out of it.
I got it.
The team' s in Barcelona.
The bag' s in Madrid.
This is a moral issue we' re dealing with here.
And we don' t have a grease man anymore, because he' s in a bag somewhere.
We got a bag man.
Such an ape.
An animal with no feelings.
- I have feelings.
- No, you don' t.
I feel bad for the guy. he' s in a piece of Iuggage, but he' s got water.
- What did you want them to do?
- Get off the bus.
And pick up the bag with our friend in it. how many pro soccer teams are fielding 50- year- old men?
Rusty' s not 50 years old.
Yeah, dude, we know Rusty' s not 50.
You think I' m 50 years old?
Let me ask you something.
No, wait, let me ask you something. how old do you think I am?
Forty- eight.
You think I' m 48 years old?
Fifty- two?
- Maybe he should' ve asked me.
That guy doesn' t have a hard enough llfe right now?
You gotta --
You' re gonna defend him?
They put Yen in a handbag.
- Can I ask you something?
- If you' re gonna ask a question...... give me time to respond, unless it' s rhetorical...... in which case the answer is obvious: yes.
- Okay, can I ask --?
- Yes.
- You ever notice that Tess looks exactly --?
- Don' t ever ask that.
Especially not to her.
Why not?
Look.
It' s not in my nature to be mysterious...... but I can' t talk about it, and I can' t talk about why.
Do I look 50 to you?
- Yeah.
- Really?
- Well, I mean, only from the neck up.
Saul?
What' s the matter?
Nothing.
It' s nice.
No.
You wanna watch something?
The game' s on.
- You hungry?
I' il heat something up.
Saul, ever since you got back, you' ve been acting strange.
What did Danny want?
Nothing.
Nothing? how could he want nothing?
All right, the Night Fox has a name.
François Toulour.
Baron François Toulour.
Father was a French industrialist, mother was Italian nobility.
The bad news is he' s rich, he' s bored and he' s talented.
The really bad news is he was trained by LeMarc.
- This is not good.
- With the LeMarc?
Gaspar LeMarc?
That' s the one.
- Well, we' re doomed.
- We' re not doomed.
- He' s one guy, and he' s French.
Before we get too impressed by his background...
- He started in the '90s.
Bank of Geneva, the Danish Treasury, the Bank of Italy, AMC Amro...... the Brussels Diamond Exchange, Antwerp Diamond Exchange.
All those in the 1990s?
- I' m only up to '96.
- In '97, he went through an art phase.
He hit the Tate in London, the Louvre in Paris, twice, and the Prado.
The Prado Museum in '97?
That was Moretti.
- Everybody knows that -- - He is Moretti.
It' s one of his aliases.
In 2002, he stole the king of Morocco' s 200- foot yacht.
Couldn' t remember a thing.
- How do you hide a 200- foot yacht?
He now plays tennis with Toulour every weekend.
- We' re in some serious trouble here.
- Copy that.
- So, what do we do?
- We respond.
- Respond?
How?
Mr. Ocean.
You broke rule number one, and that has consequences.
Oh, you must be talking about the paintings.
You' il be dead in five days, and I' il get my paintings back.
- Unless you have an accident first.
- I don' t think so, Daniel.
Perhaps I should explain to you why I' m tormenting you.
I' d like that.
Last month I was in Portugal to see my mentor.
- LeMarc.
- Indeed.
A very loud and annoying American businessman was there the same day.
He worked for a big insurance company.
He' s the one who suggested Benedict to you as a potential mark.
- You know the man?
- What about him?
But the worst part is that LeMarc never corrected him.
And he answered that it was impossible to know for sure.
So I thought about that for, like, three weeks in a row, day and night.
And then suddenly, I realized that he was actually right.
It is impossible to compare one theft to the other.
So I guess the only way to know who' s the best of us for sure...... is to go after the same object.
Don' t you think that would be fun?
You' re being awfully cavalier with a lot of people' s lives so you can play out a game.
You' re gonna regret it.
Come on, Mr. Ocean. how are you gonna possibly get $97 million by next Wednesday?
Especially if every safe you crack between now and then is already empty?
Whereas if you accept my challenge and win...... I promise I' il pay your debt to Benedict...... and LeMarc will hold my money in escrow as a guarantee.
What are we steallng?
The famous Fabergé Coronation Egg.
- Was that your idea or LeMarc' s?
- I think he would agree...... that it' s the most appropriate thing for us to compete over.
The egg left Paris this morning on its way to Rome.
It travels with heavy security and usually with one or more replicas.
Sometimes they even show the replicas without anybody knowing.
When the egg goes on display Monday morning...... you' il have 48 hours to steal it before your deadline' s up.
When the deadline passes and you don' t have the egg...... LeMarc will know who' s the best.
- Rusty' s phone.
Nicole.
Where' s Rusty?
He said if you called, to say he was at Gunther' s.
Gunther' s?
What' s that about?
Do you have a message?
And tell him I had to go three times as thin on the Iayers.
And tell him this thing is beautiful.
Would fool the bloody Romanovs themselves.
And tell him I' m being a nice guy.
Is that it?
Yeah.
Tell him having a sexy female assistant...... is such a terrible cliché.
Can I get a coffee or something?
Thanks.
You call me on Saturday and ask me to come into my office...... and sign a 1077...... and you can' t even tell me what they are after?
- I can come to your house.
- We' il talk about this on Wednesday.
- It' il be gone by Wednesday.
What?
- Something worth signing a 1077 for.
Ryan and his friends did the Bellagio casino heist in 2001.
-... then we should call the American FBl -- - No, no, no.
- Maurizio, llsten to me.
- Agent Lahiri...... a 1077 is not a small thing.
Unless you can tell me what they are after, there is no point in discussing it.
hey --
Because LeMarc stole it in 1 980 when 23 others falled.
Because the Night Fox is trying to prove he' s better than Ryan and his friends.
This is ridiculous.
Then you say LeMarc already stole it 24 years ago.
- Which one is it?
- Both.
LeMarc' s wife made him put the egg back.
When I signed a 1077 for you on the Bulgari case...... you requisitioned 30 of my men for three months and made zero arrests.
I won' t do it again.
The laser grid in the Great Hall' s impossible to beat.
- Nothing' s impossible.
All right.
So it' s a daytime play.
We' re still short three on the inside since Isabel made you and Yen and Danny.
We could try a Smuggler' s Paradise.
- It hasn' t worked since the '50s.
- '54, actually.
Baby Jane, Squeaky Wheel, followed by a Number- Two Son.
We can' t do it without a grease man on the inside, without Yen.
We' il have to risk it.
We' il put him in disguise.
1 0: 1 0, I Ieave the café, proceed west.
- I enter the second- floor bathroom.
Approach the Spanish Steps from the south.
Basher and I enter by the main entrance.
- 1 0: 1 5?
- I help Yen into the ventilation duct.
- I move Reuben to the Egg Room.
- I pause in the Great hall while -- - I go to the Egg Room.
I signaI Linus.
- I then go to the Egg Room.
- I blind camera one.
- I make the switch.
- I pull to the corner of the main entrance.
I meet Danny at the Steps.
1 0: 25?
Turk and I make the drop.
All right.
Really good stuff, guys.
Really good work.
All right, we' il pick it up here in an hour.
- 1 0: 45, we all get arrested.
You bet. - how was Toulour? - he was predictable.
You hear from Nagel? he' il be here.
That' s a lot to presume from a guy like Nagel.
This is Isabel.
Ijust set a 6: 00 meeting for you with an Andre Ciment...... who says he had four paintings stolen from his house in Lake Como.
- And when was this?
He' s missing two Monets, a Turner and a Degas.
- Which Degas was it?
Supposedly, there' s surveillance video, but I haven' t been able to confirm that yet.
It is all about error correction.
Three thousand separate, translucent, digitaI slivers...... instead of the 1 000 I thought it would be.
But I think the color rendition is pretty damn accurate.
Batteries are in the base.
Two minutes maximum.
You' re good.
- It' s good, Roman.
- I think I am.
You' d have never got past that grid.
That' s why you' re paying me double.
- You got my message.
Early Bond.
The message I left with Sexy Phone Voice Nicole.
On your mobile.
Got something going with Gunther?
Am I in?
- Okay, when did you Ieave the message?
- Two days ago.
She had your phone.
- That means that she' s --?
- Yeah.
- Well, you better -- - Yeah.
- That' s great.
So who' s got my money?
Who has got my bloody money?
Jesus.
Sorry to hear about your mom.
She was an amazing....
Well, I thought so, at Ieast.
I should' ve picked up on that.
- She hated all thieves.
- No wonder you fought.
Excuse me?
- May I have my phone back?
- That' s a nice pull, by the way.
Did you get that tingling sensation down your spine when you did it?
Or is that none of my business?
You considered a career change? have you?
I tried hotels.
Went by the café for some tiramisu.
- Who' s the Night Fox?
- They did something to the eggs.
- Why accept his challenge?
Because he' il Iose.
And how can you beat him?
You' re not making any sense.
The Bulgari job you pulled with Frank when we were together...... I knew it was you.
Why didn' t you say something?
Why didn' t you...... Robert?
I didn' t want it to end.
You assumed it would.
Was I wrong?
You shouldn' t be here.
I have a meeting.
Someone stole a whole bunch of paintings in Lake Como.
Interesting.
Any leads?
And Ocean and anybody else I recognize.
Fair enough.
- Ready?
My Blue Dancers, my Degas.
They took it, unfortunately, and I really would like --
Anybody out there who would feel wronged by you?
No.
I can' t see anyone.
You think -- You think maybe the thief...... is trying to harm me personally now?
Well, I assumed he was after the paintings themselves.
It' s plenty.
I doubt it, this level of thief, but I' il take a look.
You never know.
Okay.
Thank you, Mademoiselle Lahiri, for everything.
Did you get the faxed copy of the 1077?
Metal detectors, extra cameras.
Do you happen to have a pen?
I' il just give you the names.
Okay.
Livingston Dell, male, Caucasian, 5' 6 ", 1 50 pounds.
Virgil Malloy, male, Caucasian, 5 '1 0 ", 1 60 pounds.
- hello?
- Buon giorno, Mr. elsenhower.
This is your 5 a. m. wake- up call.
- Really?
- Yes, I' m afraid.
Have a nice day, sir.
- hey.
- What are you doing?
Sleeping.
We gotta go.
The night before.
Oh, he' s mean. he' s just mean- spirited. - how many espressos did you have?
Yeah, come on.
I don' t know if she' s just confused...... or she' s really turned the corner and hates me now.
You think I handled this wrong?
I was too American.
She' s different.
Maybe you' re right, maybe she has moved on.
You know, I talked to a doctor about getting that tattoo removed.
But given its Iocation, he advised against it.
That guy doing Potsie is unbellevable.
I mean, what' s this guy' s problem? he' s stitched us up twice in two weeks, all over his ego.
It' s the first decent evening we' ve had together in I don' t know how long.
All right, all right, Iet' s just stay on point here.
Let' s go over the list again.
Who died and made you Danny?
No one.
My emotions are all over the place.
I was forceful, trying to show good leadership --
- For fuck' s sake.
- You' re a good leader.
Thanks.
All right, well, Iet' s go over the llst again.
- Not enough people.
- Not enough people.
- Soft Shoulder?
- Baker' s Dozen?
We can' t train a cat that quickly.
- What about Tess?
- What about her?
Well, you know how she kind of looks like --
- Yeah, what' s your point?
So we do a Lookie- loo.
- It' s a Lookie- loo with a Bundle of Joy.
- A Lookie- Ioo with Tess...... and a Bundle of Joy?
You' ve gone right out of your tree, my son. he' s mad.
It' s crazy.
It' s Itallan- television crazy, and we' re still one short.
No, think about it.
She can get near the egg during dayilght with half the system down.
I mean, that' s a trifecta.
he might be right.
Make the calls.
Linus Caldwell, you are not following the procedures...... Danny talked about if Terry Benedict shows up.
Something is wrong.
What is wrong?
He' s with Rusty.
During this part of the plan, they can' t communicate with us.
Promise he isn' t hurt.
I promise he isn' t hurt.
You' re gonna miss the deadilne.
Danny would be thrilled if you met him in Rome when thejob' s finished.
He misses you like crazy.
Plus, you studled art, so I know how much you love Rome.
There' s no downside here.
Wow, they' re bringing you along fast, aren' t they?
Yes.
Danny would be more thrilled...... if you were on the 7 p. m. out of JFK, which means you have to leave right now.
I thought I' d requested a midsize.
- Danny here? - he wanted to be.
Did you have a nice flight?
We weren' t sure if you were a window or aisle person. - how long' s Danny been in jall?
- Just a couple of days, really.
Which, you know, on the bright side, he' s completely safe from Benedict. he told me everything was fine. he lied right to me.
What I think he meant by "fine" is we' re running low on time and money...... and we' re deeper in debt than when we started.
I assume that you have a plan to get him out.
- Actually, she sounds like her.
- No, she needs a Southern accent.
- Can you do a Southern --?
- What the hell is going on with you guys?
The accent is crucial.
It' s the first thing people notice.
- This ridiculous car, what is it doing?
- Okay, I' m sorry.
All right, I' m just gonna level with you.
Due to certain personneI losses...... that we have sustained...... we' re -- Various readjustments had to be made.
You' re gonna have to play a small role in this thing.
Okay?
I' d like you to put this hat on.
You' re gonna put on that, and you' re gonna stuff it with that.
And we' il turn around, just give you a little moment.
Small role.
Who am I supposed to be?
Well....
Oh, really?
Well, absolutely.
I can have -- We can make the suite available.
No, no, no trouble at all.
I mean, we would love -- We are honored that she would think of us again.
Okay.
Thank you.
how is this going to get Danny out?
- We needed someone famous.
- Why didn' t you get someone famous?
Just think Four Weddings and a Funeral.
She wasn' t in Four Weddings and a Funeral.
"I." "I wasn' t in Four Weddings and a Funeral."
Just protect your fake baby.
I' m hyperventilating.
- Welcome back, Signora Roberts.
She' s very tired.
Oh, let' s hide.
Julia?
My name is Teresa.
I thought I saw a friend of mine, someone that I know.
No, absolutely not.
You can' t turn off the pressure sensors.
Well, she can' t touch it.
She' s a movie star.
You were born in 1967.
- You like croquet and knitting.
You' ve got 10 dogs, seven horses.
- Your favorite color is peach.
- She doesn' t have more horses than dogs.
- I can' t do this.
I can' t.
- Tess, we' re out of time.
- Julia.
No, we understand you' re feeling insecure.
That is totally natural.
- You' re playing an actress.
They' re insecure.
I' m freaking out.
That' s right.
You' re playing a role.
No, you' re playing a role.
- Yeah, so?
- It' s just wrong.
You mean, like, morally?
No.
Well, yes.
The point is you want me to speak...... for someone who' s out there somewhere.
It' s too personal.
More personal than your husband doing 25- to- life? he won' t do 25- to- life.
Benedict will have him killed immediately.
- I' m sorry, that was stupid.
We' re gonna be in and out in 1 0 minutes.
That' s our time frame.
You don' t even have to talk.
Give them a big smile, wave at the cameras.
- But if you do say something...... don' t forget your accent.
Drop your G' s, and longer vowels.
Room service.
You are an image to these people.
You' re like an object.
Nobody actually knows you.
The last thing this is gonna be is personal.
- Aren' t you overdue?
- Why are you in Rome?
- I' m here on vacation.
- I love you.
You are not supposed to fly eight months pregnant.
- I know.
- Is Danny here?
- Of course.
- Danny.
- No, no, I mean, he has -- - he' s working?
- Yes.
- In Rome?
- Bruce.
Glen Snackwell, pubilcity. - hey, Glen.
- Thanks.
You fired Marcy?
You fired Marcy.
Two weeks ago, you told me I should go with Marcy.
- I' m sorry.
- Tell him what happened with Marcy, Glen.
- There' s a story?
- Marcy -- Marcy....
- You should sit down.
I' m with the studio.
Marcy' s still very much in the picture.
I just wanted to get you for a second.
You know, that little statue on the mantle starts smirking at you after a while.
- Not really, Glen, no.
- Sorry.
Yeah. hey, Jules, that reminds me.
I' ve been meaning to call you since the girls and I were in Taos.
- It' s so good to see you.
These are a mess.
Anyway, Tallulah left her SpongeBob blanket in the red casita.
- So, what I wanna do -- here.
- Thank you.
- Is call Marcus...... and have him get ahold of Louise so we can make arrangements to get it. he' s home now, right?
- That' s so funny.
- Go ahead. talk to him.
Over by the window, with the reception.
- Hello? - hello, Marcus?
No, it' s Julia.
Who' s this?
It' s Julla.
I' m with Bruce Willis.
You' re with Bruce right now?
Can I speak with him?
Oh, yes, Tallulah' s SpongeBob.
- I' m sorry, can I talk to him for a sec?
- Yes, it fell out.
- That' s been happening all week.
- Put that phone away right now.
- What? hang it up and put it away.
Do you have any idea how vulnerable...... a fetus' brain is to the electromagnetic field created by your cell phone?
You might as well point a gun at her stomach.
- I am Julla' s physician. - he' s a doctor.
What happened to Dr. Webber?
- Dr. Webber is on vacation.
- Well, he' s sick. - he' s sick on vacation.
- Sick on vacation.
- Don' t you hate that?
Sick on vacation.
Sorry to have jumped on you, Mr. Willis.
Thank you.
- Snackbar.
- Snackwell.
It doesn' t matter.
If we are to get there at 4: 00 and do that....
- Closer than that.
- 2 - 1 they don' t make it to the museum.
- 5 - 1 they don' t make it to the Egg Room.
- She' s still my wife.
- She' s a novice.
- Led by an apprentice.
- Being tracked by a pro.
You want her to win.
- Which her?
- You know which her.
- The one that started all this.
For a minute -- - Why would I say that?
It' s not her fault.
- Good.
- Good.
- I' m confused.
- Yeah, who are you talking about?
- Isabel.
- I loved it, but I figured it out.
- That' s amazing.
- The second she doesn' t...... talk to you in the restaurant, I knew --
You figured that out.
- Yeah, I mean, the movie still works for me.
- Great.
Does she really need to be rushing this quickly?
- She' s practically jogging.
- In Thalland...... mothers routinely give birth in rice paddies and then go right back to work.
- Amazing women over there.
- Rice paddy?
And she will be very comfortable because she will be strong...... from this walk and this exercise.
Was she worth it?
Was Tess?
The moment that she doesn' t talk to you in the restaurant, I knew.
- No.
- That' s when you figured it out, huh?
- But the movie was still enjoyable for me.
- Okay.
Thanks.
If everybody' s so freaking smart, how come the movie did $675 million worldwide...... theatrical?
Doctor.
Doctor, you might wanna call the rice paddy now.
SeaI off the museum.
Nobody in or out.
- Bring -- Bring it, bring it.
Sit her down.
- Everybody just relax.
- Can you hear me? talk to me.
- She is fine.
She is fine.
She' s good?
Okay, that' s it.
We' re done here.
No more pictures.
- Just don' t worry.
- Thank you, museum.
We are code four.
- Walk slowly, like you' re doing.
Don' t stop. - hello.
- We' re on our way out.
IsabeI Lahiri, I' m with the museum.
It is so great to meet you.
- We' re very Iate.
- I' m sorry, this won' t take Iong.
I don' t wanna be an annoying fan, but my boyfriend is such a huge fan.
I can' t Iet you Ieave unless you sign something for him.
- Sorry, it won' t take Iong.
- What' s his name? - his name' s Robert.
Aren' t you a lefty?
I thought you were a lefty.
She is a lefty.
Often pregnant women become ambidextrous.
You are a big fan.
She doesn' t necessarily have to sign lefty.
This is great.
We' re on the move.
Thank you.
You take care, now.
And one more thing.
I just got off the phone...... with someone called Marcy who put you on a plane from Taos, New Mexico to L. A...... where you have a 1: 00 meeting about a film, Clowns Can' t Sleep.
Anyway, she just wanted me to Iet you know everyone' s running a llttle Iate...... and was wondering if you could make it at 1: 30 instead.
I knew it.
Shame on you.
Bruce.
IsabeI Lahiri.
Nice to meet you.
Or were you just --?
Was that just part of the whole thing with them?
So how' d it go?
You Lahiri?
I' m Section Chief Molly Starr.
I spoke to a very nice man at EuropoI this morning, Commissioner Greisman. he wants you on the next filght to Amsterdam.
There seems to be some irregularity with your paperwork.
That one.
Let' s start with that one.
Imagine yourself in a room...... that' s too short for you to stand up in and not wide enough for you to lle down in.
A room with no llght, no heat...... and stone walls scratched by the teeth and nalls of desperate men...... men driven crazy by isolation.
You will have rats for company...... and a small window that looks out on the world that has passed you by.
Your parents will grow old and die, just like your dreams.
Your friends will forget your name, tell your stories as their own...... because what good is a story when the person who owns it has vanished?
- What do you want?
- Testify against the others...... in the Benedict case.
You and the others will be extradited to the U. S. this afternoon.
Plead, and you walk with parole.
I can' t.
Think about it, Linus.
For a moment there, I was already forgetting your name.
Wait.
Just hang on a sec.
Linus.
Right.
You okay?
- Well, I blew the meet with Matsui.
- Matsui?
Let me guess. he pulled a Lost in Translation on you.
That' s his idea of fun for first- timers.
- Obvious.
I hope Danny and Rusty appreciate the job you did in a tight jam.
I am proud of you.
- Thanks.
- We both are.
You told Dad?
- You told Dad?
- We were on vacation.
I' m sorry.
Thanks.
You' re gonna be dining out on this one for months. "hey, remember the time your mom had to come to Rome...."
I' m sorry.
It' s like a....
- And that...
I' m sorry I kept you in the dark.
I' m sorry that I made you a thief.
- Master.
- Master thief.
And I' m very sorry that I ruined our second third anniversary.
You forgive me?
Was he --?
That' s Ryan' s car.
Follow that one.
hey, wait, wait!
What the hell is going on?
Your father' s alive, Izzy.
Your mom lled to you...
-... to keep you from him. he' s alive.
- What are you talking about?
When they divorced, she told him if he contacted you, she' d go to the cops...... with everything to put him in jall. how do you know that?
And why should I believe you?
I don' t believe you, okay?
You know where he is?
I know somebody who does.
There' s nothing back there but a forged 1 077.
Really?
No.
- No.
That' d be horrible.
It' s hard, you know, for dinners.
Well, you must have very good contacts.
I hear it usually takes days to buy your way out.
- Tess, this is François Toulour.
- Madame Ocean, at Iast. - hello. - he' s French.
Shouldn' t you be somewhere else by now, like...... Outer Mongolla, maybe?
Well, before we get to that, we just wanted to ask you one question.
- What is that? - how' d you do it?
Oh, so that' s why you came.
Well, I guess that' s normal.
But I got another deal for you.
You both recognize that I' m the best, and I' il tell you my secret.
- That....
- Oh, okay.
- All right.
We' il tell you you' re the best after you tell us how you did it.
how can I refuse a dying man' s Iast request?
The egg arrived in Rome at 6: 45 p. m. the Saturday before it went on display.
- It was at the museum by 8 p. m.
- Wait a minute, hold on.
You stole it that evening?
How' d you get in the building?
Why didn' t my recon team see you?
- Don' t touch my thing.
- I didn' t touch your thing.
Like it works.
You got greasy hands, you put them on the Iens.
Now I can' t see.
- I see you.
You look like a retard.
You look like a retard.
I' il pay you a million dollars if you don' t speak for a month.
One month.
- I wanna eat your whole head.
- Go ahead.
A million dollars.
No joke.
Right.
With no equipment, no rope.
Of course.
Come on, don' t tell me you don' t know how to do that. how did you get by the Iaser field in the Great hall?
The Iaser fields.
Toulour, you' re the best.
Well, thank you, Danny.
Now, if you can just get us our money...... we' il be going.
The money?
What money?
The money that you agreed to pay Benedict if we won.
- We' re under a deadilne.
- No, no, no, you don' t understand.
You didn' t win.
You Iost.
And not only did you Iose...... your entire crew got pinched.
I gotta tell you something.
You don' t look anything like her.
Eventually, the nose, but the ears --
That means that you spoke to LeMarc.
You spoke to LeMarc?
Since I' m dead, I think my involvement in this should stay among the three of us.
- Absolutely.
It' s ironic that the solution to all of our problems will be provided by Toulour.
I' m sure I provoked him by agreeing with my American friend that you might be better.
I apologize sincerely for the trouble I' ve caused you.
- Especially now.
Remember, from the time you see Toulour at his villa and the challenge begins...... you must assume he will have you under survelllance everywhere you go.
You' il have to put on a very elaborate show.
- Thank you.
You saved our lives, Gaspar.
And I' m still getting the better of you.
And I stole a repilca?
Your paintings are in a high- security warehouse in Milan.
It' s 1 7 Via Andreotti, unit 222.
- Security code is 2- 3- 1 - 1 - 6 -- - 6- 4- 6.
Thank you.
Listen, all games aside, that was -- That was very good.
That was good. how' d you do that?
I think that' il be enough.
So now...... if you, both of you, could please....
- Whose house is this?
- It belongs to a thief I know in Paris. he knows my father?
Probably better than anyone.
Who is he? - he helped with the whole Night Fox thing.
I don' t know, actually.
I' ve only known him as LeMarc.
LeMarc?
Oh, my God.
Where the hell have you been?
Waiting.
For what?
For this.
Oh, my God.
So we done?
Issue closed?
- Is it actually good?
Trust me.
I don' t trust you, and I don' t trust Ocean.
If it' s good, we' re done.
Nobody wins.
And the competition, it' s worse than our business.
Always some new young punk trying to prove himself.
Guys like Ocean, they keep coming back.
They don' t like to Iose.
- Too much ego, too much pride.
- Maybe for some guys, but not Danny.
Trust me on that.
Danny don' t feel like he Iost in all this.
It' s hard to believe, but that' s how he feels.
Well, if he tries anything -- If anybody tries anything, I' il be waiting.
Terry, I can' t predict the future.
I pay professionals to do that, and even they get it wrong sometimes.
If, God forbid, anything does happen to you...... we will not be involved.
You better not be, Reuben.
You better not be.
hey.
Good to see you guys.
You put me through hell, and you don' t remember?
- You' re more beautifuI than ever. - hey!
- Four- oh- five.
- Who' s winning?
- You' re big?
Oh, my God. - hello.
You' re thieves.
Isabel, Livingston Dell.
Thank you.
Isabel, Tess.
That' s the kids' table.
- Let me clear that for you.
- Wait, wait.
We didn' t -- We didn' t bet.
Is that a joke?
Yes.
- She' s drunk!
I, Reuben, take you, Lisa...
I, Reuben, take you, Lisa, to be my lawfully wedded wife.
I do.
I do.
Hey, Lois.
The room looks beautiful.
Oh, thanks.
Great.
Hey, did we sanitize these things?
Reuben!
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.!
- Sandy, you okay?
Jorgé, ice.
The best man went down.
Dance floor' s like a Slip 'N Slide, dude.
I thought I told them not to wax this.
Twenty- three percent of the guests are over 70.
Okay.
Don' t worry.
I' m gonna take care of it.
All right.
It' s my job to worry.
Okay, let me do the worrying 'cause you gotta get married.
I' m good.
You got my note that Harry Bard at table seven is violently allergic to seafood?
Yes.
His chicken will go nowhere near the fish.
We' re putting the finishing touches on the cake.
This looks great.
Lisa' s gonna love it.
Hit me, dude.
Hey, aren' t you that kid from Crocodile Tears?
That' s right.
I' m Sandy Lyle.
Man, I saw that movie in high school.
That bagpipe scene, that was the funniest shit, man.
We had a good time on that picture.
You want an autograph?
Ah, no, thanks.
It' s good to see you, man.
I thought you died, like, 15 years ago.
Ah.
I' m very much alive, my friend.
Getting back to my roots.
- Sandy, we should get going 'cause...
True Hollywood Story on me, so that should clear up a lot of your questions.
So they' re really doing one of those shows about your life?
Yeah.
I got a camera crew following me around the next few weeks.
It' s gonna be huge.
Wow.
That' s cool.
Reuben.
Lisa' s on her way down.
Okay, thanks.
Look, Reuben.
Yeah.
Now, I' m asking you this because you' re my oldest friend in the world.
And I' m your wingman.
Okay.
What?
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Sandy, there' s not a doubt in my mind.
Okay?
I found the perfect woman.
We' re totally in love.
My life' s working out just like I planned.
Let' s go get married.
Okay.
- Mazel tov.!
Go on.
Kiss each other.
Big smile, everyone!
You love each other.
Smile, Grandma.
Having fun. -??
[Screams]
Ohh!
Hello, everybody.
I' m Stan Indursky, Reuben' s boss.
Thank you.
You' re very kind.
Now, Reub' s not the sort of fellow to brag about his own success, so I' m going to do it for him.
The fact is, this young man here... is the best risk assessment expert... in this whole meshugas we call the insurance business.
Irving, Vivian, you' ve raised a wonderful son.
Let' s hear it for him.
Reuben, Lisa, let me just say... that I would insure your marriage any day of the week.
Mazel, you two.
Good things.
Mazel Tov!
Oh, and, Lisa, don' t tire him out too bad on the honeymoon.
- [Laughing]
- You know what, the truth is,
And about four and a half years ago, I met a real estate agent named Lisa Kramer,
Who showed me an apartment, which I rented just so she' d go out with me.
I gave him a good price.
Yeah, not good enough.
She' s a killer.
No, seriously, um...
After about a month of dating, I knew she was the one.
And I couldn' t be happier... that on this day that I' ve been dreaming about for so long, the woman I' m standing next to... is you.
Oh, my goodness.!
I lost my shoe!
Look at this place!
Oh, it' s so pretty!
It' s beautiful.
[Screams]
How' s your bruise?
It' s okay.
You know, it' s a little sore.
You know, they really should tell you if they' rejust gonna let komodo dragons run loose around the hotel.
Really.
Oh!
How about this one?
Let' s see.
"Recently renovated colonial in Montclair, three- bedroom."
Sweetie, remember?
We took a virtual tour of this one on the Internet.
It was perfect, but just a little pricey.
That' s right.
It' s probably off the market anyway.
Why do you say that?
'Cause I bought it.
You what?
I bought it!
[Both Laughing]
Reuben, I' m in shock.
I mean, you just... you don' t... you don' t do things like that.
You love it, right?
Yes, I do, but, Reuby...
We have a house!
Oh, my God, we have a house!
Honey!
- [Laughs]
Oh!
- [Chuckles]
Uh, it' s, uh, going great.
Thank you.
So I see you gang are new to the island.
I want to come have a meet with you, show you my boat.
That is my boat there on the sandbar.
- It' s very, uh, big.
- Yeah, it' s pretty good size.
It' s good size.
So, tell me true, are you guys for scuba?
What does that mean?
I' m like the unofficial scuba king of St. Barts, so if you are for scuba, I take you out on the boat,
I show you the coral reef, and we have kinda like a...
That sounds great, but we' re not certified, so we' re gonna have to pass.
That is no biggie.
I get you resort- certified couple of hour.
- Oh, I have always wanted to try it.
- Yeah?
Good.
My name is Claude.
What is, uh, you guys' name?
Uh, my name is Reuben.
This is my wife, Lisa.
"Leuban," I am here all afternoon.
All right, au revoir, Leuban, Lisa.
Solid.
Solid.
Hello.
How' s it going?
Leuban!
Lisa!
Hey.
Hi!
Hello.
Isn' t this exciting?
It is.
It' s fun.
You know what?
I think I' m gonna skip the scuba diving.
Reuben, no.
You called eight hotels.
They all said that this guy was the best.
I know, but you know how I am about boats, and I' m feeling a little queasy.
Oh, no.
Your stomach' s acting funny?
It' s okay now, but I think it might...
So why don' t you go?
We' re on our honeymoon.
I' m not gonna go without you.
No!
You' ve been wanting to try this.
I want you to go, okay?
It' il be fun.
I' il pick you up like at 4: 00, all right?
I love you.
I love you too.
Okay?
Okay.
You' re not for scuba, Leuban?
No, Claude.
- [Scoffs]
You have fun.
Can I talk to you for a second though?
- [No Audible Dialogue]
Hey, listen, this woman means more to me than anything else in the world, so be careful 'cause scuba can be very dangerous if the proper precautions aren' t taken.
Leuban, look to me in my eyeball.
I promise you I take care of Lisa as if she were my own flesh and blood.
Thank you.
Okay?
Okay.
Solid!
Solid.
Okay.
All right?
Are you ready?
Yeah, yeah.
Alley- oop.
Au revoir, Leuban.
Bye- bye, honey.!
I love you.!
I love you!?
Claude!?
Sojam by my side?
Hello.!?
We' rejammin '??
Lisa?
[Metal Clanging]
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Holy shit, Leuban!
This is not what it look like.
- You' re staying on the island with Claude?
- I' m a little confused right now, Reuben.
I think I need a little time just to figure things out.
What did you do to her?
Did you mess around with her oxygen tanks or something?
I did nothing, Leuban.
My name is not "Leuban"!
It is "Reuben"!
Look, we had a scuba, we talk about life, we drink some white wine.
We cannot help it.
It is like love at first sight.
She make like the fire in my trouser.
- What he' s trying to say, Reuben, is that we didn' t plan it.
Reuben, itjust... it happened.
It' s like the story of the hippo.
I' m not familiar with that story.
No way, José.
So he tried to paint the stripe on himself to be like the zebra, but he fool no one.
And then he tried to put the spot on his skin to be like the leopard, but everyone know he is a hippo.
So at certain point, he look himself in the mirror, and hejust say,
"Hey, I am a hippopotamus, and there is nothing I can do about it."
And as soon as he accepts this, he live life happy.
Happy as a hippo.
You understand?
- I' m gonna kill you!
- Reuben.!
No, Reuben.!
- Leuban, this is not the way!
You' re gonna be fine, Reuben.
No, I' m not gonna be fine.
I' m not gonna be fine at all.
- And don' t come back to me when you' ve changed your mind!
'Cause this ship has sailed.
Hey, Tina.
Hey, Mitch.
Hey, Reub.
- Cheryl.
- Hey.
Indursky and Sons, how may I help you?
What?
How does everyone know about this?
Your mother called Mr. Indursky and told him what happened.
I am so sorry, Reuben.
Thanks, Gladys.
Okay.
Thank you.
All right.
Okay.
Fuck.
Hey, there he is!
Hey.
Reub, come on in here.
I want to spitball something with you.
Can you give me a minute, Stan?
I' m just gonna run to the men' s room.
I' il join you.
I heard about your honeymoon.
Just terrible.
I knew that girl was a slut the second I met her.
Yeah, well, you know, it' s kind of complicated.
Hey, don' t make excuses.
She' s a dime- store hooker, and she always will be.
Just put it behind you.
Speaking of which, you ever hear of a guy named Leland Van Lew?
Um, Leland Van Lew.
Yeah, yeah.
Australian guy, right?
Um, was on the cover of Forbes last year?
[Farts]
Yeah, he started one of those high- tech, modem- scrotum,
God only knows what they do companies anyway.
Jesus Christ.
They want to take the company public, and if he wants to remain the C. E. O. Of a publicly held company, guess what he needs.
Life insurance.
Bingo was his name.
All right, you want me to check him out?
Yeah.
[Urinating Continues]
Yeah?
This Van Lew has a reputation as a cowboy.
Apparently, he' s one of these extreme sports nuts.
Might be a lot of dough in it for us, maybe a little extra bonus for you, help you with those house payments.
All right.
Well, let' s make sure he checks out first and...
You see?
This is why you' re the only one I can trust with these jobs.
I was worried that you' d been through hell and back with that whore wife of yours.
You sure you don' t need some more time off?
Mm- hmm.
I' m good.
Absolutely sure?
Yeah, no, I' m fine.
Yeah?
All right?
All right, good things.
Excuse me.
This is private property.
No, I know.
I just bought this house.
I move in next month.
Mr. Phifer, right?
Feffer.
Yeah, but you can just call me Reuben.
- Okay, then.
Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Thanks.
Sorry about your wife, Reuben.
First of all, I just want to say thank you to everybody for coming out, and this has just been an incredible day and night.
[Doorbell Rings]
To tell you the truth, I' ve been waiting for this day my entire life.
I' m so sorry, Reuben.
Oh.
Thanks.
Thanks, Sandy.
Whatever you need, I' m here for you, brother.
Thank you.
We' re rolling.
Hey!
Sound speed.
What the hell is this?
You remember Dustin and Vic.
True Hollywood Story on me.
- Right.
Sorry about your wife.
Sandy, do you want us over here?
Put it over by the table.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Is this better?
Oh, yeah, thanks.
Look, you can forget it.
I' m not going to a party.
What do you think is gonna happen?
Lisa' s gonna come waltzing through that door, saying she made a mistake?
No, of course not.
I' m just... -
I' m trying to make sense out of what the hell she did.
I mean, what can I say?
You' re my best friend.
Oh, oh!
You' re my partner.
You' re my wife.
Man, it feels good to say that.!
Ah, and, uh...
You' re my wife.
Man, it feels good to say that!
- What?
- Check out her expression.
She' s terrified.
- She' s smiling.
- I' m a student of acting, Reuben.
She' s faking it.
The woman got spooked.
She needed to explore, which is exactly what you' re gonna do.
You' ve been given the gift of freedom.
Don' t turn your back on that.
I don' t want freedom, Sandy!
I want to be married!
I bought a goddamn house!
I got to move out of this apartment in like six weeks!
- Look at her.
She' s not thinking about having a deep, committed relationship... with a complex individual like yourself.
She' s daydreaming about having hot, shallow sex with a French nudist.!
"Oh, I' m hugging.
Oh, I love you so much.
"Liar.!
So whose party is this again?
It' s an art opening for this Dutch guy, Jost.
His art sucks, but he used to sell me really good pot.
Oh, man, I' m so friggin 'horny.??
Look, just don' t leave me alone, okay?
I haven' t been to a party by myself in a long time.
Relax.
I' m your wingman.
I' il be right by your side the whole time.
So what do we do?
Do we, like, get a drink... or take a lap around the...
Sandy?
- More wine?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
- This party is so boring, and there are no cute guys here.
I haven' t noticed.
I' m appreciating the art.
I' m not looking for cute guys.
Oh, so you' ve sworn off men since you dumped your last boyfriend?
He was not my boyfriend.
We went out for like three days.
It was two months!
Really?
Yeah.
I hope he doesn' t have to buy that now.
Oh, my God!
I think I know that guy.
Reuben?
You' re Reuben Feffer, right?
Uh, yes.
I' m Polly...
Prince.
We went to junior high or middle school or whatever it' s called together.
You were next to me...
Polly Prince!
Yes!
No, it' s coming back to me now.
You left before high school.
Yeah, after seventh grade.
My mom and I, we moved to Michigan.
And now you live here in New York?
Yeah, moved here a few months ago.
Wow.
Friend of yours?
Yeah, that' s Roxanne.
She does that with, uh, bread, wine bottles and...
Anyway, uh, so what' s your deal?
You' ve got to be married with kids... and the whole thing.
I' m single.
Yeah, I haven' t taken the plunge.
- Oh.
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
Hey, Sandy, this is Polly Prince.
Remember?
From middle school?
Hey, how you doing?
Wow.
Okay.
Sandy Lyle.
Last time I saw you, you were playing bagpipes in that movie.
Croco Tears.
Yep, that' s me.
Polly, can I have a word with you?
Sorry.
Excuse us.
What happened to you?
Reuben, I' m in a situation here.
We have to leave now.
Can we stay a couple more minutes?
Dude, no.
This is serious.
I just sharted.
I don' t know what that means.
I tried to fart and a little shit came out.
I just sharted.
Now let' s go.
You' re the most disgusting person I' ve ever met in my life.
Mm- hmm.
Polly?
I' m sorry.
I got to go circulate.
[Chuckles]
So, Sandy, you' re good though?
You' re still acting?
I am.
It' s going incredibly well.
I' m actually headlining a new revival of Jesus Christ Superstar.
That' s great!
Yeah.
Well, it was really good seeing you guys.
Yeah, you too.
Okay.
See ya.
All right.
Bye, Polly.
- Be good.
- Bye.
More wine?
Polly Prince.
It' s funny, huh?
Seeing her.
Thank you.
She looks good.
Let it rain!
So I did a lot of thinking last night, and there' s something I' m pretty excited about.
What' s up?
Nice.
Let it rain!
I feel like I might be ready to move on.
You know, get my life back on track.
So, I am going to ask Polly Prince on a date.
Oh, that' s a mistake!
She' s not right for you, dude.
Rain dance!
Hey, you guys want to play some twos?
Actually, we' re kind of in the middle of a conversation, so...
What was that?
I' m just messing with you, sasquatch.
Let' s get it on.
Pick and roll!
Pick and roll!
Outlet!
Outlet!
Rain dance!
Sandy, come on.
Sandy!
Sandy!
Sandy!
Sandy!
White chocolate!
Raindrop!
Old school!
"T." "T."
Time- out.
I' m burning.
My lungs are burning.
So why do you think Polly' s so wrong for me?
You don' t even know this girl, Reuben.
You haven' t seen her since seventh grade.
How different could she be?
I mean, she was a senior delegate at the Model U. N.
She was in the chess club.
She was a "mathlete."
Her yearbook stats are really impressive.
Did you see the tattoo on her back?
Yeah.
So what?
Mathletes don' t wear body art like that.
Ball in!
I really feel like I ran into Polly for a reason.
Really.
I mean, I' m sorry if you don' t agree, Sandy, but I happen to believe in a little thing called destiny.
You guys ready?
You know what?
You think maybe you could put your shirt back on?
You guys ready to play?
Good shot.
Good shot.
Could I have the ball?
Hey, you know what?
Could we switch?
I' d rather not, dude.
I just found out how to cover this man right here, okay?
Come on, let' s play.
Yes, can I get the number for a Polly Prince, please?
Prince with a "P."
Okay, great.
And can I get the address as well?
Hello?
- [Ringing Continues]
[Answering Machine]
This is Reuben.
No!
I am unable to get to the phone right now, No!
But please leave a detailed message after the beep.
If you' re calling for...
Oh.?
Polly?
Gladys, I got to call you back.
Reuben?
Hey.!
Hi.
This is so funny.
I didn' t know you lived down here.
Yeah, yeah, I do.
Hey, do you live around here too?
Yeah.
No, I don' t.
I don' t live down here.
Did you call me last night?
Um, no, I don' t think so.
Are you sure?
'Cause I got a hang- up, so I did that star- 69 thingy, and I swore I got your answering machine.
Really?
You know, I heard that from a few people.
So maybe, I don' t know, the phone lines got crossed or something.
Oh, you doing some shopping?
Yeah.
I spent like 200 bucks on this loofah.
And it' s supposed to be like specially made in Sweden or something.
Wow.
So, yeah.
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
I' m not sure.
Okay.
Really?
I mean, not that I wouldn' t...
I' d like to.
I just...
I got to check my schedule.
All right, well, how about I' il give you my card.
Here you go.

It' s Reuben Feffer from Indursky and Sons calling for Mr. Van Lew.
Ah, right.
The insurance man.
I' m afraid Leland' s in the hospital.
I' m sorry?
Swimming with who?
Great white sharks.
But don' t worry.
[Phone Ringing]
Gladys!
He' s due in Los Angeles next week.
Should I set something up for then?
Okay, you know what, Deborah?
Could you hang on one second, please?
No worries.
Reuben Feffer.
Hi, Reuben.
It' s Polly Prince.
Oh, hey, Polly!
How' s it going?
Good.
I' m just calling to say that, um, I' m free tomorrow night if you want to get together.
Yeah, I would love to get together.
That' d be great.
Should I, um...
Should I pick a restaurant or...
Oh, no, no.
You know what?
I should probably just check my schedule, see if I can even do it.
Okay.
I' m...
Did you say you were free?
Yeah, no, I' m actually not sure.
But okay, I' il talk to you later.
Hello.
Hello, Polly?
What' s the buzz Tell me what' s a- happenin '??
Sandy.!
What?
I' m playing Jesus.
That' s my song.
I know it' s your song, but I felt something, and I decided to go with it.
But you' re playing Judas.
Judas.
All right, look.
I' m the star of the show, okay?
So if I decide to bust out a solo, do me a favor and give me the freedom to rock out.
So the play' s going well?
Yeah, I think it' s gonna be fun.
I mean, I just wish they wouldn' t surround me with a bunch of amateurs.
Isn' t that like the point of community theater?
Whatever, Reuben.
So I' m going on a date with Polly.
All right!
Where are you taking her?
I don' t know.
Some restaurant in the East Village.
She left the address on my machine.
How could you let Polly pick the restaurant?
Well, I had no choice.
She called me, like, seven times... to confirm and then cancel and then confirm again.
Why?
What' s wrong with letting her pick the place?
You' ve got irritable bowel syndrome, dude.
If she chose an ethnic restaurant, you' re gonna be running to the bathroom every five seconds.
Oh, my God.
You' re right.
Thank you.
You know, I doubt it' il get this far, but if she turns out to be easier than I thought, there' s something you need to know.
I' m not a virgin, Sandy.
No, not technically, but times have changed since you were last single.
Now, listen, when I' m making out with a girl for the first time,
What?
Nothing violent.
You just tap her real light right on the tushy and say,
"Hey, I' m your daddy.
I' m your daddy. "
Listen to me.
What are you doing?
I' m blotting the grease.
That' s the best part.
Let me see that.
Listen, don' t be shy.
- It' s just a little tap.
It' s like saying, "Boop, I' m your daddy."
- I' m not gonna tap her.
Brings' em right back to childhood.
Trust me, they' re putty in your hands after that.
Really.
I feel like this could be one of those... defining moments of my life or something, you know?
Yeah, I actually think it' s not gonna work out, but I' m pulling for you, Reub.
Just pray to God she doesn' t go ethnic.
The place didn' t sound ethnic.
Al Hafez.??
[Middle Eastern]
In the late '90s.
I bounced around to a bunch of different places over the past few years.
Oh, yeah?
Like where?
Oh, God, where?
Let' s see, Austin, Istanbul, Sri Lanka, Portland,
Costa Rica, Buffalo, a couple other places.
Were you in the Peace Corps?
No, I just like to move a lot.
I kinda get stir- crazy if I' m stuck in one place for too long, you know what I mean?
- [Both Laughing]
No, remember?
You were the person who broke...
Oh, my God!
I can' t believe you remember that.
Oh, of course.
You were like the greatest delegate in Model U. N. History.
I guess I did manage to pass a few resolutions.
Are you okay?
'Cause you' re sweating pretty profusely.
Yeah, no, I' m fine.
I always react this way to spicy food.
Okay.
Yeah, but I love it.
I can' t believe you' re not married.
I always saw you as that guy that would settle down at a young age, you know?
You were always kinda like an old young guy.
Yeah, well, it just hasn' t happened.
But, uh, what about you?
You ever gotten close or...
To the whole marriage thing?
Oh, God, no.
No way.
No, yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I' m not really big on the whole, um, long- term commitment thing.
Mm- hmm.
Why?
Are you coming out of a bad relationship or...
No, I' m kinda coming out of like eight bad relationships.
- Eight?
- You sure I can' t get you a towel or something?
I' m good.
But if the right person came along, things might be different, right?
Oh, yeah.
[Stomach Growling]
Sorry.
Um...
- Hey, you mind if I go to the men' s room?
- Please.
Occupied.
I' m gonna be here all night, dude.
All right, well, this is me.
Great.
Why don' t you come upstairs and, uh, I' il make you some coffee or tea.
Okay, great.
I just gotta find my keys here.
Oh, shoot.
- They' re right there, I hear 'em.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
It' s so cozy.
Thanks.
Did you just move in or...
Uh- huh.
- [Yelps]
Rat in the house!
- Oh, no, no.
This is Rodolfo.
He' s a ferret.
I got him in Sicily at a flea market years ago.
He' s old.
He can' t really see anymore.
Cute.
Hey, you mind if I use your bathroom?
Oh, sure, yeah.
Oh, actually, that' s not the bathroom.
- My bathroom' s right here.
Okay.
Yeah, 'cause I just, uh, had a lot to drink, a lot of water.
I' il just be a second.
[Door Closes]
Ohh!
[Small Fart]
Go away.
- [Squeaks]
Go!
Shoo!
Poo!
- Oh, God.
Oh, no.
Oh, God, I beg you, please.
If you make this water go down,
I will sit at your feet, and I will serve you for all of eternity.
I' il adopt a Somalian kid, or I' il work in Calcutta, or I' il...
Please, just make the water...
No!
- [Squeaking]
[Yelps]
This was fun.
Yes.
I would' ve never...
Oh, really, you know what, that' s okay.
Okay, well...
Good night, Polly.
Good night, Reuben.
Good night.
Oh, okay.
All right, okay.
All right.
That' s nice.
Okay, so...
Dude, why would you make number two in her apartment?
I mean, what should I have done???
[Woman Singing]
Tell her you' re tired and shag ass out of there.
Guys.
I called her to apologize.
What was that?
I called her to apologize.
But it doesn' t really matter 'cause I doubt she' il ever want to see me again.
I gotta call you back.
Cool.
[Elevator Dings]
Mr. Van Lew?
Feffer?
Yes.
Hi.
Reuben Feffer.
I recognized you from the Forbes cover.
You' re way early, sport.
Get in.
Is this the service elevator?
I don' t think we' il have a problem with this insurance business.
Sure, I take chances, but, hey, you can' t build a successful business without the occasional risk.
What I' m trying to determine are the kinds of risks you actually do take.
I only take the calculated ones.
Trust me, I plan on being round for ages yet.
Well, I know we' d really love to give you a policy if we can make it work.
We' il make it work, sport.
So, uh, what are we doing on the roof?
I' m just gonna do a bit of a BASE jump.
Here.
Keep the walkie on channel 13, all right?
I don' t know what you' re talking about.
A free- fall from an inanimate object.
I always carry me chute in case I find a good launching point.
Oh, no.
All right, look, just don' t do anything, all right?
Reuben Feffer.
Hey, Reuben, it' s Polly Prince.
How' s it going?
I' il give you a shout when I' m through, all right?
No!
No, that' s not all right.
Polly, can I call you back in a second?
I just wanted to tell you I got your message, and you know what?
Let' s just start over and forget about that whole loofah thing.
Holy shit!
No.!
Yahoo!
Oh!
Holy shit!
I didn' t like that loofah.
- [Screams]
Leland' s meeting with the insurance guy right now.
- Oh!
- Oh, crap!
Oh, shit!
I' il just call you in the next few days.
Bye!
Leland to Feffer, Leland to Feffer.
You there, mate?
Yes, Feffer to Leland, hello?
Come on down and give us a hand.
I think I might have fractured me coccyx.??
Oh, look at that.
You got me a new loofah.
Yeah, it' s from Finland, and the salesman said it has a very ergonomic design, so...
Oh, Reuben, that' s really... thank you... really sweet.
[Laughs]
I don' t believe this!
Oh, what are you doing here?
We' re having an early supper.
I wanted your father to try new cuisines.
Really?
It' s only 3: 00.
It' s a crime to beat the dinner crowds?
Who is this young woman?
This is Polly Prince.
Polly, these are my parents.
No!
Irving and Vivian Feffer.
Polly, it' s so good meeting you.
- How are you?
- I can' t believe you' re eating Indian.
You hate spicy food.
- [No Audible Dialogue]
Psst!
I' m gonna ask...
[Snaps Fingers]
I' m gonna ask this nice Native American man to get us a bigger table.
Mom, they' re Indian.
It' s okay.
Hi.
Need big table, please.
Four people.
Many thanks.
Okay.
Now, how do you kids know each other?
I told you.
Mom, we went to middle school together.
We were both delegates in the Model U. N.
Oh, you still work in government, honey?
No, no.
I' m a waitress.
- Mm.
- She' s also writing a children' s book.
Oh, very nice.
Reu, you' il never guess who I ran into yesterday.
Who' s that?
Lisa' s mother.
That' s good.
Hey, Dad, did you try this...
What is this stuff called?
- Sag.
- Sag.
Did you try this?
Apparently, Lisa' s doing wonderfully down there in St. Barts,
- selling villas, happy.
- That' s good for her.
- Now, who' s Lisa?
- Nah.
- Not important.
- Lisa' s Reuben' s wife.
Oh.
- She left him for another man on their honeymoon.
- Oh.
- Are we ready for the check?
I think I' il take the check.
- What?
Well, you know, your dad seems really nice.
Yes.
[Chuckles]
Yeah.
Hey, look, I just want you to know I was gonna tell you about Lisa.
I just, um...
I was embarrassed, and I...
I guess' cause I hadn' t seen you for so long and...
Oh, it' s so okay.
I understand.
No, I was an idiot.
I should' ve just told you the truth right from the start.
I' m not upset.
But when did this happen?
Two weeks ago.
Two weeks ago?
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?
[Scoffs]
I walked in on her, on Lisa, with, um, a scuba instructor on the first day of our honeymoon.
Anyway...
I mean...
Ohh!
Hey, Reuben!
Uh, it' s Polly...
Prince.
Um, I don' t know if you have any plans tonight, but if not, you should swing by, uh, 37 Gansevort Street... around 9: 00 if you can make it.
You know, it' s no big deal, but it could be fun.
So, you know, think about it.
Okay, so, um, I' il see you later... or not.
I mean either way.
Oh, if you do come, you should wear comfortable shoes.
That is if you come.
But you totally don' t have to.
I mean, I might not even be there.
Yeah.
I wore my comfortable shoes just like you said.
So what are we doing?
Oh, crap.
This place is a total secret.
It is the best underground salsa club in New York.
Yeah, you know, I' m not really a big dancer.
I don' t know...
Oh, come on.
You know what?
It' s easier than it looks.
Oh!
Oh, okay.
Just feel it in your legs.
All right.
Okay.
Ow!
Sorry, sorry.
Just step on my feet a little less than that.
Looking good, Pollyanna.
- [Javi Mumbling]
You stop that.
This is my friend Reuben.
- Hey.
- This is Javi.
Hey, you mind if I dance with the beautiful lady?
Yeah.
- All right, thanks, man.
Hey.
Hi!
I think I might take off.
Really?
Yeah.
Are you having a bad time?
No, no, no!
I' m just not into this whole dirty dancing thing.
What do you mean, dirty dancing?
I saw that movie.
I know that' s what you and that, uh, Spaniard were doing.
Wait a minute.
First of all, he' s Cuban, and that wasn' t dirty dancing, that was just salsa.
Okay, it' s just I' m just really, truthfully not the kind of guy... that' s ever gonna be into these kind of clubs or any...
Okay, Reuben, you know, then tell me, what kind of guy are ya?
What kind of guy am I?
What do you mean?
Well, up until now, you haven' t exactly been the portrait of honesty, so just come clean, okay?
Just tell me who you are.
I hate spicy food.
I knew it!
Yeah, I don' t like it at all.
I have a mild case of I. B. S. And...
What is that?
Irritable bowel syndrome.
What?
Irritable bowel syndrome.
Oh, God.
That' s terrible.
Um, what else?
I assess risk for a living, so I know that I have a. 013% chance... of being hit by a car on my way home, or a one in 46, 000 chance of falling through a subway grate.
Really?
So I try to manage that risk by avoiding danger... and having a plan and knowing what my next move is, and I guess you don' t exactly live your life that way.
I do it a little differently.
Yeah, which is great.
But I' m not gonna ever be a dirty dancer, and I don' t eat food with my hands, and I really like you, but I just don' t think this is gonna work out.
I just have to go pee.
Okay.
Oh.!
Funny.
- Hey.
- Hi.?
Ow!
Did you just spank me?
No!
I don' t...
No.
Mm- mmm.
Are you sure?
'Cause it felt like you just swatted me.
No, no, you...
I have a little crick in my wrist.
You just felt that little...
I was just...
Do you hear that?
Really?
Yeah.
You hear that?
Yeah.
[Mutters, Indistinct]
[Reuben Thinking]
This is incredible.
Oh, man.
Oh, God.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no!
No, no.
You can' t be done yet.
Come on, Reuben, focus.
You have to last at least five minutes here.
Four minutes, 27, 26, 25.
Two minutes 20, 19, 18, 17.
Come on.
You can do it.
55, 54, 53, 52, 51...
Oh, God!
Fifty!
Fifty?
Yeah, 50!
Whoo!
Let it rain.!
I tell ya, I think I might end up marrying this woman.
Really?
After one night?
Did you spank her?
Yeah, I tried, but I don' t think she liked it.
Yeah, some women find it offensive.
Iceman!
I did not sleep with him out of charity.
You weren' t interested till you found out his wife boned some other guy on their honeymoon.
That' s not it.
He is a kind, decent, solid guy.
I' ve never been with anybody like that.
Hi.
Thank you.
Do you have to use the word "bone" every time?
I use it when it' s appropriate.
Have you ever heard of a guy shouting out "50" when he orgasmed?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Okay, so throw pillows go in this cabinet here.
Oh, you don' t... you don' t sleep on these?
No, no, they' re... decorative.
- For who?
- What do you mean?
You' re the only one who sees them, but you don' t sleep on them.
Then you take them off the bed every night, put 'em in a box, take them out of the box.
I just don' t understand the point.
I don' t know.
I mean, Lisa thought they looked nice.
I see.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don' t see what the big deal is.
They make the bed look nice.
Hey!
What are you doing?
That' s goose down!
I' m liberating you.
Try it.
No!
I' m not gonna...
Just one stab.
Come on.
See how you feel.
Come on!
This is ridiculous.
It' s not ridiculous.
It' s not like driving a knife into a pillow is suddenly gonna make me feel...
That feels really good.
Right?
Yeah!
- What did I tell you?
- You know what?
You' re right.
Come on.
Bigger one.
What is the point of these things really?
They' re stupid.
Ha!
Ha!
I mean, what, am I running a bed- and- breakfast?
Not anymore.
I spend getting throw pillows on and off the bed?
How many?
Four minutes in the morning, four minutes at night.
That' s eight minutes of my life.
It' s 56 minutes a week.
That' s nearly two days of my life a year I spent putting pillows on and off a stupid bed!
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Oh, yeah.
[Sighs]
You know what?
I really gotta go.
I' m late.
[Reuben]
You lose your keys again?
No, they' re just not where I left them before.
Hey, why don' t you use that key finder I bought you?
Reuben, I don' t...
Need the stupid key finder!
All right.
Anyway, I was thinking I' d come meet you.
Really?
[Beeping]
No, it' s just salsa.
It' il be fun.
I' il watch.
Hey, what' s that noise?
Nothing.
It' s the key finder, isn' t it?
No, it' s so not the key finder.
Yes, it is!
It is not the key finder.
I' il see you later.
Bye.
How???
Hey, Reuby Tuesday.
¿Cómo estás?
Doin 'all right.
Actually, me no estás too good, Javier.
I want you to stay away from Polly, all right?
Find yourself another dance partner.
- Why?
- Why?
Because she and I are a couple, all right?
Yeah, we' re dating.
And I' m not gonna let some big shot salsa king... sweep in with your mambo moves and your Erik Estrada look... and come in and try to take her away, because I' ve had that happen before and it' s not gonna happen again.
- Reuben, I am gay.
- Hey, I don' t care what you...
What?
I' m homosexual.
My boyfriend Hector, he plays the keyboards in the house band.
Oh.
Hey, you think maybe you could give me some salsa lessons???
You hated it.
No, I don' t.
It' s very graphic for a children' s book.
You know, like this one:
"The Boy with a Nub for an Arm."
Well, that one has a moral.
You know, to teach kids they gotta be careful when they' re playing with fireworks.
Right.
Seriously.
Uh- huh.
I mean, like, you really convey... the pain and the fear, and I love the little doggy too.
But...
Right.
Just what were you thinking?
Which helps me finalize my recommendations.
BASE jumping.!
That is supposed to be so much fun.
That should be on the rewards side.
It' s one of the most dangerous activities a human being can do.
Really?
Have you done it?
No.
Uh- huh.
No?
No.
So how do you know what it' s like?
Huh.
Interesting.
Would you like some more bulgogi?
Sure.
Yeah?
Yeah, thanks.
I actually like this.
Yeah, it' s good.
You do?
How' s that shirt fit, all right?
Uh, yeah, it' s fine.
You know, I was thinking maybe we can just sit and talk.
I' m not really a big raquetball player.
No worries.
Have a few giggles.
So I' ve been running the numbers, and I gotta say... things aren' t looking too good from our end.
Bollocks!
Leland, I mean, it' s not just the BASE jumping.
Volcano luging, shark diving.
Bottom line is, unless you drastically alter your lifestyle, we won' t be able to insure you.
Reuben, I came to you for a reason.
I was told that you had more imagination... than any of the other blokes in the big firms... that you analyze the man and not just the numbers.
I guess I was wrong.
Are you trying to manipulate me?
Of course I am.
[Yells]
- Oh!
- I' il tell you what.
I' m gonna be in Nantucket at the end of the month.
You' il come up and be my guest aboard the 'Roo Shooter.
Aboard the what?
My sailboat.
I' il take you for a bit of a sail, give you a chance to really get to know me.
And I guarantee you by the end of the weekend, you' il know what a safe bet I really am.
Uh, you' re bleeding pretty bad.
Yeah, I think I' ve swallowed a tooth or something.
Got it.
[Chuckles]
Your serve.??
So I tell Leland we can' t insure him.
He responds by inviting me up to Nantucket for some Death Ray Sailing Challenge.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh, we gotta go do that.
I' ve never been to Nantucket.
You wanna come?
Well, can...
Is it all right if I invite myself?
No!
Okay, good.
So you' re actually gonna commit to something in advance.
Yeah...
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Okay, yeah, I am.
I think that would be really fun.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?
What are you doin '?
I' m- I' m gonna have some nuts.
You don' t eat mixed nuts at a bar.
Everybody knows that.
What are you talking about?
Let' s say, uh, conservatively, I don' t know, 17 people eat these nuts on a given night.
If they' ve been here for even two weeks, we' re talking about... 238 people who dipped their dirty hands into that bowl.
Dirty...
Why are their hands dirty?
On average, only one out of every six people wash their hands when they go to the bathroom.
Yeah, so when you think you' re innocently eating a little bar snack, you' re actually ingesting potentially deadly bacteria from about 39 soil- handed strangers.
I mean, people wonder why they get E. Coli poisoning or salmonella or hepatitis, when all they gotta do is look at the snack bowl at their local watering hole.
I' m not being neurotic.
No.
It' s an absolute hot zone in there.
How could you have eaten those?
L- l- l- I mean, I made such a compelling argument.
I like to live life on the edge.
Oh.
Thank you.
Yeah.
You never know.
Reuben, I mean, you don' t have to do this.
I don' t care that you... that you don' t know how to dance.
No, I thought I' d give it one last try.
Hey, Javi.
Hey, Reuben.
You ready?
Uh- huh.
What is happening?
- What are you doing?
Tzzz!
I don' t even know where that "yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi" thing came from.
It was just awesome.
Holy shit.!
What are you doing here?
I' m back.
Who' s this?
Who' s this?
What?
- You have a girlfriend?
- I' m not your girlfriend.
I mean, we' rejust kind of...
Hi, I' m Polly.
Right.
So, yeah.
You know, you guys probably have a lot to talk about.
So I' m just gonna go.
No, no, no, no, no.
I don' t want you to go.
That' s okay.
Please.
I wanna go.
Bye, Lisa.
I don' t...
I' m just gonna...
You gotta talk about it.
I' m just gonna go.
I thought you were really happy with Claude.
L- I was for a few weeks.
But then all he ever talked about was scuba diving.
- Really?
- I missed you.
I missed you too, but...
I mean, come on!
What was I supposed to do?
I moved on.
I' m in a relationship.
- What, with that Polly person?
- Yeah.
She doesn' t even call herself your girlfriend.
She...
She just doesn' t like the phrasing.
Okay.
Then let mejust ask you this.
Are you really gonna spend the rest of your life with her?
I don' t know, Lisa.
Because I' m ready to do that with you, Reuben.
I made a mistake and I took you for granted, but I promise you that I will never, ever hurt you again.
I love you, Reuben.
You know what?
I think, um...
'cause I gotta be out of here in a week.
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?
Where am I going?
I' m going into the house, remember?
The house that I bought for us to live in.
Well, then, let' s- let' s do it together.
Let' s go move into our house.
No, we can' t just go...
I can' t...
No.
I can' t...
I don' t even know what to say right now, okay?
Okay.
If you wanna get back together with her, just let me know.
No, I' m not planning on getting back together with her.
I wouldn' t be seeing you if I was planning...
It' s cool, you know?
You guys are married.
She came back.
All right, Polly...
How' s it coming with Herb Lazare, D. D. S.?
Hello?
I haven' t even gotten into it yet.
I' m- I' m still working on Van Lew.
I thought you decided on Van Lew two weeks ago.
We' re presenting to AFLAC on Wednesday.
Just hang on one second.
No, I kinda have to go.
You better not be bonus hunting on me, Reuben.
Bonus hunting?
Stan, the man' s career is on the line.
I owe it to him to give him a thorough analysis.
All right.
I' m going to Barbados with my mistress for the weekend.
I want this Van Lew thing settled by the time I get back.
All right?
I am on it, and I' m gonna make it happen.
Good things.
Good things.
Polly?
[Doorbell Rings]
Hey, pal.
Hey, Larry.
Lisa dropped this off for you.
Oh.
Thanks.
I met a real estate agent named Lisa Kramer... who showed me an apartment, which I rentedjust so she' d go out with me.
I gave him a good price.
Yeah, not good enough.
She' s a killer.!
[Continues, Indistinct]
Can we please just focus for a second?
I' m almost finished.
What' s next?
Polly' s career prospects.
Risky.
She' s writing a children' s book where kids get maimed.
'cause she' d have more time to spend with the kids.
You' re skewing the numbers in Polly' s favor, Reuben.
Why are we even doing this?
Because I' m confused, Sandy.
I mean, my goddamn wife shows up on my doorstep... wanting to get back together, Polly' s freaking out.
I just wanna make sure I' m making the right decision.
I don' t see how putting these two girls in the Riskmaster' s gonna help you make up your mind.
Interesting.
What' s it say?
Polly.
Polly?
Yeah.
No way.
You should just cut your losses and get back with Lisa.
Nah, I checked it, like, three times.
Whatever.
By the way, dude, is your health okay?
I mean, you' re looking kind of thin.
Polly' s been making me eat ethnic food, so I' ve been throwing up a lot lately.
Cool.
Polly Prince.
Polly Feffer.
Polly Prince- Feffer.
Come on.
I thought you were so excited to go.
I know, but...
Polly.
Hello?
- Hold on.
- So we had our designer use a similar color palette in here.
Hi.
I' m sorry.
I' m on the phone.
Would you just please keep it...
Shh.
So, also, you know what else?
It' s like I feel weird going away for the weekend when your wife' s just come back into town.
I don' t know why you' re making this into such a big deal.
I told you I' m not getting back together with her.
Okay.
So are you coming or not?
I' m coming.
All right.
Okay?
Bye.
Okay, bye.
You' re pretty good at it.
You' re a natural.
This is amazing.!
Hey, Leland!
Are those storm clouds up ahead?
Nah.
We might just get a light dusting, that' s all.
Nothing to write home about.
Are you sure you' re all right?
[Reuben]
Oh, no, I' m okay.
I don' t think I have my sea legs yet.
I' il be out in a sec.
All right.
Oh, God.??
So I know we haven' t been seeing each other that long, but I really feel like it' s time we take things to the next level, and I' d like you to consider moving in with me.
Why don' t we just move in together?
Oh, yeah.
We' re gonna have ourselves a tussle.
Hey, Polly!
Rodolfo' s in your toiletry kit.!
Did you know that?
Did you pack him, or did you... did you...
What- What is this?
I mean, why am I in your computer... on your Riskmaster thingy and...
Okay, you know what?
I can explain this, Polly.
Well, no, it' s fascinating.
I learned a lot about myself.
I' ve learned that I have no career, I' m flaky, I like ethnic food.
Uh- huh.
Lisa came back, and I, you know, I' ve been trying to figure things out.
What are you figuring out, Reuben?
Just about us and our future.
Future?
What are you talking about?
What future?
Reuben, come on!
Come on.
What, did you think we were gonna get married?
Maybe...
I was gonna ask you to move in with me first.
You expect me to move to the suburbs with you?
Reuben, are you insane?
Why is that so crazy?
People do that all the time.
You know what, though?
You do that, right?
That' s what you do.
I don' t live my life that way.
Is your lack of a plan that different than my plan?
I don' t have a plan.
Yes, you do!
You' re on the non- plan plan.
I am not on a non- plan plan!
I' ve never met anybody more afraid of committing to anything.
I mean, you were a senior delegate at the Model U. N., Polly.
[Leland]
Come on, you mother!
You can do better than that!
I' ve been living my life, okay?
I' ve been in good relationships and I' ve been in shitty ones, and I' ve moved a lot, and I' ve been happy and I' ve been sad, and I' ve been lonely, and that' s what I' ve been doing, which is a lot more than I can say for some freak who thinks... he' s gonna get the Ebola virus from a bowl of mixed nuts.
Those nuts have pee on them!
It' s common sense!
Oh, trust me, that is so far beyond common sense, Reuben.
You don' t understand what I grew up with.
I had a mother who made me afraid of everything.
Okay, well, big deal, Reuben.
My dad had a whole second family.
- What?
- Yeah, on Long Island.
A wife and kids and a golden retriever.
A second family?
Whatever.
Hey, you know what?
I' m, uh, glad I saw that.
I am.
'Cause you know what?
I' m gonna make this really, uh, easy for you, Reuben.
I have no interest... in getting married and moving to the suburbs.
And, obviously, that' s something that' s really important to you.
So here' s what I think your new plan should be.
I think you should get back together with Lisa, move into your house, and move on with your life.
And- And, uh, I think you guys will be really happy together.
Whoa!
You' re not making myjob any easier, Leland.
Ah, come on, Reub.
Weather report said sunny skies.
Hey, it' s Polly...
Prince.
Leave me a message, or call back, or not.
Okay, bye.
[Beeps]
Hey, Polly, it' s me.
I would like to talk to you, all right?
'Cause I feel really bad about what happened, and...
Just give me a call on my cell phone, all right?
Hello?
It' s Lisa.
Oh.
Hey.
So, how' s the house?
The house is, uh... it' s great.
Yeah, it' s big, but, you know, great.
Well, I can' t wait to see it.
Hey, did you get the gift I sent you?
Yeah, I did.
Thanks.
I really wanna see you, Reuben.
I don' t know, Lisa.
Fighting for a lost cause??
The premiere ofJesus Christ Superstar is about to begin.
Hey!
Reuby Tuesday.!
Hey!
Javi!
¿Cómo estás?
What are you doin 'here?
What else?
Hector' s playin 'keyboards in the band.
I didn' t figure you a fan of musical theater.
No, my friend Sandy Lyle is in the show.
Hey, have you, um... have you talked to Polly?
She was upset, bro.
Must' ve been some kind of fight, huh?
Yeah.
I keep calling her up, and she won' t pick up the phone.
I don' t know, I was thinking about maybe dropping by tomorrow.
It' s a bit too late, papi.
She' s leaving town in about two hours.
What?
W- Why?
Where is she going?
I don' t know.
She said good- bye.
That' s it.
Hi.
I' m sorry I' m late.
Hey.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
Hey, Javi, this is Lisa, my... wife.
Hey.
Oh.
Her mother told me she was back.
You' re doing the right thing here, Reub.
Relax, Mom.
I' m not promising anything.
It' s very exciting.
Reuben Feffer.
Reuben, Stan.
Change of plan.
The meeting with Van Lew' s board and the AFLAC people' s moved to 4: 00.
4: 00?
I don' t know if I can do that.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Get your ass over here!
Good evening, folks.
Uh, I' m Sandy Lyle, and I' ve got a very special announcement.
In addition to playing the role ofJudas,
[Man]
Sandy, what are you doing?
Wonsuk is playing Jesus.
It' s cool.
I' m playing dual roles.
[Wonsuk]
Screw you, Sandy.!
You' re a has- been.
No one even cares you were in that stupid movie.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, shit!
Aah!
Judas is biting me.!
What just happened in there?
I am a professional, Reuben, and I' m not gonna put my reputation on the line for a group of freaking amateurs.
It' s always the same story with you, huh, pal?
You did this one movie a hundred years ago.
From then on, you thought you were better than everybody else.
Why don' t you let go?
Move on with your life.
It' s not about what happened in the past... or what you think might happen in the future.
It' s about the ride, for Christ' s sake.
There' s no point going through all this crap... if you' re not gonna enjoy the ride.
And you know what?
When you least expect it, something great might come along... something better than you even planned for.
You were funny as hell playing those bagpipes, though.
Did I ever tell you that?
L- I don' t think I' ve ever heard you speak before, Mr. Feffer.
So, Reuby, we' re gonna grab a bite after your work thingamajigy?
No, Lisa.
I shouldn' t have asked you to come down here.
I' m not getting back together with you.
What are you talking about?
Why?
You screwed a scuba diving instructor on our honeymoon.
I mean, what kind of cold, heartless bitch... would do that to someone they love?
I' d have to be an idiot to get back together with you after that.
Oh, and by the way, I destroyed all your little throw pillows.
Yeah, because throw pillows suck, okay?
They serve no purpose.
They' re purely decorative.
Dude, that was incredible.
You' re the one who told me I should get back together with her.
Reuben.
Whatever you do, don' t ever take my advice again.
Your dad totally put it in perspective for me.
I was barely famous back then, and I' m never gonna be famous again.
True Hollywood Story?
Channel doesn' t even know we' re making this show.
What do you mean?
I hired Dustin and Vic myself.
And I was gonna try and sell it to the network when I' m done.
True Hollywood Story on yourself?
Sandy, that' s so...
That' s the stupidest thing I' ve ever heard.
I know.
I' m such a loser.
Look, I need you to do something for me that' s really, really important.
So you gotta promise me just this one time you won' t screw it up.
Reuben, I' m your wingman.
Whatever it is, I will not let you down.
Your Reuben' s proxy?
What the hell does that mean?
Now, he' s dealing with a personal situation, so he asked me to fill in.
Now, you gotta relax.
I' m a professional actor, and these dudes will never know the difference.
I can' t freaking believe this is happening.
Be quiet, 'cause I' m... tryin' to prepare.
I' m gonna vomit.
I am so sorry for the delay, folks, but one of our senior analysts, Reuben Feffer, had his spleen burst just a few moments ago, and...
That' s not good.
Is he gonna be all right?
Well, God willing, Leland.
But anyway, be that as it may, we have Mr. Feffer' s associate here, Mr. Sanford Lyle, who' s been briefed on the case and will present Reuben' s recommendations.
Thank you, Stanley.
I just need a little bit of water.
As you know, this is a highly complex case.
Um, let me see here.
Yeah, on the plus side,
Leland' s blood pressure is pretty solid.
And he' s, uh, at a decent weight, and he looks pretty damn healthy, right?
And he' s a sexy guy, right?
And he is sexually active in the community.
- Polly?
- J. F. K., please.
Let' s not bullcrap each other.
On paper, Van Lew is one of the riskiest sons ofbitches alive.
But, people, we cannot sum up a man' s life with a bunch of numbers on a computer screen.
All right, we all need to look into our hearts and go,
"Do I think this dude is gonna die in a few years or not?"
Is old Leland here gonna fight off a man... with the last name "Reaper," first name... who goes by the last name "Reaper," first name "Grim"?
Or will this BASE- jumping, crocodile- wrestling, shark- diving, volcano- luging, bear- fighting, snake- wrangling, motocross- racing bastard die?
And the answer is no, friends, which is why myself,
Reuben Feffer, Stan... and all of us here at Indurby and Friends... are willing to lay our asses on the line... and proudly recommend that Leland Van Lew... receive fifty million dollars in life and health... and automobile insurance... for a duration of no less than 20 years.
Hey, what do you think, guys?
Are you that kid from Crocodile Tears?
You' re goddamn right I am.
I thought so.
Impressive presentation.
He' s insured.
Yeah!
Bloody ripper!
Congratulations.
Love ya, son.!
Rodolfo, wait.!
[Beeping Intensifies]
Reuben, it' s too late.
I have to be on a plane in, like, 45 minutes.
I don' t think you really wanna leave here.
You have no idea what I want.
You left Rodolfo behind.
Does that mean anything to you?
Look, I made a mistake, all right?
I should' ve never put you in the Riskmaster.
Truth is, no matter what happened on our honeymoon, you' re much riskier than Lisa could ever be.
Right.
That' s why it' s not gonna work out between us.
Reuben, you are a nice, safe, conventional guy.
It' s not gonna work out.
I don' t think that' s who I really am.
It is, Reuben.
That' s okay.
Huh?
Hey!
Huh?
What are you...
Oh, my God.
Hey, look.
Look, I' m eating nuts.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Those nuts aren' t even dirty.
Since we' ve been together, I' ve felt more uncomfortable, out of place, embarrassed... and just physically sick than I have in my entire life.
But I couldn' t have gone through all that...
I couldn' t have thrown up 19 times in 48 days... if I wasn' t in love with you.
Maybe you were right.
Maybe this is just a fling.
But if you get on that plane and you go to Cincinnati... or Tanzania or wherever you' re going, we' il never know if it could' ve been something more.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
No.
Oh, no.
N- No.
- Oh, Reuben.
- Please don' t eat those.
No, really.
Oh, God.
I don' t want you to go away, Polly.
I' m not gonna marry you, Reuben.
I don' t wanna get married.
I just wanna take you to dinner... sometime this week.
Can I pick the place?
Solid.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Hello.
I see you two are new to the island.
I want to come have a meet...
Oh, my stars and stripe.
Leuban!
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe it is you.
This is Polly.
Hi, Polly.
I am Claude.
Hi.
So how' s it goin '?
In truth, uh, it has been a little bit tough noogies for me.
Lisa, she... she broke my heart.
- I' m sorry to hear that.
- Ah.
That is life, huh?
Well, you have to be like the hippo.
Exactly.
Like the hippo.
So, let me guess.
You are here on honeymoon again?
This is your beautiful bride?
We' re just, uh...
We' re just hangin 'out.
Oh, come on.
It' s a little more serious than that.
Well, yeah.
Right.
- No, definitely not married.
But it' s possible.
- It is possible.
We' re takin' things step by step, seein' how they work out.
Okay, I don' t really understand what you are talking about, but, uh, any chance you are for scuba today?
Actually, we are for scuba.
- No way, Jose!
- Yes way, Jose!
But we' re goin 'out with that guy.
Hey, Leland.!
We' il be out there in a minute.!
As long as you are for scuba, Leuban, I am happy.
Oh.
Sweet.
So, au revoir, my good friend.
Okay.
Hey.
Thank you for everything, Claude.
It' s good to see you again.
Good- bye, Polly.
Good- bye.
Nice to meet you, Claude.
You as well.
So you ready?
Let' s do it.?
There was a time, a time before cable, when the local anchorman reigned supreme,
when people believed everything they heard on TV.
This was an age when only men were allowed to read the news.
And in San Diego, one anchorman was more man than the rest.
His name was Ron Burgundy.
He was like a god walking amongst mere mortals.
He had a voice that could make a wolverine purr, and suits so fine they made Sinatra look like a hobo.
In other words, Ron Burgundy was the balls.
I look good.
I mean, really good.
Hey, everyone!
Come and see how good I look!
Mm, ehh, mm.
I had ribs for lunch.
That' s why I' m doing this.
How now brown cow.
How now brown cow.
How now brown cow.
How are you?
Hmm?
Maybe don' t wear a bra next time.
No, I was talking to you.
No, not her.
I don' t know her name.
What is it?
Lanolin?
La- lanolin?
Like sheep' s wool?
Unique New York.
Mm, I love Scotch.
I love Scotch.
Scotchy, Scotch, Scotch.
Here it goes down.
Mm- mm- mm.
The arsonist has oddly shaped feet.
How much time?
30?
30 seconds?
- You are on.
- I' m on right now?
I don' t believe you. - # Doo doo doo. # - Ron!
Oh, come on.
Audrey.
I look like hell.
I got bags under my eyes.
What' s that?
I' d punch you right in the mouth.
That' s bush.
Bush league.
The human torch was denied a bank loan.
You hear me?
Audrey, look at me!
I' m sorry.
All right?
I' m sorry.
All right, we' re on.
Ready, Phil.
We' re on in five, four...
Narrator:
When the clock struck 6: 00, it meant one thing for Ron Burgundy and his news team:
Go time.
Announcer:
Ron Burgundy.
Champ Kind, sports.
Brick Tamland, weather.
And your reporter in the field, Brian Fantana.
It' s Channel 4 News at 6: 00.
Good evening.
I' m Ron Burgundy, and this is what' s happening in your world tonight.
A La Jolla man clings to life at a university hospital after being viciously attacked by a pack of wild dogs in an abandoned pool.
Hey, everybody!
Shut the hell up!
Ron Burgundy' s on!
Authorities are still uncertain as to why the man
- was loitering...
- Ron Burgundy.
Oh, my gosh!
She said her first words!
Right now it' s 82° in our fair city, and compare that to 48° in the upper Northwest and 38° in the Middle East.
Off the coast of Tampa Bay yesterday, one lucky cameraman happened to catch an unusual aquatic daredevil.
What you' re about to see is a Channel 4 News exclusive.
His name is Nutty the Squirrel, and he' s three years old.
How 'bout that?
That squirrel can water- ski.
- Man, that' s hilarious.
- Yeah, that' s good.
For all of us here at News Center 4,
I' m Ron Burgundy.
You stay classy, San Diego.
You stay classy, San Diego.
Listen up.
The ratings just came in for last month.
We are number one.
We just grabbed every key demographic.
- Super- duper, gang!
- Yeah!
Yeah!
Super- duper!
That' s nice!
Way to go!
Neat- o, gang.
- Yes!
- Boy, Ed.
That is good news.
I gotta be honest.
- Congrats, congrats.
- That is good news!
- All right!
- Stick around.
Make sure these guys don' t party too much.
- They don' t really ever listen to me.
- Just get it done.
Ladies and gentlemen, can I please have your attention?
I' ve just been handed an urgent and horrifying news story.
I need all of you to stop what you' re doing and listen.
Cannonball!
Yes, these fellas were a real news team.
Burgundy, of course, was the foundation, the rock.
But each member brought their own special something to the equation.
People call me the Bri- man.
I' m the stylish one of the group.
I know what you' re asking yourself, and the answer is yes, I have a nickname for my penis.
It' s called the Octagon.
But I also nicknamed my testes.
My left one is James Westfall, and my right one is Dr. Kenneth Noisewater.
You ladies play your cards right, you might get to meet the whole gang.
Bang, boom, they were showing lasers every Friday night.
Champ here.
I' m all about havin 'fun.
You know, get a couple of cocktails in me, start a fire in someone' s kitchen.
Maybe go to SeaWorld, take my pants off.
Anyway, I' ve become kind of famous for my signature catchphrase, "Whammy!"
As in, "Gene Tenace at the plate... and whammy!"
Whammy!
I' m Brick Tamland.
People seem to like me because I am polite and I' m rarely late.
I like to eat ice cream, and I really enjoy a nice pair of slacks.
Years later, a doctor will tell me that I have an IQ of 48 and am what some people call
"mentally retarded."
Hello!
Marco!
- Polo!
- Brian.
- You having a good time?
- I' m having a great time.
- That makes two of us.
You' ve gotta meet this girl.
She used to be a Charger cheerleader, but she broke her pelvis.
Sherri, meet Ron Burgundy.
- Hey, Ron.
- Hello.
- Mm- hmm.
And it' s right here.
Well, hello.
You pointed to your boobies.
Oh, my God, you did!
- Ron Burgundy?
- Yes?
I have had a crush on you since I was a little girl.
Let' s go somewhere.
I' m telling you, it don' t get no better than this.
We' ve been coming to the same party for 12 years, and in no way is that depressing.
By the beard of Zeus!
Excuse me.
Ron, where you going?
What, are you crazy?
Ron!
If you' re coming down the baseline, you gotta take home plate from me!
So there I go, head first, boom!
I' ve lost her.
Hello.
Hello.
Hope I' m not disturbing you, but, uh,
I don' t usually do this, but I felt compelled to tell you something.
You have... an absolutely breathtaking... heinie.
I mean, that thing is good.
I want to be friends with it.
Well, you certainly know how to compliment a woman.
Now, if you' il excuse me.
Do you know who I am?
No, I can' t say that I do.
I don' t know how to put this, but I' m kind of a big deal.
Really?
People know me.
I' ve very happy for you.
I' m very important.
I have... many leather- bound books, and my apartment smells of rich mahogany.
I' m friends with Merlin Olsen, too.
He comes over on occasion.
That' s stupid.
No, no, that' s... very exciting.
Listen, can I... can I start over again?
Sure.
I wanna say something.
I' m gonna put it out there.
If you like it, you can take it.
If you don' t, send it right back.
I wanna be on you.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I...
I wanna be on you.
Baxter!
Papa' s home.
There he is.
There' s my little man.
- You' re okay?
Of course I met a lady tonight.
This one was different.
I have to be honest.
Quite different.
- What...
I' m lonely?
I' m not lonely!
I' m beloved by everyone in San Diego.
You know how to cut to the core of me, Baxter.
- You' re so wise.
You' re like a miniature Buddha covered in hair.
- Come again?
You know I don' t speak Spanish.
In English, please.
- You pooped in the refrigerator?
- And you ate a whole wheel of cheese?
How' d you do that?
I' m not even mad.
That' s amazing.
I forgive you.
What do you say we get you in your pj' s and hit the hay?
Bedtime.
Okay, come on.
Let' s go.
Come on.
Oh, that was one crazy party.
I am hung over.
Tell me about it.
I woke up this morning and I shit a squirrel.
I mean it.
Literally.
Hell of it is, damn thing' s still alive.
So I got this shit- covered squirrel down there in the office.
Don' t know what to name it.
I' m sorry, Champ.
I think I ate your chocolate squirrel.
All right, guys.
Morning, everyone.
Here are the stories we' re going to be chasing today.
It looks like Ling Wong, the rare panda at the San Diego Zoo, is pregnant.
This is a big one.
This could be the big story of the summer.
Network is gonna be wanting plenty of coverage.
And speaking of network, word on the street is they' re looking for a new anchor.
- So, Ron...
Network?
Are they here?
A lot of you have been hearing the affiliates complaining about a lack of diversity on the news team.
What in the hell' s diversity?
Well, I could be wrong, but I believe diversity is an old, old wooden ship that was used during the Civil War era.
I would be surprised if the affiliates were concerned about the lack of an old wooden ship, but nice try.
Diversity means that times are changing, and with that in mind...
- Ron, are you paying attention?
- Nope.
- This concerns all of us.
- Okay.
Keeping that in mind, I' d like to introduce the latest addition to the KVWN News Team, directly from WYPN in Asheville, North Carolina,
Ms. Veronica Corningstone. - # Who' s that lady? # - Hello. - # Who' s that lady... # - Hello, everyone.
- I just want you all to know that I look forward to contributing to this news station' s already sterling reputation.
I mean, come on, Ed!
It' s bullcrap!
Don' t get me wrong.
I love the ladies.
They rev my engine, but they don' t belong in the newsroom!
It is anchorman, not anchorlady!
- Uh- huh.
I don' t know what we' re yelling about!
Ron, what do you think?
She... sh... it' s terrible!
She has beautiful eyes, and her hair smells like cinnamon!
Loud noises!
All right, everyone relax.
She' s not gonna take anyone' s airtime.
I read somewhere that their periods attract bears.
Bears can smell the menstruation.
Well, that' s just great.
You hear that, Ed?
Bears.
Now you' re putting the whole station in jeopardy.
I will say one thing for her, Ed, she does have a nice, big old behind.
I' d like to put some barbecue sauce on that butt and just bite, bite, bite, bite, munch, munch, munch!
- Stop it!
Oh, Jeez.
Look at the full- moon butt!
Champ!
Champ!
Champ, Champ!
Mr. Harken, I was just wondering if you knew when my office would be ready.
Well, that might take some time.
For now, why don' t you just grab a desk in the bullpen?
You can use my office!
Then afterwards maybe we can go to lunch!
Lower your voice, Ron.
All right.
Thank you, Mr. Harken.
I' il go get my desk set up.
Oh, she is a saucy mama!
I mean, I would...
Here we go again.
Every station it' s the same.
Women ask me how I put up with it.
Well, the truth is, I don' t really have a choice.
This is definitely a man' s world.
I' m chasing down leads and practicing my nonregional diction.
Because the only way to win is to be the best.
The very best.
Touchy situation.
I think the best thing to do with this Corningstone, to keep her in line, is bed her quick.
Oh, that behind is driving me loco!
I' m like a night wolf.
Guys, take it easy.
Just take it easy!
- She' s got feelings, too.
- Oh, my God!
Listen to Burgundy.
He' s gone soft on us, like some schoolboy bitch.
You sound like a gay.
Come on!
It' s me, Papa Burgundy, all right?
As far as I' m concerned, Corningstone' s fair game.
Let the games begin!
There he is.
There he is.
I' m very aroused.
What' s this?
Well, well, well.
Ron Burgundy and the Channel 4 News Team.
Hello, Wes Mantooth.
Hello, Evening News Team.
Nice clothes, gentlemen.
I didn' t know the Salvation Army was having a sale.
Am I right?
Look at these guys.
Hey, where did you get those clothes?
At the toilet store?
What are you doing on our station' s turf, Burgundy?
You' re about to get a serious beat- down.
I will smash your face into a car windshield and then take your mother, Dorothy Mantooth, out for a nice seafood dinner and never call her again!
Dorothy Mantooth is a saint!
You understand me?
- Dorothy Mantooth is a saint!
- Hey.
Leave the mothers out of this, all right?
It' s unnecessary.
Besides, I' m sure Wes here is just upset over finishing second in the ratings again.
That' s completely uncalled for, Burgundy.
You know those rating systems are flawed.
They don' t take into account houses that have more than two television sets and other things of that nature.
I guess I have to take you at your word,
Number Two.
You have a great day, fellas.
We' il see you around the bend.
Son of a bitch!
Excusez- moi, Numero Two.
Hey, Burgundy.
You know those sample audiences aren' t big enough!
Stop hiding behind those phony numbers, Burgundy!
I' m coming after you!
I hate you, Ron Burgundy.
I hate you!
You can' t say one word?
Even the guy who can' t think says something!
You guys just stand there?
Come on!
Right, but I think my son is just going through a phase.
I have no idea where he would have gotten ahold of German pornography.
But you and I are mature adults.
We' ve both seen our share of pornographic materials.
Oh, you never have?
Of course you haven' t, how stupid of me.
Neither have I.
I was just speaking in generalities.
I' il stop by the school a little later, Sister Margaret.
Ed, she insisted on coming in.
Mr. Harken, sir,
I will not have my first story at this news station be about a cat fashion show.
Miss Corningstone, ma' am, you will do the stories to which you are assigned.
Mr. Harken, I am a damn good journalist, and this cat show thing is grade- A baloney.
It is not baloney.
Now, go do your job, missy!
It is baloney!
I' m gonna take a run at the new girl.
Let the games begin.
Oh, Champ, Champ, we' re not really gonna actually do that.
- We were just flapping our gums.
- Oh, yeah.
You kill me, Burgundy.
Let me just grab this.
Oh, sorry about that.
- Hmm.
- Uh, Champ?
- Yeah.
You' re trying to touch my breasts, aren' t you?
What can I say?
I like the way you' re put together.
What do you say we go out on a date?
Have some chicken, maybe some sex.
You know, see what happens?
Oh, let me get this over here.
- Sorry.
Oh, there it is.
I' il give this little cookie an hour before we' re doing the no- pants dance.
- Time to musk up.
It never ceases to amaze me.
What cologne you gonna go with?
London Gentleman, or... wait.
No, no, no.
Hold on.
Blackbeard' s Delight.
No, she gets a special cologne.
It' s called Sex Panther by Odeon.
- It' s illegal in nine countries.
Yep, it' s made with bits of real panther.
- So you know it' s good.
- It' s quite pungent.
Oh yeah.
It' s a formidable scent.
It stings the nostrils.
- In a good way.
- Yep.
I' il be honest with you.
That smells like pure gasoline.
They' ve done studies, you know.
60% of the time, it works every time.
That doesn' t make sense.
Well...
let' s go see if we can make this little kitty purr.
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Got an invite I' d like to extend your way.
My God.
What is that smell?
That' s the smell of desire, milady.
like a used diaper filled with Indian food.
Excuse me.
Desire smells like that to some people.
What is that?
Smells like a turd covered in burnt hair!
It smells like Bigfoot' s dick!
Oh, hell, that' s rank!
Oh, what' s that smell?
This is worse than the time the raccoon got in the copier.
Yeah.
It' s very distracting.
- Cough!
Look over here.
Excuse me, Veronica.
Yes, what is it, Brick?
I would like to extend to you an invitation to the pants party.
Excuse me?
The party.
The pants...
With the pants.
Party with pants?
Brick, are you saying that there' s a party in your pants and I' m invited?
That' s it.
Did Brian tell you to say this, Brick?
No... yes, he did.
Okay.
No, I don' t want to go to a party in your pants.
Very well.
Ian?
Would you like to go to a party in my pants?
No, Brick.
All right.
Let' s go!
- All right, now...
I' m telling you, she is a real ball- buster.
A real ice queen.
I just burned my tongue.
The only way to bag a classy lady is to give her two tickets to the gun show...
and see if she likes the goods.
1, 001.
1, 002.
- Uh, Mr. Burgundy?
- 1, 003.
Helen said that you needed to see me?
Oh, Miss Corningstone.
I wasn' t expecting company.
Just doing my workout.
Tuesday' s arms and back.
- You asked me to come by, sir.
- Oh, did I?
Yes.
Oh, it' s the deep burn!
Oh, it' s so deep.
I can barely lift my right arm 'cause I did so many.
I don' t know if you heard me counting.
I did over 1, 000.
You have your ubulus muscle that connects to the upper dorsinus.
It' s boring, but it' s part of my life.
I' m just gonna grab this shirt, if you don' t mind.
Just watch out for the guns.
They' il get you.
You are pathetic.
This has to be the feeblest pickup attempt that I have ever encountered.
I expected it from the rest of them, Mr. Burgundy, but not from you.
Wait a minute!
I... pickup attempt?
I' m offended.
I have little time to get to the gym, so I have to sculpt my guns at the office.
Oh, stop calling your arms "guns."
Look.
My plan was to ask you if I could squire you about town as one professional helping another professional, because I know what it' s like to be lonely in a new city.
- Really?
- Yes.
But now I am too hurt.
And shocked and offended and... and hurt.
I could do that.
Really?
Well, yes.
As a journalist, I should get to know the city that I' m covering.
- But this is not a date.
- No, of course not.
- Strictly professional.
- Wonderful.
- Great.
Shall I pick you up 8: 00?
Mm, 9: 00.
Downstairs?
Mr. Burgundy, you have a massive erection.
Really?
Um...
- Mm.
It' s actually an optical illusion.
It' s the pattern on the pants.
It' s not flattering in the crotchal region.
I' m actually taking them back right now.
Taking them back to the pants store.
Oh, this is awkward.
I' m gonna walk...
I' m gonna walk this situation off and I will see you later.
Nothing to look at.
Go back to work, everyone.
Don' t act like you' re not impressed.
Don' t look at me right now.
I' m walking around the office.
My new walk.
I have a situation right now I' m trying to walk off.
Frame up two.
- Let' s go to Brian Fantana live...
- Gimme a tighter one on two.... with a Channel 4 News exclusive.
Brian?
Panda watch.
The mood is tense.
I have been on some serious, serious reports, but nothing like this.
Ching...
I tried to get an interview, but they said, "You can' t.
He' s a live bear.
He will literally rip your face off. "
Hey!
You' re making me look stupid!
Get out here!
Panda jerk!
Great story.
Compelling and rich.
That' s gonna do it for all of us at Channel 4 News.
You stay classy, San Diego.
I' m Ron Burgundy?
Damn it!
Who typed a question mark on the Teleprompter?
For the last time, anything you put on that prompter,
Burgundy will read.
Oh, God, this is a mistake.
This is a mistake.
He' s very cute.
Very cute.
No, he' s not.
He' s hairy.
There she is!
Veronica!
My little China doll.
I am full of it tonight.
Oh, silly.
Hi.
You look ravishing.
It truly is beauty and the beast.
I might add a handsome beast at that.
Are you ready for our rendezvous?
It' s not a date.
No, strictly professional.
Doesn' t mean we can' t have fun.
- Shall we?
- Yes.
San Diego.
Drink it in.
It always goes down smooth.
What a beautiful view, Mr. Burgundy.
I know.
I love this city.
It' s a... it' s a fact.
It' s the greatest city in the history of mankind.
Discovered by the Germans in 1904.
They named it San Diago, which of course in German means a whale' s vagina.
N... no, there' s no way that' s correct.
I' m sorry.
I was trying to impress you.
I don' t know what it means.
I' il be honest.
I don' t think anyone knows what it means anymore.
Scholars maintain that the translation was lost hundreds of years ago.
Doesn' t it mean Saint Diego?
No.
No.
No, that' s... that' s what it means.
Really.
Well, agree to disagree.
May I take your order?
Yes, I am going to have three fingers of Glenlivet with a little bit of pepper, and, uh, some cheese.
Very good.
A Manhattan, and kick the vermouth in the side with a pair of steel- toed boots.
- Certainly.
- Thank you, Scott.
Thank you.
Quite a drink order.
Oh, well, when in Rome.
Yes?
Please, go on.
Uh, do as the Romans do?
It' s an old expression.
I' ve never heard of it.
- It' s wonderful, though.
Mr. Burgundy.
- Tino!
How are you?
- So good to see you.
You' re looking fantastic.
Tino, Veronica.
Veronica.
What a pretty girlfriend.
- Drinks are on Tino tonight.
- No, no, no.
We' re work associates.
I work at the station.
- I' m a journalist.
- Oh, okay.
This is a good guy.
Tino' s the finest club owner in the city.
- My best friend, right?
- Yes.
Yes, we have a saying in my country about people like him.
"The coyote of the desert always likes to eat the heart of the young, where the blood drips down to children for breakfast, lunch and dinner,
- only the ribs will be broken in two. "
- Tino.
Okay.
Well, Mr. Burgundy, we will be honored if you will play "yazz" flute for us.
- I can' t.
- Please.
- You play jazz flute?
- Oh.
Would everyone love to hear Ron Burgundy play "yazz" flute?
- Get it goin ', Ronnie!
- Yes!
Please.
You, on stage now.
Okay, I guess I can play a little ditty.
- Come on.
- Give him a hand.
- I' m not prepared.
Not at all.
- Yeah!
- This is a surprise, I' il tell you.
Guys, "East Harlem Shakedown," E flat?
Keep the cymbals splashy, and, Jay, let' s take the bass line for a walk.
Hold on.
I' m not hearing it right.
Hold on.
We got it now.
It' s all right.
Fire up, Ronnie!
Little "Ham and Eggs" comin 'at you.
Hope you got your griddles.
That' s baby- makin 'music, that' s what that is.
- Let' s go!
Hey, Aqualung!
Thank you.
Thank you!
You were amazing.
Thank you.
Where did you learn to play like that?
Well, jazz flute has always been a small passion of mine.
So what other passions do you have, Mr. Burgundy?
like a flaming golden hawk:
To one day become a network anchor.
Well, believe it or not, we share the same dream.
I too want to be an network anchor.
God, you are so beautiful.
We really should be going.
I swore that I would never get involved with a coworker.
Wait.
What if, just for tonight, we weren' t coworkers?
We were co- people?
- Shh.
You be a woman.
I' il be a man.
That' s all.
You continue to surprise me, Mr. Burgundy.
Oh, I' m storming your castle on my steed, milady.
Oh, mi corazón es en fuego!
Julio, fuego, fuego, fuego!
Wait, stop.
Stop talking like that.
- I can' t understand you.
Take me to Pleasure Town!
- Oh!
# Love is like candy on a shelf #
I friggin 'love you!
I friggin 'love you back!
Look!
The most glorious rainbow ever!
Oh, do me on it!
# The greatest wealth that exists in the world. #
Well done, sir.
Tip of the cap to you as well, Miss Corningstone.
I' m having very strong feelings for you, Mr. Burgundy.
But it' s very important to me that I be viewed as a professional.
- Hmm.
When in Rome.
Yeah.
That, uh, expression doesn' t really apply to what I' m talking about.
- What I was saying.
I still don' t quite understand what it means.
You' il find it.
No, I was saying that, if we continue seeing each other, that we should keep it relatively quiet around the station.
Absolutely, my wild love tigress.
Tasteful discretion is the name of the game.
Veronica Corningstone and I had sex, and now we are in love!
Did I say that loud?
Yeah, you pretty much yelled it.
Well, I can' t help it.
It' s fantastic!
- What' s it like, Ron?
- The intimate times?
Outta sight, my man!
No.
The other thing.
Love.
Yeah.
What is that?
Well, it' s tough to explain.
- I think I was in love once.
- Really, what was her name?
I don' t remember.
That' s not a good start, but keep going.
She was Brazilian.
Or Chinese, or something weird.
I met her in the bathroom of a K- mart, and we made out for hours.
Then we parted ways, never to see each other again.
I' m pretty sure that' s not love.
Damn it!
I love... carpet.
I love desk.
Are you just looking at things in the office and saying you love them?
I love lamp.
Do you really love the lamp, or are you saying it because you saw it?
I love lamp!
I love lamp.
You really want to know what love is?
- Yeah.
- Yes, tell us.
More than anything in the world.
Well, it' s really quite simple.
It' s kind of like...
- You guys have it, I think.
I don' t know, Ron.
That sounds kinda crazy.
Sounds like you have mental problems, man.
- Yeah, you got mental problems, man.
- Yeah, he really does.
Man.
- Wanna make a phone call.
- Freshen this up.
Oh, look out.
Next up, it' s Whiskerus Maximus.
He' s ready to do battle in the arena against the tiniest lion you' ve ever imagined.
I' m getting some great stuff, Miss Corningstone.
Shut up.
Oh, I hate cats.
Let' s just do my sign- off and get outta here.
It was quite a show down here at the Pet Shack.
Just for today, fashion curiosity did not kill the cat.
I' m Veronica Corningstone for Channel 4 News.
That was our newest reporter, Veronica Corningstone.
She' s really great.
I' d also like to share with you that we are currently dating and that she is quite a handful in the bedroom.
That' s gonna do it for all of us here at 6: 00.
For the Channel 4 News Team, I' m Ron Burgundy.
You stay classy, San Diego.
All clear.
I might be in trouble on that one.
I can' t believe that you said that we were dating on the air.
That is good fondue.
Don' t you get it, Ron?
I wanna be an anchor.
That is never gonna happen if everyone in San Diego thinks that I' m your bimbo gal pal.
I don' t know what to say.
I got excited.
I just wanted to shout it from on top of a mountain.
But I didn' t have a mountain.
I had a newsroom and a camera.
Look.
I report the news.
That' s what I do.
And today' s top story, in Ron Burgundy' s world, read something like this:
I love Veronica Corningstone.
Oh, Ron.
This is nice, gang, sittin 'here.
- Oh, yeah.
- Brown baggin 'it.
The team pancake breakfast is tomorrow morning at 9: 00 instead of 8: 00.
Almost forgot.
I won' t be able to make it, fellas.
Veronica and I are trying this new fad called, uh, jogging.
I believe it' s jogging or yogging.
It might be a soft "J."
I' m not sure, but apparently you just run for an extended period of time.
- It' s supposed to be wild.
- So Ron' s not coming?
No, Ron' s coming.
It' s the pancake breakfast.
We do it every month.
I realize that.
Sometimes you gotta look yourself in the mirror and say, "When in Rome."
The bottom line is, you' ve been spending a lot of time with this lady.
You' re a member of the Channel 4 News Team.
- That' s a given.
- We need you.
Hell, I need you.
I' m a mess without ya.
I miss you so damn much.
I miss being with you.
I miss being near you.
I miss your laugh.
I miss your scent.
I miss your musk.
I think you and me should get an apartment together.
Just take it easy, Champ.
Why don' t you stop talking for a while?
Maybe sit the next couple of plays out.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, I' m gonna quit sayin 'things when they crop up in the ol' skull, huh?
See what it' s like when you' re not here?
You' re our leader.
Look what you' re doing to the group.
Champ' s been a mess.
Brick can' t sleep at night.
I don' t trust this chick.
We need you around, and she is just using you.
Everyone, just relax.
All right?
Believe me, if there' s one thing Ron Burgundy knows, it' s women.
Okay, and Veronica Corningstone, she' s just... she' s just dying to quit her job so that she can take care of me and have babies.
Hey, gang.
Papa' s home.
Oh, honey.
I am so glad you' re home.
My alabaster doll.
Gentlemen.
You look great.
No eye contact!
Oh, darling.
I' ve spent all day cleaning your Emmys and preparing dinner in the nude.
Oh, let' s make whoopie.
And then I' m going to go drinking with the news team for two days.
Wonderful.
Wonderful!
Bite it!
Bite it!
- Oh, yes!
- Oh, yeah!
You are a bad boy.
I' m bad.
I need to go to the principal' s office.
I love my life.
I don' t know, Ron.
Guess what.
I do.
I know that one day, Veronica and I are gonna get married on top of a mountain.
And there' s going to be flutes playing and trombones and flowers and garlands of fresh herbs.
And we will dance till the sun rises.
And then our children will form a family band.
And we will tour the countryside, and you won' t be invited!
I' m telling you, this lady has really crawled into Ron' s head.
Good.
Good one!
Oh, okay.
I understand.
You have a nice day, sir.
Bye.
Um, I could come back later, Mr. Harken.
No, no, no.
It' s just parent stuff.
It seems that our youngest, Chris, was on something called acid and was firing a bow and arrow into a crowd.
- You know how kids are.
Right.
Anyhoo, what can I do you for?
Well, Mr. Harken,
I feel like I have proven myself as a journalist and that I deserve the opportunity to take on more challenging stories.
Well, ask and you shall receive.
Ah, yes, this just came across my desk.
Here is a story of a 103- year- old woman who claims to have a recipe for the world' s greatest meat loaf.
Ooh, now that' s a hot lead.
It was very hard for Veronica.
But she was a pro and hung tough.
But soon, with a simple act of littering, everyone' s life would change forever.
# Oh, Baxter, you are my little gentleman #
# I' il take you to foggy London Town #
# Because you are what? #
# My little gentleman. #
This burrito is delicious, but it is filling.
Antony and Cleopatra!
Goddamn son of...
What the hell, bro '?
Hello, neighbor.
Did you just throw a burrito out your window?
I believe I did.
Are you high or something?
Did you see what happened?
I did.
That was a terrific spill.
That' s quite a raspberry.
That' s my chopper you just thrashed, Broseph.
Easy, compadre.
I' m your friend out here, all right?
I want you to fix my chopper before I stomp your goofy ass!
If you want to throw down, fine.
I' ve got Jack Johnson and Tom O' Leary waiting for you.
You destroyed the only thing I love.
All right?
There it is.
What do you love?
I love poetry.
And a glass of Scotch.
And, of course, my friend Baxter here.
Well, guess what.
Now this is happenin '.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
- That' s how I roll.
Baxter!
No!
- Where the hell is he?
- He' il be here.
- I thought he was Mr. Dependable.
- It' s not like Ron.
I' d put Brick on, but unless he' s tracking a storm front, he' s useless.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
Hello.
Just want you to know if Ron does not show up, I am ready to go on.
You and I have had this discussion a million times.
There' s never been a woman anchor.
Mr. Harken,
- Oh.
You' re gonna deprive them of that because I have breasts?
Exquisite breasts?
I am gonna go on, and if you want to stop me, bring it on.
Because I am good at three things: fighting, screwing and reading the news.
I' ve already done one of those today, so what' s the other one gonna be?
Screwing?
I will be in makeup.
Jesus, she' s terrifying!
- Fantana.
Ron, are you okay?
The man punted Baxter!
- Calm down.
Breathe, Ron, breathe.
The man that loved the motorcycle!
What did the bad man do?
The motorcycle on the bridge!
I hit him with a burrito!
- Ron!
- He took him!
He took him with his foot and he kicked him!
That' s what he did!
Someone punted him?
No, wait.
Wait.
Let me say something.
Let me say something.
- What?
I didn' t understand one word you said.
Ron, are you okay?
Ron?
Ron.
Where are you?
I' m in a glass case of emotion!
He' s gonna put Corningstone on.
He' s gonna put Corningstone on!
I' ve got to do the news!
You' re not Ron.
We' re on in 10.
Good luck, lady.
Ready the announce.
- Power.
- Roll in.
Power.
Power.
Whammy.
And your reporter in the field,
Brian Fantana.
It' s Channel 4 News at 6: 00.
Good evening.
Ron Burgundy is off tonight.
I' m Veronica Corningstone.
Tonight' s top story:
- Okay, we' re off and running.
- Three armed men wearing ski masks made off with over $20, 000 from an area bank in a daring early morning robbery.
Hey!
And the winner of the frog- leaping contest was Hoppy, with a jump of seven feet, 10 inches.
I used to date a guy named Hoppy down in Alabama.
He was quite a jumper, too.
That will do it for us at 6: 00.
From all of us here at Channel 4 News,
I' m Veronica Corningstone, and thanks for stopping by, San Diego.
- All clear!
Yes!
Yes!
Lady!
Lady!
Not bad, Miss Corningstone.
Not bad at all.
Thank you, Mr. Harken.
That felt good.
- That felt really good.
- I liked your sign- off line, too.
You did?
It just came through me.
It was so organic.
Thank you.
Oh, Ron!
Ron!
Ron, darling!
I' m so glad you' re all right.
Oh, God.
I have something magnificent to tell you.
I' m here.
We can do the news now.
It' s all right, everyone!
We can do the news.
Hold on.
Why are we all standing around?
Let' s go!
Ron, we did it.
Veronica filled in for you.
What?
Sweetheart, we were so worried about you, and we waited as long as we could, but...
I nailed it.
Wait, wait!
Veronica, please, tell me this is some kind of sick, tasteless joke.
You weren' t here.
Why are you being this way?
Why can' t you be proud of me as a peer and as my gentleman lover?
Oh, Jeez.
I can' t believe you did this to me!
You read my news!
I told you that I wanted to be an anchor.
I told you that.
I thought you were kidding!
I thought it was a joke!
I even wrote it down in my diary!
"Veronica had a very funny joke today."
I laughed at it later that night!
I can' t believe that I cared for you.
Get out!
Just go!
Through!
Because of your actions, you scorpion woman!
You have broken my heart, Mr. Burgundy.
You have broken my heart.
From there on out, things just got worse for Ron Burgundy.
Corningstone was a star, and everything started to move awfully fast
- after her big break.
Ian!
All right, I got a call from network.
It looks like our broadcast last night received a two- point ratings boost, and the decision has been passed down to make Veronica our co- anchor.
- What?
- No.
No!
No!
- No!
- No!
- No!
- This is wonderful.
You big silly man.
- We did it.
- What is this, amateur hour?
- That' s great.
- Thank you. - # Sunshine, go away today... # - Damn it!
# I don' t feel much like dancing #
# Some man' s gone, he' s trying to run my life #
# Don' t know what he' s asking #
What Brian didn' t tell you was that those were not real pirates.
- They looked convincing, though.
- Oh, yes.
Well, for all of us here at Channel 4 News,
I' m Ron Burgundy.
You stay classy, San Diego.
And thanks for stopping by.
But mainly stay classy.
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Stay classy, I' m Ron Burgundy.
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Stay classy.
- Ron Burgundy.
You are a real hooker, and I' m gonna slap you in public.
You have way too much pubic hair.
Actually, that' s a point of pride.
I' m very proud of my mane of pubic hair, so thank you.
You have man boobs.
You' ve got a dirty, whorish mouth.
I' m gonna punch you in the ovary.
- Ooh, ow.
Right to the baby- maker.
Ah, jazz flute is for little fairy boys.
Okay, you know what?
That' s uncalled for.
I can' t work with this woman.
It' s terrible.
- It' s ringing.
Veronica Corningstone.
Hello, Veronica, this is Mike Rithjin from the network.
You' ve just been promoted.
You' re gonna need to move to Moscow.
Start cleaning up your desk.
See you in the morning.
We' il pick you up in a van.
What did you say your name was?
Mike Ritnitjun.
It' s not important.
Start cleaning your desk, and we' il pick you up in the morning.
Tell her she might want to get a coat.
Hold on.
Veronica?
What was it?
Tell her to get a coat.
Also, I don' t know if you know Moscow.
It' s pretty cold.
You might want to buy a coat.
Are you and Champ having a good time, Ron?
Are we what?
I can see you, Ron.
What?
I can see you.
Okay.
Bye- bye.
- What happened?
- She knew it was me.
You' re watching Channel 4 News with five- time Emmy award- winning anchor
Ron Burgundy and Tits McGee.
Good evening, San Diego.
I' m Veronica Corningstone.
Tits McGee is on vacation.
I' m Ron Burgundy.
- Veronica Corningstone.
- This is your doctor.
I have your pregnancy report here, and guess what.
You got knocked up.
You should probably get out of news.
- Who is this?
- This is Dr. Chim.
- Dr. Chim Richalds.
- Ron, is this you?
- I' m a professional doctor.
You saw me.
You don' t remember.
- We... you should move.
- Get out of the business.
- This is pathetic.
You' re pathetic.
What' d she say?
I think she bought it.
She' s looking this way.
- Here she comes.
I' il tell you what, it' s just not working.
She' s making us look like a bunch of fools.
- Ellen, where' s the party?
Children, grow up.
Son of a bee sting.
She' s turning the entire office against us.
- This is grim.
Real grim.
- What are we gonna do?
There' s only one thing a man can do when he' s suffering from a spiritual and existential funk.
Go to the zoo, flip off the monkeys?
No.
Buy new suits.
Yea!
Where' s the suit store?
We' ve been walking for 45 minutes.
Brick, I thought you said this was a shortcut.
Fantastic.
- Is it a shortcut or not?
- Okay.
Jeez.
Hey.
Here comes trouble.
Burgundy and the ladies went out for a stroll, huh?
You boys walkin 'around and talkin' things through?
Keep a tight perimeter.
Yes, sirree.
Well, well, well.
Ron Burgundy and the Channel 4 News Team.
Where' s your mommy?
You back off, Evening News Team.
You know, I understand that, uh, they had to bring a female in.
Change your diapers.
Wipe the dribble away from your bubblin 'lips.
Rub Vaseline all over your heinie and tell you that it' s special and different from everyone else' s.
He said "heinie"!
Brick, get back over here!
Heinie!
Does she tuck you in, Ronnie?
Give you a little kiss on your forehead?
Tell you everything' s gonna be okay?
I' ve had enough of you, Mantooth.
This is gonna end right here, right now.
Let' s dance, dickweed.
You wanna dance, Ronnie?
I wanna polka.
Come get a taste.
Brick, where' d you get a hand grenade?
I don' t know.
All right.
Let' s do this!
Hey!
If you' re gonna have a fight, then don' t forget Channel 2 News with me,
lead anchor Frank Vitchard.
You dirtbags have been in third place for five years.
Yeah?
Well, you' re about to be in dead place.
Not so fast, you ingrates!
Public News Team is taking a break from its pledge drive to kick some ass.
No commercials!
No mercy!
Cómo están, pinches!
Spanish Language News is here.
Tonight' s top story:
The sewers run red with Burgundy' s blood.
Well looks like we got ourselves a bilingual bloodfest.
Now, before we do this, let' s go over the ground rules.
Rule number one:
No touching of the hair or face.
Of course.
And that' s it!
Now let' s do this!
- Begin!
I' m gonna straight- up murder your ass!
- Blade!
- Here you go, mate!
God!
I did not see that coming!
- Now I' il be number one.
- No, you won' t!
- Policía!
Boy, that escalated quickly.
I mean, that really got out of hand fast.
- It jumped up a notch.
- It did, didn' t it?
Yeah, I stabbed a man in the heart.
I saw that.
Brick killed a guy.
- Did you throw a trident?
- Yeah.
There were horses and a man on fire and I killed a guy with a trident.
I' ve been meaning to talk to you about that.
Find yourself a safe house or a relative close by.
Lay low for a while, because you' re probably wanted for murder.
I' m proud of you fellas.
You kept your head on a swivel.
That' s what you gotta do when you' re in a vicious cockfight.
Can you believe Mantooth and the Channel 9 Evening News Team?
"Where' s your mommy?
Someone' s gotta change your diapers. "
This Corningstone business is really hurting our rep.
I know exactly what you mean, Brian.
Every newsman in this city' s laughing at us.
- And I don' t like it.
- I don' t like the put- downs.
We' re gonna do something about it.
It is time to put an end to this!
Last time I looked, my name' s Ron Burgundy.
What' s your name?
- Brian Fantana.
- Champ Kind.
- Brian Fantana.
- No, you' re Brick.
- Brian.
- I' m Brian.
Veronica.
And I' ve shown you, old man!
Garth, I need to look at these tapes for a potential lead.
Ron' s using the machine to play his local Emmy acceptance speech from last year.
I tried to ask her out on a date.
Turn the music off!
I' m still talking!
- This is ridiculous!
- I don' t remember doing it.
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing?
I need this machine so I can watch a tape for a story.
I' m using the tape.
I' m showing Jeffrey my Emmy tape.
We are watching history.
Mr. Burgundy, I' m a professional, and I would like to be able to do my job.
Big deal!
I am very professional!
Mr. Burgundy, you are acting like a baby.
I' m not a baby, I am a man.
I am an anchorman!
You are not a man.
You are a big fat joke!
I' m a man who discovered the wheel and built the Eiffel Tower out of metal and brawn.
That' s what kind of man I am.
You' re just a woman with a small brain.
With a brain a third the size of us.
It' s science.
I will have you know that I have more talent and more intelligence in my little finger than you do in your entire body, sir!
You are a smelly pirate hooker!
You look like a blueberry.
Why don' t you go back to your home on Whore Island?
Well, you have bad hair.
What did you say?
looks stupid.
- Let 'em work it out!
- It' s between the two of them!
Just talking.
- I hate you!
- I hate you more!
Shut up!
All right, stop!
Stop what you' re doing right now!
I will not have my newsroom be divided.
Knights of Columbus, that hurts!
Veronica:
I was like, "Who is that guy?"
I just can' t believe what Ron did to you.
It is so awful.
Yes.
Have you ever thought about fighting fire with fire?
What do you mean?
I have some information that you can choose to use or not use.
Up to you.
Ron Burgundy will read anything that is put on that Teleprompter.
I mean an- y- thing.
Arnold, cue one.
After the FotoMat was destroyed, the bear scampered back into the woods.
Apparently he wasn' t too happy with his color prints.
From the entire Channel 4 News Team,
I' m Veronica Corningstone.
And I' m Ron Burgundy.
Go fuck yourself, San Diego.
What in the name...
No!
Nobody talks about my city that way!
Ron Burgundy' s ass is grass!
Nice work, everyone.
Sharp broadcast.
Really good.
Everyone on the floor as well.
Really a lot of hustle.
I liked it.
Dump out!
Hello, Edward.
- Ron, I' ve got to fire you.
- I' ve got to fire you.
You' re fired, Ed.
Do you even know what you just said?
Great Odin' s raven!
Are you happy, Ron?
Veronica.
She put that in the Teleprompter.
Real bad.
I...
I gotta fire you.
Ed, let' s hold on.
Let' s count to 10.
That' s a rash decision.
Is this about something else?
Ed, there' s 300 very angry San Diego- ites.
San Diego- ins.
San Diego- uns.
- San Dieg- ons.
- San Diegans.
San Diegans out in front of the station.
They want Ron' s blood.
They want to hurt you.
Why did you say that?
Why?
Why, Ron?
Why?
You' re my hero, Ron.
Garth, I...
And you come out with stink like that poop!
You poop mouth!
Get all the poop out of your mouth!
If I were to give you money out of my wallet, would that ease the pain?
I hate you, Ron Burgundy!
I hate you!
Ron?
Ron!
I never wanted it to be like this.
I can' t believe you did this to me!
Are you happy?
No, Ron, I' m not!
It was supposed to be a joke.
I mean, it' s still kind of funny.
But it' s not.
I have nothing left!
Nothing!
I' ve been reduced to rubble!
Don' t you know I would never say the word fuck?
I would never fucking ever fucking say that!
Ever!
Let' s go.
These people are about to pull you apart.
I' m sorry.
Get your hands off him, you bastards!
Don' t you know I would never say fuck?
- Fuck!
- Move.
No!
No!
Mr. Burgundy, you should be ashamed of yourself.
- You' re an awful man!
You are truly a disappointment to us all, Mr. Burgundy!
Bob Dylan once wrote,
"The times, they are a- changin '."
Ron Burgundy had never heard that song.
So when he fell, he fell hard.
It' s Channel 4 News at 6: 00!
Good evening, San Diego.
I' m lead anchor Veronica Corningstone.
Tonight' s top story: an ultrasound of Ling Wong, the most famous panda in the world, shows that her baby is doing quite well.
- No!
Ron Burgundy, stay classy.
Hello, this is Ron.
Hello.
Who' s there?
I' m talking.
Hello.
Who is this?
Baxter, is that you?
Baxter!
Bark twice if you' re in Milwaukee.
Is this Wilt Chamberlain?
Have the courage to say something.
Hello!
Hello!
Oh, Tino, thank you for letting me come in here.
I' m glad I can still get a good meal.
Yeah sure.
Here you are, the chef made this special for you.
You eat that for the way you talk about my city.
I will not eat that.
You' re going to eat that cat poo.
I will not eat cat poop.
- You will eat cat poo.
- Ron Burgundy says no!
You make a fool of me and everyone here.
You put that cat poo in your mouth.
- No!
- Yes!
- No!
- Sí!
- I will not eat cat poop.
- You will do it immediately!
- No!
- You will!
- Get in there.
If I take one bite will you get me a steak?
If I take one bite of shit will you bring me a steak?
I' il think about it.
Yeah, get in there.
- Yeah, start with the end.
- I am so hungry.
- There.
- Oh God!
A steak.
A big steak for him, please.
No!
I had one bite.
- That' s not enough.
- Son of a bitch.
- You like this?
Don' t cry.
He' s not crying.
- I' il eat the shit.
I don' t care.
I' il eat the entire hunk of shit.
Okay, just finish it up.
Don' t you feel better now?
Hey, you watch yourself, mister.
Hey, lady in the red hat.
Yeah.
You smell.
Guys.
Guys, it' s me, Ron.
Fellas!
Harken said he' d fire us if we talked to you.
- What?
- I' m sorry.
Brian!
- It' s Ronnie!
- Ron!
- Champ!
- Ron!
Champ, come on.
Come on!
Go, Brick.
My sweet Brick.
Brick, come hug me.
I know you want to.
I am completely miserable, San Diego!
It' s so damn hot!
Milk was a bad choice!
Yes, yes.
Chris, listen to me.
Put down the gun and let the marching band go.
- We' il play it off as a prank.
We' il straighten it out later.
I' m getting another call.
Ed Harken.
What?
Oh, my God!
Listen, everybody, Ling Wong the panda is giving birth!
Get Corningstone over there right away!
The network is picking up the feed.
I want a shot of that panda being born!
This is Ted Nightingale, Channel 6 News Los Angeles, reporting from the San Diego Zoo.
And this is the moment the entire world has been waiting for.
I can only speculate as to the sex of the panda, but if I had to guess, I' d say female.
- Excuse me.
Press.
- Hey, lady, watch it.
Thank you.
What do you got?
Nothing.
All I can see is a blue curtain.
Oh, damn it.
Go over there and see if you can get a shot.
I' il go this way.
Hey, lady, why don' t you go fetch me a sandwich?
- Okay, I' il go get your sandwich.
Then I' il show you the ratings where you' re number two to a woman.
Don' t lose any more hair over it.
- Whatever.
- We' re live, Mr. Mantooth.
Good afternoon, San Diego.
We' re here today to celebrate the birth of a panda.
# I make fart noises with my mouth # - # And I like to cut... # - Hey, nut job!
Quit the singin '!
Creeping out all the regulars.
I' m expressing my inner anguish through the majesty of song!
Look, drunkie, you been coming in here every day, stinking up the joint with your craziness.
Now, what the hell is wrong with you?
I got no heart!
Because a she- devil stole it!
You know what the worst part about it is?
She' s better than me!
She' s better than me.
You know, times are changing.
Ladies can do stuff now.
You' re gonna have to learn how to deal with that.
What?
Were you saying something?
Look, I don' t speak Spanish.
Scotty.
Scotty, I have the shot.
Scotty.
Scotty!
Hey, uh, that is some fantastic shot you got there.
The kind of shot that gets you to the top of network news.
- Oh, well, we hope.
- We at public television, we' re really down with the woman' s lib thing.
That is so refreshing to me.
Because the struggle I' ve...
- Howie, we have the shot.
Up, up.
You son of a bitch!
Don' t want to wake up your friends.
Help!
- Simply vanished.
- How do you lose your lead anchor?
- I can' t find Corningstone.
- Where the hell is she?
- No one' s seen her.
- I can' t believe this.
Every news outlet in the world is looking for coverage on this.
I' ve got no damn lead anchor!
Damn it!
Get me a phone.
I can' t believe I' m about to do this.
Rocky' s, bar, grill, fine dining.
- Is there an anchorman there?
- Hold on.
This is killing me.
I' d rather slit my throat.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Is this Ron?
- Who is this?
- It' s me.
Ed.
- Who?
- Ed Harken.
- I don' t know a Ned.
- Ed Harken!
- Ed!
- Ed, hello.
- Listen, Ron.
Corningstone disappeared in the midst of the biggest story of the year.
We need you down here right away.
Wait, Ed.
Does this mean you' re asking me to report the news again?
- Yes.
- Ed!
That' s wonderful!
Thank you!
Ed, hold on.
I want to say a few words.
- You have always been a good friend!
- Right.
- Always!
- Right.
Get down here as quickly as you can.
Ed, I' il be down there.
And I' m going to look good.
Good evening.
I' m Ron Burgundy.
Damn!
That dude cleans up good!
If I' m gonna do this, I' il need my news team at my side.
News team!
Assemble!
News team, assemble!
Hey, Ron.
What' s up?
Hi.
Didn' t see you there.
We' ve been here literally the entire time you have.
I' m a little embarrassed.
Look.
I just got the call from Harken.
He wants me back.
But I can' t do this without my news team.
I don' t know, Ron.
That was half a lifetime ago.
We' re different people now.
When you left, the hurt was so deep.
I don' t know if I can go through that again.
Think about what you' re asking.
Man.
Gentlemen, there was a time when you called me your lead anchor.
Will you follow me again?
I' m gettin 'too old for this shit.
To the news van!
- To the news van!
- Okay!
Ron Burgundy.
He' s back!
Gentlemen, let' s try to get in a good position for the story.
- How does the hair look?
- Magnificent.
You have hair like an angel.
Network talent scout.
- This is a hot one.
- I' m actually nervous.
- Let' s go get 'em.
Wait!
Did you just hear something?
- Help.
- Ron, help!
- Veronica!
- Shh!
How did you get down there?
Just go get someone.
Please.
Hold on!
We' ve got to do something.
Whoa, Ron, I don' t want to sound cruel, but...
There' s a network talent scout over there.
This is a tough decision.
So much to think about.
I used to have familiar relations with.
This is hard!
I am in a pickle!
Ron, I know it sounds harsh, but God does not want her to live.
No.
Hold on.
It' s clear now.
We go into the bear pit.
Ron, don' t.
I immediately regret this decision.
What are you doing?
Why didn' t you get help?
These bears are massive!
They looked a lot smaller from up there.
Fan out.
Let' s go find Harken.
Stay calm.
It' s all right.
I think it' s all right, my sweet chinchilla.
- Oh, Ron.
- Yes, yes.
In case we die here today, there' s something that you should know.
That dirty trick with the Teleprompter, it wasn' t...
Sweet Eli Whitney' s nose!
It wasn' t you, was it?
It was Wes Mantooth.
- Oh, I should have known.
- No, no.
- No, I did it.
- You bitch!
You woke the bears.
Why did you do that?
There' s somebody in the bear pit!
It took my impending death for me to realize how much I need you.
Oh, Ron.
Those bears are gonna hurt them!
News team, let' s hunt.
News team!
Bear fight!
Come on!
Damn!
Hit 'em in the uvula!
Hey, Ron!
I' m riding a furry tractor!
The bears have descended on the news team and it' s not going well.
Clearly, after today, I will no longer...
Come on!
Oh, God!
It' s getting to be ri- goddamn- diculous!
Oh, no.
We woke up the mama.
Oh, God!
I don' t wanna die.
- Baxter!
Veronica:
They' re following their mother!
It' s instinct.
Oh, Baxter!
Oh, Baxter, you' re still alive!
Oh, I' m so happy!
I' m so happy!
You are alive!
I' m so happy!
I will lick you!
I will lick you in front of everyone to show my joy.
Boy, he really likes that dog.
Burgundy!
Burgundy!
Burgundy!
Burgundy!
Burgundy!
Burgundy!
Hi, Ron.
It' s always a long fall from the top, isn' t it?
Easy, Wes.
I' ve been waiting to say this to you for a long time.
- All right.
I pure, straight hate you!
But, God damn it, do I respect you!
Thank you, brother.
Burgundy!
Burgundy!
Today we spell redemption
R- O- N.
Burgundy!
Burgundy!
Ron, you' re my hero!
Ron, I think you' ve got a story to report.
Are you sure, Ed?
Do it.
It' s the story you were born to tell.
San Diego' s waiting.
Go get 'em.
Make way!
Ron Burgundy' s about to report on pandas!
Count me down.
Three.
Scotty:
You' re live, Mr. Burgundy.
This is Ron Burgundy, proudly reporting once again for Channel 4 News.
Today' s story is one of the more remarkable things ever to happen to San Diago or even the world.
I' m going to need some help from my co- anchor,
Miss Veronica Corningstone.
- No, no, no, no, Brick.
- Go stand over there.
Oh, Ron.
Ron, there are literally thousands of men that I should be with instead, but I am 72% sure that I love you.
Yes, redemption was sweet for Ron Burgundy.
Yes!
Ron!
- As for the news team:
- Stop it!
Ron!
Champ Kind went on to become a commentator for the NFL, but was later fired after being accused of sexual harassment by Terry Bradshaw.
Excuse me.
Is that Sex Panther you' re wearing?
"Intercourse Island" on the Fox Network.
Anyone seen Brick?
- Brick?
- Don' t!
That tickles!
No, that tickles me!
Come on!
Brick Tamland is married with 11 children and is one of the top political advisors to the Bush White House.
I' m gonna get you!
And Ron and Veronica didn' t stay in San Diego long.
I chose them as my replacement, and they became the first mixed- gender network news team, and they' re still doing it today.
From all of us here at the World News Center,
I' m Veronica Corningstone.
And I' m Ron Burgundy.
You stay classy, planet Earth.
# Carry on, my wayward son #
Great Odin' s raven!
By the hammer of Thor!
Saint Damien' s beard!
Sweet grandmother' s spatula!
Hot pot of coffee!
Uncle Jonathan' s corncob pipe!
I' m gonna shoot you with a BB gun when you' re not looking.
In the back of the head.
- I' m sorry.
You' re not very bright.
You know that, right?
You' re actually quite a dullard.
Everyone here knows it.
If I' m a dullard, you' re the, uh, the dull...
Can' t think of anything to say, can you?
Yes, I can.
I can think of a lot of things to say.
Like, you' re a dirty bitch.
Well, Ron, I' m gonna put poison...
Oh, my God!
I drank a lava lamp.
It wasn' t lava.
I ate a whole bunch of fiberglass insulation.
It wasn' t cotton candy like that guy said.
My stomach' s itchy.
I pooped a hammer.
I pooped a tape recorder.
I pooped a Cornish game hen.
Nope.
'cause I will give you a rap right on the Jack Johnson!
- Okay.
- Yes.
Now this is happenin '.
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
What are you...
Action.
We' il go back to doing what I do best...
I guess we' il go back to doing what I do best, show off.
When do we get started?
When do we get started?
- That' s my line.
- When do we get started?
You say, "Whenever you like."
- Whenever you like.
Keep it rollin '.
This is good stuff.
... an area bank in a daring...
Probably not the same one.
Probably not the same guy.
Brick, before I let you go, are you still having your celebrity golf tournament this summer?
No, too many people died last year.
So we' re not gonna do...
Sorry.
They named it San Diego.
Which in German means, "a whale' s vagina."
This is the most ridiculous thing ever.
Way to handle him.
That was nice.
It sure is good to be number one.
It sure beats the hell out of number two.
We are laughing!
And we are very good friends.
Good buddies sharing a special moment.
Don' t say anything, Ron.
Just let it happen.
We' re laughing, enjoying our friendship.
And someday we' il look back on this with much fondness.
Yeah.
Yeah.
- Come on, yes - Let' s go back to God
Oh...

That boy hangin 'by a thread, Over the pit,
Fiery pit!
"Left My Wallet in El Segundo,"
Ooh!
67 years of life, 46 years of marriage,
You mean to tell me you never once suffered from piles?
Well, it' s the human condition,
Most humans, anyhow,
Like that ballplayer said, "The world' s got two kind of folks,"
"Them that' s got the piles and them that' s goin 'get' em,"
But you always was healthy as a ox,
Passed on 'fore you could get the piles, Mm- hm,
Ooh, thank the Lord you never was sick,
I just want to pass away nice and peaceful,
Go to sleep one night, wake up in the glory land!
Whoo!
Pickles!
- Go fetch Pickles!
- Pickles?
Oh, he' s up that tree again!
You' d better shimmy on up,
Well, I do apologize, madam, but... won' t the feline eventually tire of his lonely perch and, pining for his master' s affection, return on his own initiative?
Uh, the point being, must we actually ascend the tree?
Look, I don' t want no doubletalk,
Now, if you not gon 'fetch him, I guess I gotta call the police,
- Police?
- And they not goin 'be happy,
Every time they have to fetch him, they swear they' il never do it no more,
No need to call the authorities, madam,
I did this often as a child,
I was a positive lemur, Here, kitty!
- Oh, don' t upset him now!
- I wouldn' t think of it, madam,
Harmless little Felix domesticus,
Here, Kitty, Come to G, H,
Come, come, Here, kitty, Here, kitty,
Come, come, come, No, no, no,
That' s not how Sheriff Wyner do it,
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Come, come, come,
Come to the professor,
Yes, Y...
Ah!
Uh... thank you, madam, for your act of kindness,
- Well, you let him out, - I certainly did, and for that I apologize no end,
Allow me to present myself, um, formally,
Goldthwait Higginson Dorr, Ph, D,
Like Elmer?
- I beg your pardon, ma' am?
- Fudd,
No, no, Ph, D, is a mark of academic attainment bestowed, in my case, in recognition of my mastery of the antique languages of Latin and Greek,
I also hold a number of other advanced degrees, including the baccalaureate from a school in Paris, France, called the Sorbonne,
Sore bone, Well, that fits,
You ever study at Bob Jones University?
I have not had that privilege,
Oh, that' s a Bible school, Only the finest in the country,
- I send 'em $5 every month, - That is very generous...
- I' m on the mailin 'list!
I' m a Angel, - Are you?
Yes,
Oh, they list my name in the newsletter every issue,
- Do they?
- Oh, I got the literature right over here,
- if you' d like to examine it...
- Perhaps when my head has recovered from its, uh... uh, buffeting,
Mrs, Munson, are you at all curious as to why I darkened your door, as the expression would have it, on this lovely, lovely camellia- scented morn?
Well, I was wonderin 'till you let Pickles out,
- I quite understand, - Then in all the excitement...
The fact is, I saw the sign in your window advertising a room to let?
And there are no other such signs among the houses
- on this charming, charming street, - Yeah, I got a room, $15 a week, I' m lookin 'for a quiet tenant,
Madam, you are addressing a man who is quiet and yet not quiet, If I may offer a riddle,
I am currently on sabbatical from the institution where I teach, the University of Mississippi at Hattiesburg,
I am takin 'a year off to indulge my passion, and I do not believe that is too strong a word,
- for the music of the Renaissance, - Mm- hm,
I perform in, and have the honor of directing, a period- instrument ensemble that performs at Renaissance Fairs and other cultural fora throughout central and southern Mississippi,
We perform on the instruments for which the music was originally composed,
Now, wait a minute, You got some kind of band?
Oh, no, The word "band" would be, in this context, something of a misnomer,
Though we do play together, hence the word "ensemble", the nature of the music is such that, well, one would hesitate to apply the epithet "band"
- with connotations of janglin 'rhythms, - So y' all ain' t playin' no hippity- hop?
"I Left My Wallet in El Segundo", Songs with the titles spelled all funny?
Oh, no, no, We play music that has been composed to the greater glory of God,
Devotional music, Church music,
Gospel music?
Well, inspired by the gospel, certainly,
The vintage, of course, is no more recent than the Rococo,
Rococo, huh?
Well, I guess that' d be OK,
But I don' t propose to inflict our rehearsals on you,
May I inquire, do you have a root cellar?
Yes,
Yes, yes,
This looks promising,
A little dank, ain' t it?
Indeed, That only improves the acoustics,
Marvelous,
Yes, Ah!
lute or sackbut,
That is why so much music of the cinquecento was played in crypts and catacombs, This is ideal, This is perfect, This is more than perfect,
- I can scarcely contain my glee, - Oh, you containin 'it OK,
You gotta peel this shit out, man, Sometimes it stick to the bottom,
Hey, this shit smells like piles,
You wouldn' t even believe this, man, Even out here on the casino floor you gonna find goddamn mercy pads, Tucks...
I don' t know what the fuck people be doin 'here while they gamblin',
Man, I ain' t peelin 'no funky shit with my human hands,
- and shit attackin 'your fuckin' insides, - Oh, well, shit, you gotta do it,
'cause Mr, Gudge checks everything,
This tunnel leads back onto the land for all the people that work for Mannex,
Mannex Corporation, They own the Bandit Queen, three other boats,
Now, this is where they think on their corporate shit, Gudge and them,
I mean, the light' s as ugly as all hell, but, shit, ain' t as many Tucks,
- Let me in, motherfucker!
- What' s the password?
Kiss my ass!
Now, this is where they count the dough, Now, if you try to take any of it,
Elron over there' il shoot yo 'ass, Goddamn!
Dawg, this is a motherfuckin 'pigsty, man!
You are a squeakyass, motherfuckin 'pig!
Man, look at your ass, You got Cocoa Krispies on your uniform,
Got breakfast there, and you still eatin 'goddamn lunch, man,
I swear to God, if that ass was nickels, you' d be a motherfuckin 'millionaire,
Spread out, boy, Look at you, You a disgraceful fucka!
You is a fat motherfucker, man!

Cut, cut, cut!
Goddamn it, his canteen fell off, Props!
- The goddamn thing' s canteen fell off, - OK, We' re prepared for that,
Mountain, put Otto into the apparatus,
- What the hell is this?
- World War I vintage gas mask,
It' s authentic, Strapped on, of course, so it can' t fall off,
Now, the animal is free to be as active as he wants,
I think it really sells the whole doughboy thing,
- It looks like a fucking joke, - Uh, you' re absolutely right,
The gas mask is a whimsical concept,
How the hell does it eat when it gets to the Nibbles Ready- to- Eat?
- Well, you' re absolutely right, - Don' t let the clients see this,
- Or that Humane fucker, - No, of course not,
They' il just shut the fuckin 'spot down, Pancake, They' il shut...... shut the fuckin' spot down, OK?
Put the goddamn canteen back on the dog, That says he' s a soldier!
Dented tin canteen, All right?
Strap it to his fucking collar!
Easiest thing in the world, I- I just thought...
What?... but you' re right, A canteen' s much better, Good concept, Let' s go with that,
- What' s he doing?
- Well, he' s, uh...
- Just breathe normally, Otto, - The fucking dog can' t breathe,
Oh, no, he can breathe, Eh, eh, that thing is...
- Just breathe normally, Otto, - The fuckin 'dog can' t breathe,
The fuckin 'dog cannot breathe!
OK?
Get the fu...
Get that fuckin 'thing off of him,
Of course, Easiest thing in the world,
I don' t have my Leatherman, Mountain, give me your Leatherman, Chop, chop!
Chitra!
Make sure that Humane fucker doesn' t come over here, OK?
Distract him, He' il shit if he sees this,
There we go, Mountain, have electric run me a stinger,
Don' t give up on me, Otto!
Mountain, I need two live leads!
Uh, eh, but, Garth, the gennie' s a hundred yards away,
Goddamn it, Otto' s gonna have irreversible brain damage in about 30 seconds,
Here we go, OK, kiss of life,
Otto is fuckin 'dead!
What the fuck are you doing?!
Otto is fuckin 'dead!
320!
320!
Hut!
Ugh!
L- left, 90- tiger, x- slant, On one, Ready?
Break!
Hut!
Ugh!
Ooh!
Split left, 68, Z- go,
- You the man, Hey, butthead!
- Huh?
- You the man!
- Me the man?
On one, Ready?
Break!
390!
390!
Hut!
Ugh!
Oh, no!
Get your ass off the field!
Get your ass off the field!
Goddamn it!
Hudson, get your ass out of my game!
You couldn' t catch a cold!
A' ight, Dragon Lady, we want that fuckin 'money,
We want that doughnut money,
OK, papa- san...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,... we want that doughnut money,
We ain' t fuckin 'around, Mr, Hi- Ho,
You give us all the fuckin 'money, you won' t get shot in the head,
A' ight?
You got three seconds,
You got three fucking seconds, a' ight?
One, two, three, You understand?
- We want that doughnut money!
- I' m a count uno, and two and...
His fingers are way the fuck up my nose!
Get your fingers out my man' s nose!
Cafe?
Ah!
Aah!
I know you all remember that when Moses came down the mountain carrying the Word of God, come down that Sinai peak,
- he caught them Israelites red- handed, - Yes!
What' d he catch 'em doin'?
- a golden calf, - Yes!
He caught 'em worshippin' a false god,
He caught them Israelites in decline,
In decline!
What did Moses do when he saw those... declinin ', backslidin', never- mindin 'sinners?
What did he do?
Yes, he did!
I smite, you smite, he smites, we done smote!
To smite is to go upside the head!
Because sometimes, brothers and sisters, that' s the only way!
The only way,
To smite is to remind we got to stop that decline and scramble back up to the face of the Almighty God!
- Amen!
- Instead of worshippin 'that golden calf, that earthly trash on that garbage island,
That garbage island in the shadowland, wa- a- ay...
way outside the Kingdom of God!
That garbage island, where scavenger birds feast on the bones of the backslidin 'damned!
let us pray,
My dear lady, I do so hope this is not an inopportune time for our first practice,
Somebody die?
I beg your pardon?
Oh!
No, no, no, No, I' m not bereaved,
Though it is so kind of you to inquire, The hearse is simply a vehicle commodious enough to accommodate all the members of our ensemble,
And, of course, our instruments contrived in an age ignorant of miniaturization,
Allow me to introduce my friends, my colleagues, these devoted and passionate musicians,
Ain' t no smokin 'in this house,
Oh, Sorry,
What do you think, General?
Present any problems?
Good then, Gentlemen, why don' t we crowd around and go over the plan?
Gentlemen, this is the Bandit Queen, Gambling den, Cash cow,
Sodom of the Mississippi Delta and the focus of our little exercise,
Here is Orchard Street,
Here is the residence of Marva Munson, the charming lady whom you all met moments ago,
Gentlemen, I' m sure you' re all aware that the Solons of the state of Mississippi, to wit, its legislature, have decreed that no gaming establishment shall be erected within its borders upon dry land,
They may, however, legally float,
While the gambling activity is restricted to these riverboats, no such restrictions apply to the functions ancillary to this cash- besotted business,
The casino' s offices, locker rooms, facilities to cook and clean, and, most importantly, its counting houses, the reinforced, secret, super- secure repositories of the lucre, may all be situated... wherever,
- Gawain, where is "wherever"?
- Say what?
- Where' s the money?
- Oh,
OK, look, At the end of every shift, pit boss brings the cash down to the hold of the ship in a locked cashbox, and once a day all the cash is moved down to the countin 'room,
And where is the counting room?
Uh... it be right there in that square where you pointin ',
And what, to flog a horse that if not dead is at this point in mortal danger of expiring, does this little square represent?
Offices, Underground,
Ha!
Underground!
Mmm!
Underground,
During the casino' s hours of operation, the door to this counting room is fiercely guarded,
The door itself is of redoubtable Pittsburgh steel,
When the casino closes this entire underground complex is locked up, and the armed guard retreats to the casino' s main entrance,
There, then, far from the guard, reposes the money, behind a five- inch- thick steel portal, yes, But the walls... the walls are but humble masonry behind which is only the soft, loamy soil deposited over centuries by the Old Man, the meanderin 'Mississippi, as it fanned its way back and forth across the great alluvial plain, leaving earth,
This earth,
The General here, whose curriculum vitae comprehends massive tunnelin 'experience through the soil of his native French Indochina, shall be directin' our little old tunnelin 'operation,
Garth Pancake, though a master of none, is a jack of all those trades corollary to our aim,
- as our little caper shall require, - Happy to be on board,
Gawain is our proverbial "inside man,"
He has managed to secure himself a berth on the custodial staff of the Bandit Queen,
- Damn skippy!
- And this brings us to Lump,
To look at Lump, you might wonder what specialized expertise could he possibly offer our merry little old band of miscreants,
Well, gentlemen, in a project of such risks, it is imperative to enlist the services of a hooligan, a goon, an ape, a physical brute,
And, on our behalf, I wish him a warm Mississippi welcome,
- Fuckin 'A, - Whassup, my nigga?
Well, gentlemen, here you are,
Men of different backgrounds and differing talents,
Men with, in fact, but two things in common:
One, you all saw fit to answer my advertisement in the Memphis Scimitar, and two, you' re all going to be, in consequence, very, very, incredibly... rich,
Let us revel in our adventure, gentlemen,
Let us make beautiful music together, and, by all means, let us keep this to ourselves,
What we say in this root cellar, let it stay in this root cellar,
There' s no "l" in "team",
It' s OK, Don' t stop on account of me,
No, No, no, no, no, Not at all, madam,
Not at all, We were about to take a break anyway,
The glissandi on this particular piece are technically very, very demanding, and I' m sure we would all welcome a moment of R and R,
Well, I just thought maybe you' d like to see...
What have you gotten into, honey?
Why you sweatin 'like that?
Uh...
Uh, eh, 'cause,' cause...
That boy right there?
He plays one bitch barrel full of a sackbut!
- Ain' t that right, Lump?
- Uh- huh,
I' m tellin 'you, he can tear it up, Right, Lump?
Ain' t nobody play the sackbut like Lump right there, He...
Hoo- hoo- hoo!
Don' t be shy, Lump, Don' t be shy, Lump, that boy, he go... at it like it was some pussy!
- Oh, shit!
- Mind your mouth!
This is a Christian house, boy, No hippity- hop language in here,
- Sometime it' s the only way, - Now listen, you ain' t gonna hit me...
I' m tryin 'to help you, boy, better yourself!
And so you should, madam, So you should,
Gawain is so far transported by his love of the music of the early Renaissance...
Don' t make me no never- mind, he transported!
- I understand, - You been smokin '?
Oh, certainly not, ma' am, I understand your indignation, ma' am,
And I was offering an explanation, not an excuse,
- I myself am...
- Hey, hey, hey...... don' t be explainin 'me, dawg!
You can' t read my motherfuckin 'mind, man!
You might got yo 'Ph, D,, but I got my GED!
- Yes, - Nigga!
A fiery lad... but then youth is fiery,
A fact often remarked upon by the poets of the Romantic era,
My youth, I was in church, I wasn' t walkin 'around fiery,
Youth ain' t no excuse for nothin ',
Anyhow, I just came to show you the fife, Othar' s fife, Burned his own,
I thought maybe, you bein 'a man of music, you' d be interested,
Oh, indeed I am,
Cut it hisself and burned his holes,
The Israelites called it a khalil,
Yeah, you can read all about it in the Bible, Ain' t nothin 'new under the sun,
Indeed not,
Gone these 20 years,
He was some kind of man,
Blowed the khalil,
I don' t suppose Othar ever turned his hand or, or turned his lip to blowing the shofar?
The ceremonial ram' s horn sounded by the priests of the Hebrews,
No, I don' t know nothin 'about that, Othar never blowed no shofar!
- Of course not, - Not to the extent of my knowledge,
The khalil was good enough for my Othar,
He was some kind of man,
Some kind of man,
Oh, goddamn!
Come on, girl, let me get one little peek,
Don' t be cruel, Come on, just one butt cheek,
Pull that ass out and make it clap,
Aw, just 'cause I' m dressed like a janitor, don' t mean you gotta do me dirty,
This muthafucka' s hit the jackpot, Come on, girl,
Come over here and blow on these dice,
You know, I' m a seven on the roll now, but I' m a 10 the hard way, and I ain' t just talkin 'crap,
Mr, Gudge, she had a ass that could pull a bus,
I mean, Gudge, it was more than an ass, it was literature,
Yeah, I don' t care how big her ass was, MacSam, You' re fired,
You say what?
There is no fraternizing with customers on the Bandit Queen,
- Clean out your locker, - But, Mr, Gudge, I wasn' t fraterniz...
I said get outta here, You' re fired,
You can' t fire me!
I' il sue your ass!
Sue me?
For what?
For fuckin 'punitive damages, man!
- Punitive damages, - Yeah,
Punitive damages, You goddamn skippy!
- Punitive damages, - I see why you firin 'me, Mr, Gudge,
Yeah, it' s simple and plain, You firin 'me' cause I' m black,
MacSam, everybody on the custodial staff is black,
Your replacement is gonna be black,
His replacement, no doubt, will be black!
Well, the fuckin 'judge is goin' be black, muthafucka,
- Oh, - And you?
- You gon 'stand tall before the man, - Oh,
And your replacement' s gonna be black,
- muthafucka!
- Thank you,
Oh, my,
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my, my,
This is a severe setback,
I am distraught, I' m more than distraught,
I am devastated,
I- I' m beside myself, I' m at a positive loss for words,
- You still talkin 'OK, though, - Have you all decided?
Madam, we must have waffles, We must all have waffles forthwith,
We must all think, We must all have waffles and think, each and every one of us, to the very best of his ability,
Perhaps if you apologized to the man and gave him flowers,
Or perhaps a fruit basket with a card depicting a misty seascape and inscribed with a sentiment,
I ain' t apologizin 'to that muthafucka, He fired me' cause I' m black!
He can' t do that, You could sue him, Open and shut case,
- Fuckin 'A, - Surely a chocolate assortment has been known to melt the heart of even the hardest misanthrope,
That man ain' t rollin 'over for no fucking candy bar,
Uh, we' ve had a bit of a setback on the tunneling front, too,
- We' ve run into a pretty large rock, - Rock!
- Very bad, Very bad, - Oh, my,
Seems that the poet was right,
Troubles never singly come,
Oh, no, we can get through the rock, No worries there,
Easiest thing in the world, Why, we just blow right through it,
I got a pyro license, Just, uh, bore a hole in the rock and pack in a little plastique, Igneous blows pretty good,
- And then we could...
- Hello, Garth,
- Am I ordering the primer cord?
- Yes, Mountain,
We were just talking about that, and some plastique,
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh, this is Mountain Girl,
Mountain is my right hand, She helps me out with ordnance,
- Helps me with... damn near everything, - Hey,
You brought yo 'bitch to the Waffle Hut?
I must confess myself to be puzzled as well,
"mum" was the word,
Of course, I understand that, but this is Mountain Girl,
I don' t keep secrets from Mountain,
That' s not how you maintain a loving, caring relationship,
You brought yo 'bitch to the Waffle Hut!
The man brought his bitch... to the Waffle Hut!
All right, look, you, I will thank you to stop referring to Mountain that way,
She is the other half of my life,
Everybody lookin 'at me like I' m some kind of fuck- up for losin' a sorry- ass job, and this muthafucka brings his bitch
- to the muthafuckin 'Waffle Hut!
- Son- of- a- bitch punk!
- Shut your goddamn mouth!
- You better raise the fuck up, fucka!
- Gentlemen, please, - Back the fuck up!
You gon 'back that shit the fuck up!
- Gentlemen, please, - What?!
Please, gentlemen, this behavior does you no credit in the eyes of your colleagues, nor in those of the other patrons of this Waffle Hut,
Little punk,
Oh, look at this, I got blueberry syrup on my safari jacket!
Gentlemen, I propose that we consider the matter of this woman,
- Mountain Girl,
I' m so very sorry, I propose that we consider this matter closed,
And we shall choose to trust her since we have no choice, and since she shall share only in Mr, Pancake 's portion of the booty,
Of course, Wouldn' t have it any other way,
- Yeah, you damn right you won' t, - Up yours, punk,
- Oh, fuck you and the Swiss Miss, - The matter of disposing
Coach...
-... closed, Settled,
That leaves us only with the question of Gawain retrieving his job,
- Coach, I...
- Yes, Lump?
Couldn' t we just bribe the guy?
You are a readin 'fool, aren' t you, Mr, Dorr?
Yes, I must confess,
I often find myself more at home in these ancient volumes than I do in the hustle- bustle of the modern world,
To me, paradoxically, the literature of the so- called "dead tongues" holds more currency than this morning' s newspaper,
In these books, in these volumes, there is the accumulated wisdom of mankind, which succors me when the day is hard and the night lonely and long,
Mm, The wisdom of mankind, huh?
- What about the wisdom of the Lord?
- Oh...
Yes, yes, The Good Book, mm, I have found reward in its pages,
But, to me, there are other good books as well,
Heavy volumes of antiquity freighted with the insights of man' s glorious age,
And then, of course, I just love, love, love the works of Mr, Edgar Allan Poe,
Oh, I know who he was, Kinda spooky,
No, madam, no, no,
Not of this world, it' s true,
He... he lived in a dream, An ancient dream,
Like those Nicean barks of yore,
Who was Helen?
- Some kinda whore of Babylon?
- One doesn' t know who Helen was... but I picture her as being very, very... extremely... pale,
Mrs, Munson, I have been trying to figure out some way of expressin 'my gratitude to you for takin' in this weary, wayworn wanderer,
It' s just a little old present, Why, it' s hardly anything at all,
Oh, why, Mr, Dorr!
You are a gallant man,
Oh, madam, I blush, I melt, No...
I just happened to hear of this gospel concert tomorrow night,
"The Mighty, Mighty Clouds of Joy", and I thought you and a friend from church perhaps would...?
- Yes, I have a widow lady friend, - The concert is up in Memphis, so I have arranged a car service to transport you thither,
Ah?
Why, Sheriff Wyner!
How you doin '?
I just stopped by here to let you know I did have a talk with Weemack, and he told me he' s gonna comply with your request in keepin 'that music down and neighborly,
So you just go and have yourself a pleasant evenin ',
Wait a minute, I got somebody that I want you to meet,
I' m a little pressed for time,
You got a gang of bank robbers youse chasin '?
Come on in here and say hello,
Yeah, we was in here, havin 'tea and...
Huh!
Bussed his own dishes, You can always tell a gentleman,
- Somebody was in here, ma' am?
- Yeah, with me and Othar,
Maybe I' il catch him the next time,
Oh, come on up to his room with me and say hello,
I got a family, My wife got dinner on the table,
I really have to be goin ',
- Oh, my, He is neat!
- Yes, ma' am, he very neat,
He probably went down to the cellar to play with his friends,
Ma' am, I really got to be goin 'now,
- What...?
- Ma' am, I really need to be gettin 'back,
Mrs, Munson, don' t...
You don' t have to...
Mrs, Munson?
Why, Professor!
What in the world are you doin 'havin' tea down there?
Uh...
Mrs, Munson?
Oh, Lord Jesus,
- Mrs, Munson?
- Land of Goshen, child!
- Come on out from under there!
- Mrs, Munson, my pager just went off,
I got to go, Mm- hm, I' il meet you and your friend later,
That was refreshing,
Y' all have a good evenin 'now!
- into confined spaces, - Mm!
At Yale, the students will see how many of their number they can enclose in a telephone booth, At Harvard, a broom closet,
Hope I didn' t spill my tea,
Well, what the hell is this?
I guess it' s just my way of sayin ', um...
Oh, well, goddamn it, Mr, Gudge, Look here, I...
I don' t know what it' s like walkin 'in your shoes,
You know, with you bein 'a tight- ass and all,
And I' m pretty sure you don' t know what it' s like walkin 'in my shoes,
See, Mr, Gudge, there' s the custodian, right?
And then there' s the man inside the custodian,
And that' s the motherfucker we got a problem with,
See, 'cause that man, he got needs, Mr, Gudge, and normally those needs gotta do with women with big asses,
I guess my point bein 'is I realize I' m a bunkie junkie,
But if you woulda seen the kettle drums on this girl, Mr, Gudge, whew!
Well... we all human,
This apology buys you a one- week probationary period,
Thank you, Mr, Gudge,
Stay away from the customers, MacSam,
This drill bit' s getting awfully hot,
Gawain, maybe you could fill a Hudson sprayer and spritz it down while I drill,
Fuck you, I ain' t your motherfuckin 'house nigger, I' m the inside man,
All right, look, are you gonna have a bug up your ass for the rest of the time we work together?
- I' il get the sprayer, - Oh, no, no, No,
Me and this gentleman here have to get square,
Let me tell you somethin ', MacSam,
I' m gonna tell you about how I came down to Mississippi,
I wasn' t born here, you know, I' m from Scranton, Pennsylvania,
What the fuck?
Scranton, Pennsylvania, Came down here in 1964, Greyhound bus,
Do you know who the Freedom Riders were, MacSam?
No, and I don' t give a fuck,
Just tell me when the fuck they gonna leave, Damn!
The Freedom Riders, my fine young man, were a group of concerned liberals from up north, all working together, just like we are here,
Involved citizens who came down here so that local black folk could have their civil liberties,
So that people like you could have the vote,
- You know what, man?
- What, brother?
- I don' t vote, So fuck you, - You little fuckin 'ingrate,
- And the bus you rode in on, jackass!
- Let' s step outside, MacSam!
Come on!
What?!
My friend Mrs, Funthes is here, so I' m about to go out,
Just thought I' d leave y' all with some cinnamon cookies,
Why, that is lovely,
Ooh, y' all sound good!
- give us a recital, - Why, how kind of you!
Uh, a bit Roman in its outlook,
Uh, many of our pieces were commissioned by the Holy See,
Oh, I see, all right, but we don' t make no big whoop- dee- do about denomination,
Everybody welcome at our church, Yeah, we had a Methodist come in,
Episcopalian, Back in the '60s, we had a Jew come in!
- He had a guitar, - (chucking) A Jew with a guitar,
If you will excuse me one moment, madam, I shall, uh, I shall see you out,
If you gentlemen can labor harmoniously in the course of my absence, perhaps upon my return we shall be prepared to explode that vexin 'old piece of igneous,
Oh, Professor!
This is Mrs, Funthes,
Enchanté, Mrs, Funthes, Allow me,
Rosalie, this is Professor G, H, Dorr, Ph, D,
Oh, my, That' s an awful lot of letters,
Oh, well, no,
Of course, in my youth, I was known simply as Goldthwait,
Uh- huh,
All right, safety meeting,
Let' s listen up, General, can you hand me the primer cord?
Before we set the charge, we will run through our procedure,
I have earplugs for whoever wants them, Just wedge those right in your ears,
Now, here we have...
Not yet, Lump,
- Oh, - Now, primer cord,
Gelatinite, C- 4,
Time comes, we pack the hole in the rock with the C- 4 and insert two leads:
A and B,
I remember my father sayin 'to me - and it' s one of the few memories I retain of the man from one of his visits home, and how I do cherish it - he said to me, "Goldthwait, you are not formed as other boys,"
He a man of learnin '?
This is the same procedure we will be using when we collapse the tunnel after entering the casino vault and returning to the root cellar,
He was a self- educated man, Didn' t have a career as such, but the government did recognize the breadth of his readin 'by makin' him librarian of the state nervous hospital in Meridian, where he was a distinguished inmate,
Once these materials are combined only the professionals may handle them,
That means me or the General,
Separately they are harmless, completely inert,
Why, you could light this stuff on fire, hit it with a ham... (explosion)
What in the name of heavens was that?
I' m quite certain there' s absolutely no reason to be alarmed,
Why, I' m not even absolutely certain I heard anything at all,
Didn' t hear nothin '?!
Well, something perhaps,
Nothing that need discompose us was the sense I was tryin 'to convey,
Now, Mrs, Munson, I will not have you missin 'your musical recital, Off you go!
Whatever subterranean utility is implicated in this contretemps,
I shall see to the matter, as only a highly educated classicist could,
Blood!
Blood, Professor, blood!
Blood, blood, blood!
(Pancake) It' s nothin 'to make a fuss about, It' s perfectly all right,
Jackass!
You better get yo 'ass back down there and find that shit, dipshit!
- Really, I' m perfectly all right, - Perfectly all right?
Jackass, you just blew your goddamn finger off!
The muthafucka down there flappin 'the fuck around!
You better get yo 'ass back down there and find it!
I' m tellin 'you right now, nubbie, I ain' t pickin' up your goddamn finger!
I gather there was a premature detonation,
Would you tell this muthafucka he can sew this shit back on?!
It' s like that dude whose wife cut his dick off, threw it on the freeway?
She just called Triple A, they towed the dick and sewed the muthafucka back on!
Listen up!
Jackass, I saw the muthafucka in a porno!
The thang still worked!
It looked like a chewed- up frank, but that little muthafucka be workin 'that muthafucka!
It' s mangly, but he be fuckin 'the bitch all kind of ways with a twisted dick!
Your fuckin 'finger just moved!
The muthafucka movin 'slow now!
I' m not gettin 'that shit, Fuck that!
You' re on your own there!
They usin 'the house to practice music... of the Rococo,
Mmm- hm,
I propose we get our fallen comrade to the hospital,
The General will follow when he manages to recover the severed digit,
No, no, really, I' m perfectly all right, I don' t know what all the fuss is about,
- Good news!
Good news!
Go get him!
The house is in apple- pie order, though we do have to get medical attention for Mr, Pancake, who, durin 'the disturbance, pinched his finger in the valve of his sackbut,
You let the cat out!
Wha...?
The General is even now exercisin 'every effort in retrievin' your mischievous little Pickles, Please, go on,
Go on and enjoy the concert!
Driver!
Au revoir, mesdames,
(Dorr) Despite our setback, we find ourselves on schedule to penetrate the vault here this afternoon, while Mrs, Munson is at church, havin 'blasted that little old rock to pieces durin' Mrs, Munson' s choir practice,
Garth, can you run us through the game plan for what remains of our tunnel?
Of course, Why, it' s child' s play now, Easiest thing in the world,
Only a couple of feet separate us from the vault,
Just the usual spadework until we get to the masonry of the vault, and then we just drill through,
And will you be able to wield the drill with your maimed extremity?
Oh, well, yeah, I should think so, Yeah, it' s, uh, it' s only one finger,
Inhibits me in doing finer work of course, I' il always have to live with that, (clears throat)
I should get a little extra compensation for the accident,
Somewhat larger share,
Why, if this was any other line of work, I' d be getting workman' s comp,
Might even have a pretty good lawsuit,
Wait, so you gonna sue yourself for blowing your own goddamn finger off?
- Well, now that is simply asinine, - Yes, but you see, Garth, this is not what you just called "some other line of work,"
Yeah, no, no, no, but if it were...
This is a criminal enterprise, not to put too fine a point on it, entailing any manner of risk not involved in honest labor,
Governmental regulations and civic safeguards cannot be assumed to apply to antisocial pursuits,
- Yeah, but he lost his finger, - We don' t give a fuck!
That fool could blow his goddamn dick off, it don' t make no nevermind to us!
We not payin 'this jackass for goin' around blowin 'off goddamn body parts!
Get yo 'fuckin' head out yo 'ass, man!
Look you, there is no call for...
No extra share!
OK, Majority rules,
Like I say, it was just a trial balloon, Hand' s not so bad really,
I even get some phantom feeling,
Yeah, you pull on your prick, you get some phantom feelin ',
- Fuck you, - Fuck you,
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you, nubbie!
Well, now that that matter is settled, why don' t we synchronize our watches before Gawain reports to work,
In 20 seconds, it will be exactly 12: 16,
- Fifteen...
- What, it' il be 12: 15?
No, 15 seconds, Well, 11 seconds now, It' il be 12: 16,
- Eight, seven...
- Professor?
Prof...? -... six...
- Professor?... five...
Yes, Lump!
I don' t have a watch,
Whoo- hoo- hoo!
Ain' t that somethin '!
- I, B, S, - You be what?
Irritable Bowel Syndrome!
Is there a men' s room down here?
Oh, come on, You shouldn' t be usin 'the men' s room now!
Or a lady' s room, (sniffs) Quickly, I, B, S,
If you knew you had the runs, why didn' t you shit back at the house?
Quickly!
We don' t want Elron finding your stinkin 'ass on the crapper!
No choice, It' s a medical condition, Quickly!
You one disgustin 'individual, you know that?
Come on, Follow me,
I feel 30 pounds lighter,
- Come the fuck on with your stinkass, - Thank you for being so understanding,
Not everyone is, of course, which is why the biggest challenge of I, B, S, is educating the public,
Afflicts over two million people, yet most of us have never heard of it,
And it strikes without regard to age, gender or race,
Oh, fuck, man, I don' t wanna hear about this shit,
Well, that' s exactly the kind of attitude we' re fighting,
I guess I never told you that' s how Mountain Girl and I met,
They had an I, B, S, weekend at Grossinger' s up in the Catskills,
Of course, the tourist business there has suffered with the demise of the Borscht Belt, so they have various promotions, mixers, so on,
- and share stories, - Man, look here,
I don' t want to hear a single one of them stories, OK?
- Now, some of them are very moving, - Not one fucking story!
- Look, I didn' t choose to have I, B, S, - Man, shut the fuck up!
There' s no cure, you know, Only control, Lifelong condition,
Yeah, you know what?
Bein 'an asshole' s a lifelong condition, too,
Just drop the fuckin 'tools,
I' m not complaining, I did meet Mountain Girl,
Man, get back in the fuckin 'hole!
Marvelous, Marv...
This way, gentlemen!
Excellent!
Excellent, Flawless, flawless, Thumbs up,
Can' t stop shittin ', Can' t stop talkin' about shittin ',
Gentlemen, to we few, We who have shared each other' s company, each other' s cares, each other' s joys, and who shall now reap the fruits of our communal efforts, shoulder to shoulder, from each according to his abilities, so forth and whatnot,
We have had our little differences along the way, but I' d like to think that they' ve only made us value one another all the more,
Each of us coming to understand and appreciate the other' s unique qualities and potencies and, yes, foibles,
I suggest that we shall look back upon this little caper one day, one distant day, grandchildren dandled upon our knee, and perhaps a tear will form and we shall say,
"Well, with wit and grit and no small amount of courage, we accomplished something on that day, a feat of derring- do, an enterprise not ignoble,"
We merry band, unbound by the constraints of society and the prejudices of the common ruck,
We happy few,
- Gentlemen, to us!
- (all) To us!
Charge shoulda gone off already,
I do beg your pardon?
The charge to collapse the tunnel, I set it for eight minutes,
Well, that much time and more has certainly elapsed,
I need not remind you, it is of the essence of this plan that the money should appear to have simply vanished without a trace,
- spirited away, as it were, by ghosts, - Of course,
The conundrum of the undisturbed, yet empty vault, the unsolvable riddle of the sealed yet violated sanctum, is of the utmost importance, not only to make our caper more intellectually satisfying, it is exigent as a matter of practical fact,
I remind you that if any tunnel is ever found leading to this house, the owner knows all your names,
You just fart?
Nope, nope, I' m fine, Perfectly all right!
There' s no hole left,
Professor!
I' m surprised!
Well... uh... properly speaking, madam, we are surprised, You are taken aback,
Though I do acknowledge that the sense that you intend is gaining increasing currency through its use, yes,
You have returned from your devotions betimes,
I had to make tea,
I want to talk to you, Professor, so don' t you be leavin '!
And you!
I told you I don' t want any smokin 'in this house!
Oh, come on in!
How you doin '?
Tea, ladies,
Now, I don' t know what you boys been up to, but I know mischief when I see it, Now, I want an explanation, but first,
I want you to get your fannies up here with all y' all' s period instruments,
Now, I been tellin 'the ladies about your music, and they want to hear you play,
- Professor?
- Yes, Lump?
I can' t really play the buttsack,
Madam, or rather, mesdames, you must accept our apologies for not bein 'able to perform, for, as you see, we are shorthanded,
Gawain is still at work, and we could no more play with one part tacit than a horse could canter shy one leg,
Perhaps I could offer, as a poor but ready substitute, a brief poetic recital,
Though I do not pretend to any great oratorical skills, (laughs)
I would be happy to present, with your ladies' permission, verse from the unquiet mind of Mr, Edgar Allan Poe,
That gently, o' er a perfumed sea, The weary, wayworn wanderer bore
- (ladies sigh) - My, my, my,
Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,
To the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome, "(tea lady # 1) Glory hallelujah, (all) Amen!
Hm?
(Dorr) Bye- bye, ladies, It was... it was my pleasure,
- (tea lady # 1) We have to do this again, - (tea lady # 2) Yes, we do got to,
Such a pleasure, Safe home, Safe home, (Mrs. Munson chuckles)
- Now I want to know what' s goin 'on, - Oh, indeed, indeed,
The thirst for knowledge is a very commendable thing,
Though I do believe that when you hear the explanation you shall laugh riotously, slappin 'your knee and perhaps even wipin' away a giddy tear, relieved of your former concern,
Lump here is an avid collector of Indian arrowheads, and having found one simply lying on your cellar floor -
He enlisted the entire ensemble in an all- out effort to sift through the subsoil in search of others,
And apparently, in doing so, we hit a mother lode of natural gas,
I myself became acutely aware of the smell of "rotten eggs,"
- and lit himself a cigarette, - So sorry,
Well, what about all that money?
Ah,
The money, Well, the money is Mr, Pancake' s,
- (clears throat) That' s right, - Who only just remortgaged his home in order to raise the money for a surgical procedure that will correct the wandering eye of his common- law wife, Mountain Water, who suffers from astigmia, strabismus and a general curdling of the vitreous jelly,
Mr, Pancake is an ardent foe of the Federal Reserve, and is, in fact, one of those eccentrics one often reads about hoardin 'his entire life savings, in Mr, Pancake' s case, in a Hefty bag that is his constant companion,
- The Steel Sak, - Don' t trust the banks, Never have,
Mm- mn,
It don' t smell right to me,
- I' m callin 'Sheriff Wyner, - No!
Please, please, Madam!
No, no, I beg of...
Yes!
It is a fantastic tale!
You have us dead to rights, but, madam, please, please, please allow me to tell you the truth in private,
Madam...
Madam, we are not musicians of the late Renaissance,
- Nor of the early, nor mid period, - Mm- hm,
We are, in fact, criminals,
Desperate men, Mrs, Munson,
We have tunneled into the nearby offices of the Bandit Queen gambling emporium
- and relieved it of its treasure, - Lord have mercy,
It is true,
The Bandit Queen is a den of iniquity, a painted harlot luring people into sin by exciting the vice of greed with her promise of easy winnings, Oh, yes,
Her gains are ill- gotten,
But, I offer no excuses - save one,
We men have each pledged one half of our share of the booty to a charitable institution,
In compensation for the use of your home, we had planned to donate a full share to Bob Jones University, without burdening you with guilty knowledge by informing you of same,
But now you have wrested the information from me,
There you have it, It is on your table, Mrs, Munson,
The "awful truth,"
- Stolen money, - But find the victim, Mrs, Munson,
I challenge you, Even the casino itself, that riparian Gomorrah, shall suffer no harm,
A financial behemoth that will cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults,
That is its function,
And that insurance company has tens and tens of thousands of policyholders,
We have done the calculations, Mrs, Munson,
So that at the end of the day, at the final reckoning, each and every one of those policyholders shall have contributed one penny,
One, single, solitary cent to the satisfaction of this claim,
- One penny?
- One penny, Think of it, Mrs, Munson,
One penny from those thousands upon thousands of people so that Bob Jones University can continue on its mission,
Why, I have no doubt that, were those policy holders made aware of the existence of that august institution, each and every one of them would have volunteered some token amount for the furtherance of its aims,
Well, that' s prob' ly true,
Sadly, the criminal stain is upon my soul, but the benefit shall accrue to any number of worthy causes as long, that is, as the secret stays with us,
Well...
I can' t hardly see the harm in it,
- One penny?
- (mouthing) One penny,
- I' m sorry, - Excuse me?
No, I' m sorry, it' s wrong, and don' t you be leadin 'me into temptation,
- No, no, madam, I must strenuously...
- I' m sorry, it' s just plain wrong,
- Stealin '!
- No, madam...
- I know your intentions was good, - No, they weren' t!
And I won' t call the police if you give back the money and y' all go to church with me next Sunday,
And engage in divine worship?!
I' ve made up my mind,
Now, you can doubletalk all you want, It' s church or the county jail,
Think it over, I gotta feed the cat,
- Motherfuck!
- Yes,
Unfortunately, Mrs, Munson has rather complicated the situation,
Yeah, well, I know how to decomplicate it,
You bust a cap in that old bitch' s head, everything be simple,
Not easy to do, Many reasons,
Quiet neighborhood, sleepy town,
Reasons of moral repugnance:
A harmless woman, a deed conceived and executed in cold blood,
Oh, no, Gawain, would that it were simple,
What we gonna do?
Give the money back and go to church?
I shudder, I quake,
You, sir, are a Buddhist,
Is there not a "middle" way?
Mm,
Must float like a leaf on the river of life...... and kill old lady,
Yes, yes, I suppose you are right,
It is the active nature of the crime, though, that so abhors,
The squeezing of the trigger, the plunging of the knife,
But... let us think a moment,
What other tools do we have at hand?
We have the cellar,
We have the cavity,
We have masonry and trowel,
Perhaps we could simply... immure her,
Sure, Easiest thing in the world, I can whip up a little mortar in a snow saucer,
Lay the bricks, Anchor in some chains,
Mountain Girl could outsource the manacles,
Ah, gentlemen, gentlemen, we delude ourselves,
No, shortest and painless is best,
Gawain' s gun, retort muffled by a pillow, into the brain, (claps) The affair of an instant,
The only question is who wields the weapon?
I believe it is traditional in such circumstances to draw straws,
Fair enough, Here you go, Lump,
- and I mean literally lost it 'cause of that fuckin' cat - maybe I should be excused from this thing,
Hard for me to squeeze a trigger anyway,
You one whiny muthafucka,
I' il come over there and squeeze your fuckin 'nutsack, you keep that bullshit up,
Shut up, punk!
- I' il kick your goddamn ass, sweet- legs!
- Gentlemen!
It is of the nature of the situation we would all prefer to be excused,
Well, OK, it was just a trial balloon,
Long straw, You all see it, All that fuss for nothin ', punk,
Fuck you,
Motherfuck!
- (TV) Oh, would you like a hot cross bun?
- No, just an explanation.
Coming up!
- Ouisie, I' il take some cocoa.
- Hi, George.
What' s goin 'on?
George!
How did they get in here?!
- What you got there, Gawain?
- Why, nothin ', Mama,
Nothin ', my ass!
You got a dog there!
- No, Mama, - A filthy, noisy little pest of a puppy dog
- gonna shit all over the house!
- He won' t shit in the house, Mama,
I' m gonna train him, I promise, I' il train him real good!
I' m gonna train you real good!
You wait till your daddy get home, He gonna lay into you proper!
No, Mama!
Please, Mama!
I love you!
Your daddy gonna kick yo 'ass!
Mama' s whuppin 'Gawain' s ass!
Ain' t you gonna use the strap, Mama?
I love you, Mama, I' m sorry, Mama, I love you,
Yeah, I' il wipe the dog' s ass and everything, Mama,
I' il train him to shit in the toilet, Mama,
- I' il wipe his ass and everything, Mama, - What you doin '?
What you doin 'with my pillow?
Nothin ', ma' am, I just came down to get a...
- I' m displeased with you!
- Yeah, but...
- Ugh!
Now, I know your mama taught you better than that!
I can' t do it, She remind me of my mama,
- Look, man...
- Why, this is most irregular,... y' all muthafuckas just gonna have to draw straws again,
Wait a minute, You' ve got to accept your responsibilities, young man, and shoot that old lady,
Hey, man, fuck you and your irritated bowel!
Must shoot,
Now, look here, it' s the easiest thing in the world,
Just pretend her head' s a casaba melon and the gun is a melon baller,
What the fuck are you talkin 'about?
A melon baller?
- Look, man, you do it, - Oh, this is most irregular,
Now, look, with equal rights comes equal responsibility,
I' m afraid Mr, Pancake is correct, We cannot draw straws again,
The exercise would lose all credibility if you show the loser can simply beg off,
Must shoot,
Hey, look, man, she' s just an old colored lady to you,
Come on, man, you do it,
- Why, you sniveling little coward, - What did you say to me?
- Sniveling little coward, - You whiny muthafucka,
I will come up yo 'stankin', irritated asshole with this gun and give you a lead colonic, muthafucka!
You think you scare me, you mewling punk?
You don' t scare me, Bull Connor and all his dogs didn' t scare me!
Now, be a man,
You fuck!
You ain' t no fuckin 'man!
- Oh, my, this is most distressin ', - Be a man!
Fuckin 'a 60- year- old with pigtails!
Why, you bastard punk!
Mountain Girl is 53!
- She could ride your ass to jelly!
- Oh, yeah?!
- Gentlemen, please!
I' d rather stick my dick in than that big ol 'white chick!
Oh, my God,
Oh, no,
Oh, my,
- I think he' s hit, - (Lump) Oh, no,
I' il just check the carotid artery,
- That' s a negative, - Is he dead, Professor?
Oh, sure he' s dead, Lump, I just checked his carotid artery, (Dorr) Well, this is most irregular,
We shall need a Hefty bag,
She is in the kitchen,
You steal out with the carcass while I dazzle her with conversation,
My dear Mrs, Munson, I have outlined your position with my colleagues, and I now return to you to render our collective verdict,
There was much spirited discussion and an atmosphere of frank give- and- take,
Some of our number were initially appalled at your proposal that we simply return the money, Some were more receptive,
I don' t care if they was receptive or not!
And that attitude, madam, was a factor in our discussions,
To a man, I must say they were devastated at the prospect of not being able to contribute to their respective charities,
- Well, that is a shame, - Indeed, but at the end of the day, your position prevailed,
Though that was the original preference of some,
You are not assistin 'with the cadaver,
Oh, no need,
Just chuck it off the bridge, Easiest thing in the world,
- I' m just cleanin 'up here, - (door shuts)
That' s them, Back already,
I' il just go dump these in the hearse,
Yeah, easiest thing in the world,
General!
No extra share, huh?
- Mountain?
- Garth?
- (choking)
Excellent, I believe, at last, we have the right man for the job, (snoring) ("Weeping Mary")
The old woman is a more formidable antagonist than one had imagined, (foghorn blows)
Now, Lump, it falls to you to finish the job,
- The comedy must end, - You know,
- I' ve been doin 'some thinkin', Professor, - Oh, dear,
Maybe we should be goin 'to church, Maybe she is right,
Ooh, dear, Lump, I feared those would be your words,
Not that I don' t appreciate you giving the matter the benefit of your thought, but recall, my dear boy, our respective functions in this enterprise,
I am a professor, The professor, as you yourself so often say, The thinker,
Trained, in fact, in the arts of cogitation,
You, Lump, are the goon, the hooligan, the dumb brute, whose actions must be directed by a higher intelligence,
Yeah, I know, but...
Ah, ah, ah!
No buts, dear boy, Do not repeat the error of thinkin ',
Now is the moment of praxis, Now, Lump, you must act,
Well, I can' t do it, Professor, A nice old lady like that,
Think of the riches, Lump, that you and I alone shall divide,
Yeah, I know, but...
And reflect also that if you decline to act, thus forcin 'me to do so, you shall no longer have any entitlement to the money,
Your offices shall have been nugatory,
You mean you' re gonna kill her?
Of course, yes, My hand shall be forced,
I can' t allow you to do that, Professor,
- Mm- hm,
Not allow?
What presumption!
You stupid boy!
You very, very, extremely stupid boy,
Oh, yeah?
Who looks stupid now?
No bullets?
Perhaps it had to be thus,
How statue- like I see thee stand... "
A raven,
The agate lamp within thy hand! "
"Ah, Psyche, from the regions which
Are Holy Land! "
(gasps)
Couldn' t face the music,
I appreciate that, but we don' t know what to do, Tried that, too,
- Uh, Mrs, Munson...
- Gotta make a statement, Sheriff,
Ma' am, could it possibly wait?
We' re kinda busy down here today,
Oh, well, I suppose it could wait, but it' s about that casino money,
Let me call you back, You know somethin 'about it?
Somethin '?
Everything!
I got it at home,
- You got what at home?
- The money! $1, 6 million dollars,
- It' s down in my root cellar, - How did it get there, Marva?
Well, a bunch of desperate men stole it and put it there, that' s how!
See, they was musicians of the Renaissance period, (chuckles) Turned out they really couldn' t play, but they could recite poems that' d break your heart,
- The ringleader spoke in dead tongues, - Does he now?
Oh, I tried to get you to see him,
- That night, - Yes, ma' am,
I had to holler at 'em about stealin' all that money,
'cause they just picked up and left without takin' the money!
And they let Pickles out!
So you want us to come over and fetch him,
Oh, no, no, he' s back,
What you want me to do with the money?
You keep it!
Why don' t you keep it?
- Keep it?
- Go on and keep it, Miss Marva,
Well...
It is just a penny off of everybody' s policy,
- Could...?
- You don' t suppose I could...?
Could I just give it all to Bob Jones University?
Yeah, That' d be nice,
Give it all to 'em!
That' s a good idea!
As long as everybody knows, ("Let Your Light Shine on Me" by Blind Willie Johnson)
Pickles!
Oh, Lord, Pickles!
I know I got religion and I ain' t ashamed
Why can' t he use the doggy door?
He doesn' t understand.
It' s too new.
Your dog?
Your house.
- Did you see the paper?
- No.
The old man is stepping down.
- What?
- Junior' s taking over.
The king' s dead.
- What a way to let us know.
- Tell me about it.
New York is putting him in charge of both magazines.
Consolidation.
Sales is tight.
There could be some layoffs in editorial, so watch your ass.
Hi, Mr. Gascon would like to see you.
Mr. Gascon Jr., that is.
Hey.
- We' re getting fired, aren' t we?
- I don' t know.
Man.
I just broke up with my girl last Thursday.
That was stupid.
Now I' m gonna have no job and no girl.
I' il end up pushing mochas at Starbucks.
How about you, Quincy?
You still going with that model?
- Helen.
- Don' t break up.
No stress.
Tonight, we' re announcing our engagement at the Zig Zag Club.
- You need to be there.
- After work?
- Yeah.
- After work could be in 1 0 minutes.
Mr. Gascon won' t need to see you.
Thanks.
- See?
- Really?
So I can go?
You can go.
I' m sorry.
- Mr. Watson, he' s ready for you.
- Just me?
- Excuse me.
- No, excuse me.
As you' ve probably heard, Quincy, the company' s downsizing.
Yeah, I heard that.
I have a problem, Quincy.
I' ve gotta let 1 5 percent of staff go.
It' s unfortunate, and it' s necessary.
Yeah.
Now, I see in your résumé...... you went to graduate school in psychology for a year.
Berkeley.
- You' re familiar with crazy people.
- Mostly from living in L. A.
Okay.
What do you know about firing people?
- How' s that?
- I don' t know.
Firing.
Just laying off, in general.
Employee termination, yeah.
There are several studies out.
I haven' t studied it myself.
Why?
Do you know the name Jeffrey Jasper?
- Yeah, the guy from New Jersey.
- That' s it.
Got fired.
Got drunk.
Shot 1 0 executives in the stomach.
Well, I don' t want to be Jaspered.
I don' t know, a guideline or a set of procedural outlines.
Wouldn' t Mr. Peters from human resources be more qualified?
He probably would.
I fired him this morning.
He didn' t like it.
Said he' d kill me with a golf club.
- Mr. Peters?
- A MacGregor 3 lron.
Very specific.
I' d like those guidelines on my desk by Friday afternoon.
- ls that gonna be a problem?
- No, sir.
Helen?
Helen?
Never can be too careful.
Watch out.
Oh, my bad.
You all right?
"See you tonight, love...."
Love you too.
"Termination of Employees:
Psychological Strategies for Employers.
Got somebody you wanna fire? "
Q, relax.
She' s gonna be here, all right?
Relax.
All right, hey.
Let me get the toast.
- To my cousin Q.
- Yes.
To having sex with the same woman for the rest of your life...... over and over and over again.
ln so many different positions.
Don' t you sleep on that.
That' s what you need to do too.
lf she don' t hurry --
- Relax.
She' s gonna be here.
- I' m good.
- You good, but I' m....
- There she is, right there.
There he go.
There he go.
Where you been, huh?
Everybody is waiting on you.
You got Evan, Greg, Lamont, Trey, everybody here.
Where your girls?
- They' re not coming.
- Okay.
Why not?
- I didn' t invite them.
- You wanna break it to them later?
What?
You wanna get a little kissy or something back here in the back?
- I' m getting a bad feeling about this.
- You don' t wanna get engaged now?
Please don' t be mad.
But I think we should take some time off.
Away from each other.
Think things through.
- For what?
- Everything between us is too right.
- Too easy.
Never dramatic.
- What are you talking about?
I' m 25 years old and still waiting for that, you know, grand passion.
I mean, it' s not your fault.
You just don' t do grand.
You don' t do sweeping, romantic gestures.
Look, I wanna marry you.
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.
Ain' t that grand and sweeping?
At least sweeping?
See, you just don' t get it.
I need to be away from you for a while.
- What did I do to you?
- I am so sorry.
You gonna make these people think I hit you.
Where you going?
- It' s not important.
- It' s important to me.
- You don' t wanna know.
- Girl, I wanna know.
- No, you don' t.
- Girl, you better tell me where.
What, you crying?
I' m going to Paris with Tony...
- You going to Paris with who? -... tomorrow.
You' re going to Paris with my best man?
And I gathered these people to announce my engagement?
I was gonna send a letter, but it' s not fair.
Are you high?
Are you smoking?
Write me a letter?
- No.
It wouldn' t have been a postcard.
You know that I love you.
Girl, I don' t even know who you are.
You somebody else right now.
You a alien right now.
Girl, don' t --
- I think she just kicked him to the curb.
- Lord, have mercy.
Quincy.
- Quincy.
What are you doing?
- Hey, Mr. Gascon.
Hey.
You got a handle on it?
- A handle on what?
- On the firing.
Yeah.
I' ve researched.
Got everything together.
- Okay.
All right.
Excellent.
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right, here you go.
- Okay.
All right.
I see names.
- What is --?
What is this?
- Yeah.
Well...... it' s just a little hands- on experience.
Right.
I don' t understand what you' re talking about.
Come on.
What?
Don' t go daft on me here.
- I' m not.
Yeah.
- It' s a list of people who need to be...
-... fired.
You want me to do it?
- Of course.
You' re the expert.
- No, wait a minute.
I was just doing the research.
I didn' t know you were about to fire people.
Yeah.
No, no.
Well, see, I thought I was clear.
- No, no.
- Well, then that' s my error.
All right.
- Sorry.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Well, let me know how it goes.
- Mr. Gascon, listen.
- I am not comfortable with this.
- Well, of course not.
To feel comfortable, you' d have to be a monster.
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, you' re no monster.
Neither am l.
- Right, right.
- I just happen to be in the position...... to delegate, and you are not.
Hey, good luck.
- Quincy.
What' s happening, man?
- Hey, nothing.
- You look awful.
- Thanks.
- Looks like it was quite a blowout.
- Yeah, I was blown out.
- All right.
So, what' s up?
- This and that.
- This and that?
- Yeah.
- Sandra said you wanted to see me.
- Yeah.
- So it' s like that, huh?
- Look....
That' s cool.
Shit!
- Make sure Mr. Gascon gets this.
- Sure.
Q.
Q. Come on, open up the door, man.
Oh, Q. Man, what you wearing, Q?
- You know, it feels good on my skin.
- You gonna let me in?
- What you want?
- That' s for what.
She' s worried about you.
- You can' t call her?
- Been busy.
- You been busy?
- I' ve been busy.
- Move out -- - Watch the piss.
- What' s that?
- You so in a hurry, you ain' t looking.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
- See, this is disturbing, Q.
- Kind of a mess, huh?
It' s like an outer extension of disease.
Where' s your stuff?
Helen, you know, she took some stuff.
Took a TV.
Left me with the dog and a half- naked picture of herself.
Just evil.
- I gave her everything but my soul.
- And I bet they want that too.
- Just greedy.
- Don' t give it to them.
All you gotta do is pretend to give it to them.
Why do I have to pretend?
Why can' t I just be me?
Nobody finds pathetic charming.
Was that cheese?
Okay, look, I' m sorry about Helen, okay?
But you got to pull yourself together, bro.
- I been writing.
- You been writing?
Letters to Helen.
A few letters.
How many letters, Q?
- I could not get the right tone.
- No, how many letters?
I just kept obsessing over the way she left me and what she told me.
Then it came to me, with my employee- termination research...... that if Helen was my boss, then the way she fired me was bad...... bad in every way.
Public humiliation, conflicting messages, horrific timing.
Oh, yeah, I wrote a letter.
I wrote a letter detailing the disgust I have at her method and technique.
Her method and her technique for dumping you?
- Exactly.
- Oh, okay, man.
Where is this letter?
- I' m calling your mom.
- Wait.
No, that is a scream for help.
I' m calling your mother.
It started out as a letter, then it evolved into a manual.
A manual on how to break up with a lover...... based on psychological and employee- termination research.
You' re telling me you don' t find any of this strange?
What' s strange, huh?
What' s strange about it?
When you break up with somebody, and firing somebody' s the same...... you wanna do it the easiest way without producing a stalker.
- I call it The Plan.
- The Plan?
The Plan.
It is brilliant.
You got a table of contents?
I don' t believe him.
"Committed or committable?
Time to kill.
Location, location. "
Why break up at her place?
You control the duration of the breakup, leave when you want.
A person can follow you if you' re at a bar, restaurant or hotel.
But ain' t nobody leaving their own apartment.
- And the answering machine?
- Change the outgoing message...... to the mechanical one because a breakup- ee will call the breakup- er...... just to hear their voice and then hang up.
I' m in Paris.... "
You see, to me, falling in love is blissful insanity.
But breaking up, that' s a rational act.
Now, how do we improve upon that rational act?
We do it through science.
What were you planning on doing with this?
I' m....
I got a betty I been seeing for three months.
Yeah.
What' s --?
Capricorn?
- Aries.
- Oh, yeah.
You wanna take this on a field test.
Quincy?
We' re gonna be rich, bro.
We are gonna be so incredibly rich.
How to dress.
How to act.
What to wear.
What not to wear.
All I' ve done is just research and realize that you can break up...... but improve on it by the science.
- That' s my boyfriend' s cousin there.
- Who' s that, honey?
The guy on TV, talking about the book he wrote on how to break up.
Not exactly leading us out of the Dark Ages, is he?
He' s kind of cute, though.
- What' s he like?
- I don' t know.
I never met him.
- But I know he is one lonely puppy.
- Why do you say that?
What woman would go out with a guy whose expertise is dumping people?
You got a point.
Okay, here we go.
What' s your love life like?
- Are you seeing anyone?
- Give me a second.
So, what do you want me to do?
Something drastic.
I' ve been seeing Evan for three months...... and I really like him, but he' s getting a bit twitchy.
You know how the fine ones are.
I think I need to shock him.
I need to shock myself.
I had that dream again.
- The one with the straps?
- No.
The one with Halle Berry.
- So....
- Dreaming of Halle before a haircut...... is as clear a sign you' re gonna get in this lifetime.
How does it feel to be in the building as an author and not a slave?
- I can wait by Philip' s office.
- I don' t want you to be lonely.
- Lonely?
- You gotta get out more...... because it' s depressing seeing you.
A fan wrote me a letter, said I was arrogant.
No, no.
Let me tell you something.
-... a humanitarian service to the world.
- No.
No, listen to me.
You should feel good about that.
How is anybody gonna find their one true love...... when they' re stuck in a bunch of dead- end relationships?
-... you are a love enabler.
- I just need somebody normal.
Oh, see, there you go.
There are no normal relationships.
You know why?
Because there are no normal women.
You know what?
A girl came to my crib.
Never seen her before.
- Says that she dug the book.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait.
A groupie.
Oh, my boy had his first groupie.
Groupies are there to please, okay.
They' re there to do whatever, whenever, however you want, kid.
- I couldn' t close the deal.
- Oh, Q!
Don' t tell me that, man.
Do you know what I' d do to get with a groupie?
lf it happens again, you can pretend you' re me.
I' m gonna do that.
I gotta meet up with Nicky later.
You wanna check her out?
- Nope.
How many weeks she got left?
- Technically, her time' s almost up.
- But she' s a little freaky.
So....
- You like her.
- No.
- You gazed into just midair.
- No, I....
- When you like people, you gaze.
All right, you know what it is?
She has this long, black, thick, sexy, sexy hair.
- Just got the weirdest pain in my nuts.
- I don' t want to be staring at that.
Anyway, you' d like her, Q. She does physical therapy at the hospital.
- You know, she' s bright.
- Mulatto?
- No, no.
A little cinnamon.
- Okay.
Bright like smart.
Yeah, bright like smart.
She' s tough.
She has body and that long, long, black hair.
Oh, shit, there it is again.
Boy, you are too old to be having the crabs.
You been putting that where you ain' t supposed to?
It' s a very social organ, but....
- Yo.
- He' s ready for you.
Okay.
All I' m saying is that one day a girl' s gonna dump you...... before you dump her.
It' s gonna have you very Eric Benét: sensitive.
- Don' t jinx me.
- I' m not jinxing you.
She' s gonna hide things from you.
The next thing you know, she' s gonna give you those fatal words:
"Baby, I think we need to talk."
- Respond to the door.
- Okay, fine.
I' m out.
- Twist it, respond, out.
- Need something from the clinic?
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Author, author.
Good to see you.
- King Author, baby.
King Author.
- What' s cracking?
- Well, yeah.
- Ready to do the second printing?
- Let' s get cracking.
- Publishing boys treating you right?
- Pretty decent.
That book is just the beginning too.
I' m seeing the whole line now of Spoil books.
Spoil' s Guide to Sex.
Spoil' s Guide to Golf.
- Spoil' s Guide to Pimping.
- I' m branding the whole damn world.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Guess you' re wondering why I asked you up here.
- Yeah, why am I here?
- Okay, just -- Why don' t you sit.
Let me just put it right out on the table.
I need your help.
- With what?
- Firing somebody.
Which is not the right word.
More "letting go," "getting rid of," "losing."
- Another employee?
- It' s my girlfriend.
You want me to help you fire your girl?
Well, no, if only you could.
No, no.
I' ve gotta do this myself.
I' m not gonna delegate this.
I would if I could, but I can' t.
It' s just...... l am at my wit' s end.
This woman -- God, she has a power over me.
Just a -- It' s like a voodoo, hoodoo, she do!
She' s got me.
I am -- I' m not in control.
No.
This is not me.
Hi, it' s Sandra.
You asked me to tell you if there was anything to know.
- Mr. Gascon has brought in a ringer.
- I need a professional.
- Breakup professional?
- Breakup professional.
- Me?
- You.
- Him.
- You' ve got to help me.
No, it' s a disaster.
My God.
Amy, I look like a bigheaded alien.
No, Evan' s gonna freak.
No, I don' t know what I did.
It' s ugly.
Oh, Jesus.
Would you stop with the "perfect couple" crap?
No, no, I don' t look like Halle Berry.
I look like her Yorkshire terrier.
Okay.
No, I gotta go.
Nicky.
- Nicky.
- I' m in the bedroom.
All right, come on.
We' re gonna be late.
- Did you hear me?
- I' m not coming out.
- What?
- Never.
I' m never coming out.
- What are you doing up there?
- Nothing.
You' re doing nothing in the bedroom?
- Yeah.
- And why are you never coming out?
- Because I' m hiding.
- And why are you hiding?
Baby, we need to talk.
Damn, he did jinx me.
Prepare yourself.
God.
Evan?
Hey, Evan?
Evan?
- What' s up, Q?
- What you doing here?
I was driving by and saw you had the lights on.
- That' s why I' m here.
- What' s with the hitting?
I knew it.
- I' m gonna whup your ass.
- You know what happened?
- What?
- She tried to break up with me.
- What?
"What?" She was being evasive and she was hiding...... and you know what she said to me?
"Baby, we need to talk."
- Yeah, that sounds familiar, don' t it?
- What did you say?
What do you mean?
I preempted the strike.
I ran.
You was gonna break up anyway.
I was gonna break up with her.
You feeling that?
I with her.
There' s a world of difference.
But it' s cool because I have a plan.
This the plan, okay?
I made plans to meet her at the Zig Zag at 9: 00.
- Oh, come on.
- So you' re gonna show up there.
You tell her I' m gonna be late.
You' re gonna talk me up.
Tell her what a great guy I am...... how cool it is for her to be with me.
Call me.
I take it from there.
- Where you gonna be?
- I' il be right here.
- Why you staying at my place?
- I can' t go home.
She' il find me there.
- Chapter 3.
- Chapter 3.
- You been reading.
- Come on.
That' s why you' re nervous.
Nicky?
- Maybe.
- Maybe not, huh?
What is your name?
Sorry.
- Okay, that' s the wrong name.
Excuse me.
Quincy.
Did you ask me my name?
- No.
- You didn' t just...?
- Okay, well, my name is Quincy.
- Okay.
- Mary.
- Mary, nice to meet you.
I was actually here because my cousin sent me to find his girlfriend.
She has long hair.
I never realized how many women...... in L. A. had long hair.
- Pretty smile.
No, not to my knowledge.
Maybe her description of you is more detailed than yours of her.
She doesn' t know me.
She thinks she' s coming to meet her boyfriend.
- But she' s not?
- No, no.
My cousin sent me because...... for some reason, he is terrified she' s gonna break up with him.
Why would he think that?
Because she wants to talk.
He ever think she' d wanna talk about something else?
You know women when they just want to talk.
You guys, when y' all wanna talk, y' all talk.
And y' all talking.
- Just talky- talk.
- We' re funny like that.
Really.
- What' d he expect you to do about it?
- He wants me to chat her up...... tell her how great of a guy he is.
- That' s really high- school.
- I said the same thing.
And the cold part is I gotta lie.
- He ain' t great.
- What do you mean?
He' s a misogynist.
He' s a player, you know?
And he has a three- month commitment clause.
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.
No, a firm policy.
- Sounds like a real peach.
- Even within the three months...... he messes with other girls anyway.
So I' m like, "What' s the deal?"
- Yeah, what is the deal?
- Enough.
Want a drink?
Yeah, a bloody mary.
Can I get a double, please?
Mary likes bloody marys.
That' s cute.
Yeah.
So, Quincy, what is it that you do?
- I am an editor for Spoil magazine.
- Really?
Wow.
You know, you remind me of someone.
- You remind me of somebody too.
- Really?
Halle Berry.
You got that.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
- Q.
- No- show.
- Damn.
That' s a sign, isn' t it?
- Like a flashing red light before a cliff.
Wanna go get something to drink, man?
I can' t, man.
I just met this babe.
We might go get some dinner and a club later.
I didn' t mention that I wrote the book.
ls that dishonest?
You' re on a date.
It' s all dishonest.
All right.
Strange.
You were gonna meet your date, I was gonna meet mine.
And we meet each other at the same time.
Strange.
- That' s not strange.
- No?
- No.
You wanna hear strange?
- Give me strange.
- Teratomas.
- That' s them little cookies?
- They come in a package?
- That' s tiramisu.
Teratomas.
They' re tumors that can grow inside our bodies...... formed by all three embryonic precursors.
- What does that mean?
- It means that they have hair...... and skin and glands, so they sweat like you are now, and brain tissue.
I saw one pulled out of a woman the size of a basketball.
And when they cut it open, she had a full row of teeth.
All the stuff that comes together to form human life are there.
But somehow they dissemble into something hideous.
It' s crazy.
So, what' s the strangest thing that you know?
Can' t bite through your own skin.
- What?
- It' s impossible.
First law of nature: self- preservation.
You can' t do it, because you' re selfish.
I can' t bite through my own flesh, because I' m too selfish?
- Try to.
- No.
- Bite into yourself.
- That' s lame.
- Bite yourself.
- All right.
You want some hot sauce?
I can' t bite into my skin, because I' m sane.
It' s the same thing, biologically speaking.
See, if you' re not selfish...... that means you' re crazy and you could do it.
What about if you care about someone more than you care about yourself?
First, why would you do that?
Second, are you talking about love?
Yeah.
Love.
lf someone is in love, therefore not selfish, then he or she is crazy...... and could bite through his or her own flesh.
So being in love and being crazy are one and the same?
It' s obvious.
- Wanna bite your other hand?
- No.
Wanna bite me?
I' m tender.
I' m moist.
I' m loving.
Hello.
Quincy Watson, I presume?
Yeah.
Yeah, that' s me.
Quincy.
Quincy Watson.
What' s up?
Come on.
- I' m Rita Monroe.
- Oh, yes, you are, Rita.
- That' s his way of saying hello.
- Oh, God.
"Hello, Rita."
- Drink?
- You do know why I' m here?
I do know.
Do --?
Do l --?
Do I know why?
One second.
- So you read my book?
- I' m familiar with it.
I' m also familiar with the fact that you plan...... on giving my Philip breakup pointers.
Not a very good idea.
I' m completely....
Everyone has a job, and mine is to become Mrs. Philip Gascon.
I' m sorry.
You were saying?
I' m saying that I think we need to work some things out.
One professional to another.
- Professional?
- Don' t be under any illusions.
It' s not all love.
It' s not love.
I think I understand now.
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
I wasn' t expecting you to be so --
- What?
So honest?
- Straightforward.
There' s no need for us to work against each other on this.
- You wanna talk compensation?
Very direct.
- Was I too fast for you?
- No.
I' m just used to placating...... scared little rabbits, you know?
I' m not used to doing business with a real man.
I need to find an ATM.
Oh, what the hell?
- Look at the town drunk.
- Where am l?
You' re in my living room.
What kind of man corrupts another man' s dog?
- You see a woman around?
- You that freaky...... you need help to get a dog drunk?
What you do to the dog?
I' m gonna report you.
It' s not your dog, it' s your ex' s.
lf Helen came home now and saw an alcoholic pug, what would she say?
You can' t let pugs drink, they' re not rottweilers.
- They got little- bitty kidneys.
- Helen' s not coming back.
It ain' t about Helen.
No.
And it' s definitely not about the dog.
I don' t know what kind of freaky stuff -- You got my drawers on?
Mr. Lynch, I' ve told you...... don' t take your clothes off for therapy.
Hold my dick.
Okay.
I' il come back when you get dressed.
Dr. Jacobs, call 2035.
Evan called.
One o' clock, your place.
A little afternoon delight?
Oh, he' s so romantic.
You guys are the reason I date.
He' s freaking out.
- Are you?
- No, or I wasn' t.
Then I went on a date with Quincy, who thinks I' m Mary.
And found out that if true, Evan is Satan.
Not that Quincy' s reliable, given he lied about...... what he does or did in writing that book.
But he did seem sincere, and there' s the craziest freaking attraction that' s --
Oh, God.
So I guess the answer' s yes.
- Yes, what?
- I' m dumping Evan' s ass for lunch.
- Hey.
- You' re late.
- What are we doing way out here?
- Spies.
I don' t think you fully realize the seriousness of the situation I' m in.
I got techniques for you so good you will never worry about this girl again.
Now, what' s the plan?
Early supper, maybe a DVD back at my place.
Can we get the DVD at her place?
- Her place.
Now, what do I say?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
- It' s what you do.
- Well, what do I do?
- You sulk.
Pardon?
And then eventually, she will ask you....
- What' s wrong?
- Then you will respond by saying...... nothing.
Come on, come on.
- Honey, something must be wrong.
- No, nothing.
- Something is obviously wrong.
- No, it' s nothing.
Tell me.
Please tell me what' s bothering you.
Now you got her.
She' s desperate.
Hit her right between the eyes.
Well, if you must know, I wanna break up.
Wait a second.
Just like that?
I call it the passive- aggressive bullet to the head.
She feels responsible.
Then eventually, she' il squeak out, "But why?"
And then you just look right in her eyes and say, "Hey, I don' t love you."
And then you bounce.
Wow.
Well, it sounds a bit cruel.
It' s less cruel than a bad relationship.
Now, I' m gonna give you these.
Okay?
That reminds you who you are.
You' re hard metal.
You' re steel.
I still don' t know why we couldn' t go to your place.
I like the smell of new paint.
- Drink?
- No, thank you.
You look like you swallowed a spider.
I didn' t just swallow a spider.
- A rat?
- No.
- Wanna know what it is?
- What you swallowed?
- Why I am sulking?
- It just looks like you' re constipated.
No.
I explained to you that I was sulking.
Because you' re constipated.
- When was the last movement?
- It' s not about that.
- You want to know what it' s about?
- No.
- Well, why not?
- Because you look so cute.
There' s something on my mind.
Something you should know.
Philip, rub my leg.
I have a cramp.
Don' t you wanna know what' s on my mind?
Rub my leg first.
Higher.
Higher.
What' s on your mind, big boy?
Let' s go.
It' s open.
- You cut your hair.
- I know.
No, but I mean, like, you really cut your hair.
I mean, you look like that actress.
- Halle Berry.
- No, not Halle Berry, please.
No.
The actress in that movie about the crack addicts.
- That' s who you look like.
- Like a crackhead?
-... that' s one hell of a cut.
- So, what, you like it?
No, I hate it.
That' s good.
It makes it so much easier.
- I wanna break up.
- What?
Yeah.
"What?" I wanna break up.
You can' t break up with me.
I' m supposed to break up with your ass.
Well....
Apparently not.
This is so unfair.
This is so completely like you, just totally contrary.
Okay, but why you yelling?
Because you wanted to break up with me.
Yesterday you wanted to have "the talk." Remember?
I didn' t want to break up.
You thought I did.
Oh, no.
No, no.
Okay.
I saw the sulk.
- You were sulking when I came in.
- That wasn' t a sulk.
It was too a sulk.
Your forehead looked like a walnut.
- I saw it.
- Okay, today, I was sulking.
- Yesterday, total misread.
- Today, today.
What?
- About the talking.
- So why' d you cut the hair?
- To keep you, dumb- ass.
- This is too confusing.
I' m out.
Be gone, nigga.
I don' t care.
Who' s keeping you?
You' re real indignant, considering you stood me up.
I did not.
You stood me up.
It' s good.
I' m leaving.
But you stood me up.
You practically forced me to go out on a date with another guy.
What?
Yeah.
- What other guy?
- Whoever I was out with, obviously.
- Where' d you go?
- Where we were at.
Now you fronting.
You a comedian now?
It' s good, because I' m up out of here.
How long you been seeing this guy?
You know what?
That' s no longer any of your business, now, is it?
- Did you do it?
- No, not really.
- You' re still together?
- No, he dumped me.
He dumped you?
Wow.
- He' s good.
- Too good.
It doesn' t make sense.
You were perfect.
- You should get married.
- It makes perfect sense.
His best friend shows up, acts like he doesn' t know who I am.
Talks smack about Evan to get me all angry, knows all these great lines...... and then lies about what he does.
"And what does he do?" you ask.
He masterminds breakups.
It' s obvious.
- It is?
- They did the old bait and switch.
Evan handed me off to Quincy, like:
"I' d slap that ass.
You give it a try. "
No.
What are you gonna do about it?
Quincy doesn' t know that I know.
He doesn' t see that I see the connection with Evan.
That I know about that stupid book he wrote.
That' s fine and dandy.
I' il keep our little date tonight.
Take him down the old romance path.
When he leans in to kiss me, that first awkward kiss of the evening...
- Yeah. -... l pull back and laugh.
I' il dump his ass so hard he' il be using a walker.
What?
- It sounds a little childish.
- It is not.
Okay.
Maybe Evan will realize how much he' s in love with you...... and then you can suggest couple' s counseling or....
It' s time for my rounds.
We' il talk later.
Lay back, Mr. Lynch.
Q.
- What you doing here?
- Just helping Philip.
Forget about Philip.
Your boy got problems.
- I know that.
- You ready for this?
- I' m in love.
- That' s what you said.
No, no.
That was lust.
That was just bump and grinding...... talking- dirty- while - I' m- spanking- that- ass lust.
This --
- This is love.
It' s Nicky.
- Right.
- I broke up with her today.
- Strange way to show your love.
I wasn' t in love with her when I did it, okay?
At least...... l didn' t think I was.
Was I in love with her when I did it?
No.
It wasn' t until she told me she was seeing another guy.
That' s what it is.
- That' s jealousy.
That ain' t love.
- Think so?
Of course it' s jealousy, that' s what I' m saying.
Why would I be jealous if I wasn' t in love?
- Because we trip like that sometimes.
- I think I made a big mistake.
I don' t know what to do.
What you think I should do?
Buy her something.
Diamond rings, clothes.
- Here we go.
You' re no help.
- Credit card.
I need to find the dude, stick my foot up his ass.
He might be big.
Might whup your ass.
You know, if it wasn' t for that stupid haircut that she had....
- She cut her hair?
- Cut her hair.
Can you believe --?
Women know that' s an aggressive act towards men.
Women cut their hair, it' s aggression.
She aggressed me.
- No long hair?
- No long hair.
Thinks she look like Halle Berry.
Come on.
Halle Be --
You know, it' s --
- What' s wrong with you?
- Nothing.
I was bubbling.
I ate some of those taquitos...... that they had out in the front.
No, I need to go.
Where' s a --?
I' m gonna go to the bathroom.
Nicky?
So, Mary.
- ls that short for Marilyn?
- No.
Actually, it' s not.
So why don' t you tell me more about your job as an editor.
Actually, you know what I' m trying to do?
I' m trying to write a book.
- Like a children' s book.
- Of course, a book.
It' s called All Dogs Leave L. A.
Because they can' t get any attention or any love.
- Where do they go?
- Compton.
Whatever happened to your sleazy friend and his longhaired girlfriend?
- They broke up.
- How' s he taking that?
- Feels like he made a big mistake.
- Does he?
Yeah, they say that honesty is the most important element in love.
Oh, I don' t believe that.
I think it' s the most important element in a relationship, but love...... doesn' t care about it one way or the other.
What does it care about?
ltself.
Who the hell do you think you are?
We had a deal.
- Gotta be a wrong number.
- Safe word: rabbit.
- Grow up.
Listen, Mr. Watson, if you want more than sex, then damn it, just speak up.
But double- dealing?
Totally unacceptable.
You call me back.
These things are pinching me.
I swear, I don' t know who it is.
They gotta have a wrong number.
- I don' t know who it is.
- I' m out.
Some other Quincy.
Yo, wait, baby.
- Look, I swear I don' t know who -- - Oh, you swear what?
That you' re honest and forthright?
ls that what you swear?
Mostly, yeah.
Get all you need, bro.
Get all you need.
She took the day off.
But if there' s anything I could do for you....
- Will she be here tomorrow?
- I don' t think so.
I been calling.
She hasn' t called back.
- You have the nicest eyes.
- Thanks.
ls there something else I can help you with?
I like your hat.
I' m so confused.
- Me too.
- What should I do, Mr. Lynch?
Love me.
And hold your dick, right?
Okay.
- ls he gone?
- Yep.
- Finally.
- I think he' s really, really sorry.
Shouldn' t you give him a chance?
- I don' t know.
- You two belong together.
How about it?
lf you hate this girl so much, why can' t you break up with her?
It' s called fear.
Don' t get me wrong...... she has many fine qualities: beautiful, fun, smart....
But after a point, you get this feeling of bottomless ruthlessness.
So tell me, you wicked little animal...... what is Philip offering?
You tell me.
Nothing.
Stinko.
Zip.
Book payback.
- Book?
- Tit for tat.
I can give you tit and tit.
- Philip Gascon?
- But you decide.
You helping Philip break up with me, or are you helping me marry him?
- Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
- What is it?
I got a cramp.
- Where?
- It' s in my leg.
Well, I' il help you rub it.
- Here?
- Yeah, right there.
That' s where the cramp is.
You' re not even listening to me.
Hello, Philip?
- Where you at?
- Sorry.
Look, if something isn' t done soon, I' il be married.
So why you wanna marry Philip?
Quincy, Quincy, Quincy.
I' m a practical girl.
I was brought up dirt- poor, wrong side of Toledo, by not a very loving family.
I' ve put together a life for myself based on good looks and street savvy.
I figure another five to seven years to cash in.
It' s really all quite simple.
I mean, even the book is theoretical.
Just....
Don' t fall in love.
That' s the main thing.
Don' t fall in love.
It' s dangerous.
Somebody could get hurt.
- Do you love Philip?
- No.
I like him.
He' s nice.
He' s a likable guy.
But women don' t love men they can manipulate.
What about a man that can manipulate you?
Well, if I find one...... l' m sure I' il fall in love.
You need to break up with her in public.
Do it at the post office, airport.
Banks are good.
Where there' s security.
But you gotta come on with the come on.
- You got to be assertive.
- I know, I' ve gotta be assertive here.
Yeah.
Got to get you --
I didn' t tell you about the face.
- What?
- You know about the face?
- No.
- The face of immutability.
That' s where you drain all the emotion off your face, like this here:
See?
You don' t show emotion, hard for a person to be emotional with you.
This breaks the cycle of facial expressions.
It gives off pain, anger and hurt.
- Yeah, keep that.
Keep that.
Keep that.
- Yeah.
Now, when you see her, you act, you don' t wait.
You say, "It' s over."
Philip.
- What' s wrong with you?
I want to break up.
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, I want to break up.
- Here?
- Yes, here.
Why here?
To avoid violence.
ln a post office?
Philip, it' s not you.
I know you.
- You' re a FedEx man.
- Yeah, whatever.
- Well, it' s not possible.
- Why not?
- Because we' re getting engaged.
- The hell we are.
Look, I thought it all through...... and it is the best thing to do.
It is the most generous thing to do.
I don' t want to be generous.
Honey, I' m being generous, not you.
Listen, let' s face facts, Philip.
You are an aging, boring white guy.
Without me to define you, you' re invisible.
So in good conscience, the loving person that I am...... l could not really just let you go.
- I just wanna break up.
- Of course you do.
Listen, we' il get a bottle of wine and you can tell me all about it.
Okay?
Come on.
Come on.
Buck up.
Rufus, my darling.
How' s my little baby?
Rufus, it' s me.
Helen.
You stop that.
You have something to say to me?
- Yeah.
- What?
You ever hear of this game, the question game?
- No.
- It' s real simple.
It' s where you ask me a question, I have to answer it truthfully.
I ask you a question, and you have to answer it truthfully.
- Sounds slightly mean and dangerous.
- No.
How about I start it out?
What' s your name again?
Mary?
Nicky.
- Your turn.
- Okay.
What do you do?
I was an editor at Spoil magazine.
Then I wrote this handbook on how to break up with your lover.
- How long have you known that?
- First night at the bar.
How long have you known that my name wasn' t Mary?
- Yesterday.
- So you didn' t know that first night?
Hold on.
Why' d you go out with me?
Because you thought I looked like Halle Berry.
- Who was that woman on the phone?
- I don' t know.
No girlfriend in the shadows with a frying pan?
Nope.
None of that.
Do you love Evan?
I thought I did.
Once you knew who I was, you planned to stop seeing me?
I can' t do that.
That' s my cousin.
It' s not right.
- But here you are.
- Here we are.
Why is that?
I' m crazy.
- How crazy?
- I' m crazy like:
Not a drop of blood.
What' s a girl to think?
I' m bleeding internally.
Wait, wait.
Wait, Quincy, wait.
Wait.
Maybe we shouldn' t, Quincy.
- Why?
- You know why.
Yeah.
You' re right.
You' re right.
I gotta talk to him.
Yeah. lf we have wild sex tonight, it would only complicate things.
Yeah, yeah.
It would.
I' m tripping.
I' m gonna go talk to him.
You know what?
Maybe I should just go.
- You wanna go?
- You want me to?
- Not unless you want to.
- I don' t.
- Don' t go.
- Then why you bring it up?
- We could play a game.
- Naked Twister.
- No, I have a better game.
- Really?
- The fantasy game.
- The fantasy game.
- You sit over there.
I' il be over here.
- All right.
You tell me one of your favorite fantasies.
And I' il tell you one of mine.
- You can go first.
- Okay.
There' s these baby chickens...... and they' re all oiled up.
You go first.
I gotta work mine out.
Okay.
I' m asleep...... in this...... deep, beautiful sleep.
This stranger, he comes into my bedroom.
And his lips....
-... like a Now and Later.
- Grape?
- Grape.
- Yeah, grape.
And then his lips are slowly...... moving down my body from my neck...... to my breasts...... to my belly.
I just can barely catch my breath and....
Oh, this -- It' s like a slow...... enormous explosion and --
Get off.
What are you doing?
What? l -- The dream and the lips.
It was a fantasy.
- Oh, my....
- God.
You got me excited.
I....
I was feeling....
- Oh, what the hell.
Oh, God.
- Yeah.
Didn' t work out, did it?
Somehow it turned into a negotiation.
We started out far apart.
I wanted to break up, she wanted to get engaged.
ln the end, we forged a compromise.
- What was the compromise?
- We got engaged.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- So you still want to break up?
- More than ever.
You know I believe in straightforward honesty and direct dealings?
I have deep respect for your philosophy.
Damn all that.
We gonna write a letter.
The letter states you' ve broken up.
Hell, I' il even write it.
All right?
After that, all you do is change your phone numbers, answering machine.
Take a vacation for two weeks, somewhere exotic only you know of.
Don' t you wanna be somewhere so you can be naked...... run on the beach, have fun and frolic?
Frolic all you want, then come back and you change up.
Change your habits.
Change your schedule for about...... six months.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Well, I can do that.
- Run naked somewhere, can' t you?
I' ve got an ass, and I' m gonna show it.
lf it' s what you want.
I don' t wanna see it.
Show your ass.
Okay, let' s see some ass.
- Don' t get naked right here.
- I can just run away!
All right.
All right, man.
You scaring me.
You scar -- You are scaring me.
Evan.
This cousin of yours is a genius.
Don' t forget to give me that letter.
About 7: 00?
All right.
- Adios.
- What you give him?
- I need to holler at you.
- Got something to show you.
- Watch your eyes.
Watch your eyes.
- Nicky?
- Who else?
- Thought you broke it off.
Q, the deeper the hole, the bigger the romantic gesture to crawl out of it.
And this is a big gesture.
- You think she' s interested?
- I know.
- How you know?
- I know.
- Her friend told me.
- No, she didn' t.
- She did.
- Her dude?
She' s just using some loser to get to me, the real prize.
- You think he' s a loser?
- I know he is.
I don' t believe that.
That she' d choose that.
Believe it.
I know Nicky, right?
I see where she' s going with this.
She likes little games, and I play along.
- Some games kind of kinky, right?
- Oh, man.
- Why you doing this?
- I love the woman, that' s why.
- You don' t think it' s a good idea?
- No.
Set you up.
I knew you' d say that.
You' re about being safe and in control.
And this....
- This is crazy, right?
- When?
The master plan goes down tonight.
I' m so brilliant.
How you doing?
I' m looking for Nicky Callas.
I' m a good fiend of hers, Quincy Watson.
You know, she' s out for a few hours, but why don' t you leave a message.
Sure.
Can you tell me where she went?
No.
No idea.
Make sure she gets this.
This is important.
- Okay?
- Of course.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Still on for tonight, aren' t we?
- Sure.
- Nicky.
- No, it' s Philip.
Are you bringing that letter over yet?
- Yeah, I' m coming.
- Thank you, muchacho.
Surprise!
Well, I couldn' t rush off to paradise without celebrating a second printing.
Ladies and gentlemen, Quincy Watson, author.
There he is, bigtime, bigtime.
Hey, I got a surprise for you.
It' s in the back.
- You ain' t seen Philip' s girl, have you?
- I doubt she was invited.
- Good, good.
- Yeah.
- I thought you had to meet Nicky.
- It' s being arranged.
Trust me, boy.
No, hey, trust me.
Have I ever let you down?
Have I ever let you down?
- Hello, Quincy.
- Helen?
Yeah.
What you doing here?
I' m back.
- Whose party is this?
- A friend' s.
- I wanted to go to the movies.
- Don' t be such a drag.
It' il be fun.
It took me going away to realize...... that it wasn' t you who needed to change...... it was me.
You' re perfect just...... the way you are.
But I would do anything to make it right again between us.
Amy, what have you done?
Oh, my God.
I' m gonna close my eyes now.
And you can either kiss me or slap me.
I don' t care.
Excuse me.
Q.
I need to speak to you for a minute.
Now.
Oh, don' t go.
Nicky' s here.
Yeah, yeah.
And Rita' s here too.
- What?
- Oh, it' s a long story, okay?
But I need you to go get Nicky and bring her back here to me.
- I' il tell you how to recognize her.
- I know, short hair.
- I don' t see Evan anywhere.
- I can' t believe you did this to me.
- I' m leaving.
- No, no, no.
He' s changed.
Okay, it was supposed to be a surprise, but he has a ring.
- A ring of what?
- A diamond ring, silly.
You' re psychotic.
Really psychotic.
- Well, that' s harsh.
- Excuse me.
- Nicky.
Hey, what' s up?
- Quincy.
- You know what?
Let' s get out of here.
- Yeah.
I was thinking we' d bounce, get a little --
You know, have you seen the floors?
These floors are great.
- Who' s that woman waving?
- She' s looking at you.
Have you got the letter?
- Right here.
- Okay, Nicky.
Cool.
- You didn' t tell him?
Tell me what?
- That' s the girl.
- Hi.
- Let' s blow out these candles.
- Yeah.
I think I' il mingle.
Hello, I' m Helen, Quincy' s muse.
I' m Nicky, Quincy' s girlfriend.
I' m Rita.
I just screw him.
- Yo, Evan, I' ve been seeing Nicky.
- What?
I wanted you to know me and Nicky been seeing each other.
- My Nicky?
- You know, I don' t --
Look, I' ve been seeing Nicky, and I love her.
Hey, just met your muse and your little ho.
You know what you are?
You' re a walking, talking teratoma.
No, Nicky, Nicky.
Wait.
Yo, Nick!
E!
Wait!
E, E, hold up, man.
Look, it' s not what you think.
I think you weren' t thinking.
- I didn' t know what -- - I don' t give a damn.
You don' t do that to blood.
You don' t do that to family.
You know the rules.
Yeah, I know you know.
Go to hell, man.
I' m gonna get her back, Q.
Stay away from her.
Dude.
Going somewhere?
Yeah, just a business trip.
You know, kind of a last- minute thing...... to London, just --
Yeah, just --
- Well, the hotel pool, you know?
- You' re allergic to chlorine.
- Not that bad.
- You stop breathing.
- Yeah.
The key broke off inside the....
- But it....
- ls this letter addressed to me?
Perhaps you should just read it.
There' s something I need to tell you, but it may change your opinion of me.
I' m having an affair.
Famous Q.
What you doing, and how' d you get in?
- I broke a window.
- Why you do that?
- Your little dog is very friendly.
- What are you doing here?
Yo.
What' s your problem, man?
Oh, damn.
What the hell is wrong with you, man?
- Yo, Philip, I' m confused.
- You certainly are, because I know.
- You know what?
- Rita told me about your indiscretions.
He bit me.
That animal.
The way I listened to you.
The way I confided in you.
- It wasn' t me, I swear.
- Listen, ungrateful little misanthrope.
lf you so much as look at Rita, I will hire people to break you in two.
Plus, I' m pulling your lousy book.
Your self- help days are history.
I' m gonna marry that girl, and there' s not...... a damn thing you can do to stop me.
Yeah, it' s just....
Yeah.
Stop that.
What?
This?
Fine.
Here.
Don' t you threaten me.
I want that thing put down.
There won' t be fights in here.
But if you do, keep that left up.
- Then uppercut and a round -- - Can I help you?
Yeah, I was wondering...... if I left my girlfriend' s dog here, could you find him a good home?
- Come with me.
- All right.
There you go.
Got your own condo, skylights, Jacuzzi.
You gonna have mad freaks up in here.
Yeah, they all get three days, but between me and you...... ain' t none of them get out of here alive.
Let me know.
- Honey, I' m home.
- Are you crazy?!
- Get that thing away.
- Where my dogs at?
God, it' s so ugly.
Fly back to Paris on this.
Go get her, boys.
- Nicky?
- The person you' re calling...... is unavailable.
- Yo, E, I gotta talk to you.
- Wait a minute.
Before you start, I have something I wanna say.
- I' m getting married.
- No.
Oh, yeah.
No date yet, but it' s going down.
- You happy?
- Of course.
It' s a big day, but --
And that' s just good because you know why?
- I want you to be my best man.
- No, I can' t.
- Hey, Q. We go back.
- No, I can' t.
I' m serious.
- She' s here.
- She' s here.
She' s here?
For what?
No.
Quincy, this is Rita.
Rita, Quincy.
Pleasure finally meeting you.
Heard a lot about you.
You have no idea.
- Yeah, what happened to Philip?
- Heart attack.
What do you think?
So pretty, isn' t it?
Thankfully, it turned out to be a fairly minor incident.
But he needed to spend a few days in the hospital.
So there I was, nursing the poor soul back to life when who walks in?
Oh, hey, is that the Angler contract you got there?
- Yeah, you know, I' il come back.
- No, just put it down.
- Right here?
- Yeah, just here.
Here is good.
I' m sorry.
Where are my manners?
Evan, this is Rita Monroe.
Rita Monroe, Evan Fields.
Of course, I didn' t know he was Evan.
I thought he was you.
I felt so used, so manipulated that I just...... fell in love.
- ls Philip still in the hospital?
- No, I fixed him up with this nurse.
- Good boy.
- He' s in good hands.
Rita, will you excuse us for a second?
I' il see you outside.
- What' s crackulating?
- Talk to Nicky?
Oh, no.
Well, I stalked her for a while, but that was a long time ago.
- That' s a joke.
That' s a joke.
- Good.
Rita, nice to meet you.
Q.
You still need my permission if you wanna talk to her.
Them the rules.
I got my own rules now, player.
I can' t believe he hit you in the ear.
They deserve each other.
Hello?
- Hey, where' s Nicky?
- She' s not here.
- When is she coming back?
- She' s not.
- What you mean, "she' s not"?
- She' s gone to Portland.
- Portland?
- You just missed her.
She took the train.
He' s afraid to fly.
He?
Who the hell is he?
Right here, Mr. Lynch.
Don' t move.
Your daughter doesn' t pay me enough...... to play hide- and- seek with you.
All right?
I' m gonna go get the tickets.
Stay here.
Damn.
Hi, two tickets on the Surfliner to Portland.
Come on.
Damn.
Nick.
Nicky.
- His right hand grabbed me like this.
- I see.
Okay, we gotta go.
We gotta go now.
Let' s go.
Please have your tickets ready.
Final destination for this train is San Diego.
What?
Don' t even think about it.
What the...?
Oh, my gosh.
Quincy.
- What are you doing?
- I' m a --
- It' s my fault.
I' m an idiot.
- What are you --?
I don' t understand what you' re saying.
Do you hear me?
What you with the old dude for?
I can' t understand what you' re saying.
I' m a misanthrope.
I' m an asshole.
I' m a fool.
- I can' t hear you.
- I love you.
I got to have you.
What are you --?
No, no, no.
No, no.
No, don' t.
- Crazy man.
- Don' t, don' t.
No, no, don' t.
Don' t.
Oh, my God!
Stay here.
The essence of life isn' t comic.
It' s tragic.
There' s nothing intrinsically funny about the terrible facts of human existence.
I disagree.
Philosophers call it absurd because, in the end, all you can do is laugh.
Human aspirations are so ludicrous and irrational.
I mean, if the underlying reality of our being was tragic, my plays would make more than yours, because my stories would resonate more profoundly with the human soul.
No, no.
Tragedy confronts.
Comedy escapes.
Look, you guys, what are we discussing here?
Is there a deeper reality in comedy or tragedy?
Who can make such ajudgment?
Look, let me tell you a story and you tell me, is it material for a comedy or a tragedy?
This happened to some people I know.
It' s a small dinner party.
The hosts are trying to impress one of their guests.
Suddenly the doorbell rings and out of nowhere an unexpected person shows up.
- A man or a woman?
- A woman.
I' il give you the details and you tell me comedy or tragedy.
So, the guest enters and everyone is surprised, especially the host.
Turns out she' s got a particular problem...
My God, that' s quite amusing.
I mean, she barges in unannounced while they' re eating.
What you told us would make a very good romantic comedy.
- Because you see the world comically.
- You' re missing the tragic implications.
The entanglement it suggests.
No, I see the whole thing quite differently.
I see this lone figure - a woman who' s maybe just come off a bus.
She' s toting a suitcase.
Maybe she' s searching nervously for an address.
Hello?
Who is it?
- Can I help you, miss?
- The Springers.
Top floor.
- It' s really good.
- These speakers are wonderful.
You do pick up every little nuance of the orchestra.
Tell me again why I can' t have a glass of wine?
Every pregnancy, she asks the same question.
This is the "Concerto in D".
Yes.
My God, you really know your Stravinsky.
This would be good theme music for the play.
- Lee?
- That' s a brilliant idea.
I need a little help with the final touches.
- Can you get the two big serving dishes?
- I' m running out of obsequious banter.
- How' s it going?
- He thinks I' m perfect for the part.
The goddamn producer wants more of a name.
I don' t understand why they make such a big deal.
It' s not like it' s the lead.
My first audition went better.
I don' t know what happened.
- And I know it' s not the lead, Laurel.
- Doesn' t he have any clout?
They want a name.
I' m not a name.
You didn' t marry a name.
- Sally said how much she loves your place.
- How long are you here?
Six months, and we' re still not finished.
We have to furnish slowly cos we used up all our money.
We could not go on in that one- bedroom.
The piano ate up the living room.
I get nervous.
Laurel is certain God will provide.
- They' re poor, but happy.
- Definitely poor.
- What do you do, Peter?
- I' m a lawyer.
No jokes, please.
Think the music' s a little too loud?
You should have seen her.
She was listening to Mahler with tears streaming down her face.
She looked so beautiful.
I wanted to hug her.
But I had to get up early and film a deodorant commercial.
That' s work at least, right?
I think someone rang before.
Did you hear?
- So, how do you all know each other?
- We grew up together, Cassie and I.
We were those little girls at school with the plaid skirts.
- And Lee and I met at Northwestern.
- He was the star actor, the handsome athlete.
Everybody wanted him.
But Laurel got him.
- Hi.
- Hi, Melinda, hi.
- My goodness.
God.
Cassie.
I' m stunned.
Here, let me take these.
God, look at you.
You look so...
Don' t say what you' re thinking of.
I' ve been on a Greyhound bus since Tuesday, so I' m sure I look like the wreck of the Hesperus.
A bus from where?
I mean, what are you doing here?
I' ve moved around.
I had to keep moving.
Events unfolded in such a way that...
Is it all right if I smoke?
I just feel a little nervous barging in on you like this.
Why don' t you sit down and eat with us?
This is Jack and Sally Oliver.
- Hi.
I' m Melinda Robicheaux.
I' ve gone back to my mother' s name.
It' s French.
She was Parisienne.
You must have dropped off the goddamn moon.
- Shall I get a chair?
- I could use a drink.
Champagne or white wine.
The truth is, I' ve gotten very used to single malt Scotch.
An acquaintance of mine introduced me to it, so...
I really should freshen up, though.
If I could just get a single malt Scotch, and...
Look at me.
I need a hot shower.
Yeah.
OK, please...
Excuse us.
Please start.
This is so unexpected.
I' il say.
- You had no hint she was coming?
- She was nuts then, and she' s nuts now.
- Did you see the look in her eyes?
- She' s been on a bus.
You were asking how we know each other.
We went to school together.
- Yeah.
She' s had personal difficulties.
I can' t remember, Chicago or Indiana, and could we put her up?
Laurel said, "Sure." I myself...
This is not the time to discuss this.
Let' s just eat and change the subject.
We' ve all had friends drop in unannounced.
Remember your aunt?
I fix up the room for her.
She doesn' t show when she says she will.
So we try to contact her and there' s no trace of her.
Two months later, she calls up unannounced in the middle of a frigging dinner party.
- Am I unreasonable?
- No, no!
You' re missing the whole point.
You have the makings of a delightful human comedy here.
You missed the humour in everything.
I see a sweet, tree- lined block on the Upper East Side.
It' s a dinner party.
The husband is fawning over his guest.
He' s a moviemaker.
No, wait.
Here' s the idea.
Make the film director the wife.
He' s just her out- of- work actor husband.
She' s trying to impress the guest and raise the money for an independent film.
I just told Jennifer that Steve is interested in investing in Susan' s next movie.
Yeah.
I have most of the money.
I' ve just been trying to get it going now for two years.
I liked your first picture.
Would you do this one on video too?
No.
That was just because we only had $300, 000.
- This one will be on 35mm for sure.
- Well, how much do you need?
I' ve raised about four million and we need another two million.
The problem is the theme is controversial.
- What' s the theme?
It' s a mostly all- female cast and it' s called The Castration Sonata.
- Do you happen to have single malt Scotch?
- You know, let me check.
- Hurry.
I' m running out of obsequious banter.
Everything' s timed.
Chilean sea bass and caramelised filo is not like scrambled eggs.
Well, he happens to love it.
Does he love it $2 million worth?
God, I hope so.
I told you we should keep single malt Scotch.
- Who drinks it?
- He does.
God, you' re definitely going all out.
You' re dressed very sexy.
- OK, OK, OK.
She goes down to buy a bottle of single malt Scotch.
Are you OK?
Yeah, I' m fine.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Here we go.
These are Coquilles St Jacques with cinnamon.
And we' re having sea bass in a caramelised filo pastry, lightly dusted with lime powder.
- Did someone send you a yuppie cookbook?
- Susan says you' re a wonderful chef.
I' m an out- of- work actor.
Who' s that?
- Hi.
I hope I' m not intruding.
No, it' s OK.
I' ve been having a kind of bad time and I just took some sleeping pills.
- Sleeping pills?
- How many?
- 28.
- Whoa!
Call 911.
Sit.
Just stay and eat.
It' s OK.
- OK, OK.
- Vodka?
It' s OK.
I just need something to calm my nerves.
- Do you live in this building?
- I' ve been subletting for a month.
- Somebody call a doctor.
- Careful.
- I' m gonna be sick.
- That' s the best thing.
No, no, not on the carpet.
Go to the bathroom.
Can you smell smoke?
God!
The Chilean sea bass lightly dusted with lime!
Should you be taking those pills?
You didn' t have any dinner.
If I don' t, I can' t sleep.
Well, Cassie' s put on weight, not that I' d ever say anything to her.
- Cassie' s pregnant.
- Again?
They swear they' re stopping at three children.
For me, two was just the right number.
- No, there' s none.
There' s nothing.
Now, I don' t want you to get panicky, but I am planning on staying.
Just for a while.
I just need to find a place and settle in and rebuild my career.
And you did say that you had enough room to put me up.
We had everything ready.
Lee had gotten your room in order.
I apologise for that.
I was going through a kind of confused down period.
I was worried.
Lee couldn' t figure out how to get in contact with you.
I' d no idea you were using different names.
What happened?
I thought the worst was over.
- Can I speak openly?
- Of course.
I tried to commit suicide.
You didn' t.
I did, and it wasn' t a half- hearted attempt.
It wasn' t a cry for help.
Why?
I thought you' d pulled yourself together.
Because that' s what I wrote you, and some days I honestly thought it.
But in the end, I just couldn' t take it any more.
You didn' t find me because I was indisposed.
If you' ve never been in a state mental hospital in a straitjacket, I wouldn' t recommend one, especially not the one I was in, in the Midwest.
I' m overwhelmed.
I mean...
I' m on the road back.
I' m still a little fragile when everything closes in, but I get stronger every day.
You know you' re welcome to stay here as long as you like.
- There.
How long is she gonna stay?
- Why?
We promised my sister could stay for Thanksgiving.
- Well, Thanksgiving' s not for a while.
- Well, I' m just saying.
- She' s trying to pull her life back together.
- She' s her own worst enemy.
- You don' t know the details.
What details?
She was married to some doctor.
She had two kids.
What was she doing playing around with...
What was he?
He was a photographer.
Melinda.
Lee' s right.
Whatever I went through, I' m responsible for.
Look, we' ve all been drinking and we' re really tired.
No, he' s right.
I was married to a man who loved me and gave me the two most beautiful children.
That I' m not allowed to set eyes on them is just proof of my weakness and my husband' s strength.
No.
It' s disgusting how much influence he had on the judge.
Life is all networking.
I brought it on myself because I was bored.
I mean, not bored with my children.
God, they were the light of my life.
But I was bored being a doctor' s wife, just as my mother was bored being a doctor' s wife.
Like Madame Bovary.
It' s not that St Louis isn' t very beautiful.
It' s just that everything that had seemed so magical when I married Josh somehow just melted away.
It was OK, you know?
And no matter what I did, I couldn' t make it any better.
And then this man with a romantic name -
John San Giuliano - took my photograph.
And I fell in love with him, and we began having this love affair.
And he wanted to know if I could see myself living in Italy, and I said, "Well, look, Mr San Giuliano, I' m married to a surgeon with two children."
"My life is fixed, so don' t ask me to tax my imagination."
"Let' s just confine our passion to local motels and forget Capistrano."
And then reality set in in the person of a private detective with the unlikely name of Woodkrutch, and my children were handed over to my humiliated husband forever.
Mr San Giuliano took me on a safari to help me forget things.
But I can' t forget, no matter how hard I try.
Then he met someone else.
Stop, Melinda.
Why?
It only gets worse.
So that' s pretty much how I got here.
My God, that' s a sad story.
Guy leads her on, causes her to break up her marriage, then dumps her.
I caught him in bed with one of his models.
I mean, who can blame him?
She was a 6ft Swede who was a Miss World runner- up.
Her legs started at her chin.
See, that' s why my film, The Castration Sonata, puts male sexuality in perspective.
It' s lucky you didn' t have children.
He could have made custody trouble.
I always wanted to have children, but my husband wouldn' t hear of it.
He couldn' t bear having sex with a pregnant woman for nine months, especially the fat months.
- So, what are you gonna do now?
- I' m an art historian.
At least, that' s what I majored in at Brandeis.
And I may be getting offered ajob in an art gallery.
It' s only cataloguing, but I' m in no position to turn it down.
Anyone for more Ants Climb a Tree before I throw it out?
- I can' t eat another bite.
- Dinner was delicious.
Sorry about burning the sea bass and the kitchen curtains.
- I' m sorry about busting in on you.
- No, no.
We love it when unexpected women barge in and throw up.
I' m kidding.
I hope tonight didn' t kill my chances of getting my movie made.
No, no.
I think Steve Walsh was OK.
I told him I was gonna play a male character in the movie.
- What did he say?
- We discussed acting.
I told him about my award- winning Pygmalion.
- Hobie, that was in college.
- It was brilliant to play Henry with a limp.
After you' ve made your own film?
Sad thing is, he could have my movie happen like that.
What' s $2 million to a real- estate billionaire?
The upkeep of his private jet is worth more than that.
He was very impressed with you, and you looked very sexy.
You thought I looked sexy?
- You are sexy.
Really, you' re very sexy.
- Hobie, it' s 2am.
- What' s going on?
We used to make love all the time, and now there' s always an excuse.
I' m going through an emotionally difficult time creatively.
- You feel we don' t communicate?
- Of course we do.
Can we not talk about it?
Hi.
Sorry I' m late.
I saw these the other day.
I think they would look very beautiful on you.
He gets crazy about my spending.
You' re not hurting for cash?
He' s on tenterhooks about the play, but we' re fine.
He' s got a number of irons on the fire, some promising possibilities.
- I have a very good prospect for Melinda.
- Ajob prospect?
A guy.
- Remember Bud Silverglide?
Have I met him?
Remember we had Thanksgiving at my house and he brought his little girl Emily?
- Emily...
- His wife had died the year before.
Yes.
He' s average- looking.
He' s fine.
He' d be perfect.
He' s a very lovely guy.
He' s been through his share of suffering.
Melinda would have a ready- made family.
You think he' s right for her?
I remember him as pleasant, but...
She should be so lucky.
He' s got a very successful dental practice in Manhattan.
He plays bridge.
He likes to hike.
Think he' d be interested in Melinda, especially when her past unfolds?
She' s in no bargaining position when all the facts come out.
Look, I can only bring them together.
He' s not the kind of guy who' d ever wind up hurting her.
That means a lot.
Left to her own devices, Melinda can be self- destructive.
Bud is sweet, and I know he' s lonely because he' s taken ads in the personal columns.
Don' t tell Melinda that.
Peter' s checking into her custody case to see if it' s a lost cause.
I told her to meet us here for lunch after herjob interview.
- Should we sit?
Can we take this table?
Thanks.
I know it' s here somewhere.
We got this house guest living here.
I wish she would check before she moves my possessions.
I love your loft.
It' s really amazing.
Here we are.
An essay on Desdemona' s role in Othello.
The scene you should do in our next class is the one we talked about yesterday.
- You really think I' m ready for it?
- I do.
You' re among the two or three most talented students in my class, and the sooner you challenge yourself, the better.
You' re the only one who makes me feel confident enough to take chances.
Aren' t you nervous bringing me back here?
It' s OK.
My wife' s shopping, then going to lunch.
She' s always shopping and lunching.
She grew up shopping and lunching.
Her mother did, and her grandmother.
You shouldn' t really drink so early in the day.
Shopping and lunching' s what you get when you marry a Park Avenue princess.
- What does your wife do?
- Besides shopping?
She teaches tin- eared teenagers at a music school a few days a week.
It' s funny, but life has a malicious way of dealing with great potential.
My God.
Get...
Hi.
I just got back from my job interview.
I don' t think it went too well, so just stopped off for a little pick- me- up.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I' m gonna go and meet Laurel and Cassie for lunch in our old neighbourhood.
I' m just gonna go freshen up.
- The park hasn' t changed a bit.
- Not at all.
It brings back so many memories.
Those days are gone when the three of us thought we could call the shots.
What I wouldn' t give to wake up and find my life has been a bad dream and we' re all still 17.
Tell me about it.
You wouldn' t change anything.
I mean, your life is pretty much on track, right?
Well, the question' s not fair.
I mean, who wouldn' t profit from a second go around?
So, what about Bud Silverglide?
The dentist with the charming little daughter?
He' s a wonderful guy.
If anything ever did happen and you hit it off, you could establish something solid.
Not more unrealistic pipe dreams that can' t help but wind up badly.
I' m sorry.
Did that come out harsh?
The truth is, I' m nervous.
I wanna meet someone so desperately, but when the chance comes along, I just panic.
It won' t be a date.
I' il make a dinner party and we' il all be there to support you.
I' il invite a number of nice guests and he' il be one of them, and if you meet and hit if off, then great, and if not, then no obligation.
When he hears my story...
I come with such baggage.
- Well, don' t go in with a defeatist attitude.
First see if you even like him.
If he' s as nice as Cassie' s painting him...
He' s a good catch, if I can speak pragmatically, especially for you, cos he' s got his feet on the ground.
If I find him at all attractive, I think I should just tell him my whole story right off.
Or do you think it' s better to wait?
Let him take the hook first, and then run with it?
God.
I can' t believe I' m even asking this.
I' m already strategising.
I haven' t met this guy yet.
If we' re gonna do this, it has to be completely informal, cos I can' t handle it any other way.
I don' t have any dressy clothes anyhow.
Funny part of that is, as elegant as I can look - and you know, I can look pretty stylish - men find women sexier in casual attire.
It' s true.
I could wear my hair down and loose.
That' s enticing already.
At least it' s not intimidating.
- You haven' t told him anything about me?
- I can if you like.
My sad tale should come from my lips, if and when I choose to reveal it.
OK, great.
That was great.
It was great.
You took the note great.
You got it?
OK, hey, everybody, that' s lunch.
Thank you.
- Hey, are you gonnajoin us?
I' m meeting a friend.
Tell the actors we' re gonna do scene ten instead of 26.
OK.
We' re doing scene ten instead of 26.
- Hey.
- Should we just sit here?
- Yeah.
- So, what did he say?
- That Steve is inclined to put up the money.
He likes your script and wants to have lunch with you.
- Fantastic!
- Yeah, it looks really good.
He was concerned that you intended for Hobie to play the psychiatrist.
- You know, he wants a name.
- I understand.
It' s gonna be kind of a touchy subject at home because, I mean, the truth is he' d make the perfect shrink, and he knows it.
But, let' s face it, he' s not a name, and I want people to see my movie too, so...
Well, I' m sure that you guys will figure it out, and I think it' s very exciting.
Doug and I know somebody perfect for Melinda, your downstairs neighbour who crashed dinner.
- Remember Greg Earlinger?
- No.
- Doug' s dentist.
You met him with us once.
He has a great sports car.
The Bentley.
He' s single and available.
She would find him fascinating.
He' s smart, sensitive...
Why would he be interested in her?
She seemed quite pretty, she' s offbeat and Greg always likes complicated women.
Doug has already hyped him on her.
Ask her if we can give him her number, OK?
- Hey.
- Melinda.
- Hi.
Hi.
This is Melinda.
She just moved in.
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you.
- How' s it going?
- All right.
I just interviewed for ajob at an art gallery and I don' t think it went too well.
You never know.
I had a voice- over audition today.
Thought I' d never get it.
Bang, I was chosen.
It' s the voice of a toothpaste.
That' s good.
I' m trying to decide whether to stay and wait for the phone call or whether I should go out and treat myself to a movie.
Why don' t you come with us?
- Where?
- Going to the track.
- To the track?
Horse races.
Belmont.
- What, you play the horses?
- Never.
He' s a gambling degenerate.
- Yes.
Can' t you tell I' m a degenerate?
- I' m a complete novice, like you.
Come on.
It' s a beautiful day.
We' il have some laughs.
- Sure.
I don' t have any money.
- I' ve got plenty of money.
For both of us.
We' il pool our resources.
- If you want.
Yeah.
- Nice to meet you again.
Come on, Bedazzled!
- Let' s go, Bedazzled.
No, no.
You did not bet on Bedazzled.
It' s a 90- 1 horse!
- If it wins, we' re rich.
He' s dropping back.
He' s second.
He' s second... second from last.
So, I have to ask you, how' d you go from living on the Upper East Side to St Louis?
I moved there for him.
He was gorgeous.
He was talented, he was sexy, he was a doctor, he was charming...
Yes, but where' s the attraction?
- He just knew how to touch me.
- You mean emotionally?
No, with his hands.
I' m a very passionate person, so sex is very important to me.
You know, I need a lot of physical intimacy very often and creatively.
Right, right, right, right.
Yeah.
- Am I being too frank?
- No, no, no.
No, I just...
I' il be OK.
I get hot flashes.
- Your wife is passionate.
I can tell by looking.
- Right, right.
A lot of people have noticed.
Why did your marriage fail again?
He was cheating with his secretary.
I felt neglected, so I started seeing someone else.
I just wanna find someone, fall in love and have a life.
- Hello.
Guess what?
- What?
- Steve is putting up the money for my film.
That' s great.
Congratulations.
So if I' m suddenly very busy and distracted, don' t take it personally.
- And we have to talk about casting.
- Yes.
- What did you do today?
- I told you.
I went out to the track.
Yeah.
With who again?
With who?
With me, with me.
With me... me and Walt.
Walt Wagner.
- Well, I hope you didn' t lose a lot.
- No.
We don' t have a lot, so I couldn' t.
In fact, if I had more money, we could' ve lost more.
It' s a system I developed.
Why didn' t you just tell her Melinda came along?
- What did you just say about Melinda?
No.
I didn' t say anything about Melinda.
- You just muttered her name.
- I was wondering how the poor thing' s doing.
You know, plain- looking girl, all alone...
- Well...
Jennifer wants to set her up with someone.
We met him once.
He' s a tall, sexy, handsome- looking guy.
The Bentley.
Very well off.
Charming, bright.
- You commented on how impressive he was.
- Vaguely.
- Yeah, I think...
Why, I do recall him.
Wasn' t he full of himself, though?
Kind of an unjustified self- confidence?
- As I recall, it was justified.
- Someone who has an answer for everything.
I' m gonna ask Melinda if it' s OK if we give him her number.
No, don' t be silly.
What does she wanna do with a dentist?
She was already married to a doctor.
She found that dull.
- Greg' s not dull.
He hikes.
He' s a great bridge player.
He goes on safaris.
Well, it...
I mean, who goes on safaris?
- You need shots to do that.
- Melinda, hey, it' s Susan.
How are you?
Good.
I was wondering if it was OK with you if we give your number to this wonderful guy.
I' m not giving the number out.
Don' t say that I am...
He' s a very rich dentist.
He' s gorgeous- looking.
And...
There' s nothing to be nervous about.
Look, we' il all go out, the four of us.
We' il go to dinner or we' il go to a show or something.
I don' t think you' il be sorry.
- I think she' s never, ever gonna go for it.
- OK, great.
- Not in a million years.
OK, bye.
- She loves the idea.
- I told you.
Hi.
What are you doing down here?
I got the part!
The director kept insisting and the producers finally gave in.
- That' s great, Lee.
- Finally, a role I can make sing.
You' re certainly a natural for the character.
- Why would you say that?
- You' ve said it a hundred times.
I said I could act the hell out of it.
He' s a loser.
I meant nobody can play the part like you can.
I' m asking.
Is that how you see me?
I' m really happy for you.
Can' t we leave it at that?
I didn' t mean to seem snappish.
Shall we go out to dinner and celebrate?
- Tonight' s Cassie' s party.
- Yeah, right.
Jesus.
It' s time Melinda met someone, moved on.
I' d like a little privacy in the apartment.
I' ve got a couple of options.
I could wear...
I can wear this skirt with this shirt, like this.
This goes around the other way, like this, and I could wear it with this shirt here.
- What do you think?
- The silk one is sexier, but this one' s elegant.
You think the silk one' s sexier?
Sex works best in the end.
Men like to feel there' s some hot payoff waiting for 'em somewhere down the track.
- God, look at me.
- Fat?
Melinda, everyone should be so fat.
I didn' t eat anything since Friday.
I wanted to lose six pounds.
It' s not healthy.
I mean, an empty stomach and all those pills, and...
I don' t know.
Maybe this is better.
Maybe sex is too predatory a message to send, and elegance is a wiser opening gambit.
I don' t think it matters much.
You look great.
Doesn' t she?
Very stylish.
I can' t lose any weight.
I think I need another drink.
Alcohol' s fattening.
- Can you make it a vodka?
- Plus an empty stomach with pills?
Vodka' s not fattening.
I need something to calm me down, just to make me a little more confident.
- I' ve got goddamn circles under my eyes.
- You look fine.
That' s easy for you to say because you' re still beautiful.
I feel like I' m running on empty.
Honestly, I don' t wanna go to this thing.
Come on.
It' s just a little party with friends.
How did I wind up desperate?
Because that' s what I am, Laurel.
There' s no other word.
You really are.
Falling in love is gonna work wonders for you.
- Congratulations.
I hear Lee got that part.
- We' re very excited.
No one at school played the classics like Lee.
They still talk about the Strindberg series.
He' s held himself back from commercial work because he' s got such high standards.
- Yeah.
I knew that director would have his way, and he wanted you.
My agent' il bring film people to the opening cos there' s talk of a project in California.
I' d drink to your good fortune, but vodka' s not good for Samantha.
It' s gonna be a girl.
- No?
- No.
It always struck me as so erotic - doing it with your big belly.
Peter says it' s just like screwing any fat person.
I don' t suppose he' d lend you out to me so I could satisfy a lifelong lustful curiosity?
Why don' t you get Laurel pregnant?
Then you wouldn' t need to make arrangements.
Maybe if things work out now, we can start to think about it.
I always wanted to have kids.
Knock her up, then you can make love to her in all the trimesters.
If you knew how much I wanted to do it with you, you' d do itjust out of human kindness.
Too late.
Ball was in your court years ago.
You ran in another direction.
How' s our matchmaking going?
They seem to be hitting it off well.
Peter, what' s it like to sleep with a pregnant woman?
Have you ever made love with a loser at Weight Watchers?
Didn' t I tell you?
The great thing about hiking is you' re free.
You feel free.
You' re up there in the mountains or in the woods, and it' s beautiful.
Almost religious.
And I am not religious.
Certainly not after Dorothy passed away.
That must have been really tough on your daughter.
She' s four.
I just don' t want her to be angry at God or against religion.
I want her to be happy and educate herself and make her own decisions about the big questions.
I' d love to call you.
Maybe we could spend some time getting to know one another.
I know you just returned to New York, but it' s really changed.
I' d be glad to show you around.
To tell you the truth, Bud, I don' t really think I' m ready to go out yet.
I don' t think it would be fair to you.
Maybe when I' m a little more settled.
Sure.
At your leisure.
I understand.
Jesus.
Emily' s with a new sitter tonight and, of course, I' m a basket case.
- That' s very sweet.
- Would you excuse me?
Laurel, you know this one.
Play.
- I can' t.
He plays so beautifully.
Come on.
Come on.
Take over.
You' re wonderful.
I didn' t mean to interrupt.
I' m just gonna get a drink.
That' s OK.
I was just rubbing this lamp, hoping to change my life.
Well, I believe in magic.
In the end, I think it' s the only thing that can save us.
- You' re the piano player.
- Not any more.
I' m on a break.
I must say, she plays beautifully.
Hey.
Are your eyes misting over?
This song, it' s meaningful to me.
It was playing the night I met someone.
So are they tears of sorrow or tears ofjoy?
Well, aren' t those the same tears?
Why do things that start off so promisingly always have a way of ending up in the dump?
- Not for everyone.
- Well, for anybody with any imagination.
You know, life is manageable enough if you keep your hopes modest.
The minute you allow yourself sweet dreams you run the risk of them crashing down.
There' s plenty of old songs that I cry over.
My name is Melinda.
Melinda Robicheaux.
It' s French.
- That' s a very beautiful name.
- Thank you.
It' s my mother' s.
She married a Dr Nash, so I grew up Nash, but I' ve changed it to her name.
And that is a wise choice.
It' s very musical.
My name is Ellis Moonsong.
I am from Harlem, USA.
Ellis Moonsong.
Is that really your name?
Yes, it is.
Let' s go and sit down.
It' s wonderful.
You also play beautifully.
Well, one thing I could always do was make music.
I can play all the instruments, but my specialty is composition.
I' ve written two operas.
One was done at Yale, I' m proud to say successfully, and the other one is being done in Santa Fe next summer.
- Very impressive.
- Yeah, listen to me brag.
I' m insecure, so I sell myself.
The truth is, not everybody likes the music.
They' re kind of modern, but the critics were extremely supportive.
Is that what you wanna be - another Verdi or Puccini?
I don' t kid myself, you know, but, yeah.
If I could rub that lamp and have my wish...
Operas, symphonies, string quartets.
There' s a lot of interest in my work in Europe.
I might go to Barcelona or to Paris to live.
God, I can' t stop gushing about myself.
You' ve opened Pandora' s box.
And you?
I don' t write opera, but my life has been one.
I' m one of those heroines too high- strung for existence on this planet, although I brought my worst troubles on myself.
I shouldn' t have reached so thoughtlessly for my dreams.
We grab without thinking because we' re passionate people.
I knew you were passionate once we started talking.
- How?
- How?
Well, your eyes, your voice.
I got a great instinct about people.
It' s a gift.
Let me get right to the point.
Can I get to know you better?
I gotta go back and play, but could we have lunch, you know, or dinner?
You can certainly have my number, if that' s what you' re asking.
Let me...
I' il just get a pen.
There you are.
- I saw Mr Bud Silverglide.
- The mystery pianist.
Mr Moonsong, Ellis Moonsong, this is Laurel.
Laurel?
I dated a Laurel.
She broke my heart.
I wrote this piece of music and I dedicated it to her hoping it would win her back.
- Let me be the first to tell you, it did not.
- He composes serious music.
You two should have a lot to discuss cos Laurel gave concerts.
Those days vanished with the lost chord.
His opera was a big success at Yale and they' re doing the other one where?
At the Santa Fe Opera House.
It' s great when it' s stretched out in front of you.
Well, I wish I was as optimistic as you.
- Well, I' il call you tomorrow.
- I' m busy tomorrow.
- What' s tomorrow?
- Well, then, I' il call you the day after.
If you feel like it.
What happened with you and the swell dentist?
He was very, very sweet.
Very cute.
Butjust not for me.
But Ellis Moonsong is very poetic.
Things are amazing.
You meet a stranger, and in a sudden rush, you' re thinking to yourself, "Could I live in Barcelona?"
Be careful.
I mean, you can' t go through life rubbing lamps and wishing.
It doesn' t work.
Take it from me.
Hey.
Greg Earlinger.
Hi.
- Greg Earlinger.
- I' m Susan.
We' ve met.
- This is Melinda.
- Yes, wow.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- So, this is Hobie.
- You' re the gynaecologist.
- Close.
- Dentist.
Dentist.
What were you thinking?
- I love it at this time of year.
It' s so beautiful.
- It' s nice when it' s so bright, huh?
You know, it' s really sexy, isn' t it?
- You look a little carsick.
Cos I' m the colour of guacamole?
This is going well.
Look how happy she looks.
I wish we could afford a pad in the Hamptons.
Everybody who' s anybody has one.
But if you' re somebody who' s nobody, it' s no fun to be around anybody who' s everybody.
Isn' t he charming?
And don' t tell me he' s not gorgeous.
If you like perfect features.
Don' t be such a crab.
I' m gonna try to come out here more often.
- Wow, it' s so big.
- Thank you.
It' s so clean, too.
It' s a great place to entertain, which I love.
- God, Hobie, isn' t it amazing?
- Yeah, I love the ramp.
That' s important out here.
Go in.
- Thanks.
It' s tremendous for aerobics.
Come on, try it, Hobie.
What do you do for exercise?
Tiddlywinks.
And an occasional anxiety attack.
- Try it, Hobie.
It' s good manners.
- Since when do I have good manners?
- What is that?
Is it a pig?
- I don' t know.
Hey, Greg, did you shoot this?
Well, actually, I shot all of those.
Twice a year I go to Africa.
The experience would take your breath away.
Huge herds of kudu - greater kudu and lesser kudu.
- Which is bigger?
- Hobie!
I think it would be the sexiest thing to sleep under the stars in the middle of the jungle...
If you don' t mind waking up with a python in your sleeping bag.
The whole thing is very civilised.
They have beds and bathrooms and showers.
But no elevators.
- I' d have to take the elevator.
- I don' t understand.
- Did you shoot all the furniture?
- So, Melinda, have you ever shot a gun?
Freshly shot?
- Right here?
- That' s fine.
Thank you.
- Are you sure you' il be all right?
- I' m fine.
- A drink!
Yeah, we could do that.
- We can' t.
You have to get up early.
I' m out of work.
Hey, do you have any tequila?
I make the world' s most potent margarita.
- They' re very strong.
- I sure do.
- Are you all right?
- Here, can I help you?
You know this car so well.
- He' s like an old man.
- Thank you.
- I' m fine.
It' s like we' re dancing.
- Tequila' s on the surgeon general' s list.
- Just be quiet.
Why' d he stop twice to get the car washed?
God, he' s incredible, isn' t he?
It' d be great for Melinda if things worked out.
I wouldn' t let that guy fill my teeth.
I mean, anyone who gets his jollies putting holes in animals...
The Ernest Hemingway of the root canal set.
He' s probably got her in bed by now.
I didn' t think she could stand him.
Not every woman falls for that phoney social rap, you know, with the Haut- Brion and special cheeses and backgammon trophy.
Someone must blow him up with an air hose.
Can we just not discuss it?
And, frankly, I thought you acted like a clown.
Now, can I talk to you for a minute?
And try not to get upset.
What?
You wanna spend more time in the Hamptons whether I go with you or not?
I told you Steve Walsh is gonna co- produce my film.
Yes, that' s fantastic.
I figured out a great way to play the psychiatrist.
With a limp.
I do a great limp, and that will account for his crushing insecurity.
That way, when I make a pass at Rosalie, I expect the rejection.
You won' t be able to play the shrink.
- Why not?
- Steve wants a name.
- I have a name on my driver' s licence.
- He won' t go with an unknown.
- You' re the director.
- Without him, there' s no film.
But I' m the perfect psychiatrist.
You said it.
I think I can find something else for you in the script.
- Like what?
- What about Moe Flanders?
You' re more Flanders than you are the shrink.
The retarded elevator operator with the cleft palate?
- Is that how you see me?
- When have I said you had a cleft palate?
- Help!
- My God.
That' s Melinda.
He' s raping her.
Probably put Novocaine in her margarita.
Help!
- What is it?
What' s wrong?
There' s a tick in my leg.
- Where' s Greg?
He doesn' t do tick extractions.
His beeper went off.
He had some kind of emergency.
Someone saw a rhino on Sixth Avenue and they needed a hunter.
- Get it out!
Please!
In the Bronx we had mice.
You can' t pull it out cos the body comes out and the head stays in.
I think I' m gonna faint.
- Take her to the emergency room.
- There' s a tick inside me sucking my blood!
- It' s not sucking your blood.
But this is disgusting enough.
I' m so sorry.
It was so nice of you to come and hang with me.
That' s OK.
Actually, I love watching a live creature being pulled out of somebody' s body at 3. 30am.
- If that happens again, please call me.
- It was really nice of you - this whole day.
It' s obvious you don' t care much for the beach.
It' s not the beach so much as the ocean, the sand and the seagulls and things like that.
Well, go.
Rest.
Call me.
I' m over here if you need me.
But try not to panic.
The screaming frightened me.
And you would be totally cool if you had a live insect crawling around under your skin?
I wouldn' t enjoy it, but I wouldn' t panic.
That' s good because there' s one in the back of your neck.
- My neck?
- My neck?
- Yes.
Right here.
It' s OK.
- Get it off!
Get it off me!
OK.
This is exciting.
I' ve never been to the races before.
Here' s a horse called Broadway Melody.
I think that' s a lucky name.
Well, it' s not very sensible to pick horses by their names, but I guess it' s romantic.
That was so beautiful.
There is no more sublime music than that second movement.
Laurel cannot listen without crying.
Her eyes are all red.
I' m with her.
When Raphael first laid eyes upon the Sistine Chapel he passed out.
- Aren' t you gonna find us a taxi?
- Yeah, let' s go.
She' s head over heels in love with him.
He is unfazed by the details of her past.
He is, in fact, moved by her suffering.
Even the awful story she' s been reluctant to tell but feels that she must.
I killed him.
But it was an accident.
In my defence, I will say I was out of my mind on drugs.
I shouldn' t say drugs.
Pills.
Pills to help me sleep at night, pills to keep me awake, whatever I could get my hands on to sweep my various pains and anxieties under the rug.
But if I' m honest about it, I did mean to do it.
I denied it in the trial, of course.
But the fact is, I...
I couldn' t think of what else to do.
I thought about killing myself.
Why I didn' t, I can' t say.
It would have been much more rational.
I thought about killing his girlfriend.
Maryanne was her name.
Maryanne Lane.
And it was...
It was so easy buying a gun.
I just drove out of state and I walked into a store and I bought one.
There were no questions asked.
I bought a box of bullets and I loaded it like I' d been handling one my whole life.
It was all very premeditated, despite what my attorneys would have everyone believe.
And then I drove back to where he worked.
It was next to a Christian Science reading room.
I remember that.
And I just waited out the front for him to come out.
And even that wasn' t very difficult.
There was a slight drizzle, I remember that, but the wait wasn' t interminable.
And then when he came out and walked to his car, I simply confronted him.
And he said some very cold and cruel things to me, and I shot Mr San Giuliano
as I had planned to.
As I had planned.
Well, they must have felt the circumstances were extenuating if you got off so lightly.
It may seem lightly to you, but it was nothing but hell.
And if you' ve never been arrested and put on trial, well, that alone is sentence enough.
The horror, the... the tension, the police, the journalists...
I went over my story hundreds of times - the jilted mother, seduced away from her family, sick on drugs, the struggle for the gun, the gun goes off.
But there was no struggle.
That was legal fiction.
Well, you had good lawyers.
Not like your child custody team.
I rememberjust lying in my cell at night and thinking,
"You are Melinda Nash from Park Avenue."
"What the hell are you doing in a women' s prison in illinois?"
So, naturally, after I got out I decided to end it all.
What do you want?
I want to want to live.
Everybody wants to live.
Now that I met you, I' m feeling a little more positive about it.
Congratulate me.
I just got canned.
My version differs from theirs.
They would have you believe I couldn' t hold my liquor, which anyone who knows me knows is a baseless canard.
Lee, I knew this would happen.
You did?
Well, why didn' t you tell me?
I' m angry and disgusted.
I mean, Christ, can you blame them?
Thank you for the emotional support.
I' il see you around.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- You all right?
You seem a little glum.
- Lee got fired.
What happened?
It was the producer.
They' d always wanted a name.
- They got nervous cos ticket sales were slow.
- I' m sorry.
- I know the realities of the marketplace.
So, what are you gonna do?
I don' t know if I should feel sorry for myself or shop to blot out my depression.
Come with us.
- With you?
Sure.
I' m taking Melinda to a recording session.
Bartók.
- No...
- It' il take your mind off things.
They' re doing a quartet.
- You remembered?
- Come on.
- Do I have time to change?
- You look fine.
Look at me.
I' ve been working all day.
- All right, but hurry, then we' il get a coffee.
- It' s beautiful, isn' t it?
- They' re so good.
The result is I play them both badly.
- And the viola.
- I heard you play the piano.
You' re good.
- No.
- Yes.
Full of feeling.
You have a lovely touch of the keys.
I can.
- You saw my soul?
Right off the bat.
That first party, when you sat down next to me to play, the minute you touched the keys the chord went through me like a knife.
I don' t dare ask you what you saw.
It' s great.
Although I find the more turbulent parts a little scary.
- He' s still not home.
- Come to dinner with us.
- No, I can' t.
- Come on.
It' s gonna be fun.
We' il go down to this little bistro downtown west.
It' s very quiet, very dark, very French.
- You' il love it.
I' ve fallen in love there.
No more for me.
- Melinda was the fast, advanced one.
- Come on.
All the men were crazy for her.
Her unpredictability.
No, Laurel was the star of our group.
I remember how jealous everyone was when you married Lee.
Lee was the most attractive, most charismatic actor.
My God.
You almost broke Cassie' s heart, not that she' d ever admit it.
Forgive me.
Am I being too open here?
It' s just I feel great.
- What is this?
- It' s a Haut- Brion.
My head is swimming.
But it feels good.
You were the first one in our group to sleep with a man.
You were so very sophisticated.
I did.
- Yeah, well, it was probably true.
- I had a deep hunger for physical intimacy.
- A hunger that could not be denied.
Not once adolescence descended and the hormones kicked in.
Melinda had a reputation for being postmodern in bed.
Life is short.
That was a sobering discovery I made when my mother killed herself.
Short, and not about anything except what you can touch and what touches you.
Whereas I...
I' ve only made love with one man in my life.
Lee was the first and Lee was the whole story ever since.
That' s perfect.
No, I mean it.
I think there' s something almost mystical about two people who only know each other.
And, really, you' re both very alike.
You know, you' re both very, very passionate women.
You' re poured into one person, and you' ve wanted to live out different experiences.
- Is that you?
- No.
No, I think it' s me.
So, I got a message.
That was Peter.
I think he' s got some news about my children.
- Would you excuse me for a minute?
- Yeah, go ahead.
I was determined not to ask you what you saw when you looked right through to my soul when we met.
But I wanna know.
Something very clouded and protective, with lots of longing.
Wow, there was a great longing in the notes you played.
It took you a much shorter time.
You sat down and pressed the keyboard, and I thought, "Who is this lovely creature with the melancholy touch on the keyboard?"
Then I saw your wedding ring, and I thought, you know, story of my life.
Is that the story of your life?
Well, it' s the main chapters.
My first impression was, he' s handsome, he' s lost, he' s got inscrutable eyes...
Melinda would like him.
Speaking of Melinda.
I don' t dare say this, but it looks hopeful.
God.
I almost wish this opportunity hadn' t come up, you know.
I just don' t know if I can handle the tension.
I mean...
- It will.
You have to think positively.
She' s right.
You were correct when you said that life is short and not about anything, but one thing I do know is that we were not put on this Earth to be dragged all the time.
We should go.
I was hoping that you could come by my class one afternoon and lecture the students.
- It would be so meaningful to them.
- I' d love to.
I just hope I' m not a better lecturer than a composer.
- You' re home.
- I' m sorry, Laurel.
I really messed things up.
Yes, well, you really have to get a handle on your drinking.
Yes.
And I will.
Of course, now the boat sailed.
- Made you some dinner.
- I ate.
Where were you?
I had some late meetings at school.
- I don' t know what to do.
- And you' re sure?
- Yes.
It was there in his talk, in his eyes.
- And you flirted back?
Yes.
I was outta control, letting him know I was there for him.
God.
Poor Melinda.
I don' t wanna hear about poor Melinda.
Other people' s lives are falling apart.
Peter and I suspected it was not going well with Lee.
Does everyone?
Am I gossiped about?
God, that poor girl.
I' m not gonna do anything.
- You already have.
Peter and I can help.
No.
I' m not gonna be the pathetic single friend getting introduced to some dentist.
You' re gonna act on this.
I see it.
I can' t stop thinking about Melinda.
She just knocked on our door carrying her neurosis in her arms.
- Come on.
You' re married.
I know.
I' m consumed with guilt.
I dream of myself kissing Melinda.
- Then I' m on trial at Nuremberg.
- How does Melinda feel?
I haven' t been able to tell her that.
The subject of infidelity' s out of the question.
- You don' t know if she feels the same?
- No, I think she does.
I just haven' t had a chance to pursue it.
My marriage has been on the decline for a long time.
We hardly ever sleep together.
The last time we did Susan just lay there staring into the darkness as if her parents had been killed in a fire.
Well, why can' t you just tell her it' s not working any more?
I don' t wanna hurt her.
I couldn' t fire my podiatrist who operated on my wrong foot.
Maybe you should go back to your shrink.
He' d just recommend Prozac.
I think he has stock in the company.
- Maybe you' re using Susan as an excuse.
- No.
Yes.
Maybe you don' t even really wanna do it.
No, cos if there was a button I could push to be with Melinda but not hurt Susan, I' d do it.
How wise is it to get involved with a woman with Melinda' s track record?
That' s why I' m convinced I' m in love with her, because there' s no logical reason to be.
- Be a man.
- I don' t know...
That' s what you have to do!
She' il live, you' il live.
I heard her say that she likes Art Deco -
- take her out, confess your feelings.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
That' s the way.
- This is gonna crush Susan.
How you doin '?
The Deco pin there.
- How much is that?
- That' s $150.
- Could you giftwrap that for me?
- Yes, of course.
I wish I could be with Melinda without hurting my wife.
- Hobie, what are you doing here?
- Now, don' t get upset.
Hobie, I think you should know that Steve and I have become attracted to one another.
- You have?
- If you punch me in the nose, I' d understand.
He came here to be with me while I told you.
I just...
Try to understand.
I do.
Wait.
You do understand?
I do.
Most definitely.
You' re having an affair with Steve Walsh.
He' s wonderful.
He' s clever.
He' s smart.
He' s fabulously wealthy.
I know.
I just want you to know I don' t want anything.
I know how tough your work has been for you, and we' ve decided Steve is just gonna help with all the legal expenses, and I just want everything to be as painless and as civilised as possible.
You know, I think that we can always be friends.
Melinda.
Hobie.
Can you meet me for a few minutes?
There' s something I' m dying to tell you when you get off work.
You know that little French bistro on the corner of Tenth Avenue?
The little candlelightjoint, near where you work.
Are you sure you should be drinking so much without having any lunch?
Well, we worked through lunch.
I was doing a voice- over commercial.
It' s not what I envisioned when I was at Northwestern.
They still talk about my portrayal of King Lear.
I played it with a limp.
How are you liking the job at the gallery?
Well, my boss is great.
- She has amazing taste.
- Good.
I mean, it' s not a very high- paying job, but it' s fantastic cos I have plenty of time to think about what I wanna do with my life.
Well, I' m glad you said that.
God, you look very pretty in this candlelight.
I' m sure anyone would look amazing with all this flickering shadows and all the wine you' re drinking.
Right.
Well, I' m drinking because life moves so fast.
So unpredictably.
You know, it' s over so fast and in the end, what is it?
Chekhov said a soap bubble.
Did I tell you I played Uncle Vanya once?
With a limp.
It was interesting.
You know, it' s funny that you should say "unpredictable", because I was walking home yesterday.
I have to tell you this story.
So, some people were moving into an apartment on 90th Street.
And they were moving this piano, so there was this piano just, you know, sitting in the middle of the sidewalk.
And I couldn' t resist the temptation just to go up and give it a little tinkle.
I play a little piano.
I used to play in high school.
I actually gave some concerts.
Anyway, I' m playing this piano.
I' m playing this little tune that my mother taught me.
And this... this guy came up and started talking to me.
- Hi.
That' s good.
- You play the melody.
- All right.
Is that what you' re trying for?
- Exactly.
- Good.
So, his name is Billy Wheeler, and he' s a piano player.
And he also writes pretty music.
And he walked me back to my apartment and he invited me out on a date.
I think I' m in love.
- In love?
- Well, I mean, I' m exaggerating, of course, but some bell definitely went off.
- A bell?
- One of those bells that now and then rings, as Mr Cole Porter put it.
So, anyway, I just thought that you would be pleased to know.
So, what is it that you wanted to tell me?
I don' t...
It doesn' t matter.
OK.
This situation is perfect - he' s despondent, he' s desperate, he' s suicidal.
All the comic elements are in place.
Now she' s going out with Billy Wheeler, and Hobie' s the single upstairs neighbour.
Now she' s fixing him up.
We must know somebody for Hobie.
- The woman who owns your art gallery?
- Phoebe' s married.
I don' t need to meet anyone.
I' m fine just staying in my room and...
And what?
Moping?
Get out and reinvest your emotion.
Don' t indulge your depression.
- Hey.
Stacey Fox.
Why not?
- Who?
She recently broke up with some Wall Street guy.
She' s bright and great- looking.
- What does she do?
- Investment.
One of those business suits who makes love to you on a conference call.
She' s no stereotype.
She posed for a feature for Playboy on naked political conservatives.
Well, uh, I don' t know if that' s his type.
She' s probably got augmented cleavage.
Come on.
We were gonna go out.
You should meet Stacey.
I think she just broke up.
Hobie agrees to being fixed up, but he' s still madly in love with Melinda.
He dreams about her all the time.
He' s consumed with jealousy.
He can' t bear the thought that she might be making love with another man.
He wants to know!
But he doesn' t wanna know.
It' s driving him crazy.
Did you hear something?
I heard something at the front.
Can you just go check the door?
Make sure it' s locked.
- What is it?
- I need to talk to you.
You look terrible.
What happened?
I think Laurel and Ellis are having an affair.
What?
I' m going crazy.
I just...
- Take it easy, will you?
- I don' t know what to do.
- Well, what makes you think so?
- I just know it, OK?
I' ve been through this once before.
Laurel is supposed to be my closest friend.
But what makes you think that something' s going on?
I thought it was my paranoia.
Then last week I was coming home from house hunting.
Ellis was out of town.
And I overheard this argument between Laurel and Lee.
- What' s this?
- What?
Whose key is this?
Who' s A?
A?
Who was here?
I don' t know.
- Laurel.
- You had a woman here!
- I can' t listen to these accusations.
- Leave me alone.
I can' t get into another big discussion of my life.
Just because I was up here with someone talking, doesn' t mean we went to bed.
I am finished with this, Lee.
- You' re a fine one to talk.
- What does that mean?
You' d love to call it quits now your eye' s on someone else.
- What?
- You throw yourself at Melinda' s boyfriend.
- Don' t try and turn this around!
- I' m amazed she tolerates it.
You' re mixing things up cos you were caught.
No, you were caught.
I know you when you slip into your seductive mode.
- I' m not gonna have this stupid conversation!
- Don' t worry, I won' t be around much longer.
And then you can feel free to pursue whoever you want!
From that moment, the demons set in.
I just couldn' t sleep.
Doesn' t matter how many pills I take.
I just feel myself consumed with suspicion and I' m ashamed of it.
Cassie, you know it' s true.
I can see it in your face.
Look, you have to pull yourself together.
- You' ve been drinking...
- Stop avoiding answering me.
I don' t know anything.
I called Ellis today.
He' s not where he said he' d be, so I called Laurel' s school.
She' d called in sick.
Clearly, she' s not home sick.
Listen, even if your worst fears were true, you can' tjust go off the deep end.
I pick up the phone extension.
At the same time, I don' t wanna know.
Listen, you cannot give yourself over to fantasies.
Let' s find out the reality first, and stop drinking.
For God' s sakes, it' s not even noon yet.
God.
I have an appointment with your husband at noon.
Well, you' re gonna be late.
I' m afraid the news is not good.
My partner gave it everything he had, but the politics of the situation is just too difficult.
Your ex- husband is very well connected and very determined to keep the children from you.
Naturally, the criminal conviction didn' t help.
It' s funny.
I steeled myself for this result, but now that it' s come...
You know, I know this will sound very Pollyanna, but it' s true.
When they grow up, they will want to know who their mother was and get to know you.
My guess is they' il be quite angry at their father for his unreasonableness.
You' il see.
They' il grow up and come to you.
Well, I' m certain that they will.
I' m sure that they' il take after me and look very much like my mother.
My mother was a very gifted interior decorator.
And I studied art, so I' ve always had this flair for graphics.
Can I get you anything?
No, I just hope that you' il be sending some of your clients to me when I get more established, you know.
Did I tell you that my mother... my mother... my mother was a very gifted interior decorator?
She was very talented.
She did some amazing houses on the Upper West Side.
There' s been no easy way to handle this situation.
I think we need to talk.
No, these situations are never easy.
I' m sorry, Melinda.
I really am sorry.
It' s just...
We planned to tell you, but each of us was so bewildered as how to approach it.
Bewildered.
It' s not like we planned on it happening.
We were going to explain things as soon as we figured out the best approach.
- I loved you.
- I don' t have a satisfying explanation.
You know, these things happen.
Living is messy.
My head is spinning.
I need to lie down and rest.
I wanna close my eyes and never open them again.
- Ellis.
What are you doing?
I' m going out!
Melinda has to come and stay with you for a while.
No, there is no other answer.
She has to be watched, and it' s awkward with me and Ellis under the circumstances.
Well, I can' t be responsible either.
Let' s face it, Cassie.
She' s one of those people who will always need help.
It' s sad, but we have to move on with our lives.
You killed her.
You killed her as I am about to kill you.
Come, Vitus.
Are we men or are we children?
- Of what use...
- So, what do you think?
She' s gorgeous.
Hard to believe a Republican could be that sexual.
I bet she could put your portfolio in order.
- I thought you didn' t like to dance.
- I' m just trying to be a good sport.
I think it' d only be fair to tell you, I' m a liberal.
Are you talking politically or in the bedroom?
I was talking politically.
In the bedroom, I' m a left- wing liberal.
In the bedroom, I' m a radical.
Look, can I level with you?
In the past few months of my marriage I really didn' t sleep with my wife.
We weren' t sleeping at all.
So it' s,... you know.
I' m a little out of practice.
Politically speaking, I' m ready for a little affirmative action.
What do you say we blow this joint and go back to your place?
My place?
Yes, by all means.
It' d be great.
This is like a drea...
So you' re not gonna hold the fact that we have conflicting viewpoints on the direction America should take against me?
I mean, I' d hate to get all worked up and then we find we differ on a tax cut.
Come on.
I haven' t made love in a while either.
Yes.
I will never vote against school prayer again.
- Hey, what are they up to?
- What do you think?
- So much dancing.
- That was so much fun.
You' il have to forgive the disarray.
My cleaning woman won $168 million in the lottery and she asked for the day off.
- Ajoke.
- You must get depressed sleeping alone.
The truth is, I frighten myself.
I' m always worried burglars are gonna break in.
- I bought a baseball bat.
Oh, drinks.
- I know the feeling of being dumped.
Except in my case, it was between my fiancé and my best friend.
- No!
- Yes.
We were school mates.
We went through everything together.
She was the one who was responsible for my meeting my fiancé.
It' s a sad story.
It' s awful.
Do you mind sleeping on cotton sheets?
I know you posed for Playboy on satin.
I couldn' t help noticing how they' d always make eye contact.
I thought I was paranoid, but I should have trusted my instinct.
Always go with your gut feeling.
Sometimes I would pick up the phone after it would ring, and there' d be no one.
- But they were signalling each other.
- Stacey.
Making love, meeting secretly, laughing at me...
- I' m sure they weren' t laughing at you.
- We were moving in together.
Looking for an apartment together, to live together.
I loved him.
- I' m sure.
- My closest friend knew that.
She knew my whole life was wrapped up in him.
Of course.
Maybe a little jazz.
Do you like jazz?
I can' t bear to think about it.
- Don' t think about it.
You know, life is so rotten, so cruel, and then, finally, about nothing.
We can just stretch out on the carpet if you...
I can' t stand it!
I' m going out the window.
What?
- I' m going out the window.
- Stacey, wait!
Are you crazy?
- Leave me alone.
- No, no, no!
Stop it!
- Please!
Let' s talk about what...
Please, let me go.
Let me go!
Kiss me.
I love you.
Please.
My gosh.
What a dream.
Melinda!
What...
- What are you doing here?
- My God.
I was listening at your door.
- For what?
- I was jealous.
Jealous of what?
- Well...
You went home with Stacey, and all night long I' ve been upset.
So I guess I' ve realised how much I care for you.
- Really?
- Is she here?
I heard lovemaking talk.
No, that was a dream.
You were dreaming about her?
I was dreaming of you, actually.
- Me?
Why were you dreaming about me?
- I dreamt I was making love to you.
- Really?
I' m in love with you.
Me?
You never said anything.
I was married, and when it was breaking up you met Bill.
My God.
Couldn' t you tell I' ve been in love with you for a long time?
I couldn' t even tell that I was in love with you.
And now you' re spying on me.
What a silly thing - a grown woman, a mature, sophisticated woman, outside a door, spying.
By the way, I found a piece of your bathrobe in my door.
- Strange.
I should tell my laundress.
- You don' t have a laundress.
Well, marry me and we' il get a laundress.
So, you see, it' s all in the eye of the beholder.
We hear a little story, a few hearsay details.
You mould them into a tragic tale - a woman' s weakness for romance is her undoing.
And that' s how you see life.
Whereas you, you take those details, you put them into an amusing romance.
That' s your take on life.
But, obviously, there is no one definitive essence that can be pinned down.
Well, moments of humour do exist.
I exploit them.
But, you know, they exist within a tragic overall framework.
Is everybody going to Phil Dorfman' s funeral next week?
He dropped dead of a heart attack.
He just had his cardiogram, which was perfect.
- I hate funerals.
- Me too.
Always, at the wrong time, I laugh.
See, that' s my point.
We laugh because it masks our real terror about mortality.
I didn' t mean to bring up the subject of funerals.
Well, how can it be a romantic, funny world if you can' t trust your own cardiogram?
- Now?
Or after your death?
Let' s change the subject.
We came out to have a fun and relaxing evening.
Let' s drink to good times.
Comic or tragic, the most important thing to do is to enjoy life while you can because we only go round once, and when it' s over, it' s over.
And, perfect cardiogram or not, when you least expect it, it could end like that.... like that!
Last orders, please.
- Shaun.
- Yeah?
- Do you see what I' m saying?
I know he' s your best friend but you do live with him.
It' s not that I don' t like Ed.
Ed, it' s not that I don' t like you.
It' s all right.
- It' d just be nice if we could...
- Fuck.... spend a bit more time together.
- Bollocks.
- Just the two of us.
- Cock it.
With Ed here, it' s no wonder I always bring my flatmates out and that only exacerbates things.
- You guys hardly get on, do you?
No, what does "exacerbate" mean?
It means to make things worse.
Well, I mean, it' s not that I don' t like David and Di, you know.
- Guys, it' s not that I don' t like you.
And I do want to spend time with you.
It' s just Ed doesn' t have too many friends.
Can I get any of you cunts a drink?
Anybody?
No, thank you.
I know... friends are important to Shaun but you must set some quality time aside for yourselves.
Daffs is always taking me to see these listed buildings and I' m always dragging him to the theatre.
- I' m not so hot on theatre.
- How about a meal?
- It' s your anniversary soon.
- It was last week.
- Did you do anything special?
- We came here.
Shaun.
Shaun, what I' m trying to say is I need something more, more than spending every night in the Winchester.
I want to do more interesting stuff.
I want you to want to want to do it.
I' m beginning to sound like your mum.
- Not that I' d know.
- You haven' t met his mum?
- Don' t you get along with your mum?
- Are you ashamed by your mum, Shaun?
- No, I love my mum.
- I love his mum. - # She' s like butter # - Ed!
- Shaun!
I understand what you' re trying to say and I agree.
We should get out there.
I' il book a restaurant.
The place that does all the fish.
Things will change.
I promise.
Time, gentlemen. - # This town is coming like a ghost town # - Shaun?
'Player two has entered the game.'
Haven' t you got work?
'Player two has left the game.'
The front door was open again last night.
- I' m not saying it was you.
- I' m saying it was Ed.
- Right.
Look at the state of it.
We' re not students any more.
- He brings no money into the house.
- He brings a bit.
- What?
Dealing drugs?
He sells a bit of weed now and again.
You' ve sold puff.
Yeah, once.
At college.
I' ve known him since primary school.
I like having him around, he' s a laugh.
Because he can impersonate an orang- utan?
- Fuck- a- doodle- doo.
I admit, he can be pretty funny on occasion.
Like that time we stayed up all night drinking apple schnapps and playing Tekken 2.
- When was that?
When' s he going home?
Hey, man, listen...
- Uh- huh.
- I was gonna say...
- I' m on it.
- Erm, since...
Nice shot!
Two seconds.
- All right, Noodle?
- 'Got anything?'
- No, man.
- 'Eball says you was holding.'
- I ain' t got nothing.
- 'Nothing at all?'
I' ve only got an 'enry meself.
- Listen...
- Ed... since you' re not working at the moment could you please clean up a bit?
And if you play the answer machine, can you take down everyone' s messages?
- It' s not that taxing, is it?
Writing something on a scrap of paper?
- Nope.
- Right.
Come on, it was pretty funny.
- Will you do what he said?
- I ain' t doing nothing for him.
I' m sorry, Shaun.
- It' s all right.
- No, no.
Oh!
Oh, my God, that' s rotten.
- I' il stop doing 'em when you stop laughing.
- I am not laughing.
- Get that.
'Shaun, it' s me.
I' m gonna be a bit tied up today
'so can you book the table for eight rather than seven?
'I' il try you at work.
Hey!
- Spare some change, please, mister?
Watch out.
'unexpectedly re- entered Earth' s atmosphere over England
Nelson?
Nelson?
Hello, my friend.
No, it' s a bit early for me.
Gather round, everyone.
Gather round, please.
Gather round.
I' m afraid Ash is feeling a little bit under the weather, so I will be taking charge as the...
- Senior staff member.
So if we can all pull together...
- Hello?
Hello, mate.
- Noel?
I was totally munted last night.
Yeah, I spoke to him.
All right, mate.
- Continue.
Erm, as Mr Sloman always says, there' s no I in team but there is an I in pie.
In...
There' s an I in meat pie.
The anagram of meat is team...
I don' t know what he' s talking about.
Phones off.
It' s not a social gathering.
- All right, keep your hair on, grandad.
- Hey!
I' m 29 for Christ' s sakes.
- How old are you?
I got things I wanna do with my life.
When?
You got red on you.
Hello, mate.
This one comes with a basic digital package.
You' ve got your lifestyle channels there, a bit of Trisha.
Er, you' ve got entertainment.
I don' t know what that is.
News.
All the basic, er... news...
'Coming after me...'
- Shaun.
It' s your dad.
He' s not my dad, he' s my stepdad.
Philip.
Shaun.
You haven' t forgotten about tomorrow?
- Your bimonthly visit.
No, I haven' t forgotten.
You could bring the flowers you forgot on Mother' s Day.
And not a cheap posy from a garage forecourt.
I wasn' t gonna.
Well, we look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
OK.
- I thought it wasn' t a social gathering?
How comes you' re allowed to speak to your dad?
A, he' s not my dad, OK?
And B, it was an emergency.
What, like buying your mum some flowers?
Noel, I do not find it difficult to keep my work and my social life separate.
Shaun, it' s Liz for you.
- Hello.
- 'Hello, it' s me.'
- Hello.
- Yep.
- 'Eight at the place with all the fish?
Just ring me later. '
- Goodbye, Liz.
- 'Bye.
Bye, bye, bye. '
It' s nothing to panic about.
Sir?
Sorry.
Erm, they' re for my mum.
"To a wonderful Mum" or "Supermum"?
- Er... the first one.
London seems to have gone completely bonkers... '
- Oh, my God!
Shaun!
- Yvonne.
Oooh!
How are you doing?
- Surviving.
- Are you living round here?
- Yeah, are you?
- Yeah, I just bought a place.
- I know, bit grown- up, eh?
- Are you still with...?
Glad somebody made it.
How long' s that been now?
- Er, it' s three years ago last week.
- Did you do anything special?
- We' re going out for a meal tonight.
Yeah...
Come on!
- Are you gonna thank me, then?
- For what?
Tidying up.
- It doesn' t look tidy.
- I had a few beers when I finished.
'Hello, Fulci' s.
Can you hold, please? '
- Do you want your messages?
Your mum rang about tomorrow night.
Liz rang about the two of you eating out tonight.
Then your mum rang back to see if I wanted to eat her out tonight.
- 'Hello, Fulci' s.'
- Hi, I know it' s short notice but could you possibly do me a table for two for tonight at about eight?
'Sorry, we just gave away the last table.'
Wasn' t true about your mum.
Where are we gonna go?
- The Winchester.
- Don' t be stupid!
They don' t do food.
- There' s a Breville out back.
- Ed, this is serious!
- 'Hello, it' s me.'
- Hello.
Erm, there' s been a bit of a... a mix- up with the table, babe.
- 'What do you mean?' - They' re full up.
'But...
I thought you said it was all OK? '
'You didn' t book it, did you, Shaun?'
- 'So... what is the plan, then?'
The Winchester?
- 'Hello?' - Dianne, can you let me in?
- 'I' m not sure, Shaun.'
'Lizzie doesn' t want to see you.'
- Just open the door!
- 'She doesn' t want to see you.'
Do you want me to climb up the wall, come through the window?
Because I will.
- OK, see you in a minute.
- 'Don' t...'
'Hi, it' s me again.'
Can we just talk about this?
Let' s go out.
- To the Winchester?
- Do you want to?
- No, I don' t fucking want to!
It' s not the only place in the world.
We' il go to the Shepherd' s, they do Thai in there.
- I' m going out with David and Di.
- Let' s go together.
You hang out with my friends?
I did not call Dianne a failed actress.
Let' s just go somewhere and have a laugh.
Things' il be fine, I promise.
You promised you' d try drinking red wine instead of beer!
- You promised we' d go on holiday.
- We went to Greece!
- We met in Greece.
- At a rave.
It' s not the same.
- You promised us free cable.
- I' m working on that.
I can give up smoking whenever I want.
See, don' t need them.
W - What was the next one?
It' s not enough, Shaun.
'Lf you or someone you know may...'
I' d say your nine lives were up, Shaun.
You go out with her, you love her so much.
'... the devastation really is extensive.
It' s a total mess. '
I don' t know what he meant by that.
Got you these.
- "To a wonderful mum"?
I thought it would be funny because of what you said last night about you don' t want to be my mum and that.
It' s just a little joke, just sort of spur of the moment.
- They' re for your mum, aren' t they?
- Yeah.
If I don' t do something, I' il end up in that pub for the rest of my life like those other sad old fuckers wondering what the hell happened.
Fuck her.
You got your pint.
You got your pig snacks.
You want your favourite monkey?
Shall I do Clyde?
See, I knew you' d get over her.
Who the hell put this on?
It' s on random.
For fuck' s sake.
You know what we should do tomorrow?
Keep drinking.
A Bloody Mary first thing, a bite at the King' s Head, couple at The Little Princess, stagger back here and bang... back at the bar for shots.
How' s that for a slice of fried gold?
- No.
Talk to me.
like these sad old fuckers wondering what the hell happened.
That is harsh.
- These are rich, interesting characters.
Snakehips.
Always surrounded by women.
Strangled his first wife with a draught excluder.
And invented the mobile disco.
What about her, then?
Ooh!
She' s an ex- porn star.
They say she starred in the world' s first interracial hardcore loop.
Cafe Au Lait...
Pour Vous.
Yeah.
He' s North London Mafia.
It' s true, Big Al says so.
Yeah, Big Al also says dogs can' t look up.
Think about it.
Handy with a blade.
Bernie, the trophy wife.
He' s connected.
- The pub' s called the Winchester.
See, you don' t need Liz to have a good time.
- Don' t, man.
- No.
Oi, look at me.
I' m not gonna say if you love her let her go and I' m not gonna bombard you with clichés but what I will say is this... it' s not the end of the world.
Sorry, we' re closed.
Pisshead.
# And all the while I think of you...
What' s the matter, love, haven' t you had your tea?
# Blow away...
What?
He should say base.
Or freeze.
Don' t scratch it!
- That was the second album I ever bought!
- It' s four in the fucking morning!
- It' s Saturday!
It' s fucking Sunday and I' ve got to go to fucking work in four fucking hours because every other fucker is fucking ill!
Now can you see why I' m so fucking angry?
Pete, look,
I' m sorry, we had a couple of drinks, we split up with Liz tonight.
Just keep it down, yeah?
Prick.
What was that?
Nothing.
- Stop it, we' re friends!
- He' s not my friend.
He' s a fucking idiot.
- What' s that supposed to mean?
- It means why don' t you fuck off!
You wanna live like an animal, live in the shed, you thick fuck!
- Leave him alone!
- Stop defending him.
All he ever does is hold you back.
Or is it easier having someone around who' s more of a loser than you?
- What' s that supposed to mean?
I assume it was Liz who did the dumping?
Sort your fucking life out, mate.
- I got mugged on the way home from work.
- Some crackheads.
One of them bit me.
I don' t know, I didn' t stop to ask them!
I' ve got a splitting headache and your stupid hip hop isn' t helping.
And the front door is open.
It' s not hip hop, it' s electro.
Next time I see him, he' s dead.
'Shaun, it' s me.
'so can you book the table for eight rather than seven?
'I' il try you at work.
'Hello, pickle.
'Dad mentioned you might be visiting tomorrow which would be lovely.
'Will you be bringing Elizabeth with you this time?
'Cos these days a lot of people don' t eat meat.'
Do you want anything from the shop?
Cornetto.
Nelson, have you got any papers?
I haven' t even...
Sorry, I haven' t got any change.
I didn' t even have enough at the fucking shop.
There' s... '
#... panic on the streets of London... #
- '... number of reports of...' - '... serious attacks on...'
- '... people who are being...' - '... eaten alive.'
'Witness reports are sketchy.
'... the sensational chart- topping...'
There' s a girl in the garden. - '... emergency services...' - What?
In the garden, there is a girl. '... the armed forces will be called in to provide backup and assistance.
'Scientists are still trying to establish the nature of the phenomenon
'and are unsure as to the...'
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Hello.
- What are you doing?
Oh, my God.
She' s so drunk.
How much have you had, love?
I think she likes you.
- Shut up.
- She wants a cuddle!
- Ed, do something!
- Wait there.
- Ed!
I' m really flattered and everything but...
And, hold it there.
Ed!
Jesus!
- What' s up with her eyes?
Mary, I' m warning you, I' il have to get physical, I mean it!
This is it...
- I think we should go back inside.
- Shaun, what' s going on?
- Shit, it' s engaged.
- How about an ambulance?
- It' s engaged, Ed.
- It' s one number and it' s busy!
- And what do you want a fire engine for?
- Anything with flashing lights.
Are they still out there?
What do you think we should do?
Have a sit- down?
'as thousands of people attempt to flee the cities.
'The M1, the M3, M4, M6...'
- Do you think this is the same thing? - '... are all at a standstill.
'The Home Office is urging people to stay in their homes and await further instruction.'
'Ensure all residences are secure
'with all doors and windows firmly locked and barricaded.
- For God' s sake!
He' s got an arm off!
'More reports just in confirm that in all cases the attackers seem slow and shambolic...'
I' m gonna shut the front door. '... regarding the best way to neutralise the attackers.
'Ln the meantime, contact with these assailants is highly inadvisable.'
- Did you see his head go?
- We should get out there.
- No, we should stay inside.
- We can take 'em.
- The man said to stay indoors.
- Fuck the man.
'... the attackers can be stopped by removing the head or destroying the brain.
'I' il repeat that, by removing the head or destroying the brain.'
Hey!
Aim for the head.
- Now what?
- Get more stuff.
- What' s in the shed?
- Dunno, it' s locked.
- Why is it locked?
That' s the second album I ever bought!
Some of these are limited...
What was that?
- Blue Monday.
- That was an original pressing.
For fuck' s sake.
- Erm...
Purple Rain?
- Sign O 'The Times?
- Definitely not.
- The Batman soundtrack?
- Dire Straits?
- Er...
Ooh, Stone Roses?
- Second Coming?
- I like it.
Ah!
Sade?
- That' s Liz' s.
- I' m going to the shed.
- Which one do you want?
Girl or bloke?
'People receiving bites have experienced headaches and nausea
'and developed symptoms...'
'it is absolutely essential that you isolate them immediately.
'The public are being strongly advised not to approach anyone...'
Pete?
- Why don' t we just go up?
- Don' t go up there!
- Because A, he might be one of them and B, he might still be annoyed.
Pete?
Maybe he went into work.
How come he didn' t drive?
His keys are still here.
He said he wasn' t feeling well.
Oi, prick!
He' s not in.
- You got a fag?
- No, I' ve given up.
- Since when?
Come on, babe.
Oh, she' s engaged.
- That was quick.
- Ed, this is serious.
Liz!
- Mum!
I was gonna call you.
- 'Yes.'
'Some men tried to get into the house.'
- Are they still there?
- 'I' m not sure.
We shut the curtains. '
- Did you try the police?
- 'Well, I thought about it.'
- Are you OK?
Did they hurt you?
- 'No, I' m fine.'
- 'Well... they were a bit bitey.'
- Mum, have you been bitten?
- 'No, but Philip has.'
- Oh, OK.
- No, Philip has.
- Mum, what state is he in?
- 'He' s fine.
Bit under the weather. '
- I see.
- What' s the deal?
We may have to kill my stepdad.
Mum, you' re not safe there.
- 'I don' t want to cause a fuss.'
- We' re coming to get you, Barbara!
So, what' s the plan?
Right.
'We take Pete' s car, we drive over to Mum' s,
'we go in, we take care of Philip.'
I' m so sorry, Philip.
'Then we grab Mum, go over to Liz' s place,
'and wait for all this to blow over.'
- Why have we got to go to Liz' s?
- Because we do.
- She dumped you.
- I have to know if she' s all right.
- Why?
All right, gay.
- I' m not staying there, though.
If we hole up, I want to be somewhere familiar,
I wanna know where the exits are and I wanna be allowed to smoke.
OK...
'go in, deal with Philip.'
Sorry, Philip.
'Grab mum, go to Liz' s, pick her up, bring her back here,
'have a cup of tea and wait for all this to blow over.'
No, wait, we can' t bring them back here.
- Why not?
- It' s not exactly safe, is it?
Look at the state of it.
Where' s safe?
Where' s familiar?
'Take car, go to Mum' s, kill Phil.'
- 'Grab Liz, go to the Winchester,
'have a nice cold pint and wait for all this to blow over.'
How' s that for a slice of fried gold?
'To recap, it is vital that you stay in your homes.
'and avoid all physical contact with the assailants.'
Do you believe everything you hear on TV?
Yeah, I can see it, it' s just outside.
- Don' t say that.
- What?
- That.
- What?
The Z word.
Don' t say it.
- Why not?
All right.
Are there any out there, though?
Maybe it' s not as bad as all that.
Oh!
- OK, let' s do this, yeah?
Yeah!
I got to do a wee first.
Ooh... can I drive?
I always wanted to drive Pete' s car.
I might not get another chance.
Ahh!
Oh, God.
Listen, we' re gonna borrow your car, OK?
Erm, we' il bring it back.
And if you' re feeling better later, we' re... we' re going to the pub.
You' re more than welcome to, er... join us.
Pete' d be so pissed off if he knew I was driving his car.
Shaun, which button' s central locking?
Oh, cock it!
Get lost!
Drive.
'in proclaiming this "a sign of a coming apocalypse".
'Downing Street is refusing to be drawn into a religious debate.
'The bodies of the recently deceased are returning to life and attacking the living.'
Let' s put something else on.
What are you doing?
I think we hit something.
Or someone.
Are you all right?
Come on, let' s just go.
Hello?
- He' s gonna be dead either way.
Oh, thank God for that.
Ah, hello.
Who' s a pretty boy then?
You didn' t say Barbara had a Jag.
I' ve always wanted to drive a Jag.
It' s Philip' s.
He won' t let anybody near it.
I put a Mars Bar in it once and he chased me with a bit of wood.
- Fuck, it' s gorgeous.
- It seems pretty clear, we should go.
Why don' t I stay here?
What, what, what, what, what?
You know, just look after the car.
If there' s any problems...
I' il honk three times.
Don' t forget to kill Philip!
- Hello, pickle.
You' ve got red on you.
Yeah.
Mum, is everything OK?
Are you all right?
- Yes, I' m fine.
- Where' s Philip?
- Dad' s in the lounge.
- He' s not my dad.
Really!
Ed' s outside, we' il take you somewhere safe.
- I don' t think he' s gonna come.
- Philip won' t want to leave the house.
Put the kettle on and I' il deal with Philip.
- OK.
- OK, then.
- You hungry?
- Not really.
- I' il make some sandwiches.
No fighting, you two.
'... you may ask where is our God?
'rise up to confront the unseen enemy.
'they will be courageous in the face of danger.'
- I' m so sorry, Philip.
- Why?
- What have you done now?
- Nothing.
What have you got there?
No, it' s... cricket bat.
- Is that for the jumble, Shaun?
Yes.
Your toys are upstairs.
- I took them all to the tip, Barbara.
- What?
- Shaun wants to take us somewhere.
Maybe you should stay here and wait for the doctor.
- You said he wasn' t coming.
- You didn' t call the doctor?
- I' m fine.
We had ourjabs when we went to the Isle of Wight.
- But, Philip...
- A lot of drug nuts running wild.
- But I should get Mum away.
- I' m not going anywhere without Philip.
How about that tea?
Mum, how much do you love Philip?
- I haven' t had sugar in my tea since 1982.
Will you cut me some bread, love?
Mum, look, how much do you love Philip?
Do we have to go through all that again?
What would you say if I told you that Philip' s been quite unkind to me?
- He chased me with a bit of wood!
- You did call him a you- know- what.
- Did he tell you that?
Motherfucker.
Sorry, Mother...
Did you know that on several occasions... he touched me?
That wasn' t true.
Made it up, shouldn' t have, sorry.
- You don' t understand...
Philip is my husband and has been for 17 years and I would at least expect you to respect my feelings.
You must be more adult about these things.
Yeah.
There comes a time when... you just... gotta be a man.
I' m telling you, it' s a fuss over nothing.
Hello, Edward.
- Hi, Barbara.
You better believe it.
What happened?
- It wasn' t as easy as all that.
- Are we following you?
No, it' s probably best if we...
Hmm...
I pranged it.
You were parked.
I guess we' il have to take the Jag.
- Philip?
- What?
Christ!
- Give me the car keys!
- You' re not driving that car.
Give me the car keys!
I' m on it.
Don' t worry about me.
- Maybe I should drive.
- I' ve adjusted the seat now.
Can you please turn that noise down?
Are you all right, dear?
I' d be fine if it weren' t for that bloody racket.
- It is a bit loud.
You do realise this is a 20 mile an hour zone?
- Here.
- Have you still got the child locks on?
- Safety first, Shaun.
Hey, man, watch the leather.
Keep moving.
If there' s any problems...
I' il do the honks.
'Hello?'
Hello?
- Guys, can you let me in?
I' ve come to get you.
- What are you doing?
- I' ve come to take you somewhere safe.
- We were safe!
- You don' t know that.
There was two of them out there.
How many are there now?
It only takes one of them to know you' re in here.
I tried calling but I couldn' t get through.
I had to come up with a plan.
- Oh, you made a plan?
- We have to get out of here.
If we don' t, they' il tear us to pieces.
And that will exacerbate things for all of us.
- Shaun...
- This is not about you and me.
We need to be somewhere more secure, somewhere we can stay alive.
- We' re with you, Shaun.
- What?
- We' re with you.
- I' m not going out there.
I don' t want to be torn to pieces and if you think about it, neither do you.
- I' m not going if Lizzie' s not going.
- She' s going.
- I' m not staying by myself.
- You' re going, aren' t you?
- Lizzie?
- All right, Flash, what' s your plan?
I' ve got a car but it' s gonna be a bit cramped now.
Has anyone got transport?
- Yes!
- Great.
Where?
Well, I' ve passed my test.
David?
I don' t see the point of owning a car in London.
Look, just get any blunt objects together.
If you get cornered, bash them in the head.
Keep together, stay sharp and follow me.
So, what' s the plan, then?
We' re going to the Winchester.
OK?
- Come on.
What' s up, niggaz?
Apologies for the cramped conditions.
Di, stay on David' s lap.
Philip, hang in there, OK?
Ed, get there fast.
And, Mum, this is Liz.
Liz, Mum.
Ed, be careful.
- Is your dad all right?
- He' s not my dad.
- He' s bleeding.
Thought you wanted to get there fast?
I want to get there in one piece!
Why are we going this way?
Chill out, it' s a short cut.
- That road goes to the Winchester.
- Shaun...
- Liz, please!
- I don' t understand why the Winchester?
- It' s a pub, it' s safe, it' s secure.
- They know us.
- It' s got big heavy doors and deadbolts.
And there' s a rifle above the bar.
- I would think that' s deactivated.
John' s connected.
Big Al says so.
Big Al also says dogs can' t look up.
- They can' t.
- Can' t they?
- Of course they can!
Yes!
The pub is the right place to go.
Everything is gonna be fine.
- Shaun...
What?
- Being a father, it' s not easy.
You were 12 when I met you, you' d already grown up so much.
I just wanted you to be strong and not give up because you lost your dad.
- Philip, you don' t have to explain.
- No, I do.
And I always thought you had it in you to do well.
You just need... m- motivation.
I thought it could be me.
Would you just... take care of your mum?
There' s a good boy.
- Ed, can you pull over?
- Ah!
Ed, please pull over.
- What for?
- Just pull over!
Whoa, momma!
- What the hell are you doing?
- Chill out.
Everyone' s all right.
- And everybody is not all right.
- What' s wrong?
Mum, it' s Philip, he' s gone.
- Where' s he gone?
No, he isn' t.
Get out!
Jesus!
- Get it open!
- Ed, get the child locks!
- The child lock!
- Now what?
- How do we get Philip out the car?
- We haven' t got time.
- We can' t leave your dad.
- He' s not my dad!
Mum, he was, but he' s not any more.
- I really think we could...
- That' s not your husband in there.
It looks like him but there is nothing of the man you loved in that car.
Let' s go, shall we?
You' re not suggesting we walk?
- Everybody OK?
Maybe we should all hold hands, make a crocodile?
Do you know where we' re going?
- David, come on.
- Sorry.
- Do you, though?
- Yeah, totally.
We' re pretty close.
- Is your mum gonna be OK?
- Yeah, I hope so.
- Did you contact your folks?
- They' re in Antigua.
- Do you think this is happening there?
- I hope not.
About last night.
I know loads of things were said but...
- You said this wasn' t about us.
- No, it' s not.
- You said it was about survival.
- It is, but...
You' re notjust trying to prove something?
I meant everything I said last night.
- Maybe this isn' t the best time to talk.
Shaun.
Yvonne.
- How' s it going?
- Er, surviving.
Hey, Liz.
Long time no see.
Hey, Yvonne.
Erm... this is my boyfriend, Declan.
- my mum and my cousin Tom.
This is Shaun and his girlfriend Liz.
- They' ve split up, actually.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- That' s a shame.
Have you got somewhere you' re going?
- Yeah, we' re going to the Winchester.
- Yeah.
- Right, well.
Hi.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
See?
The Winchester' s just over there.
- Over where?
Just over there, over the 20 garden fences?
What' s the matter, David?
Never taken a short cut before?
Shaun.
I' m sure Jill and Derek live round here.
Now, the Winchester is just over that fence, all right?
Everyone stay where they are, I' il...
Are we all here?
- One, two, three, four, five.
Mum!
I' m coming!
Mum, are you OK?
I don' t think Jill and Derek do live here.
Shaun?
Are you all right?
What are you doing?
Shaun!
Yes!
No, that' s rubbish.
- Ooh!
Feel free to step in any time.
- You did all right.
- I didn' t want to cramp your style.
Right.
OK, everyone stay where they are.
I' m gonna check if the coast is clear.
- Is it clear?
- No.
- How many?
Oh, well, that is just great.
I trust Shaun has another genius scheme up his sleeve?
This is hardly constructive, David!
- We should have stayed at the flat.
Because, because of...
Captain Wow.
- Will you stop it?
Right, let' s all shake out.
Or not.
Take another look at the way he moves.
Remember, very limp.
Almost like sleepwalking.
Look at the face, it' s vacant with a hint of sadness.
Like a drunk who' s lost a bet.
OK, let' s try, shall we?
Nice.
Good vocal work.
Barbara, that' s excellent.
Sorry, dear, I was miles away.
- D- Daffs.
- Urgh.
It' s mournful, sorrowful, you' re dead and you hate it.
Uuurgh.
- Much better.
This is the night!
- What is that?
Who died and made you fucking king of the zombies?
Don' t...
Yeah, that' s pretty good.
Right, let' s all try together, shall we?
Go, go, go, go.
Shit!
Get round me, get round me!
John?
John, Bernie, are you there?
It' s Shaun and Ed.
We come in all the time.
- They can hear you.
- We do the quiz.
- They know.
- Stay in character!
- I can' t see them.
- Shaun, we have to get inside.
- Break the window.
- We' il be exposed!
- Break the window!
- Is there another way in?
Yeah, there' s...
Two seconds.
Hey, Noodle.
- 'All right?' - Yeah, man, I can' t talk now.
- 'You get anything yet?' - I got nothing.
I' m in the middle of something.
Yeah, it' s weird.
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
You stupid moron.
- Fuck off.
Fuck fucking off!
I' ve spent an entire life...
I' ve spent my entire life sticking up for you and all you ever do is fuck things up and make me look stupid.
I' m not gonna let you do it any more.
Not today!
Shaun.
You were saying about another way in?
Yeah, there' s a...
What are you doing?
- No!
- Get inside.
Keep up the act, I' il have to do something.
- What do you mean do something?
- Hello, hello, over here!
Come on, that' s it.
Come on, that' s it, over here!
Come on.
- Wait till I' ve gone then get inside.
I won' t be long, I promise.
Come on, you pasty- faced fuckers, let' s go!
Follow me.
Come on, this way, that' s it!
This way, follow me.
Come on, follow me.
Come and get it.
It' s a running buffet.
All you can eat!
- Come on, Barbara.
Leave those.
- He' s been gone a good 20 minutes.
Either way, we need to think about blocking up this window.
We' re totally exposed.
- How will Shaun get back in?
- Let' s get some lights on.
- Power' s off.
- That' s a good thing.
- We mustn' t advertise our whereabouts.
- Do we, David?
- No, of course not, Lizzie.
And there' s a hole in the window.
- You did that, you twat.
- Somebody had to do something!
Somebody has to take control of the situation and if none of you are prepared to accept that responsibility then perhaps...
I should.
- Will Shaun be gone long?
- He' il be back soon.
- How do you know?
- I don' t think he' d leave us.
How can you trust a man you binned for being unreliable?
A man whose idea of a romantic nightspot is also an impenetrable fortress.
This is a pub!
We are in a pub!
I could get a round in.
Let' s just wait for Shaun.
We' il barricade the window when he gets back.
What then?
How long?
A month?
- What are we going to eat?
- Toasties!
- There' s a Breville out back.
Must be why Shaun took us here before he left.
- He' s coming back!
- Why?
If he does, do you think his master plan will be anything more than eating peanuts?
Is he just gonna stroll in and suddenly everything' s OK?
I don' t know, David!
I don' t know any more than you do.
But what I do know is that we' re here now and we have to make the best of it.
- Ed, get me a double vodka.
I' il have a drink too.
Would you like a drink, Barbara?
- Hello.
- Right, great, fuck it.
We' il have a party and get completely smashed.
We' ve got our nibbles.
We' ve got our Mini Cheddars.
- We got Twiglets.
Pickle!
Hello, Mum.
You all right?
- Everybody OK?
- Yeah.
- Any sign of John and Bernie?
- Check upstairs?
- It' s locked.
- Phones?
- Dead.
Same as the power.
- Nice of you to join us.
Yeah, well, I promised, didn' t I?
How did you lose them?
I just gave them the slip.
Wasn' t difficult.
They' re not all that.
- Well, how did you get in?
I tried to tell you before you smashed the window.
But it wasn' t me blowing our cover by arguing with my boyfriend.
- Might be a bit warm, the cooler' s off.
Thanks, babe.
So, what' s the plan, then?
Would anyone like a peanut?
Why don' t you do your Clyde?
Has anyone seen Every Which Way But Loose?
Ed does the most amazing impression of the orang- utan.
- No, it' s not.
- It is.
Come on.
- No, no.
- But it' s brilliant.
Come on.
- You' ve built it up too much.
- No, just do it.
Everyone wants to see it.
Do it, do it, do it, do it.
Come on, do it.
- The power' s on.
- It' s not, I tried it earlier.
I' il flip the fuses, we can watch television.
- What about the lights?
- Yes.
Don' t advertise our whereabouts.
The lights are on a separate circuit.
It' s quite simple, David.
- Is that it?
Liz, erm... have you got a quid?
Erm...
Yeah.
Never anything on, is there?
What?
- I think we might have a bit of a problem.
- They followed me.
- I thought you said you gave them the slip.
Yeah.
Well, we' il just have to be extra quiet then, won' t we?
What?
Ed, no!
Shit!
- Where the hell did he come from?
- Who put this on?
Dianne, get Mum somewhere safe.
David, kill the Queen.
- What?!
- The jukebox!
- Liz, Ed, grab a weapon.
- What about the rifle?
- Cocktails?
The flaming spirits Get a rag in, light it.
- But the whole place could go up.
- What, then?
- # Cos I' m having... # - John, it' s time at the bar.
# I' m burning through the sky...
- I can' t find the switches!
- # I' m a rocket ship on my way to Mars...
- Why is Queen still on?
- We have a situation!
- Fuck this.
Two seconds.
# I' m burning through the sky, yeah...
Shaun! #... call me Mister Fahrenheit...
Yes!
Yes!
Ooow!
Why didn' t you just shoot him, man?
Ed, for the last time, it' s...
I fucking knew it!
What did I tell you?
Big Al was right.
But dogs can look up.
- Has anyone fired a gun before?
- Oh, yeah.
- Apart from Ed?
- I' m a pacifist.
- Apart from David and Ed?
- What was Ed' s experience?
- He shot his sister in the leg.
- I think you should do it.
- We should all do it.
- How can five people operate one gun?
- No one has any experience.
We' ve got...
- 29 bullets.
- Call them shells.
29 shells.
I need someone to help me reload, everyone else to look out.
As Bertrand Russell said the only thing that will redeem mankind is co- operation.
I think we can all appreciate that now.
- Yeah, it was Guinness Extra Cold.
- I won' t say anything.
- They want to come in.
- Get Mum out of the way.
David, Dianne, let' s go.
- Barbara.
- Would you like to come with me?
- That' d be lovely.
It' s nice to meet you, finally.
Shaun' s always talking about you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Ah!
Are you all right?
Shaun' s father gave me this.
Shaun' s real father, I mean.
- I' d like you to have it.
It seems only right.
I didn' t want to say anything.
I thought Shaun would be worried.
Liz!
- Stay behind me!
Sorry, we' re closed!
- The safety!
- That happened to me on stage.
- There!
- Where?
Quarter to twelve.
- What?
- 11: 45!
Top left!
- Reload.
- I' m on it!
Nice shot.
OK, David, Dianne, let' s block up this window!
Ed, take over a sec.
What' s wrong?
- Mum, what' s wrong?
- Mum, what' s wrong?
- Mum, I don' t understand.
- The man in his pyjamas.
I didn' t want to say anything, I thought you' d be upset.
No, you should' ve said.
- Take over a sec.
- What' s going on?
- What the hell' s going on?
- Barbara' s hurt!
- Just take over a minute.
I know first aid.
Just hang on.
Mum!
- Mum.
Just hold on, Mum, you' re gonna be fine.
- I never thanked you.
"To a wonderful mum."
It' s been a funny sort of day, hasn' t it?
Oh, no, no!
Mum, come on.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Mum.
- What are you doing?
- We have to deal with her.
- Daffs!
- For Christ' s sake!
- She' s gonna come back!
- She' s not going anywhere.
- She' il change.
- She' s a zombie.
- Don' t say that.
Move aside.
One... two... three!
- Don' t point that gun at my mum!
Don' t point that gun at Barbara!
- Ed, don' t exacerbate things!
- What' s that mean?
- This isn' t exactly fair.
- Thank you.
Please, can we just stop and think about this?
Tell him to put the gun down!
She' s gonna change.
And when she does, she' il kill all of us.
That' s what your ex can' t seem to realise.
That' s what this is about, isn' t it?
He' s always hated me and now he wants to shoot my mum.
- You' ve never thought I was good enough.
- We all know you' re in love with Liz.
- That is not true.
- Yes it is!
- That is not true.
- What?
- I know you only hung out with me to get close to Liz and when she knocked you back, I was there to pick up the pieces.
I' ve come to terms with that, Daffs, why can' t you?
Lizzie, I want you to know that my feelings for you...
There are slightly more pressing matters at hand here.
- Like "Daffs" pointing a gun at my mum.
- I' m not being unreasonable, "Pickle".
- Christ, she' s not dead!
- She' s finished.
You' ve gone from a chartered accountant to Charlton Heston.
I' m not a chartered accountant.
- Well, you look like one.
- Yeah.
- I' m a lecturer.
- You' re a twat.
In a minute she' il be just another zombie.
- Don' t say that.
Please can we just calm the fuck down!
Now, I can see what David is trying to say...
- Thank you.
Yep.
And, Shaun...
I can' t begin to imagine how hard this must be for you but we can' t afford to fall apart.
Shaun, babe...
I know you don' t wanna hear this...
You do it.
I' m sorry, Mum.
Do it!
I think we' re all agreed, you did the right thing there.
David, no!
David!
- Right, I' m leaving.
- What?
- I' m not staying here.
- I think you should go.
- We will.
We can defend ourselves.
- What do you mean "we"?
Opening that door now would be a very silly thing to do.
- You gonna stay here with him?
- Look...
- After where he led us?
Shaun didn' t ask you to come here.
You came for the same reason I did.
- Get away from that door this instant!
- But...
I' m so sorry, Dianne.
Maybe I' m not the one you should be apologising to.
Shaun...
David!
No!
No!
No!
David!
- No!
David!
Dianne, no!
David!
Oh dear.
- Cocktails?
Stay back!
Shaun, hold them!
Heads!
- Ed!
Shauny, look who it is.
Fuck- a- doodle- doo!
Ed!
- Shaun!
- Ed!
Don' t groan at me, you thick fuck!
No!
- Shaun!
I said leave him alone!
Ed.
Shaun, bar!
Ed!
Ed!
Ed!
What?
- Where are the shells?
Oh, fuck.
Ow!
Fuck it!
What are we gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?
- The cellar.
- Maybe we can get out!
- There' s a hatch out on to the street.
Oh, give us a fucking break!
Go!
I can see the street.
Come on.
Come on!
Why won' t it open?
That' s it then, we' re trapped.
"Hey, let' s go to the Winchester!"
Man, I' ve really ballsed this up.
- No, you haven' t.
- I have, Liz.
I couldn' t save Di or David.
I couldn' t even save Mum.
I' m useless.
You shouldn' t feel so responsible, you tried.
You did something, that' s what counts.
Yeah, I suppose.
Do you think they' il get through?
Erm... two.
I suppose we could take a few of them out if they stand in a line.
I wasn' t thinking about them.
- What about Ed?
There' s only two shells.
How are we gonna do this?
I don' t know.
Erm...
One should do the other and then do themselves.
You should do me.
I don' t think I' ve got it in me to shoot my flatmate, my mum and my girlfriend all in the same evening.
What makes you think I' ve taken you back?
Well... you don' t want to die single, do you?
Actually...
I would like to be shot.
Besides, I' ve changed.
I haven' t had a fag since yesterday, I promise.
Maybe we should have one now.
- You left them in my flat.
- Yeah, in the bin.
- I was desperate.
- Sneaky monkey.
- I won' t say anything.
Come on, we' re getting out of here.
- I mightjust stay here.
- You two should make a go of it.
- What are you talking about?
- I only hold you back.
Maybe you should have this.
- Don' t you want it?
- No.
I can' t hit anything with it anyway, I' m rubbish.
- Ed, I' m sorry.
- Cos I was shouting at you earlier on.
- It' s all right.
I' m sorry too.
It' s OK.
No...
Oh, God!
- I' il stop doing 'em when you stop laughing.
- I' m not laughing.
You' d better be off.
Bye, Ed.
Cheers.
I love you too, man.
Gay.
- Ready?
Section One.
Ready.
Zombies to your front.
Fire!
Oh, my God!
Shaun!
- How are you doing?
They' re taking us somewhere safe.
I thought you two might want to tag along.
Is itjust the two of you?
Well, glad somebody made it.
Come on.
'who fought off the reanimated corpses of his entire family.
'As we now know, the phenomenon resulted from the use of...'
'make them ideal recruitment for the service industry,
'He can' t quite get it.
He' s fallen, he' s down! '
'I don' t see nothing wrong with it but I know that some people would.
I still love him and I got the ring.
- 'You go to bed with it?' - 'Course I do.'
'People can' t understand why she' s with him?'
'Lnitial claims that the virus was caused by infected monkeys have been dismissed...'
What' s the plan, then?
Right, a cup of tea... then we get the Sundays.
Head down the Phoenix for a roast, veg out in the pub for a bit then wander home, watch a bit of telly, go to bed.
- Perfik.
- I' il get the kettle on.
- Can I have two sugars, please?
- I might pop into the garden for a bit.
Two seconds.
'Player two has entered the game.'
# Ooh, you make me live
# Whatever this world can give to me
So where are you?
You just wake up and you' re in..... in a motel room.
There' s the key.
It feels like maybe it' s the first time you' ve been here but..... perhaps you' ve been there for a week,..... three months, it' s...
It' s kind of hard to say, I...
It' s just an anonymous room.
This guy.
He' s here already.
Lenny!
It' s Leonard.
- Like I told you before.
- Did you?
I must have forgot.
I guess I' ve already told you about my condition.
Oh, well, only every time I see you.
- My car.
- This is your car.
Oh, you' re in a playful mood.
- It' s not good to make fun of a handicap.
- Just trying to have a little fun.
- Roll up your window.
- It' s broken.
- I can get that fixed for you.
- So, where to, Sherlock?
- I got a lead on a place.
- What the hell you wanna go there for?
- You know it?
Yeah, it' s just this fucked up building.
Why do you wanna go there?
Don' t remember.
- Looks like somebody' s home.
- Ah, that thing' s been here for years.
What are you talking about?
These tracks are only a few days old.
Tracks?
What are you, Pocahontas?
Let' s take a look inside.
Don' t believe his lies.
He is the one.
Kill him.
I' ve finally found him.
How long have I been looking?
Find anything?
Didn' t think so.
Let' s go, huh?
You' re gonna pay for what you did.
Beg forgiveness and then you pay.
You don' t have a clue, you freak!
Beg my wife' s forgiveness before I blow your brains out.
Leonard, you don' t know what' s going on.
- You don' t even know my name.
- Teddy.
Cos you read it off a fucking picture.
(breathless) You don' t know who you are.
- I' m Leonard Shelby from San Francisco.
- That' s who you were.
That' s not..... what you' ve become.
- Shut your mouth.
Come on.
Come on, let' s go down to the basement.
Then you' il know who you really are.
It' s just an anonymous room.
There' s nothing in the drawers.
But you look anyway.
Nothing except the Gideon Bible,..... which I, of course, read religiously.
You know who you are and you know kind of all about yourself.
But just for day- to- day stuff, notes are really useful.
Sammy Jankis had the same problem but he really had no system.
He wrote himself a ridiculous amount of notes but he' d get them all mixed up.
You really do need a system if..... if you' re gonna make it work.
- I' m Mr Shelby from 304.
- What can I do for you, Leonard?
- Burt.
Burt.
I' m not sure, I think I may have asked you to hold my calls.
- You don' t know?
- I' m not too good on the phone.
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them.
- You don' t remember saying that.
- I have this condition.
- It' s my memory.
- Amnesia?
- No, no, it' s different from that.
I have no short- term memory.
Since my injury I can' t make new memories.
Everything fades.
If we talk for too long I' il forget how we started..... and next time I see you I won' t remember this conversation.
I don' t even know if I' ve met you before.
So if I seem a little strange or rude, or something, uh...
I' ve told you this before, haven' t I?
I don' t mean to mess with you but it' s so weird.
- You don' t remember me at all?
- We' ve talked a bunch of times.
- I' m sure we have.
What' s the last thing you remember?
My wife.
What' s it like?
It' s like you just woke up.
That must suck.
It' s all backwards.
Like, maybe you got an idea about what you want to do next..... but you don' t remember what you just did.
I mean, I' m exactly the opposite...
- How long have I been staying here?
- Couple of days.
- And you' re holding my calls?
- Like you said.
OK, but this guy' s an exception.
You know this guy?
- Yeah, it' s your friend, right?
- What makes you think that?
- I saw you together, that' s all.
- He' s not my friend.
If he calls or shows up here, give me a call in my room, OK?
- What, his name' s Teddy?
Look, I hope my condition' s not gonna be a problem for you.
Not as long as you remember to pay the bill.
Forty.
This guy.
He' s here already.
Lenny!
You really need a system if you' re gonna make it work.
It becomes an important part of your life.
You write yourself notes.
Where you put them is really important.
You need a jacket that' s got, like, six pockets,..... particular pockets for particular things.
You have to be wary of other people writing stuff for you..... that is not going to make sense or is gonna lead you astray.
I don' t know what makes people take advantage..... of somebody with this condition.
It' s a permanent way of keeping a note.
Who is this?
Remember Sammy Jankis.
- Sir, you left these at your table.
- Thanks.
Just go straight out on Sixth Street,...
-.. go east through town...
- I' m gonna write this down.
Go straight out...
- Trust me, I need to write this down.
The Discount Inn.
Discount Inn.
Natalie.
My car.
Teddy.
John Edward Gammell.
This guy told me his name was Teddy.
Don' t believe his lies.
- Mr Gammell?
- Lenny, is that you?
- John Gammell?
Lenny, it' s Teddy.
I' il be right over.
- (line goes dead)
White male.
First name, John.
Last name G for Gammell.
Drugs.
License plate.
SG13..... 7lU.
It' s him.
I' ve found you, you fuck.
You said we talked before.
I don' t remember that.
Yeah, but it' s not amnesia.
I remember up until my injury, I just can' t make new memories.
So I can' t remember talking to you.
What did we talk about?
Oh, Sammy Jankis.
I guess I tell people about Sammy to help them understand.
Sammy' s story helps me understand my own situation.
But he got mixed up.
I have a more graceful solution to the memory problem.
I' m disciplined and organized.
I use habit and routine to make my life possible.
Sammy had no drive,..... no reason to make it work.
Yeah,..... I got a reason.
Today, 1pm, meet Natalie for info.
She will help you out of pity.
- Natalie.
- You don' t remember me.
- I should' ve explained.
I have this cond...
Please call me Leonard.
My wife called me Lenny.
- I know, you told me.
- Then I probably told you I hated it.
It' s hard for me to...
So, you have information for me?
- Is that what your little note says?
Must be tough living your life according to a couple of scraps of paper.
Mix your laundry list with your grocery list and you' il end up eating your underwear.
I guess that' s why you have those freaky tattoos.
Look, I' m sorry I don' t remember you.
It' s nothing personal.
I do have information for you.
You gave me a license- plate number.
Had my friend at DMV trace it.
Guess what name came up?
John Edward Gammell.
John G.
No.
But his face on his driver' s license looked really familiar.
Here' s a copy of his license, his registration, photo and all.
Are you sure you want this?
- Have I told you what this man did?
Well, then you shouldn' t have to ask.
Even if you get revenge, you' re not gonna remember it.
You' re not even gonna know it happened.
It doesn' t make any difference if I know about it.
Just because there are things I don' t remember..... doesn' t make my actions meaningless.
The world doesn' t just disappear when you close your eyes.
Anyway, maybe I' il take a photograph to remind myself.
Get another freaky tattoo.
Tell me about her again.
Why?
Because you like to remember her.
She was beautiful.
- To me she was perfect.
Don' t just recite the words.
Close your eyes and remember her.
The bits and pieces you never bothered to put into words.
Even if you don' t want to.
You put these together and you get the feel of a person.
Enough to know how much you miss them.
And how much you hate the person who took them away.
I, um, I added an address in here.
It might be useful.
It' s an abandoned place outside of town.
Um, I guy I knew used to do bigger deals there.
It' s isolated.
Sounds perfect.
- Do I owe you any...
- I wasn' t helping you for money.
- I' m sorry.
- It' s OK.
See, you have this condition.
You still staying at the Discount Inn?
Left it at my place.
- They treating you OK?
- I don' t remember.
You know what we have in common?
We are both survivors.
You take care, Leonard.
Remember Sammy Jankis.
I was an investigator.
I' d investigate the claims to see which ones were phoney.
It was useful experience cos now it' s my life.
When I meet someone, I don' t know if I' ve met them before.
I have to look in their eyes and try and figure them out.
My job taught me the best way to find out what someone knew was let them talk.
Watch the eyes and the body language.
It really means they' re nervous.
It' s all about context.
Yeah, I was good.
Sammy was my first real challenge.
I thought you' d split for good.
- Well, things change.
- So I see.
- My name' s Teddy.
- I guess I' ve told you about my condition.
Only every time I see ya.
Come on, I' il buy you lunch.
- Mmm.
I' m sick of hearing about the guy.
What about John G?
- Who?
- Johnny G, the guy you' re looking for.
- That' s why you haven' t left town, right?
- Maybe.
- Leonard, you have to be very careful.
- Why?
Get you to kill the wrong guy.
I go on facts, not recommendations, but thank you.
Lenny, you can' t trust a man' s life to your little notes and pictures.
- Why not?
- Because your notes could be unreliable.
- Memory' s unreliable.
- Oh, please.
Memory' s not perfect, it' s not even that good.
Ask the police.
Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.
The cops don' t catch a killer by sitting around remembering stuff.
- That' s not what I' m saying.
Facts, not memories.
That' s how you investigate.
I know, it' s what I used to do.
Memory can change the shape of a room, it can change the color of a car.
And memories can be distorted.
They' re an interpretation, not a record.
They' re irrelevant if you have the facts.
You really want to get this guy, don' t you?
He killed my wife.
He took away my fucking memory.
He destroyed my ability to live.
You' re living.
Only for revenge.
Well, then we' il get the bastard.
Where are you staying?
The Discount Inn.
I haven' t got my key.
Probably left it in your room.
I' m checked in here but I think I' ve misplaced my key.
How you doing, Leonard?
Probably in the room, right?
- I don' t see my key anywhere.
This is the wrong room.
You' re in 304.
I fucked up.
- No.
Come on, let' s go.
Then why is this my handwriting?
Well,... this was your room but now you' re in 304.
- When was I in here?
- Last week.
- Then I rented you another room on top.
Business is slow, I mean, I told my boss about your condition and stuff,..... he said rent him another room.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this shit hole?
Just two.
So far.
Well,..... at least you' re being honest about ripping me off.
- You' re not going to remember anyway.
- You don' t have to be that honest, Burt.
Leonard.
Always get a receipt.
I' il write that down.
- Hey, what time is it?
- Quarter to one.
- Natalie.
- You don' t remember me.
I' d just become an investigator when I came across Sammy.
Mr Samuel R Jankis, strangest case ever.
The guy' s a 58- year- old, semiretired accountant.
He and his wife were in this car accident, nothing serious.
But he' s acting funny, he can' t get a handle on what' s going on.
The doctors find some possible damage to the hippocampus, nothing conclusive.
Sammy can' t remember anything for more than a couple of minutes.
Can' t work, can' t do shit.
The medical bills pile up, his wife calls the insurance company and I get sent in.
This is my first big claims investigation so I really check into it.
He can only remember things for a couple of minutes.
He' d watch TV but anything longer than a couple of minutes was too confusing,..... he couldn' t remember how it began.
He liked commercials.
It' s time for my shot.
The crazy part was that this guy,..... who couldn' t follow the plot of Green Acres any more,..... could do the most complicated things,..... as long as he learned them before the accident..... and as long as he kept his mind on what he was doing.
It' s rare but legit.
But he says he can' t remember me at all.
Now, I can read people and I' m thinking "bad actor".
So now I' m suspicious and I order more tests.
Oh, where am I?
Oh, it must be her room.
But who is she?
It' s only me.
- Did you sleep OK?
You?
I gotta be someplace.
It' s pretty weird.
It' s useful.
You never write a phone number on your hand?
-.. about the license plate.
- Yeah, the license plate.
John G' s license plate.
You have it tattooed on your thigh.
She will help you out of pity.
If it' s registered in this state,..... it should only take a couple seconds to pull up his license and registration.
I' il call you as soon as I talk to him.
Could we arrange a meeting now?
I' m not too good on the phone.
You know, it' s great that you...
Well, that you' re..... helping me..... like this.
I' m helping you because you helped me.
So next time you see me,..... will you remember me?
(softly) I think you will.
(softly) I' m sorry.
Lenny, before you go, could I have my shirt back, please?
I thought you' d split for good.
Sammy couldn' t pick up any new skills at all.
Conditioning.
Sammy should still be able to learn through repetition.
It' s how you learn stuff like riding a bike.
You get better through practice.
It' s a different part of the brain from the short- term memory.
So I had the doctors test Sammy' s response to conditioning.
- Pick up any three objects.
Where were you guys when I did my CPA?
What the fuck?
- It' s a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack.
Some of the objects were electrified.
They' d give him a shock.
They kept repeating the test, always with the same objects electrified.
The point was to see if Sammy could learn to avoid the electrified objects,..... not by memory, but by instinct.
Natalie, right?
Who the fuck is Dodd?
Guess I don' t have to worry about him any more.
Come inside.
- Who is he?
You offered to help.
It' s nothing to do with your investigation.
How did you get me into this?
You offered to help me when you saw what he did to my face.
- How do I know he did that to your face?
I showed you what he did and I asked you to help me.
- Oh, and I just take your word?
Something doesn' t feel right.
I think someone' s fucking with me, trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
- What?
Kill him?
- Course not!
- Hey.
Sit down, OK?
This has nothing to do with you.
You have to burn them.
Leonard, you decided to help me.
Trust your own judgement.
You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
- There are things you know for sure.
(knocks)
I know what that' s gonna feel like when I pick it up.
Certainties.
It' s the kind of memory you take for granted.
You know, I can remember so much.
The feel of the world...
And her.
She' s gone.
And the present is trivia which I scribble down as fucking notes.
Hey, come on.
- It' s not easy for me to relax.
Come on, take your jacket off.
Didn' t think you were the type.
It' s backwards.
Come here.
What about here?
Maybe it' s... for when I find him.
I' ve lost somebody too.
I' m sorry.
His name was Jimmy.
- What happened to him?
He never came back.
- Who did he go to meet?
What do the police think?
They don' t look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
When you find this guy, this..... John G, what are you gonna do?
I' m gonna kill him.
Maybe I can help you find him.
I don' t even know how long she' s been gone.
It' s like I' ve woken up in bed and she' s not here..... because she' s gone to the bathroom or something.
I just know she' s never gonna come back to bed.
If I could just..... reach over and touch her side of the bed,..... I would know that it was cold.
But I can' t.
But I don' t want to wake up in the morning thinking she' s still here.
I lie here not knowing how long I' ve been alone.
How can I heal?
How am I supposed to heal if I can' t..... feel time?
She has also lost someone.
She will help you out of pity.
They kept testing Sammy for months.
Always with the same objects carrying the electrical charge.
What the fuck?
- It' s a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack!
Even with total short- term memory loss,..... Sammy should have learned instinctively to stop picking up the wrong objects.
Other cases responded to conditioning, Sammy didn' t respond at all.
It suggested that his condition was psychological not physical.
We turned down his claim on the grounds that he wasn' t covered for mental illness.
His wife got stuck with the bills and I got a big promotion.
But it works for me.
I live the way Sammy couldn' t.
Habit and routine make my life possible.
Conditioning.
Acting on instinct.
Awake.
Where am I?
Motel room.
Some anonymous motel room.
But I' il take a look anyway.
Nothing except the Gideon Bi...
Bible.
- (muffled cries) - Just a minute!
(knocking continues) Open the door!
- Hi, Teddy.
- Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?
- Amorous neighbors.
- What are you doing here?
(laughs) You called me.
You said you needed my help.
You know, I' ve had more rewarding friendships than this one.
Although I do get to keep telling the same jokes.
What the fuck is that?
Who the fuck is that?
- You don' t know him?
Should I?
- Wait a minute.
Is that John G?
- I don' t think so.
You don' t think so?
You didn' t write it down?
- I might have fallen asleep before I did.
Ask him.
What' s your name?
- Dodd.
- And who did this to you?
- Who did this to you?
You did.
- No, no.
Just let me think for a minute.
OK, Natalie.
Who' s Natalie?
Natalie who?
- Why?
- Maybe I know her.
Look, we gotta get him out of here.
He' s got to have a car, right?
We take him to his car, tell him to get the fuck out of town or we' re gonna kill him.
We can' t walk him out of here tied up and bleeding.
- How the fuck did you get him up here?
This is not my room.
It must be his room.
Let' s go.
We can' t just leave him here.
- Why not?
Because the maid' s gonna walk in.
She' il see him, call the cops.
We untie him, we clean him up..... and we march him out of here with a gun in his back.
Why would I have a gun?
It must be his.
I don' t think they' d let someone like me carry a gun.
Fucking hope not.
Which one?
You know, teach him a lesson.
- Shut up.
- It' s all right for you, you' ve got the Jag.
All right, get in.
I' m gonna ride with him, you follow us.
Give me your keys.
Take your own car.
So was he scared?
I think it was your sinister moustache.
Should have stolen his car.
What' s wrong with this one?
- Nothing.
So what do you do now?
I' m gonna find out what the fuck that was all about.
Natalie, right?
Who the fuck is Dodd?
And fighting the company' s decision.
But it wasn' t the money that got to her.
Just that his problem was mental, not physical.
She couldn' t understand.
- I did something wrong?
- You did something wrong!
We' re gonna try a little harder.
She looks into his eyes and sees the same person..... and if it' s not a physical problem, he should snap out of it.
- Ellen called.
- I' m trying!
So, Leonard Shelby from the insurance company gives her the seed of doubt.
Just like he gave it to the doctors.
But I never said that he was faking.
I don' t feel drunk.
- Not right now!
Put him onto Teddy or just get rid of him for Natalie.
Get rid of him.
Ask Natalie.
Teddy, Teddy.
Yeah, leave your number, you know what to do.
This is a message for Teddy.
I' m at the Mount Crest Inn on Fifth Street, room six.
I need you to come over as soon as you get this.
It' s important.
Oh, this is Leonard.
Thanks.
Mrs Jankis didn' t understand that you can' t bully someone into remembering.
Well, then, call me back?
So what am I doing?
Oh, I' m chasing this guy.
He' s chasing me.
Dodd, white guy, Mount Crest Inn on Fifth Street.
I' il get the jump on you, you fucker.
Sorry.
I need a weapon.
This' il do.
I don' t feel drunk.
Do I know this guy?
- (car horn) - He seems to know me.
- What the fuck?
- I like your car.
- Thank you.
- Where' d you get it?
- Are you interested in buying one?
What, I haven' t made a strong enough impression on you?
- I wouldn' t be too hard on yourself.
So what am I doing?
Who is this?
- How can you read that again?
- You' ve read it, like, a thousand times.
- I enjoy it.
I thought the pleasure of a book was in wanting to know what happens next.
Don' t be a prick.
I enjoy it.
Just let me read.
Probably burned truckloads of your stuff.
Can' t remember to forget you.
Well, sir, that' d certainly be in keeping with some of my own discoveries.
I was hoping for more on the drugs angle.
Will you hang on a sec?
The police report mentioned the drugs found in the car outside my house.
His prints were all over it.
They gave me a copy.
I dealt with the police a lot in my insurance job.
I can' t keep it all in mind at once.
I have to summarize the sections.
There are pages missing.
I guess I' ve been trying to log them all.
I don' t know why these are crossed out.
They weren' t even looking for John G.
The stuff they found in the car fit in with what they believed had happened,..... so they didn' t chase it up.
Honey?
Honey, it' s late.
Everything OK?
- (muffled gasp) - You OK in there?
(sniffs) Was it good for you?
Was I supposed to lock the door?
I' d like you to leave now.
There' s something about the drugs stashed in the car that doesn' t ring true.
The police claim the guy was an addict needing money to score.
It' s bullshit.
He' s not gonna go breaking into places while he' s still got a stash that big.
Or planted it there.
How do you know that?
It fits.
So he' s a dealer.
Hang on a sec.
Now we' re getting somewhere.
Discount Inn.
Blonde' s fine.
Well, that' s what they say.
The Discount Inn.
304.
Leonard.
Well, what then?
You go into the bathroom and slam the door.
- Yeah.
Loud enough to wake me up.
- And that' s it?
- That' s it.
Yeah, first I just need you to put these things around the room.
Pretend they' re your things and this is your bedroom.
- Should I wear it?
Uh, just like you took it off.
I don' t want you to use it.
I' m sorry.
I just mean put them around the room, as if they were your... your things.
Whatever gets you off.
This is a difficult condition to understand.
His own wife couldn' t deal with it.
I told you how she tried to get him to snap out of it.
I found out all kinds of shit.
How she treated him.
She' d get Sammy to hide food around the house,..... then she' d stop feeding him to see if his hunger would make him remember.
She wasn' t a cruel person.
She just wanted her old Sammy back.
You know all about Sammy and you' ve decided he' s faking.
The company' s position isn' t that Sammy' s faking anything,..... just that his condition can' t be shown to be...
I just want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
We shouldn' t be talking like this while the case is still open to appeal.
- I' m not appealing the decision.
- Then why are you here?
Try to understand, when I look at Sammy, I don' t see some... vegetable.
I see my same old Sammy.
That if I just could say the right thing,..... he' d snap out of it and go back to being normal.
If I knew that my old Sammy were truly gone,..... then I could say goodbye and start loving this new Sammy.
As long as I have doubt I can' t say goodbye and move on.
What do you want from me?
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds..... and tell me if you really believe that Sammy' s faking his condition.
I need to know..... what you honestly believe.
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
Thank you.
I didn' t think it was important what it was.
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?
- Teddy, your buddy.
- Prove it!
Remember Sammy?
- What the fuck are you doing in my car?
What, your sense of humor went with the memory?
Do you know why you' re here?
- Unfinished business.
- Lenny,..... let me inform you, your business here is very much finished.
- You' re still here because of Natalie.
- Who' s Natalie?
Schmuck!
Whose house do you think you just walked out of?
That' s right, take a look at your pictures.
Oh, nice shot, Leibovitz!
You' il want to make a note.
You can' t trust her.
Why' s that?
Because by now she' s taken a look at the suit and the car..... and she' s figuring out ways of turning the situation to her advantage.
She' s already got you staying with her, for Christ sakes.
You can' t go back there.
Let me give you the name of a motel.
That broad' s bad news.
- What do you mean, "bad news"?
- She' s involved with drugs.
See these?
This is the bar where she works.
Her boyfriend' s a drug dealer.
She takes orders for him, arranges meets.
He writes messages on the back of these,..... then she slips him the answers when she serves him his drinks.
- Why should I care?
- Because when she gets jammed up,..... she' s gonna use you to protect herself.
From who?
Guys are gonna wanna know what happened to her boyfriend.
Guys are gonna come after her.
Somebody' s got to pay, Lenny.
Maybe she' il make it you.
Well, maybe she' il make it you.
You worried that she' s gonna use me against you?
- No.
- Why not?
Because she doesn' t know who I am.
- Why are you following me?
- Maybe I wanna help.
She doesn' t know anything about your investigation.
So write this down.
When she offers to help, it' il be for her own reasons.
I' m not lying.
Take my pen, write this down.
Do not trust her.
There.
You happy now?
- I won' t be happy until you leave town.
- Why not?
-.. before people start asking questions?
- What sort of questions?
- Like what?
- Like how did you get this suit, the car?
- I have money.
- From what?
I used to work in insurance.
We were well covered.
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
You don' t have a clue, do you?
You don' t even know who you are.
Yes, I do.
I don' t have amnesia.
I remember everything right up until the incident.
I am Leonard Shelby, I am from San Francisco...
That' s who you were.
You do not know who you are.
What you' ve become since..... the incident.
You wander around playing detective.
You don' t even know how long ago it was.
Let me put it this way.
- I didn' t sell insurance, I investigated it.
You' re an investigator.
- Maybe you should investigate yourself.
- Oh, thank you for the advice.
Look, do me a favor, don' t go back in there.
Will you take the motel out of town?
It' s been fun, Lenny.
Do not trust her.
Don' t believe his lies.
I need my own place.
She shouldn' t have given me that responsibility.
I' m a claims investigator, not a doctor.
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
I' ve got all sorts of other considerations.
Legal responsibility, large financ...
- Who is this?
Write this down.
Write down what happened.
Write it down.
Come on, concentrate.
- What happened?
- He beat the shit out of me.
Who?
Who?
Fuck, Leonard, Dodd!
Dodd beat the shit out of me.
Why?
Because of you!
Because I did what you told me to do, reason with him,...
- Calm down.
Calm down, take it easy.
You' re safe.
It' s OK.
Just sit down.
I' il just get some ice for your face.
I did exactly what you told me to do.
I went to Dodd..... and I told him that I didn' t have any of Jimmy' s money,..... or the drugs.
And that this Teddy must have taken everything.
And what did he say?
He didn' t believe me.
He said if I don' t have the drugs by tomorrow, he' s gonna kill me.
And then he just... he just started hitting me.
Where is he?
- Why?
- I' il go see him.
I' il give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
Oh, he' il kill you, Lenny.
- My wife used to call me Lenny.
Yeah, I hated it.
Oh, this guy is so dangerous.
Let' s just think of something else, OK?
You just tell me what he looks like.
And where I can find him.
Have you got a pen?
In my purse.
He' il, um,... he' il probably find you.
What do you mean?
I told him about your car.
Why?
He was beating the shit out of me, I had to tell him something.
Just write it all down.
Be careful.
I' il be fine.
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?
Front desk?
Burt, right.
This is Mr Shelby in room 21.
Yeah, that' s it, I don' t want any calls.
No, none at all.
- What' s wrong?
- Somebody' s come already.
- Who?
- Calls himself Dodd.
What does he want?
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy and his money.
He thinks I took it.
No.
- What' s this all about?
You' re just blissfully ignorant, aren' t you?
- Look, I have this condition.
- I know all about your fucking condition!
I probably know more about it than you, you don' t have a clue about anything else.
- What happened?
- Jimmy went to meet a guy named Teddy.
He took a lot of money with him and never came back.
Jimmy' s partners think I set him up.
I don' t know if you know this Teddy.
- Neither do I.
- Don' t protect him!
Help me.
- How?
- What?
- Kill him.
I' il pay you.
What do you think I am?
I' m not gonna kill someone for money.
What, then?
Love?
What would you kill for?
- You' d kill for your wife, wouldn' t you?
- That' s different.
- Not to me, I wasn' t married to her!
- Hey, don' t talk about my wife.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want!
I can call your wife a fucking whore and we can still be friends.
- Calm down.
- You can' t get scared!
You don' t know how, you fucking idiot!
This has nothing to do with me.
How the fuck would you know?
You don' t know a fucking thing!
- Hey, can you get angry?
You pathetic piece of shit!
I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won' t have a clue, you fucking retard!
I' m gonna use you.
I' m telling you now because I' m gonna enjoy it much more..... if I know that you could stop me if you weren' t such a fucking freak.
Did you lose your pen?
Too bad, freak.
Otherwise you could write yourself a note about how much Natalie hates your guts..... and that I called your wife a whore!
- Don' t say another fucking word!
- About your whore of a wife?
I read about your condition, Leonard.
Venereal disease.
Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife..... sucked one too many diseased cocks and turned you into a retard!
(softly) You sad, sad freak.
I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won' t remember.
Or maybe even lovers.
I' il see you soon.
Find a pen.
I' m gonna write this down.
Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate.
Keep it in mind, keep it in mind, keep it in mind.
Come on.
I' ve got to find a pen.
I' ve got to find a pen.
What happened?
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.
- Who?
Fuck, Leonard, Dodd!
Dodd beat the shit out of me.
It' s Burt, from the front desk.
I know you said you didn' t want any calls but this guy on the phone says he' s a cop.
- A cop?
- Yeah.
He says you' re really gonna wanna know what he has to say.
I' m not too good on the phone.
I need to look people in the eye.
You can, um, you can crash on the couch.
It' s comfortable.
Just have a seat.
So, how long do you think it' s gonna take you?
You told me you were looking for the guy who killed your wife.
Oh, it depends on if he' s here in town or if he' s moved on.
I have my file here.
If you have all that information, why haven' t the police found him for you?
- They' re not looking for him.
- Why not?
They don' t think he exists.
You see, I told them what I remembered.
Something woke me up.
She' d obviously been gone for a while.
There had to be a second man.
Somebody hit me from behind.
I remember.
It' s the last thing I do remember.
If we check...
The gun and stuff?
John G was clever.
He was clever.
He took the dead man' s gun and replaced it with the sap he hit me with.
He left my gun and the getaway car.
He gave the police a complete package.
They found the sap with my blood on it in the dead man' s hand.
And they only found my gun.
They didn' t need to look for anybody else.
I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts and I had brain damage.
The cops are not gonna believe someone in my condition.
You can stay here for a couple of days if it will help you.
I have to go back to work, so, um, just make yourself at home.
You can watch TV or have some food.
Make yourself at home.
One thing.
- Something to remember you by.
- What' s wrong?
- Somebody' s come already.
- On the house.
My, you really do have a problem.
- Hm?
- Your condition.
Well, nobody' s perfect.
What' s the last thing that you do remember?
- My wife.
- That' s sweet.
Dying.
I remember my wife dying.
Let me, um, get you another one.
I think this one' s dusty.
What do you want?
I know you' re a cop.
What do you want?
Have I done something wrong?
I don' t know, something bad, maybe.
Look, why are you asking me?
I can' t remember what I' ve done.
You wouldn' t believe me anyway.
Because of my condition, you don' t believe someone with this condition.
I didn' t even fucking believe Sammy!
Come by after.
- A beer, please.
- What do you want?
A beer, please.
You can' t just waltz in here dressed like that and ask for a beer.
- What, is there a dress code?
- Why are you here?
- I' m meeting someone called Natalie.
- Well, that' s me.
Yeah, we met before, right?
- Then why am I here?
- I don' t know, why don' t you tell me?
I don' t remember.
I have no short- term memory.
Oh, you' re that memory guy.
- How do you know about me?
- My boyfriend told me about you.
Who' s your boyfriend?
- Jimmy Grants.
Do you know him?
He knows you.
He said you were staying at the Discount.
In fact, a cop came by earlier and was looking for you.
Said he was looking for a guy who can' t remember anything,..... wouldn' t know how he' d got here or what he' d done.
I get a lot of guys round here like that.
Chronic alcoholism is one cause of short- term memory loss.
- Are you Teddy?
- No, my name' s Leonard.
- Did Teddy send you?
- I don' t know.
What' s happened to Jimmy?
- I don' t know that, either.
Sorry.
- You don' t remember anything?
You don' t remember where you' ve been or what you' ve just done?
I can' t make new memories.
Everything just fades.
- Then why did you come here?
- I found this in my pocket.
Your pocket?
Care to contribute?
- No, thanks.
- It' s for a lot of money.
Come on.
Proceeds are going to charity.
Thank you.
- On the house.
It' s completely fucked because nobody believes you.
It' s amazing what a little brain damage will do for your credibility.
I guess it' s poetic justice for not believing Sammy.
You know the truth about my condition, officer?
You don' t know anything.
You feel angry, you don' t know why.
You feel guilty, you have no idea why.
You could do anything and not have the faintest idea ten minutes later.
What if I' d done something like Sammy?
What happened to Sammy and his wife?
She came to see me at my office.
I didn' t tell her what I really thought but I never said that he was faking.
Just that his condition was mental, not physical.
I found out later that she went home and gave Sammy his final exam.
It' s time for my shot.
She knew beyond a doubt that he loved her, so she found a way to test him.
It' s time for my shot.
Or she just didn' t want to live with the things she' d put him through.
It' s time for my shot.
It won' t hurt.
She went into a coma and never recovered.
Sammy couldn' t understand or explain what happened.
He' s been in a home ever since.
He doesn' t even know his wife is dead.
I was wrong about Sammy and I was wrong about his wife.
She wasn' t interested in the money.
She needed to understand his problem.
His brain didn' t respond to conditioning but he wasn' t a con man.
And when she looked into his eyes, she thought he could be the same person.
When I looked into his eyes, I thought I saw recognition.
Now I know you fake it.
You bluff it to get a pat on the head from the doctors.
You bluff it to seem less of a freak.
What drug dealer?
- Hey, Lenny, how you doing?
- It' s private back here.
- It' s OK, we know each other.
- How did you know I was in here?
The Jag' s out front.
What are you still doing here, Lenny?
There' s plenty of tattoo parlors up north.
I guess I wanted to get something down before it slipped my mind.
- Give me the keys, I' il move it.
- It' il be all right.
- Wait out there.
Give me a minute, I' ve got to get something for you.
Fact six.
Car license SG13 7lU.
- We gotta get you out of here.
Oh, man.
- It' s not safe for you to hang around.
- Why not?
Because that cop' s looking for you.
I gotta get you a new identity,..... some new clothes, a different car would do for now.
Put these on.
What cop?
He' s the one that checked you into the Discount Inn.
He' s been calling you for days, slipping envelopes under your door, shit like that.
- How do you know this?
- He told me.
He' s been laughing at you.
- You' re full of shit.
He knows you' re no good on the phone so he' s been calling you up.
Sometimes you don' t answer the phone..... so he slips shit under your door to scare you into answering it,..... giving you a line of crap about John G being a local drug dealer.
Jimmy Grants.
- Leonard, Jimmy' s the drug dealer.
The cop wants to know how his operation is run.
- Somehow you' re involved.
- How do you know him?
He' s a cop from out of town.
The local boys put us together.
If he knew I was helping you, he' d fucking kill me.
So take these clothes, put them on and get the fuck out of here.
Come on, Leonard, just go.
You are full of shit.
Natalie.
Hey, Jimmy.
I' m sorry, I, uh, thought you were somebody else.
Sorry.
That' s OK.
This Jimmy Grants deals drugs out of the bar where his girlfriend works?
He' il come by himself, right?
I always figured the drugs angle would be the best way to get him.
I' m as ready as I' il ever be.
You' re in the lobby?
What do you look like?
I' il be right there.
Officer Gammell?
- Hey, smile.
Not here.
Over here.
You know what?
Don' t write Gammell, just Teddy.
- Why?
- I' m undercover.
This is the directions, where he' s going.
- My number' s on the bottom if you...
- You' re not coming?
Nah, it wouldn' t be appropriate.
Nice picture.
I look thin.
Make him beg.
Jimmy.
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- You Jimmy Grants?
Expecting any other Jimmys, memory man?
- Do you remember me?
- Yeah, I remember you.
Where the fuck' s Teddy?
Strip.
- You' re making a big fucking mistake!
- Strip!
My associates are not the kind of people you wanna piss off.
Don' t say anything else.
- I knew I couldn' t trust that fuck!
- Take it off.
Your pants, too.
- I don' t wanna get blood on them.
Did he tell you what I was bringing?
- Take your fucking pants off!
- Just take it!
- You think you can bargain with me?
- Just take the money and walk away.
- I don' t want your fucking money.
Then, what?
- What do you want from me?
- I want my fucking life back!
How does he know about Sammy?
What have I done?
I need help!
There' s a guy in here, he' s hurt bad.
We gotta get him to a doctor.
- Do I know you?
- No.
Don' t worry, I' m a cop.
- Is he still breathing?
Maybe.
- What the hell were you guys doing?
- I don' t remember, I have this condition.
I hope it' s not as serious as his cos this guy' s dead.
- So you remember me now, huh?
- You are a fucking cop!
- And I' m the guy that helped you find him.
- Lenny, you got the wrong idea!
Who is that?
He knew me.
Of course he did, he raped your wife, he fucked up your brain.
Bullshit!
He' s not the guy.
His name is James F Grants.
John G. Check your tattoos.
- Why did he bring two hundred grand?
- What was it for?
- Amphetamines I told him I had.
- Is this a drug deal?
Yeah, that and your thing.
- How did he know me?
- The Discount Inn.
The guy at the front desk let him know if anybody came round.
He called Jimmy the minute he saw you taking a picture.
- You' re fucking using me.
You get half.
He knew about Sammy, why would I tell him about Sammy?!
You tell everybody about Sammy!
Everybody who' il listen!
"Remember Sammy Jankis?"
Gets better every time you tell it.
So you lie to yourself to be happy.
We all do it.
Who cares if there' s a few little details you' d rather not remember?
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I don' t know.
Her not believing your condition.
The torment and pain and anguish tearing her up inside.
The insulin.
That' s Sammy, not me.
I told you about Sammy.
Conditioning yourself to remember, learning through repetition.
Sammy let his wife kill herself.
Sammy was a con man.
A faker.
I never said that Sammy was faking.
You exposed him for what he was.
I was wrong.
That' s the whole point.
- See, Sammy' s wife came to me...
- Sammy didn' t have a wife.
It was your wife who had diabetes.
My wife wasn' t diabetic.
You sure?
She wasn' t diabetic.
You think I don' t know my own wife?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I guess I can only make you remember the things you want to be true.
- Like old Jimmy down there.
- He' s not the right guy.
He was to you.
Come on, you got your revenge.
Enjoy it while you still remember.
What difference does it make whether he was your guy or not?
- Why?
You' re never gonna know.
- No, you won' t.
- Somehow I' il know.
- You won' t remember!
When it' s done, I will know.
I thought so, too, I was sure of it, but you didn' t!
That' s right.
The real John G. I helped you find him over a year ago.
- He' s already dead.
- Don' t lie to me any more.
Look, Lenny,..... I was the cop assigned to your wife' s case, I believed you.
I thought you deserved a chance for revenge.
I' m the one that helped you find the other guy in your bathroom that night.
The guy that cracked your skull and fucked your wife.
We found him, you killed him.
But you didn' t remember.
So I helped you start looking again, looking for the guy you already killed.
So who was he?
- Just some guy.
Does it matter who?
No reason, Lenny, no conspiracy, just bad fucking luck.
Couple of junkies too strung out to realize your wife didn' t live alone.
But when you killed him I was so convinced that you' d remember.
But it didn' t stick.
Like nothing ever sticks, like this won' t stick.
Just when you did it.
Look how happy you are.
I wanted to see that face again.
- Oh, gee, thanks (!)
- Fuck you.
I gave you a reason to live and you were more than happy to help.
You don' t want the truth.
You make up your own truth, like your police file.
It was complete when I gave it to you.
Who took out the twelve pages?
You, probably.
- No, it wasn' t me, see, it was you.
- Why would I do that?
To create a puzzle you could never solve.
I mean, shit, Lenny, I' m a fucking John G.
- Your name' s Teddy.
- My mother calls me Teddy.
My name' s John Edward Gammell.
There' s plenty of John Gs for us to find.
All you do is moan!
I' m the one that put it all together.
You, you wander around, you' re playing detective.
You' re living a dream, kid.
A dead wife to pine for, a sense of purpose to your life,..... a romantic quest that you wouldn' t end even if I wasn' t in the picture.
- Quit it!
You' re not a killer.
That' s why you' re so good at it.
You know what time it is?
It' s beer o' clock, I' m buying.
I' m just someone who wanted to make things right.
Can I just let myself forget what you' ve told me?
Can I just let myself forget what you made me do?
You think I just want another puzzle to solve?
Another John G to look for?
You' re a John G.
So you can be my John G.
Do I lie to myself to be happy?
In your case, Teddy,..... yes, I will.
Hey, that' s not your car!
- It is now.
- Jesus Christ, you can' t take it!
- Why not?
- Because the guy you just killed owns it!
Somebody' il recognize it.
You know, I think I' d rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.
I might hang on to this for a while.
Will you help me find the keys?
Help me find my keys!
I have to believe in a world outside my own mind.
I have to believe that my actions still have meaning.
I have to believe that when my eyes are closed, the world' s still here.
Do I believe the world' s still here?
Is it still out there?
We all need memories to remind ourselves who we are.
I' m no different.
Now, where was I?
No, man, I' m just saying '- I' m sayin' if- if you own the beach property, right...
- Mm- hmm? - do you own, like, the sand and the water?
Nobody owns the water.
God owns- It' s God' s water.
Let' s say if you do own it.
No, man, you don' t own the beach.
- What you own is sand on the beach, man.
Here, man.
- What if there' s a naked girl on the beach?
That girl' s not yours.
You don' t own the girl.
- What if she breaks her foot on your property?
- She could sue me.
Sue me!
- Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!
- Holy shit!
Ditch it, man!
Ditch it!
- Dude, can you eat it?
- The whole bag?
Fuck it!
Hey, Mike, um, while you' re at it?
- Those are 'shrooms, dude!
- Come on, man, just eat it!
- Mike, uh...
- I can' t eat that!
- No!
Throw it out the window!
Okay!
All right, I' m doin 'a drop.
- Just opening the window.
It' s gone.
- We' re cool.
It' s cool.
- Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck!
- We' re dead!
Windows down!
Windows down!
- Windows down!
Put the windows down!
All right, we' re cool.
We' re cool.
God, did you see that?
It must have been, like, a double homicide or something fuckin 'cool.
- We was freakin 'out, man.
- Man, I almost had a heart attack.
Mike, you didn' t eat both those bags, did you?
- Come and get it.
You must have eaten, like, a hundred bucks worth of pot...
- and, like, 30 bucks worth of shrooms, man.
- Who' s the man?
So, I' m gonna- I' m gonna need 130 buck, you know... whenever you get a chance.
- Fuck, man.
- That- That' s not really cool, man.
Is that the same car, man?
- Yeah.
Here they - Here they come.
- Lick on it.
Just lick it or somethin '.
- Be cool, be cool.
License and registration.
Uh, Officer, I know that -
License and registration, please.
The regis -
- You know how fast you were goin '?
- What?
- How fast you were goin '?
- Uh, 65?
- Sixty- three.

Yeah, it is.
- Where you boys headed?

C- Canada.
We' re goin 'over the border to Canada...

- Poutine.
Canada, huh?
Almost made it.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sure.
- Yes, sir?
- Yes, sir.
- Now, did you say, "Yes, sir"?
- I think he said, "Yeah, sure."
- What' d you say, man?
- Well, I said, "Yeah, sure," but what, literally, I said was, "Yeah, sure, sir."
- So you are okay then?
- Yes, sir.
- You smell somethin ', Rabbit?
- Fear.
Now hand over that registration.
Yes, sir.
My mother' s gonna kill me.
Holy, shit.
This is- This is- This is - Don' t look.
Don' t look.
- Oh, my God.
- I don' t get it, man.
- Am I fucked up or is this fucked up, man?
This shit is fuckin 'crazy.
I was just about to pull out my Nine... and put a cap in that pig' s ass.
- Oh, fuck!
- Oh, my God!
- Shit!
Fuck!
Pull the vehicle over!
- I' m- I' m already pulled over, man!
- Pull over farther, man!
- I can' t pull over - Sir, I' m already pulled over!
- He' s already pulled over!
He can' t pull over any farther!
License and registration, please.
- But I- I just gave you it, Officer.
- License and registration.
You know how fast you were goin '?
- Uh, sixty- five?
- Sixty- three.
I' m freakin 'out, man.
You are freakin 'out, man.
You want to know why I pulled you over?
- Littering.

- Candy bars!
- Littering and- Littering and -
- And, uh - - Littering and -
Littering and, uh- Littering and, uh -
Littering and, uh -
- Littering and smoking the reefer.
Now to teach you boys a lesson, Officer Rabbit and I are gonna stand here...
- while you three smoke the whole bag.
- Please, no.
- Please, yes - - Fuckin' pig!
Mother of God.
Whoo!
We' re in high- speed pursuit of a white Miata headin 'southbound on 2- 9- 4.
Unit 91, come in, 91.
Unit 91, come in, 91.
What are you doing out there, 91?
Quit counting your pubes.
We got a hell- raiser in a white Miata.
Ninety- one, are you there?
Ninety- one?
Ninety- one, are you there?
Hey, good- lookin '.
You catch any speeders today?
- Whoo!
- What the fuck!
- Let' s go, 91.
Rabbit, get that gun out!
Aw, Mac, you fucker!
Greetings.
- You guys are too slow.
- You killed my dummy.
But I shouldn' t, 'cause I knew it was you the whole time.
It sets a bad example.
- Foster, where are your shoes?
- What, are you the shoe police now?
I am, and you owe me 20 laps around the bar.
Let' s go.
- Your black magic only works on the rookie.
- That' s brown magic.
- Pay up.
- When do I get to do that?
You' il get your chance, Rook.
Shots?
- Yeah.
- That' s a lot of booze.
Uh- huh.
- I' m impressed.
- Jesus!
Sorry, boys, you' re on duty.
- On your tab, Officer Womack?
- Rookie, pay the lady.
Come in, 23.
Come in, 23.
Do you need me out there?
Do you need my assistance?
- Shut up, Farva.
- I can be there -
Listen, we got the Miata.
We' re okay.
What about those dopers you picked up?
Do you need my assistance?
- The snozberries taste like snozberries.
- Oh, shit!
- He killed the cops!
- Oh, shit!
- He killed the cops!
- Get out of the car, man!
- This is a cop car!
- Hello.
- You boys like Mexico?
Yeeeee- hoooooo!
One, two, three, do it!
Oh, go, girlfriend.
I' m your mother.
Come on, Thorny.
You' re losing to the rookie.
It' s embarrassing.
Come on, Rabbit.
You can do it.
Oh, Rabbit, he' s killing you.
I got Thorny in front by a lot.
What' s the matter, your mama didn' t teach you how to chug?
Come on, Thorn.
Come on, Thorn.
- Ohh!
- Goddamn it.
I am all that is man.
- Every time.
- Finish it up.
You' re doing it all wrong.
Open your throat, relax the jaw.
Don' t forget to cup the balls.
You' re never gonna win... with those thin little bird lips you got there.
This guy' s got these big old powerful lips.
Am I correct, Thorn?
So much of my authority is derived from the power right here.
Hey, guys.
Wow.
- Uh, do you have any more syrup?
- Sorry, Urs.
- Why couldn' t they chug ketchup?
It' s a good thing you didn' t order hash browns.
I mean, if they had been chugging the ketchup.
You get the score of that Red Sox game last night?
- I turned it off just after - - Ah, waiter.
There you are.
I will have the enchilada platter with two tacos and no guacamole.
- Smy?
- Yeah, Chief, I' il take a chinchilla.
Tacos?
They think I' m Mexican.
You' re not Mexican?
Another highway cop?
What, are you guys multiplying?
Yeah, if they can figure which hole to stick it in.
- Ah, what the fuck?
- Hey, I saw that!
- Sit down, Rando.
- That' s it!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
All right, all right!
- Cut it out, you turkeys!
- He fuckin 'started it!
I' m sorry, Bruce.
These boys get that syrup in them... they get a little antsy in their pantsy.
You just can' t keep them under control.
You should keep these dogs on a leash, John.
Let' s go.
Hey, what' s up, bone diddlies?
Did I miss the song?
- Sing it again, rookie bitch.
Farva.
- Forgot the coffee.
- My bad, Cap.
Let' s get started.
I got the latest shit list, gentlemen.
It' s down to Flagstone, Deer Lick and us.
And if we keep up these low numbers, you can bet your sweet butts... we' re gonna get the big, ugly ax.
- Who' il bust heads on the highway?
- The goddamn local cops!
- And you better believe that Grady and his goons... have got a copy of this list, so we need to step it up.
Who wants cream?
Nobody?
Okay, no cream.
Foster, how many tickets did you issue last week?
- Uh, I don' t have my figures here in front of me.
- Three.
- I can' t make 'em speed.
- Try hidin '.
- And grow a goddamn moustache, why don' t ya?
- I haven' t shaved in two weeks.
- I' m growin 'mine.
- Oh, you' re growin 'yours, are ya?
- I' il tell you when it' s time to grow a moustache.
- Coffee' s served!
Oh, no!
That' s Rabbit' s.
That' s Rabbit' s.
- I get it.
It' s Rabbit' s.
- Oh, look, a bar of soap.
Oh, shit!
I got you good, you fucker!
- Awesome prank, Farva.
- Better than the crap you pull, Frank.
- Look, fellas...
- Bite it, Rook.
Make him look like a dick. every Thursday night I walk into the Lodge to play Hearts... and they always have my Old- Fashioned just waiting there.
- I like that.
- Bite it.
Bite -
Oh, hell!
Give me the goddamn soap!
We got 50 miles of highway.
That stretch of highway is ours.
I' il be damned if I' il let Grady and those buttheads get their hands on it!
Thorny, you' re the ranking officer here.
Let' s do your jobs and keep this place open, huh?
Let' s do it.
Farva!
Your suspension continues.
Hit the radio.
Oh, yes.
Oh, local Smokeys on our turf.
- All right, hit it.
See, that' s what O' Hagan was talking about.
You guys forget what color your car is?
- Bye- bye.
- Later, dude.
- Bye- bye.
- Later, dude.
All right, how about "Cat Game"?
- Cat Game?
What' s, uh, what' s the record?
- Thorny did six...
- but I think you can do ten.
- Ten?
- Starting right meow?
- Uh, sorry about that.
- All right, meow... hand over your license and registration.
- Your registration?
Hurry up meow.
- Oh.
- Sorry.
- There somethin 'funny here, boy?
No, no, no.
Well, then, why you laughing, Mr. Larry Johnson?
- All right meow, where were we?
- Are you saying "meow"?
Am I saying "meow"?
- I- I- I thought - - Don' t think, boy.
- Meow, do you know how fast you were going?
Meow, what is so damn funny?
I could have sworn you said "meow."
- Do I look like a cat to you, boy?
Am I jumping around all nimbly- bimbly from tree to tree?
- No.
No.
- Am I drinkin 'milk from a saucer?
- No.
- Do you see me eatin 'mice?
- Now you stop laughin 'right meow.
Yes, sir.
Meow, I' m gonna have to give you a ticket on this one.
- But - - No "buts" meow.
That' s the law.
It' s not so funny meow, is it?
Meow!
Thanks for washing my car, Rook.
- You know what this is?
- A chamois cloth?
Ha!
Lucky guess.
I just lost a buck... to myself.
- Think that' s funny, do you?
- Yeah, I do.
Also heard something funny about how you got suspended.
Something about a school bus full of kids?
Oh, you heard that, did ya?
Let me tell you another funny story, New Jack.
Back in '7 4... the great Charlie Rich was named Country Musician of the Year.
Then in '75, he had to hand the award off to the new one.
And you know who that was?
Mr. "Sunshine on My Goddamn Shoulders," John Denver.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Can you believe it?
- Wow!
- Replaced by John Fuckin 'Denver.
- Amazing.
- Yeah.
Well, I' il be damaged if Mr. Rich didn' t pull out his cigarette lighter... and light that award on fire in front of everyone.
Do you get it?
So you' re saying you' il set my Country Music Award on fire?
I' m saying when my suspension' s up, you better watch your ass.
Or you' il light my ass on fire?
You wanna go?
Make your first move.
Hey!
I hate to break up the honky convention, but we got a 10- 92.
- You wanna take this one, Rod?
- Hell, yeah!
I bet you do- Ohh!
Nice wax job, Rook.
- Thank you, sir.
- You -
What the hell is this?
We got local pigs runnin 'around?
How' d the locals beat us here?
We' re, like, ten miles out.
Look at this chump.
Oh, Mr. Tough Guy here.
Take a walk, buddy, take a walk.
Holy shit!
It' s a cool Winnebago.
- My Uncle Denny used to have one just like this.
- Rabbit, put your game face on.
You got it, boss.
- Hey, what the fuck?
- Oh- oh!
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, man!
What happened here?
- Take a walk, sonny.
- This investigation is already under control.
- Well, now it is.
- Don' t touch the crime scene, rodent!
Rabbit.
Hey, look at that.
Johnny Chimpo.
- Quit slappin 'me.
- Would you stop touching my rookie, Grady?
- Hey, I' il touch you.
This is the Spurbury Police.
Put your hands up and come outta there!
No dice.
Get your tape.
- Okay.
Let' s cruise.
- Sounds like y' all have a hog problem.
- Oh, watch it, Mac.
Mac, I' m serious.
Be careful, Mac.
He' s angry.
- He' s angry?
Well, hello.
- Hey, mark it off.
- Smy, you mark it off.
- Back it up, Grady.
I' m serious.
What' s the point?
Didn' t you guys get shut down already?
- Oh, yeah, that' s next week.
Your bust.
You know there' s a dead chick in there?
Move it, Ramashit!
- Fight, fight, fight!
Get off of me!
Get off!.
I' il give you the fat guy for Foster and, uh... how about that stupid guy for Rabbit?
Well, you’ re gonna have to be more specific.
- They' re both kinda fat and stupid.
Get these damn handcuffs off now, Ramathorn!
- Cut him loose.
- Go ahead, Smy.
You want to tell me what bug crawled up your big ass, Grady?
Yeah, I will tell you.
We are takin 'it.
- It' s highway.
It' s our jurisdiction.
No.
- This highway is closed.
This is our jurisdiction.
Aw, fuck it.
You deal with the hog.
Hey, Chief.
What in hell' s gotten into you guys?
I told you to be good.
I told you this was a bad time.
But you go ahead and get into a battle royale with the locals at a crime scene.
- But they started that fight.
- Of course they started the fight.
Now they' ve taken a jurisdictional grievance against us.
They want us to blow it.
I mean, a murder on the highway... and you give them the investigation.
Christ!
We look like a bunch of pussies.
All right, come on out, Rabbit.
I guess I just go take a shower then, huh?
Strike three!
You' re out of there!
All right, good cut, Ruthie.
Come on.
Batter up!
Next batter!
Let' s go.
But, Thorn, if they do shut you down... maybe you could stick around here?
I don' t know, get a different job?
You can always come work in my shop.
Yeah, retired cop goes to work for his hippie girlfriend in her head shop.
Too sitcom.
Okay.
You better pay attention, Coach.
Our son' s up.
All right, Arlo.
Watch the ball.
Get a hit.
You got it.
- Let' s do it.
- All right, Arlo.
- Whoa!
- Hey, you gotta keep on your toes.
- Do somethin 'about that, ref.
Sorry- ass local cops.
The next thing you know, they' re trying to take you out.
What?
What?
I don' t wanna get transferred.
- Have to go be a rookie again with a bunch of random dudes.
- Don' t worry about it.
If it happens, we' il, uh, we' il all just stay here, open up a roller disco.
Throw him the heat.
Bring it on.
Uh, anybody want a corn dog?
See if they got any chocolate bananas.
Foster?
Hey, Charlie' s Angel.
Hey, congratulations.
You' re the one millionth person to say that to me.
- Oh.
What do I win?
Um...
There you go.
Hope I don' t get brain freeze.
I' m not sure you' ve got the required equipment.
So, listen, I, um, had a really good time at that Winnebago fight.
Maybe, uh, I don' t know, we could do it again sometime.
All right, all right.
Fair is fair.
You can slug me back if you want to.
- Really?
Okay.
- Yeah.
Hold my snow cone.
- Okay.
- Heads up!
- Hey, what happened over there?
What?
Wh- Why?
How about a little pep, hmm?
From those guys over there.
Assholes.
You want to move that, buddy.
- Yeah, yeah.
I' ve been thinkin 'a lot about that.
I think I might be able to talk to Grady for you.
- Pink stick, eat it or lose it.
- Hey, shut your pie hole, buddy.
I mean, because I' m ready to go out on patrol.
I' m goin 'nuts being on the radio all the time.
I' d like to get some field work.
Yeah?
Why don' t you take your radio and go stand in a field.
Move that gigantic cotton candy!
Goddamn it!
How' s the view from sugar heaven, bitch?
Hi.
I' m looking for Chief Grady.
I have some files for him.
Grady' s not here.
I' il take the file.
- It' s kind of important.
How about Officer Rando?
- Nope.
What do you need?
I' m the only one here?
There are no male officers around?
Just give me the file.
What' s this?
So you originally from Vermont or, uh, or what?
You know, you' ve got a lot of courage, walkin 'into the lion' s den.
- Mm.
You should join the band.
What are your cells, eight by eight?
Ours are nine by nine.
No big deal.
Listen, you seem like a really nice guy, but I just don' t date cops.
I' m not much of a cop, really.
More like a civilian trapped in a cop' s body.
Well, I hear you can get an operation for that.
But then, I guess you' d miss out on all those wacky things you highway guys do.
Yeah, those stories about us are mostly lies, really.
Except for the one about how we pulled over AC/ DC' s bus... and then they flew us down to Jamaica to party with them; that one' s true.
- But, yeah, other than that, it' s pretty boring out there.
Yeah, well, I wouldn' t know.
All right, it' s probably time for you to get out of here.
- I don' t want to get fired too.
- Oh, I' m not getting fired.
I' m gettin 'shut down.
That' s a big difference.
- In our cells, the door is over here.
- Right.
A couple of hyenas.
Well, you know, they are speeding.
- Come in, Radio.
- Don' t call me Radio, Unit 91.
Then don' t call me Unit 91, Radio.
- Are you done?
- Yeah, okay, Radio.
We got a suspicious vehicle.
White Caprice, Vermont plates.
Tijuana- Gringo- Water- Fiver- Zero.
- Roger.
Checking.
- Thank you, Radio.
Unit 91, that license plate belongs to a local Spurbury police vehicle.
It does?
Oh, my God!
- Very funny, 91.
- Thank you, Radio.
Looks like that truck' s planning on skipping the weigh- in.
Yeah, well, you don' t weigh in, you don' t wrestle.
Whoa!
What' s this jack- off doin; trying to pull him over?
There' s no fuckin 'way that is happenin'.
- What the hell' s he doin '?
- I got somethin '.
Yeah.
That' s right, doofus.
Move it along.
You, uh, wanna do "Repeat"?
Do you wanna do "Repeat"?
No.
I' ve been thinking a lot about what the captain said.
- I' d like to play it straight this time, okay?
- Okay.
- For O' Hagan.
- For O' Hagan.
Good morning.
Would you mind stepping down from there with your license and registration?
- Sure.
I was just - - Good morning.
Would you mind stepping down from there with your license and registration?
- Yeah.
No problem.
- Excuse me one second.
No.
Excuse me one second.
No.
Did, uh, I do something wrong, officers... because I know I wasn' t speeding.
- Why didn' t you weigh in?
- Yeah, why didn' t you weigh in?
Did I miss that weigh station?
I just must have dazed out and well -
I' il pull into the next one and get weighed, okay?
What are you pulling back there?
Well, uh, mostly just soap, I think.
Why don' t we take a look?
Listen, Officers, I' m on a really tight schedule.
I really need to -
Let' s go, Mr. Galikanokus.
Well, you heard him.
Let' s go, Mr...
Mr. Galonukum.
Hop on up.
Okay- silly- dilly- dokey- o.
I' m an idiot.
Yeah, that' s true.
Sorry about the light there.
I have a flashlight in the cab.
- Hey!
Mr. Galikanokus!
- Mr. Galikanokus!
- We should have seen that comin '.
- We should have seen that comin '.
- It is time to stop now, Mac.
- It is... time to stop now, Mac?
And that was the second time I got crabs.
- Awesome.
- Afternoon.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- It stinks like sex in here.
What happened?
We got a little distracted by somebody doin 'the "Repeater."
That' il happen.
- That will happen.
Well, you did it this time.
- Fishin 'your car out of Lake Leblanc right now.
- Oh, man.
Nah, we just parked it across the street.
All right, listen.
I want you to stop, take a deep breath...
- and pull your heads out of each other' s asses, would ya?
- Language.
It' s easy for you to say.
He' s got a tiny little head.
Yeah.
What' s this guy movin '?
Yeah.
What' s this guy movin '?
Soap, I think.
Reefer.
Whoo- hoo!
That' s one stinky pyramid.
We should' ve built a stinky igloo and climb in.
- That' s a lot of pot.
- Thinkin 'back to your tour days with the Dead, Rabbit?
- Better lock this shit up, huh, buddy?
- What are you talkin 'about?
Enhance.
Enhance.
Enhance.
Just print the damn thing!
All right, what do we know about this Galikanokus guy?
It' s a fake name, fake license.
- Bunty Soap?
- Fake soap company.
- What, plastic fake?
Decorative fake?
- No, like they don' t exist.
So, we got 150 kilos of marijuana and no arrests.
We got nothin '.
I got a theory, Cap.
These, uh, bales of pot, they have that red Johnny Chimpo sticker on them.
And that dead woman in the Winnebago had the same logo tattooed on her back.
See, a lot of drug dealers use stickers to mark their products.
Like a brand name.
See!
Where' d you learn that, Cheech?
Drug school?
Shut up, Farva.
Did that bag you pulled off those college kids have that sticker?
Um...
I don' t believe it did.
- Was there any marijuana on that Winnebago?
- Nope.
Sounds kinda flimsy.
What' s the significance of this John Chimpo fella?
- Uh, well, you know those really cheap Japanese cartoons?
No?
This is basically a cheaper Afghani knockoff.
It' s this monkey that basically travels around the world... uh, doing nasty things.
His butler tries to keep him in line, but, uh - No.
It' s really funny, Cap.
It' s Afghanistanimation.
The monkey has a butler?
Great.
- Is that what they do in Arabia, Thorny?
- How the hell should I know?
- All right.
Somebody get me a VTR copy of this thing.
I' il talk to Grady, see if he' il let us take a look at the Winnebago.
All right.
You ready for the photo shoot?
Okay, fellas, let' s take it.
- Pull down your pants.
- Shut up, Farva, you idiot.
Come on, do it.
- John.
I' m not interrupting, am I?
- Mad Timber!
- No.
Come in, come in.
- Good work, gentlemen, all the way around.
- Could I get in on that?
- Sure.
Why not?
- Excuse me.
Good work, Officer.
- Hey.
You' re gonna have a hard time shutting us down now, right, Mr. Mayor?
I' m thinkin 'we need as much police as we can get.
- That' d be a good slogan, wouldn' t it?
- Mm- hmm.
Tell that to the budget committee.
I just got off the phone with Governor Jessman... and she' s gonna be swinging through here on her way to Burlington.
- Give me a gun, huh, to hold for the pictures.
- Rabbit, run.
Gun.
- And, John... as far as this brawling with the local police is concerned -
It won' t happen again, Bill.
I' m onto it.
Good.
'Cause when the governor shows up, I' m gonna throw her a little party.
We' re gonna let her know just how this community feels about its law enforcement.
Spread it on!
Come on, Dad!
Faster!
- So what' s the deal with you and Bobbi?
- Come on, Dad!
You guys are goin 'out, but you, um, sleep with other people?
Well, I mean, yeah.
Not really.
Kind of.
It' s sort of a long story, all right?
Well- Hey, Arlo, does Mom ever have any friends over?
- Any older boys?
- Can' t we turn the siren on?
In a minute, all right?
Are you listening?
- Does she have anyone over that maybe you call uncle?
- Like Uncle Fred?
Uncle Fred?
Who' s Uncle Fred?
He' s this crazy bird on TV.
- He' s crazy.
He flies around like a pigeon.
- Oh, right.
Uncle Freddy, he' s great.
He' s a crazy bird.
Okay.
We got one.
You wanna take this one, kid?
- What about you?
- I gotta stay with little "A."
- You' re okay, right?
- Sure.
- Go on.
Make mama proud.
- All right.
Yeah, Farva, I got a Porsche, brown, Washington plates -
- Eight- Donna- Peanut- Eunuch.
- Roger.
Checking.
- Kill it.
Can I please see your license and registra -
I' m sorry, Officer, for the speeding violation.
I am so used to driving on the Autobahn.
Uh- What?... Sean Cassidy.
- Do you know why I pulled you over?
- We were driving way too fast.
- Ja.
- Ja.
Officer, this is a major problem... because I cannot afford another ticket with mein Porsche.
Is there maybe something I can do for you, hmm?
Or maybe my wife... could do for you to avoid this dilemma?
Is there maybe something you would like me to do to you?
Or maybe something you would like to do to me?
Hmm?
Uh, 'cause you were doing 90 in a 65.
Perhaps some spanking or cuffing is in order.
Could you hold on a minute?
Just a minute.
I' il be right back.
- Twenty- three, that Porsche is hot.
- Are you sure?
Rabbit?
- Please, Thorn, not now.
No.
- He can join too, if you like?
- Get over here.
- Tickle, tickle.
- Ja.
- Hold on a second.
Just one second, huh?
- What?
- Farva said that car is stolen.
What?
Stolen?
- Shit!
- Is there a problem, officers?
Hold on!
Come on, Thorn, I need this.
But the car' s stolen.
Goddamn it!
You got to get over there and you got to cuff her.
- Do it!
You' re a highway patrolman.
Cut it out!
Do it.
- Now turn that off and step out of the car, sir.
- This is no problem, hmm?
- Put your hands on the car and spread 'em.
- Ah, now some fun for both of us.
- Get back in the car!
Rabbit, get over there and cuff her.
- Up against the car.
- Ma' am, I hate to do this to you, but would you -
- would you please put your hands behind your back?
- Now things are getting kinky.
- Arlo!
- I love your - - I' m on the radio.
Come in, Farva.
- Arlo!
Rabbit!
Let' s go!
Climb up on Uncle Rabbit' s lap, Arlo, okay?
- I don' t think that' s such a good idea, Thorn.
- Uh, right.
Okay, why don' t you just sit in the middle, buddy?
Ursula, what the fuck?
There' s no T. P. in the bathroom.
- What about the piece stuck to your shoe?
- What about that piece?
Shit!
You know, you might get ahead around here if you made the extra effort.
- Do you want me to wipe your ass?
- That' s not what I -
Well, around my house, my wife knows to refill the T. P.
- No.
And if you were, I' d take you down a peg or two.
Hi, douche bag.
I' d massage your feet every night until you fell asleep.
Nice try.
He strangles her and puts her face in pig food?
What an asshole.
Got any I. D. on the corpse?
Yeah.
"Jane Doe."
Do you know her?
Oh, we' re working on it.
It' s called routine police work.
Apparently, she had a cartoon monkey tattooed on her back.
John Chimpo, I' m told.
And those cannabis bags in our truck... those stickers had the same monkey logo.
So we think there might be some kind of connection.
Are you suggesting that a cartoon monkey is bringing drugs into our town?
- Look, I know we don' t like each other.
- I like you.
Come on!
I' m looking for a little cooperation here.
John Chimpo.
- Hanson, could you round up, uh, Johnny Chimpo... and, uh, Jerry Giraffe and Arty the Alligator and bring them in for a lineup.
- Thanks, sweetie.
- Sounds like they' re having fun.
That' s what happens when you start hanging out with a state trooper.
We show you the funny.
Well, where were we?
Uh, you were laying your best rap on me and I was resisting.
- But you were starting to think about it.
- I told you.
I don' t touch highway hog.
- Baby, I' m Sizzle Lean.
I scratched your back, Bruce.
I scratched it good and hard.
Now, either you scratch my back or you' re gonna get my size ten boot up your ass!
Desperation is a stinky cologne, John.
Let' s see.
You are an expendable line item on a state spending bill.
You have a station full of crappy cops.
And now, you come in here talking about... monkey tattoos on some drunk lady' s tit like it' s a goddamn drug conspiracy.
Keep your bags packed, John.
Let us handle the real police work, huh?
Uh, John, when you do get shut down, you come back, talk to me.
I can always use a good meter maid.
Let it roll.
- Come and get me, Mac.
- See you later, sucker!
- Ohh!
Fuck!
Can' t catch the Rabbit.
- Damn it!
- Out of the car!
Out of the car, scumbag!
Well, hello, Shirley.
- Come on, Farva, man.
Same team.
What' s Thorny going to say, Rook?
- Honestly, Bobbi.
I think it' s gonna happen.
We don' t want to leave.
We really like this town.
I' il probably just get sent down to Brattleboro.
It' s a nice town.
I don' t think it' s a healthy time for him to move.
- He' s got a lot of real good friends here.
Who?
That creepy kid with the lisp?
Stop jumping on the bed.
Look, I don' t want to go without you.
- Then you should stay here.
- But I can' t if they transfer me.
Hey, stop jumping on the bed.
Yippee- ki- yay, motherfucker.
Hey, honey, it' s almost Mitternacht, huh?
Uhh.
We really should be getting back to the jail.
- You don' t want us turning into pumpkins.
Thorn, can' t they just stay a little longer?
All right.
Who wants a mustache ride?
- I want one.
- I do!
I do!
- Spurbury Police.
Thank the Lord.
It' s terrible.
Oh, there' s a disgusting pervert flashing people.
Ma' am, I need you to calm down.
I can' t calm down!
You calm down!
Oh, my God!
- Ma' am, tell me your location.
- He' s right in front of the building... on 323, uh, Karuna Street.
- That' s this address, ma' am.
- Oh, well, then, maybe you can see him.
He' s right in front of the building.
Go look.
I' il hold.
Did you see him?
Oh, he' s disgusting.
- He certainly is, ma' am.
- Oh, I think he' s going to the window again.
Oh, the humanity!
He' s so bulgy.
He' s like a moose.
Oh, no!
I think he' s going back again.
- Freeze, motherfucker!
Oh, God!
Please don' t shoot me.
I- I' m naked.
Drop your coat and grab your toes.
- What?
- I' m gonna show you where the wild goose goes.
Oh, this isn' t happening.
I- I- I' m a police officer.
Ursula, help!
Baby, I' m gonna butter your bread.
You don' t have these at your station?
I don' t suppose you got a pair of fresh underwear I could borrow?
I' m not sure you could fit into my panties.
You know, you can' t tell anybody about this.
- I already told my mom about you.
- Shit!
- Baby, you rocked me.
What is this?
- Rabbit, you' re off the road!
Shut up, Farva!
- It' s a good move, Cap.
Rabbit, you' re on radio.
Farva, you' re ridin 'with Thorny.
- Wait a minute - - What do you want me to do about it?
My hands are tied!
It' s all over the police band!
Rabbit, you couldn' t have picked a worst time!
I got a Q- 17 request form today.
We have to inventory our equipment.
Which means our balls are this close to the band saw.
What are you sellin ', Mac, hot dogs?
- There' s a new billboard.
- Casino le Fantastique?
- Let me guess.
You just humped the mayor' s wife and burnt down City Hall.
I' il do you one better, Captain.
But there' s something funny in the air.
I feel like I just gotta get into that Winnebago.
- So after I jimmy the door, I do a quick recon.
- Bullshit.
I can see there' s something not right about that bed.
- So I busted it in.
- Bullshit.
And just sittin 'there were ten huge duffel bags of these mothers.
Let me get this straight.
You went into the impound, scaled the fence... broke into the Winnebago and smashed the bed, all on a hunch?
I' il believe that when me shit turns purple and smells like rainbow sherbet.
What?
Do you think I just grew this weed?
How could you know to look underneath the bed?
It must have been my sixth - or even my seventh sense.
You know, Rabbit, a good cop doesn' t really know why he does anything.
- Disregard that, Rabbit.
- And you didn' t even think to call in your partner?
So these local mothers have got a hundred keys of chiba and don' t know it?
Not a clue.
It' s totally hidden.
And Grady' s walkin 'around like he' s hot soup.
All right, we got a chance here.
But we got to beat these guys to the punch.
Mac, you and Foster check out the truck stops... and find out what you can about Galikanokus and Bunty Soap.
I' il talk to Grady and play a little hardball.
Thorny, I' m takin 'a hard line.
You got to promise me no more bullshit.
Cap, you know I' m cool, but I can take no responsibility for these white devils.
Well, you' re gonna have to.
Now, Rodney, we' re under a lot of pressure here.
Remember what we talked about.
If anything happens... count to ten, take some deep breaths.
I got it, Cap.
Foster, you’ re on duty.
Trust me, skipper, we' il make you proud.
- You are awesome.
- You are incredible.
You are a fantastic cop.
- Keep goin '.
Uh, and then somebody said, I think it was O' Hagan, said, um...
- "Foster, you deserve a promotion."
I think you get a star.
Mm.
Wait.
I don' t know if this is gonna work.
- This steering wheel is jabbing my ass.
- Oh, right.
Okay.
In New York City, a guy could pay ten bucks to watch two cops have sex in a cage.
Yeah?
- Foster?
- Yeah?
In our cruisers, somebody has to let you out of the back seat.
Oh, fuck it!
Do we look like the two dumbest guys in the world to you?
Is that why you choose to treat us with such disrespect?
Look, all I' m sayin ', man, is switch partners.
It' il be fun.
- I don' t think so.
- Come on, mix it up a bit.
- Mm, no fuckin 'way.
Come on, Mac, you know you' re always sayin 'how funny Foster smells.
- Oh, look out for Thorny, master of psychology.
- Do I really smell?
All right, assholes, quit talkin 'about me.
Lock and load, Ramathorn.
Let' s kick some tail.
- We weren' t talkin 'about you, you big idiot.
- Bullshit.
- Truck stop, huh?
- We gotta do it.
But the captain didn' t say anything about going undercover.
Do you think they' re gonna tell us anything if they know we' re cops?
Look, you' re fuckin 'super cop.
You should know this.
- I am super.
- Plus, we can' t take our car... until they replace the door you, for no reason whatsoever, removed last night.
I told you it was those kids with the wrenches.
Ah, yes, those ballsy little punks who took your car door off... while you were sittin 'in the damn thing.
I told you I was in a very deep sleep.
You wanna tell that to O' Hagan?
Maybe we can borrow his car today.
Do you even know how to drive this thing?
Shit!
This rig sucks!
Aha!
Uh, who knew it was a stick?
How about we, uh, pop a couple of Viagra... and issue tickets with raging, mega- huge boners?
Only you, Farva, can make a dark man blush.
- And, no, we' re not doin 'it.
- Ah, hell.
- Hey, I came up with a great name for our car.
- Oh, yeah?
Get this.
You' re Arcot Ramathorn- Ram - and I' m Rod Farva- Rod; car Ramrod.
Car Ramrod.
You get it?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Rabbit, I got a Plymouth Voyager...
- Say "Car Ramrod."
- Say "Car Ramrod."
- Vermont plates- Hold on.
Vermont plates- Alpha...
God- Mustard - One- Niner- Decade- China.
- Check it.
Roger, 23.
- You didn' t say it.
I wrote it on the paper.
- Oh, I forgot.
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on, Ramathorn, what game are we playin '?
- What?
No games.
- Don' t bullshit me.
Let' s play one of those games I keep hearin 'about.
You know, Mac and Foster... did that thing, you know, with the "who can say pussy the most."
You know, actually, Mac bet Foster he couldn' t say "meow" ten times.
To the driver.
- I realize that doesn' t sound funny as I described - - Who can say "meow" the most?
You guys are real crazy.
Hey, look out for these guys!
I can say "moo."
For 20 bucks, I' il call the guy a chicken- fucker.
Easy, Rod.
Easy, Rod.
Easy, Rod.
Easy, Rod.
License and registration... chicken- fucker!
Brawwk!
- Bruce?
John O' Hagan.
- John!
I' m glad you called.
I have Bobby the Baboon in lockup... and he says that for twenty bananas he' il provide evidence...
Johnny Chimpo is the pimp in charge of the Cartoon Network whorehouse.
Look, I' m done dickin 'around.
We got new evidence on your murder.
Who?
Galikanokus?
You know where he is?
- No, we don' t know where he is, but -
Then I don' t see how you can possibly help us, then.
Okay.
This is my last offer.
Either you let us in on this investigation... or I' m gonna embarrass you personally.
Oh, how embarrassed?
Like, naked in a dream embarrassed?
No, no.
Embarrassed like back in '77, when you got caught fuckin' your cousin embarrassed.
She' s not my cousin.
Welcome to Dimpus.
Can I take your order?
Give me a, uh, double bacon cheeseburger.
Double baco cheeseburger.
It' s for a cop.
- Roger.
- What the hell' s that all about?
- He gonna spit in it now?
- No, I was just tellin 'him that so he makes it good.
Don' t spit in that cop' s burger.
Thanks.
- Roger.
Hold the spit.
Give me a, uh, pie.
Apple.
Do you want me to hold the spit?
Just kidding, Officer... Farva.
So, do you want to "Dimpisize" your meal for a quarter more?
Want me to "punchisize" your face for free?
Some male figure?
I' m his dad.
And stop with the whole transfer thing.
- Oh, Christ.
You know what?
I gotta go.
Let' s talk about this later, okay?
- Okay.
Bye.
- Now don' t give me any lip.
- It' s just a quarter, and look how much more you get.
- I said no!
- It' s just 25 cents.
- Hey, listen, guy.
He doesn' t want it.
- I can handle this, Ramathorn.
- I don' t want it!
- Right.
Uh, beverage?
Gimme a, uh, liter of cola.
- A what?
- A liter of cola!
"Leederacola."
Do we make leederacola?
Will you just order a large, Farva?
I don' t want a large Farva.
I want a goddamn liter of cola!
- I don' t know what that is!
- Liter is French... for" give me some fuckin 'cola before I break both fuckin' lips. "
All right, all right.
Relax!
- That look like spit to you?
- That look like spit to you?
- Yeah.
Ah, fuck it.
I feel like a real cop again.
Well, I wouldn' t get used to it, 'cause you know it' s not gonna last.
- Bullshit.
I' m not goin 'anywhere.
- All right, buddy.
We' re about to get shut down anyway.
Oh, yeah?
That' s a lot of" Dimp. "
- What do you do if you get transferred?
- I don' t know.
I don' t want to leave her and Arlo, so -
Yeah, I don' t know what the hell I' m gonna do.
Who gives a shit?
I' m about to win ten million bucks anyway, right?
What are you going to do with that ten million bucks?
And you can' t say, "Buy the Cleveland Cavaliers."
- I' d buy a ten- million- dollar car.
- Ah, good investment.
- But I' d pull you over.
- Bullshit.
You could never catch me.
- Oh, I could never catch you?
- If you did, I' d activate my car' s wings, and fly away.
I got a good feelin 'about this.
Damn it, you burger punk!
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, Burger Boy!
All right, all right, all right.
Cut it out, you guys.
Knock it off.
Clear out of here.
I' m sorry about the delousing, Rod.
Standard procedure.
- It' s powdered sugar.
- The lice hate the sugar.
- Listen, Rod - - It' s delicious.
Good.
Say, Rod, what are your plans after the shutdown?
We' re not gettin 'shut down, Grady.
Maybe they' re drug busters, but you' re dispatch.
I' m back on the road, now.
- Until this little incident.
Listen, Rod.
This whole murder thing, we' ve been tryin 'real hard to break it open... but O' Hagan just will not cooperate with the evidence.
Now I' ve spoken to the governor myself.
It' s gonna happen.
Now, I' m gonna have a bigger budget then, and I could really use... a good local officer like yourself.
- Could I go now?
- You could have your own car.
Work on exciting cases.
Hey, we could even chase drug dealers together.
I really need to know about your side of the investigation.
O' Hagan' s making all kinds of threats, and -
Can we make a deal?
I' m all highway.
Let him loose.
Sorry about that, bro.
Hey, Charlie' s Angel.
- What' s up?
- Guys.
Hey.
Well, we got about, uh, twenty desk lamps.
- Farva went schizoid.
- That' s good.
- How did the undercover thing go?
- Well, not so good.
- Turns out, this guy can' t drive a semi.
- Yeah.
You guys watch that Johnny Chimpo thing?
- Funny, but nothin 'there.
Maybe you missed something.
Mm, trust me, bro.
There' s nothing there.
Maybe we should take another look.
- That' s it, you' re off the road.
Never again.
- It was not my fault.
- Neither was the goddamn school bus.
You know, there was a time we' d take a guy like you out back and beat you.
- Now you got your goddamn unions.
- I' m not a pro- union guy.
- And you' re banned from Dimpus Burger.
- Damn it!
Get some rubber gloves.
From now on, you' re my cleaning lady.
Beat it!
Well, the butler is basically saying to Johannes Chimpo...
"Don' t let the Great Satan tempt you with the Western culture.
You must remain true to the Taliban warlord. "
So, um, Galikanokus is not the butler?
Well, possibly.
But this is, uh, quite brilliant, really.
And so, Captain, you think there might be some connection with the smugglers?
Rabbit, get this meatball out of here.
You got it, Captain.
Come on, meatball.
Back in the cage with your beautiful wife, huh?
- What did you find out at the weigh station?
- My cruiser weighs 16, 000 kg.
I just got off the phone with Tom McCardle from the budget committee.
- This thing with Farva screwed our pooch.
They can' t lump us in with that fuckin 'Martian.
- We' re all in the same boat.
- But our shenanigans are cheeky and fun.
His shenanigans are cruel and tragic.
- Which makes them not shenanigans at all, really.
- Evil shenanigans.
I swear to God I' il pistol- whip the next guy that says, "shenanigans."
Hey, Farva!
What' s the name of that restaurant you like, with all the goofy shit on the walls...
- and the mozzarella sticks?
- You mean Shenanigans?
- No!
- You' re talking about Shenanigans, right?
Put those away!
- Hey, Rabbit.
"You got beautiful, big brown lips."
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Have your fun, boys.
Have your fun.
'Cause I' m gonna start looking for for a new job.
Hey!
Urs!
Ha!
- Hi.
- Hi.
Sorry I' m late.
- The mayor came down today.
Ah, biker!
I' m an idiot.
Boy, you guys just keep shooting yourselves in the foot.
- Heard you got to see Farva naked.
- Yeah, it was hard to miss.
So, Grady thinks he' s got you guys by the balls.
How do you feel about long- distance relationships?
Think I' m getting sent to Deer Lick.
Well, I' ve been thinking about this.
I think I might have an idea.
The governor comes to town on Saturday for that big thing, right?
She' s gonna make a big speech about drugs and law enforcement...
- and all of that because of your bust.
- She' s gonna shut us down.
Not if you give her more.
Get the reefer out of the Winnebago and give it to her during the party.
- Make a big show of it.
- With all that media there, she would love us for it.
- No way she' il shut you down.
- That reefer' s locked in the Winnebago... which is locked in your impound, which is guarded by assholes.
All right.
Here' s what I' il need.
Five ski masks, a case of smoke bombs- the good ones -
- and banana peels, lots of banana - - Foster?
- How about if I just help you get in?
- You would do that for me?
What the hell.
We' il work together.
- Like Cagney and Lacey.
Well, Cagney and Lacey were women.
- But - - I could be Lacey.
- So that' s it, huh?
- C. C. S. Rockman Bulletproofing is the tops!
Same guys who make our flak jackets.
Now, Rabbit, a good cop does what... before using his equipment in the field?
- Uh, they test it?
- They test it.
Exactly.
How are you shootin 'today, Thorn?
- Dead on all morning.
- How about that little fella?
I wouldn' t worry about that little guy.
- Good enough for me.
You' re my man, now.
I don' t get it.
How are we going to get into the local impound?
There are gonna be cops there.
Most of the local cops will probably already be at the banquet.
They' il leave, like, one or two of the dumbest guys at the station.
- How are you feelin 'there, Mac?
- Good enough to fuck your mother!
So, what we have to do is distract whoever they leave there.
Hey, Mac!
You still have that Halloween costume?
Oh, hell, yeah.
You don' t throw out -
Damn, that' s good!
So, if we can get ten minutes, you and I can get into the impound... get the reefer, and get it to the governor before she leaves?
- Nice and easy.
- I like it.
- You' re up.
- Now, don' t get puke on it.
- Does it hurt?
You' re gonna feel a little pinch.
Lookin 'good, Rabbit!
Now don' t move!
- Hang on, buddy.
- Hey, Captain.
- Bulletproof cup, huh?
I invented this gag, Rabbit.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
And we also used blanks.
You' re a sick motherfucker, Mac.
- Thanks, Chief.
- All right, Thorny.
Why' d you call me up here?
Good to know you' re still battin 'for us with the budget committee, Mayor.
Well, I don' t want to mince words, John, but it doesn' t look too good.
Maybe not to the untrained eye.
But if I was a bettin 'man, I' d put money on us changin' the governor' s mind tonight.
Well, you might want to strap on your ass- kissing boots and start right now.
- I think she' s your only hope.
- Hello.
Humane Society?
- Uh, it' s a drug bust.
- Cocaine?
- Hello.
- Uh, marijuana.
- Then why are we here?
- Oh, I think we' re pretty well covered, Mr. Mayor.
I think she' s got a lot of decisions to make.
- I don' t envy her.
- Oh, I do.
I' il be lucky to have a figure like that when I' m her age.
- Yeah.
That' s a good one.
- We' re sending someone down, don' t worry.
- Thanks.
- No, no, no, no.
We' il bring the guns.
- We' re on it.
We got it.
All right, that' s like twenty calls.
I' il tell you what.
I' il go down there and check it out.
- What about me?
- Burton, somebody' s got to stay here.
All right, fuck it.
Shit!
Maybe this is the key.
- I mean, no offense, bro, but... when did you become a cop?
None taken, Ramathorn.
None taken.
- Really.
How' d you know the key was there?
- A gentleman never asks.
A lady never tells.
Wonder how Rabbit' s doin '?
Yeah!
- Is the bear -
- Is the guy - - Oh, yeah.
Yeah!
- Is the guy - - Oh, yeah.
Seems more of a game warden thing to me.
I know that!
- Whoo!
Oh, shit.
Look who' s here.
- I thought you said he wasn' t gonna make it.
- Glad to see you, Rodney.
- Hey, how are you doin ', Rowdy?
- How you think I' m doin '?
Open bar, ain' t it?
- Thought you said Bowl- a- rama.
- Yeah, I tried to call you, but, um -
Yeah, right!
- Give me six Schlitzes.
- No Schlitz.
- Whatever' s free.
- Take it easy, Rod.
Open bar, dude!
Hello down there.
Are you okay?
Excuse me.
- Bear- Bear- fucker!
- Yeah!
Yeah!
- Do you need assistance?
- Oh!
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Mayor Timber, yeah.
So I just wanted to let you know... that the governor' s gonna have to leave early.
For an emergency fund- raiser.
So -
Aw, she' s gonna speak in about five minutes.
And then we' re gonna have to zip on out of here.
- Well, thanks for the heads- up.
- I' il go check on those guys.
Mac- Attack!
Wanna go punch for punch?
Good one!
I did not specify.
Never shit a shitter.
Lady in blue, comin 'through.
- Ramathorn.
I don' t know.
Two minutes?
You weren' t kiddin '.
That' s a lot of hooch!
Holy shit.
What' s Grady doin 'up there?... and of course, your own local police chief, Bruce Grady... has made yet another astonishing breakthrough... in our state' s War on Drugs.
- That' s fine police work.
Thank you very much.
The real credit... goes to my skilled officers, who uncovered the marijuana in that Winnebago.
And, uh, we have identified the dead woman from that Winnebago... as a drug "queenpin" from Louisville, Kentucky - Lucy Garfield.
Or, as we like to call her down at the station, "The Louisville Smuggler."
There will be no more running of marijuana... through Spurbury on my watch.
- You can count on that.
Farva' s number one!
Farva' s number one!
You showed Grady our secret stash?
That was our stash!
- I did not show Grady the stash!
- Those bags of grass...
- represented a- a bond of trust between us.
- Foster, I had no idea - - Did you pick me because you could manipulate me?
No!
How could you even say that?
- Because you crapped on my heart!
- I what on your heart?
What are you gettin 'out of this?
Is Grady puttin 'you on the road?
No, a- are you - You' re screwing him too.
- Asshole.
- Aah!
- Ursula -
- Oh, Mac.
- What the fuck?
Fuckin 'traitor!
Hey, Mac!
Did it work?
Did it work?
Was there ever a moment when you suspected her?
- No, why would I?
- Exactly.
Why use your head when you can be getting some cop- on- cop fucky- sucky?
Well, did you tell her anything?
Two cops sleeping together.
What the hell do you think they talked about?
Positions and stuff?
Oh, shut up.
You guys don' t even know her.
- Get it through your head, fish dick.
She was in on it.
All right, all right.
Fighting' s not gonna change anything.
Foster, she played you good.
You should have known better.
Well, I guess they' re gonna shut us down anyway.
But you two are friends, you know?
You shouldn' t let this come between you.
Come on now.
Shake hands.
- Sorry.
- You should be.
- Hey!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
- Good, now.
Who wants a shot?
- I do.
- I said, who wants a shot?
- Do you have any openings in Sherburne, Cap?
- Not for you guys.
- Oh, come on.
- We' re like the sons you never had.
I would have smothered you by now.
Smothered me in gravy, you big, dirty man.
- You put in for a transfer yet?
I applied for a guard job.
At the post office.
- Oh, man.
- You' il finally get to shoot someone.
- To the death of fun.
- Here' s to you guys.
What' s up, dirty dogs?
Guess that' s it for the old locker.
She stinks like ass, but I' il sure miss her.
I guess you can say that about all my girls.
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck to you too.
- What are you?
- I' m a cop.
What are you?
- A local cop?
- Grady had an opening.
Big deal.
Why are you wearing that uniform in my station?
Look who' s talkin ', Denim Dan!
You look like the president, chairman and C. E. O. of Levi Strauss.
Where' d you get the Canadian tuxedo?
You ratted us out to Grady.
I' m not even gonna dignify myself with a response to that.
Hey, I got no hard feelings.
Nothin 'a few beers can' t fix, right?
Hey, how about one on me, Ramrod?
Excuse me.
Uh, excuse me, guys.
Yeah.
I' il be right back.
- What the fuck?
- We should have taken him out the back and shot him.
- Aye, aye, Captain.
- I gotta call Ursula.
Fellas, we got to get him back.
He' s gotta pay for this.
- Nobody wears that uniform in my station.
- Farva' s goin 'down!
- Yes!
- Grady' s goin 'down!
- Yeah!
- All of these fuckers are goin 'down!
- What?
Welcome to Dimpus Burger.
May I take your order?
Hello in there.
This is Officer Rod Farva.
- Give me a liter of cola!
- Uh, sorry, Officer Farva, I can' t -
You want me to come in there, boy?
I' il come in there!
- Hello?
- Chase him!
Chase him!
- Let' s pull someone over.
License and registration.
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
We are the Spurbury police!
I' m cool.
I' m cool.
Grady!
Get your ass out here!
- Grady!
- I don' t want to sound like a wienie...
- but I think I should call Ursula.
- You sound like a fuckin 'wienie.
- Gimme the radio.
Grady?
Bruce?
Fuck it, all right.
Gimme the goddamn radio.
- He' s not home!
- Hey, Chief- o!
This is Officer Rod Farva.
Come in, Ursula.
- What' re you doin '?
I love you, Ursula.
- Come in, Ursula!
- Who is this?
Hello?
- Oh!
Oh!
- Oh, she' s there?
Ursula!
Oh, I' m sorry.
Sir, this is a police channel.
Please get off of it.
- I' m tryin 'to apologize here.
- Sir, this is not a civilian channel.
If you' d like to have a conversation with someone, please go to Channel Five.
All right, Thorny.
Pop it over to Channel Five.
Look what I found!
A two- by- four!
- You go, girl!
- Foster!
- Help me out here, Rabbit.
- Foster, is that you?
- I need someone sober.
- You got it, Cap.
- And, hit!
- My ass in your face, Thorny.
- So- So, hey, what' s goin 'on?
Don' t use that boyfriend voice with me.
What are you doing?
Don' t use that boyfriend voice with me, Foster!
- Hit!
- Yea!
Now, did you know that Farva was the one who told Grady about our plans?
I know.
He' s working for us now.
- So, I' m sorry.
- I don' t know.
Can I come see you?
- I love you.
- Listen, Foster - - Ursula!
I' m naked!
- Listen, Foster?
You want to get these guys back?
- Yeah!
- I know a way we can get 'em really good.
- Yeah, let' s get 'em good!
Did you hear that, guys?
- Okay, I get off work at 10: 30.
Meet me at Route 9 and Okeechobee Road, and don' t be late.
- She said, "Okeechobee."
- She' s okey- dokey.
She' s late.
So, Foster...
- is this your usual meeting spot?
- Fuckin 'shit!
- That was Galikanokus!
- Let' s get him!
Outta the car!
Goddamn it!
Same shit, different day, huh, Rabbit?
Everybody outta the car!
I said now!
You' re all under arrest for stealing a Spurbury police vehicle.
No, Farva, you are under arrest for being a total and complete fuckhead!
Y- You don' t want to do this, Rod.
We gotta go catch that truck.
Using what?
Super Citizen power?
Galikanokus is on that truck!
I' il believe that when me shit turns purple...
- and smells like rainbow sherbet.
- Does it sound like that when I say it?
You are not stopping me from getting my job back!
- Get him, Mac!
- I got a job now.
- You' re a local cop.
- You' re goddamn right I am!
- You ratted us out!
No, Thorny.
I barely had a job before.
Farva, get the coffee.
Farva, hit the radio.
Farva, clean the cells!
I' m a cop, goddamn it!
I got my own car, now.
I get to bust criminals!
It' s what I gotta do!
- You screwed us over.
- No, Thorny.
Okay.
Okay, I did!
I did, I did.
- I' m sorry, Rodney.
- Come on, Rod.
- Oh, Thorny!
- No, no, no.
Please.
- Listen, listen.
This is your big chance.
When we go up there, and we' re wrong, no big deal.
But if we' re right, you can be a hero.
Come on.
Team Ramrod!
Will you look at that?
- We got 'em, Cap.
- We got 'em, we got' em!
- Oh.
- Fuckin 'Galikanokus!
There' s Canadian markings on that plane.
You and Rabbit come around in a classic pincer move.
- Mac, I need you to take - - No, no, no, Thorny.
Me and you!
We outflank 'em, and we do, like, a submarine move.
- Team Ramrod?
- Shut up, Farva.
- Farva, you' re leaning - - Wait a minute!
The locals!
I hate those fuckin 'guys!
Goddamn it, you dipshits!
If I had my car, I' d have been in on this bust!
Rodney!
Rodney, get your ass back here!
Here we go again - What the fuck?
- Oh, did you see that?
He kissed that guy!
Holy shit!
God!
We should have known.
So, wait.
The local cops are selling Afghani grass to the Canadians?
- Assholes!
- No, Rabbit, it' s comin 'in from Canada.
Canadian grass.
- Assholes.
- No!
The local mothers are running protection for 'em.
- Oh, I guess I' m the asshole.
- I' m sorry we didn' t wait for you, but -
I need to tell you something.
- What, are you guys drunk?
- Your local buddies are runnin 'grass!
- Listen, I know.
I' ve known for awhile.
- You know this?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you in on it?
No!
I didn' t know what to do when I found out about it.
- I was afraid I' d lose my job.
You should have just told us.
We would have arrested them.
- Yeah, we used to be cops, remember?
- I remember -
No offense, but the less you guys knew, the less you could screw up.
- I was trying to stop it without getting brought down.
Th- That' s why I helped you find the reefer, that' s why I helped you guys steal the Winnebago... and that' s why I brought you... here tonight.
- You didn' t do this because you like Foster?
Shh!
No, I mean - I do like Foster, but I -
- But you used him.
- Yeah, I guess so.
But I really like him now.
Ah!
- This is so good - - This is kind of awkward.
I hate to break up the "like- fest," but it' s prime time for crime- time!
But wait!
Hey, hey, hey!
Are you guys kidding?
Look at yourselves.
You saw what they did to Galikanokus' s girlfriend.
And you guys are drunk, and unarmed.
- Oh, hey, I am sober as a bird.
I am drunk.
- What do you got?
- No guns.
They got flares.
And some string.
Oh, Farva, you sad, lonely man.
- Ugh.
- Oh, wait.
He' s got your name written on it.
- Chief!.
Chief Grady!
- Farva!
Sorry I missed the call.
Looks like we got 'em.
Rock' n 'roll!
What the hell are you doin 'here, Farva?
Put that pistol down!
- Qu' est- ce- que c' est ca?
- Chief!.
- Put a bullet in him, Grady.
- What the fuck is this?
- Grady?
- Shit, what the fuck is this?
- Shoot it!
- That' s my car.
- Grady!
- That' s my girl!
Smy, Burton, check that out.
- What are ya, drunk?
- Drunk enough to kick your ass.
Let' s see what you' ve got, O' Hagan.
Two- time Navy champion.
Tag 'im and bag' im!
- Give my regards to Bobby Baboon.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You haven' t opened it yet, have ya?
- How are ya doin '?
Hey, buddy.
- Hi.
- Hey!
- Hi, John.
- Hi, darlin '.
Here we go.
"Dear John...
"Congratulations are due to you...
"in thwarting the drug- smuggling ring... and extreme police corruption."
- Ooh.
She loves us.
- All right.
"I cannot stress enough how proud we at the statehouse are of you.
"The great state of Vermont could use more officers like your men.
"As you requested, we have reevaluated the financial situation... regarding your unit."
- And we' re gonna buy you a tank.
"going to have to close your station.
"Good luck in Sherburne, John.
"And give your men my best.
"Sincerely...
Governor Fuckhead. "
I did not see that coming.
- I told you to bring the handcart.
- Sorry.
- Tilt it.
Oh, goddamn, I remember these things being lighter!
I think I' m gonna drop a nut!
- Shit.
- Hope they like foam.
- It' s not so bad.
Good exercise.
- Cool uniforms.
All the beer you can drink.
- I' m into that!
Beer!
- Oh, God.
- You order the keg of St. Anky?
Uh, yeah!
But aren' t you guys the Highway Patrol?
Yeah, but our station got shut down, so -
Oh, no shit, man!
Yeah, shit.
This your keg?
Oh, my- my Dad ordered it.
But he' s asleep right now.
Keg' s here!
Oh, St. Anky' s.
- Oh, God.
- No, no, no!
Hey, man.
It' s cool, man.
They got fired!
No shit?
No shit, man!
Where' s the keg go?
- Put it in the rec room, man.
Make room, make room.
What took you guys so long to get here?
What' d you do?
Brew it yourself?
- I am cool.
- You' re cool, man.
Check this out.
Um, why don' t you guys put that, um... over there?
- Move it, move it, move it.
- We want a drink!
Tap this thing!
Actually, you know what?
I think it' s better...
Feng Shui if it' s, uh, over there.
Definitely.
Definitely better over there.
Oh, wait, wait.
Guys.
Guys.
You know what?
Man, it' s probably better for the flow... if you put it back over here.
And don' t forget to tap that keg, guys.
Okay, okay.
Somebody' s gonna need to sign for this... and I need to see some I. D.
Look, you know what?
I don' t have any I. D.
But, uh, Abraham Lincoln here, he says that I' m 21... and he never told a lie.
Yeah, actually it was George Washington that never told a lie.
You guys drive a hard bargain, but -
Actually, you know what?
Why don' t you guys split it?
That was good, man.
- Are you ready for the fun part?
- Oh, yeah.
'Cause here comes the fun part:
Spurbury Police!
- You' re all under arrest!
- Oh, yeah.
All this for a noise complaint?
- I love acid -
Cops.
What the crap?
How come nobody called me?
- We' re in trouble, aren' t we?
- Oh, yeah.
You' re in big trouble.
- We' re in trouble, aren' t we?
- Oh, yeah.
And if you really want to choke somebody, you gotta hit the Adam' s apple.
- Like this?
- Loser!
Farva!
Make a list of everything you want now... and plan on spending the next 25 years of your life getting it.
Slowly, piece by piece.
I see what you' re saying.
But still, I' m looking at you, and you got all this already... and you' re sitting here with me, working with a partner... in the city where you live, on a job that' s gotten more complicated... than you thought it was gonna be.
So I know you' re still taking a shot at something.
I gotta go.
See ya tomorrow.
The maintenance crews come in the tunnels by 6a. m.
I gotta be back in the hole by 5: 30.
As soon as the guards leave, you gotta tell me right away.
- You can' t be late.
- I' m not worried about my end.
I' m wondering how you' re gonna break that safe in half an hour.
You know, I mean --
- Is that even possible?
- Just physics.
- How long is that gonna take?
- Twelve, fifteen minutes, tops.
Fifteen minutes, tops?
Okay.
Okay.
1 5.
- You got no problem at all.
1 5, 5: 30, I' m back in the hole.
- You reset the system.
- That' s perfect.
I' il pack up my shit.
I can meet you here.
- We can go to Max, or I can -- - We' re not gonna meet back here.
- I' il meet you at Max' s, then.
- No.
You' il finish out your shift.
He does his thing.
He pays us off.
We never see each other again.
Forget it.
Just forget it.
I' m gonna come with you to Max' s.
- We' il deliver it together.
- No, you' re not.
Listen.
I' ve done this down to the last detail.
Don' t put me on the sideline when it' s time to collect.
- Don' t do it.
- Listen to me.
You do anything out of the ordinary, you' re gonna get made.
Do you understand that?
Finish out your shift.
- You' re the boss.
- Okay.
Steven got these from a supplier.
They' re throwaways.
Totally untraceable.
People are talking.
They say Max is in trouble with Teddy Salida... and he' s pulling off a big job to get rid of him.
That' s what they say?
Maybe you should walk away from this one.
What are you doing down here?
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
What the hell are you doing down here?
Did you involve Teddy Salida in this?
- What?
Teddy Salida?
- Yeah.
- Why would you say that?
- I see these guys outside.
They look like they might be with him.
How much you into him for?
Four million.
Look, how do you think I got all this?
They gave it to me and the house in Bermuda?
What' s the matter with you?
What' s he know?
- About what?
- About what we' re doing.
Nothing.
I told him I found something that would go for eight... and that we' d split the profits, that' s all.
What are you actually selling the scepter for, Max?
$30 million.
Jesus.
Max, what were you thinking?
What was I thinking?
The same thing you were thinking.
How are we gonna get out from under all this bullshit we' ve been living?
The chance came.
Took it.
- It' s gonna work out fine.
- No, it' s not.
- What do you mean, it' s not?
- It' s not.
It' s a mess.
- It' s not gonna work.
Wait a fucking minute.
This is absolutely clean, Nick.
What are you worried about?
Jesus Christ, it' s my ass on the line anyway, not yours.
I' m not taking the biggest gamble of my life... so I can hand my money over to Teddy Salida.
You think you' re not gonna get your fucking money?
Look, there' s two things you gotta know.
One is you' re gonna get every fucking red cent.
And, yeah, Teddy knows a little.
- He knows?
- He does a little, I said.
- So you did lie?
- Yeah, lied!
Shit happens, man!
Christ Almighty!
I lied for you and I lied for me.
I had to say something to get you to suit up, like always.
I' m sorry, but I' m not gonna do it.
It' s a tiny door.
Open the door.
Take the shit.
Close the door.
We' re out.
There' s too much bullshit around it.
What' s that?
The buyer.
Real simple.
You call him when you get the scepter.
He' il meet you at the airstrip 30 miles up the St. Lawrence.
There' s a little town called St. Croix.
You give him the scepter, he gives you the cash.
You take your cut and you wire me the rest.
I' il give Teddy his, and you' re clean.
It' s too risky.
Can' t.
You don' t know what you' re doing.
You know how long we go back?
Twenty- five years.
I' m gonna tell you something.
For the first time in my life, I' m scared.
I don' t know why it is.
I was never scared before... but I' m scared now, Nick.
And you' re right about Teddy.
He' s gonna blow me away if he can.
If I don' t get him his money, he --
Man, he --
Hey, don' t- don' t- don' t- don' t let me slide on this one.
I can' t afford it, man.
I can' t -- I can' t scrap it out anymore.
I gotta have some slack.
Okay.
I hope you' re not fucking me up.
I' m going down to check the power.
- How much more equipment you got?
- Here you go.
- Sorry!
Sorry!
Sorry!
- It' s okay, Brian.
- Come on in.
- It' s my radio.
- Hey, what' s all the commotion?
- Don' t worry, Danny.
- They' re beefing things up.
- What for?
- A few cameras in the basement.
- Like we' re gonna lose it, right?
- Lose what?
- That thing in the piano leg.
- The big gold thing?
- Some French national treasure.
- It' s called a scepter.
- Some expert saw those pictures.
Now we' re getting calls from the central office.
Hey, it' s me.
Yeah, we got a problem.
They got a camera over the main door here, covering that.
They got a camera here, looking right across the middle.
They got one special just on the box... sees this entire cage.
This camera looking at the box... how high is it from the floor and how low is it from the ceiling?
Probably 1 0, 1 2 feet up off the floor.
Four feet down from the ceiling.
I think we' re fucked.
So let me --
When I' m here... you' il cut the feed when I get across here, then you' il restore it.
Then when I' m ready here, you' il cut it again... and I' il go to work here.
I don' t know about that, man.
They know what it is so now they' re gonna move it as soon as they can.
We' re not gonna get another chance.
We gotta go now or we don' t go at all.
Hi, Doug.
Hi.
- Hi, Henri.
- Hi, Brian.
- Okay.
Thank you.
- No problem.
- Hi, Danny.
- Hello, Brian.
Oh, look at you.
What fancy new shoes.
Yeah.
Yeah, my mom got those for me.
- Oh, your mom gave you those?
- I think you got a girl.
No girl, Danny.
You' re a stinker.
Well, you and your new shoes can give me a hand up on six tonight.
We' re gonna wax the whole cafeteria floor.
You hit the garbage.
I' il get the stuff.
I' il meet you there, what, 1 5 minutes.
Fifteen.
Okay.
Okay, I' il get the garbage, Danny.
Okay?
Bye- bye, Andre.
Bye- bye.
You look good with those shoes.
Yeah, thanks.
I know.
Watch your step out there, Brian.
I will.
Thank you.
Okay, Danny.
- Guess what time it is.
- I don' t know.
Yes, you do, Danny!
It' s lunchtime!
All right, I' il tell you what.
What do you say we keep on working, finish the other side, hmm?
No, Danny.
Why?
Then we can blow off the rest of the day and grab some pancakes.
It won' t take us long.
Just throw a little extra thinner into the mix.
It' il go like butter.
Danny, I am sorry.
It' s okay.
Just leave it.
I' il mop it up.
- I' il go get some more.
- You don' t need to --
- I will get some more.
- All right.
- You know where?
Ground floor?
- Okay.
You know the closet?
Set to go.
Set to go.
Fuck.
Are you there?
I' m on my mark.
- I' m on.
Are you there?
- I' m here.
We' re running late.
I know.
I hit a snag.
I' m already all set up, though.
Just give me one second.
All right, I just gotta punch in these codes.
Just sit tight.
I got it.
Hang on one more beat.
It' s clear.
Get in there.
I' m inside the first cage.
I am inside the first cage.
You' re all clear.
- I' m set.
Kill it.
- All right, on my mark.
Go.
I' m here.
There we go.
Perfect.
Tell me when you' re in second position.
Fuck.
- How ya doing down there?
- Almost there.
Do you know where is Brian?
No idea.
I' m ready.
Hold on.
I' m all set.
Cut the cameras.
Repeat:
I' m all set.
Cut the cameras.
Gotta go.
Got to go.
What' s up?
What' s up?
I got company.
I got company.
Hang on one second.
Just sit tight.
I' il be right back.
Okay.
Jack, where are you?
Jack, come in. Jack.
Jack, are you there?
I' m pulling out.
I' m pulling out.
- I' m back.
I' m back.
- It' s too late.
- I' m pulling out.
- No, it' s not.
We' re good.
Get ready to go.
On my mark.
Go, go, go.
What the hell' s wrong with these machines?
Hey, stop banging on it.
Check the connection.
- You see something?
- I don' t know.
Call them.
Call Ironclad.
- And look like idiots?
- I don' t care.
Call them.
Maybe it' s some of the equipment down in the basement.
Okay.
Thanks.
Someone will be here in a few minutes.
Where are you, kid?
Make a move, make a sound, and you are dead.
Do you understand me?
Turn around.
Be quiet.
I wish you had not come down here, man.
Get over there.
Turn around.
Let' s go.
Turn around.
Walk over there.
Open the door.
Open it.
Get inside.
Look at me.
You' re a good man.
I don' t want to hurt you.
But if you start making noise or try to open that door, I will do it.
Do you understand me?
Stay in there and be quiet.
Everything will be fine.
I don' t wanna wait.
I want you and Tommy to go into the basement now.
Come on, Andre.
I' m watching this.
Laurent, please.
Tommy, get Philippe.
We' re gonna be checking out the basement again.
Hold it right there!
- Are you crazy?
- Take it off and put it down.
- Aw, come on.
- Take it off and put it down now!
- Don' t do this.
- Take it off and put it down!
- Please, don' t -- - Don' t fucking argue with me.
Take it off and put it down.
I can' t.
I can' t.
I' il put the next one in your knee.
I don' t have time to fuck around.
We can work out the details later.
I am leaving with that scepter.
Now, take it off and hand it over right now!
Put it down.
Slowly.
Now, step back.
Back up.
- Take off your mask.
- What?
Take it off!
I don' t have time to play games.
Take it off.
Throw it over there.
Step in the middle.
Step in the middle.
That' s right.
We wouldn' t be here if you' d thrown me some respect at the beginning.
- Just a little bit.
- This is a stupid move.
- It is?
- We all come out ahead.
What are you doing?
Just go up there and finish --
It' s a long shot.
I should play it tight.
You know what I think of your bullshit advice?
I think that' s you trying to talk me into taking a sucker' s share... on a score that I set up from the beginning!
You think I' m stupid, that I don' t see what you and Max are doing?
I mean, what is he giving you?
Five, six million?
Tell me that' s not true.
See, that doesn' t work for me.
I appreciate your help, but you should' ve made me a partner.
Now I gotta take a shot.
Just sit tight.
Just sit tight.
Everything will be fine.
Now you got a choice.
You can either head for that tunnel... or smile for that camera.
Andre, what' s happening?
Get down!
Go to the basement!
We' re being robbed!
We' re being robbed!
Henri, quick!
Go outside!
Wait for the police!
Let' s go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Over here!
Over here!
- He' s in the tunnel!
- Where is he?
Find him!
- Back there!
- Okay!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
- Andre!
- Oh, shit.
- Andre, is there a fire?
- It' s okay.
- Where' s Danny?
- Just get out!
- Okay.
- Just wait outside.
- Just wait outside!
- Okay, bye- bye.
Wait, Brian, wait!
Get back, Brian!
It' s Brian!
It' s Brian!
- Have you seen Brian?
- He' s okay!
He' s outside!
No!
My God, it' s him!
It' s okay.
Attention.
The bus to Albany, New York leaves in five --
Yeah?
- Hey, did you make it?
- Fuck you.
Come on.
I' m just checking to make sure you got out okay.
I knew you' d give 'em the slip.
I' m almost home, too, here, by the way.
Oh, you are, huh?
You sure about that?
Look, whatever you' re thinking about, just forget it, okay?
This is over now and you just gotta deal with it.
It' s not over yet 'cause you don' t know where you' re going, and I do.
- You don' t know shit!
- You know where you' re going?
I' m five minutes from being gone.
You can' t imagine where I' m going.
- You got nothing.
- You know what I got.
You just can' t deal with the fact that I beat you.
Oh, yeah?
Huh?
What have you got?
You know what I' ve got.
Let me ask you something.
When did you start thinking you were better than me, huh?
You still there, ace?
Okay.
Nicely done.
Nicely done.
Now let' s talk about this.
Okay, let' s see.
How' d you put it? "Deal with it.
It' s over. "
No, I don' t think so.
You want me to list the ways I can burn you?
We either work this out right now, or I will take you down.
Oh, yeah?
My shop, my tools, they' re gone.
Me, my friend, I' m just a taxpaying jazz club owner.
You?
Every cop in the city' s looking for you right about now.
So if I were you, I' d quit making threats and hit the road.
Nice working with you, ace.
Okay, bye- bye.
Montreal was stunned by the daring predawn robbery... of the old city' s historic customshouse.
A priceless scepter was stolen.
A senior night janitor... identified this man... as the prime suspect in the burglary.
He was spotted leaving the scene moments after the robbery... and is now the focus of a massive manhunt.
A second suspect vanished from the scene without a trace.
Police have no solid leads.
There are an estimated 8 million people in the five boroughs of New York.
12 million in the greater metropolitan area.
There are almost 10 million telephone exchange lines.
Over 50 phone services.
3 million New Yorkers are cell phone users.
It used to be a mark of insanity to see people talk to themselves.
Now it' s a mark of status.
And speed dial is quickly replacing the drop of a coin.
Despite increased usage of cellular devices...... an estimated 4. 5 million residents and 2 million visitors...... still utilize pay phones on a regular basis.
This is the telephone booth at 53rd and 8th...... perhaps the last vestige of privacy on Manhattan' s West Side.
It is the last booth of its type, still in regular operation.
Up to 300 calls daily originate here.
This location has been burglarized 4 1 times in the last six months.
Verizon has scheduled this structure to be torn down...... and replaced with a kiosk as of 8 a. m. tomorrow.
Hardly two blocks away...... meet the man who is to be the final occupant of that booth.
Donny.
Donny.
Donny, listen to me.
I said I' d get you magazine coverage, and I' m getting you in a magazine.
Look, you gotta trust me.
No means yes to these people.
Get What' s Up? magazine on the line.
Yeah, I heard you.
Donny, I got What' s Up? magazine on the line.
They wanna know about you, so I' m hanging up.
This is Erica or Lars.
I can' t tell the difference.
- You got Stu.
- We said no.
I didn' t hear you, so I' m giving you a second chance.
- We don' t do magicians.
- Magicians?
Donny G is an artist who happens to look like a supermodel.
- The New Guys is offering him the cover.
- New Guys wants him?
And I haven' t told my client, my favorite client...... that I am making this call, all right?
He wants New Guys.
I want you and I can make him come around...... but you' il lose us if I don' t hear from you by end of business.
Get New Guys.
Tell him What' s Up? is offering a cover.
Okay.
Big Q.
Adam, I know three people looking for dog walkers.
That could be you.
"Sit.
Stay.
Don' t worry, Fluffy, I' il clean your shit and wipe your ass. "
- You got Stu.
- What' s up with my party, Stu?
Nice.
Listen.
Seriously, we gotta look at a new night for your release party.
There are two premieres, a fundraiser.
All the happening places are booked.
lf we move the date --
Voodoo on you- do, motherfucker, from Big Q to Big Stu!
- Big Q, be reasonable.
- Motherfucker, I' m a gangster!
- I don' t gotta be reasonable!
- You' re cutting out.
Next time I' m gonna kill your cracker- ass if you keep talking about me like that!
Right?
N. Y. P. D. Blue, 1 1 o' clock.

Bless you.
- ls it you or your boss calling?
- It' s me.
I' m looking for some mutual back- scratching.
You get my privileged N. Y. P. D. Blue info and I get you to save my ass.
Not now, Stu.
I' m a sick woman.
This is going to make you feel better.
Tony- winning producer Jeffrey Sharp tossed his wife back into drug rehab.
Nice.
What do you want for that little tidbit?
You better be nice to me while I' m on the way up and taking your calls.
The higher the monkey climbs, the more you see of his ass.
Have a heart, Lana.
Listen, today my half- wit assistant faxed you regarding my favorite client.
Great singer, about to turn great actress.
- Another little Miss Tits and Ass?
- Look, I' m on cell, no names.
That was strictly in- office information.
You didn' t print it, did you?
- I got it.
- All right, tell me Richard didn' t see it.
He didn' t put it in the column?
Stu' s on the phone, scared he' s gonna lose his job.
His office sent you something by mistake.
He wants it.
You tell him T. F. B. Put that at the top of the column.
- Stu, it ran, sorry.
- Yeah?
Oh, no.
- I' m really sorry.
Yes!
What' s Up? magazine offered Donny G a photo in "What' s Hot and Happening."
- Fuck them.
Make them sweat.
- He' s on a conference call.
He could take a while.
Yeah, can he call you back?
All right, bye.
- Pretty smooth.
- Thank you.
lf you can absorb everything I teach you...... focus and get a new wardrobe, you can make it big in public relations.
- Cool.
Cool.
- Up, T?
- How you doing, man?
Mario' s!
Hey!
Not so fast, Stu!
How come you run every time you go past my place, huh?
- Because I' m busy, Mario.
- Yeah?
Well, no more drinks or free meals, okay?
One lousy mention in the Post, you expect to eat for six months?
No!
Mario, maybe I could throw the hippest party this month your way.
- Stu.
- No, I couldn' t.
My clients would kill me.
- What hip party?
- It' s just Big Q, the hottest new rap star.
- There' il be local TV coverage....
- Nine and 1 1.
MTV, BET, VH1.
But I promised other clients, people who actually pay me.
- No, you owe me.
- It' s gotta be the night of the 1 8th.
Toss in a buffet for 80 people, record company will pick up the booze...... and I will deliver you celebrities.
Anything you want, okay?
Expand the menu, wallpaper those bathrooms, for God' s sake.
You only get one shot with celebrities.
Thank you.
Thank you, Stu!
- That was fucking brilliant.
- Listen.
Call Big Q. Tell him we got him the hippest place in town on his date.
- Call What' s Up?
- Yeah.
We' il take their offer.
- Got it.

Love, Stu.

Love, Stu. "
- All right, no harm being gracious.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Actually, better off, deliver it over yourself.
- Get to know the players.
- I' il do that.
Thank you for teaching me.
- And, Adam, don' t you have a suit?
- Actually, no.
Get yourself one.
- I' m gonna start paying you soon.
- Yeah, I hope so.
- You got a bunch of messages.
- I' m late for a meeting.
Hold them.
- All right.
- All right.
- See you, Stu!
- See you, Adam!
- Excuse me.
- I' m trying to make a call here.
This is for you.
Half- pepperoni, half- mushroom, extra crisp.
You ever heard of delivering a pizza to a phone booth?
I don' t think so.
Gentleman occupying phone booth, 53rd, between Broadway and 8th.
It' s a mistake.
What am I supposed to do with the pie?
It' s all paid for.
There' s a homeless guy around the block.
Give him the pizza and say "You can turn away, but you can' t make it go away."
He' il think I' m trying to poison him.
They always get that idea.
Get off the fucking pizza, all right?
That language is uncalled for.
Holy shit!
I' m sorry.
Please return to sender.
Fuck off.
Eat the pizza yourself.
You look like you could use a good meal.
Hello.
Pam, could you believe some nut case just tried to deliver me a pizza?
Why are you always in the same phone booth, same time, every day?
- Well, it' s quitting time, right?
- Thank God, we were mobbed today.
So how' s your day?
It' s getting better by the minute, sweetheart.
Who' s the most famous person you publicized today?
- You.
- Really?
I told a few columnists Mel Gibson was looking for actresses for his film.
And I said the possibilities were Cameron Diaz, Julia Roberts...... and my favorite client, you.
You didn' t really do that.
First step toward being noticed is being mentioned.
I just got out of a conference at the City Hotel.
I was thinking you could come down.
There are a couple of people and a few martinis I' d like to introduce you to.
- Stu, l -- - Listen, Pam.
Pam.
Pam.
It' s about time we talked about your career.
Come on.
I feel awful but I promised my scene partner that I would rehearse for class.
We' re doing a scene from Jerry Maguire.
I' m playing Renée Zellweger' s part.
That' s great.
Look, I rescheduled a meeting to see you...... but I guess I can reschedule it back.
- Are you mad?
- Don' t worry about it.
I' m not mad.
Maybe tomorrow.
Yeah, later.
- Look, Stu....
- What?
Big kiss.
You too.
- Yeah.
- Isn' t it funny?
You hear a phone ring, and it could be anybody...... but a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn' t it?
What?
I hope you realize how you' ve hurt my feelings.
- Who the fuck is this?
- Don' t think about leaving that phone.
- Wrong number, pal.
- It was a perfectly delicious pizza.
You' re certainly going to wish you had accepted it.
Naturally, this is part of the gag.
That was funny shit.
Well, its purpose was to keep your strength up for what' s coming next.
- What' s coming next is I' m hanging up.
- Oh, no, you won' t.
- You' re going to learn to obey me.
- Obey you?
- Who is this?
- Someone who enjoys watching you.
Watching me?
Yes, I love the suit you' re wearing today.
Black on raspberry sorbet.
Very Italian.
Where are you?
There are hundreds of windows out there.
Why don' t you check them out?
- So, what am I doing now?
- You' re scratching your head.
Now you' re brushing your hair back.
That' s not very nice, Stu.
Did you call me Stu?
- Who' s Stu?
I don' t know any Stu.
- Why, do you prefer Stuart?
A lot of people in this neighborhood know me.
Stuart Shepard, 1 326 West 5 1st Street, Third Floor, front.
- Go mind- fuck some other guy, pal.
- I know Pamela McFadden too.
It' s not in your best interest to disconnect me.
Someone could get hurt.
What' s the matter, Stu?
lf you' re some fucked- up, failed actor I wouldn' t handle...... or some prick intern I fired, I will hunt you down and I will crush you.
You will never work in this town.
I can turn people into gods...... and I can turn you into a total fucking loser if you weren' t one already.
Do you hear me?
Am I upsetting you?
Hello.
Pay you off or something?
- Tell me what you want.
- Now you want to talk to me.
Did Adam at my office put you up to this?
No, I thought this up all by myself.
Keep thinking.
I' m hanging up.
I' il say hi to your wife, Kelly, for you.
Talk to you later.
What the --?
The callback feature cannot be activated --
Motherfucker.
- Tell me what you want.
- I want your complete attention.
- Are you an actor?
- Yes.
One of your pathetic failed ones.
- It' s tough when you' re not known.
- Tell me about it.
You don' t have to hunt me and crush me.
I can' t get work in this town as it is.
I' ve done some off- Broadway, some off- Manhattan plays, but that dried up.
Now I wait tables, clean toilets, anything to make the rent.
I' m a walking cliché.
I can help you.
I can get you auditions.
Auditions?
You' re a publicist.
Yeah, but I have contacts.
I can get you an audition.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Well, there is someone I' d like you to call.
Name it.
Try the number you dialed when you first got into the booth.
- I don' t know what you' re talking about.
- No?
Lucky you then, because I wrote it down.
I can see every number you pressed.
Let' s see if Pam is still at work.
- No.
- Then I guess I' il have to do it.
- Too late.
It' s already ringing.
- I' il put her on speaker so you can hear.
- You' re fucking kidding me.
Stu, I never kid.
- Hello.
- Well, hello, Pam.
- Hi, who' s this?
- It' s a good friend of Stu' s.
- And he hasn' t got many.
- You know Stu?
I know he lies.
- Who is this?
- Don' t worry about that.
Stu' s listening in.
He can hear what we' re saying about him.
- Stu, is that true?
Are you there?
- Pam, hang up the goddamn phone!
She can' t hear you, Stu.
Pam, I' m afraid Stu hasn' t been totally honest with you.
- What do you mean?
- Don' t do this.
- Stu has been lying to you.
- Pam, hang up.
Now, why would a man who has a cell phone...... call you every day from a phone booth?
- Because he said it' s quiet.
- Pam, that' s just stupid.
It' s because his wife checks his cell phone bills.
- No record of his calls to you.
- Jesus Christ.
- He said he wasn' t married.
- Oh, he' s married.
Her name is Kelly.
I' ve never seen her but she sounds lovely.
Why do you think he invites you to the City Hotel?
- Cheap rooms for cheap girls.
- Asshole.
He' s telling you all this so you' il sleep with him.
- He' s lying, Pam.
Don' t listen.
- I know that, okay?
I may be from Montana, but we have men there also.
I wasn' t planning on sleeping with him.
I just don' t know a lot of people here right now.
And he' s cute and he said that he would help me.
- You never asked me if I was married.
- He' s never made anyone a star.
Bye.
Hello?
Back to you, Stu.
Gotta hit this trick before the next bitch takes my score.
- Go away.
- Go away?
Hang up the phone, nigga.
Bitch.
Why are you doing this?
Did I ever harm you?
Did l --?
- Now, let' s call Kelly.
- She' s not home.
Oh, but I' m sure she' s at the shop on Columbus.
How the fuck do you know all this shit?
Speed dial her.
Press "auto one."
That' s her button.
- What am I supposed to say?
- Why don' t you try the truth?
- You' re cheating.
- I' m not cheating on Kelly.
I never have.
- Then what do you call it?
- Look, you' re a guy...... sometimes you want to know it' s a possibility.
It' s like having a beautiful home...... but you still dream of that quick vacation.
You know, some nice hotel room with a great view, maybe a pool.
It' s just a fantasy.
You never leave home.
- Do you hear what I' m saying?
- Kelly is a home and Pam is a motel.
- I' m sure they' il both appreciate that.
- Fuck you.
Hey, that kind of language is uncalled for.
You can' t take up the whole booth.
This here' s my business.
This is not the only phone in New York.
It' s the only one on 8th Avenue that' s working.
- Bullshit!
Go in a restaurant, but get lost.
- Motherfucker, this is my phone.
Get --
Goddamn it, man!
You done made me hurt my dick hand.
I' m sure you' re just as good with the other hand.
Yeah, go away.
I' il be back, motherfucker.
I will be back, bitch.
Get out of my way!
I was worried for you.
I thought she was gonna put an eye out with that hand.
Whoever you are, you' re obviously a very intelligent man.
I know what stress does.
It' s all I can do from going crazy myself.
- You' re calling me crazy?
- No, you' re going through a difficult time.
Look, please don' t call my wife.
Let me give you my office number.
We' il talk.
I know a reasonable photographer who will do some headshots.
Stu, do you really think that I' m an actor?
I' m not an actor.
I have no use for you, Stu.
None.
I would just like you to tell Kelly the truth about yourself.
So are you going to call Kelly and tell her about Pam?
- Or do I have to?
- No!
Jesus, no.
I' m doing it.
Feeling kind of nervous, Stu?
- Hello.
- Hold it to the receiver so I can hear.
- Stu?
- Yeah.
- Where are you?
- I' m in a phone booth.
Baby, I just got this call from this guy who said you' d be calling me...... from a booth to tell me something important.
There' s a lot of prank calling going on today, baby.
- Tell her you invite women...
- Shut up.... to have drinks at discreet hotels.
I' m not talking to you, baby.
Someone' s got company.
- Who' s that woman?
- Bitch got a cell phone!
- Some hooker is trying to use the phone.
- He just called me a hooker.
- Are you sure there' s nothing wrong?
Escorts.
Tell her you want to sleep with other women.
There is this person and he' s saying things about me.
Things that might not be true.
And if he calls you -- Get the fuck out of here before I call the cops!
Honey, I want to sleep with other women.
Look, Kelly, whatever he says, don' t believe him.
- I haven' t done anything.
- Only because Pam had to rehearse.
Shut the fuck up!
Stu, I don' t know what you' re talking about, but you' re scaring me.
I' m sorry, baby.
Can you just come over to the store so we can talk in person?
- I feel kind of weird.
Look, I' il try.
Don' t worry.
- Come on!
- Yeah, bitch!
- I love you too.
- "I love you."
Get out of here before I have you deported to Jersey.
- You' re a fucking ass!
- And you' re a dirty skank.
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Your mama is a skank, bitch!
You didn' t tell your wife the truth, did you, Stu?
And you can tell she really loves you.
Must be nice to have a pretty girl care for you.
Why screw up her life?
She never did you harm.
Everybody does harm.
That' s it.
This mind- fuck is over.
Stu, if you hang up, I will kill you.
What are you going to do about it with your goddamn binoculars?
I never said I had binoculars.
I have a highly magnified telescopic image of you.
Now what kind of device has a telescopic sight mounted on it?
What?
You mean like a rifle?
A. 30- caliber bolt- action 7 00 with a carbon- one modification...... and a state- of- the- art Hensholdt tactical scope.
- And it' s staring straight at you.
- Yeah, how' s my fucking hair?
At this range, the exit wound ought to be about the size of a small tangerine.
Nice try, pal.
Go to hell.
Now, doesn' t that just torque your jaws?
I love that.
You know, like in the movies just as the good guy...... is about to kill the bad guy, he cocks his gun.
Now why didn' t he have it cocked?
Because that sound is scary.
It' s cool, isn' t it?
Look, you shoot a gun here and there' il be pandemonium.
Do you hear me?
There will be cops all over this block.
Do you think so?
Let' s see.
Two.
That won' t help you.
Three.
Stu, look at everybody.
Look at all of the people screaming, Stu.
Here come the cops.
Sniper on the roof.
Gunfire, hit the deck.
Stu, you still with me?
Stand up and be a man.
So do you mean you would whack me for no particular reason?
No, I have plenty of reasons, and you keep giving me more.
- Shall I take care of him?
Shit, no.
It would be so easy.
Here.
Here.
Stu, you just gave that gentleman $1 0 to walk away.
You saved his life.
You do have a sensitive side.
- How much to let me go?
- Let' s see how sensitive you really are.
I' m aiming at you right now.
Can you feel it, the heat of it?
Come now, Stu, you can feel it.
Concentrate.
Concentrate.
Take a look at where I' m going.
You' re doing so much better than the others.
You read about the German porn king shot 1 0 days ago...... at 38th and 8th?
He thought he was an artist and wouldn' t admit he was just a pedophile.
Believe me, he had plenty of chances to come clean.
You must have read about the corporate executive shot at 47th and 1 0th.
What you didn' t read was that he cashed in all of his stocks...... just before the bottom fell out, while all the little guys lost everything.
Now if he had been willing to make amends...... share the money, things might have been different.
Please, tell me, where am I aiming now?
- Below the shoulder.
- Which one?
The right shoulder.
- Love to love you too, baby!
- That' s phenomenal, Stu.
You' re doing so much better than the others.
What do you remember about those killings, Stu?
I don' t know.
Well, you think of yourself as a smart guy, Stu.
- They got shot.
I don' t know, all right?
- Okay, I' il give you a hint.
Wallets, watches, everything was left on their bodies.
They were executions.
They didn' t have to be.
What did I do to deserve this?
Why me?
If you have to ask, then you' re not ready to know yet.
- Right here.
Come on.
- Jesus.
You, in the booth.
- Come on.
- Now what?
You got any idea how much pain you' re making in my life?
- Hey, look at me.
- Look, I hear you!
Look me in the eye.
Hang up the phone and walk away.
- Don' t do it.
- I got my own problems.
I' m your problem.
You know why?
My girls keep yapping at me, "Leon, he won' t share the phone."
"Leon, he told us to fuck off."
"We' re gonna make you nuts unless you make him get off the fucking phone."
- I' m trying to run a fucking business.
- I sympathize, but I can' t get off the call.
No, you don' t understand me.
I got the G- string union here.
They' re breaking my balls.
I gotta live with their shit, but not yours.
So I' m saying this once, nice, all right?
Walk away.
- He did say it nicely.
- He got a cell phone up in there too.
- It ain' t even like he need a phone!
- I can' t get off the call!
Shut the fuck up!
Do you hear that shit?
It' s like nails on a chalkboard.
They ain' t gonna fucking stop, till I get their way.
- I' m getting a fucking headache, pal.
I' il pay you to go away.
I want you to hang up the phone and get out. - $1 20.
It' s all yours.
- Everybody has their price, right, Stu?
You' re gonna give me $1 20 to rent the booth the bums piss in?
- Yeah, I' m a nice guy.
- Something ain' t right with him.
Look at that sweat pouring off that son of a bitch.
- This one sick mother we started with.
- It' s probably catching too.
- Yo.
- He' s got AlDS.
- How long you want to rent the booth?
- lndefinitely.
- lndefinitely?
- Yes.
Do I look like a asshole?
Let me tell you something. - $500 gets you indefinitely.
- Wait up!
Hold the fuck up!
How come he' s defying you, huh?
What, you got bitch in you now?
- Did I say shut the fuck up?
- Yeah, now talk to him like that!
Jesus Christ.
Are you enjoying this?
- Do you need help?
- Look, I' m handling it.
- Come on!
- I can help you, Stu.
I wasn' t gonna kill you before, but you changed my fucking mind.
I would take off if I was you.
He gonna kick your ass.
- He gonna kick your ass.
- Get the fuck out!
Can you get out of here?
Will you go away?
- He looks very angry.
I, look --
- Hang up.
- Get rid of him.
- Hang up the phone!
- We can work this out!
- Get rid of him!
- Hang up the phone.
I got a watch.
It' s a Solaris, $2000 retail.
Yeah?
I got a gold Rolex, motherfucker.
Five.
- Batter up.
- Four.
I can stop him.
Three.
- Just say the word, Stu.
- Two.
One.
Don' t.
Fuck.
This will count as a hang up.
I can make him stop.
Just say the word.
Can you hear me?
- Yes.
- What?
Yes!
- Whose street is this?
- That' s right, baby.
Oh, my God.
Baby, you bleeding?
You must' ve cut yourself --
- What' s wrong?
- You cut yourself.
- What' s wrong?
What' s wrong?
Leon?
Leon!
- He was fucking shot!
- Oh, my God!
- Motherfucker!
- He' s shot!
Leon!
Somebody call an ambulance!
- Call 41 1!
- 91 1, dumb bitch!
He ain' t breathing.
Call the meat wagon!
- Shut the fuck up!
- You shot him.
- Why' d you fucking shoot him?
- You said, "Yes."
"Yes, I can hear you," not, "Yes, kill him!"
You ought to be more careful with what you say.
Oh, my God.
- Motherfucker, why?!
- It wasn' t me!
- Where' s the gun?
Do you see a gun?
- Fuck you!
You pumped one into him, bitch!
I saw it!
He' s got a Glock!
Get the fuck down!
Daddy got a Glock!
What Glock?
I don' t have a fucking Glock!
It' s a telephone!
You shot my man, daddy!
They gonna skin and fry your ass!
You shot my baby, daddy!
Mr. Motherfucker!
Mr. Motherfucker!
Please, come on!
Come in here, bitch!
Better run, motherfucker!
The cops is coming and I hope they fry your ass down!
I' m not going anywhere, am l?
If you had dealt with the man decently, this might not have been necessary.
Look, I offered him money.
I offered him my watch.
But not your respect, which is what he really wanted.
You were dismissive like you dismissed the nice pizza guy.
You are guilty of inhumanity to your fellow man.
I' m not guilty of a goddamn thing.
Take responsibility for what you' ve done, Stu.
Be a man.
I love this fucking spin.
You shoot the guy, and I' m fucking responsible?
Well, looked that way from up here.
I don' t know what I did to you but whatever it was, I' m glad.
I wish it had been worse.
I wish you died!
- Yes, finally some honesty.
- Just tell me who you are.
No one you' d ever notice.
I don' t run in your circles.
- And what is it you do?
- I watch.
- You watch?
- Yes, well, what else is there to do...... when life turns on you and you' ve retreated into some small room?
You look out your window.
You see people come in and out of this phone booth.
The same ones every day.
You make up names for them.
You imagine their stories.
But eventually, you get tired of imagining and follow one of them.
And you hear all of his lies.
And you decide that his sins should be punished.
Some guy shouting into a cell phone full of self- importance isn' t gonna notice me.
But I noticed that German porn king, and I noticed that corrupt executive.
And I noticed you, Stu.
- I' m flattered.
- Operator 553.
What is your emergency?
Will you please respond?
What was so interesting about a guy in a phone booth on 53rd and 8th?
The Stu Show.
Better than TV.
Look, how' d I get so lucky to be picked up by a killer with a rifle?!
You had it made.
Kelly at home, Pam on the side.
I saw Pam once.
I followed her to her restaurant.
Lovely.
Life has given you more than your fair share, Stu.
But it appears you don' t appreciate it.
Look, look, listen, appearances can be deceiving.
I may look confident, but I' m really, actually just crying out for help!
Help!
You know?
I' m trying to help you, Stu, but you won' t help yourself.
- Fuck.
- What' s the matter, Stu?
- You shot me!
- It' s time you learn, Stu.
- Deception!
What fucking deception?
"Are you in need of immediate police or medical response?"
Shit.
You bugged the fucking booth.
That' s how you knew.
That' s how you knew about Pam.
- You picked the wrong person to lie to.
- Look, I didn' t pick you.
It must have been your flashy suit that attracted me.
I get fucked on account of my clothes?
That why you killed Leon?
I didn' t kill Leon because of the way he dressed.
And those other two guys as well?
Did they dress too nice?
You must feel really expensive when you walk out the door.
All right, here come the cops.
What are you gonna do?
Run?
No, I' m not a coward like some people I know.
- You can get away if you run now.
- You' il blame me for Leon.
No, no, I' il confess I shot him with my fucking phone.
Well, then I urge you to keep one thing in mind, Stu.
Take a look at your chest.
You saw how accurate I can be, how lethal.
Kill me now, and you give yourself away.
Not with a silencer.
It would take these guys...... the rest of the day to figure out it wasn' t one of their own men that did it.
You can be shot 4 1 times for pulling out your wallet.
Throw down your weapon and come out with your hands raised.
- Ignore him.
- Yeah, what if they open fire?
They won' t.
Look around you, Stu.
Do you see the tourists with the video cameras?
The ones hoping the cops will blow you away...... so they can sell the tape to The Most Gory Police Shootouts?
Don' t worry, they' il keep the police on their best behavior.
So long as you don' t take hostile action, you should be safe.
Safe?
You call this safe?
I got a whole fucking precinct here with guns pointed my way.
With both hands raised, moving slowly, step out of the booth.
lf we see any signs of a weapon we will respond.
You won' t because there isn' t any!
Put down the phone and raise your hands!
Look, I can' t.
I' m on an important call.
Verify this information for me.
The guy in the booth shot that guy over there...... and stuck around to make a phone call.
Yeah, that' s what the hookers are saying.
All right, give me the horn.
- Sir!
I' m ordering you to fully comply.
- I' m busy, all right.
Come back later.
- Very good, Stu.
- Step out of the booth...... and raise your hands.
I am giving you an order.
I give the orders here, Stu, don' t I?
This guy is looking for us to kill him, captain.
Suicide by a cop?
Well, that' s not gonna happen.
Get that body out of here fast.
Somebody get the body.
Tell the ambulance to get the body.
Thousands of people die every day, but you put one dead body...... in the middle of a busy street and it makes people crazy.
Look at these guys.
You can smell the fear.
- Ten cops.
- This reminds me of Nam.
- Vietnam?
- Yes, Vietnam.
I was too young to go, but I' ve seen pictures.
Well, pictures can' t do it, Stu.
You can' t imagine the fear, the stench.
Napalm- charred bodies, children leaving grenades in your boots.
- Then you got blamed for the war.
- I came home and people spit on me.
Yeah, this country owes you an apology.
Look, I just had this vision of you, of a kid, coming back from the war...... inured to the killing, not able to get work, isolated.
I think that could be made into an affecting story...... and, you know, one that everyone understands.
And I think cops are on the side of vets.
You are pathetic, Stu.
Why don' t you wake up?
Napalm- charred bodies?
I' d have to be 50 to be in that war!
Stop fucking with my head, please!
I' m gonna go talk to him.
Shouldn' t we wait on the ESU negotiator?
They could take 20 minutes.
I' m not gonna take a chance on this one.
I' m gonna handle this.
I' m taking out my weapon.
Putting my weapon down on the car.
- The captain' s going in.
- I' m not armed.
- Yeah, neither am l.
- My name is Ramey.
- Captain Ed Ramey.
- All right.
- What' s yours?
- I don' t want to be friends.
I don' t know.
It looks like you could use a friend right now.
- Tell him you' ve already got a friend.
- I already got a friend.
ls that who you' re talking to on the phone?
Look, I just want to hear your side of it.
That' s all.
I ain' t got no side of it, and I didn' t shoot anybody.
You see a fucking gun anywhere?
Look.
It' s in your back pocket!
I see it!
He been....
Sir, do you have the weapon in your pocket?
No.
I got a cell phone and I got cigarettes.
I got no fucking weapon.
Then what are you doing in a phone booth making calls?
- You want to see it?
Here.
- Hey!
Don' t reach for that!
Hold your fire!
I don' t need to see it.
I know what' s there.
I got plenty of witnesses over here who saw you use it.
They didn' t see it because it didn' t happen!
- Shut them up!
- He' s dead, but it didn' t happen?
- Then who did it?
- Mustn' t tell him, Stu.
- I don' t know.
- You were the closest one to him.
- You must' ve saw it happen.
- No.
- This guy is getting on my nerves.
- Look, stay the fuck out of this.
Who do you keep talking to on the phone?
- Nobody.
- Your friend, your parent, your lover?
- Who?
Careful.
My psychiatrist.
- Excellent.
- I see.
What' s this doctor' s name?
It would be really helpful to us if we knew.
He says not to tell you, all right?
It' s privileged information.
Very good, Stuart.
See, now you' re having fun.
- Yeah, whatever you fucking say.
- I respect your right to privacy.
I' ve been through therapy myself.
The department provided it for me.
I know it' s not good form for a cop to be saying that, but sometimes...... you know, circumstances, stress -- I had issues.
I lost my marriage over it.
Tell him not to come any closer.
Don' t come any closer.
Stop there.
Go back a few steps.
- Go back to where you were!
No problem.
- That' s right.
- So you got some intimacy issues.
I got those too.
All I want to know is, what happened, man?
- Tell him to read you your rights.
- I want you to read me my rights.
Stop asking questions.
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney.
lf you cannot afford one, an attorney will be provided for you.
All right?
So now, can you at least give me your first name?
- Just your first name.
- Don' t tell him.
It' s my right not to have any first name.
- That' s right.
- You' re highly underprivileged.
- Demand your lawyer.
All right?
I want an attorney brought down here to negotiate my surrender.
- Just brilliant, Stu.
- I understand that, but...... it' s gonna be difficult to get a lawyer to come and risk his life.
- Once you hand over the gun -- - How can l?
You won' t let me put my hand in my pocket?
We' il take it out for you.
All you have to do...... is step out with your hands raised.
Nothing will happen to you.
- It' s not gonna work.
- Stu, Stu.
- What?
- Ask him a question.
Ask him if his wife got tired of sleeping with him.
I can' t do that.
- Oh, sure you can, Stu.
Ask him if he couldn' t get it up, if he couldn' t satisfy her.
- Are you gonna step out of the booth?
No.
- You' re not stepping out of the booth?
- Ask him.
- ls that a no?
- Ask him!
- Both your lives depend on it.
- Sir?
Captain, you couldn' t satisfy your wife sexually?
- Excuse me?
- Ask him if he abuses himself now?
- Does he masturbate on lonely nights?
For God' s sake!
Say it!
Say it or I will blow him away!
- So do you whack off now?
- Hey!
I' m gonna see about that lawyer for you, okay?
- Yes.
- Just relax.
- Stu, I think you hurt his feelings.
- I wanna know who' s on that phone.
I want a techie here.
I need to talk to somebody about that phone.
Do you think we went too far, Stuart?
Should we give ourselves up?
Maybe I' d like someone to negotiate my surrender.
- I' m sure we can work that out.
- I won' t just spill my guts to anyone.
Could you get me national news?
I mean, you' ve got connections, right?
- Sure.
- Could you get Larry King down here?
Why the fuck would Larry King come here?
Because you' re friends.
Who else could you get, huh?
Could you get Tom Brokaw?
How about Dan Rather?
Diane Sawyer?
- Look, I, l, I don' t know.
- I, I, I busy.
How about Mike Wallace?
Ted Koppel?
Peter Jennings?
Katie Couric?
Al Roker?
Anybody?
No!
Nobody.
Face it, Stu, you' re smalltime.
And you' ve got a credibility problem.
All right?
What about yours?
Look, it' s our friends from channels two and five.
Your local news, Stuart.
You couldn' t do this for your clients if your life depended on it.
But me, I' ve made you famous.
Stick your head out so they can get a better angle on you.
- How ungrateful.
Those cameras will make the police very careful.
- So come on, smile a little for them.
- Can you tap into that phone call?
- Should be no problem.
- Except...... we' il need a warrant if he' s on the line with his shrink.
Fuck that.
I' m not gonna jeopardize this on a technicality.
Look, tracing, that' s not a violation, right?
- As long as we don' t listen in.
- Okay, this is what I want you to do.
I want you to find who he' s talking to and their current location.
We get that?
I want somebody to find out what' s going on.
Look across the street and see what everybody in New York is looking at.
You' re the man, Stuart.
You' re the center of attention.
Wait till this goes national:
ABC, CBS, CNN, UPN....
You' re gonna hit the whole alphabet, Stu.
I' il be forgotten about in a week.
No one ever remembers the names of the victims.
Right?
Think about it.
You' d be famous.
Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy...... fucking Jeffrey Dahmer.
Name a victim.
You can' t.
Anyway, I don' t deserve to be the center of attention.
- It ought to be you they' re covering.
- That attention would embarrass me.
- I know exactly the spin to put on this.
- How terror inspires your creativity?
Listen, this could be a media frenzy, all right?
You' d get Barbara Walters...... l mean, Larry King if you still wanted him.
That approach seems predicated upon me surrendering without killing you.
Listen, we can make you sympathetic, sit with a writer, bang out a book.
You know, movie of the week.
Get America on your side.
All right, you killed Leon because he was gonna kill me.
All right?
ln a city where nobody looks out for anybody, you took a stand.
I' m your best witness.
So you want me to trust you to get me out of this?
Yes, I do.
I want you to trust me.
Trust me.
Stu, you must think I' m crazy.
- Oh, shit.
Here comes Braman.
- I' il take care of him.
Hey.
Should' ve waited for me to initiate contact with the suspect.
I established a rapport.
Let you know if I need help.
Are you grandstanding for TV cameras?
Or do you want to leave this to a professional?
Until a professional gets here, I' il handle it.
You' re a funny guy.
All right, you get somebody else killed, it' s on your head.
Got it?
This is what I want to do, okay?
This is the City Hotel here.
I want three guys in the lobby here.
And five sharpshooters up here.
See if you can get me two in the subway.
What the fuck?
- Not going to answer it?
- I can' t.
I can' t reach for the phone.
- The cops will think it' s a gun.
- I' il bet it' s Kelly.
She' s probably heard what you did.
She' s sick with worry.
I' m not gonna make her feel any better, am l?
Well, you could ask her to forgive you, Stuart.
You could confess your sins and beg for absolution, come clean.
You' re in this position because you' re not telling the truth.
I' m in this position because you got a gun!
No.
Stuart, that is the sin of spin.
Avoidance and deception.
You' re being given a chance here to make things right.
Now, talk to her.
- Look, I can' t.
Please.
- I am telling you to answer that phone!
- Excuse me!
Excuse me!
- You can' t cross in front of here!
Answer it!
Please.
- Don' t make me hurt you!
- Talk to your wife!
- It' s not her calling.
- It' s you.
It' s you, you miserable fuck!
Damn, you got me!
You continue to impress.
You could shoot me, but you want them to do it!
- Yes, well, that' s an option.
- Yeah.
- Captain.
- Yeah?
This lady says the perp' s her husband.
Here' s her lD.
- I couldn' t believe when I saw this.
- Who do you think he' s talking to?
I don' t know.
I spoke to him earlier today and I told him...
- A man?
Did this upset him, that you were talking to other men?
Yes, he did seem a little upset, but it' s, no -- It' s not like that.
- I didn' t even know who this guy was.
- Who' s his psychiatrist?
- He doesn' t have one.
- That you know of.
I' ve been with him three years, married for one.
I' d know if he was in therapy.
I wish to God he had been.
I saw somebody after my divorce.
It kept me from picking up a gun, doing something I would regret.
- Look, Stu didn' t kill anyone.
- Ma' am, under the circumstances...... you need to consider whether your husband is who you thought he was.
'Cause according to these witnesses over here, he has a gun...... he has used that gun and let' s pray to God that he doesn' t use it again.
Captain?
lf you can think of any dispute he' s having currently, please, tell me.
We' re clearing City Hotel.
I can stage an assault unit within feet of the booth.
We' ve also got sharpshooters securing rooftop positions.
- Let me know when you' re in position.
- Absolutely.
What about that wire tap?
We' re working on it.
You gotta hold tight a while, all right?
- Yeah, no problem.
- Okay.
Mrs. Shepard.
Mrs. Shepard.
- Does he like being called Stuart or Stu?
- Stu.
Call him Stu.
Stu.
Okay.
Come with me, please.
Stu.
I have your wife with me.
That' s how you knew she wasn' t calling.
You deceived me.
- Stu!
- She' s not my wife.
Are you okay?
- Can you just talk to me?
- Yes, talk to her, Stu.
Look, she' s not my wife!
She' s some fucked- up, failed actress I wouldn' t handle.
She' s stalking me!
You are his wife, right?
Yes, here' s a photograph of us together.
I don' t know what he' s talking about.
Stu.
Listen to your wife.
- She only wants what' s best for you.
- She' s not my wife!
Stu, nobody wants to hurt you.
- We just want to know what happened.
- Yeah, very good.
Go home, you fucking lunatic!
You hear me?
Go home!
Please don' t make things worse.
Just come out.
Just do what they tell you to do.
Your wife is a crazy actress stalker and you don' t know her.
- That' s an interesting match.
- Get her out of here!
- Enough.
I don' t want to agitate this.
- You out of your fucking mind?
- Come on, get the woman out of here!
- No.
I don' t know what' s going on.
He' s bleeding -- We -- We' re fine.
This morning everything was fine.
You just stay here.
Just stay here, okay?
- Okay.
- I think she did some good.
- You got a number of that lawyer?
- No, we don' t have a lawyer.
He asked for his lawyer to come negotiate his surrender.
- Well, we never needed one.
- Well, you need a good one now.
Okay?
I' m gonna get your husband out alive.
- I' m not going to let you fuck this up!
- Get Mrs. Shepard out of here.
You know, get her some coffee or something.
You' re gonna lose this guy.
You need some kind of redemption.
- What are you seeing a shrink for?
- Get the fuck out of my face!
- I' m not stepping down!
You okay?
Yeah, I' m fine.
You' d think she didn' t know she was being watched.
- What?
- But beautiful women always know.
- You talking about Kelly?
- That false indifference, superior air...... it' s just a tease.
They want eyes on them.
Why does she put on her makeup, do her hair, dress so nicely?
Not for her husband that she hardly ever sees.
No, it' s for somebody else to notice.
I notice.
What are you doing?
Stay away from her.
Leave her alone.
I' m giving her what she wants.
I bet you' ve never looked at Kelly the way I am right now.
- Don' t you dare fucking hurt her.
- Don' t I dare?
I' m not the one who has hurt her, Stuart.
What they can' t know is what we do to them in our minds.
Right?
- You sick fuck!
- The perfect violation.
- Leave her out of this.
- How many times...... have you had sex with Pam in that hotel bedroom in your head?
Would you really miss Kelly if she was gone?
That' s it.
Not another word.
I' m not talking to you.
Your choices put other people in jeopardy.
When are you gonna learn that?
This is funny.
Stuart, look uptown.
These geniuses are still at the juncture box trying to tap in.
Only I have installed an encryption device at both ends of the line.
There' s no chance of a trap trace...... so now they' ve gotta try some fancy LoJack instrument.
It' s really sad.
I hope you weren' t pinning your hopes on those morons.
Truth is, I' m on a wireless A. D. S. with a cloned number.
It' il take a half an hour to find out I call forwarded through Philadelphia.
And let me tell you, this will all be over before they can get a dial tone.
We can' t get a trace or break into the line.
It' s like a ball of rubber bands.
I knew there was something weird about this.
You keep working on it.
Stu.
Stuart, come on, you' re behaving like a child.
Still gonna give me the silent treatment?
Hello.
Stuart, don' t do this, please.
Come on.
She used to dish this out.
Stuart, please don' t do this.
Stuart, you' re bringing back my unhappy childhood.
Stuart, talk to me!
Please, talk to me!
I can' t take it!
I had a very happy childhood.
Hey, there' s our girl again.
I wasn' t planning on killing her...... but plans change.
Just tell me what the fuck you want from me.
Hello.
There you are.
I thought I was talking to myself again.
I' il do it.
Just tell me.
Tell Kelly about the real Stu, about your little motel.
- And then you' il let us go?
- Why not?
- Kelly!
- That' s a start.
- Baby!
- Hold her back!
- Hey!
- Talk to me!
- Grab her!
Keep her back!
- Yes?
I' m listening.
Kelly, I called some woman.
- Every day.
- Every day.
I was attracted to this other woman.
And I called her and....
- I wanted to fuck her.
- And I wanted to sleep with her.
No.
I wanted to fuck her.
- Say it.
Say it!
- And I wanted to fuck her.
- I' m sorry.
- Whatever you did, I don' t care.
Okay?
That' s all I did.
That' s all I did.
I' m sorry.
All right, I' ve done what you asked.
That' s it.
I' ve had enough of this.
I haven' t.
- You said you' d let us go.
- I changed my mind.
You miserable fuck.
You can' t do this.
You can' t do this to me.
I did everything you fucking asked.
You lied to me.
I' m done with this.
I' ve fucking had enough.
You can go fuck yourself!
Later.
- He hung up.
- Maybe they already got a trace.
ESU, ESU?
- I' m giving myself up!
- He' s coming out!
- Heads up!
- I want to see you toss away your weapon!
Throw the weapon outside the booth!
Stay where you are!
- First, the weapon!
- Don' t hurt him!
Please, don' t hurt him!
- There' s no fucking gun!
- Stay right where you are!
I want you to turn around. lnterlock your fingers behind your head.
- Please give them the gun!
- Kelly, no!
Kelly!
- Freeze!
Get back!
- Get back!
Okay!
I gotta answer it.
Freeze!
Don' t move.
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire.
Hold.
- Please.
Answer it.
- What the fuck are you doing?
He' s coming out!
Answer the phone.
- You fucking coward.
- Hi, Stu.
Now, you' ve had your little tantrum and you said some things in anger...... that I am willing to forget.
Get her back in the car!
I want her in the car.
lf he' s not the shooter, then who the fuck is?
Captain, what the fuck is up with the phone calls?
- So can we start over?
- You lied.
You can' t know the pain of betrayal until you' ve been betrayed.
Sniper in one of these buildings.
I want you to talk to ESU.
I want you to get one of these guys, this building.
Start looking up there from window to window till you find the perp.
Okay?
I want you to do it quickly, and I want you to do it quietly.
Where' s the ESU sergeant?
You said we could go.
- You said you' d let us go.
- Relax, Stuart.
Nobody gets it right the first time.
You' ve done better than others.
You will get a chance to end this.
- I' m just not finished yet.
- Yeah, well, I am.
- There' s nothing keeping me.
- Besides the fear of death?
I dive out and you' ve got one shot.
I' m gonna be dancing.
- You think you can get me?
- I could go for some target practice.
One shot, they look for you.
Second shot, you give yourself away.
Go on, Stuart, hang up!
Trust your fate to friendly men in flak jackets with automatic weapons.
I' m sure you can patch up that little misunderstanding about the dead body.
- Cops can' t prove I killed anyone.
- You had motive.
- No weapon.
- Plenty of loudmouth witnesses.
No gun and I walk.
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
Yeah?
You murder a guy and you forget where you stashed your gun?
Why don' t you lift the plastic ceiling panel and feel around?
Peekaboo!
What' s up next to the florescent bulb?
Check it out, Stu.
Cops see me reach for something, they' il blow me away.
There' s only one way to find out.
Look, the slugs in that dead guy, they came from your rifle.
They' re not gonna match a handgun.
I' ve seen enough cop shows.
Hollow points fragment on impact, Stuart.
There' s nothing to match.
- Only there' s no gun up there.
- Don' t take my word for it.
See for yourself.
There are rounds left in it.
- I totally couldn' t give a shit.
- Come on.
Don' t disappoint me.
Use your imagination.
You' d shoot me if you got the chance, wouldn' t you?
With a big fucking smile on my face.
There' s the spirit.
Now, what if I told you I was just above the theater, four floors up?
See the pink curtains?
There you go, Stuart.
Yes.
Yoo- hoo!
Yoo- hoo!
Why would you do that?
Because it' s fun.
The odds are even now, Stuart.
Isn' t that what you wanted?
You know where I am, and you have a gun.
If you have it in you, you can take me down.
Fuck!
- They' d kill me before I got a shot.
- Oh, you' re probably right.
I' m not really there anyway.
You would' ve just spoiled some nice lady' s curtains.
Looks like someone watches the news.
- Who?
- The motel.
- Oh, God.
- I think she could use a new headshot.
- Don' t!
- Then take down the gun.
- Look, this has nothing to do with her!
- She has everything to do with this.
You' re here and she' s here because you called her.
Now, take it down!
Don' t make me hurt Pam, Stuart.
- Take down the gun!
- Hey, everybody, get ready.
Hold on, hold on.
Let' s just see what he does, all right?
Let' s see what he' s doing.
There' s nothing there.
Nothing but your fingerprints on the finest cop killer money can buy.
- Come on, Stu.
Let' s see it.
- Fuck, no!
It' s staying there.
Fine, then someone will have to take your place.
Come on, Stu, you' re in a perfect position.
- How do you figure?
- You get to choose between them.
Pamela or Kelly?
Should I choose?
One of them can take your place.
Don' t do this!
You' ve got to be more in touch with your feelings.
I thought you only loved Kelly!
- It' s true!
- But you lie to her.
It' s complicated.
Then I' il uncomplicate it, Stuart, by removing temptation.
I say Pam.
No!
Look, this isn' t Pam' s fault.
This is all my fault!
She' s innocent!
Ticktock, ticktock.
Time' s running out.
Okay, Kelly, then.
- You decide.
- No, please!
Come on, Stu.
Don' t you get the game yet?
You' re a selfish guy.
Pick one and save yourself.
Blond or brunette?
Time' s running out.
You or them?
Kelly or Pam?
Kelly or Pam?
Come on, Stu!
Stop this.
- I can' t take this anymore.
- What are you doing?
Get up!
- I was looking for my ring.
Look -- - Get up, Stuart!
Stand up and be a man.
You' re embarrassing yourself.
Captain!
I got it.
Listen.
The rifleman reports subject pulled a small, dark object out of his pocket.
You' re looking at a suicide on national fucking TV.
You gonna let me take this over?
Tell everybody to hold on, to hold their fire.
Everybody hold.
Stay ready, but hold.
- Stuart, you' re beginning to annoy me.
- You can' t do this.
Stu.
No more spinning, no more excuses.
What' re you doing?
Look, listen.
Listen, please listen to me.
No more delays, Stuart.
Look -- I' m on my knees begging you not to kill me.
I will if you keep up this pathetic spectacle.
Excuse me!
He' s on the phone, talking.
From up in your high window, you could kill anyone.
- Yes, I know that, Stuart.
- All right, and....
You could pick off any of the cops, with your rifle.
Shut up and stand up!
Look, why threaten Kelly?
You liked how she sounded on the phone at the store.
Please don' t hurt her.
Don' t fucking hurt my wife.
This doesn' t have to end with me shooting you.
You leave no choice.
- Now, get up!
- All right.
Okay, how does this end?
Tell me how this ends.
The stage is almost set.
People are gonna be eating dinner watching you die.
We got a sniper situation here.
What about that phone call to your store?
I got a phone call this afternoon.
I think it was a prank call.
He told me Stu would be calling me from a phone booth.
How long will it take to get a record of her calls?
lf he' s using that secure line, we won' t know more than now.
Say he didn' t.
Let' s assume he' s a human, makes mistakes like all of us.
I need to get that number.
I' ve been waiting for that number.
It was a guy.
He sounded like mid- 30' s.
Mrs. Shepard?
It would be safer if you got back in the car, okay?
- Please get back in the car.
- Thank you.
I want you to divert incoming ESU units to Broadway and hold them there.
- Want me to clear the streets?
- Yeah.
No, no, no.
I don' t want the sniper to be aware of any of our movements.
He' s already got position on us.
Let' s not let him know we know too much, okay?
- Yeah.
Don' t look up.
Get me sharpshooters looking at those windows.
- You got it, captain.
- I' m gonna buy us some time here.
All right.
Stu!
It' s okay if I come out and talk to you for a second?
- I don' t know.
- This guy is so lonely.
- All he wants to do is talk.
- You' re walking through a bad dream...
- Now he' s really testing my patience.
You wanna wake up, Stu?
I wanna, but I got issues I can' t talk about.
- That your psychiatrist on the phone?
- Yeah, yeah.
I' m paying him overtime.
That was pretty brave what you did.
I mean, admitting all that stuff to your wife.
- It was liberating, right?
- Should' ve been.
Maybe if I could be more honest with my wife then...... l don' t know, something would' ve turned out different.
Oh, please.
- Trust is the key.
You trust me, Stu?
- Get this man a seat on Oprah.
I wanna, but I got the issues I can' t talk about.
Yes, lethal issues.
Tell him to stay back.
Look, don' t come any closer.
Hey, I don' t wanna cause or make anything harder for you.
Pam, Ramey, Kelly, people on the street, you' ve got lives in your hands.
I told you it' s a private conversation.
What the fuck do you want?
I wanna let you know that it' s safe outside the booth.
- It' s not.
- It' s always, "Get out of the booth!"
I like it in the fucking booth!
All right?
It' s my world.
All right?
- Never.
- We' re not gonna force you out...... because there could be some miscalculation...... and then I would never find out why this happened.
Stu, I' m afraid.
We realize that it was just a little black Bible.
- Or a cell phone.
- Don' t push me, Stu.
I' m not gonna let that happen here.
I wanted to make a phone call.
One lousy call --
That' s enough, Stu.
- You got some bad news on that call?
- The worst.
I bet you want to jump off the edge.
- I' ve been falling ever since.
- I' m gonna push him over the edge.
Just say the word.
It' s time to land.
- When you hit bottom, you die.
- I' m your safety net.
Oh, please, say the word.
lf I tell you what you wanna know, you' il die too.
Exactly.
- I' m going.
- Good.
But, Stu, we put a call out to your lawyer.
Your wife, she gave us the number.
And I got my best men working on bringing him down.
Okay?
That' s it.
The captain gets a bullet.
Get out of here!
Hear what I said, asshole?
- Get out of here, go on, now!
- Enough of this sideshow, Stu.
- Your sins have caught up to you.
- So this is all some religious thing?
That explains it.
Bible- crazed killer picks on fashion- obsessed PR guy.
- Tell me what you want, then.
- What everyone wants...... for the bad guy to get what he deserves.
Go for the gun.
- Kill myself?
- Yes.
It would be a rare, unselfish act.
- We got hostile action.
- Nothing is hostile until I say it is.
- Look, I can' t find it.
Bam!
All right!
Look, I found it.
I got it.
- Then let' s see it.
Let everyone see it.
- The cops' il kill me.
Yes.
You' re talking prime- time material now.
- All this shit just to watch me die?
- No.
To get you to do what' s right.
If you wanna save yourself, confess.
- I already told Kelly everything.
- Everything?
No.
No more excuses and half- truths, Stuart.
You look out into those cameras and you bare your soul.
TV seems to help bring out the worst in people.
You should be fine.
- How' re those techs doing?
Anything?
- No, not yet.
Not yet.
Okay?
Stuart, I' m offering you a chance to redeem yourself.
Come on, humble yourself in front of your loved ones...... and millions of strangers and me.
It' s do- or- die time.
What, you couldn' t find anyone worse than me?
Not a murderer or a child molester but a publicist...... who has fantasies about pretty little actresses.
Who spends money on ltalian suits and dry cleaning...... so people think he' s important.
Who doesn' t waste time being nice...... to people who are of no use to him.
These are my crimes?
Stuart, I know your crimes.
Tell them.
I' ve never done anything for anybody...... who couldn' t do something for me.
I string along...... a kid with promises that I' il pay him money.
I keep him around because he looks up to me.
Adam, if you' re watching, don' t be a publicist.
You' re too good for it.
I lie in person and on the phone.
I lie to my friends.
I lie to newspapers and magazines who sell my lies to more and more people.
I' m just a part of a big cycle of lies.
I should be fucking president.
I wear all this ltalian shit because underneath, I still feel like the Bronx.
I think I need these clothes, and this watch.
My $2000 watch is a fake, and so am l.
I neglected the things I should' ve valued most.
I valued this shit.
I take off my wedding ring to call Pam.
Kelly, that' s Pam.
- Somebody got a 20 on this Pam?
- Don' t blame her.
I never told her if I was married, and if I did...... she would' ve told me to go home.
Kelly, looking at you now, I' m ashamed of myself.
I mean, I work so hard on this image, on Stu Shepard, the asshole...... who refers to himself in third person, that I only proved I should be alone.
I' ve been dressing up as something I' m not for so long...... l' m so afraid you won' t like what' s underneath.
But here I am.
I' m just flesh and blood and weakness.
I love you so fucking much.
I take off this ring because it only reminds me of how I' ve failed you.
And, I don' t wanna give you up.
I wanna make things better, but it may not be my choice anymore.
You deserve better.
- You' re not gonna let me go.
- No.
You never were.
I know a thing about lies.
I know a thing or two about liars as well.
Then why the confession?
I didn' t do it for you.
- Right there.
- Yeah, got that.
Captain, captain.
The call to his wife originated at 2: 17...... at a hard line from the old Barkley Hotel.
- You got a room?
- 604.
Second window from the corner.
ESU units holding.
Bring them in from 52nd Street.
Cover the windows, doors, fire escape, every goddamn point of exit.
- ESU, ESU, come in from the 52nd -- - Stu!
- Your lawyer' s coming down now!
- Doors, fire escapes....
Now!
At least you' il die with a clean conscience.
No, you' re the one that' s gonna die!
Listen, you can hear them now.
They' re coming to get you.
Know why?
- Because I sent them!
- You can' t stop lying, can you?
I can' t stop lying?
They' re coming up the stairs.
They' re coming to get you.
Look around.
That room' s getting smaller every second.
lnch by inch!
You know what?
It' s not gonna be any bigger than this fucking goddamn booth!
- They' re in position, in position.
- Get them to move!
- There' s nobody there.
- There' s nobody there?
They' re coming through that fucking door to put you out of your misery.
You got a couple seconds left.
What' re you gonna do?
If this is true, I have to take someone with me, don' t I?
Since Kelly is the most important thing in your life, I' il take her.
Then take me!
Take me.
This is about me!
I' m the fucking one you want!
Take me!
This is about me!
Come on!
It' s me you want!
This is Captain Ramey.
Somebody talk to me.
We' re too late.
The psycho heard us coming...... and slashed his throat with a knife.
- What' s his condition?
- Critical.
He' s lost a lot of blood.
Get him down here.
I don' t want nobody dying on me.
All right.
- Kelly, where' s Kelly?
- Your wife' s fine, all right?
All right, try not to sit up.
- What hit me?
- Rubber bullet.
Figured if somebody' s gonna shoot you, it might as well be us.
Thanks.
- Did you get him?
- You did.
- I didn' t do anything.
- Give yourself some credit.
Got yourself out alive.
Doesn' t always happen that way.
- Are you okay?
I' m okay.
I was so afraid.
I thought I wasn' t ever gonna see you again.
Me too.
We' ve got things to talk about.
I only want to talk about what you want to tell me.
I want to tell you everything.
Everything.
Get over here.
We lost him.
- I want to stand up.
- I got him.
- Sure you can hold on?
- I gotta see him.
- You don' t want to see this.
- Yes, I do.
- Take it easy.
- Yes, I do.
Allow me.
- Go ahead.
You recognize him?
Yeah.
He was down here trying to deliver me a pizza...... 10 minutes before I got the call.
I told him to fuck off.
That' s enough these days.
We' il be driving, and you' il be flying.
Whatever you say.
What a piece of shit.
Nice shoes.
ltalian.
You hung up, Stu.
I didn' t get a chance to say goodbye.
I feel bad about the pizza guy.
But I couldn' t miss seeing you and Kelly reunited.
You don' t have to thank me.
Nobody ever does.
I just hope your newfound honesty lasts.
Because it if doesn' t, you' il be hearing from me.
Isn' t it funny?
But a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn' t it?
Doesn' t it?
Hello?
B L I Z Z A R D
Here.
This is Walter.
Leave a message, wait for the beep.
Will, you there?
Where else can you go in that state?
You must' ve been freezing.
If you want, take a shower.
There are clean towels in the bathroom.
This is Walter.
Leave a message, wait for the beep.
Will, pick up.
"I' m not dumb enough to come back" --
- Walter Finch.
- "Will."
Will Dormer, what are you doing?
I try to help and you' re running around like a maniac.
Were you gonna kill me?
How would you explain that?
No one gets too upset when child murderers are brought in feet first.
There' s no evidence I killed Kay.
You know because I told you.
- "Come on.
What' s wrong with you? "
- Guess I' m a little cranky.
- "Get some rest, will you?"
Got some pills, and my bed' s nice and comfy.
Another night up and you' il lose it.
Hallucinating, babbling.
Tomorrow when you feel better, we' il meet in public.
We' il sort it out.
There' s a ferry north of Nightmute.
I' il be on the 11: 00.
They' re on a diet.
Dormer?
Fax from the lab.
Weapon was a. 38 Smith & Wesson.
- We found something that might -- - I found this.
At the Connells'.
And?
It' s the author of the book we found in Kay' s bag.
It' s signed by the author.
He' s a local.
Kay had all his books.
We should check it out.
- Small stuff, right?
- Yeah.
Sure, sure.
Nice work, Ellie.
She' s got sharp eyes, huh?
You bet your ass she does.
Good stuff.
What a view.
- I' m not who you think I am.
- No?
Walter Finch:
Lousy writer.
Lonely freak.
Murderer.
No?
When I was 7, my grandmother took me to Portland.
We were walking along and two guys snatched her purse.
A police officer came to ask questions.
He stood the whole time.
Uniform looked brand- new.
Shoes, badge were polished.
It was like a soldier, only better.
I respect your profession.
I write about it.
I wanted to become a cop after school.
I couldn' t pass all the tests.
You should' ve tried Internal Affairs.
They' d have taken you.
What do you want from me?
After Kay died, I knew everyone would think I meant to do it.
So I cleaned the body, removed all evidence connecting it to me.
Except for your fucking novel.
You don' t always see the wood for the trees.
You, for one, should have figured that out by now.
When I heard they had brought somebody from L. A., I panicked.
I could handle them.
They never look in the eyes of a killer.
Killing changes you.
You know that.
It' s not guilt.
I never meant to do it.
It' s like awareness.
Life is so important.
How could it be so fucking fragile?
You' d see it right away, wouldn' t you?
You trying to impress me?
Because you got the wrong guy.
Killing that girl made you feel special.
But you' re not.
You' re the same pathetic freak I' ve been dealing with for 30 years.
Know how many of you I caught with your pants down?
- I never touched her like that.
- You wanted to.
Now you wish you had.
Best you could do is clip her nails.
Now you' re so different.
You don' t get it, do you?
You' re my job.
You' re what I' m paid to do.
You' re about as mysterious to me as a toilet is to a plumber.
Reasons for doing what you did?
Who gives a fuck?
Motivations are everything, Will.
What did you see through the fog?
I saw pretty clearly, didn' t I?
I saw you take aim...
- Forget it. -... shoot your partner in the chest.
I heard him say, "Get away from me!" Why?
Anything to do with Internal Affairs investigation?
All that tension in your department?
- You think I' m that easy?
- I' m saying that' s how it looks.
Maybe even how it feels.
How did it feel when you found out it was Hap?
Relief?
Suddenly, you' re free and clear.
Did you think about it before that moment?
What would it be like if he wasn' t there anymore?
Doesn' t mean you did it on purpose.
You figure if you got something on me, then I' il just roll over?
- Protect my reputation?
- No.
Protect your life' s work.
The scumbags you put away will be back on the street before you go on trial.
With Hap gone, you' re free and clear.
Why mess with that?
Kay Connell.
Remember her?
It' s your choice.
Think of all the other Kay Connells.
Do the math.
You' re a pragmatist.
You have to be because of your job.
This isn' t easy, but I want you to understand...... we' re in the same situation here.
You didn' t mean to kill Hap any more than I meant to kill Kay.
But that' s hard for them to believe, so that' s why we need each other.
We gotta find a patsy for the Connell case and make it stick.
Then you go back to Los Angeles and I can go back to living my life.
So, what do you need from me?
What do they know about me?
They found a signed copy of one of your books at Kay' s house.
- So you' il be brought in for questioning.
- At the station?
That' s what they usually do.
Brought in for questioning.
I can write that easily.
Calm down.
It' s no big thing.
It' s preliminary inquiry, so...... just tell the truth.
- Tell them about Randy -- - Why are you talking about Randy?
Talk about your relationship with Kay.
You can' t hide it, so just say it.
Randy is none of your business.
It' s not your affair.
Shouldn' t I tell them she was unhappy --
Tell them she was unhappy, but let them find Randy themselves.
That way, they' il make it stick.
Understand?
We need a wild card.
- A wild card?
- Yeah.
Something that' s there.
Something we can use.
It' s in every good detective novel.
You still have the. 38?
No.
That' s a shame.
We could use that.
That' d be very convincing for them.
This is my stop.
Dormer!
Wild card!
- Night, everyone.
- Night, Francis.
Working some overtime?
- Nice.
- Cracking some big cases?
- Night.
- Night, guys.
This is always the worst time of night for me.
Too late for yesterday, too early for tomorrow.
Sorry about the tape.
I had to make sure you' d follow through.
I' il follow through.
I' ve been thinking it over.
I should tell them about Randy.
- I think that' s a bad idea.
- "But he' s the patsy.
He deserves it. "
You should have heard the shit Kay told me.
But these are cops.
They' re not children.
You don' t throw things like that in their lap.
I' il push them toward Randy.
When the time is right.
We don' t have the gun.
How will we convince them he' s guilty?
Did you keep the dress?
The dress?
Kay' s dress, nail clippings.
What did you do with those?
That' s great.
The dress.
We could use that.
Even better than the gun.
- Where could he have taken her?
- "Where' d you take her?"
- She died in the cabin, right?
- Yeah.
Where' d you take her to clean her up?
Don' t think about that.
This is tough enough for you.
- It was an accident.
- Yeah.
- I didn' t mean to kill her, you know.
- I know, but what happened?
She called and said that she and Randy had had a fight.
She wanted to come over and talk, and I said, "Meet me at our place."
That' s the cabin at the beach.
She comes over.
She' s distraught and a little drunk.
She starts telling me about how Randy and Tanya were carrying on.
I only wanted to comfort her.
Hold her.
I kissed her, and got a little excited...... and she started laughing at me.
She wouldn' t stop laughing.
Vulnerable.
Someone you thought respected you?
You ever have that happen?
I just wanted to stop her laughing.
And then, you know...... I hit her.
Couple of times, to stop her.
Get a little respect.
She liked it when he did it.
She never blamed him.
Never wanted to leave him.
I do it, she starts screaming.
She wouldn' t stop.
I put my hand over her mouth.
Then I' m really scared.
I' m scared shitless.
More scared than I' ve ever been.
I' m more scared than her.
And then...... everything was clear.
There was no turning back.
And after that, I was calm.
Real calm.
You and I share a secret.
We know how easy it is to kill somebody.
That ultimate taboo.
It doesn' t exist outside our minds.
I didn' t murder her.
I killed her, but it just ended up that way.
So where' d you take the body?
Thanks for listening to me.
Feels good to talk about that stuff.
I' il be able to sleep now.
You wanna talk about Hap?
- Morning.
- Your phone isn' t working.
I turned it off.
I needed to sleep.
Sorry.
Fred called that author.
He was happy to cooperate.
He' il be in first thing, so we need to get to the office.
I forgot to tell you they sell these in stores in Anchorage.
- No way of finding out who bought it.
- Okay.
Bet you' re looking forward to getting back to L. A.
Back to robbery homicide, or...... maybe not.
- What are you saying to me, Ellie?
- Nothing.
Are you doing okay?
You haven' t been sleeping much.
No.
A good cop can' t sleep because a piece of the puzzle' s missing.
A bad cop, because his conscience won' t let him.
- You said that once.
- I did?
Sounds like something I' d say, don' t it?
I' il see you back there.
In what regard were you and her familiar?
- How did you know her?
- She was an avid reader of my novels.
When did you meet her first?
A year ago.
She came to a signing in Nightmute.
She hung around afterwards.
We chatted about my writing...... and how she wanted to write...... then she asked if she could visit me and talk about books, things like that.
- And she did?
- Yeah, we became very close.
She got comfortable enough to show me her writing.
- What does she write?
- Poetry, actually.
- Any good?
- No, not really.
- You tell her that?
- Why would I?
Exactly what was the nature of your relationship to this girl, Finch?
I was someone she could talk to.
Someone outside of her everyday life.
That' s why she needed me and approached me.
Why' d she need you for that?
- Well, her boyfriend, Randy -- - Randy Stetz?
He hit her.
- We know all this already.
- It was getting worse.
- So?
A lot worse.
Really.
Why all this eagerness to talk about Randy?
You' re right.
I' m sorry.
That' s probably all hearsay.
I don' t want anything I say taken the wrong way.
Anything you say to us at this stage is in confidence.
Secondly, we' re not a bunch of hotheads who' il draw crazy conclusions.
- Okay.
- Please, continue.
One more thing.
Probably doesn' t mean much, but I think Kay was scared.
- I have myself to blame for that.
- Why is that?
Randy knew who I was.
He knew that she had a friend...... someone she confided in.
It made him furious.
She wrote about being scared.
Her letters were getting desperate.
You still have these letters, by any chance?
I probably do.
Do you think it might help?
They might.
Okay.
Anything else?
The thing that worried her the most was the gun.
He had this old handgun.
He showed it to her.
I don' t know where he got it, probably wasn' t even his...... but he said he' d use it if he found out who she was seeing.
He kept it hidden in a heating vent.
You know, in the skirting boards?
It might be the. 38.
- What?
I' m getting a search warrant to Randy' s.
- Get Judge Biggs on the phone.
- I should get over there.
- No!
- No?
You' re the guy he' s talking to.
Okay?
Do you know when Randy showed her the gun?
February?
No, probably January.
Why didn' t you come forward when she died?
- She didn' t want anybody to know.
- Even when she was dead?
Beaten to death.
Her body dumped on a pile of garbage!
- I was her friend.
- No!
- Acquaintance.
We were close -- - Close?
She was attractive.
Did you have sex with her?
- She was 17.
- Seventeen?
She was attractive.
I suppose.
Suppose?
She was.
So did you have sex with her?
- No, I was her mentor.
Gifts.
- Yes.
- What kind of gifts?
- Books, mostly, that' s what she loved.
What about this?
- You give her this?
- Yes.
Why?
- To see how she looked with it on?
- No.
- No?
Why jewelry?
- It was just a present.
- Bought a lot of presents?
Dresses?
- What' s wrong with that?
Nothing.
I' m figuring out what kind of mentor you were.
I gave her things she couldn' t have.
You wanted to fuck her, didn' t you?
Sick son of a bitch!
- Cool off.
- Sick bastard.
Okay?
Cool down.
All right.
I need a break.
I have to apologize on behalf of my colleague.
He' s been under a lot of pressure lately.
But he' s a good cop.
I' d hate to see the bad cop.
Search and seizure warrant.
Yes, sir.
Randy Stetz.
- We got our warrant!
We appreciate it.
Francis, come with me.
Let' s go!
- You' re not going?
- No.
Are you not on the Connell case?
I' m covering the shooting of Detective Dormer' s partner.
Heard about that.
- Should I call about Kay' s letters?
I' il pick them up.
Stetz!
We' re coming in!
Turn the place over.
Look there!
Try over there!
Rich, look here now.
I got it!
Hey, Fred!
- Just in time, Dormer.
- Had it in the motor oil.
What the fuck is this?
He says he was with Tanya when Kay was killed.
- That' s what she told me.
- When?
- When I questioned her.
- Were you planning on telling us?
That' s what I' m doing now.
Randy and Tanya were screwing around.
She' s trying to protect him.
- And the gun?
- Says it isn' t his.
If we get the ballistics match, he' il be forthcoming.
- Leaving?
- First thing tomorrow.
If Spencer can remember where he parked the plane.
I thought you wanted to kill me in the interview room.
- Randy is in jail.
- Said I' d write an ending they' d like.
You were wrapped up in details.
- The details?
He' s innocent.
- No, he isn' t.
He beat Kay.
One day he' d do something worse.
You knew I planted the gun?
You wanted to help me before the tape recorder.
You had to have a wild card.
You' re a good man.
I know that, even if you' ve forgotten it.
When were you gonna point them at me?
When you found Kay' s dress?
Where I took the body?
If you have a gun and forensics...... wouldn' t matter what I said about you killing your partner.
May I have the tape?
- Did you make any other copies?
- Why would I?
Stop me from turning you in.
Or killing you.
I don' t have a hold over you.
You made choices.
Like I wasn' t here.
It won' t help Randy.
After your scene at the department, it won' t do you good if I' m dead.
- A lot of ways a man can die.
- Like an accident?
Like Hap.
Like Kay.
It took you 10 minutes to beat Kay Connell to death.
Ten fucking minutes.
You calling that an accident?
It took you a fraction of a second to kill your partner.
Is that more of an accident?
Is this an accident?
If you want it to be.
It' s over, Walt.
It' s over.
I' m telling them everything.
Tell them about Hap, you, everything.
- What good would that do?
- It' il end this thing.
It won' t end it.
You' re not thinking straight.
Will you tell the truth?
You shot your partner and lied about it.
To them, you' re a liar and a killer.
You' re tainted.
Forever!
You don' t get to pick when you tell the truth.
The truth is beyond that.
That tape was the only proof we had a conversation outside of that room.
To them, I' m a writer that Kay admired.
Randy is the killer, and you' re a hero cop.
Your life' s work is intact.
Another abusive scumbag is in jail.
Everything is as it should be.
Go back to Los Angeles.
The case against Randy is pretty solid.
I can take care of everything here.
I got it worked out.
Go home.
Midnight of your sixth night.
You broke my record, Will.
He was an asshole.
- You knew him as a kid?
- Dads were on the same boat.
- Bad seed.
How do you like our beer?
What Dormer needs is a little shuteye.
- White nights getting to you?
- Hasn' t been easy.
- Better than winter.
- Got that right.
- Sun barely comes up for five months.
- Like being sucked into a black hole.
- Hey, Nancy Drew.
You hear?
- Rich found the gun.
- Something' s on her mind.
- I found this on the beach.
- What is it?
- Shell casing, 9mm.
The murder weapon was a. 38.
None of us carries a 9mm.
Or backup weapon, right?
Get a hobby, would you?
It' s a legitimate point, isn' t it, detective?
This case is closed, Ellie.
Hold the fort, boys.
I' il go find a men' s room.
Relieve myself of your fine Alaskan beer.
Do you want a beer or something?
No, thanks.
- He' s good people, right?
- Don' t get carried away.
What has two thumbs and loves blowjobs?
- I don' t know.
- This guy.
It' s been something, Dormer.
It' s been really great working with you.
- Run Will to the airport?
- I gotta pick up the letters.
In Umkumiut --
At his lake house.
Dormer will have to leave my car at the dock.
- If that' s okay with you?
- Yeah, it' s fine.
It' s been a pleasure.
Get some sleep.
Detective Dormer.
What is it?
Someone' s complaining about the noise.
Says he can' t sleep.
Something wrong?
It' s so fucking bright in here.
No, it' s dark in here.
Will you please...?
There' s this guy, Wayne Dobbs, 24.
Works part time at a copy store.
Every day he watches this 8- year- old boy...... waiting for his carpool across the street.
- This is one of your cases?
Hap and me.
A year and a half ago.
For six months, he watches this kid.
Finally gets up the nerve.
He goes down, grabs that boy before the carpool comes...... takes him back to his apartment...... and keeps him there for three days.
He tortures him...
... and makes him do things.
He gets a rope.
He hangs the boy in a storage space in the basement of the building.
But he didn' t do it right.
Little boy' s neck didn' t break, so he dangled there for a while...... and then died finally from the shock.
Landlord found the body five days later.
The second I met this guy, Dobbs, I knew he was guilty.
That' s what I do.
I assign guilt.
You find the evidence...... figure out who did it, and then you go get them and put them away.
This time there wasn' t enough evidence.
And it' s reasonable doubt to a jury...... because a jury never met a child murderer before.
But I have.
Anyway....
I went and took some blood samples from the boy' s dead body...... and I planted them...
... in Dobbs' apartment.
I could feel it there.
This is gonna catch up with me.
- I don' t do things like that.
- So how did it catch up with you?
Internal Affairs is coming down on our department.
Hap, he was gonna cut a deal...... and bring me straight into it.
They would' ve reopened Dobbs' case, he would' ve walked.
Now that won' t happen.
And I don' t know...... how I feel about that.
But Dobbs was guilty.
Dobbs needed to be convicted.
So the end justifies the means.
Right?
- I' m in no position to judge.
- Why not?
Two kinds of people live in Alaska.
The ones who are born here, and the ones who come here to escape something.
I wasn' t born here.
Why don' t you tell me what you think?
Here.
Now.
You and me.
Please.
I guess it' s about what you thought was right at the time.
Then, what you' re willing to live with.
- "Nightmute Police Department."
- Detective Burr.
She' s not here.
She left town "about 20 minutes ago to go pick up" --
- Mr. Finch.
- Detective Burr.
- Are they friendly?
- Yeah.
Didn' t expect to see you this soon.
Sorry about the mess, doing some work.
Could Kay' s letters strengthen the case against Randy?
Possibly.
Watch your head.
I' ve done it 1000 times.
Sorry about all the clutter.
I am a pack- rat.
I keep everything.
Just don' t know where.
- They' ve gotta be here somewhere.
- Working on a new book?
- Have you read any of my books?
- I haven' t.
- She knows, Will.
- Where is she?
She knows you killed Hap.
You would' ve realized if you weren' t strung out.
- The way she looks at you -- - Where is she?
- It' s under control.
- If anything happened to her --
She' s okay.
If she talks, you' re fucked.
Everything you' ve worked for is destroyed.
- Now give me -- - Show me where she is.
She' s okay.
Listen.
I mean, it' s all fine.
Let' s search this place.
For the dress.
- What dress?
- Ellie' s....
- Kay' s!
- You' re rambling.
Ellie' s here.
- I' m taking care of us.
- She saw the dress.
Where' d you get us?
Don' t talk about us.
She' s alive, Will.
Ellie!
Hold it!
Don' t move!
You shot Detective Eckhart.
And Finch saw you do it.
Did you mean to shoot Hap?
I don' t know anymore.
I don' t know.
I couldn' t see him through the fog, but when I got up close...... he was afraid of me...... and he thought I meant to do it, so maybe I did.
I just don' t know anymore.
- Where' s your gun?
- He took it.
Keep your head down.
I got seven rounds in this clip.
Head down.
Okay, go!
You forgot the wild card.
Detective Dormer!
I called for backup.
They' il be here soon.
Dormer, just hold on.
Hold on.
Nobody needs to know.
You didn' t mean to do it.
I know that even if you don' t.
No, don' t.
Don' t.
What?
Why?
Don' t lose your way.
Hang on.
Dormer.
Let me sleep.
No.
Just let me sleep.
You see that ass?
- Mm- hmm.
Man.
One of the guys at school... this, uh, biology teacher, Terry...
- Did you ever meet Terry?
No, I don' t think so.
Anyway, he, uh, he... he really likes this girl.
- Like a student?
- Yeah.
- Oh, man.
I mean, the girl' s 16, 17, maybe.
I don' t know.
She' s... she' s got something.
- Mm- hmm.
I told Terry, you know, to just forget about it, you know?
He' s kind of obsessing, and it' s kind of scary the way he talks about it.
But he' s like...
"Five years from now,
"she' il almost be out of college.
"I mean, I' il be 36.
"You know, and... you know?
Nothing wrong with that, you know? "
No, I' m sorry.
Were you listening to what I just said?
No, I haven' t fucked her.
Of course...
That' s good, because, man, big mistake.
I mean, I' m not a pervert.
You know what a man should never ask in a Victoria' s Secret?
What?
"Does this come in children' s sizes?"
Think about that.
- What' s that supposed to mean?
- It' s literal.
- It' s a joke.
- It' s literal?
Why do we always have to do this?
Why can' t we just sit down and just shut the fuck up, have a beer, have a drink?
What' s the matter with you?
Francis Xavier Slaughtery.
Hey, baby.
- How are you, Naturelle?
- Hey.
- Nice to see you.
- You too.
- Hi.
- How you doing, Jake?
Nat.
- There you go.
Thank you.
What are you boys up to?
Frank' s just flirting with the bartender.
Oh, yeah?
What' s the verdict?
Guilty of looking good.
Oh, she' s just tits, Francis.
Oh, yeah?
Did you see her ass?
The girl' s got a fine ass.
She' s oozing sex appeal.
Oh, she' s oozing something.
See, that right there... that is so typical.
That' s what I' m talking about, Jake.
Why is it that a woman walks in the room with great tits, every other woman in the joint says that she' s a slut?
I' m not a slut.
Says you.
Another thing...
Hey!
When I call a girl and I say, "Hey, we' re gonna meet for a dinner at this particular place," why can' t I get off the phone for a half an hour?
You guys have a sickness.
Please explain this to me.
Why is it that women feel the need to cry after having great sex?
- Hmm?
- Oh.
Why is that?
What is up with that, all right?
- What?
- Are you serious?
Yes.
Well, it' s a joy thing, it' s not...
Oh, please.
You' re just a sad fuck, Francis.
Looks like you' ve been, uh, demoted from the 99th percentile right there.
Thanks, Jake.
You should' ve been here earlier.
Okay.
So, where' s your man?
Not like he' s ever on time.
Better be tomorrow.
How' s his dad doing?
He looks like he' s aged 20 years in the past couple months.
That' s too bad.
We got to keep this upbeat, make sure he has a good night tonight.
All right.
Why don' t you give us some more sex tips?
That' il cheer things up.
- Touche.
Where' s the little girls' room?
Thank you.
I know she cries after having sex with him.
I' d bet good money on that shit.
You' d like to know, wouldn' t you?
Set 'em up for the dead- end kids.
You been waiting long?
We got here early.
Naturelle?
Hey.
Thank you, Jody.
- Thank you.
Yeah.
Thanks, Jody.
I was just saying.
- Thank you.
- Hey.
- Fuck Sunday.
Whole city came out to say goodbye.
You got a lot of young fans.
Yeah.
I think we' re the oldest people here.
"We"?
This is my guy.
How you doing, big man?
Mr. Man... the man' s arrived!
Coming and going at the same time.
Seven years, man... that shit ain' t no joke.
Man, that' s nervous, man.
That' s the word.
Damn, you all right?
I' m trying not to think about it, you know?
What... what is this?
What... what' s going on here?
That' s the legendary DJ Dusk, man.
That' s my man from Fort Greene.
He' s nice.
17 years old, man.
- 17?
- Motherfucker' s 17!
But he gets the girls jumping, man.
And don' t worry about the crowd.
- V. I. P. 's set up for y' all.
- These are my people here.
Do you want us to come in here?
No, you' re going through the back, and the door' il be open.
- Don' t worry about that.
- Thank you.
Hey, listen up, don' t lose your temper until it' s time to lose your temper, you hear me?
Take care of yourself.
I' il catch you on the other side.
I' il see you when I see you.
Hey, Elinsky!
Mr. Elinsky!
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?
I- I didn' t know that you ever left the school.
Um...
Mary D' Annunzio.
Mary "B- minus" D' Annunzio, that' s me.
I- I' m kidding.
It' s not a big deal.
No, it' s okay.
I' m here with friends, so I have to go.
That guy who came to class today?
He knows people, right?
I mean, so, do you think he could get us in?
I don' t think...
You know, they' re not letting anyone in right now.
I mean, I have to.
You' re a fan of Dusk?
Yeah, s- sure.
He' s the absolute truth, right?
I mean, he is so truth.
I can' t believe that you' re into Dusk.
No offense, but I thought you' d be more into show tunes or Barry Manilow or something.
No, I think...
I think Dusk is very good.
I mean, I prefer his earlier work.
- Hey, Jake!
- His earlier work?
What are you doing?
I' m...
Come on.
- We' re together.
You' re the guy with the dog, right?
You again.
Isn' t it past your bedtime?
Oh, no.
I' m with Jake.
We' re... we' re lovers.
- Lovers?
Really?
- She' s kidding.
Well, come on in.
There' s plenty of room for lovers.
Can... can they come, too?
- Girls?
- Mary, please.
Are you outta your mind?
We can' t take a bunch of guys in.
Let' s go, let' s go.
She can' t go in there.
No, it' s good, it' s good.
- Monty...
- What' s up?
These two.
Yeah, all right.
Truth.
You know, I' ve seen pictures of this room.
Like, Daft Punk was in here.
So, um, who are you?
Are you someone famous?
Hey, D' Annunzio, what do you say we give it a rest with the questions?
Have a little champagne.
Okay.
Who' s that?
One of Jake' s students.
What?
Enjoy.
Champagne for my real friends... and real pain for my sham friends.
Did you like that?
Yep.
Does anyone want to go dance?
Come on, dance with me.
Go ahead.
No, go do it.
I' il catch up with you.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Hey, Daphne, you got any whiskey?
What kind do you want?
McCallen '18.
I' il go see if we have some upstairs.
I' il come with you.
Back in a flash.
I can' t believe you brought my student in here.
Oh, come on.
She' s cute, she is.
She talks a little bit too much, but she' s... she' s cute.
You' re gonna get me fired.
You realize that?
- and they just keep talking.
- What are they gonna say?
They' re gonna say you met her at a club, you ran into her, you talked a little bit.
Seriously, I mean, you haven' t done anything wrong yet.
What do you mean "yet"?
She' s all over you.
She' d hop on you in a second.
She' s 17, all right?
She' s my student.
I can' t, you know, just touch her...
Not now, but in, like, seven months, she' il be grad...
She' il be the age Naturelle was when I met her.
- Like I said, not yet.
- Okay!
Look, Jake, Jake, I' m kidding.
- Well, you know...
- I' m giving you a hard time.
You' re way too smart for that shit.
Really, you' ve always been smart about that stuff.
I- I really do, I do.
Here, another sip.
Yeah, I' m pissed.
Hey, listen, make me a toast.
You want me to make you a toast?
Yeah, come on.
I' m not gonna see you for a long time.
Say something nice.
Okay.
Um...
Jesus.
Jake, relax.
Don' t... here, um, here' s to Doyle.
- To Doyle.
- All right.
Your dog now.
- No.
- Yeah.
- He loves you.
- Yeah?
He loves you, and he needs a home 'cause I' m going away.
I don' t know.
I mean, you' ve seen the size of my apartment, right?
So what?
Doyle' s a tough dog.
He' s seen worse, you know.
He' il learn to live in a small space.
He' il survive.
Yeah, but what about Nat?
No, no, she' s... she' s moving in with her mother.
The woman fucking hates him, and Doyle detests Frank, and my father' s allergic, so...
Saving him... saving him...
'cause every day that he' s had since then, that' s because of me.
- You know what?
- Will you take him home?
Will you give him a home while I' m gone?
I' d be honored.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
This joint is jumping, boy.
There' s a smorgasbord of girlies here tonight.
And you' re the talent scout, huh?
You bet.
How you guys doing?
- Good.
My student.
Hot student.
What?
No!
Not the student?
"Terry' s friend"... the student?
Remind me never to tell you anything.
Leave him alone.
This is the only honest man in the room.
- He' s doing noble work.
- All right.
Party begins without me?!
Yeah, it started without you, you fat Russian fuck.
Fat Ukrainian fuck.
Yeah, is there... there' s a difference?
Monty, my friend, you here long?
Not long.
You open shampanskoe without me.
Hey, the clock' s ticking, Kostya.
I don' t have all the time in the world.
- Hello, Frank.
- How you doing, Kostadin?
Kostya, please...
Kostya.
- How you doing, brother?
I am better when our friend comes back to us, no?
Jason, yes?
Jacob.
My shampanskoe, you like?
It' s okay.
Monty, I have beautiful woman, very nice.
I' ve got a nice girl.
Tonight is special night.
Last night as free man.
I pick her out special just for you.
The last girl you picked out special for me had three teeth, all in the back.
Funny you should say that.
Why is it funny I should say that?
What you say, it was funny.
Kostya, you can' t... when you...
It' s an expression.
If you say that...
It' s a, uh, euphemism, right?
Can you explain this?
You' re the English teacher.
Uh...
Exactly.
No, no.
It was funny what you say...
"Funny you should say that."
This is what I deal with.
Perfectly clear.
- You see her.
- I don' t think so.
Naturelle, she' s dancing right out here.
You must see this bitch.
Why don' t you just find some nice girls for my friends here?
- Frank?
- Nah, I' m good, good.
I' m fine.
Let' s just go down.
- Come with me.
- I' m good.
Forget that.
I gotta talk to you for, like, five minutes.
All right.
You want me to stay here?
Yeah, someone' s gotta look out for Naturelle and, you know, your... your field trip.
Should I tell Nat that you' re having sex with prostitutes?
No, don' t say this.
Just don' t go away, all right?
We' il go Uptown and get Doyle.
So, what time you wanna hook up?
I get off at 4: 00.
Are we going in the private room?
Of course, the private room.
I' m sorry, Monty.
I gotta talk to Frank for five minutes.
I' il meet you down there.
After girl, Uncle Nikolai wants talk with you.
I know, I know, Kostya.
Give me five minutes.
Remember, they' re waiting.
I know they' re waiting!
Give me five fucking minutes!
Okay.
She looks good in silver, huh?
Yeah.
You know, Naturelle...
I' ve told you this, right?
She' s the only girl I' ve ever kept fantasizing about after I slept with her.
Is that normal?
That' s a pretty good kind of normal.
Hey, fellas.
- That' s right.
Stay cool, brother.
How you doing, brother?
You all right?
Six months, you know.
I was gonna come to you with the loot... put me in some stocks, put me in some mutuals.
Don' t do this.
I' m gonna kick back, watch my coin multiply.
We' re gonna get rich together.
You know, Monty, you shouldn' t talk like this.
I can take out a little more to live on, a little more. "
I got greedy, greedy.
I just fucked myself.
Man, you' re gonna wrap yourself around in a twist, you keep thinking about this shit.
That' s all I can do is think about it.
- I' m not gonna make it, Frank.
- Yes, you will.
There' s a thousand guys up there who are harder than me.
I mean, in a room, some junkie doesn' t want to pay me, and Kostya behind me, I' m pretty scary.
Up there, I' m a skinny white boy with no friends.
Those guys are gonna use me up and end me.
No, they won' t, man.
You know why?
Because you' re smarter than all of them.
You' re gonna get up there, you' re gonna keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.
You' re gonna know the names, the whole scenario.
You' re gonna have the place wired in a week.
They got bunk beds lined up in the gymnasium to handle the overflow.
I' m going in a room with 200 other guys, Frank.
So picture this... first night, lights out.
"You are miles from home."
I got some big guy' s knee in my back.
I can give it a little go, but there will be too many of them.
Someone takes a pipe out from under a mattress, starts beating me in the face... not to hurt me, just to knock all my teeth out so I can give him head all night, and they don' t have to worry about me biting.
Let' s say I make it through 7 years minus 84 days for good behavior.
W- What then?
What kind of skills do I have?
I can' t go back to doing this.
It' s 15 years to life for a second pinch.
I' m gonna be a 38- year- old punked- out ex- con with government- issue dentures.
38 is still young.
You' re gonna get out, and you and me, we' re gonna start something up... you know, a fucking bar.
We' re two Irish kids from Brooklyn.
Where the fuck would we be without a bar, right?
How can we not have a bar?
Come on, we have free hot dogs on "Monday Night Football," you know?
We got an old jukebox in the corner.
Green beer on St. Patty' s day.
Fuck green beer, Frank.
You' ve been working 15 years to get away from green beer.
I' m just saying we got options.
I don' t see it, man.
I don' t see you working with me.
We' ve known each other since we were 3.
Have I ever broken a promise to you, huh?
Have I ever once broken a promise to you?
Have I ever said I' m gonna be somewhere and not shown up?
No.
I' m gonna be there when you get out, you hear me?
I' m gonna fucking be there.
I know you will, I know you will, but you' re not gonna be there tomorrow, and it' s all about tomorrow.
Listen, I got one idea, one way I might buy myself a little room to breathe, but I need a big favor from you.
Cool.
Jake the snake.
Jake the snake.
What are you doing?
Don' t panic.
Nobody here gives a shit.
I give a shit.
I give a shit!
You know what happens if someone sees me?
Beg your pardon, Mr. Elinsky.
Are you drunk?
Yeah.
And I had some "E" earlier.
I didn' t need to know that.
You know, Naturelle is cool as shit.
She knows everyone who works here, and I love that name, right?
You know, 100% "Naturelle."
All "Naturelle" flavors.
And what' s up with her boyfriend, Monty?
It' s like he owns this place.
Mary...
Mary...
Do you think it would be possible to avoid talking about this at school...
I mean, t- this whole night?
Do you think it would be possible for you to give me an "A" for this semester?
Tell me you' re joking.
Tell me you' re joking.
I' m joking.
That' s what I love about you, Elinsky.
What?
What?
Huh?
What' s what you love about me?
Never mind.
Hey, do you think I' m weird?
No, I don' t think you' re weird.
Are you allowed to stay out this late... you know, on a school night?
Do you think my mother gives a shit?
She' s probably at her boyfriend' s, anyway.
I need to sleep.
Can' t sleep yet.
Dusk is turning it on.
Hey... is there a bathroom in here?
Is there?
Yeah?
Where is it?
It' s, um... right up the stairs.
Back there.
- No.
Hey.
Hey.
- Mm- hmm.
Keep an eye on Monty tonight, would you?
Try to stick with him.
What' s the matter?
He' s just acting... really strange.
He' s going to prison in a couple hours.
How do you want him to act?
I want him to act like he' s scared.
Well, he is scared, Naturelle.
Believe me, he' s scared.
I just don' t want him to hurt himself.
So will you watch him for me?
I don' t think he wants me here.
Why wouldn' t he want you here?
You see the way he looks at me lately?
It' s like he doesn' t trust me.
What reason does he have not to trust you?
I' m gonna go up top, Francis.
So when you see him, just...
Cool.
I got it.
Are you all right?
How could he do this, huh?
Just throw it all away?
I' m his oldest friend.
What' d I do to stop it?
What' d I say to him?
Nothing.
Not a word.
I didn' t say shit.
Everybody' s talking about buying from Monty, you know, the whole school, and I knew they were gonna nail him, I knew it.
I didn' t say a word.
Fucking last 10 years, I' ve been watching him get deeper and deeper in with these friends of his, these fucks who you wouldn' t want petting Doyle.
And did I say, "Hey, careful, Monty, you better cool out, man"?
I didn' t say shit.
I just sat there and watched him ruin his life.
And you did, too, all right?
We both did.
- We all did.
- Monty never listens.
You know how stubborn he is, okay?
I told Monty he should quit a hundred times.
Did you?
Was that before or after you moved into his apartment?
Of all nights, please not tonight.
Just don' t start.
Who paid for the apartment?
I need a drink.
Was that before or after he gave you that platinum necklace?
Do you want to watch your mouth?
Who paid for the Cartier diamond earrings... this silver dress you' re wearing?
Paid in full by the addictions of other people.
- That' s what I' m saying.
You two fly down to San Juan, first class all the way.
What do you think paid for Puerto Rico?
listen to me.
You' ve never been to P. R. In your life before Monty.
You told him to quit?
The hell you did, Naturelle.
Back up.
You knew the deal the minute you met him.
You never had a real job in your whole life.
And you never said a goddamn word.
Who are you to get all righteous with me?
Did you disown him?
You' re his best friend, and you never said a thing.
But this is my fault?
I' m the evil one?
Never once, not a red...
How long have you been saving this, huh?
One minute ago, you were my friend.
Are you drunk?
Tell me you' ve been drinking too much.
You' re fucking drunk.
I' m Irish.
I can' t get drunk, all right?
I know exactly what I' m saying.
Seven years from now, I' il be at the prison gate.
You' il be married to Monty.
Right or wrong?
- Right or wrong?
- What is wrong with you?
You want me to be the bad guy?
Fine, I' m the bad guy.
Are you happy now?
God, Francis.
All I' m saying... is you knew where he hid the money.
You knew where he hid the drugs, didn' t you?
What the hell are you saying?
What the hell are you saying right now, Francis?
You know exactly what I' m saying.
I told Monty when he first met you, but he wouldn' t listen to me.
Nat.
BARTENDER:
Is she all right?
Can we get out of here?
We gotta wait for Monty.
I kissed her.
You what?
I kissed her.
Who you trying to be...
R. Kelly?
I kissed my 17- year- old high school student.
Shut the fuck up.
Excuse me.
Could I... could I have a water?
Hit him.
- Hit him.
- Okay.
I don' t want to drink anymore, Frank.
Give him the whiskey.
Drink it.
Montgomery, how' s the party?
Nice.
Thanks for setting it up.
I was 14 years old.
Skinny little boy... very afraid.
By the time I came out, I had a beard.
I was grown man.
I went back to my hometown.
I found my mother.
I kissed her.
And she screamed.
She didn' t recognize me.
I have been in three different prisons, Montgomery.
Three different countries.
And you know what I learned?
I learned prison is a bad place to be.
Seven years is a long time.
Some men would do anything to avoid seven years in prison.
Your father is a hardworking man.
Where' s his bar?
Staten Island?
2192 Bay Street?
He drives in from Bay Ridge... a 1986 Jeep Grand Wagoneer.
Should I tell you how many miles he has on the car?
I like your father... a hardworking man.
He' s had bad luck.
Everyone in the neighborhood loved your mother.
Da?
Yeah.
Everyone said she was a beautiful woman.
I want to help your father.
I could use a man like that, a hardworking man, a man I could trust.
I could take care of your father.
Do you understand what I mean, Montgomery?
You don' t have to do this.
I never said anything to anybody, okay?
Leave my father out of it.
I asked you a question, Montgomery.
I understand exactly what you mean.
I have a good job for your father.
We' il help him with the money he owes.
No, thank you.
Good weapon.
Accurate.
No jams.
Have you ever fired a gun?
At someone, I mean.
No.
It' s a toy for you.
Not toy, a prop.
A prop for you, like an actor.
Am I wrong?
With the gun, you feel more... dangerous.
It' s not mine.
I didn' t say anything.
I never said anything, Nikolai.
I swear to God.
I know that.
You know that.
They tried.
I never said anything.
I believe you, Montgomery.
This is my advice to you... when you get there, figure it out who' s who.
Find the man nobody' s protecting... a man without friends... and beat him until his eyes bleed.
Let them think you are a little bit crazy, but respectful, too.
Respectful of the right men.
It won' t be easy for you.
But remember, I was 14 when I first went.
I tattooed "survive" on my hand the night before I went away to prison.
And I did.
We do what we have to do to survive.
Monty, please!
Monty!
Now we have this other problem.
How many people knew you kept the stuff inside the sofa, huh?
Your girlfriend and Kostya.
Nobody else.
- Ugh!
Kostya ratted you out, little brother.
He made the call and stole seven years from your life.
They put the clamps on him.
And instead of being a man about it, he sold you out!
It' s not true.
You know how to use it?
Yeah, I know how to use it.
This man does not deserve to live.
He betrayed you.
He betrayed me.
He stole from you.
He stole seven years from you.
Please.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
No, don' t do this!
- Shut up!
- No!
Don' t talk!
- You motherfucker.
- They' re lying.
Why' d you do it?!
Why did you do it?!
You let me think it was her?!
Why' d you tell me it was her?!
- Don' t do this.
- Why' d you tell me it was her?!
Kill this cockroach!
Why?!
No, no, no, no, Monty!
- Why?!
Why?!
- Please!
Why did you tell me it was her?!
- Do it!
- I had no choice!
I had no choice, Monty!
- Why?!
- Please.
Why?!
I had no choice.
I had no choice.
You told me to trust this man, I trusted this man.
Now I' m gone seven.
Clean up your own fucking mess.
Be careful.
You do whatever you want with him.
When I walk out this door, I' m done.
I' m out and my father' s out.
You are being foolish.
You gonna let me go or not?
Remember what I told you.
A man... with no friends.
No, Monty, please.
Please.
You were my friend.
Please, Monty, I' m sorry.
Don' t leave me.
You are missing your party.
No!
You know what time it is?
Eh?
Do you know what time it is?
Late at night.
No, it' s early.
You up for a little more still?
Yeah.
Definitely.
Hey, there' s Jake.
Remember Jake?
Go see Jake.
Hey, what time is it?
I still got a couple of hours.
I' ve been putting you through, Naturelle.
I' ve been... thinking that you...
It doesn' t matter.
It matters to me.
I don' t want you to hate me when I' m gone.
I could never hate you, Montgomery.
I love you.
Hey, stay with me.
I got one last thing I gotta do.
- Don' t go.
- I' il be back.
Wouldn' t that be the life, huh?
Yeah.
Working a tugboat, be out on the river every morning.
Yeah.
It' d be nice.
What time you got?
Quarter past 6: 00.
All right.
All right.
Ready for Mr. Doyle?
Yeah.
The leash is yours.
I need you to make me ugly.
I can' t go in there looking like this.
It' s all about the first day.
I' il be finished.
You just said you' d do anything.
This is what I need.
What are you thinking?
I' m gonna give you a black eye, and nobody' s gonna mess with you?
I need a lot more than a black eye, pal.
Would you fucking help me out here?
- I can' t do it.
- I think you can.
- I' m not gonna hit you, Monty.
I think you want to a little bit.
What?
You think I deserve it a little.
I think you have for years.
like you want to smack some sense into me.
This is your chance.
I need it, Frank.
This is your favor...
"Make me ugly"?!
Where the hell is this coming from, man?!
It' s bullshit!
Don' t pussy out on me, Frank.
I need this from you.
Now, I' m not gonna fight back.
I' m not gonna be...
I' m not gonna kick you...
What the fuck do you want from me, man?!
- This is insane!
- Shut up!
Nobody' s talking to you!
Stay out of it!
All right, enough!
This is bullshit!
I' m gonna go get some breakfast.
I' m gonna forget this shit.
No breakfast.
Don' t do this, Monty.
What is all this bullshit you' ve been feeding me?
"I' m gonna be there for you, Monty"?
"I' il be there when you walk out."
He doesn' t know what he' s doing.
I think this whole situation' s convenient for you.
What do you mean "convenient"?
You' re gonna send me away, say, "Bye, Monty," so you can take care of Naturelle for me.
I would never fucking cross the line with her, man!
- Oh, bullshit!
- You' re full of shit!
Frank, he doesn' t mean it.
You think I don' t see the way you look at her, at her titties, at her ass?
You' ve been wanting to fuck her for years.
Don' t fucking do this, man!
Hey!
Hey!
Stop it!
Don' t do this!
Don' t do this!
Do it!
- No!
- Do it!
- No!
- Do it!
Do it!
No!
Do it!
Do it!
No!
- Stop!
Frank, stop!
You' re gonna kill him!
Frank.
Stop!
Frank...
Frank...
I' m sorry!
Come on.
Stop.
Oh, my God.
Monty!
Oh, my God!
It' s all right.
Just get me inside.
Get me inside.
Of course I will.
Oh, my God, baby.
Oh, God, Monty, let me take you to the hospital.
Why' d you stay with me all this time?
You should have left a long time ago.
Stop talking like that.
I' il wait for you.
As long as it takes.
Don' t cry, baby.
I' m such an idiot.
Naturelle, I blew it.
I really blew it.
Who' s that?
Who did this to you?
I gotta go.
Let him take you to the hospital, baby.
It' s okay.
How did this happen?
He just showed up like this.
He' s a mess.
These people are hooligans.
I' il take him to the hospital.
Say goodbye here, Pop.
You don' t trust my driving?
I can' t do it this way.
You just gotta let me walk away, Pop.
It' s easier.
Yeah.
Easier?
My God, you don' t understand.
Let me drive you there.
I need to know where it is for visits, you know?
O- Okay, buddy?
Help me out?
Okay.
Give me the bag.
No hospital, Pop.
No hospital.
Let' s go.
I gotta go.
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no.
I don' t want you coming up there to visit me.
I want you to be happy, so I want you to forget about me and live your life.
I figure we take the Henry Hudson to the Sprainbrook Parkway, then to the Taconic.
That should get us there.
Easy drive to Otisville.
Aw, Jesus, look what they did to you.
I tell you what, Monty, it' s gonna be okay.
Yeah.
Them hooligans sure give you a licking, though, huh?
How many were there?
I don' t know, Pop.
There was a bunch of 'em.
You get some good shots in?
Yeah, I got some good shots in.
Ah, give it a month.
You' il be better- looking than ever.
Hey, Pop...
You were right.
It wasn' t her.
It wasn' t Naturelle.
Of course it wasn' t Naturelle.
Cool dog.
Cool dog.
Give me the word, and I' il take a left turn.
Left turn to where?
Take the GW Bridge and go west.
Get you stitched up somewhere and keep going.
Find a nice little town.
On the way, stop in Chicago for a Cubs game.
You always told me you wanted to see Wrigley Field.
Dad...
I' m saying that if you want it... if that' s what you want, I' il do it.
No, they' d take your bar.
My bar.
My bar.
They can take my bar to hell and back.
You think my bar is more important to me than you, my only child?
Give me the word, and we' il go.
They' il find me.
They' il find me sooner or later.
You know how they find people?
They find them when they come home.
People run away, but they usually come back.
That' s when they get caught.
So you go... and you never come back.
You never come home.
We' il drive.
We' il keep driving.
Head out to the middle of nowhere.
Take that road as far as it takes us.
You' ve never been west of Philly, have you?
This is a beautiful country, Monty.
It' s beautiful out there.
Looks like a different world... mountains, hills, cows, farms, and white churches.
I drove out west with your mother one time before you was born.
Brooklyn to the Pacific in three days.
Just enough money for gas, sandwiches, and coffee, but we made it.
Every man, woman, and child alive should see the desert one time before they die.
Nothing at all for miles around, nothing but sand and rocks and cactus and blue sky.
Not a soul in sight.
No sirens, no car alarms, nobody honking at you, no madman cursing or pissing on the streets.
You find the silence out there.
You find the peace.
You can find God.
So, we drive west.
Keep driving till we find a nice little town.
These towns out in the desert... you know why they got there?
People wanted to get away from somewhere else.
The desert' s for starting over.
Find a bar, and I' il buy us drinks.
Two.
I haven' t had a drink in two years, but I' il have one with you.
One last whiskey with my boy.
Take our time with it... taste the barley, let it linger.
And then I' il go.
I want you to keep that.
I' il hold it for you.
Don' t ever come visit. "
I' il tell you, "I believe in God' s Kingdom,
"and I believe I' il be with you again and your mother, but not in this lifetime."
You get a job somewhere... a job that pays cash, a boss who doesn' t ask questions.
And you make a new life and you never come back.
Monty, people like you.
It' s a gift.
- How you fellas doin '?
You' re gonna work hard.
You' re gonna keep your head down and your mouth shut.
You' re gonna make yourself a new home out there.
Here you go, James.
Thanks a lot.
You' re a New Yorker.
That will never change.
You got New York in your bones.
Spend the rest of your life out west, but you' re still a New Yorker.
You' il miss your friends, you' il miss your dog, but you' re strong.
You got your mother' s backbone in you.
You' re strong like she was.
Why don' t you go ahead and have a seat?
A driver' s license.
- What' s your name?
- Uh, James.
James.
No, I' m from out west.
Well, let' s go ahead and get your picture.
Okay.
Why don' t you give me a bigger smile, James?
Okay.
You forget your old life.
You can' t come back.
You can' t call.
You can' t write.
You never look back.
You make a new life for yourself, and you live it.
You hear me?
You live your life the way it should have been.
This is dangerous, but maybe after a couple of years, you send word to Naturelle.
BOTH:
- Happy New Year.
Feel that right there.
Your mother' s a lunatic.
I need company.
You get yourself a new family, and you raise them right, you hear me?
Give them a good life, Monty.
Give them what they need.
You have a son.
Maybe you name him James.
It' s a good, strong name.
long after I' m dead and gone, reunited with your dear mother, you gather your whole family together and tell them the truth, who you are and where you come from.
I was arrested.
And then you ask them if they know how lucky they are to be there.
It all came so close to never happening.... came so close to never happening.
This life came so close to never happening.
"The dual substance of Christ - the yearning, so human, so superhuman, of man to attain God... has always been a deep inscrutable mystery to me.
My principle anguish and source of all my joys and sorrows from my youth onward has been the incessant, merciless battle between the spirit and the flesh... and my soul is the arena where these two armies have clashed and met. "
NlKOS KAZANTZAKlS
From the book "The Last Temptation Of Christ"
This film is not based upon the Gospels but upon this fictional exploration of the eternal spiritual conflict.
The feeling begins.
Very tender, very loving.
Then the pain starts.
Claws slip underneath the skin and tear their way up...... just before they reach my eyes, they dig in.
And I remember.
First I fasted for three months.
I even whipped myself before I went to sleep.
At first it worked.
And the voices.
They call me by name.
Jesus.
Who is it?
Who are you?
Why are you following me?
Are you ready?
No more crosses.
We' re ready.
Where is your mind?
Do you hear what I' m saying?
The Messiah won' t come that way.
What do you mean by that?
Who told you?
You' re a disgrace!
You do it!
You' re worse than them!
You' re a Jew killing Jews.
You' re a coward!
How will you ever pay for your sins?
With my life, Judas.
I don' t have anything else.
Don' t turn away.
Look at me.
What do you mean?
Please, Judas.
I don' t know.
Are you still taking the cross?
- Yes, I am.
- No, you' re not.
I won' t let you!
- I won' t let you.
- Please, I beg you, don' t get in the way.
What way?
- What' s happened to you?
- I' m struggling.
- With who?
- I don' t know.
I' m struggling.
I struggle.
You collaborate.
Traitor!
You are the people of lsrael.
Your children are watching.
You are the people of God.
He is judging us.
He is watching you.
- There he is.
- Kill him!
Don' t touch him.
Get away from him!
- Don' t you defend him.
- He' s my son.
God is with us.
Fight!
God help us!
God give us strength!
Come.
Come with me.
"This man, naked before you now, is condemned for sedition...
SEDlTIO
"He rallied the people to revolution.
"He promised that a Messiah would come from among the people...
"... to rise up and destroy Rome."
Rome is nothing.
"Murder...
"... betrayal...
"... looting and so on, and so therefore, he is condemned to die.
"Rome condemns him.
"And all the gods of Rome condemn him."
God is our shield.
He is our heart.
He is our shield.
He will not abandon you.
God!
God loves me, I know he loves me.
I want him to stop.
I can' t take the pain.
The voices and the pain.
I want him to hate me.
I fight him.
I make crosses so he' il hate me.
I want him to find somebody else.
I want to crucify every one of his messiahs.
You' re sure it' s not the devil?
I' m not sure.
- I' m not sure of anything.
- If it' s the devil, the deviI can be cast out.
But what if it' s God?
You can' t cast out God, can you?
Who' s that?
Who' s following me?
Is that you?
Magdalene.
Thank you, Lord...... for bringing me where I did not want to go.
He must be one of God' s angels.
He came down to show me the way.
Who' s out there?
Who is it?
What are you doing here?
I want you to forgive me.
I' ve done too many bad things.
I' m going to the desert, and I need you to forgive me...... before I go, please.
I see.
You sit out there all day with the others...... and then come in here with your head down, saying, "Forgive me."
"Forgive me."
It' s not that easy.
Just because you need forgiveness, don' t ask me to do it.
Go away!
Look, Mary...... look at this.
God can change this.
God can save your soul.
He already broke my heart, he took you away from me.
And I hate both of you.
Hate me, blame me.
It' s all my fault, but not God' s.
- Don' t say that about God.
- Who made me feel this way about God?
I know, that' s why I' m here.
It' s why I want you to forgive me.
I' il pay my debt.
I know...... there are some things I' ve done, and to you.
Pay or go away.
Don' t you remember?
No, I don' t remember.
Nothing' s changed.
Say the truth.
If you want to save my soul...... this is where you' il find it.
You' re the same as all the others, only you can' t admit it.
You' re pitiful.
I hate you.
Here' s my body.
Save it.
ls that the way you show you' re a man?
Turn away, don' t look at me.
Don' t look at me!
If you weren' t hanging on to your mother, you were hanging on to me.
Now you' re hanging on to God...... going to the desert to hide because you' re scared.
Go.
Whenever I see you, my heart breaks.
I do remember when we were children.
Never have I felt so much tenderness toward anyone...... as I felt toward you then.
All I ever wanted was you.
Nothing else.
What do you think I wanted?
Stay.
ls it so bad sharing a prostitute' s room?
I won' t touch you.
You' il still be a virgin for the desert.
I can' t stay.
Welcome.
This way.
Do you always pray this late at night?
It' s a funeral.
The master of the monastery died.
Shall I pray with you?
Sleep.
You must be tired.
I know who you are.
That was the man who brought me here last night.
Last night?
He was dead last night.
The master' s soul has gone to heaven.
His body' s work is completed.
It walked under the sun and the moon...... over sand and stone...... sinned, felt pain...... yearned for heaven.
We commend his remains to our God.
Flesh...... the master no longer needs you.
Melt away.
First came the wings, then the angel.
His spirit actually appeared to you.
He treated you like a royal visitor.
He recognized you for something.
He couldn' t have recognized me for anything.
That' s all.
That' s all God wants from me.
I' m sure of it.
Think of how you' re blessed.
God actually makes himself known to you.
I don' t know what God wants from me.
All my life I' ve wanted to hear God' s voice.
I' ve dedicated my life to him.
Sometimes...... I think I feel him, but I' m never really sure.
But you always know.
God took you by the hand and brought you here.
You think it' s a blessing to know what God wants?
He wants to push me over!
All my sins.
- Not my sins.
I' m a liar.
A hypocrite.
I' m afraid of everything.
I don' t tell the truth.
I don' t have the courage.
When I see a woman, I blush and look away.
I want her, but I don' t take her, for God, and that makes me proud.
Then my pride ruins Magdalene.
I don' t steal, I don' t fight...... I don' t kill.
Not because I don' t want to, but because I' m afraid.
I want to rebel against you, against everything...... against God, but...... I' m afraid.
You want to know who my mother and father are?
You want to know who my God is?
Fear.
You look inside me and that' s all you' il find.
But the more devils we have inside of us, the more of a chance we have to repent.
Lucifer is inside me.
He says to me, "You' re not the son of King David.
"You' re not a man, you' re the Son of man.
"And more, the Son of God.
And more than that, God. "
Do you want to ask me anything else?
Everything is from God.
Everything has two meanings.
Jesus, my sweet Jesus.
I forgive you.
Leave me!
They' ve gone.
You have to leave, too.
- No, I have to stay.
- No.
You' ve been purified.
God has just blessed you.
The snakes came from inside you.
Now you have to leave, too.
You have to go back...... and speak to people and share your heart.
Speak to who?
To anyone who will listen.
And say what?
Just open your mouth.
Do you love mankind?
I see men and I feel sorry for them, that' s all.
That' s enough.
- I' ve got orders to kill you.
- Go ahead.
Tonight I was purified.
Here' s my neck.
Cut it, I' m ready.
What are you?
What kind of a man are you?
What you want, I want.
That' s why he brought us together, it' s God' s plan.
I come to kill you and you help me, that' s God' s plan?
You' d better make me understand it, too.
I' il tell you as much as I know.
The fainting spells, the voices, the visions.
Power.
Magic.
ls there some secret?
Tell me your secret.
Pity.
Pity for who?
Yourself?
Pity for men.
Our enemies are men.
I feel pity for everything.
Donkeys...
-... grass, sparrows.
You feel pity for them, too?
Yes.
Everything' s a part of God.
When I see an ant, when I look at his shiny black eye...... you know what I see?
I see the face of God.
You' re not afraid of dying?
Why should I be?
Death isn' t a door that closes, it opens.
It opens and you go through it.
If I don' t kill you, what happens?
I' il speak to people.
What are you going to say?
I' il just open my mouth and God will do the talking.
Maybe God didn' t send you here to kill me.
Maybe he sent you here to follow me.
Just so there' s no mistake.
I' il go with you until I understand.
But if you stray this much...... from the path, I' il kill you.
It' s Magdalene.
She deserves it.
Get out of there.
This is not your business.
Do you want to get hurt?
- Did you hear what he said, idiot?
Move!
- No.
I don' t want this.
Listen to him.
He doesn' t want this.
- Why?
- We don' t have to tell you why!
We live in a whorehouse.
She works on the Sabbath.
She goes with Romans on the Sabbath.
She dies.
Who?
Which one of you people has never sinned?
Whoever that is, come up here!
And throw these!
I have nothing to hide.
It' s bigger.
Be careful, Zebedee.
There is a God.
He' s seen you cheat your workers.
He' s seen you with that widow, what' s her name?
Judith.
Aren' t you afraid God will paralyze you if you lift that stone?
That your arm will wither?
That you' il lose all strength?
God has so many miracles.
What if I say the wrong thing?
What if I say the right thing?
Come closer.
We' re all a family.
Come closer, so you can hear.
I have something to tell you.
Who is he?
It' s Jesus from Nazareth.
Nothing good can come out of Nazareth, even the Scriptures say so.
I' m sorry, but...
... the easiest way to make myself clear...... is to tell you a story.
A farmer was planting in his field.
Some seed fell on the ground and the birds ate it.
Some seed fell on rocks and dried up.
Some seed fell on rich soil...... and grew into enough wheat to feed a whole nation.
Can you hear me?
We can hear you fine.
The farmer is me.
And 2 and 2 makes 4.
Another lunatic!
Rabbi...... tell me, if you' re the farmer...... and we' re the stones, what' s the seed?
What' s the seed?
Love.
Love one another.
That' s easy to say, maybe that' s good advice, but for some other world.
These people are starving.
First you feed them, then you talk!
I used to think God was angry, too, but not anymore!
He used to jump on me like a wild bird and dig his claws into my head.
But then one morning, he came to me.
He blew over me like a cool breeze and said, "Stand up."
And here I am.
And you will go to hell.
These are children' s stories.
How can they help us?
What are you hungry for?
What are you thirsty for?
For justice!
- And bread!
- Bread, too.
You' re thirsty for justice, for people to treat you fairly...... for people to treat you with respect.
What I' m telling you is...... whoever' s hungry for justice, they are the ones who' il be blessed.
They' il be filled with bread.
They' il never be hungry again.
They' lI have the real value, the value of love.
To love, share and comfort.
They' lI have the courage to do the good.
You' re mourning.
Mourners will be blessed.
You' lI have God to comfort you.
You won' t need men to do it.
They' re the ones who' il be blessed.
And the suffering, they' il be blessed, too.
And the peacemakers and the merciful...... and the sick, and the poor, and the outcasts...... you' il all be blessed because heaven is yours!
And believe me...
... believe me, those who are laughing now...... will be crying later.
Those whose stomachs are filled now will be hungry later.
And the rich will be poor forever!
Kill them!
I said love!
I said love!
Enough.
Come.
No, Father, I' m staying.
We have to work.
I need you!
- Come.
- I' m sorry, Father, I' m staying, too.
Come on!
Let me come with you, I can help.
Stay here.
You' il know when.
Tell people about me.
James.
Andrew.
Move over, John.
Move over, James.
I was just comfortable.
- Peter wants to lay down.
- Peter, there' s no more room.
I' m cold.
I want to be by the fire.
Go over by Philip.
We' re all cold.
Shut up.
Rabbi, can I talk to you?
I' m not like these other men.
I mean, they' re good enough, they' re good men.
One' s worse than the other.
Where' d you find them?
Look at me.
If I love somebody, I would die for them.
If I hate somebody, I' d kill them.
I could even kill somebody I loved if they did the wrong thing.
Did you hear me?
Do you understand what I said?
Yes, I understand.
The other day you said, if a man hit you, you' d turn the other cheek.
I didn' t like that.
Only an angel could do that, or a dog.
I' m sorry but I' m neither.
I' m a free man.
I don' t turn my cheek to anyone.
We both want the same thing.
We do?
- Do you want freedom for lsrael?
- No.
I want freedom for the soul.
That' s what I can' t accept.
That' s not the same thing!
First you free the body, then the spirit!
The Romans come first.
You don' t build a house from the roof down but from the foundation up.
- The foundation is the soul.
- The foundation is the body.
That' s where you must begin.
If you don' t change the spirit first, change what' s inside...... then you' il only replace the Romans with someone else, and nothing changes.
Even if you' re victorious, you' il still be filled with the poison.
You' ve got to break the chain of evil.
How do you change then?
With love.
- Who' s there?
- It' s me, Andrew.
ls everything....
It' s all right.
Go back to sleep.
Judas and I are talking.
There' s an example.
You know, the Zealots ordered me to kill you.
Why did you change your mind?
I decided to wait.
For what?
I thought maybe you were the One.
To unite us.
I didn' t want to destroy that.
How do we know?
How could I be the Messiah?
When those people were torturing Magdalene, I wanted to kill them.
Why?
I don' t understand.
I can' t look to the others for answers, all they do is follow you.
We' il go to Judea and see John the Baptist.
Every day he tells hundreds of people the Messiah is coming.
He' il know.
He' il know.
I' m afraid.
Stay with me.
Behold!
I will raise up evil against you out of your own house...... and I will take your wives, before your eyes...... and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives...... in the sight of this sun.
You may listen and listen again...... but you will never understand.
You may look, but you will never know.
These people' s wits are dulled.
Their ears are deafened and their eyes blinded...... so they cannot see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears...... so that they may turn and be healed.
The Lord of Hosts says:
"On this day..."
He sounds like the Messiah.
No. "... I will crush the horns of the new moon and I will spill darkness over the world.
"I will reverse your laughter, turn it into tears...."
Go in front.
Let him see you.
"Listen, it is the thunder of many peoples...."
Even from behind, I knew I had seen him before.
Where?
Was it a dream?
Yes, it was.
But in the dream, he was dressed in white.
"You wilI have the smell of decay...
"... and branding, instead of beauty.
Your men shall fall by the sword... "... and your women shall sit on the ground, stripped bare."
Who are you?
Do you recognize me?
Who are you?
Do you know the Prophets?
What does lsaiah say?
He says, "Prepare the way of the Lord."
- Are you telling me that' s you?
Tell me.
Why are you here?
To be baptized.
No, I don' t dare.
If you' re the Master, then you have to baptize me.
Baptize me.
Love.
What does it mean?
Love is sweet as honey.
But it' s also blood.
Love is action.
You want a new crop, you burn the earth.
But isn' t love enough?
No!
Look at the world.
Look around you.
Plague, war, corruption...... false prophets, false idols, worship of gold.
Nothing is of value.
The tree is rotten.
You have to take the axe and cut it down.
If I was a woodcutter, I' d cut.
If I was a fire, I' d burn.
But I' m a heart and I love and that' s all I can do.
I' m a heart, also.
But I can' t love what' s unjust.
What I can' t love, I attack.
God demands it.
- Anger?
- Yes, God demands anger.
Anger?
But we' re all brothers.
You think love is God' s only way?
Go to the Dead Sea, look in the bottom.
You' lI see two whores, Sodom and Gomorrah.
That' s God' s way.
On the day of the Lord...... blood will flow from wood.
The stones of the houses will come alive and kill their owners.
That day is here.
Now I give it to you.
That' s not the answer.
Then what is the answer?
I don' t know.
Well, if you won' t listen to me, who will you listen to?
God.
The God of lsrael is the God of the desert.
If you want to speak to him, then you' lI have to go to the desert.
I' il go to ldumaea.
Thank you, Baptist.
Be careful.
God isn' t alone out there.
I feel sorry for you.
You were lonely.
You cried.
So I came.
I didn' t call for you.
Who are you?
Your spirit.
My spirit?
You' re afraid of being alone.
You' re just like Adam.
He called me and I took one of his ribs...... and made it into a woman.
You' re here to trick me.
Trick you?
To love and care for a woman, to have a family, is this a trick?
Why are you trying to save the world?
Aren' t your own sins enough for you?
What arrogance to think you can save the world.
The world doesn' t have to be saved.
Save yourself.
Find love.
I have love.
Look...... in my eyes.
Look at my breasts.
Do you recognize them?
Just nod your head...... and we' il be in my bed together.
Jesus.
After ten days...... the hunger went away.
Welcome, Jesus.
Congratulations.
You' re past the small temptations of a woman and a family.
We' re both bigger than that.
- Who are you?
- You don' t recognize me?
I' m you, I' m your heart.
Your heart is so greedy.
It pretends to be humble...... but it really wants to conquer the world.
I never wanted a kingdom on earth.
- The kingdom of heaven is enough.
- You' re a liar.
When you were making crosses for the Romans...... your head was exploding with dreams ofpower.
Power over everyone.
You said it was God, but you really wanted power.
Now you can have what you want.
Any country you want.
All of them.
- You could even have Rome.
- Liar.
Step into my circle so I can pull your tongue out.
Archangel, move back.
Move back, you' re blinding me.
Jesus.
I' m the one you' ve been waiting for.
Remember...... when you were a little boy...... you cried..
"Make me a god, God.
"God.
"God, make me a god."
But I was just a child then.
You are God.
You are his son.
The only Son of God.
Join me.
Together we' il rule the living and the dead.
You' il give life and you' il take life.
You' il sit in judgement, and I' il sit next to you.
Imagine how strong we' d be together.
Satan?
We' lI see each other again.
Don' t be afraid.
You are the One.
My work is done.
Now I can die.
The Lord wants me to tell you to stand up.
His day is here.
Take this axe.
Take this message to everyone.
Please.
What do you want?
I' m a foreigner.
From Galilee.
I' m tired.
You don' t know how good this tastes.
Some more wine, please.
Mary...... Martha...... I want to say that you' re both blessed.
I came here, you didn' t know me.
You took me in, fed me, restored me...... and God came down and went into my heart.
- No.
I' ve talked too much already.
Silence is better.
No, it' s not.
Do you have a wife?
No.
How can you live like that in the desert?
Tell me the truth.
Having a home, a real life.
I' d like it, but I' il never have it.
Listen, if you really want God, don' t spend your time in the desert.
He' s not there, he' s right here.
God does not want you to fast and pray.
He wants you to make children.
Mary, you' re making him uncomfortable.
He' s a guest.
He knows what I' m talking about.
Come and help me.
It' s not right to tease these men.
I wasn' t teasing.
Remember the Baptist?
It' s nothing to tease about.
You didn' t know?
They say the king was drunk and cut off the Baptist' s head to satisfy him.
Now they say they' re going to kill everyone who was baptized.
No one forced you to be baptized.
You were baptized, too.
So be quiet.
I can just imagine in Galilee right now.
The sea.
They say the fishing' s so good you just touch the nets and the fish jump in.
Don' t talk about fish.
It reminds me of my sheep.
I don' t know what' s happened to them.
Maybe we should wait for him in Galilee.
No, we promised the Master we would wait here.
That was over a month ago.
Thousands of people are waiting to see and to hear him and he' s gone.
We look like fools.
Nathaniel' s right.
He makes sense.
Let' s return to Galilee.
If we go back to Galilee, like Peter says --
Brothers!
I don' t understand you.
Think of the last words the Baptist said.
He said, "Jesus of Nazareth, leave the desert.
I am finished.
"You return to mankind."
How do we know he really said that?
- Everybody says he did.
- But how do we know?
- Even if he didn' t, the words are important.
- Why?
Because people believe them.
And what if our Master' s....
What if he' s the One?
What "One"?
- The One.
The Messiah?
We don' t know the Baptist said that.
Nobody knows.
He' s not like Elijah.
He' s saying that the world of God is here now.
He just meant, "Continue my work.
"Continue to do the work I' ve been doing."
Right here Elijah ascended to heaven.
Doesn' t that mean something to you?
We' re waiting here.
I don' t think we should go back to Galilee.
I think we should wait here.
That' s what I love about you, Peter.
You' re as steady and as solid as a rock.
Nobody can change your mind.
What good are you?
Master.
Rabbi.
John heard your footsteps in his heart...... in a way, and we were preparing to welcome you.
Were you baptized?
Yes.
John baptized with water and they killed him.
Now I baptize with fire.
ls that what the Baptist told you?
I have an invitation for you.
ls there a celebration?
No.
I' m inviting you to a war.
This is my heart.
Take it.
God is inside of us.
The devil is outside us, in the world all around us.
We' il pick up an axe and cut the devil' s throat.
We' il fight him wherever he is.
In the sick...... in the rich...... even in the temple.
I' il lead you.
If you have sheep...... give them away.
If you have a family...... leave them.
I believed in love.
Now I believe in this!
Who' s with me?
Adonai.
Today and tomorrow I cast out devils and work cures.
On the third day...... I shall be perfected.
Out!
Satan, leave!
Satan, out!
Leave him!
Moses, Elijah, lsaiah...... touch my mouth...... touch my lips.
Go to the temple.
Let the high priests see you.
Look!
He was blind and Jesus healed him.
Look.
You don' t belong at a wedding.
We' re here to celebrate purity.
I' m sorry, but these people are my guests.
Let me explain something to you.
What do you think heaven' s like?
God' s the bridegroom and man' s spirit' s the bride.
The wedding takes place in heaven...... and everyone' s invited.
God' s world is big enough for everyone.
Nazarene, that' s against the law.
Then the law' s against my heart.
Don' t touch me.
You are now sacred to me...... through this ring.
"You are now sacred to me, through this ring."
According to the law of Moses and lsrael.
"According to the law of Moses and lsrael."
My cousins are very upset.
They only brought enough wine for 3 days.
Now another day' s gone past and it' s gone.
What' s in those?
- Water.
It' s wine.
No, it' s water.
I put it there myself.
- It' s wine.
- It' s water.
Go over there and make sure.
Do it.
You' re right.
It is wine.
Brothers!
My old friends!
Listen to me.
It' s me the Prophets preached about.
God talked to me in the desert.
He gave me a secret and told me to bring it to you.
Didn' t you hear me coming?
I ran here to Nazareth, where I grew up, to bring you the news.
The world of God is here now.
Make a miracle for us.
Otherwise go away.
The Messiah doesn' t need miracles.
He is the miracle.
Now he' s here.
Are you ready for me?
I' m here to tear down everything around you.
You know what I' il replace it with?
Something new.
God.
The world of God.
So take your bread and give it to the poor.
What difference does it make what you own?
It' s going to rot.
That rot is going to eat away your hearts.
There will be a flood and a fire.
Everything will be destroyed.
But there will be a new ark riding on that fire!
And I hold the keys and I open the door.
And I decide who goes in and who doesn' t.
You' re my brothers from Nazareth and you' re the first I invite on the ark.
Don' t wait.
Don' t waste your life.
Come with me.
You' re the son of Mary, right?
Who are you to tell us about God?
He made better crosses than speeches.
Go get someone from his family to take him away.
He' s insane.
What are you laughing at?
Everything you have will burn.
Get out now!
Come with me to Jerusalem!
See?
This is what happens when a man doesn' t get married.
The semen backs up into his brain.
Go home!
You' re a demon.
You' re possessed.
You' re a lunatic!
This is my home!
- You should be ashamed.
- Kill him!
He' s going to burn us.
Don' t touch him!
If I could touch every stone...... if I could breathe on every branch, they' d get up and follow me!
So what' s wrong with you?
Come with me to Jerusalem!
Jerusalem is falling!
I feel it.
I know it.
You see these people?
They' re blind.
They' re going to be our army.
We' re going to need better men than this.
God will give them to me.
We' re going to build a new Jerusalem.
Please.
Who are you?
- Your mother.
- I don' t have a mother.
I don' t have any family.
I have a Father, in heaven.
Don' t say that to me.
Who are you?
I mean, really.
Who are you?
Why are you crying?
Didn' t you see them?
What?
When he spoke to you, there were thousands of blue wings behind him.
I swear to you, Mary, there were armies of angels.
- There were?
- Thousands.
I' d be happier if there weren' t.
When was he buried?
Three days ago.
Roll away the stone.
Lazarus.
In the name of the Prophets...... in the name of Jeremiah and my Father...... in the name of the most holy God...... I call you here.
I call you here!
Lazarus.
Adonai.
God, help me.
We came here to pray.
Look at this.
The money- changers?
It' s for the temple tax, for the feast.
I know.
How' s the exchange today?
Fair.
At this stall it' s always fair.
Making a good profit?
Fair.
This is my Father' s house!
It is a place of worship...... not a market!
Nazarene, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
He doesn' t need shekels!
They have images of false gods on them!
You want pagan gods in the temple?
All foreign coins have to be exchanged for shekels.
I' m throwing away the law.
I have a new law and a new hope.
What?
Has God changed his mind about the old law?
He just thinks our hearts are ready to hold more, that' s all.
How can you presume --
How can I presume?
I' m the end of the old law and the beginning of the new one.
- Watch what you' re saying.
- Maybe we should go.
When I say, "I," Rabbi...... I' m saying "God."
That' s blasphemy.
Didn' t they tell you?
I' m the saint of blasphemy.
Don' t make any mistakes.
I came to bring a sword.
Talking like that will get you killed.
Me killed?
Listen to me.
Torn down to the ground!
There won' t be one stone left to build with!
He doesn' t.
God' s an immortal spirit who belongs to everybody...... to the whole world!
You think you' re special?
God is not an lsraelite!
Magician, heal me.
Make us rich.
Heal me!
Do a miracle.
You want me to enter the world of God crippled like this?
Don' t touch me!
God won' t help you.
You cure us, or you won' t leave this city alive.
You don' t make demands on God!
Judas!
What are you doing with this magician?
You had orders to kill him and you haven' t done it.
Now he acts like a prophet and you follow him.
Did you hear what he said back there, Saul?
Yes, I heard him.
All I see are Jews against Jews.
Then you' re not listening.
Lazarus.
How do you feel?
I like the light.
What was it like?
Which is better, death or life?
I was a little surprised.
There wasn' t that much difference.
Give me your hand.
I' m not surprised.
How could they let Lazarus live?
He was proof of your greatest miracle.
Now there' s no more proof.
That' s what the Zealots want.
Their revolution, not yours.
You want to go back to them?
No.
You' re the one I follow.
You are the strongest, aren' t you?
Of all my friends...... you' re the strongest.
Judas, my brother...... I' ve something to tell you.
I have a terrible secret from God.
- You know why I came to Jerusalem?
- Yes.
This is where the revolution is going to begin.
Last night lsaiah came to me.
I saw it written.
It said..
"He has borne our faults..."... he was wounded for our transgressions...
"... yet he opened not his mouth.
"Despised and rejected by all...
"... he went forward without resisting, like a lamb led to the slaughter."
I don' t understand.
Judas, I am the lamb.
I' m the one who' s going to die.
Die?
- You mean you' re not the Messiah?
- I am.
That can' t be.
If you' re the Messiah, why do you have to die?
- Listen.
At first, I didn' t understand -- - No, you, listen!
Every day you have a different plan!
First it' s love, then it' s the axe, and now you have to die.
- What good could that do?
- I can' t help it.
God only talks to me a little at a time.
He tells me as much as I need to know.
- We need you alive!
- Now I finally understand.
All my life I' ve been followed...... by voices...... by footsteps...... by shadows.
And do you know what the shadow is?
The cross.
I have to die on the cross and I have to die willingly.
We have to go back to the temple.
After you die on the cross, what happens then?
I come back to judge the living and the dead.
You have to.
I' m worried he' s going to change his mind again.
No, he won' t.
This time we' re not going to the temple to pray.
He said he' il destroy the temple in three days, and he' il do it.
And what if he doesn' t?
- What then?
- What if he doesn' t?
You won' t have to worry because we' il all be dead.
We' re setting up a new government, building a new Jerusalem.
We can ask for anything we want.
First, I' d like more sheep.
You know, my other sheep, I don' t even know where they are now.
This time I want a large herd, and I' il get other shepherds to care for them.
I would just like to be able to worship in the temple.
I mean really worship, without Roman banners and soldiers.
That' s what I' d like.
Of course.
But what else?
I' il do anything the Master asks, anything but get crucified.
- You' re a coward, Thomas.
- Yes, I am.
You know why?
Have you ever seen anyone on a cross after two days?
You know what they look like?
They don' t even have eyes.
The crows come and suck out your eyes.
And after that, you know what?
Dogs come and rip your feet off.
Don' t talk that way.
I' ve made my decision.
You make yours.
And if you can' t, then get out now before we get to Jerusalem.
I' m ready.
I have my knife.
Will there be angels there to meet us?
Or anyone besides who' s here?
Master.
King of the Jews!
King of the Jews!
Jesus!
Lord, I hope this is what you want.
Let me die here.
Please let it happen fast while I have the strength.
I am here to set fire to the world.
In the desert, the Baptist warned us, God is coming.
Well, I' m telling you it' s too late.
He' s already here.
I' m here.
I' m going to baptize everybody with fire!
He' s leading us!
Follow him!
They' re all with you, waiting for your signal.
Give it!
Do it now!
Please!
I' m waiting, too.
Give me an axe, not the cross.
Let me die like this.
Give the sign now or we' re finished.
- They' il kill us -- - We came to fight, not to die!
Master, we knew it would be like this.
This is the way.
Judas, help me!
Stay with me.
Don' t leave me.
I wish there was another way.
I' m sorry, but there isn' t.
I have to die on the cross.
I won' t let you die.
You have no choice, neither do I.
Remember, we' re bringing God and man together.
They' il never be together unless I die.
I' m the sacrifice.
Without you, there can be no redemption.
Forget everything else.
No, I can' t.
Get somebody stronger.
You promised me.
Remember, you once told me...... that if I moved one step from revolution, you' d kill me.
Remember?
Yes.
I' ve strayed, haven' t I?
Yes.
Then you must keep your promise.
You have to kill me.
If that' s what God wants, let God do it.
I won' t.
He will do it through you.
The temple guards will be looking for me where there aren' t any crowds.
We' il go to Gethsemane.
You' il make sure that they find me there.
I am going to die.
But after three days...... I' il come back, in victory.
You can' t leave me.
You have to give me strength.
If you were me, could you betray your master?
No.
That' s why God gave me the easier job...... to be crucified.
What about the others?
I' il tell them tonight.
Listen to me.
Take this bread.
Share it together.
This bread is my body.
Now drink this wine.
Pass the cup.
This wine is my blood.
Do this to remember me.
We' re not finished.
Let him go.
All of you...... I want to tell you something.
Wait for me here.
Father in heaven.
Father on earth.
The world...... that you' ve created, that we can see, is beautiful.
But the world you' ve created, that we can' t see, is beautiful, too.
I don' t know.
I don' t know which is more beautiful.
This is my body, too.
Together...... we' re going to die.
Please, Father.
I' ve been with you for so long.
I never asked you to choose me.
I always did as you said.
You made many miracles for others.
You opened the Red Sea for Moses.
You saved Noah.
You took Elijah to heaven in a fiery chariot...... and now you' re asking me to be crucified.
Can I ask you...... one last time?
ls there any other way?
You' re offering me a cup, but I don' t want to drink what' s in it.
Please, take it away.
Please, stop.
Father.
Please.
ls this your answer?
All right.
Just please give me the strength.
Couldn' t you stay awake with me for just an hour?
I' m sorry.
It doesn' t matter.
It' s too late.
Welcome, Rabbi.
No.
You live by this, you die by it.
Take me with you.
I' m ready.
So, you are the King of the Jews?
"King" is your word.
Well, you are Jesus of Nazareth, aren' t you?
Yes, I am.
The King, the Messiah.
It' s also said that you do miracles.
ls this good magic or bad magic?
Could we have some kind of a demonstration?
I mean, can you do a trick for me, now?
I' m not a magician.
That' s disappointing.
This means that you' re just another Jewish politician.
Do you want to know something?
Do you know that?
Say something.
You had better say something.
All right.
Tell me what you tell people on the streets.
- Yes.
The prophet DanieI had a vision:
The stomach was bronze, the legs were iron, the feet were clay.
A stone was thrown.
The clay feet broke and the statue collapsed.
You see, God threw the stone.
The stone is me.
And Rome --
And Rome is the statue, yes.
So your kingdom, or your world, will replace Rome.
Where is it?
My kingdom?
It' s not here.
Not on earth.
It wouldn' t be, would it?
It' s one thing to want to change the way that people live...... but you want to change how they think, how they feel.
All I' m saying is that change will happen with love, not with killing.
It' s against the way the world is.
And killing or loving, it' s all the same.
It simply doesn' t matter how you want to change things.
We don' t want them changed.
You do understand what has to happen?
We have a space for you up on Golgotha.
Probably more.
Guard.
I do wish you people would go out and count them some time.
Maybe you' d learn a lesson.
Probably not.
I know you.
I saw you with him.
You must be mistaken.
It must have been someone else.
No, I' m right.
He is one of his followers.
- He doesn' t know what he' s talking about.
- He is one of his followers.
It' s him!
Get him!
Mother?
Magdalene?
Where are you?
Mother, I' m sorry for being a bad son.
Father, stay with me.
Don' t leave me.
Father, forgive them.
Father!
Why have you forsaken me?
Who are you?
I' m the angel who guards you.
Your Father is the God of mercy, not punishment.
He saw you and said, "Aren' t you his guardian angel?
"Well, go down and save him.
He' s suffered enough. "
Remember when he told Abraham to sacrifice his son?
Abraham was just about to kill the boy with his knife when God stopped him.
So, if he saved Abraham' s son, don' t you think he' d want to save his own?
He' s tested you and he' s happy with you.
He doesn' t want your blood.
He said, "Let him die in a dream.
But let him live his life. "
All the pain.
That was real.
Yes, but there won' t be any more.
You' ve done enough.
I don' t have to be sacrificed?
No, you don' t.
I' m not the Messiah?
No, you' re not.
What about the others?
Don' t look back there.
God gave you life.
Look ahead.
Where are the disciples?
They became frightened and ran away.
ls this the world of God?
The one I spoke about?
No, this is earth.
Why has it changed so much?
You have.
Now you can see its real beauty.
Harmony between earth and the heart, that' s the world of God.
Maybe you' il find this hard to believe...... but sometimes we angels look down on men and envy you.
What' s that?
A wedding ceremony.
Who' s getting married?
You are.
What' s wrong?
Why are you crying?
I' m thanking God...... for bringing you here.
We could have a child.
Where are you going?
Who are you going to kill?
Didn' t you hear me, Jesus?
There is nothing you can do.
God' s killed her.
God took her away when she was happy.
Now she' s immortal.
She won' t see her love die or body decay.
I was there the whole time he was killing her and saw what happened.
It wasn' t right for God to take her.
You didn' t complain when God let you live.
You can' t complain now because he let her die.
Trust God' s way.
There' s only one woman in the world.
One woman with many faces.
This one falls, the next one rises.
Mary Magdalene died...... but Mary, Lazarus' s sister...... she lives.
She' s Magdalene with a different face.
She' s carrying your greatest joy inside her.
Your son.
Come with me.
This is the way the Savior comes.
Gradually, from embrace to embrace.
From son to son.
This is the road.
I understand.
Mary.
Look.
Rabbi, I just want to see if it' s really you.
He' s real, like us.
Don' t you see?
Come in.
Come here.
Master, I want to tell you one thing.
I' m sorry about Magdalene.
I won' t ever leave you alone again.
I' il always protect you.
I don' t want you to take the wrong road and get lost again.
Come inside.
I' il cook for you and your friend.
Are you satisfied with me?
Do you have any complaints?
None.
I' m ashamed when I think of it.
Of what?
Of all the mistakes I' ve made.
Of all the wrong ways I looked for God.
Where' s Mary?
She won' t be back till this evening.
Come inside.
It' s too hot out here.
Come inside.
There' s only one woman in the world.
Go inside.
We don' t have to get involved.
Come on, stay out of it.
Here, watch your brother.
Remember to thank God for the food and leave some for me.
I' il be back soon.
- Aren' t you going to eat?
- I want to hear what he says.
You don' t have to go there.
I lied, I stole, I cheated...... I gambled, I whored, I drank and persecuted, tortured and murdered.
Yes, murdered!
I killed anyone who broke the law of Moses.
And I loved it, I enjoyed it, I relished it, I reveled in it.
Because I thought I was doing God' s will.
I thought I was doing God' s will.
And on the road to Damascus, just outside the city, in the middle of the day...... I was struck by a white light that blinded me!
Yes.
And I heard a voice say:
"Saul, why are you persecuting me?
"Why are you against me?"
"Who are you?" I said.
And the voice said:
"Jesus."
And he...... made me see.
I was led helpless like a child, into a city that I was sent to scourge.
And God sent me Ananias instead...... and he put his hands on me and I opened my eyes...... and I was baptized and became Paul.
It' s about Jesus of Nazareth.
He was the Son of God.
His mother was a virgin.
And the angel Gabriel came down and put God' s seed in her womb.
That' s how he was born.
And he was punished for our sins.
Then he was tortured and crucified.
But three days later he rose up from the dead...... and went up to heaven.
Death was conquered!
Amen.
Do you understand what that means?
He conquered death.
All of our sins were forgiven...... and now the world of God is open to every one of us.
To everybody!
Did you ever see this Jesus of Nazareth after he came back from the dead?
I mean, with your own eyes?
No, but I saw a light that blinded me and I heard his voice.
- You' re a liar.
- His disciples saw him.
They were hiding in an attic, the doors locked, and he appeared to them.
Liar.
He' s a liar!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, I want to talk to you.
I never came back from the dead.
I' m a man.
Quiet!
Why are you telling these lies?
What are you talking about?
I' m the son of Mary and Joseph.
I' m the one who preached in Galilee.
I had followers, we marched on Jerusalem.
Pilate condemned me and God saved me.
No, he didn' t.
Who are you talking about?
Don' t try to tell me what happened, because I know.
I live like a man now.
I work, eat, have children.
For the first time, I' m enjoying it.
Do you understand me?
So don' t go around telling lies about me, or I' il tell everybody the truth!
Wait just a minute.
What' s the matter with you?
Look around you.
Look at all these people.
Look at their faces.
Do you see how they' re suffering?
Their only hope is the resurrected Jesus.
I don' t care whether you' re Jesus or not.
The resurrected Jesus will save the world and that' s what matters.
Those are lies.
You can' t save the world by lying.
I created the truth out of what people needed and what they believed.
If I have to crucify you to save the world, then I' il crucify you.
I won' t let you.
I' il tell everyone the truth.
Go on.
Tell them now.
Who' s going to believe you?
You started all this, now you can' t stop it.
All those people who believe me will kill you.
That wouldn' t happen.
- How do you know?
You see, you don' t know how much people need God.
You don' t know how happy he can make them.
Happy to do anything.
He can make them happy to die and they' il die.
All for the sake of Christ.
Jesus Christ.
The Son of God.
The Messiah.
Not you.
Not for your sake.
You know, I' m glad I met you.
Because now I can forget all about you.
My Jesus is much more important and much more powerful.
Thank you.
It' s a good thing I met you.
Don' t ever leave me.
I' m happy here.
I remember when Mary and I planted these vines.
You know, this will all pass.
Why?
Are you leaving me?
We have to move on.
You' ve grown old.
You' ve done well.
We' ve both done well.
Get inside.
Get inside, fast!
Jerusalem is on fire!
The Romans are killing everyone.
We were sent here.
God told us you would show yourself to us.
He said you were dying.
Peter? ls that you?
I can' t tell.
What happened to you?
I got old.
You got old.
This one I know.
No matter how old you get, I know you, Nathaniel.
You were the best shepherd because you had no sheep.
Rabbi.
I missed you.
And you?
They cut you.
Your face.
Who are you?
John.
The Romans tortured me, cut my face.
I tried to tell them all about you.
Then I saw Jerusalem burn.
I even saw the Ark of the Covenant stolen from the temple.
They destroyed the temple, just like you said.
The Ark?
There' s someone else outside.
Be careful.
He' s still angry.
Judas.
Judas, come in.
Didn' t you hear me?
I missed you so much.
He just won' t say anything.
He' s been fighting in Jerusalem.
Look at his hands.
There' s still blood on them.
Judas, the Master is speaking to you.
Answer him.
Traitor!
Your place was on the cross.
That' s where God put you.
When death got too close, you got scared and you ran away...... and you hid yourself in the life of some man.
We did what we were supposed to do!
You didn' t!
You' re a coward!
Don' t you have any respect?
For him?
You don' t understand.
Understand?
You broke my heart.
Sometimes I curse the day I ever met you.
We held the world in our hands.
Remember what you told me?
You took me in your arms.
Do you remember?
And you begged me, "Betray me, betray me.
"I have to be crucified.
"I have to be resurrected so I can save the world.
"I am the lamb," you said.
"Death is the door.
"Judas, my brother, don' t be afraid.
Help me go through the door. "
I went and betrayed you.
And you...
... you....
What are you doing here?
What business do you have here with women, with children?
What' s good for man isn' t good for God.
Why weren' t you crucified?
Look at his wounds, Judas.
They' re bleeding.
You' re hurting him.
That' s enough.
He was going to be the New Covenant.
Now there' s no more lsrael.
No, you don' t understand.
The guardian angel.
God sent a guardian angel to save me.
What angel?
Look at her.
Satan.
I told you we would meet again.
If you die this way, you die like a man.
You turned against God, your Father.
There' s no sacrifice.
There' s no salvation.
There' s nothing you can do.
You lived this life.
It' s over now.
You just finish it and die.
Die like a man.
Father.
Will you listen to me?
Are you still there?
Will you listen to a selfish, unfaithful son?
I fought you when you called.
I resisted.
I thought I knew more.
I didn' t want to be your son.
Can you forgive me?
I didn' t fight hard enough.
Father...... give me your hand.
I want to bring salvation!
Father, take me back!
Make a feast!
Welcome me home!
I want to be your son!
I want to pay the price!
I want to be crucified and rise again!
I want to be the Messiah!
It is accomplished!
It is accomplished.
- Son of bitch!
20 '?
You' il love it.
Lift off!
Buckle up, I' il need third gear.
- No - Me neither.
- Or the Air Force!
He' s on form.
Don' t talk too soon.
They gonna bombard him with figs?
Listen up!
A white taxi clocked at 298 km/ h!
- Why d' you stop?
- I' m at top speed!
- Nitro?
- No, a friend of mine mixes it up.
Beautiful, isn' t it?
- Where now?
- Here' s fine.
Bravo!
Most clients, as soon as I stop, need a sick bag.
Thanks.
OK, I get it!
Thanks for your help.
Hey, don' t I know you?
Emilien' il be mad.
Taxi 3
What' s wrong?
Nothing...
A nightmare.
Go back to sleep.
- What you doing?
- Nothing.
I can' t sleep.
That gang again?
For 8 months, they' re all I' ve thought about.
8 months, I need to talk to you.
They just slip between our fingers.
- Did you hear me?
- Sure.
They dress up as Santa Claus!
You don' t believe in him?
They' re going to surprise us.
And I' m going to surprise you.
We need to talk before Xmas.
OK, that' s a deal.
- Going to work.
It' s 3 AM!
Good, less traffic.
No Xmas shoppers.
- No kidding.
- Better that way.
Lily!
You' re awake?
It' s 4 A. M and you' re doing repairs.
Not repairs.
It' s winter.
I' m adjusting her for when it' s cold.
Better install a radiator in my bed, so I don' t get cold either alone in my bed.
But me, it' s all year round.
- Don' t say that.
- Hands off!
Or I' il need the scrub- thingy.
What scrub- thingy?
That cleans pot and pans and, sometimes, numbskulls like me.
I' il be right up.
I don' t think so.
After you wash, you stink of turpentine.
And then it' s time to get up for work.
You' re on top form!
I got in 2 hours ago.
You were asleep so I came down here rather than watch TV.
Daniel!
We have no TV!
It' s the principle.
No TV!
No music!
No curtains!
No vases!
But, hey, you don' t send me flowers!
We have a fridge!
Full of lamps but it' s a fridge!
A garage!
- You got your period?
- Just the opposite!
I' m just sick of living in a garage.
A woman isn' t a Barbie with soft skin.
A woman moves, evolves and occasionally, likes a bit of comfort!
All because I' m working on the car!
What' s the deal with turps?
Lily, what are you doing?
Going home.
You prefer a boot camp?
It' s stupid!
We can' t...
You liked living here.
Now I don' t but you won' t listen.
You live for your car!
It' s too small for both of us.
It' s her or me!
Take your pick!
Hi, honeys, taking the kids out?
It' s humor!
Ajoke!
Fun in the workplace, see?
Merry Christmas to you!
You spend the night?
If it' s like the rings on a tree
It looks as if you been asleep maybe...
20 years!
Nobody has a sense of humor.
Fun off, will you!
I got some great Moroccan!
Dirt cheap.
Want a little?
From the high plateaus.
You' re missing out.
A little coke?
- Rachid!
- Have a nice day!
What the hell was that?
- And who' s this?
- That' s Bob Marley.
This isn' t some kind of squat!
What about the gang?
The Santa Claus Gang?
Ring any bells?
I go over and over it.
Nothing!
I feel empty, stupid, useless...
Sure you won' t have
- a Rachid pick- me- up?
- No!
How about... breakfast?
Get your strength up.
OK, breakfast then.
Jeez!
Someone' s hungry.
My mind' s on the gang!
Nightmares!
Tied up by dancing Santa Clauses.
- Stop, please
Santa Clauses everywhere.
In July, we' d easily spot them.
Except, in July, we didn' t spot them.
They must be planning a huge job!
One thing' s bugging me.
Who' d suspect Santa of anything?
Or too small.
It' s an ideal disguise for concealing...
A gun!
If Sir' s looking for the perfect blender Fruit, veg, purees
Everybody get down!
You' re under arrest!
- What happened?
- I got him!
After 8 months!
How d' you know he' s with the gang?
Does Santa often carry a gun on him?
- How did you know?
- The jerk dropped it.
The Chief will love him.
Hey, Chief, we got one of the He' s never in.
Sit down and don' t move, OK?
While we' re waiting, I' m Chief.
- Suit the desk, huh?
He' s not here!
Anyhow, promotion' s coming my way now.
OK, Daddy Claus how d' you get a police gun?
Who d' you steal it from?
Alain, he needs an address.
Marseille region?
If you need help, we have the yellow pages.
So what about the gun?
Shit!
He stole Gibert' s gun!
- No!
- I swear!
You know this is our Chief' s gun?
Maybe you' d like to explain?
Alain!
Emilien!
Chief!
Why the disguise, Chief?
I' m sorry, but Why not let us in on it?
It was infiltration.
- Sure, Chief.
Shit, they' re Alain' s cuffs.
- Hurry up, Emilien.
You' re Captain Gibert?
Not yet.
I' m not Gibert either.
- I mean I' d hate to be Gibert - Be right back, Chief!
You are Captain Gibert?
What can I do for you?
You are...
You' re Chinese?
Great, I love the Swiss.
World International, writing a piece on French police.
I asked to follow a major detective and you are the biggest
True enough I mean, 6' 3 "is fairly big
For a cop, it' s rare.
That' s impressive!
Sometimes, looking the mirror, I impress myself too
Could I stick close for a few days?
As long as you like, I mean...
As long as your piece takes.
Thanks.
Can we start?
With pleasure.
- Thank you, Qiu.
- It' s OK.
This is my camouflage gear.
It' s to infiltrate the Santa Claus gang.
- The cuffs?
- They' re not mine!
Any other questions?
Bad time?
No, it can' t get any worse.
At home, your mind' s on work.
So I thought I' d better catch you at work.
Not today, Petra, OK?
For 8 months, you' ve said that.
I' m in the shit!
Don' t push me under, will you!
What' s happened now?
I saw a Santa Claus.
I thought of the gang.
With or without a gun, it' s all you think about.
This was Santa with a gun!
So I neutralized him.
All by yourself?
Not the gang, then?
Gibert in disguise!
I could have died.
You should console me.
I don' t know, say something sweet, give me some good news.
I' m pregnant.
That' s good news, isn' t it?
But...
Since when?
Since 8 months ago.
How did that happen?
8 months ago?
I' d have noticed.
Your breasts are all...
So that' s why they' re...
Are you going to keep it?
It' s a bit late now, huh?
Why didn' t you say?
I put cauliflowers all over.
Look I wondered about that.
And photos from the scan.
They' re everywhere!
That' s my baby?
Mine.
If you want in, buck up.
- Is it normal?
- Knowing the Dad, you might wonder.
But, oddly enough, it' s normal.
So, if you' re pregnant and it' s normal and you' re keeping it I' m going to be a Daddy.
Very good.
They could use you in the police.
- You' d go far!
- Me, a Daddy?
Yes, and this kid will need a great Daddy.
Lily!
You' re not laughing now.
What use is a car without the woman you love?
Rapid Test?
What' s a Rapid Test?
2 lines?
What' s that mean?
- Hi!
- Hi!
- Do you have the box that comes in?
Isn' t it some kind of pregnancy test?
Don' t move.
Women like to give a little baby for Xmas.
That' s what I' m thinking.
I' il ask my daughter.
Angele!
She knows it all by heart.
It' s impressive.
Angele, what' s this?
Sorry, I try to be careful but I was drunk.
I told you to help yourself to condoms.
- There were none his size!
- Whose?
- You don' t know his name?
I forgot their names.
Merry Christmas!
This is serious.
I tried a solo commando mission only to be thwarted by Emilien.
Never mind.
Tomorrow!
Starting today!
You can quote me.
- Your lace is undone.
- Wonderful.
- Indeed.
Where was I?
- This is serious.
Extra clean!
Last summer I worked with the NYPD.
I picked up some jargon.
Isn' t that wild?
So, hear this, men!
I want the Santa Claus Gang behind bars before Christmas.
So, no days off, medical certificates or letters from your parents.
On top of that, Ms. Qiu a journalist with World International, will accompany us.
Let' s give her a good image of our police force.
Consult!
Act!
I have named this Operation Snow White.
Blanche Neige in French.
- Guess who are the dwarves.
- Wonderful.
From now on, everybody' s on deck 24/ 7!
- Questions?
- Me!
- What' s the gift?
- What gift?
Sweet.
Is it my birthday?
- What month?
- July.
- It' s for Xmas then.
- Never mind.
- Who' s it from?
- They know your hobbies.
There' s a little button on the top.
Wonderful!
Hi, lawmen!
This is Santa!
Time anybody?
- 11: 55, Chief.
- Red Alert!
How can you work with these idiots?
Don' t quote me, Ms. Qiu.
It' s very French.
Spread out and wait.
Last time, they sped away.
Now, we' il surprise them.
They told us to be here!
Present and ready to rumble!
A criminal who warns the police?
That' s stupid!
They' re not stupid!
There' s a first time for everything.
- Unless - Unless what?
They' re sure to escape.
Let them try.
They won' t go 10 meters.
Trust me!
- Captin!
- What' s up?
What the heck is that?
It' s horrible!
- You OK, Chief?
- I' m just dandy.
Why are you still here?
- How do we stop that?
Use your imagination!
Requisition a car!
Why didn' t he stop?
Black and a cop?
No chance!
Even so, he could' ve slowed down.
I' m used to it.
- Let' s requisition our cars!
- Right.
To the cars!
The anti- theft system is totally unique based on the Atlas system used by the police.
Press here and it alerts the nearest police unit.
Very efficient.
Holy Fuck!
My car!
I' il get out.
Less weight.
Your 50 pounds won' t make much difference.
As for you The old port of Marseille and its famous Canebiere from "canabe", the hemp they used for the ropes.
It was King Louis XlV in 1661 who...
- I am!
The Canebiere founded in 1661...
Not keep up with me, knucklehead!
With the off- roader!
D' you see, Qiu?
They recruit any old how.
This lad would make a good lifeguard.
He doesn' t have a license?
- No way!
Calm!
He just has to follow the car ahead.
Any lifeguard can handle that.
- What now?
- Just follow, kid.
That thing guzzles so much gas, he' il run out before us.
- In 5 ', he' s ours!
- We won' t last 5 '.
Shouldn' t we stop to say sorry?
All in good time.
First, the chase!
- Seek and destroy!
- Funny one.
Should I stop?
- What for?
- The pool!
Good thinking.
Gee, that was close.
Hey!
- Nowhere near 5 '!
Perfect seal.
Is it always like this?
Most times we get cars that leak!
- I can' t swim.
Daniel!
You look terrible.
Justjoking...
Have fun while you' re young.
Seen my driver?
He' s late.
One block up.
He won' t be long.
Perfect!
- Is Lily in?
- Of course.
Sorry.
Didn' t see you there.
Don' t worry, I' m used to it.
Look who it is!
- Can we talk a minute?
- I' m going out.
To the doctor' s.
- Give me a ride, Dad?
- Of course.
Where' s my car?
Can I give you both a ride?
Affirmative!
Teach him to be late!
C' mon, all aboard!
Boulevard Cassini, driver!
Yes, Ma' am.
Daniel offered us a ride.
See you at barracks.
- Taking it easy?
- You think?
The roads are wild and full of potholes, terrible And a little calm does you good.
Indeed but I don' t want to be late.
What' s wrong?
- It hurts!
- Where does it hurt?
- My belly.
- That' s awful!
- What do we do, general?
- How do I know?
Are you really in pain?
- I' m better now.
It' s gone.
- Sure?
Yes, it' s gone...
It' s gone...
It' s Xmas, the gifts, all that...
It gets to me.
Yes, so I see.
What' s that behind your ear?
Nothing!
It takes your blood pressure.
2 lines, you' re not OK.
That' s why I' m taking it easy.
Thanks for the ride Most agreeable.
See you tonight, honey.
I' il ask the doctor but I' d say you' ve no hope.
I hate to intrude but I' m going to be late.
Lift off!
Enter.
Are you OK?
Couldn' t be better.
We' re betrayed by our own equipment.
How can we work?
We need funds.
Remember?
Glug- glug...
You see!
Not to mention comfortable shoes.
These ones are killing me!
What prankster did that?
It' s not funny.
It' s not funny at all.
You' re too tense.
It' s that gang.
The Santa Claus Gang!
Forget about them and let me take care of you.
You know how that works?
A little.
We got them last week.
Let yourself go, Captain.
- You think so?
- I' m sure of it.
I can' t see.
Is that normal?
Perfectly normal.
Relax.
That feels good.
It' s all draining away.
That' s exactly it.
You' il see.
Y' know, I' m scared I' il nod off.
I' il wake you.
Excellent!
- You know where you are?
- No, where?
Police HQ!
- No way!
Looks like a garage.
- Comedian, huh?
- At ease.
Thanks, Daniel.
See you tonight.
My savior!
Can you drop me off?
'Scuse me...
- Can I go?
- I suppose so.
Can you keep an eye on the space?
I' il be back.
- Easy, I' m not late.
- Yes, boss.
- You' il never guess.
- Neither will you.
Take a guess.
It' s unbelievable.
- You got promotion?
- No, it' s personal.
- Marriage?
- I don' t believe it.
- You' d better.
It' s wonderful!
- Lily' s pregnant too.
- No way!
That' s wonderful.
Would you believe that!
Friends for so long and now having a kid together.
- Separately - Yeah, separately, sure.
- 8!
- You didn' t say!
You' re first to know.
Ahead of my Mom.
- And you?
- 2 lines.
2 lines?
Wow, that' s cool.
Yeah, it' s cool.
Visitors.
What' s this?
No kidding, it energizes.
The lesson is over.
See you later, Captain.
Thank you, Qiu.
What can I do for you?
I didn' t even notice.
- How dumb can you be?
But why cauliflowers?
How do I know?
Nada!
- I am such a klutz.
- That' s going too far.
- If you were, she' d bail.
- You think?
Petra' s anything but a masochist.
That' s good to hear.
- Yeah but we' re still in shit.
- Whaddya mean?
You' re always chasing thieves and I' m a car freak.
And a kid takes up a lot of space.
We have to change our ways.
Right!
See him walk take him to school
- It' s fingers in sockets first.
Sure Jeez, you don' t think how much work it is.
Shit!
Rachid give it to you?
- You know Rachid?
Santa on a scooter Is that normal?
Usually he' s on a sleigh.
Discreet but edgy that' s not normal.
You just said we had to work less to look after our women and future progeny No chase, OK?
- At your service!
Got anything on scooter 75 BN 13?
- Stolen 2 weeks ago.
- Perseverance always pays.
Petra' il be pleased.
We locate their hideout and I pass it on.
Even deeper in it.
Our only lead and I lose him!
Every problem has a solution.
What the hell?
What are you doing?
- Got a better way to tail a scooter?
- Act cool, we' il be fine.
- Cool, OK
You saw where he went.
Now call your Chief.
I messed up once.
Not again.
I have to check my sources.
Santa on a stolen scooter in a warehouse?
- What more d' you want?
- I can' t screw up.
Proof?
Or d' you wanna see their guns work?
No, that' s fine.
Best find out how many there are.
Come with me.
Don' t you know when to stop?
You said you' d call in.
He' il want to know how many.
And is this their HQ or a drop?
It' il take 5 minutes.
I don' t see this working.
It' s mind over matter.
I know.
That' s why I' m worried.
If I' m hurt, call Gibert.
Wanna hear?
- He' s excellent.
Recommended by Marie- Sophie who had 4 kids in 4 years.
- That' il be hard to beat.
- Living apart, yeah.
Lily, I' m trying but you have to be there to see it.
Can you speak up?
The Santas have got Emilien.
Looks like they' re about to
Lily, Lily
Guess.
I' ve been trained to resist torture.
- I' il never talk.
- We don' t need you to.
We know everything.
Anyhow, torture' s outdated.
That' s the most fearsome of weapons.
What' s a hunk like you doing in the police?
Hey, that' s off limits.
You do seem open to a little persuasion.
It' s off.
Can I turn it on?
It' s human rights abuse!
This is inhumane.
The end justifies the means!
- Can' t take your call, I' m busy.
- Give your ID, we' il be in touch.
You must be on a mission.
I' m very proud of you and your devotion to your work.
You put everything into it.
Think of yourself a little.
Relax and enjoy life' s pleasures.
And maybe make some time for me too.
You again?
Have you seen Emilien?
- He' s been kidnapped!
- What on earth for?
By a group of armed Santa Clauses.
- It' s the Santa Claus Gang!
- You don' t say.
- He went in alone?
- Not quite.
He will be avenged.
To the cars!
Can you stick close by?
I' ve a sinking feeling about this.
That' s cheery.
Captin!
What good timing!
We' re going to catch the Santas in the act!
In the sack with them!
- Can I come?
Captain...
Please!
OK, it' s not far.
Follow us, huh?
Into position.
So, this is Xmas.
I' il turn on their lights no messing.
- How did you find them?
- My private grapevine.
My brother is in sanitation.
He flunked his police exams.
That happened to all my pals too.
Nobody asked you.
Anyway, he called me about work in the sewers.
A tunnel!
Between bank and store.
So they can spend the cash right away.
They rob the bank on Sunday and walk out via the store.
I get it.
As Santas, nobody notices.
The Santa disguise was to help them rob the richest bank in Marseille.
Of course!
You' re a genius!
- Can I make a call?
- Go ahead.
That' s funny.
Emilien has the same.
Hello!
Activate plan B.
- I got it!
Chinese!
- Chief!
Movement inside.
- Ready!
See the 4- wheel monster and destroy!
I hear you.
Xmas is over!
Gibert means business.
Where' s the big monster?
Catch them!
Alive even!
Requisitioned!
Alain, follow me!
We have a wonderful view over the port.
- It' s quiet in winter?
Stop!
- Chief, wait for me!
- In the name of the law!
Yes, 1 bike for 2 officers is not good.
Not good at all.
Tell the chopper we' re on schedule.
I' il miss you, sweet little Emilien.
- But you won' t suffer.
- Great.
That' s my Swiss side.
When the mechanism triggers the ball will swing down on its cable with you in the front row.
How long before it triggers?
- You have exactly 5 minutes.
- Shit!
Make the most of it to purify your soul.
You must cleanse your mind and review your life before meeting the Eternal.
5 'to cleanse my mind?
You have to prioritize.
I took your cell phone as a souvenir.
I' m very sentimental.
That' s my Chinese side.
Cleanse my mind?
Sure.
What we need is a miracle.
Even a tiny one.
Not the ball!
Not the taxi!
It' s terrible.
We must find her.
Not to mention all the loot!
If China girl answers it, I' m for it.
Sure.
I' d have done the same for you.
So I' d die run over by a cop car.
Hey, my driving' s getting better.
Not your manners.
Say thank you.
If we let the gang get away, my life' s worthless.
We' il find your gang!
Now, say thank you.
How' il we find them?
We' ve no leads, no clues!
- Is that good enough?
- What?
Sorry, pal.
My nerves are giving out.
I can' t take it.
China girl...
She tortured me for hours.
- She tortured you?
- How?
You can' t guess...
I can' t talk about it.
It still hurts...
I understand.
Don' t worry.
We' il find her!
Come on!
Did she mention anything?
Just a chopper that' s waiting somewhere.
- And she had fur boots on.
- Fur boots?
- Notice anything?
- No!
- Yeah!
Melted snow?
If it' s still here, it came from high up and nearby.
But why the mountains?
Switzerland!
Of course!
She' s half- Swiss It' s home field.
They drive up and ski across blending in with the tourists...
All the way to their chopper.
That' s wonderful!
Tignes- Val d' Isere!
- See anything?
Patrol 1:
Nothing to report.
- So where to for the vacation?
- We' il head for the slopes.
Now, let' s hope we were right and we spot their car.
You look right, I' il look left.
You don' t know left from right?
Right for you?
- I took it as facing you.
But I thought you meant facing you.
- What?
- The car!
- Try a shortcut.
- First right.
- You know Tignes?
Trust my instinct.
I prefer to trust mine.
I' il take a right.
Watch out!
That was close!
- Where are we?
- Look for a sign.
What' s with all these cars?
They must be from the ski school.
What' s that sign say?
Is that good?
Shit!
That' s screwed it.
Look at the tracks.
A snowmobile!
We' il never catch them.
It' s never over.
This isn' t about speed it' s about snow.
Nothing' s impossible.
You like my winter collection?
Yeah, not bad.
- You tried it out?
- Not yet.
- I' d say it works.
- I' d say so.
- But where' d they go?
Yeah, I see.
Can the taxi do a chopper too?
I' d better warn the general then.
Very good idea.
Lend me your cell phone?
Transfer the cash.
We must be gone before sunset.
- You think they' re inside?
Hello!
We' il be there in 10 '.
You sure this is a good idea?
I know the mountains.
But this is high up.
- I' m from Grenoble.
Everybody out!
- I wouldn' t.
He just won' t be told.
See?
No need to muck up my seats!
- It' s snow!
Snow leaves marks!
- I' il clean your damn car!
- What with?
- I said I' il clean it.
Give me a break!
C' mon, clear out!
- You ski?
Follow me!
This is a forest!
- Scare you?
- The car scares me.
What are you doing?
We' ve spotted the chopper.
Get ready!
Are you sure...?
I checked all my gear.
I' il be fine.
Let' s go, guys!
What happened?
Wait for me!
The strap must be too short.
Obviously it is.
- You' re cutting it?
- Too right.
- Are we lost?
- If we follow the flags, we' il be OK.
First at Kitzbuhel, now here at Val d' Isere he' s crushed the competition.
He' s smashed the intermediate times.
He seems certain to be world champion.
Victory is his for the taking...
Then again A taxi wins by a short head.
It' s too quiet.
Not where you' re going?
Take her away!
You' re not too bitter about being tortured for hours.
- Sure.
He was supposed to be here.
An incoming Gibert!
Chief!
Watch where you land!
No worries, Emilien.
It' s only snow.
That has to be cold!
Hey!
My waters have broken!
You' re giving birth?
Now?
- Not yet but hurry up!
- I' il be right there!
Chief, Petra' s in labor!
Ajob for me, I guess.
Sweetheart!
I' m here!
Everything' il be fine!
Don' t faint!
It' s not a good time.
I' il be fine.
Everything' il be fine
Not now!
Be strong.
Watch the screen for contractions.
Contractions?
On screen?
That one!
Yeah, that one!
- Where?
- Not you!
Her!
Push with the contractions!
Push now, sweetheart!
Breathe...
She has to breathe - Not me
- Push off!
- I see its head!
- Its head?
- Once more!
- Again, darling!
- Push off!
Push off!
Good!
Now relax.
It' s a beautiful boy.
I' m a Daddy!
You want to cut the cord?
- What you doing?
- Practicing.
- Why?
You pregnant?
- No, the woman I love is.
I want to be ready when it' s my turn.
I' m very lucky.
- And I made promises.
- Such as?
To spend more time with her to be a great Dad
- The fridge?
- Empty!
And to be a great husband if she' il marry me.
- She believed you?
- No way.
Sincerity' s not the problem.
Finding the time is.
The time to work at it.
Lily!
I' m from an old- fashioned family y' know.
Do me the honor of being my wife.
- Depends.
- On what?
How you make love.
You have 1 hour to convince me.
- We' il see.
INTENSlVE CARE
(Man) 'They will say that I have shed innocent blood.
'What' s blood for if not for shedding?
'I' il split you from your groin to your gullet.
'I came for you.'
(Woman) This is the scariest story I' ve ever heard and it' s totally true.
'It happened a few years ago near Moses lake in lndiana.
'Clara was baby- sitting for the Johnsons
'and Billy pulls up on his motorcycle.
'She wasn' t even going out with Billy.
'She was going out with Michael for about six months
'and Michael was... he was just so nice.
'that she' s going to give Billy what she never gave to Michael.'
Have you ever heard of Candyman?
His right hand is sawn off.
He has a hook jammed in the bloody stump and if you look in the mirror and you say his name five times he' il appear behind you, breathing down your neck.
You want to try it?
'So Billy began.
'He looked in the mirror, and he said...'
Candyman...
Candyman...
Candyman...
Candyman...
No one ever got past four.
Not here.
I have a surprise for you.
'She looked in the mirror
'but she said his name the last time.'
Candyman.
'She turned out the lights...'
(Clara screaming)... and what he saw turned his hair white from shock.
Killed her.
Split her open with his hook and then killed the baby too.
And Billy got away but soon after, he went crazy.
My... my roommate' s boyfriend knows him.
So when did you first hear this story?
Sick, huh?
The baby- sitter just roasted the kid like it was a turkey or something.
So, what' s the deal?
You guys doing a page on serial killers?
Something like that.
Well, that' s it.
We' re done.
- No problem.
See you.
(lmitates young man) See you.
Seems like they' re getting younger every day.
(Man) Does anybody remember the craze for the pet baby alligators?
(Woman) When they got too large to keep people flushed them down the toilet.
They live in the sewers.
Some or them are 30 feet long.
- Where did this happen?
- In Miami.
They went blind and albino from living in the dark.
(Audience laughs) (Boy) It wasn' t Miami.
It was New York.
I read it in the paper.
(Audience laughs)
Why would Danny and Diane both be suffering from the same delusion in two cities over 1, 000 miles apart?
Let' s face it, folks.
There are no alligators in the sewers.
No, it' s... it' s round the campfire.
It' s bedtime stories.
See, these stories are... modern oral folklore.
(Bell ringing)
That' s lunch.
- The dashing professor.
- The lovely wife.
Helen, you know everybody?
Crème de la crème...
- Hi.
So, keep up the good work.
Bye.
See ya.
So, you want to tell me about this girl?
What' s her name?
Stacey.
She could barely look me in the eyes, Trevor and she was blushing.
Well, I guess it' s because she' s madly in love with me.
All those bursting adolescent hormones.
- You don' t really think...
- No, of course not.
I should hope not.
So, what' s the matter?
Trevor, you promised you wouldn' t do the urban legends lecture until next semester.
Why did you have to ruin it?
I love you dearly but I can' t hold up their education while the two of you complete your thesis.
I have a curriculum to follow here.
Yes, I know.
Well... so don' t be mad at me.
'he' il appear behind you, breathing down your neck.'
Oh, sure.
Don' t mind me.
'So Billy began.
'He looked in the mirror
'and he said, "Candyman, Candyman, Candyman..."'
Candyman, huh?
Have you heard of him?
- You doing a study on him?
- Yes, I am.
What have you heard?
Everybody scared of him once it get dark.
He live over at Cabrini.
My friend told me about him.
Cabrini Green?
Yeah, in the Projects.
I live on the South Side so I don' t know much about it.
But my friend know all about it.
Her cousin live at Cabrini.
They say he killed a lady.
Can I talk to your friend?
Sure.
Kitty?
- Yeah, what do you want?
- Lady down here want to talk to you.
She coming.
I' m Helen Lyle.
Pleased to meet you.
Henrietta Mosely.
And this is Kitty Culver.
Tell her what you told me about the Candyman.
All I know is there was some lady in a tub, and she heard a noise.
Do you remember her name?
Her name was Ruthie Jean.
She heard banging and smashing like somebody was making a hole in the wall.
So Ruthie called 91 1.
She said, "Somebody is coming through the wall."
And they didn' t believe her.
They thought the lady was crazy, right?
So she called 91 1 again and they still didn' t believe her.
When they finally got there, she was dead.
Was she shot?
No.
Schhht!
(Henrietta) It' s true.
Yeah, I read it in the papers.
(Henrietta) Candyman killed her.
I don' t know nothing about that.
(Bernadette) Helen, this is sick.
This isn' t one of your fairy tales.
The woman got killed here.
That' s not the half of it.
That' s Cabrini Green not that you' d recognise it today.
I won' t even drive past there.
- A kid got shot there the other day.
- Everyday.
OK, now look carefully at this picture and then this one.
You spot it?
No.
That' s not Cabrini Green.
That' s this building, Lincoln village.
My apartment was built as a housing project.
Now take a look at this.
Once finished the city realised there was no barrier between here and the Gold Coast.
Unlike over there where the highway and the el train keep the ghetto cut off.
So they made some minor alterations.
They covered the cinder block in plaster and sold the lot off as condos.
How much did you pay for this place?
Don' t ask.
Now, wait till you see this.
Here' s the proof.
See?
There' s no wall there.
There' s only a medicine chest separating us from the other apartment.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
There could be somebody on the toilet.
- No, the apartment is vacant.
OK, now take a look.
(Bernadette) That is amazing.
- There' s somebody there.
There' s nobody there.
Psych.
That' s not funny.
- You didn' t scare me at all.
You don' t believe all that nonsense, do you?
Do you?
No.
All right.
(Both) Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman...... Candyman.
Oh, you chicken!
Come on.
- (Helen) I did it.
Trevor?
Oh, Trevor!
Who were you expecting?
What time is it?
It' s late and I' m smashed.
Sorry I scared you.
What' s with the arsenal, Bernadette?
We' re only going eight blocks.
You' re the one who got us dressed up like cops.
I just said dress conservatively.
We look like cops.
Why are you trying to scare me?
I' m not trying to scare you.
I just want you to think.
The gangs hold this neighbourhood hostage.
OK, let' s just turn around then.
Let' s just go back and we can write a boring thesis regurgitating the usual crap on urban legend.
We' ve got a real shot here, Bernadette.
An entire community starts attributing the daily horrors of their lives to a mythical figure.
Now, if Trevor and Archie were in on this do you think they' d chicken out?
In a second.
Exactly.
All right.
- You want to wait here for me?
- No.
Well, let' s go.
(Helen) And lock the car.
Which way you going?
Just going inside.
Who you looking for?
Sure you not the police?
Look like five- oh to me.
Ask blondie where she going.
Who you going to see?
Let' s take the stairs.
Come on.
Hands up, people!
Five- oh coming up the back door.
It' s OK they think we' re cops.
They' re not going to follow us.
Hang on.
Look at this.
This is great.
(Helen) "... to the sweet."
Hurry up, Helen.
Let me just get the door.
Sorry.
Jesus, Helen.
- Don' t go in there.
Come on.
Come on.
Jesus, it stinks.
See, I was right.
The layout is identical which means the bathroom is over there.
- Helen...
- What' s the problem?
A woman died in there.
Leave it.
There' s nothing to see.
Wait a minute.
This is where he crawled through, right?
Well, we found it.
Let' s go.
Wait a second.
OK, hang onto this.
What?
I' m just going to go through and when I get back, we' re out of here.
You' ve got to be kidding.
It' s just a derelict apartment.
What if somebody' s packing drugs in there?
You just going to apologise and give them your card?
All right, let' s listen.
(Helen) There' s nobody in there.
OK, but hurry up.
Be careful.
Give me the camera.
You' ve got five minutes.
OK, five.
Dammit.
Bernadette...
I ran out of film.
I' ve got to back.
- No way.
- You can' t believe...
No way, Helen.
What you all doing in there?
We' re just leaving.
You here for the sweep?
We' re not cops.
We' re from the university.
Well, you don' t belong here, lady... going through people' s apartments and things.
I' m Helen Lyle and this is Bernadette Walsh.
We' re doing a thesis and were wondering if we could talk to you for a few minutes.
Here, this is my card.
My baby.
Come on, let' s go.
You know, whites don' t never come here except to cause us a problem.
Believe me that' s not what we want to do.
So you say you' re doing a study?
What you gonna say?
That we bad?
We steal?
We gang- bang?
We all on drugs, right?
We ain' t all like them assholes downstairs, you know?
I just want to raise my child good.
He' s a beautiful little boy.
And he' s all I got.
- What' s his name?
- Anthony.
I' m Anne- Marie.
Anne- Marie McCoy.
We' il just get out of your way.
It' s OK.
I mean, I don' t mean to be rude, and it' s... you know, it' s just... the white folks that come around here ain' t too hand- shaking with us, you know?
- Hey, what you doing?
- Let me help you.
You making a mess here?
Thanks.
You got kids?
No, but I' d love one.
Got my eye on this one big time.
They' re not going to get him.
You want to know about Ruthie Jean?
They all been here, you know.
Newspapers, cops, case workers...
They all want to know.
I heard her screaming.
I heard right through the walls.
I dialled 91 1.
Nobody came.
Nobody came.
Everybody scared.
He could come right through these walls, you know?
I' m scared.
Scared for my child.
They ain' t never gonna catch him.
- Who?
- Candyman.
- I am being nice.
So, how are the two most beautiful graduate students getting along?
Trevor tells me you' ve been dabbling in my favourite subject.
I can' t wait to review your data.
I can fit you in tomorrow morning.
We' re not ready yet.
That' s precisely the moment in which I can be of greatest assistance before you disappear down a path to academic Bolivia.
(Trevor) I' ve been there.
Actually, Purcell, we' re about to bury you.
- What?
We' il have something in a week or so.
It' s just that we only went to Cabrini today...
Cabrini Green?
Candyman country.
Well, if you' re after the hook man, Helen, you must read the paper I wrote about him ten years ago.
You do know the story, don' t you?
Then how are you going to bury me?
The legend first appeared in 1 890.
Candyman was the son of a slave.
His father had amassed a considerable fortune from designing a device for the mass producing of shoes after the civil war.
Candyman had been sent to all the best schools and had grown up in polite society.
He had a prodigious talent as an artist and was much sought after when it came to the documenting of one' s wealth and position in society in a portrait.
Well, it was in this latter capacity that he was commissioned by a wealthy landowner to capture his daughter' s virginal beauty.
Well, of course, they fell deeply in love and she became pregnant.
Poor Candyman.
Her father executed a terrible revenge.
He paid a pack of brutal hooligans to do the deed.
They chased Candyman through the town to Cabrini Green where they proceeded to saw off his right hand with a rusty blade.
No one came to his aid.
But this was just the beginning of his ordeal.
Nearby there was an apiary.
Dozens of hives, filled with hungry bees.
They smashed the hives and stole the honeycomb and smeared it over his prone, naked body.
Candyman was stung to death by the bees.
They burned his body on a giant pyre then scattered his ashes over Cabrini Green.
Hello.
Anne- Marie ain' t in.
Are you sure?
She said you' d be back.
What' s your name?
Jake.
Listen, Jake, maybe you can help me out.
I wanted to find out about that woman who got killed.
Do you know anything about that?
Her name was Ruthie Jean.
I don' t know nothing.
Did anybody else talk about it?
You know, it' s OK to talk to me, Jake... because I' m not a cop so nobody' s going to get in trouble.
I can' t say nothing or Candyman will get me.
Candyman?
You scared of him?
I ain' t scared of nobody but you' re crazy walking here on your own.
It ain' t safe around here.
Yeah, I know.
But I don' t scare too easy either, Jake.
You know, you don' t have to tell me.
You could just show me.
I' il make you a promise.
It will be our secret.
Unless you' re too scared.
Somebody building a bonfire?
Yeah, for the party.
In there.
Candyman' s in there?
My friend Charlie say so.
A boy got killed there.
- Who was he?
- Ain' t sure.
Charlie tell me he was weird.
He was crazy?
No, a retard.
His mom was in the store... and the boy, he need to go, you know, to the bathroom.
His mom was taking her time choosing this, looking at that so the boy start moaning.
His mom get mad at him send him across the street.
His mom is at the checkout.
She hears her boy screaming.
(Screaming) Mommy!
There' s a big tough guy.
He runs over to check it out.
He come out of there shaking and crying.
He only been in there five seconds.
Come out of there and his hair turned white.
I mean, it turned white just like that.
Was the boy murdered?
Worse.
He' s lying on the floor in a pool of blood holding himself.
They found it floating in the toilet.
Can' t fix that.
Better off dead.
Did Candyman do this?
Listen, you wait here for me, OK?
OK.
Hello?
Candyman.
I' m done here.
I' il just get out of your way.
Listen, I don' t want to interfere with your business.
I' m not a cop.
I' m from the University of illinois.
I' il just get out of your way.
Come on!
Let me go!
You' re not being very smart.
My colleagues know where I am and they' re expecting me back.
Now let me go!
I hear you looking for Candyman, bitch.
Well, you found him.
We hear you' re looking for Candyman, bitch.
Step back.
We hear you' re looking for Candyman, bitch.
Step back.
We hear you' re looking for Candyman, bitch.
Step back.
Take 'em out.
It' s number five.
Good work.
How d' you catch him?
We swept the place.
We start from the top floor and work our way down.
That way you can flush 'em all out.
Whole of Cabrini is locked down now.
You' re very lucky to be alive, Ms Lyle.
Did he kill Ruthie Jean?
No question.
Killed that poor kid as well.
He ran the overlords.
We knew everything about him.
Only reason why we didn' t bring him in before because we couldn' t find anyone to testify.
We can' t protect them down at Cabrini Green and they knew that.
What about the little boy... Jake?
We don' t need him.
We have you.
Hey, Jake.
I just wanted to thank you for saving my life.
I wanna go home.
We' il get you out of here.
You did good.
You said it was our secret.
You lied!
It still is, Jake.
You won' t have to go to court.
Candyman will get me.
Candyman isn' t real.
He' s just a story.
You know, like Dracula or... or Frankenstein.
A bad man took his name so he could scare us.
But now he' s locked up everything' s going to be OK.
Candyman ain' t real?
No.
Hey there!
Slow down.
Look, see?
It' s much better today.
Yeah, it looks great.
Come sit down.
You haven' t eaten already?
No, of course not.
OK, good.
(Bernadette) Hey!
Welcome back.
Thanks.
Let me see.
I' m so glad you' re OK.
But you know what bugs me about the whole thing?
Two people get brutally murdered and the cops do nothing.
A white woman gets attacked and they lock the place down.
This was a bad guy.
That' s what matters.
I' ve got a surprise for you.
What?
You' re not going to believe it.
The pictures.
My friend in the photography department managed to save most of them.
The camera was smashed.
I' ve been talking to some publishers and there' s a lot of interest since you made the local section.
We' re going to be published.
I' il come over tomorrow at 9: 00.
- We' il get started?
- Yeah.
(Deep, resonating voice) Helen...
Yes?
Helen...
Who is that?
Who is that?
I came for you.
Do I know you?
No... no... but you doubted me.
I have to go.
No need to leave yet.
But I' m late.
You were not content with the stories so I was obliged to come.
Be my victim.
Be my victim.
I am the writing on the wall the whisper in the classroom.
Without these things I am nothing so now I must shed innocent blood.
Come with me.
Anthony!
Anthony!
Anne- Marie?
You!
You did it!
You murdered my baby!
You murderer!
Please, stop!
Now stop!
Stop!
Police!
Open up!
All right, hold it right there!
Now!
Look out!
Remove your sweater.
Drop it and slide it over to me.
Take off your brassiere.
Can I please take a shower?
Drop it, slide it over to me.
Lift up your arms.
Lift your left breast.
Your right.
Remove your underwear.
Can I please speak with detective Valento?
Remove your underwear.
Frank.
Ms Lyle, you' re under arrest.
Do you understand?
Please let me explain.
Do you understand?
You have the right to remain silent.
Do you understand?
This is crazy.
I was attacked.
Respond to the question.
I understand.
Anne- Marie McCoy returned to her apartment.
She discovered her dog with its head cut off.
She cried for assistance at which point you attacked her with a meat cleaver.
You were still in possession of this weapon when the arresting officers came to her aid.
(O' Malley) Where' s the baby?
You' re sick.
(Frank) Before I ask any further questions would you like to have counsel?
Yes or no?
I... l' d like to make a phone call.
(Phone continues ringing) (Trevor) I' m sorry, we can' t take your call.
Please leave a message after the tone.
Trevor, are you there?
Pick up.
It' s an emergency, Trevor.
Pick up the phone.
I' ve been arrested.
I' m at the 1 8th district.
Can you... can you please come pick me up?
That' s it.
Do you know what time it is?
3: 00 am.
There' s got to be another way out.
Don' t say anything.
(Trevor) OK.
(Attorney) All right.
You' il be fine.
(Reporters shouting)
Just keep your head down.
All right, people, back off, back off!
We have no comment.
Nothing to say.
Do you know the baby' s whereabouts?
My client has not been charged with a thing!
(Woman) lnformation has indicated that baby Anthony was abducted and may still be alive.
The blood may have come from the dog.
A suspect was released this morning after questioning and I guess we' il just have to follow this one...
Well, at least they didn' t mention your name.
That' s good.
Now, they haven' t charged you, because they think they' il find the body which means, I' m afraid they' re shooting for murder one, but I don' t think they have a chance.
Do you think I did it?
Nobody believes that.
But it' s crossed your mind?
Is there anything, any detail, however small, that you can recall, that would help us substantiate your version of events?
I... l blacked out.
I mean, I don' t know what happened.
I just woke up in that place and there was blood everywhere.
Can I get you anything?
Are you sure?
I was supposed to go to the campus and pick up some work.
I' m concerned about leaving you alone though.
I' il only be about 20 minutes.
Trevor...
Where were you last night?
I was fast asleep.
I thought you were with Bernadette.
Look, honey...
I' m going to stand by you.
We' re going to get through this OK?
I' il be right back.
Believe in me.
Be my victim.
Do you believe in me?
Keep away from me.
I have the child.
Allow me to take you or he will die in your place.
Your disbelief destroyed the faith of my congregation.
Without them, I am nothing.
So I was obliged to come.
And now I must kill you.
Your death will be a tale to frighten children, to make lovers cling closer in their rapture.
Come with me and be immortal.
Helen?
Bernadette...
Bernadette, go.
Helen?
Helen, honey.
It' s Bernadette.
He' s here.
Bernadette, go!
Helen!
Helen?
Get out!
Trevor...
Trevor, he' s here.
He' s...... here.
Trevor...
Trevor...
Trevor!
Take her outside.
Hold me, Trevor, please?
(Candyman) 'Why do you want to live?
'you would not beg to live.
'I am rumour.
'It is a blessed condition, believe me.
'To be whispered about at street corners,
'but not to have to be.
'Do you understand?'
(Helen) 'Please, God,
'don' t let him kill the baby.'
Trevor!
Where are you going?
No, you can' t leave me here.
I can' t defend myself!
What do the good know except what the bad teach them by their excesses?
Murderer.
Allow me at least a kiss.
(Crying)
Murderer!
Help!
Listen, he' s under the bed!
Bring me 1, 000 mils!
Listen, he' s here.
He' s under the bed!
No, don' t.
Good morning.
I' d like to speak to my husband.
So would l.
Here we go.
What time is it?
Where are we going?
We' re going to Disneyland.
Clyde, open it up.
Clyde, open it up.
What the hell you all doing back there, huh?
A little reading?
Break.
Dr Burke?
Yes?
Miss Lyle, I' m Dr Burke.
I' d like to speak to my husband.
I' m sure we can arrange a visit.
A visit?
Have I been committed?
Do you really think these restraints are necessary?
Helen, this... is a writ of detention from the state attorney' s office.
Now, for the past month...
- Month?
- Yes.... we have been stabilizing you on a heavy dosage of Thorazine.
You probably remember very little or nothing.
Get me my attorney.
I' m working for your defence.
We have to assess your ability to stand trial.
Helen, you' ve been charged with first- degree murder.
Why don' t you tell me what happened in your apartment?
The night you were admitted did the killer appear to you?
'Murderer!
'Murderer!
'Help me!
'He' s here!
'He' s under the bed!
I don' t understand.
Please!
'He' s here!
Help me!
That' s not possible.
Bernadette...
I' m not capable of that.
I know one thing...... that no part of me, no matter how hidden is capable of that.
I can prove it.
How?
I can call him.
Candyman...
Candyman...
Candyman...
Candyman...
... Candyman.
You' re mine now.
Tonight our congregation shall witness a new... miracle.
Please be home, Trevor.
Please be home.
Get out of my home.
(Agitated) Trevor!
What' s the matter, sweetie pie?
What are you doing here?
I live here, remember?
Call the hospital.
Don' t touch the phone.
What' s the matter, Trevor?
Scared of something?
I hate the color scheme.
What were you going to do?
Wait till I got out before you told me?!
But you knew I was never coming out, didn' t you?
I think we should call the hospital.
OK.
(Dial tone)
Go on.
Is that what you want to do?
Call them.
I' m not a murderer.
Trevor, you were all I had left.
It' s over.
(Candyman) They will all abandon you.
All you have left is my desire for you.
Helen.
You came to me.
The child.
We had a deal.
Surrender to me now and he shall be unharmed.
We have a bargain.
But I' m afraid.
Do you fear the pain or what is beyond?
Both.
The pain, I can assure you, will be exquisite.
As for our deaths, there is nothing to fear.
Our names will be written on a thousand walls.
Our crimes told and retold by our faithful believers.
We shall die together in front of their very eyes and give them something to be haunted by.
Come with me and be immortal.
You' re mine now.
It' s time for a new miracle.
(Candyman) It was always you, Helen.
It was always you.
He' s here.
I' m coming.
It' s OK.
Check it out, man.
(Man) What happened?
(Man # 2) We got the Candyman out there.
(Jake) I saw him go in there.
Candyman' s in there.
I saw him.
I knew you' d come.
Burn him.
Help!
You lied to me!
We must be on our way now, you and l.
Our bones will soon be ashes and we shall never be separated again.
Let me go.
We are already dead.
Come back to me!
Come back!
(Minister) We commend to almighty God our sister Helen and we commit her body to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
The lord bless her and keep her and give her peace.
God of holiness and power accept our prayers on behalf of your servant Helen.
Do not count her deeds against her.
For in her heart she desired to do your will.
May almighty God bless you the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
(Man) My God, look at that.
(Stacey) Trevor?
What is it?
Trevor, are you all right?
Aren' t you hungry?
No, I' m OK.
I' il eat a little bit later.
I was going to make us a nice dinner.
Hey, why don' t you help me make the salad?
OK, I' il be there in a minute.
Helen...
Oh, Helen.
Helen.
Helen.
Helen.
What' s the matter, Trevor?
Scared of something?
Trevor?
Trevor?
Where do you think you' re going?
Going home.
Officer.
The guy walked into the bushes, maybe to pee, but he never came back.
Do you need help?
Do you own this car?
That' s not him.
The guy walked into the bushes.
He said he was going home.
Going home?
Gentlemen, return to your cars.
What about the car?
I' il radio for a tow truck.
Let' s shove it out of the way.
We' il get this lane moving!
It' s dangerous.
We got a lot of glass and steel rushing by us at high speeds.
Wait a minute.
Prendergast.
Downtown Robbery.
Let' s go.
I' m in linoleum tile, myself.
All right.
You, back in your vehicle.
You push.
I' il steer.
We do ceramics too.
Special discount for law officers.
I love Cops, the TV show.
I never miss it.
You' re lucky you caught me.
I am?
Today' s my last day as a cop.
Lucky me.
Don' t touch it!
Don' t touch it!
Just get this lane moving.
Okay.
Sorry.
Officer?
The phone!
Come on, baby.
Watch your fingers.
Take Tucker, okay?
Mom?
Mom, can you help me open this?
Can I get some change for the phone, please?
No change.
Have to buy something.
- Eighty- fie sen.
- What?
Eighty- fie sen.
- I don' t understand.
- Eighty- fie sen!
Eighty- five cents?
It doesn' t give me enough money for the phone call.
I' il give you 50 cents.
You give me 50 cents change.
- No way.
- Yes, way.
Drink, eighty- fie sen.
You pay or go!
I don' t understand "fie."
There' s a "V" in the word "five."
No "V' s" in China?
- Not Chinese.
I' m Korean.
- Whatever.
You come to my country, take my money and don' t even learn my language?
You' re Korean?
Do you have any idea how much money my country has given your country?
How much?
I don' t know.
It' s a lot.
You can bet on that.
You go now!
No trouble!
I stay.
What do you think of that?
Jesus Christ!
What is this?
The last stand on Fiji?
Take the money!
Take the money!
Take the money.
Take your hands away from your -- I can' t under -- Stop it!
All right.
Speak slowly and distinctly.
Take the money.
You think I' m a thief?
You see, I' m not the thief.
I' m not the one charging 85 cents for a stinking soda!
You' re the thief!
I' m just standing up for my rights as a consumer.
I' m rolling back prices to 1965.
What do you think of that?
Doughnuts.
Package of six.
How much? $1. 12.
Too much.
Aspirin.
Price? $3. 40.
Oh, please!
Package of four.
$4. 29.
Nice try.
This whole shelf looks suspect.
One soda...... 12 ounces.
Fifty sen!
Sold.
It' s been a pleasure frequenting your establishment.
Very funny.
Very, very funny.
Genuine Arizona sand, Prendergast.
Get used to it.
I bet.
Genuine Santa Monica sand' s more like it.
It' s from my cat' s litter box, but he said you could keep the lumps.
You took my stuff out first?
How fun would that be?
- How do I get a pen out?
Use the cat turd.
Be careful.
Remember Forsythe?
- Forsythe got 5 minutes to retirement.
Two minutes, nothing!
The guy was on the way to his fucking car.
Mowed down by a runaway impound.
Nasty.
- Ironic.
- Ironic as fuck!
Anything can happen today.
You know how dangerous a desk can be.
Watch out for paper cuts.
Funny, funny, funny.
Sorry.
I tried to dissuade them.
It' s obligatory, I guess.
Now, what else do they have up their sleeve?
Nothing.
Are we still on for lunch?
You' re not going home early?
Why would I go home early?
Last day and all.
I' m not superstitious.
- Sandy, you ready?
- In a minute.
Leave the poor desk jockey alone.
See if you know how to start the car.
Let' s not get our pantyhose in a bind.
I' il miss you, Prendergast.
You really will?
Me too.
Come on, let' s go!
Lunch?
Just a second, baby.
When will we make the strawberry cake?
Soon.
I thought sundown would be good.
Not in the house.
Just a few kids.
I didn' t want to do a whole big thing.
Prendergast here.
It' s me.
I wish you were home.
Wouldn' t you come home now?
What' s wrong?
I don' t know.
I got a little scared...... and I' d like you to come home.
What is it, honey?
I don' t know.
I was wrapping some...... some glasses up and some things...... and I got really scared.
You' re not doing this move just for me, are you?
You really want to do it, don' t you?
The important thing is we' re together.
That' s what counts.
Yeah, but you' re not here.
Well, I will be soon, baby.
Say it.
- Say it!
- I' il be home soon.
No, say it!
I' il be home soon, and I love you.
I love you too.
Feel better?
No, I don' t feel better!
London Bridge is falling down
Falling down, falling down
London bridge is falling down Help me.
My fair lady
You my fair lady?
Yes.
- Bye.
- Bye- bye.
What you doing, Mister?
Nothing.
You' re trespassing on private property.
- Trespassing?
- Loitering too.
That' s right.
You' re loitering too.
I didn' t see any signs.
What you call that?
Graffiti?
No, man.
That' s not fucking graffiti!
That' s a sign.
He can' t read it, man.
I' il read it for you.
It says this is private property.
No fucking trespassing.
This means fucking you!
- It says all that?
- Yeah!
If you wrote it in English, I' d fucking understand it!
- Thinks he' s being funny.
- I' m not laughing.
- I' m not either.
- Hold it, fellas.
We' re getting off on the wrong foot.
This is a gangland thing, isn' t it?
We' re having a territorial dispute?
I' ve wandered into your pissing ground or whatever the damn thing is...... and you' re offended by my presence.
I understand that.
I mean, I wouldn' t want you people in my back yard, either.
This is your home...... and your home is your home.
So if you would just back up a step or two...... I' il take my problems elsewhere.
Fair enough?
- What do you think?
- He should pay a toll.
Good idea.
You should pay a toll.
Listen, fellas...... I' ve had a rare morning.
What should he pay?
How about that briefcase?
Good idea.
Give us your briefcase, man.
I' m not giving you my goddamn briefcase.
Motherfucker, give us your motherfucking briefcase!
I was willing to mind my own business.
You couldn' t let a man...... sit here for five minutes to rest on your precious piece- of- shit hill?
Want my briefcase?
I' il get it for you, all right?
You want my briefcase?
Here' s my briefcase!
Where are you going?
You forgot the briefcase!
I' m going home!
Clear the path, you motherfucker!
Clear the path!
I' m going home!
How' d they do that?
- What?
You' re leaving today, right?
I gotta get your gun.
Right.
I need your John Doe right here, here and here.
Got time to take a statement?
I know you wanna go before you get killed...
Yeah, Brian, I' m still working here.
This guy' s a little excited.
Mr. Lee, come on in.
What' d he say?
You know, I don' t know.
Mr. Lee is Korean.
I' m Japanese, in case you never bothered to notice.
- Mr. Lee, speak English, okay?
- Sure.
Sit down.
He' il help you.
Mr. Lee owns a market.
He was hit less than an hour ago.
Sorry, Mr. Lee, no smoking.
Mr. Lee, let' s just start off with what he looked like.
White man, white shirt, tie.
- What color was his tie?
- Color?
I don' t know color.
The guy attack me, okay?
He bust up my store.
I' m lucky to be alive.
Just try and relax.
What did he steal from you?
Did not steal!
Attack me, okay?
Say he fix my prices.
Bust up my merchandise.
He didn' t rob you?
The guy crazy!
I told him, "Take my money."
He say no.
He call me "thief," then he break up my merchandise.
Then he buy a soda and take off.
He bought a soda.
He paid for it?
I told you, the guy crazy.
Sorry, I thought this was a robbery.
Mr. Lee, we have to go talk to somebody else.
You were assaulted.
This man works robberies.
That' s right.
Come on.
- Baseball bat!
- What' s that?
The guy take my baseball bat.
You sell bats?
No, keep for defense.
Under counter.
Defense.
You mean he stole your baseball bat but paid for the soda?
This guy' s discriminating.
That still doesn' t count.
Let' s go.
Thanks.
Go to the hospital.
Your arm might be broken!
We' il look for this guy, so shut the fuck up!
What did this guy do?
Threaten you with his credit card?
I told you he had a bat!
If this guy' s still around, we' il find him and fuck him up.
Then you go to the hospital?
Shut up!
Cut the crap.
I know it' s you.
What do you want?
It is you, isn' t it?
Yeah, it' s me.
You gotta stop calling me.
It' s Adele' s birthday.
Yes, I know.
What do you want?
I' m coming home.
What are you talking about?
I just...
I want you to know that I' m coming home for her birthday.
You' re not coming here.
Listen, Beth...... I gotta see you.
No, you listen to me.
This is my house now.
I pay the rent.
You don' t pay child support.
- You just can' t walk in and out.
- Don' t talk like that, Beth.
I have to come home.
I have to bring her a present.
You know you can' t come here!
It' s him!
It' s him, man!
How' s Adele?
This isn' t your home anymore.
How is she?
She' s doing just fine without you.
- Angie, get out.
- Come on, man.
It' s fucking broad daylight!
This shit ain' t worth it!
- Get the fuck out!
- Get out of the car!
Give me one.
And you?
Don' t.
I' il call the police.
Go, go, go!
I' m coming home.
I' m coming home.
Did you get him?
You missed.
I missed too.
No, don' t fucking do it!
No, man.
Fuck you, mother --!
There, you see?
That' s the concept.
Take some shooting lessons, asshole!
She' s open.
Have a seat.
Captain.
Did you hear?
The drive- by shooting?
Disgusting!
You know who' il have to take the heat again...... when the shit hits the fan.
You' re retiring a little early.
You won' t be getting your full pension.
Yes, sir, that' s right.
I won' t.
This isn' t because you were wounded, is it?
Wounded?
Because, I mean...... you' re behind a desk now.
Not much chance of getting wounded there.
Look, captain, it has nothing to do with that.
I' il make my speech.
They make me do this, you understand.
I hate to lose a good cop.
Not too late to change your mind.
Lot of good cops want to drop the whole kit and caboodle.
And who wouldn' t?
The pay stinks...... and you' re up to your ears in human scum 16 hours a day.
But it gets in your blood.
A lot of good cops get to the point of...... slapping their badge down on this desk...... and find they just can' t do it.
How about you?
Will you stick with the team?
No, captain.
I don' t think I will.
Like I say, they make me ask.
You understand.
How are the kids?
I don' t have any.
What the hell?
I' d like to take my stick to these clerks.
- The file says -- - We lost a child.
Lost it?
Her.
Lost her.
Yes, of course.
That' s rough.
Well, it can be.
Yes, sir.
Still married, right?
Yes, sir, I am.
That' s good.
Where you going?
- I' m going home.
- Not this way.
- Why not?
- Metrorail construction, that' s why not.
Go around.
Just follow your tootsies.
You sure you don' t want something?
Coffee, soda, something?
No, thank you, ma' am.
I feel kind of stupid about this.
Better safe than sorry.
That' s what I thought.
You have a restraining order against your husband?
Ex- husband.
He' d show up on the wrong day...... or in the middle of the night, pounding on the door.
I didn' t know if a restraining order was a good idea...... and if it' d do more harm than good.
But the judge said we should make an example of him.
So he can' t come within 100 feet of us.
Or is it yards?
Feet or yards?
That' s up to the judge.
- I thought it was a set thing.
- It' s at his discretion.
That' s interesting.
Does he drink?
Oh, I thought you meant the judge!
- No, I wouldn' t say so.
- Do drugs?
But he has a propensity for violence?
Yeah, I think you could say that.
Did he strike the little girl?
Did he strike you?
Not exactly.
Not exactly?
You know, there were times...... when I thought he was going to...... but I just didn' t want to wait until he got around to it.
It' s hard to explain.
He could, I think.
You think?
How are you today?
I' m doing all right.
- How about you?
I' m terrible.
I' m sorry.
I came from Santa Barbara, and my friend wasn' t home...... and he owes me money...... so I have no money to go home.
I' m almost out of gas.
I had to sleep in my car.
Do you have a few bucks?
It would really help me out.
Give me your address, I' il mail it back.
- Let me see your driver' s license.
- What for?
It' il have your address on it.
- I don' t have a license.
- You drove all the way without it?
Are you a cop?
Let' s see your car registration and your car.
All right, forget it.
Okay, just forget it!
That' s a hell of a way to treat a vet, man.
- You' re an animal doctor?
- No, a veteran.
I was in Nam.
You must' ve been 10 years old.
I meant to say the Gulf.
Come on!
All I' m asking for is a little change.
I haven' t eaten in three days.
Well, I mean, except for this.
Fuck it!
Give me some money, man.
Just give me some money.
How about a dime?
Give it to me.
I' m not giving you any.
- You got a cigarette?
- You gotta give me something.
- Why don' t you get a job?
This is my park.
I live here!
Who are you, walking through my park with two bags?
I don' t got any.
Is that fair?
What' s in those bags, anyway?
Give me one.
I could sell those bags and eat for a week with the money.
Why do you need two?
You' re right.
Here.
- Are you serious?
- I don' t need it anymore.
All right!
Come on, now.
What the --
Son of a bitch!
- Can we cut the crap this time?
- I' m telling you the truth!
Yeah, right.
- What' s up?
- She was at the drive- by shooting.
- Angie, who hit your guys?
- I told you.
The big bad white man.
We' re not buying it.
Who are you protecting?
They put your boyfriend in the hospital.
He' s probably dead.
Do you realize that?
He' s probably fucking dead!
- Stop saying that!
- You picked a good day to leave.
You want another 3- year- old to get shot in the head?
Is that what you want?
Tell me the truth!
I' m telling you the truth!
It was a white guy!
- Why would he go after your friends?
- I don' t know!
He attacked them on Angel' s Flight Hill with a baseball bat!
A baseball bat?
Wait!
Baseball bat.
What did this guy look like?
I don' t know.
He looked like you...... except he was taller and had hair.
Good description, Angie!
Did he wear a white shirt and tie?
Come over here, will you?
We gotta keep the pressure on her.
Don' t interrupt.
What about the bat?
- The white shirt and tie!
- What will she think of next?
I' m sorry you' re leaving, but you are.
- Sanchez, listen to me!
- Check me later, babe.
Remember that storekeeper, the Korean guy?
- Mr. Lee?
- Come here.
Where was his place?
Right there.
He was assaulted sometime after 8 a. m.?
- About that.
- And the drive- by was here, right?
What' s going on?
I may be nuts, but Angel' s Flight Hill is between those two spots.
- It was a classy neighborhood.
Gangland.
What would a white guy in a shirt and tie be doing in...... gangland?
Can I help you?
I' d like a ham and cheese Whamlette, an order of Wham fries --
We' re on the lunch menu.
I want breakfast.
We' re not serving it.
So you said.
Is that the manager?
Could I speak to him, please?
Sure.
Rick, a customer would like to speak to you.
Yes, sir.
I' d like some breakfast.
We stopped serving breakfast.
I know you stopped breakfast, Rick.
Sheila told me you stopped...
I don' t know you.
I call my boss "Mister" after 7 years, but I walk in here, a stranger...... and I' m calling you Rick and Sheila like we' re in an AA meeting.
I don' t want to be your buddy, Rick.
I just want a little breakfast.
You can call me Miss Folsom if you want to.
We stopped serving breakfast at 11: 30.
Have you ever heard the expression, "The customer is always right '"
Well, here I am.
The customer.
That' s not our policy.
You have to order something from the lunch menu.
I don' t want lunch.
I want breakfast.
Yeah, well, hey, I' m really sorry.
Yeah, well, hey, I' m really sorry too!
He' s got a gun!
Let' s get organized!
Calm down!
Just calm down, everybody.
Sit down over there!
Mister.
Where are you going?
No.
You sit down there, and you finish your lunch.
Everybody just relax and take it easy.
Please.
You all need your vitamins A, B and --
Don' t!
It was an accident!
It' s sensitive.
It' s okay!
It' s a sensitive trigger.
Could I have my breakfast?
Yes, sir.
Sheila?
Rick?
Miss Folsom?
You know what?
I' ve changed my mind.
I' m going to have some lunch.
Could I have a double Whammyburger with cheese --
- You getting this?
- Yes, sir.
And an order of Whammy fries and, let' s see...... a Choco- Wham shake.
Yes, sir.
Sheila, get his order.
Rick, could you get it for me, please?
I feel comfortable calling you Rick after all we' ve been through together.
How you doing?
Enjoying your meal?
How about you?
Is it good?
And you, ma' am?
How' s the food?
I think we have a critic.
I don' t think she likes the special sauce.
That' s a joke.
Now, here we go.
Thank you.
See, this is what I' m talking about.
Look at that.
See what I mean?
It' s plump, juicy, three inches thick.
Look at this sorry, miserable, squashed thing.
Can anybody tell me what' s wrong with this picture?
Anybody?
Anybody at all.
You guys are partners again!
No such luck, Lita.
He' s moving to Lake Havasu.
- What' s in Lake Havasu?
- London Bridge.
- Are you going to England?
- They moved it to Arizona.
- Stone by stone.
I heard about that.
You' re better off, because cops get killed.
- What did we used to get, six?
- Seven.
Two sevens.
You all right?
You sure?
I' m sorry, I wasn' t gonna do this.
It' s none of my business.
Tell me.
Lake Havasu?
It' s nice.
We like it.
She likes it.
What' il you do, watch cactus grow?
Cacti.
The change of life and all that, whatever it is that is.
What about you?
It' s different, because she' s a woman.
I' m a woman.
But she was once very beautiful.
Thanks a lot!
Come on, come on.
Anything but a cop' s wife.
She' s high- strung.
Don' t give me that queen of the hop, homecoming- queen bullshit again.
That was a long time ago.
Sandra, you have a career.
It' s hard to lose your beauty when that' s all you' ve got.
What about your career?
I' il be okay...... you know, even without you.
Sorry to break this up.
- Why are you here?
- We got a call.
Watch out!
Hot plates!
- Don' t touch my gun.
- Fuck you!
You' il love this one.
Then he paid for it and left.
Sorry, Prendergast.
He paid for it?
Move your buns.
I gotta go.
Where was this?
Quintero and Fourth.
Bye, ladies.
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait!
Let me know what this guy was wearing, okay?
You trying to crack a big one before you disappear into the desert?
Sandra, find out if he' s wearing a white shirt and tie.
Let' s go, lovebirds.
- I gotta go.
- Wait.
Maybe I never mentioned it.
What?
I love her.
Let' s go!
For seven years, I banked here.
When I asked them for a loan, a small loan...... they told me that I was not "economically viable."
Excuse me.
Did they give you a loan?
He must be economically viable!
There' s a man with a smiling face.
A happy customer.
That' s what an economically viable person looks like!
How much is the...?
That is only $3.
You know what they told me?
I was not economically viable.
That' s enough.
- I' il buy this.
- Yes, sir.
That is $3.
I' m going away now!
I' m going away, everybody!
This is what happens if you' re not economically viable!
Don' t let this happen to you!
Bye, everybody!
Don' t forget me.
I' m sorry.
We' re leaving now.
Really?
It doesn' t look like your husband' s gonna show.
He probably realized he could get into trouble if he harassed you.
You should call your lawyer and tell him about it.
It' s one of those services.
I didn' t have much money.
Have them call your husband' s lawyer, make it official.
In the meantime, lock up.
And if anything else happens, call us.
- Okay, thanks.
- Sure thing.
Excuse me.
Hey, excuse me!
If you haven' t noticed, others are waiting to use the phone.
- Others want the phone?
- Right, asshole!
Jeez, that' s too bad, because you know what?
I think it' s out of order.
Hi, it' s me.
He' s eating and resting comfortably now.
- Who is?
- Mr. Peepers.
- Good!
- I' m sorry about before.
I really blew my top...
That' s okay, honey.
Could you hold on one second?
White shirt and tie.
Could you hold on?
I gotta go.
Just one second.
It' s very important.
Detective Torres!
Excuse me.
We have about 7 million people waiting to make a statement.
Let me call you right back.
What' s wrong?
What are you doing?
Nothing' s wrong.
What do you mean?
- You come home then.
- I can' t.
It' s your last day.
What are they going to do, fire you?
There' s a lot of red tape.
As soon as I get done, I can go home.
I' il call you in a while, okay?
Wait a minute.
Make a list.
- A list?
- We need boneless chicken...... skinless.
Red peppers...... not green, red.
Honey, hold on one second.
I am tying up the phone here.
Just listen for once in your life.
A girl at the drive- by said a man in a shirt and tie...... attacked her homeboys with a baseball bat.
Somebody' s let that dog off the leash.
I think you' ve got last- day- itis.
This man was not swinging a bat.
He has a gym bag full of guns.
A gym bag?
You asked me to tell you what he wore.
I gotta run.
We have to canvas the neighborhood.
One more second.
It' s important.
- Why don' t you go to the store?
- Why?
It' s my last day.
The guys might want to have a send off or something.
What' re they gonna do?
Get some broad...... with tassels dangling, dancing on your desk?
Course not.
Look, while you have been playing cop...... I' m at home planning your retirement.
It' s over.
The sooner you get that, the better.
You are no longer in the law- enforcement business.
Now, I will expect you at the usual time.
Capito?
Sandra, are you mad at me?
- I hate you, but I' m not mad.
- You retiring too?
Just don' t leave without saying goodbye.
Goodbye.
If you go up against this guy...... be careful.
I' m Nick.
What can I do you for?
I' m just looking for some hiking boots.
Well, well.
Hiking boots, huh?
Let' s see what we got.
These are the top of the line.
Scientifically engineered and all that crap.
Guaranteed by some Sierra Club asshole not to hurt a chipmunk...... if you step on it.
Personally, I think they' re for pussies and faggots!
Now these...... are Vietnam jungle boots.
Cost half as much, last twice as long and are great...... for stomping queers!
When you' re done, you gotta clean out the waffle with a stick...... but you can' t have everything, right?
Forget it.
Come on, let' s go.
Have a nice day, fellas!
Y' all come back now, you hear?
You got a problem, buddy?
You got the problem!
- No, you do, buddy!
- Read the sign!
"I reserve the right."
Now take a hike.
Make me.
Take it easy, Mary.
Take it easy.
- Jesus!
- Come on, make your play.
Would you just come on!
I don' t need this shit today.
Fucking redneck!
Fascist!
Fucking faggots!
You believe this shit?
Jesus!
Alternate lifestyle, my ass!
Imagine what those pumpkins do with each other when they' re alone!
Think about it.
Sergeant Prendergast.
She don' t have to talk!
What do you want?
I admitted it was a gang!
She don' t have to say a word!
I know it was a white guy.
We gotta talk.
It' s important.
How many guns were in the gym bag?
I don' t know what you' re talking about.
I didn' t see no gym bag!
The white guy took it, right?
More people could get hurt.
Now help me out.
The bag was already in the car when I got in.
How many guns were in it?
I don' t know.
Lots of guns.
They got all the guns in the fucking world.
Good?
Can I help you?
Police officer.
I' m looking for a man.
Are you now?
Late 30s...... white shirt and tie...... he' d be carrying a gym bag.
What' s the police scanner for?
My own personal amusement.
Seen anyone like I' ve described?
Nope.
- Okay, thanks.
- Listen.
Tell me something.
Why don' t they call you guys...... officer- esses?
I beg your pardon?
You know, like actress?
Like that?
Something to signify...... you know.
I guess they feel that a police officer is a police officer...... not a...... "you know."
Thanks for your cooperation, sir.
Sorry I couldn' t be of more help, officer- ess.
Why' d you do that?
There' s something I wanna show you.
I' m not gonna turn you in.
I' m your friend.
Come on.
I don' t bring just anybody back here.
This is my own private stash.
I got some great stuff here.
World War I. Good shape.
Speaking of gas, wait a minute.
Wait just a minute.
You know what was in this?
Zyklon- B.
You remember?
What the Nazis had?
Listen.
Empty.
This was used, man.
This was actually used.
I wonder how many kikes this little can took out.
Think about it.
Here.
Why are you showing me this?
I' m not.
That' s just for fun.
You can keep that.
This is what I want to show you.
The real thing.
Heat- seeking, shoulder- fired.
It' s fucking disposable!
You can take out a jet with one of these monkeys.
It' s for you.
I want you to have it.
Why?
Because I' m with you.
Don' t you get it?
I listened to the scanner.
I heard about Whammyburger.
Fucking fantastic!
It' s a bunch of niggers, right?
On TV, it' s always white kids.
But when you go in there, it' s nothing but a bunch of niggers!
They' il spit on your food if you' re not nice.
I know all about it.
I' m with you.
We' re the same, you and me.
We' re the same.
Don' t you see?
We are not the same.
I' m an American.
You' re a sick asshole.
What kind of vigilante are you?
I am not a vigilante.
I' m just trying to get home for my little girl' s birthday.
And if everybody will stay out of my way, nobody will get hurt.
Fuck you!
Who the fuck are you?
Are you fucking with me?
I am just disagreeing with you!
In America, we have freedom of speech, the right to disagree!
Fuck you and your freedom!
Who the fuck are you?
You fuck!
You faggot fuck!
Gonna take my rocket.
I ought to shoot you, motherfucker!
Now turn around!
Now lean on that counter!
Go on, lean on it!
Look at this shit!
What is this doing in there?
Faggot shit!
You want freedom, huh?
I' il give you fucking freedom!
Further back.
Feet farther back.
Spread them out.
Farther.
You' re going to jail, motherfucker!
How' s that for freedom?
Freedom to get fucked up the ass by some big buck nigger.
Give me your hand.
He' s gonna be right behind you, just like this.
Think about it.
You gonna like that, faggot?
You gonna like that, you faggot fuck?
Give me your other hand.
- I can' t.
- Why not?
Gravity.
Gravity?
What the fuck does that mean?
I' il fall down.
Now give me your other hand!
Give it to me now!
Give it to me!
Give it to me!
Come on.
Give it to me.
This isn' t one of mine.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Good!
Freedom of religion.
Now you get the swing of it!
Feels good to exercise your rights.
I' m listening.
We got a nutcase with a bag full of guns.
He' s in Hollywood, heading west.
What is he up to?
He' s up to a lot of trouble.
Never mind, we' ve got a hallway full of suspects.
It wasn' t a gang thing.
I can tell you that.
Angelina is a tramp and a liar.
We don' t appreciate you interfering with our investigation.
I' ve got a positive I. D. on the gym bag, okay?
What' s this?
A gym bag.
Does this mean you' re putting me under arrest?
You guys take off.
They make me do it.
This one' s from me.
I' ve never liked you.
You know why?
You don' t curse.
I don' t trust a man who doesn' t curse.
Not a "fuck" or a "shit" in all these years.
Real men curse.
And I don' t like a man who' s afraid to hit the street.
- It' s bad for morale.
- I' m not afraid.
Get back behind that desk where you belong...... and don' t waste any more of my time pretending you' re a cop.
A man in a white shirt and tie shot up a phone booth near the Whammyburger.
- Did you hear me?
- I heard you.
Right about here, right?
How did you know?
He got the bag of guns at the drive- by.
Then you were right.
Excuse me.
- What is wrong with you?
I' m a coward, the captain told me.
Get out of my way.
It is your own fault.
You let everybody think that, when it was your wife.
She made you get off the street.
What happens between me and my wife is nobody' s business but mine!
Sorry, I' ve been a bitch all day.
She didn' t make me quit.
I came home late one night...... and found her sitting in the dark.
She thought I' d been killed.
I had to chase her all over the house.
- I' m sorry.
- Forget it.
- Where are you going?
- See if I can earn my last day' s pay.
Let me go with you.
I thought you were on duty.
What do you say, partner?
Fuck them!
Go!
Who were you talking to a while ago?
You' re trying to scare me.
Am I succeeding?
No, you' re not succeeding.
So you just might as well stop it.
And you' re not scaring me out of my own house.
And you' re not coming here.
But I am.
I' m on my way.
You can count on that.
I' m past the point of no return.
Do you know when that is?
That' s the point in a journey...... where it' s longer to go back to the beginning...... than it is to continue to the end.
It' s like...
Remember when those astronauts got in trouble?
They were going to the moon and something went wrong.
They had to get back to Earth...... but they had passed the point of no return.
So they had to go all the way around the moon to get back...... and they were out of contact for hours.
Everybody waited to see if a bunch of dead guys in a can...... would pop out the other side.
That' s me.
On the other side of the moon now...... out of contact...... and everybody' s just going to have to wait till I pop out.
The police are here.
Did you know, Beth...... that in certain South American countries it' s still legal...... to kill your wife if she insults you?
They' re here right now.
I' m looking at one right now.
Put him on the phone.
- What are we gonna do?
- Talk to the Korean guy.
Then we just start banging on doors.
What is it?
Where are you going?
I' il be right back.
I' m sure the guy will let you use his bathroom.
Prendergast, what are you doing?
I know who this guy is!
Who is he?
He had a personalized license plate.
What the hell was it?
It said, "D- Fens."
Defense?
D- dash- F- E- N- S.
"D- Fens."
They said he was on his way home.
Go check out his address.
Mr. Lee!
Defense!
Hold it!
Back up.
You dumb bitch!
You cut me off!
What' s wrong with you!
Out of the way!
What are you, a moron?
If I wanted to be in a parking lot, I' d buy a ticket, you dumb bitch!
You can' t come this way.
What are you doing?
Fixing the street!
What does it look like?
Two days ago, it was fine.
You' re saying it fell apart in two days?
Well, I guess so.
Pardon me, but that' s bullshit!
I don' t think anything' s wrong with the street.
You' re trying to justify your budgets.
- Are you nuts?
- I know how it works.
If you don' t spend your budget, you won' t get any money next year.
I want you to admit nothing' s wrong with the street!
Fuck you, pal!
You' re not gonna hold us hostage with these yellow lights and big trucks.
That' s all.
I want to hear it from you.
What' s wrong with the street?
I don' t know.
I really don' t.
I think it' s a sewer job.
You' re lying.
What' s wrong with the street?
Nothing.
I knew it.
See, I knew it was fine.
But I' il give you something to fix.
- Oh, Jesus -- - Here!
Hey, Charlie!
Oh, please, man!
We got a goddamn nut here!
Fucking guy back there with a bazooka!
Pull that thing off.
- What thing?
- That.
Then pull on both ends.
It gets bigger.
Like this?
Now flip that thing up.
It' s your aimer.
How do you know?
I saw it on TV.
What' s the name of the movie?
What' s the movie you' re making?
Under Construction.
You like it?
It' s all right.
Where' s the cameras?
The cameras are on.
Just stand back.
What do I do now?
Just look through the aimer.
What you aiming at?
That yellow monster down there.
Look at it and pull the trigger.
It' s really easy.
Trigger?
That one right there.
But aim first, man.
Look out!
- Nothing happened.
- Must have been a dud or something.
Cool, man!
I' il sic the dog on you!
Police officers, ma' am.
How are you?
Where' s the dog?
He' s dead.
- What is it?
- We need to ask you some questions.
Just a few questions, ma' am.
What kind of questions?
Do you have a warrant?
You invited us in.
Now I' m inviting you out.
What relation are you to William Foster?
What are you saying?
He' s my son.
I don' t want you here.
Would you look at this?
This is really amazing.
Amazing!
Does he have another house, another place he might call home?
Now this is a what?
- A dragon?
- Don' t touch that!
Why would he do that?
This is his home.
- I want you to go now.
- Did this one melt?
That one.
It' s a giraffe, drinking.
Now, of all of these, which is your very favorite?
Right now, I think this skunk.
That' s lovely.
That' s not paint.
You know, his stripe.
It isn' t?
It might be, but it' s not painted on.
It' s in the glass.
What the hell?
It' s the groundskeeper.
Well, if he is, he' s out of uniform.
Hey, you there!
What are you doing there?
Just passing through.
Nobody said you could play through.
Get off my hole.
He said he was passing through.
He' s not a member.
Look how he' s dressed.
Get off my golf course!
I am!
Go back the way you came!
I don' t like his looks.
Leave him alone.
What am I paying dues for?
This is my golf course!
If I want to play here, I will!
If he gets hit with my Titleist, that' s his problem!
Don' t yell at me.
I' m just here playing with you --
Fore!
Fore!
Five!
Wait a minute!
What the hell you trying to do?
Kill me with a golf ball?
It' s not enough you got all this land for your little game?
But you had to kill me with a golf ball?
You should have a petting zoo...... instead of electric carts for you old men with nothing better to do.
Frank, what' s wrong?
Frank!
Aren' t you ashamed of yourself?
- I gotta get some help!
- What' s wrong with you?
- Help!
- Your heart?
Something' s wrong with your heart?
What can I do?
Pills!
Pills?
Where are they?
Cart, cart.
Call the paramedics!
My friend just had a heart attack!
I guess you' re out of luck.
Your little cart' s gonna drown.
Aren' t you sorry you didn' t let me pass through your golf course?
Now you' re gonna die wearing that stupid little hat.
How does it feel?
This is his room.
You' re a very neat and tidy lady.
He cleans his own room.
Now don' t make me call you a liar.
If he wasn' t at work, I' d be afraid to set foot in here.
What' s he been doing lately?
Same as ever.
Building important things to protect us from the Communists.
He works at Notec.
The defense plant.
D- Fens.
Call Notec and see if you can get him.
So what' s going on with your son?
- How do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.
Sometimes he sits through an entire meal without saying a word.
He just shovels food into his mouth like a machine.
I get so nervous...... I can' t swallow.
I' il sit there with the same piece of food in my mouth.
When I do, he looks at me...... like he' d like to kill me.
Don' t tell him I said that.
I promise I won' t.
I' m not just talking financial.
How could you be a burden to anyone?
If William, or Bill, as I like to call him --
He likes Bill.
I call him Bill too.
If Bill said he was going home...... could he have meant where his wife and child live?
Ex- wife.
We shouldn' t be in here.
Elizabeth.
What' s her maiden name?
Trevino.
She was part Italian.
You know how they are.
- Where' s Elizabeth now?
- I wouldn' t know.
You don' t know where your grandchild lives?
He doesn' t want me to know.
He blames me for what happened.
What' s the word?
- He was fired over a month ago.
- What?
Where has he been going every day?
Where has he been eating his lunch?
Why are you putting barbed wire on that fence?
Is it a joke?
Is this how rich people have fun?
You put barbed wire on the fence...... so innocent people like me can cut our hands?
I' m the caretaker.
It' s just a barbecue.
Dr. Ashcroft has let us do this before.
You don' t live here?
Is it really necessary to tell them?
Tell who?
Altmore Security.
Aren' t you with them?
No, please!
It' s okay, baby.
What kind of doctor lives here?
Plastic surgeon.
Plastic surgery bought all this?
Guess I' m in the wrong racket.
Are there correspondence courses in plastic surgery?
I lost my job.
It lost me.
I' m overeducated, underskilled...
I forget.
And I' m obsolete.
I' m not economically viable.
I can' t even support my own kid.
Are you hurt?
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
It' s all right.
It' s your hand.
You cut your hand.
It' s my hand.
Please take me with you.
They won' t do anything if I' m with you.
Just please let them go.
What do you think?
You think I want to hurt your family?
I have a family of my own.
You don' t believe me?
We believe you.
That' s where I' m going.
I' m going home to see my family.
It' s my little girl' s birthday today.
We were gonna have a barbecue, like you guys...... and she was gonna play outside...... and my wife would hold my hand...... and talk about grownup things.
And then when it got dark...... we' d all go to sleep together.
We' d all sleep together in the dark.
And everything...... would be just like it was before.
You can' t leave.
Believe me, something' s happened to him.
It doesn' t take all day to drive from Pasadena to Venice.
That doesn' t constitute a threatening phone call.
The guy was talking about Star Trek or something.
- He' s getting a kick out of scaring you.
- Please don' t leave.
There' s only one thing you can do to really feel safer.
Next time there' s a proposition...... to cut the number of patrol cars on the street, vote no, okay?
Have a nice day.
What have you found so far?
No luck on Foster- Trevino.
Go straight to the maiden name.
I' ve got something on an Army- Navy store.
- Where?
- Here.
Jesus, Prendergast, I was there!
That guy was a prick.
You know what else he was?
Murdered.
They found him stuffed in his own display case.
Oh, my God!
Here, I' il help you change the --
You know what they did?
They turned our ice- cream parlor into a Southwest American, New Age thing.
I went to buy a rocking horse.
All I could find was a unicorn with an Indian on top of it.
Can you believe that, Elizabeth?
Can you believe it?
Come on!
Where are we going?
When' s my birthday?
Some G. I. Joe gave a geezer a heart attack at the golf course...... and accosted a family right next door.
A G. I. Joe?
He' s wearing the kind of jacket you find in an Army- Navy store.
I found her!
Trevino, Elizabeth.
Don' t tell me.
Venice.
How' d you know?
Where else would an Italian move to?
Look what I got.
We got a puppy.
We got a puppy.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Hi, puppy!
No answer at the ex- wife.
- You send the cavalry?
- No, Pacific Division are pricks.
They can' t send units to the same address three times in a day...... to comfort some hysterical woman.
- What do you want to do?
- Go to Venice.
Get that, would you?
Prendergast here.
Who the fuck is this?
Shit.
It' s your wife.
Hon?
Yeah, "hon." I know who that was!
Mr. Peepers just scratched the shit out of me...... and I' m bleeding like a stuck pig.
Something important' s come up.
What am I?
Dog vomit?
Your wife says she' s bleeding to death...... and you say something important has come up?
- When are you coming home?
- I don' t know.
Don' t tell me you don' t know.
I want to know when the hell you' re coming home, now!
Amanda, shut up!
Did you hear me?
Shut up!
I' il get home when I' m finished, not a second before.
Is that clear?
Is that clear?
You don' t have to bite my head off.
And you have dinner ready and waiting for me, okay?
And leave the skin on the chicken.
All right?
Goodbye.
Shit!
Let' s go!
Surprise!
I' m sorry, Prendergast!
We tried and tried, but could not fit your fucking name on the cake!
You made it out alive!
Listen, listen.
All right, hold it, hold it.
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you' ve been waiting for.
This afternoon' s entertainment, Miss Suzie!
Suzie Q!
Do your thing!
Is this the retiring boy?
Wait, wait!
This is great, guys.
This is great.
I appreciate it, but I can' t stay.
Jesus!
What' s your problem?
You afraid of women too?
You ever met his wife?
What did you say?
- What?
- What did you say?
Nothing.
We don' t have time for this.
You' re right.
Ready, honey?
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday...... to you
No cake for you?
If she doesn' t want it, don' t force her.
Okay, you can have the teddy.
Time to go horsy!
It' s okay.
Giddyap, giddyap.
- She doesn' t want to.
- Just put her on the horse!
There we go!
Horsy ride.
She doesn' t want to.
- Put her on the horse!
- You can' t force her like that.
I bought her the goddamn horse.
Here we go!
Horsy ride.
You' re scaring her.
I want you to stop this.
Come on, honey.
It' s your birthday.
It' s the pier.
It' s your favorite place.
You love the pier.
Why do you do this?
Take the back.
Freeze!
You okay?
- I' m all right.
- Somebody get an ambulance.
Call 911!
Get an ambulance!
Go, go, go!
Get an ambulance!
Be careful!
Go get the bastard!
He' s still dressed like G. I. Joe!
Daddy!
Mommy, look.
Daddy!
Hi, honey.
I thought I' d find you here.
Leave us alone!
I can' t talk to my wife?
I' m not your wife anymore.
Sugar, does this ring a bell?
"Till death do us part"?
Do you remember that?
I' m sorry.
Sorry, sorry.
What are you doing?
I' m coming home from a hard day at the office.
God bless the working stiffs!
Please leave her alone!
You' re so big!
How' d you get so big?
I missed it.
They stole it from me, honey.
They' re not gonna take it anymore.
Bill, listen, please.
You' ve got to stop this.
You need help.
You' re sick.
Sick?
You wanna see sick?
That' s sick.
You ain' t kidding.
Would you believe it that I used to fish right here?
This very spot?
It' s poisonous. "
You can' t even swim in the water.
It' il give you some kind of bacterial infection.
How' s that for sick?
Leave us alone.
I' m leaving soon.
I' m retiring to Arizona.
Lake Havasu City.
You been there?
That' s not what I mean!
They call it a lake, but it' s really just a big bowl of muddy water.
But the wife thinks it' s paradise.
Everybody has their own idea of what paradise is.
Take me, for instance.
You know what I thought paradise was?
- What?
- If you' il excuse me.
Making babies.
Ain' t that a kick?
Making babies.
This your little girl?
Beautiful.
She' s special.
You know, my wife never was cut out for motherhood.
She did it all for me.
Went through all that pain, lost her figure, for me.
Then the kid went to sleep one night, never woke up.
They called it "Infant Death...... Syndrome."
But she wasn' t an infant.
She was 2 years old.
She was a big girl.
She was our baby.
Here, darling, this is for you.
Here you go.
What can you do?
If she' d been hit by a drunk driver...
But who do you blame when they just don' t wake up?
Thank you, sweetheart.
There' s a guy with a gun!
No!
Don' t!
Elizabeth, no!
Freeze!
You' re under arrest.
Get out of here!
Freeze!
- What were you gonna do?
- I don' t know!
Guys like you always say that!
You know exactly what you were gonna do.
Kill your wife and child!
Then it' d be too late to turn back.
It' d be easy to kill yourself.
Let' s go meet some nice policemen.
They' re good guys.
Let' s go.
I' m the bad guy?
How did that happen?
I did everything they told me to.
Did you know I build missiles?
I help to protect America.
You should be rewarded for that.
Instead, they give it to the plastic surgeon.
They lied to me.
Is that what this is about?
You' re angry because you got lied to?
Is that why my dinner' s drying out in the oven?
They lie to everybody.
They lie to the fish!
That doesn' t give you any right to do what you did today.
The only thing that makes you special is that little girl.
Now, let' s go.
Let' s go!
Sure was hot today, wasn' t it?
The end of the pier!
Keep this crowd back!
Let' s get some backup!
You know, I got a gun.
In my pocket.
I got lots of guns.
Stay there.
Don' t move.
You wanna draw?
Let' s not.
Let' s call it a day.
Now come on.
It' s perfect.
Showdown between the sheriff and the bad guy?
It' s beautiful.
On three.
This doesn' t have to be the end.
You have a choice.
I don' t have a choice.
You do!
No, you have two choices:
I can kill you.
Or you can kill me...... and my little girl can get the insurance.
One...
Don' t you wanna see her grow up?
Behind bars?
Don' t do this.
Please.
- Let' s go!
- Three.
I would have got you.
What cooperation was there between Pacific Division and Downtown?
Not to denigrate the Venice Police...... but it was one of our fellows that put this together.
Prendergast!
This is Sergeant Prendergast.
Damn fine work, Prendergast.
Fuck you, Captain Yardley.
Fuck you very much!
I can' t believe -- Did he just say that?
You' re welcome.
- You still here?
- Afraid so.
We' ve stabilized her.
She' il be all right.
I' il see you at the hospital.
How are you doing?
I haven' t told her yet.
Oh, shit!
It' s her birthday.
What should I do?
Tell her tomorrow.
Let her have her little party.
- What' s your name, darling?
- Adele.
Adele?
That' s a nice name.
If I had a little girl, I' d want her to be named Adele.
- What' s yours?
- Mine?
My name is mud.
Your name is not mud.
It will be when my wife finds out that...... I' m still a cop.
Excuse me.
Sergeant just signed us out.
- All right, let' s eat.
- Where you wanna go?
Let' s go around the corner and get one of those...
Look what I got!
Just call him, "Hi, Puppy."
Hi, Puppy.
Hi, Puppy.
There we are!
We got everybody there.
We got everybody --
I got a business to run right here.
Maurice!
Jackie!
Jack!
Jackie!
Jack!
How you doing?
And Miss lovely Amber Waves.
I' m pissed you haven' t been around.
We were on vacation.
Don' t you ever stay away that long from my club again.
You are the sexiest bitch in the entire country!
I love you!
You' re such a charmer.
I got your booth set up.
I' il send some clams over.
Jack.
I' m ready.
I' m available.
Put me in a movie, okay?
Box office!
Chi- Chi.
Jack and Amber' s table, take them a order of clams.
Let' s go!
Vamos!
How' s it going here?
Baby, me and you... we' il take a picture later on.
We were looking for you before!
Where were you?
I was here.
Seriously, man!
I love you, Beck!
Cowboy!
That' s a cowboy?
It' s nice, right?
If you like it.
I love it!
Compliments of Maurice.
Can I get a Margarita, please?
7- Up.
Hi, Rollergirl.
Did you call that girl today?
I forgot.
After tomorrow, it' il be the weekend and you' il never be able to see her.
What' s the matter down there?
I got to pee.
Well, go then.
What' s happening?
I got to pee!
Hey, Jack.
Little Bill.
Amber, how are you?
How' s our schedule?
Are we still on for day after tomorrow?
The day after the day after tomorrow.
Jack, I got to call Rocky and Scotty, Kurt.
Small crew on this one, you know what I mean?
A low- key deal?
Exactly.
I' m sorry.
Do we have a script?
How you doing?
How old are you?
I have a work permit.
No, it' s nothing like that.
Worked here long?
A month.
Maurice give you the job?
Yeah.
You from around here?
I mean, Canoga?
Reseda?
No.
You know where Torrance is?
How do you get here?
I take the bus.
What do you want to be?
Excuse me?
You take the bus from Torrance to Reseda to do this job.
Can' t you get a job in Torrance?
Yeah, but I don' t want to.
So, you want 5 or 10?
What?
If you just want to see me jack- off, it' s 10.
If you just want to look at it, it' s only 5.
Guys pay you to watch you?
You done it tonight?
Couple of times.
You can do it again?
If you want.
If you got 10 bucks.
My name is Jack.
Eddie.
Eddie Adams.
Eddie Adams from Torrance.
Jack Horner.
Filmmaker.
Really?
Yeah.
Adult films.
Exotic pictures.
I know who you are.
I read about you in a magazine.
Inside Amber.
Amanda' s Ride.
Right?
Right.
So now you know I' m not full of doggy doo- doo.
Want t come to the table and have a drink?
I' d love to, but I got to work.
You have to work, get money, pay the rent.
Yeah.
I mean, no.
I need money, but I don' t pay rent.
I live at home.
How old are you, Eddie?
I' m 17.
17- year- old piece of gold.
Yeah, right.
Come.
I got people I' d like you to meet.
I do know who you are.
I' d love to come for a drink.
Obviously you' re not full of...
Doggy doo- doo.
But I couldn' t walk out on Maurice.
I' m sorry.
Under those jeans something wonderful' s waiting to get out.
Bye, Maurice.
Good night.
Listen, thank you.
Take care.
This is the man you let in anytime.
You understand?
Fix you some eggs, beauty?
No, I' m going to sleep.
Good night.
Good night, honey- tits.
Stay beautiful.
Tom?
Hi.
Yeah, it' s me.
I know that it' s late, but...
Is Andy there?
Is he?
I' d like to say hello to my son and that' s all.
Let me tell you something, Tom.
I know a lawyer.
You understand?
You might think I don' t, but I do and I' il take you to court!
Come on.
Tom, please.
Please.
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck does it look like I' m doing?
Close the door?
Will I close the door?
Will I close the door?
That' s my wife, you asshole.
Oh, I' m sorry.
Get out.
Go sleep on the couch.
Big Stud.
Jesus, please!
Shave if you' re going to do that.
You scratch my face.
Sorry.
Morning.
How' s it at work?
You get home late?
You work in a nightclub.
If it means so much to you, you should find one that' s closer.
I' ve got to get to work.
At a car wash.
What?
You work at a car wash.
You work at a nightclub.
School never occurred to you?
Bye, Dad.
Goodbye.
Basically you' re getting twice the bass... with the TK241, which we' ve... got available in this system.
I don' t know.
I don' t really know if I need all that bass.
I think you need all that bass.
If you want a system to handle what you want... you need the bass.
This is hi- fi.
High fidelity.
That means this is the highest quality fidelity.
Hi- fi.
Two important things to have in a stereo system.
It' s the price.
I have this unit in my home.
Really?
Yes, I do.
But, of course, I got it modified with the TK421.
Which kicks it up another... 3 or 4... quads per channel, you know?
But that' s technical talk.
That doesn' t concern you.
You' re still a little uncertain.
You know what you need?
A test drive.
You need a test drive.
It' s another thing to hear it from the TK421.
Let me pop in this 8- track.
Listen, and tell me what you think.
Hear that?
Right?
You hear it?
It kicks!
It curls up your belly.
It makes you wanna freaky- deaky, right?
Now if you get the system as is... it won' t sound like this without the TK421 modification.
And we do that in the store right here.
Very small price.
It helps me.
Thank you for your time.
Well, so long, partner.
What the fuck was that?
Have I told you?
What?
You put on a country- western shit, no one' il buy a stereo.
What kind of brother listens to that shit?
Look, Jerry...
No, no, no.
You look.
I thought your acting stuff might bring nice pussy in.
And it has.
But I can' t have anymore fuck- ups.
You dig?
You dig?
Yeah, I dig.
Now get in the back and unload those new 484' s.
All right.
Sorry.
Settle down, class.
This is your final.
Keep your test papers facedown until I tell you to turn them up.
Clear your tables, please.
There should be nothing on your desk but the test and a pencil.
We' re covering chapters 17 through 28.
Your eyes should stay on your test papers, please.
Are we ready?
Class, begin.
I love to suck cock.
I love to suck cock.
Honey?
You okay?
Sweetheart?
Is something wrong?
I got to get back.
I need it again.
I have to go to work.
Come on, give it to me.
Don' t make me pounce you.
I' il do it.
You promise?
That' s it.
You want it?
How bad?
Bad.
You sure?
You asked for it!
God. wait.
Stop!
What?
Your cock is so beautiful.
Do you know how good you are doing it, Eddie?
Having sex?
Fucking me?
Making love to me?
Everyone has one thing.
Everyone' s given one special thing, right?
That' s right.
Everyone' s blessed with one special thing.
I want you to know I plan on being a star.
A big bring shining star.
That' s what I want.
That' s what I' m going to get.
I know.
I got to go.
You' re lucky.
You want a ride?
You want a ride?
I' m going really far.
Do you remember me from a couple hours ago?
Yeah, I remember.
Come with us, sweetie.
This is a really cool car.
What I' m trying to tell you... is that it takes a lot... of the good American old green stuff to make one of these things, you know?
You got your lights, your sound, your lab costs... you got devloping, your synching, your editing.
Before you turn around... you' ve spent maybe 20, 25, 30 thousand dollars on a movie.
That' s a lot.
You bet your ass it is.
But if you make a good one... there' s practically no end to how much money you can make.
Have you seen Jack' s house?
He will.
He' il see it.
You got maybe 15, 20 guys standing around just... making sure that your lighting is right.
But you can work out in the morning, you can work out at noon, at night.
It doesn' t matter.
If you don' t have those juices flowing in the Mr. Torpedo area... in the Fun Zone.
But you must get people in the theater.
You need the big dicks, the big tits...
Here we go.
How do you keep them in the theater after they' ve come?
With beauty... and with acting.
I understand you' ve got to get them in the theater... keep the seats full.
But I don' t want to make a film... where they sit down, jack- off... and they get up and get out before the story ends.
It is my dream, it is my goal... it is my idea to make a film... that the story just sucks them in... and when they spurt out that joy- juice, they just got to sit in it.
They can' t move... until they find out how the story ends.
I want to make a film like that.
And that' s fine.
But it' s my dream... to make a film... that is true... and right... and dramatic.
You want a Fresca?
No thanks.
Are you sure?
You' re out of limes, Jack.
Check in the kitchen, darling.
I' m going to bed.
Good night, Jackie.
Don' t stay up too late.
Good night, beauty.
Good night, Eddie.
Glad you came by.
You' re great.
Thank you.
She' s the best.
She' s a wonderful mother.
She' s a mother to all those who need love.
She' s really nice.
You know what I' m thinking?
I want to be in business with you.
Really?
What do you think?
I' d love it.
What do you think of Rollergirl?
She' s great.
Would you like to do it?
Have sex?
Yeah.
Yeah, I' d love to.
She' s really foxy.
You bet your ass it is.
You' re officially out of limes.
I' il pick up some for you tomorrow.
Come here, darling.
I want you to get over there and sit on the couch with Eddie.
Here we go.
Are we going to fuck?
Oh, yes.
Wait a minute.
Are you ready?
Yeah, are you?
You taking your skates off?.
I don' t take my skates off.
And don' t fucking come in me.
Aim it at her tits, Eddie.
Hi.
Where were you?
Nowhere.
Where were you?
You see that little slut- girl?
Sheryl Lynn?
Don' t say that.
Make you feel like a stud to see trash like that?
Is she your girlfriend?
No, she' s not...
She' s a whore and a piece of trash.
I know you' re not the only one she sees.
Why would you say that?
I heard things about that girl.
I know what goes on when I' m not here!
I wash your sheets.
Or you doing something else in there with your music and your posters?
What is your problem?
Sheryl Lynn.
Go to your little girlfriend.
Maybe I will!
What will you do?
Something!
You can' t do anything!
You' re a loser!
You' il always be a loser!
You were too stupid to finish high school!
What' il you do?
I' il go somewhere!
Maybe I' il run away where you can never find me!
Fine!
Fuck that girl!
What are you doing?
I' m getting my stuff.
That' s not your stuff!.
You didn' t pay for it!
You didn' t pay for it, stupid!
None of this is yours!
You leave here, you leave with what you' ve got!
Nothing!
Nothing!
You understand me?
You want to treat me like this?
Is that fair?
I didn' t do anything!
Fuck that little whore!
You think you' re going to be this... goddamn poster?!
Don' t do that!
Why are you doing that?
You won' t be shit!
You' re too stupid!
I' m not!
Don' t be mean to me!
I am not being mean to you!
You' re too stupid to see it!
You don' t know what I can do or what I' m going to be!
I have good things that you don' t know about!
I' m going to be something!
Don' t tell me I' m not!
Don' t be mean!
No!
Shit.
Eddie Adams from Torrance.
I knew you' d make it.
You take the bus here?
It wasn' t bad.
How are you?
Great.
I got people I want you to meet.
Do you like music?
I love music.
What kind?
All kinds.
Rock, jazz, classical.
I want you to meet some great people.
Buck and Becky.
Buck Swope.
Nice to meet you.
Our new fella.
Becky Barnett.
Nice to meet you.
This is the new fella?
Is that a faccia?
That is a faccia.
Faccia' s "face"?
That' s right.
Take care.
Great people.
He' s one hell of an actor.
I want you to meet the new boy on the street.
Hi, Eddie.
Reed Rothchild.
Stick around for a while, okay?
Sure.
Make him something special.
You live on the street?
I thought Jack just said you did.
Want a drink?
Margarita?
Two... four, whatever.
Can I ask you something?
Do you work out?
You look like it.
What do you squat.
About two.
Super, super.
What about you?
What do you squat?
350.
No BS.
That' s a lot.
Where do you work out?
In Torrance, where I live.
Cool.
Cool.
You ever go to Vince' s out here?
Oh, no.
I would' ve seen you.
I' m there everyday.
Always wanted to work out at Vince' s.
Cool.
Here.
Taste that.
Rock and roll!
Did you see Star Wars?
About 4 times.
People tell me I look like Han Solo.
Really?
What do you bench?
You tell first.
I asked you first.
Same time.
Cool.
Are you ready?
One... two... three.
You didn' t say anything.
Neither did you.
Hey guys, look at me.
Thank you, Johnny.
My dear, it' s party time.
You do look lovely.
Hello, Colonel.
How are you?
Oh hello, Jack.
This is my lady friend.
Darling, meet Jack Horner.
The finest director in the business.
Do you nave any coke at this party?
I' m sure they can find some somewhere.
Great.
You' re no bigger than a minute.
I' il bet.
He has a right to tell me how to sell stereos.
It' s his store.
But he doesn' t have the right to tell me how to dress.
Baby, it' s just plain old.
Let me tell you something.
First, he was pissed about the music.
What' s wrong with it?
And the cowboy look ended 6 years ago.
It' s coming back.
No, it' s not.
It' s dead.
You don' t know.
I do.
And it sounds like your bosses at the store are saying the same thing.
What?
What?
You have to get a new look!
What?
You get a new look!
The look I have is just fine.
What is your look?
Chocolate love, all right?
Take a pill.
100o/ 0.
I' m just trying to be your friend.
Drop it.
I tried opening up a club here.
But I' m just this poor brother from Puerto Rico.
I got this club, that' s one thing.
But soon that goes, I die and what do I have?
I got nothing.
I want something I can send home.
Something I can send to my brother and say:
"Look at me.
Look at me and all the beautiful women I' ve been with. "
So, what?
You want me to talk to Jack?
Yeah.
I mean, what am I asking you here?
Honey, baby, please, talk to Jack.
Tell him I can do this.
I won' t be bad.
You want to be in a movie?
Baby, please.
I' il see what I can do.
Thank you.
Thank you, mamita.
Maurice, can I talk to you?
I need to talk you now.
Excuse me.
Can I join in?
Certainly.
Your cowboy... That' s not dead.
Then what the fuck is Becky talking about?
She' s got a fucking something up her ass.
Fuck that shit.
Bitch.
Do a cannonball!
No, no.
Watch this jackknife!
Did I look cool?
Pretty good.
I' il show you what you did wrong.
Full flip.
You all right?
You have to bring your legs all the way around.
I know.
I know.
This is my point.
You know what I' m saying?
Wear what you dig.
Just wear what you dig.
That' s what I say.
What' s the problem?
Should I get that?
Hello.
Can you speak a little louder, please?
A who?
A Maggie?
Do you know a Maggie?
I don' t.
There' s no Maggie here.
Your mother?
Just give me a second.
Watch that for me, okay?
Excuse me, is there a Maggie here?
Are you Maggie?
You' re not?
Are you Maggie?
Do you know Maggie?
Oh, man, can you believe that?
Hello?
I' m sorry, there' s no Maggie here.
No, no, it' s not a problem.
Okay, ciao.
Who was it?
Some kid looking for his mom.
What are you doing?
What' s it look like?
That' s my wife.
Shut up, Bill.
You' re embarrassing me.
Yeah, Little Bill, shut up.
Kurt, how' s it going?
What' s wrong with you?
My fucking wife, man.
She' s down there, some idiot' s dick in her.
Everybody' s watching.
It' s an embarrassment!
I know.
Anyway, listen.
For the shoot, I want to see about getting this new zoom lens.
I was wondering if we' d be able to get more lights too.
Jack wants a minimal thing.
Very often, minimal means a lot more photographically than people understand.
I understand.
I know you understand.
I mean other people.
I think what Jack is talking about is minimal.
Not natural, but minimal.
Okay, fine.
I understand.
I want to give each film its own look.
Can we talk about this later?
You got to go somewhere or...
Yeah.
No, I mean...
I was hoping, for the shoot tomorrow, we could send Rocky down to pick it up.
No, got you.
You got to go somewhere.
So what the fuck?
It' s only the photography of the film.
Are you giving me shit?
No.
No way, Little Bill.
My fucking wife has an ass in her cock in the driveway!
All right?
I' m sorry if my thoughts are not on the photography of the film!
No big deal.
Sorry.
Got you.
All right, where is it?
She' s sick.
What the fuck is this?
I didn' t do anything?
Is she breathing?
I don' t know.
Maybe she did too much coke.
Do you think so, doctor?
The girl' s definitely OD' ed.
Fuck me.
I want you to handle this for me, Johnny.
You listening?
Drive her to Saint Joe' s.
Drop her off in the front.
Understand me?
Got you.
Make sure no one sees the limo.
What is this?
This is twice in 2 days that a chick has OD' ed on me!
Think it means you should think about getting new shit?
Yes sir.
Shit, she' s freaking out!
With all this conversation!
Come on!
Please don' t die!
Back door, Johnny.
You got it.
Fucking shit!
Get out of my way.
Bart is she all right?
Shut the fuck up!
Scotty J., how are you?
You know, you know.
Who' s this?
Eddie, this is Scotty J.
He works on some of the films.
Nice to meet you.
Me too.
Are you going to be working or...
Maybe.
Probably.
That' s great.
How' d you meet Jack?
Because I work on the films.
Sometimes.
So, if you ever...
That' s the boy.
Could you excuse me for a minute?
Very nice to meet you.
Take care.
Eddie Adams, this is the Colonel.
How do you do?
Eddie is interested in film.
I can' t give you much advice that Jack doesn' t know... but I can advise you to think about your name.
My name?
Think about some name that makes you happy, or... something with a little pizazz.
The Colonel here, he puts up all the money for our films.
It' s an important part of the process.
Great, great.
I look forward to seeing you in action.
Jack says you have a big cock.
Well, I don' t know.
I guess so.
May I see it?
Really?
Please.
Thank you, Eddie.
No problem.
Thanks, Eddie.
You want to hear a poem I wrote?
"I love you
You love me
Going down the sugar tree.
We' il go down the sugar tree
And see lots of bees
Playing
Playing
But the bees won' t sting
Because you love me. "
That' s it.
Great.
You write that?
Yeah.
I write songs too.
How' s it going, boys?
Good time?
Excellent.
It was a great party.
The best.
That' s what Jackie' s house is for.
Right?
That' s right!
How about bubbles, Reed?
Excuse me, Jack?
I was thinking about what the Colonel said about my name.
Do you have any ideas?
I had some thoughts.
What do you think?
I want it so it can cut glass.
Razor sharp.
Razor sharp, right.
When I close my eyes, I see this thing, like this big sign.
And the name is in bright blue neon lights with purple outline.
It just blows up because the name is just so powerful.
It says "Dirk Diggler."
I think heaven has sent you here,
Dirk Diggler.
I think the angels have blessed us all because of you.
You' re Dirk!
Dirk Diggler!
Amen!
Talk to me, Kurt.
20 to 30.
Why?
I got tough shadows to deal with.
There' s shadows in life, babe.
You want to go over this?
The set- up is...
Here we go.
One:
Amber and Becky telephone the agents to send over some actors.
Two: enter Reed to audition for Amber.
Becky watches.
Three:
Becky goes to the bathroom to jack- off.
She gets interrupted by Amber, they go at it.
Four...
Who' s Dirk Diggler?
That' s that new good- looking kid, Eddie, at the club.
Good name.
Anyway, enter Dirk.
He meets Becky, they go at it.
No.
Change that, will you?
I want Eddie to be auditioning for Amber.
Got it.
Darling?
Where you going?
To wash my vagina.
How long will you be?
2 seconds.
You want it clean, don' t you?
I' m back now.
I' m ready to start my...
I' m supposed to come get you now and tell you they' re all ready now.
Do you think you could give me a minute?
Thanks.
I' m back now.
I' m ready to start my acting career.
That' s right.
You look really good.
And you look really sexy.
I like your name a lot.
You do?
It' s really cool.
You' il be right down there.
How' s my boy?
Great!
Let' s do it.
Remember what we talked about?
You' re going to come through the door, walk right over here.
"Action, Eddie." That' il be your cue, right?
You enter, you walk right over here to the desk to Amber and... we shoot.
Do we go right into the sex or...
Is that all right?
Is that okay with you?
Good.
You don' t need a rehearsal?
I can do it.
We' il shoot the rehearsal.
Could I ask you something?
I was wondering if you could call me Dirk Diggler from now on?
I' m sorry.
No, it' s all right.
From now on.
Let' s get a good one.
Want to practice your lines?
No, I know it.
You look great, honey.
Does he want me to keep going until I come?
Yeah, come when you' re ready.
Where?
Where do you want?
Wherever you tell me.
Come on my tits if you can, okay?
Pull it out and do it on my stomach and my tits, if you can.
No problem.
Are you all right, honey?
This is great.
I just want to do good.
I want it to be really good.
I was wondering,
Great.
You all right?
Enter through this door.
"Action," that' s your cue.
You got the lines for the scene?
If you drop one, call for it.
Okay?
Want some water or something?
I' m fine.
You' il do fine.
Roll it, Scotty.
Speed.
Sticks.
Marker.
Camera' s set.
We' re ready, Chief.
And... action, Dirk.
Hello.
Are you John?
Yes, ma' am.
Your agency recommends you very highly.
I' m a hard worker.
If you give me a job, I won' t disappoint you.
What special skills do you have?
I' ve been in the Marines for three years.
I just got back from a tour of duty.
You' re kidding.
I' m not.
And it got really hard being surrounded by all those guys all day.
How long since you had a woman?
A long time.
That' s terrible.
But now I' m back, and I' m ready to pursue my acting career.
As you may or may not know, this is an important film for me.
If it' s not a hit, I' il get kicked out of my apartment.
My landlord' s a jerk.
Really?
Take your pants off.
It' s important I get an idea of your size.
No problem.
I think that you have the job, but why don' t I make sure of something?
This is a giant cock.
Little Bill, we' ve rolled out.
We got to change mags.
Do it quickly.
Is everything cool?
We just got to change the angle.
Does it look sexy?
It' s great.
You' re doing so good.
Does it feel good?
Roll sound, Scotty.
Speed.
Quiet.
Sticks.
Action, kids.
Okay, we' re going to go down now.
John, you' re a wonderful actor.
You' re a wonderful actor!
You' re amazing.
You feel so good.
Are you ready to come?
Come in me.
Don' t worry.
I want you to come in me.
Oh, God!
Wonderful.
Cut!
Terrific!
Nice work!
Was it sexy?
Rock and roll!
Really good!
Doesn' t he fuck like a champ?
He rocks.
The camera loves you.
I didn' t get the come shot.
We missed the come shot.
He came inside her.
Maybe we could go to stock footage.
Are you crazy?
It won' t match.
I could do it again if you need a close- up.
Here we go.
Everyone say, "Dirk!"
There are real wood.
These are great.
Those are cool Are they lizard?
No, they' re Italian.
I' m going to fucking buy these.
Guys?
It' s funny you say that because we should be in a band.
You like my shoes?
Pretty cool.
I got them with Reed and Scotty.
They' re cool.
They' re embossed leather with this patchwork reptilian- pattern design.
Can we have some hot sauce?
Want to sit down and help yourself?.
Say hello to Jaime Lynn.
Scotty.
So, you' re a Leo?
My girlfriend wants to meet you.
This is Raymond.
What' s your name?
Excuse me?
Becky Barnett!
Raymond' s a Leo.
I knew it.
What' s your sign?
I' m a Pisces.
What?
I can' t deal with no Pisces.
That shirt' s pretty sexy.
This is, like, imported Italian nylon.
And it' s, like, a special edition limited silk print.
And it was done by this really famous... design artist from Italy.
Pick a card.
What' s up, baby?
I love you!
I' m going to cut the deck one time, all right?
Now I' m going to make your card rise from the deck.
Damn!
2 of diamonds, right?
That' s my card!
But doesn' t it make you nervous when you' re dealing with those evil forces?
Horses?
What?
No, the evil forces!
Evil?
No, man, it' s not evil.
It' s an illusion.
Yeah, it' s confusing.
Thank you.
We' re going to try and do this all in one shit!
So, we start like this, and then you roll her over, Dirk.
Roll with him, but try to give me every single position.
Is that possible?
Rollergirl, if you wrap your leg around... No, the left one.
Good.
See, we can go right into doggy- style.
Perfect.
Is the movement on the waterbed a problem?
No, not at all, Kurt, I dig it.
It' s great.
Okay, can we do this?
Yeah.
All right, everybody.
Here we go.
This is going to be great.
Do you want me to use the Spanish accent?
"Jack Horner has found something special in newcomer Dirk Diggler."
It' s another stellar sexual standout from Horner and Company.
Digger delivers a performance worth a thousand hard- ons.
His presence when dressed is powerful and demanding. "
Diggler' s more eruptive than a volcano on a bad day. "
"Amber Waves' cherry lips do a great job of handling Diggler' s wide load..."
"Rocking Reed Rothchild' s stiff biceps do a slapping good job... job with Becky Barnett' s supple ass."
"But it' s Dirk Diggler that remains the stand- out in this film.
It' s easy to predict after only 2 films
Diggler' s suck- cess can only grow... and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow and grow. "
What else?
That' s it for now.
Look at the character Holmes came up with.
And look, I just...
Tell me.
I don' t like seeing women treated that way.
The guy who plays Johnny Wadd.
It' s always about slapping a girl around.
It' s not right.
It' s not cool.
It' s just not sexy.
It' s not sexy like it should be.
The guy' s more like a James Bond- type character.
You know, he' s classy.
He' s a world- traveled guy.
I like that.
Reed could play my partner.
I like that a lot.
We could make it really good, Jack.
Honestly, if you direct it, we make a whole series with a whole story.
It' s exactly what we' ve always talked about.
Please.
When we get back... set up the typewriter.
We' il see what comes out of it.
But I have to talk to the Colonel when we get to Vegas.
You must work on the Colonel too, you must be committed.
Right, right, Jack.
I' il do whatever I have to do.
Does this character have a name?
His name is "Brock Landers."
And his partner' s name is "Chest Rockwell."
Those are great names!
And the award for "Best NewComer" goes to... yes, my baby boy, Dirk Diggler!
And the award for "Best Cock" goes to... and here we go again, Dirk Diggler!
The award for "Best Actor" goes to...
I' ve seen all his movies and I can' t wait to work with him!
Mr. Dirk Diggler!
I don' t know what to say.
I guess the only thing I can say is...
I' il promise to keep rocking and rolling and making better films.
You know, it seems we makes these movies... and sometimes they' re considered filthy or something by some people.
But I don' t think that' s true.
These movies we make, they can be better.
They can help, they really can.
I mean that!
We can always do better.
I' m going to keep trying, if you guys keep trying.
Let' s keep rocking and rolling.
Shot of tequila, straight up.
Yes, ma' am.
I' ve been in this place for 20 minutes just to get a seat.
Are you alone?
Yeah.
Just visiting LA.
Some people told me the food in here was really good.
It' s not good.
It' s the best place to eat in all of LA.
It' s excellent.
I hope so.
I could die of starvation before I get something in my mouth.
Still hungry?
Starving.
Why don' t you feast on that.
Oh, it' s true.
What' s that?
You are Brock Landers.
Freeze!
Don' t make me chase you, Raphael!
Freeze!
We' re almost there.
I want you to trim the head.
Take the shot of Reed with the revolver.
Just dump it and switch the title card.
I want it to come flying out of the screen at the audience.
Piece of cake.
That' s my guy.
I told him, this is a special party for Scotty J.
I want your lightest, bubbliest champagne.
This is what he gave me.
Take a sip of this and tell me what you think.
This is supposed to be really good stuff.
Here, take a sip.
Is that pretty light?
Yeah, that is.
What do you think?
It' s beautiful!
Look how spacious it is.
I like these.
That' s custom made.
That' s real Italian leather.
Watch this.
What' s that?
My initials.
That' s imaginative!
How' d you think of that?
I was thinking of my name and dreamt it up.
I' m almost finished.
It looks great.
I used a little poetic license to capture your essence.
It looks great.
It' s a good piece for conversation.
It' s really neat.
Jesse did all that oil painting as well.
Buck is still installing the stereo.
And that lamp... those are real sterling silver.
It' s a very interesting room.
It has a very modern feel too.
Watch this.
You ready?
Can' t wait to see it.
It' s my dojo.
An Asian room!
It has that whole karate feel.
It' s very comfortable.
Yeah.
A lot of ancient China.
I have my statues for my Best Actor awards.
A good place to keep your awards.
Look up there.
Oh, that' s handy.
Can you see yourself?.
Yeah.
It' s great, huh?
It' s my whole, entire wardrobe.
It' s all perfectly organized for me by color as well as designer.
You don' t have to think about it or anything.
You' il love it.
This is my favorite thing in the world.
Close your eyes.
Okay, you ready?
Yeah, baby.
Isn' t it beautiful?
Oh, God.
This is it.
This is the thing.
You deserve this, baby.
Isn' t it great?
This is the most beautiful thing I' ve ever seen.
Want to go for a ride?
Oh, yeah!
She rocks!
Hold on!
You set us up, Chico.
Fuck with Raphael and Ringo, that' s your business.
You know what?
You' re not even worth it!
I gave you a chance!
I trusted him.
Well, we almost solved the case.
At least the women are safe.
Let' s go get some of that Saturday night beaver.
No one fucks with Chest and Brock.
This is the best work we' ve ever done.
It' s a real film, Jack.
It feels good.
You made it fly.
I want them to remember me by.
Thank you.
As far as I' m concerned, it' s all about love.
You know what I mean?
If you love someone, how hard can the world be?
I mean, it is just deep down in your soul... what' s a problem that takes your attention away from that?
Do you understand?
I' m Becky Barnett.
Jerome.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too, Becky.
So, what do you do?
I' m in the auto industry.
I' m a regional manager over at Pep Boys.
That' s great, that' s great.
You' ve got a really nice smile, Becky.
Thank you...
Jerome.
The Colonel.
Floyd Gondolli!
Great you could make it.
Great, great!
How are you?
You look happy.
I' m fine.
Meet boys, Tommy, Pete.
Meet girls, Cyndi, Angie.
These are the next stars.
There are the real people in the world.
I think we ought to talk to Jack.
Iron this thing out before the new year?
Let' s do it.
But what were you thinking?
What were you feeling?
Did you do research?
What are you talking about here?
Oh, nothing.
Want to come with me for a while?
Where?
It' s a surprise, surprise, surprise.
Yeah, let' s go.
Excuse me, Jessie.
Hey, Buck.
Hey, Jessie.
How you doing?
Are you sitting alone?
Yes.
Todd Parker!
Rocking Reed Rothchild!
You made it!
It' s an amazing party.
Fucking chicks everywhere.
You bet.
Courtesy of Jack Horner, thank you.
I wouldn' t mind me having a piece of that action over there.
Michelle.
I' il introduce you.
Sure.
Introduce her to my lap.
Did you get off work?
Don' t dance Sunday nights.
Who' s Vette is that in the driveway?
Dirk.
I' m jealous of him.
That shit' s jamming.
3 1/ 4 horsepower, 4 speed, 4- 10 gears... 10 coats of orange, hand- rubbed lacquer with a dual- plane manifold.
Full fucking race cams.
I' m pretty happy with it, you know?
It' s a great look for you, I think.
It' s pretty original, you know, I think.
Take this off.
What were we talking about before?
Oil painting?
No.
I mean, but I was saying that...
Sunsets!
Right, yeah.
I was saying that I love sunsets.
But sunrises are better.
Exactly.
I thought I was the only one who felt that way.
No, I feel that way.
Really?
Yes really.
Have you heard my stereo system?
No.
I' m going to open my own business.
Yes.
It' s my dream, okay?
It' s hi- fi stereo equipment at discount prices.
It' s called "Buck' s Super Stereo World."
That is a fucking great idea.
You know, in the 80' s that' s when it' s going to happen.
For real.
Really?
Yes, really.
In the 80' s.
I wanted you to come in so I could tell you how much I love you.
It' il be a new year and we' re going to start things, and do things... and I just wanted you to know how much I care about you.
I really care about you, honey.
You' re my little baby.
You' re the best thing that' s happened to me since my son went off.
I love you, honey.
I love you, too.
Fucking 1980, you know?
Can you believe it?
I can' t.
The next thing you know it' s going to be...
Can you imagine?
Hello 1980.
Make sure you snort it back real quick and hard.
Like this.
It burns.
It' s good though, right?
It' s going in my throat.
The drip' s the best part.
It tastes like aspirin.
Do one more in the other nostril.
I need a drink of water.
One more and then a drink of water.
Do you think I look cool when I do it?
So let' s talk about the future.
Let' s talk about what video means to this industry.
Let' s talk about how all of us, not one of us, how all of us will profit.
Now, I' ve been doing theater in San Francisco and San Diego...
As long as you' ve been doing stag and hardcore.
We' re all familiar with your biography, Floyd.
No one is doubting your credentials or your history.
Then why the resistance?
This industry will be turned upside- down soon enough.
Why help it?
Why not be prepared?
Colonel' s got money.
You got talent.
I got the equipment and distribution.
Not to mention those kids out there... who are hot fuck action to the max, Jack.
This is the future.
Videotape tells the truth.
You come into my house, my party, to tell me about the future?
And the future is tape, videotape, and not film?
That it' s amateurs, not professionals?
I' m a filmmaker.
That' s why I' il never make a movie on videotape.
I' il tell you something.
I will never loan out any of the actors under contract to me.
Wait a minute, Jack.
I' m not a complicated man.
I like cinema.
In particular, I like to see people fucking on film.
But I don' t want to win an Oscar or re- invent the wheel.
I like simple pleasures like butter in my ass and lollipops in my mouth.
That' s something I enjoy.
Call me crazy, call me a pervert.
But there is one thing that I want to do in this life.
And that is, I want to make a dollar and a cent in this business.
I' m not trying to hurt you.
I' m trying to help you stay ahead of the game.
We' re going in circles now.
We' re in familiar territory.
The territory we' re in is the future.
Not to mention the cost.
You know, if it looks like shit, and it sounds like shit, then it must be shit!
You' re holding on too tight, Jack.
It doesn' t have to look good.
Film is just too damn expensive.
And theaters are already converting to video projectors.
I haven' t heard that.
Well, it' s true.
Ten minutes before the new year.
I' d like to spend it with my friends.
We will or will not continue this conversation.
Hey, Scotty.
What' s up?
Fucking New Year' s, right?
1980.
Oh, man!
Did you see my new car?
Got a new car?
Want to see?
Cool.
It' s out front.
Come on.
I want you to meet my friend Todd.
Todd Parker, Dirk Diggler.
What' s up, man?
How are you?
We finally meet.
I was telling you about him before.
You remember?
Todd Parker?
He works at Party Boys Strip Club?
Cool.
You' re a dancer.
Yeah, I got some moves.
You coming or you want to talk to these guys?
I' il be around in a little bit and we can talk then, okay?
See you later, Reed.
When you get my the lights, close your eyes.
Just follow my voice.
Here, here, here, here, here.
It' s cool!
You want to get inside?
When did you get it?
Yesterday.
I had it painted yesterday, so the paint might be kind of sticky.
This is great, man!
You want to go for a ride?
Wait, wait!
Fuck!
Hell, how much time is left?
I' m sorry.
What the hell is the matter with you?
Why did you do that, Scotty?
You look at me sometimes.
I want to know if you like me.
Yeah, I like you, Scotty.
Can I kiss you?
Please, can I kiss you on the mouth?
Please let me?
Look, I' m really sorry.
I didn' t mean to grab you like that or scare you.
Do you want to kiss me?
What' s the matter with you?
Forget it.
I' m really drunk.
I' m out of my head.
Really, Dirk.
I' m really just wasted.
I' m crazy right now.
I' m really crazy.
Do you want to go back inside?
Do you like my car, Dirk?
What?
I wanted to make sure you thought it was cool or else I' d take it back.
It' s great.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year, Scotty.
I really love you.
I love you too, Scotty.
Let' s go back inside, okay?
Idiot!
I' m a fucking idiot.
I' m a fucking idiot.
Let' s go!
Two minutes!
Come on, Little Bill!
Little Bill, smile, man!
Little Bill, champagne?
That' s nice of you.
Happy New Year.
To you too.
Kurt, have you seen my wife?
They' re doing the countdown thing.
Come on in, man.
Hey, Little Bill, look at me.
10... 9... 8... 7... 6, 5, 4... 3... 2...
What the fuck was that?
Where' s Jack?
And what people may consider violent attitudes towards women?
Violence?
No!
I mean, if there' s a certain amount of... violence or action in this series of film, that' s the movie.
If Brock Landers is slick with a gun... he does so in the vein of good.
Brock protects the values of the American ideal, and fights for causes that instill pride in a society where morals are hard to come by.
Who sent you?
Get the fuck off me, asshole.
Lie still or I' il punch you in the face!
Fuck off!.
I' il find out who sent you.
Amber, I live in this world.
I don' t like violence any more than you do.
Violence is a bad thing.
But when you see violence in films...
No more films.
That' s fine.
I' il fuck on my own time.
You know, I got other interests.
I' m a magician.
I focus on in the future.
You can' t fuck forever.
I realize that.
Violence... is something that plagues us as a society.
Well, the fine line is, I' m playing a character.
I mean, I' m Dirk Diggler.
Brock Landers is a character that I' m playing.
I' il ask you again, and I' il ask nice.
Where the fuck is Ringo, you bitch?
Fuck you.
Why do I love him?
He' s very special.
He can fuck hard or he can fuck really gently.
He' s the best.
I think that' s... part of my reason for doing this.
I' ve gotten thousands upon thousands of letters... from people telling me, "God, you' ve taught me this and... you' ve made our love life so much better."
This isn' t "Go out and have sex with ten million people."
"How to get a girl off." It' s how to get your wife off.
If only people could have been doing this before, we could have saved a million relationships.
I' ve saved thousands.
Blocking an idea or movement.
Jack' il put the final touches together for what the camera needs for editing.
But he allows me to block my own sex scenes and gives me the freedom to develop the character and stuff like that.
I don' t know any other director who would let an actor... do that.
I don' t allow him to block his own sex scenes.
It is.
It' s jealousy... it' s deceitfulness, it' s vindictiveness.
But, God, what can you expect when you' re on top.
It' s like Napoleon, when he was the king... people were constantly trying to conquer him... in the Roman Empire.
It' s history repeating itself all over again.
To all the critics out there, I know they' il be reviewing this.
I know they' il try to knock me.
I want them to know -- Can I say this into the camera?
Sure.
I only am who I am because I was born that way.
I have a gift... and I am trying to not be selfish about it, but to use it.
And if you want to knock me for that, it' s your own problem.
Jealousy will get you nowhere.
I' m going to keep rocking on.
For Dirk Diggler, the future is something to look forward to, not to fear.
He' s a creative man of many interests:
Film, poetry, karate, music and dance.
He is a man of passion and mystery.
He is a man of lust.
It' s my poem to you.
It' s really good.
You' re like a director now.
Have you shown Jack yet?
I wanted you to be the first.
It' s really good, Amber.
Congratulations.
Thanks, baby.
You might want to think about cutting the part where Jack talks about...
About blocking the sex?
That stuff about me not being a black belt is not true.
Yeah, I can fix that.
How' d it turn out?
What?
Slow down.
Guys, guys, guys!
Slow down, Colonel.
Say again?
I' il be right there...
So...?
Let me tell you, Jack.
I don' t mean to laugh about it, but she was... 15 going on 150.
Believe me.
I mean, she was... You would never know it.
I was fooled completely.
I mean, I' ve had a few of them.
Anyhow...
You do believe me, don' t you?
Yeah, I believe you.
Anyway, so I take her home... and I got her there and...
I tell her not to do so much coke.
She must' ve done 20 lines in 5 minutes!
It' s like a vacuum in her nose.
Anyway, she' s got all this stuff going on.
Next thing you know, she stopped.
Something must have broken up there because blood poured everywhere.
Pouring out.
You thought she was older...
You didn' t do anything...
She was just at the...
She was at your place.
You didn' t do anything, right?
Nothing.
You didn' t do anything?
Not a thing.
You know me, Jack.
You didn' t do anything?
No, I didn' t do anything.
But they... foud something at the house.
What?
There' s something that' s...
Jack, it' s my fucking weakness.
They' re so small and they' re so cute, and they' re so adorable.
I just can' t help it when they' re so cute and adorable.
Jack, listen.
I don' t touch them, Jack.
Not in any way.
Honestly.
Jack, please!
Now you think I' m an asshole.
Jack, let me tell you this.
I love you, Jack.
I' m your friend.
There' s one thing I want you to do, though.
Jack, come on.
Tell me that you' d be my friend.
Just tell me, am I your friend?
Jack, am I your friend?
I do.
I do too.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
I' m dying to do a movie with you.
I know you are.
It' s such an important thing in my life.
I spoke to Jack.
You know, I spoke to him, but...
I tell you what comes to my mind.
What comes to mind is, I am the ultimate Latin lover.
There' s no Latin lover like me.
Once you get Maurice as the Latin lover...
That' s so great, you guys!
It' s a chance for me to run the store my way.
Get them off my back.
We' re getting a house.
Exactly!
I' m going to run the store my way.
Are you moving to Bakersfield?
Soon?
Aren' t you folks from Bakersfield?
You guys, we' re losing these two!
They' re moving to Bakersfield.
Big promotion.
You look at the movies and say, "Hell, I can do that."
I can do it.
It' s a little more complicated than that.
It' s a tough racket.
You made it.
How you doing?
Good.
Who' s that?
Hi.
I' m Johnny Doe.
You' re Dirk Diggler?
It' s great to meet you.
Johnny' s the new boy on the street.
He' s interested in show business.
He' s very tired.
He' s shy, you know?
So, I can tell you it' s a tough business.
You got a great kisser.
There' s a lot of work involved.
A lot of people.
We all have to work our buns off.
You know what I mean?
I mean, it takes 15, 16 guys just to... do the lighting.
This crystal, man, you just want to do bumps.
Shut up, man.
Hey, you guys.
What?
Just saying, "Hey."
Yeah, whatever.
You all right?
It' s getting me fucking high.
It' s that carpet dope.
It' s the kind of dope they used to put carpet in.
They' d mix it up in the bathtub.
While they' re mixing it they' d drop in a hunk of carpet into it.
It' s a lot better than that pink shit.
That pink shit' s weird.
They put fish scales in that shit.
Fuck.
You look good.
You' re ready.
You' re ready!
Come on.
You ready?
I' m born ready.
Come on.
I' m ready to shoot.
20 minutes.
No.
I' m ready now.
It' s got to be now.
20 minutes, babe.
No.
I' m ready to shoot.
My cock is ready.
Let' s go.
20 minutes.
I want to fuck.
Who' il it be?
Who do you want to start?
Me or him?
What?
Shut up, okay?
I didn' t do anything to you.
You' re not an actor!
You got no business here!
You' re not an actor.
Yes, I am!
Knock it off.
No!
I' m an actor, man.
I' m a real, fucking actor.
Shut up, man!
Stop this Mickey Mouse bullshit.
I want you to go in there.
I want you to cool off.
And we' il come back and shoot the scene.
I said I' m ready to shoot.
Not now.
I' m not going to tell you again, Jack.
I' m not going to shoot you in the state you' re in.
What do you mean "state"?
State of California?
I know where I am.
You' ve been up for two days.
I haven' t been up for two days!
Nevertheless, you look like you haven' t been to sleep.
I ain' t going to shoot you this way because you don' t look good.
You don' t tell me anything, okay?
Really?
You' re not the boss of me.
Yes.
You' re the king?
Yes.
Don' t you fucking touch me!
You shut up too!
You' re not the mother of me.
You' re not my boss.
You' re not my mom!
Honey, please don' t.
I' il take you home.
I' m ready to shoot the scene.
I' m fine.
I want you out of here!
It' s over.
I' m done.
Listen to me, kid...
Don' t you call me kid!
I' il fuck you up!
Want to see me kick some ass?
I know fucking karate!
You' re fucking fired!
You are fired!
You' re fired, you goddamn kid!
Son of a bitch!
No.
You know what?
I' m the biggest star here, man.
That' s the way it is.
I want to fuck, it' s my big dick, so everybody get ready fucking now!
You know what?
I don' t need this shit!
You know, fuck you!
Fuck all of you!
You' re not my boss!
You' re not the king of me!
I am the fucking king of Dirk!
You' re fucking nothing without me, Jack!
Fuck this man!
I don' t need this shit!
I' m so sorry.
I' il straighten him out.
Okay, Dirk, you ready?
I was born ready, Nick.
Let' s go, man.
Dirk Diggler demo.
"You Got the Touch." Take 7.
Excuse me, Reed.
You got the touch.
You got the power.
After all is said and done,
You never walk, you never run.
You' re a winner.
You' ve got the moves you know the streets.
Break the rules take the heat.
You' re nobody' s fool.
You' re at your best when the going gets rough.
You' ve been put to the test but it' s never enough.
You got the touch.
Think the bass is taking away from the vocal?
No, not really.
It sounds balanced to me.
It' s taking away from my vocal.
Take the bass down and bring up the vocal.
Let' s do it, Nick.
You heard him.
Want to take it from the top?
Yeah, let' s try it.
I think we should repeat that again.
It' s definitely cool.
Let' s lay it down.
Want to lay it down?
Were we rolling on that rehearsal?
Is he going to fuck me in the ass?
Is that what you want?
It would be nice.
Fuck her in the ass.
Jack.
I was going to take a pottery class at Everywoman' s Village..
I want to do that.
We' il do that.
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at three.
I was thinking something.
I was going to see about taking the GED.
Do you know what that is?
To graduate.
I feel bed.
I think you were right about that.
You should do it, Rollergirl.
Because you know what?
If you wanted to, you could do anything.
Have your loan application?
Yes, I do.
Good.
Do you want to follow me?
Are we going to have any other coverage on this?
We just keep shooting.
This is video.
We shoot and shoot, then we deal with it later.
Now, Summer, I want you to take Sky' s thong off.
That thong thing.
Yeah, actually take it off.
And finger it.
No, that' s good.
Lick the thong.
That' s really good technically... but it lacks passion.
I want to see some passion here.
Yes, bitch!
Yeah, that' s it.
Lick my balls.
Fuck me!
Who' s your daddy, bitch?
You' il live.
I' m back!
Perfect timing.
What the fuck took you so long, man?
That' s what Buck' s Super Stereo World is all about: the customer.
Because people want to know what they' re getting into technically.
I have the hi- fi background to answer any technical question they have.
I' ve been in sound equipment long enough... to know what a guy wants when he walks in.
That' s the personal touch that
Buck' s Super Stereo World will have.
I miss my two sons, you know?
I miss my little Andrew... and my Dirk.
I always felt like Dirk was... my baby.
My new baby.
Don' t you miss Dirk?
He' s so fucking talented, the bastard.
I love him, Rollergirl.
I really love the stupid jerk.
I love you, Mom.
I want you to be my mom, Amber.
Are you my mom?
I' il just ask you if you' re my mom, okay?
And you say "yes," okay?
Are you my mom?
Yes, honey, I am.
Hold on.
Come on.
All we need is the tapes, Burt.
No, you don' t get them until you pay.
In our situation that doesn' t make any fucking sense!
We can' t pay the price of the demo tapes unless we take the demo tapes to the record company and get paid!
Exactly!
That' s not an M. P., that' s a Y. P. Your problem!
Come up with the money and I' il give you the tapes.
You' re talking above my head.
I don' t know this industry jargon.
Okay?
All I know is that I cannot get a record contract.
We cannot get a contract... unless I take these tapes.
And granted, the tapes themselves are yours.
You own them, okay?
But the magic that is on the tapes... that heart and soul we put into those tapes, that is ours.
And you don' t own that.
Now, I need to take that magic and get it to the record company!
They' re waiting.
We were supposed to be there half an hour ago.
We look like assholes right now, man!
I don' t want to do this anymore.
I can' t.
Let' s have fun now.
Let' s just go and go.
Because it' s over.
There' s too many things.
Too many things.
Let' s go walk.
I don' t want to leave this room.
Me either!
I love you, honey.
I love you, Mom.
Let me explain to him... in simple arithmetic.
One, two, three.
Because you don' t fucking get it, Burt!
You give us the tapes, we get the record contract... we come and give you your money.
Have you heard the tapes?
We' re guaranteed a record deal.
Our stuff is that good.
We sculptured.
Now, I understand.
I know you want it to happen.
But it' s not going to happen.
Because it' s a "Catch 22" and that' s it.
What does that mean?
What is a "Catch 22"?
"Catch 22," gentlemen.
Think about it.
You know what I' m thinking about?
I' m thinking about kicking some fucking ass in here, man!
Scotty, get him out of here!
Thanks a lot of backing us up too.
Real good.
Fuck!
We can' t help you.
I have all the papers, though.
Yes?
Yes.
But we can' t give you a loan.
I' m sorry.
I don' t understand.
Why can' t you give me the loan?
Mr. Swope, you' re a pornographer.
The banks is not in business to support pornography.
I' m not a pornographer, though.
I' m an actor.
I' m sorry.
Look, this is a new business for me.
It' s a real thing that I want to do.
It' s a real thing that I can do.
Please!
I' m sorry.
We did everything right.
It' s okay.
Just wait a minute.
Let' s just take a minute, okay?
Look, you have something to say.
I have something to say.
All right?
So let' s just talk.
If there is something that I didn' t fill out correctly on this... or something that I left out, or that you want me to write on there just tell me what to write on there.
I' m sorry.
You' re not being fair!
This isn' t fair.
This financial institution cannot endorse pornography.
Stop saying that!
Why are you doing this?
I' m an actor!
I' m sorry.
I am an actor!
Who' s your daddy?
How is it?
What it is, what it is.
Suck that cock, bitch.
So, you must be Maggie?
Kathleen O' Malley.
I' m the judge.
You have a lawyer with you?
No, I don' t.
Hello, Judge.
Good morning, Counselor.
You' ve been divorced for 6 years?
Since 1977.
And the agreement on the money settlement has been taken care of?.
Yes.
What we' re talking about, then, is coming to an agreement on the custody... of Andrew.
What was decided on during the divorce?
Well, initially, Andrew was to go with his father... for visitation, with his mother... from Saturday noon to Sunday at seven.
With his mother entitled to bring Andrew to her house... or any reasonable place.
Was that the understanding?
Why wasn' t that visiting privilege honored, then?
For a while.
I only saw him twice.
It said, "reasonable place."
I don' t think that a house of drugs, prostitution and pornography was that.
I' m sorry?
My wife is in the pornography business.
I didn' t think that environment was safe for my son.
No, this is not right.
My son was never exposed to pornographic material, drugs or any of those things.
My husband just assumed...
I saw it with my own eye, Maggie.
Did you register a complaint?
My client didn' t officially register, Your Honor.
But I think the circumstances call for immediate action... for the safety of the child.
She' s a sick person, and she needs help.
She deals in sex and drugs for a living.
No, I don' t do drugs.
Your Honor, she has been in and out of trouble with the law... on several occasions for this sort of thing.
No.
Have you ever been arrested?
Yes.
When was the last time you were arrested... and what was the charge?
Okay, let' s get ready for this experiment.
Hi, Jack Horner here.
I' m in the back seat of this beautiful limousine, riding along west on Sherman Way.
And beside me... is a beautiful, talented, gorgeous young actress... from adult cinema, Miss Rollergirl.
Hi.
Hello.
Howdy.
Are you ready to get on with this experiment?
Ready like Freddy.
Yes.
That' s the name of this show.
On the lookout for a young stud... who, maybe, will get in the back seat here... and get it on with Rollergirl.
And we' re going to make film history... right here on videotape.
Hello.
Waiting for someone?
Yeah.
I' m waiting for somebody, but I' m not sure if they' re going to show up.
You want to wait in the car?
Cool.
I' m Joe.
Dirk.
You know who I am?
No.
My name' s Dirk Diggler.
No.
I' m just helping you out.
Yeah.
What do you see here?
Well, I see a girl.
Do you like what you see?
Yeah, I do.
All right.
Get in.
Get in... and let' s make film history.
What do you want to do?
It' s what you want to do.
I want to watch you.
I mean, I' m not gay, I just want to...
Maybe you could jerk off a little, and I could watch.
Maybe I' il join in later, but for now, I just want to watch.
20 bucks.
10 is all I have.
You go to school?
Yeah, I do.
Where do you go to school?
Is it okay if I don' t tell you?
Yeah, that' s cool.
You recognize Rollergirl from films?
Yes.
We watch her films a lot at my frat house.
I go to... I go to CSUN.
Wonderful!
The guys will never believe this.
We' ve done a whole bunch of films together, Rollergirl and I.
Do you remember me?
We went to school together.
Your name' s Brandy, right?
Brandy' s your name, right?
No.
I don' t know what you' re talking about.
Your name' s not Brandy?
Can you do it harder?
Faster, do it a little faster.
All right!
Now you' re hiding her again.
Just get on the other side.
That' s it.
Just nice and sexy, you know?
Now, listen pal!
You got to make it a little more sexy.
Don' t just ram it in there like that.
This is not a hole in the wall, pal.
This is Rollergirl.
Faster.
Do it faster.
Get your hand wet.
Be quiet.
Like that?
Cinematically sexy.
Just don' t ram it.
Be respectful.
This is Rollergirl.
Are you listening to me, kid?
I know what I' m doing.
This is stupid, Jack.
Okay.
That' s it.
Cut.
Pull over.
I can' t fucking believe this!
Jesus!
You gave me a hard- on.
The last you could do is jack me off.
What the fuck did you say?
I said it' s not that cool to leave me with a hard- on.
Well, fuck you!
I don' t fucking believe this.
A fine life you' ve made for yourself!.
You really should be proud.
I mean, really.
Fucker.
Fuck you!
And your fucking films suck now, anyway!
Come on!
I can' t.
I can' t get it hard, all right?
I' m sorry.
You just shouldn' t do this sort of thing, faggot.
Get out of the car, man!
Jesus, man.
Jack.
Get him out of the fucking truck, man!
You shouldn' t be coming down here!
Jesus Christ!
Get off him!
You like that?
Amateur fucker!
You don' t ever disrespect me.
You don' t ever disrespect me, you fucker!
Look at you now!
That' s what you get, faggot!
You think you can fuck?
You can' t fuck me, you fucker!
You can' t touch me, you fucker!
You don' t do this, donkey- dick.
You don' t!
Fucking faggot.
You don' t ever disrespect me, you fucker!
You fucking piece of shit!
Fucking die, you shithead!
What do you want?
I want an apple fritter, jelly... chocolate with sprinkles and... a bear claw too.
Okay.
Yeah.
And hurry.
How' s my little kung- fu fighter?
He' s kicking ass inside my stomach.
See, that' s a boy.
I' il be right back.
Can I help you?
Yeah.
I' m going to get a dozen.
Let me get a couple of bear claws.
Couple glazed.
Apple fritter!
Not that one.
The one in front.
Yeah, that one, that one.
Two chocolate.
Give me two of those.
Did you do this for the Christmas?
That' s cute.
Yeah, give me two of those... sprinkly Christmas things.
That' s great.
How many is that?
That' s eleven.
All right, empty the cash register now, motherfucker!
And hurry up!
Jesus Christ!
Shut the fuck up!
Hurry up with that shit!
No, motherfucker.
Empty the safe too, asshole!
And I ain' t got all night!
Don' t even move.
I' m not moving.
Shut up!
Don' t fucking move, man!
Shut the fuck up.
Don' t do that!
No, no!
You shut the fuck up!
All right, this could be the thing.
Something to help us score a little extra cash.
The guy' s name is Rahad Jackson.
He' s got more money than God.
He' s got twice as much coke, crank, and smack.
All right?
This guy' s going to buy about anything anybody wants to sell him.
He likes people hanging around his house, partying, the whole thing.
How do you know him?
He used to come to Party Boys, Mutrix introduced me.
How will we do it, exactly?
How would it all go down?
I' m going to call him on the phone, okay?
And I' m going to tell him I got a halfkey of quality stuff.
Do you have his phone number?
Yeah.
I' m going to call him.
I' m going to give him the price.
How much?
It' s half a key.
It' s like, 5000 bucks.
We' il split that up three ways.
It' s enough to get the Vette fixed.
That' s right, man.
We' re going to do the deal, we' il drop half a key of baking soda into a bag.
We' re going to walk over there, we' re going to...
Boom!
Right there.
This could be a nifty little bit of hustle- bustle.
Do you have his address?
Reed, yeah.
I got his fucking address.
Sorry.
Hold on.
What if he tests the stuff out?
He won' t.
How do you know?
Because I know he won' t.
I' m positive.
You guys should be careful.
What?
What do you mean?
Do me a favor, just mind your business.
What the fuck?
Sorry.
Anyway...
Dump it in there good and clean.
You can' t lay this all on me.
We' re going to go in there.
Okay, this is it.
Fine.
You guys ready for this?
I am.
Yeah.
I was born ready, man.
What the fuck is that?
A big gun.
No shit, but why?
Just in case.
Shit!
Fucking great!
You never said anything about a gun.
You have a gun too?
No, I don' t have a gun!
Relax.
Let' s just get in and out, all right?
Not too fast.
It looks suspicious.
Goddamn it!
You all right?
Let me do the talking.
Just be cool.
How you doing?
Come on in.
Hey, Rahad.
Hello, friends!
Which one is Todd?
That' s me.
At the Party Boys.
Come on in.
These are my friends here.
Dirk and Reed.
Come on in.
Glad to see you.
Take a seat.
You guys want a little pill, coke, dope?
I got everything.
Are you sure you don' t want something?
You got something?
We got something here?
There it is.
That' s about half a key there.
That' s quality.
You want to test it?
Don' t worry about him.
Go ahead, if you want to.
Wait a second.
I love this part.
Hear that build.
Fucking love that song!
So anyway, what' s the price?
Maybe, I don' t know...
Five grand.
Five grand?
That' s cool!
Five grand?
Five grand.
You guys want to play baseball?
No, thank you.
The black guy has a gun in his jacket.
Let' s get up and get the fuck out of here.
Count the money in the car.
You want to see something really fascinating?
Check it out.
That' s sweet.
That thing' s not loaded, is it?
Not yet.
Is that silver?
Let' s see what happens here?
Could you not point the gun?
You think I can' t do it?
You think I can' t do it?
You want to see me?
Do you dare me?
Please!
No, we don' t dare you!
Fucking dare me!
Your fucking faces, man.
What the fuck?
I love this thing.
I make these little mix tapes together.
I put all my favorite songs together.
I love it.
I fucking hate that.
I don' t like being told what to listen to, when to listen to it or anything!
Fuck it!
That' s Cosmo.
He' s Chinese.
That' s why he likes lighting off firecrackers.
Ricky Springfield.
He' s a buddy of mine!
Todd, we' re leaving, man.
Dirk, let' s go, all right?
We got to split.
Let' s hang out.
Let' s party.
We got somewhere else to go.
We' re not leaving yet.
We' re here now, and we want something else from you.
We want something else from you.
What?
Todd, what are you doing?
Let' s just go.
In the master bedroom... under the bed... in a floor safe.
Understand?
What the fuck is the matter with you?
Let' s go!
Shut up, Dirk!
I told you I got a plan.
I got a very good plan.
Are you kidding me, kitty?
See?
I' m not kidding.
I want what' s in the safe.
We want what is in the safe in the master badroom... in the fucking floor in the goddamn fucking floor safe!
That' s all.
Todd, don' t be crazy, okay?
We know nothing about this.
This is not what we wanted.
Shut the fuck up!
Do not reach for your gun, man!
Don' t reach for your gun!
He went in the bedroom!
What the fuck are you doing?
He went in the bedroom!
Todd, what the fuck did you go crazy?
He' s got coke and cash in that safe in that bedroom!
If we leave without it, we' re fucking idiots!
We came here to do something, and we can do it.
Are you with me?
Todd, listen to me!
Let' s just split right now!
This was not supposed to be the thing, Todd!
That' s what we goddamn came here to motherfucking do!
And that' s what I' m going to do now!
Fuck, no!
Todd, don' t!
Don' t be fucking stupid!
Go man!
Come on, you puppies!
It' s coming down for puppies!
Come on!
Puppies!
Come on!
Oh, shit!
Fucking son of a bitch!
Oh, fuck!
You fucking stupid motherfucker!
Oh, fuck!
Jack, could you please help me?
I guess
I wanted to come and say sorry, you know?
I just wanted to know if you could help me.
I need help.
I' m sorry, you know?
I need help, Jack.
I' m so sorry, Jack.
I' m sorry too, kid.
We all need to start again.
It' s okay.
You' re all right, baby.
One more.
Let' s go.
Please, 11.
Did I hear someone say "deal"?
This weekend, and this weekend only...
Buck' s Super Cool Stereo Store has super- cool deals on all name brands.
We' re open.
We' re ready.
All you need to do is walk over, get down and come inside us!
Cut!
Excellent.
Buck, honey, that was great.
I said shut up, Colonel!
Shut up, Colonel!
I said, "Shut up."
Wait, wait, wait!
No, that' s a "Q!"
That' s supposed to be a "G!"
Go!
What the heck?
Naughty, naughty, Candice.
You ready?
Let' s push.
Come on, baby.
Go, go, go!
Push, push, push!
I see a head here.
Fucking Christ!
No, don' t cuss, sweetie.
One more big push for me, all right?
Last big push for the doctor.
This is it.
Big push!
I got it.
He got it!
It' s a boy!
Sometime this year.
Put it where I told you to put it.
You' ve got to turn the fan on.
It smells good, doesn' t it?
No, it smells like shit.
This is Puerto Rican cooking.
Everybody' s complaining in the neighborhood.
Taste this.
I can' t taste it, not now.
I' il taste it later.
Rollergirl.
Honey, listen to me.
Move the dirt on one side of your to the other side.
One side of the room will look clean that used to look dirty.
It' il be good.
Johnny Weismuller!
That' s my swimmer!
Say "Hello, Uncle Jack."
Say "Hello, Uncle Jack."
Who is the Olympic- fever baby?
He won' t piss in the pool?
I don' t think so.
I got to talk to you about the stereo modification for this system.
No technical shit.
If you don' t get the modification, it won' t be loud...
I don' t want loud.
I want...
That' s what I want.
I want mellow.
Great, honey.
Great!
Are we ready?
We have got all the time we want.
What are you looking at?
I' m looking at you.
You' re staring.
You know what I' m staring at?
I' m staring at the foxiest bitch in the whole world.
"I' ve been around this block twice now.
I' m looking for something.
A clue.
I' ve been looking for clues and something led me back here.
Yeah.
So, here I am.
Could have been me that was the one at Ringo' s when the shit went down.
Hey, I know how it is.
I' ve been there.
We' ve all done bad things.
We' ve all had those guilty feelings in our heart.
You want to take your brain out of your head, wash it and make it clean.
But I' m going to help you settle this.
First, we' il check for holes, see what we can find.
Then we' re going to get nice and wet.
And you' re going to spread your legs.
That' s good.
So, you know
You know my reputation.
13 inches is a tough load.
I don' t treat you gently.
That' s right.
I' m Brock Landers.
So, I' m going to be nice.
So, I' m going to be nice.
I' m going to ask you one more time.
Where the fuck is Ringo? "
I am a star.
I' m a star.
I' m a star.
I' m a big, bright, shining star.
That' s right.
(Spanish) This one' s sick, don' t give him any!
(Spanish) Her!
Not her!
Her!
(Covey) I wanted to kill them too.
For they convinced some of us that they would take us back home.
Thank you, sir.
Mr Holabird.
Quite a tale.
Intrigue, abduction, courage in the face of unspeakable suffering.
And all true.
All right.
Now tell me if this is true.
Some tribes in Africa, for hundreds of years - thousands, perhaps - have owned slaves.
Translate.
Yes.
Under what circumstances might one become a slave among the Mende, of which you claim to belong?
Translate.
Wars, debts.
Oh, I see.
And how many men are indebted to you?
(Covey) I don' t think you do see.
Mr Holabird is trying to intimidate my colleague.
The Mende word for "slave" is closer to "worker".
Do these workers own the land they work on?
Do they receive wages?
Are these workers free to not work for you, if they so choose?
He' s questioning the translator!
The translator is answering for the witness.
- The witness isn' t getting a chance!
- Mr Baldwin!
Fine, Mr Baldwin!
Slavery, indentured servitude.
Whatever they want to call it, the concept is the same.
Now, he is familiar with the concept.
When you come down to it, it' s all about money, isn' t it?
Slaves, production, money.
I mean, that' s the idea of it.
Whether it' s here or there.
I' m confused.
Do your people routinely slaughter their slaves in the manner that you just so vividly described to us?
Of course they don' t.
What would be the point of that?
Killing your own slaves is like burning down your own house or hut, isn' t it?
How do you explain that paradox?
I don' t understand what you mean.
Sure you do.
As does everyone here.
The behaviour you attribute to your tormentors - your victims - and therefore every other aspect of your testimony, makes no sense.
- (Covey translates)
But thank you.
Like all good works of fiction, it was entertaining.
Nothing more.
(Baldwin) Captain Fitzgerald, please explain your duties in Her Majesty' s navy.
To patrol the Ivory Coast for slave ships.
Because?
Because slavery is banned in British law, sir.
Yet the abduction of men from the British protectorate of Sierra Leone and their illegal transportation as described by Cinque,
- is not unheard of, is it?
- Not even unusual, regrettably.
What, if anything, in his account of his ordeal, do you find believable?
His description of the slave fortress, for one thing.
There is such a place.
You' ve seen it?
No, sir.
We' ve not managed to locate it, but there is overwhelming evidence that it is real.
What evidence, exactly?
Rumour?
Reports.
By "reports" you mean of the variety Cinque shared with us today?
Its existence, sir, has been reported.
Cinque describes the cold- blooded murder of many of the people on board the Tecora.
Mr Holabird sees this as a paradox.
Do you, sir?
Often when slavers are intercepted, or believe they may be, they simply throw all their prisoners overboard and thereby rid themselves of the evidence of their crime.
- Drown hundreds of people?
- Yes.
It hardly seems a lucrative business to me, going to all that trouble rounding men up only to throw them overboard.
No, it' s very lucrative.
If only we could corroborate Cinque' s story somehow with... with evidence of some kind.
The inventory.
This?
From the Tecora?
If you look, there' s a notation made on May 10, correcting the number of slaves on board, reducing their number by 50.
(Baldwin) What does that mean?
I would say that it means this:
The crew greatly underestimated the amount of provisions required for their journey, and solved the problem by throwing 50 people overboard.
"This morning, we threw 50 slaves overboard."
On May 10 or any other day.
As of course you would not.
I do see that the cargo weight changed.
They reduced the poundage, I see, but that is all.
It' s simple, ghastly arithmetic.
Well, for you, perhaps.
I may need a quill and parchment and a better imagination.
And what poundage do you imagine the entry may refer to, sir?
A mast and sails, perhaps?
(Cinque) Give us... us... free.
Give... us... free.
Give us, us free.
Give... us... free.
Your Honour, please instruct the defendant not to disrupt proceedings with such outbursts.
Give us, us free!
If we are to have any semblance of order in court...
Give us, us free!
Give us, us free!
He cannot keep crying out "Give us free"...
Give us, us free!.. while I am questioning this witness!
GlVE US, US FREE!
GlVE US, US FREE!
(Mende) You don' t have to pretend to be interested in that.
Nobody' s watching but me.
I' m not pretending.
I' m beginning to understand it.
Their people have suffered more than ours.
Their lives were full of suffering.
Then he was born and everything changed.
Who is he?
I don' t know, but everywhere he goes he is followed by the sun.
Here he is healing people with his hands.
Protecting them...
Being given children...
What' s this?
He could also walk across the sea.
But then something happened.
He was captured.
Accused of some crime.
Here he is with his hands tied.
- He must have done something.
What did we do?
Whatever it was, it was serious enough to kill him for it.
Do you want to see how they killed him?
This is just a story, Yamba.
But look.
That' s not the end of it.
His people took his body down from this... thing... this...
(Mende) They took him into a cave.
They wrapped him in a cloth, like us.
They thought he was dead, but he appeared before his people again and spoke to them.
Then, finally... he rose into the sky.
This is where the soul goes when you die.
This is where we' re going when they kill us.
It doesn' t look so bad.
(Mende) Baukei...
Hold your head up.
(Bailiff) All rise.
After careful review and thorough reflection,
I find it impossible to deny the power of the government' s position.
Her Catholic Majesty, Isabella of Spain, and her trusted minister, Senor Calderon, have all proceeded with the utmost faith in the soundness of their case.
I also believe that Senors Ruiz and Montes may have... misrepresented the origin of the prisoners, an issue which weighs crucially upon their fate, and that of the Spaniards as well.
Were they born in Africa?
Since the answer to that question shall govern every determination of this court, I ask it again.
Were they born in Africa?
I believe they were.
As such, Her Catholic Majesty' s claims of ownership have no merit.
Neither do those for salvage made by Lieutenants Mead and Gedney.
I hereby order the arrest and detention of Senors Ruiz and Montes..
By federal marshals... on the charge of slave- trading!
The release of the Africans and their conveyance, by this government, at her earliest convenience and expense, back to their homes in Africa!
Yes!
We' ve done it, Joadson!
Yes!
Covey, tell them!
Tell them now!
Look at 'em!
What' s most bewildering to Her Majesty is this arrogant independence of the American courts.
After all, if you cannot rule the courts, you cannot rule.
Senor Calderon, as any true American will tell you, its the independence of our courts that keeps us free.
(Forsyth) John... I' m glad you came.
Mr President?
Senator Calhoun is here.
John!
I was afraid you weren' t going to be able to join us.
- You may put that fear to rest, sir.
Please.
I' d like you to meet Senor Calderon, ambassador from Spain.
- Thought you said he wasn' t coming.
- He said he wasn' t.
You see, Senor Calderon, there' s a growing number of people in this part of the country that regard us in the South as not only geographically beneath them.
(Exhales) They ignore the fact that slavery is so interwoven into the fabric of this society, that to destroy it would be to destroy us as a people.
It' s immoral.
That' s all they know.
Therefore, so are we.
Immoral and inferior.
We are inferior in one area.
We' re not as proficient in the art of gain.
We' re not as wealthy as our northern neighbors.
We' re still struggling.
Take away our life' s blood now...
Well, we all know what happens then.
North and South.
They become the masters, and we the slaves.
But not without a fight.
Senator Calhoun is being modest.
He' s not inferior in another area - the art of exaggeration.
Ask yourself, Senor Calderon...
What court wants to be responsible for the spark that ignites the firestorm?
What president wants to be in office... when it comes crashing down around him?
Certainly no court before this one.
Certainly no president before this one.
So...
Judge us not too harshly, sir, and bid Her Majesty like.
Because the real determination our courts and our president must make is not whether this ragtag group of Africans raised swords against their enemy, but rather... must we?
(Baldwin) Come along, Mr Joadson.
This news...
Well, of course, it' s bad news, but...
They may be more valuable to our struggle in death than in life.
Martyrdom, Mr Joadson. >From the dawn of Christianity, we have seen no stronger power for change.
You know it' s true.
What is true, Mr Tappan - and believe me when I tell you, I' ve seen this - is that there are men whose hatred of slavery is stronger than anything, except for the slave himself.
If you wish to inspire such hatred in a man, Mr Joadson, speak to him in that fashion and it may come true.
Our president, our big, big man, has appealed the decision to our Supreme Court.
What does that mean?
We have to try the case again.
Now, I- I know it' s hard to understand, Cinque.
I don' t understand, for that matter.
(Replies in Mende) (Covey) You said there would be a judgment, and we would go free.
No, no.
What I said is that we won it at the state level.
I said if we won it at the state level, we then go on.
- (Cinque shouts) - (Covey) That' s what you said!
- That' s what you said!
Yes, I said it!
I said it, but I shouldn' t have.
What I should have said...
- I can' t translate that.
- You can' t translate what?
- I can' t translate "should".
- There' s no Mende word for "should"?
No.
Either you do something, or you don' t do it.
What I meant to say, what I MEANT...
- (Groans)
- (Cinque shouts) - Try and understand me.
"Meant" is the same as "should".
You' re misunderstanding the language.
Cinque!
Listen to me.
Understand what I' m saying.
What I said to you before the judgment is almost how it works here.
- (Covey translates)
(Covey) Almost?
Yes, Cinque.
But not always.
Yes.
And that' s what' s happened here.
(Mende) What kind of place is this?
Where you almost mean what you say?
Where laws almost work?
How can you live like that?
(Baldwin) "To His Excellency, John Quincy Adams,
"Massachusetts member, House of Representatives.
"I have understood from Mr Joadson
"that you are acquainted with the plight of the Amistad Africans.
"If that is true, then you are aware that we have been,
"at every step, successful in our presentation of their case.
"Despite this,
"and despite the unlikelihood of President Van Buren' s re- election,
"he has appealed our most recent favourable decision
"to the highest court in the land.
"As I' m sure you are well aware,
"seven of nine of these Supreme Court justices
"are themselves Southern slave owners.
"Sir, we need you.
"If ever there was a time for a man to cast aside his daily trappings
"and array himself for battle, that time has come."
Thank you.
"that 'the result of this war
"depends on the life of one most brave and excellent man. '
"In our time, in this instance, I believe it depends on two.
"A courageous man, at present in irons, named Cinque,
"and you, sir.
"Sincerely, Roger S Baldwin, attorney- at- law."
Mr Tippings, excuse me a moment, please.
- Any word from...?
- What did Cinque say?
He won' t talk to you.
He won' t talk to me?
No.
(Baldwin) How' s your English coming?
No better than my Mende, I suppose.
Cinque, I know this isn' t something you necessarily want to think about, but has it occurred to you that I' m all you' ve got?
Because, since my practice has now completely deteriorated, you' re all I' ve got.
See, this is me.
You see?
You see?
You see how this works?
And- And- And this, this here, Cinque, is for me.
Hmm?
More death threats.
Some have been signed.
By my own clients, no less.
I should say, should say... former clients, shouldn' t I?
There is one more consequence to having no clientele to speak of.
I am now free to sit here as long as it takes for you to acknowledge me.
Yes, you understood that word, didn' t you?
Free.
All right.
Then we' il just sit.
Caesar.
Cicero' s appeal was to Julius Caesar, not Claudius.
Claudius would not be born for another hundred years.
You were right, there was one of them.
- Is that him?
- (Guard) Yes, Mr President.
Please unlock this door.
Adams has flirted with abolitionists for 15 years, but has yet to take one home.
- How old is he?
- Too old to take anyone home!
He sleeps through three quarters of the sessions on the Hill.
Let' s see.
President, slumbering congressman, jailhouse lawyer - one waits with great anticipation for what' s next!
- What must that be like?
Knowing all your life, whatever your accomplishments, you' il only be remembered as the son of a great father.
The only thing John Quincy Adams will remembered for is his middle name!
I wonder, is there anything as pathetic as an ex- president?
I was talking about John...
- Sir.
- Yes?
Cinque has asked me t- t- to ask you... whether you have thought about the question of jurisdiction.
What?
That since they took over the ship far out to sea, and since neither Spain nor America owns the sea, how is it that the treaty applies?
Tell him the treaty recognises no jurisdictional limitations.
- He will ask me why.
Because I said so.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?
Or their citizens.
"Or their citizens" is included in the language, if he must know.
Thank you, sir.
It' s a good point, though.
Does Britain have any treaties with West Africa which may override
- those between Spain and America?
- No.
Does Britain have any treaties with America
- which might override those...
Does America have treaties with West Africa?
No!
- Does Spain?
- No!
Does the Commonwealth of Connecticut
- have any treaties with West Africa?
- No, no, no, no!
Unshackle him.
I' m sorry, sir.
- I' m under strict orders...
- Unshackle him, please.
Yes, Mr President.
I brought over from China.
And this is a primrose from an English garden.
(Chuckles) And, uh, this spear lily, from the south of France.
This is my rose Blush Noisette.
This came all the way from, uh, Washington, DC, but don' t tell anyone.
Go on, go on.
African violet.
I can' t tell you how difficult that was to come by.
Now, you understand you' re going to the Supreme Court.
Do you know why?
It is the place where they finally kill us.
Well, yes, that may be true too.
(Laughs) That' s not what I meant.
No, there is another reason and a more important reason.
Although I' il admit that, uh, perhaps more so to us than you.
All right, don' t... (Coughs) Cinque...
Do you know who I am?
Has anyone told you about me?
- (Translates)
That you are a chief.
I was a chief, yes.
A chief cannot become anything less than a chief, even in death.
Oh, how I wish such were true here, Cinque.
You' ve no idea.
One tries to govern wisely, strongly, but...
One tries to govern in a way that betters the lives of one' s villagers.
One tries to... kill the lion.
Unfortunately, one isn' t always wise enough or strong enough.
Time passes... and the moment is gone.
Now, listen, Cinque.
Listen.
We' re about... We' re about to bring your case before the highest court in our land.
Were about to do battle with a lion that is threatening to rip our country in two.
And all we have on our side is a rock.
Of course, you didn' t ask to be at the centre of this historic conflagration any more than I did, but we find ourselves here, nonetheless, by some mysterious mix of circumstances and the whole world watching.
So, uh, what are we to do?
Huh?
(Mende) Is he going to help?
He has far many more questions than answers.
- What did he just say?
- I- I... Sorry, I didn' t catch it.
Cinque, look.
I' m being honest with you.
Anything less would be disrespectful.
I suppose I' m explaining to you, that the test ahead of us is an exceptionally difficult one.
- (Speaks Mende) - We won' t be going in there alone.
Alone?
Indeed not.
We have right at our side.
We have righteousness at our side.
We have Mr Baldwin over there.
(Covey, translating) I meant my ancestors.
I will call into the past, far back to the beginning of time, and beg them to come and help me at the judgment.
I will reach back and draw them into me.
And they must come, for at this moment, I am the whole reason they have existed at all.
Your Honours...
(Clears throat) I derive much consolation from the fact that my colleague, Mr Baldwin here, has argued the case in so able, and so complete a manner as to leave me scarcely anything to say.
However...
Why are we here?
How is it that a simple, plain property issue should now find itself so ennobled as to be argued before the Supreme Court of the United States of America?
Do we fear the lower courts, which found for us, missed the truth?
Or is it, rather, our great and consuming fear of civil war, that has allowed us to heap symbolism upon a simple case that never asked for it?
And now would have us disregard truth even as it stands before us, tall and proud as a mountain.
The truth... in truth, has been driven from this case like a slave.
Flogged from court to court, wretched and destitute.
And not by any great legal acumen on the part of the opposition, I might add.
But through the long, powerful arm of the executive office.
This is no mere property case, gentlemen.
This is the most important case ever to come before this court.
Because what it in fact concerns is the very nature of man.
Uh, these are, um...
These are transcriptions of letters written between our secretary of state, John Forsyth, and the Queen of Spain, Isabella the Second.
Now, I ask that you accept their perusal as part of your deliberations.
Thank you, sir.
I would not touch on them now except to notice a curious phrase which is much repeated.
The Queen again and again refers to our incompetent courts.
Now what, I wonder, would be more to her liking?
A court that finds against the Africans?
Well, I think not.
And here is the fine point of it.
What Her Majesty wants is a court that behaves just like her courts.
The courts this 11- year- old child plays with in her magical kingdom called Spain.
A court that can be toyed with like a doll.
(Chuckles) A court, as it happens, of which our own president,
Martin Van Buren, would be most proud.
Thank you.
This is a publication of the office of the President.
It' s called "The Executive Review", and I' m sure you all read it.
At least I' m sure the President hopes you all read it.
My former vice- president, John Calhoun, perhaps.
Could it be?
Who asserts that "there has never existed a civilized society
"in which one segment did not thrive upon the labour of another.
"As far back as one chooses to look,
"to ancient times, to Biblical times,
"history bears this out.
"In Eden, where only two were created.
"Even there, one was pronounced subordinate to the other.
"Slavery has always been with us,
"and is neither sinful nor immoral.
"Rather, as war and antagonism are the natural states of man,
"so, too, slavery, as natural as it is inevitable."
Well, gentlemen, I differ with the keen minds of the South, and with our president, who apparently shares their views, offering that the natural state of mankind is instead - and I know this is a controversial idea - is freedom.
Is freedom.
The proof is the length to which a man, woman or child will go to regain it, once taken.
He will break loose his chains.
He will... decimate his enemies.
He will try and try and try, against all odds, against all prejudices, to get home.
Cinque, would you stand up, if you would, so everyone can see you.
This man is black.
We can all see that.
That he is the only true hero in this room.
If he were white, he wouldn' t be in this court, fighting for his life.
If he were white and his enslavers British, he' d be weighed down by the medals and honours we would bestow upon him.
Songs would be written about him.
The great authors of our times would fill books about him.
His story would be told and retold, in our classrooms.
Our children, because we would make sure of it, would know his name as well as they know Patrick Henry' s.
Yet, if the South is right, what are we to do with that embarrassing, annoying document,
"The Declaration of Independence"?
What of its conceits?
"All men created equal," "inalienable rights," "life, liberty," and so on.
What on Earth are we to do with this?
I have a modest suggestion.
The other night I was talking with my friend Cinque.
He was over at my place, and we were out in the greenhouse together.
How when a member of the Mende encounters a situation where there appears no hope at all, he invokes his ancestors.
Tradition.
The Mende believe that if one can summon the spirit of one' s ancestors, then they have never left.
And the wisdom and strength they fathered and inspired will come to his aid.
James Madison, Alexander Hamilton,
Benjamin Franklin,
Thomas Jefferson,
George Washington,
John Adams.
We have long resisted asking your for guidance.
Perhaps we have feared in doing so, we might acknowledge that our individuality, which we so, so revere, is not entirely our own.
Perhaps were feared an... an appeal to you might be taken for weakness.
But we have come to understand, finally, that this is not so.
We understand now...
We' ve been made to understand, and to embrace the understanding that who we are is who we were.
We desperately need your strength and wisdom to triumph over our fears, our prejudices, ourselves.
Give us the courage to do what is right.
And if it means civil war, then let it come.
And when it does, may it be, finally, the last battle of the American Revolution.
That' s all I have to say.
In the case of the United States of America versus the Amistad Africans, it is the opinion of this court that our treaty of 1795 with Spain, on which the prosecution has primarily based its arguments, is inapplicable.
While it is clearly stipulated in Article 9 that - and I quote -
"Seized ships and cargo
It has not been shown to the court' s satisfaction that these particular Africans fit that description.
We are then left with the alternative that they are not slaves, and therefore cannot be considered merchandise, but are, rather, free individuals with certain legal and moral rights, including the right to engage in insurrection against those who would deny them their freedom.
And therefore, over one dissent, it is the court' s judgment that the defendants are to be released from custody at once, and, if they so choose, to be returned to their homes in Africa.
Thank you.
Well...
- (Covey) What did you say to them?
(Covey) What words did you use to persuade them?
- Yours.
To keep you safe.
Thank you... Baldwin.
(Officer) Fire!
All clear, sir.
- Fire.
- Fire!
- Fire.

For you, Brad, I got five!
So, yeah, I' m sure you can understand our need to cut corners around here.
Oh, sure.
Times are tight.
You got to free up some cash.
You got to spend money to make money.
- Right?
- Exactly.
Like the time that Mr. Flournoy used the company MasterCard to pay for that hooker, and she used the card numbers and stayed at the St. Regis for, what was it, three months?
- That' s unsubstantiated gossip.
- That' s $50, 000.
That' s somebody' s salary.
That' s somebody who' s going to get fired because Craig has to pay women to fuck him!
Jesus!
I mean, calm down.
Nobody' s getting fired yet.
- That' s why we' re having everyone... write out a job description mapping out in detaiI how they contribute.
That way management can assess who' s valuable --
And who' s expendable.
It' s just business.
I' ve been writing for this magazine for 14 years.
- You' ve been here how Iong?
- I' m one of the good guys, Les.

They' ve hired this efficiency expert, this reaIly friendly guy named Brad --
How perfect is that?
And he' s basicaIly there to make it seem they' re justified... in firing somebody, because they couldn' t just come out and say that, could they?
No, no.
That would just be too honest.
So they' ve asked us -- [Chuckling]
You couldn' t possibly care Iess, could you?
What do you expect?
You can' t aII of a sudden be my best friend just because you had a bad day.

I don' t want to be rude.
Nice suit.
You' re Iooking good, Mr. Burnham.
Last time I saw you, you Iooked kind of wound up.
Ooh, is that root beer?
I love root beer, don' t you?
- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.
- Remember Angela?
Yes, of course.
She' s going to spend the night.
Is that okay?
Sorry about my dad.
- [Angela]
I think it' s funny.
Yeah, to you he' s just another guy who wants to jump your bones.
But to me, he' s just... too embarrassing to Iive.
WeIl, your mom' s the one who' s embarrassing.
What a phony.
- But your dad' s actuaIly kind of cute.
- Shut up.
[Angela]
If he just worked out a Iittle, he' d be hot.
- Shut up!
- Come on.
Like you' ve never sneaked a peek at him in his underwear?
I bet he' s got a big dick.
[Jane Laughing]
You are so grossing me out right now.
If he built up his chest and arms, I would totaIly fuck him. - @ La, Ia, Ia, Ia, Ia, Ia @ - I would.
I would suck your dad' s big fat dick, and then I' d fuck him untiI his eyes roIled back in his head.
- [Rattling]
What was that noise?
- I swear I heard something.
- Yeah.
That was the sound of you being a huge, disgusting pig.
- [Rattling]
See?
- Oh, my God.
Jane.
- What is it?
It' s that psycho next door.
Jane, what if he worships you?
What if he' s got a shrine with pictures of you surrounded by dead people' s heads and stuff?
Shit.
I bet he' s filming us right now.
ReaIly?
Welcome to America' s Weirdest Home Videos.
Ricky?
Coming, Dad.
You know I don' t Iike Iocked doors in my house, boy.
- Mm.
So what' s up?
I -- I need a urine sample.
Wow.
It' s been six months already.
Can I give it to you in the morning?
I just took a whiz.
Yeah.
I suppose.
Y- You know --
WeIl, good night, son.
I' ve been waiting for you.
You' ve been working out, haven' t you?
I can teIl.
I was hoping you could give me a bath.
I' m very, very dirty.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
- You were masturbating.
I was not.
Yes, you were.
Oh, aII right.
So shoot me.
I was whacking off.
That' s right.
I was choking the bishop, chafing the carrot.
You know, saying "hi" to my monster.
That' s disgusting.
WeIl, excuse me, but some of us stiII have blood pumping through our veins.
- So do I.
- ReaIly?
WeIl, I' m the only one who seems to be doing anything about it.
Lester, I refuse to Iive Iike this!
This is not a marriage.
This hasn' t been a marriage for years, but you were happy as Iong as I kept my mouth shut.
WeIl, guess what.
I' ve changed.
'cause you' re obviously not going to help me out in that department.
I see.
You think you' re the only one who' s sexuaIly frustrated.
I' m not?
WeIl, then, come on, baby.
I' m ready.
I wiII divorce you so fast, it' II make your head spin.
On what grounds?
I' m not a drunk.
I don' t fuck other women.
I don' t mistreat you.
I' ve never hit you.
I don' t even try to touch you, since you made it so abundantly clear... just how unnecessary you consider me to be!
I did support you when you got your Iicense.
And some people might think that entitles me to half of what' s yours.
So, turn out the Iight when you come back to bed, okay?
It' s a great thing when you realize you stiII have... the ability to surprise yourself.
Makes you wonder what else you can do that you' ve forgotten about.
Hey, guys.
Lester.
I didn' t know you ran.
- I just started.
- Good for you.
I figured you guys might be able to give me some pointers.
I need to shape up, fast.
Are you Iooking to just Iose weight, or do you want to have... increased strength and flexibility as weII?
I -- I want to Iook good naked.
Oh, what is this?
Fuckin 'gay pride parade?
Yo, Ricky.
My entire Iife is passing before my eyes, and those two have barely broken a sweat.
Sorry.
Hi.
Lester Burnham.
I Iive next door.
We haven' t met.
ColoneI Frank Fitts, U. S. Marine Corps.
WeIl.
Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.
Ricky, uh --
I was thinking about the, uh -- I was gonna -- The movie we talked about.
- Re- Animator.
- Yeah!
You want to borrow it?
Okay.
It' s up in my room.
Come on.
- Can you hold this for a sec?
- Sure.
I don' t think my dad would try to come in while someone else is here, but you never know.
- What is this?
- Urine.
I have to take a drug test every six months just to make sure I' m clean.
Are you kidding?
You just smoked with me Iast night.
It' s not mine.
One of my clients is a nurse in a pediatrician' s office.
Cut her a deal, she keeps me in clean piss.
You Iike Pink Floyd?
I Iike a Iot of music.
Man, I haven' t Iistened to this album in years.
How much do you want?
I don' t know.
It' s been a while.
Um, how much is an ounce?
This is totaIly decent, and it' s 300.
Wow!
This shit is top of the Iine.
It' s geneticaIly engineered by the U. S. government.
It' s extremely potent, but a completely meIlow high.
No paranoia.
Is that what we smoked Iast night?
This is aII I ever smoke.
- How much?
- Two grand.
Jesus!
Things have changed since 1973.
I know you' re good for it.
- Thanks.
There' s a card in there with my beeper number.
Beep me anytime, day or night.
And I only accept cash.
Now I know how you can afford aII this equipment.
When I was your age, I flipped burgers aII summer just to buy an eight- track.
- That sucks.
- No, actuaIly it was great.
AII I did was party and get Iaid.
I had my whole Iife ahead of me.
My dad thinks I pay for aII this with catering jobs.
Never underestimate the power of denial.
- @ I can' t get no relief @ - What the heII do you think you' re doing?

Mom' s mad. - @@ [Continues]
Bench presses.
I' m going to whale on my pecks, and then I' m going to do my back.
I see you' re smoking pot now.
I -- I' m so glad.
I think using iIlegaI psychotropic substances... is a very positive example to set for our daughter.
You' re one to talk, you bloodless, money- grubbing freak.
Uh -- Lester!
You have such hostility in you.
Do you mind?
I' m trying to work out here.
Unless... you want to spot me.
Lester, you wiII not get away with this.

"and at Ieast once a day retiring to the men' s room...
WeIl, you obviously have no interest in saving yourself.
Brad, for 14 years, I' ve been a whore for the advertising industry.
The only way I could save myself now is if I start firebombing.
Whatever.
Management wants you gone by the end of the day.
Just what sort of severance package is management prepared to offer me, considering the information I have about our editoriaI director... buying pussy with company money?
Which I think would interest the I. R. S., since it technicaIly constitutes fraud.
Craig' s wife.
- What do you want?
- One year' s salary with benefits.
That' s not going to happen.
What do you say I throw in a Iittle sexuaI harassment charge to boot?
Against who?
Against you.
Can you prove that you didn' t offer to save my job... if I Iet you blow me?
Man... you are one twisted fuck.
Nope.
I' m just an ordinary guy... with nothing to Iose.
Yeah.
- Carolyn.
- Buddy.
- I am so sorry to have kept you waiting.
[Chuckles]
Christy Ieft for New York this morning.
Let' s just say things were a Iittle... hectic around the house.
- What' s she doing in New York?
- She' s moving there.
Yes, we are splitting up.
Buddy.
I' m so sorry.
Yes.
According to her, I' m... too focused on my career.
[Chuckling]
WeIl, she certainly did take advantage of the Iifestyle my success afforded her.
Wow.
- Ah, it' s for the best.
- Mm- hmm.
When I saw you two at the party the other night, you seemed perfectly happy.
WeIl, caII me crazy, but it is my philosophy that in order to be successful, one must project an image of success... at aII times.
What are you doing?
- I was filming this dead bird.
- Why?
Because it' s beautiful.
I think maybe you forgot your medication today, mentaI boy.
Hi, Jane.
I want you to stop filming me.
Okay.
This is boring.
Let' s go.
- Do you need a ride?
- Are you crazy?
I don' t want to end up hacked to pieces in a Dumpster somewhere.
It' s okay.
I' II walk.
But thanks.
He doesn' t want to go anyway.
Let' s go.
- Come on, Jane.
- I think I' m going to walk too.
What?
Jane, that' s, Iike, almost a mile.
Oh, God!
Oh!

ActuaIly, I' d Iike to fiII out an application.
It' s just for counter.
- Good.
I' m Iooking for the Ieast possible amount of responsibility.
I don' t think you' d fit in here.
I have fast food experience.
Yeah, Iike 20 years ago.
I' m sure there' ve been amazing technologicaI advances in the industry, but surely you must have some sort of training program.
It seems unfair to presume I won' t be able to Iearn.
- That was exactly what I needed -- - Mm.
the "royaI treatment," so to speak.
Ah!
Know what I do when I feeI Iike that?
What?
- I fire a gun.
- ReaIly?
I go to this Iittle firing range downtown, and I... just pop off a few rounds.
- I' ve never fired a gun before.
- WeIl, you' ve gotta try it.
Nothing makes you feeI more powerful.
WeIl... almost nothing.
- So, do you Iike your new house?
- I Iike it.
The people who used to Iive there fed these stray cats, so they were always around, and it drove my mother nuts.
And then she cut down their tree.
Is that a funeraI?
Yeah.
Have you ever known anybody who died?
No.
Have you?
No.
But I did see this homeless woman who froze to death once... just Iaying there on the sidewalk.
She Iooked reaIly sad.
I got that homeless woman on videotape.
Why would you film that?
- Because it was amazing.
- What' s amazing about it?
When you see something Iike that, it' s Iike God is Iooking right at you, just for a second, and if you' re careful, you can Iook right back.
And what do you see?
Beauty.
Mom, I want you to meet somebody.
- Mom.
- Yes?
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Jane.
- Hi.
- Oh, my.
I apologize for the way things Iook around here.
This is where my dad hides out.
I take it he' s got a thing for guns.
You gotta see this one thing.
My dad would kiII me if he knew I was in here.
Did you steaI his keys?
No.
One of my clients is a Iocksmith.
He was short on cash one night, so I Iet him pay me in trade.
Turn it over.
Oh, my God.
It' s, Iike, officiaI state china of the Third Reich.
There' s a whole subculture of people who coIlect this Nazi shit.
But my dad just has this one thing.
- What' s wrong?
- Nothing.
No, you' re scared of me.
No, I' m not.
You want to see the most beautifuI thing I' ve ever filmed?
It was one of those days... where it' s a minute away from snowing, and there was this electricity in the air.
You can almost hear it.
Iike a Iittle kid begging me to play with it, for 15 minutes.
That' s the day I realized that there was this... entire Iife behind things...
and this incredibly benevolent force... that wanted me to know that there was no reason to be afraid... ever.
Video' s a poor excuse, I know, but it helps me remember.
I need to remember.
I feeI Iike I can' t take it...
and my heart... is just going to... cave in.
Oh, my God.
What time is it? @@ [Lounge]
- Sorry I' m Iate.
- No, that' s quite aII right, dear.
Your father and I were just discussing his day at work.
Why don' t you teII our daughter about it, honey?
- [Laughing]
Then I told my boss to go fuck himself, and then I blackmailed him for almost $60, 000.
- Pass the asparagus.
- Your father seems to think... this kind of behavior is something to be proud of.
And your mother seems to prefer that I go through Iife Iike a fucking prisoner... while she keeps my dick in a Mason jar under the sink.
How dare you speak to me that way in front of her?
And I marveI that you can be so contemptuous of me... on the same day that you Iose your job!
I didn' t Iose it.
It' s not Iike, "Whoops, where did my job go?"
I quit!
Pass the asparagus.
And I want to thank you for putting me under the added pressure... of being the sole breadwinner now.
- No, no!
Don' t give a second thought as to who' s going to pay the mortgage.
We' II Ieave it up to Carolyn.
"You' re going to take care of everything now, Carolyn?"
"Yes.

If you don' t complain, what is this?
Yeah, Iet' s bring in the Iaugh meter and see how Ioud it gets on that one.
Don' t interrupt me, honey.
And another thing.
I am reaIly tired of this Lawrence Welk shit.

Look, Mom, I reaIly don' t feeI Iike having a Kodak moment here.

Just Iook at everything you have!
When I was your age, I Iived in a duplex!
We didn' t even have our own house.

Dad, no, I just --
How did you get in there?
How?
How?
Come on!
Come on!
Get up!
Fight back, you Iittle pussy!
- No, sir, I won' t fight you.
- How?
- How did you get in there?
- I picked the Iock, sir.
What were you Iooking for, huh?
Are you on dope again?
No, sir.
I wanted to show my girlfriend your Nazi plate.
A girlfriend?
Yes, sir.

[Coughing]
This is for your own good, boy.
You have no respect for other people' s things and for authority --
Yes, sir.
I' m sorry.
Can' t just go around doing whatever you feeI Iike.
You can' t.
There are rules in Iife.
Yes, sir.
You need structure, yeah.
You need --

- Yes, sir.
Thank you for trying to teach me.
Don' t give up on me, Dad.
Oh, Ricky.
You stay out of there.
- I gotta say, Mrs. Burnham, when you first came here, I thought you would be hopeless, but you' re a natural.
WeIl, aII I know is I love shooting this gun.
What?
Uh, whose car is that out front?
Mine.
1970 Pontiac Firebird, the car I' ve always wanted, and now I have it.
- Uh- huh.
Where' s the Camry?
I traded it in.
- Shouldn' t you have consulted me first?
- Hm, Iet me think.
No.
You never drove it.
Have you done something different?
You Iook great.
Where' s Jane?
Jane not home.
We have... the whole house... to ourselves.
Christ, Carolyn.
When did you become so... joyless?
Joyless?
I am not joyless.
There happens to be a Iot about me... that you don' t know, Mr. Smarty Man.
There' s plenty of joy in my Iife.
Whatever happened to that girl...
who used to fake seizures at frat parties when she got bored?
Who used to run up to the roof of our first apartment building... to flash the traffic helicopters?
- Have you totaIly forgotten about her?
Because I haven' t.
Lester, you' re going to spiII beer on the couch.
So what?
It' s just a couch.
This is a $4, 000 sofa, upholstered in Italian silk.
This is not just a couch.
It' s just... a... couch!
This isn' t Iife!
This is just stuff, and it' s become more important to you than Iiving.
WeIl, honey, that' s just nuts.
I' m only trying to help you!
Don' t.
Why?
It' s weird watching myself.
I don' t Iike how I Iook.
I can' t believe you don' t know how beautifuI you are.
Look.
I' m not going to sit here for that shit.
Ha!
How does it feeI now?
Fine.
You don' t feeI naked?
I am naked.
You know what I mean.
So teII me about being in the hospital.
When I was 15, my dad caught me smoking dope.
He totaIly freaked and decided to send me to military school.
I told you this whole thing about structure and discipline, right?
Of course, I got kicked out.
Dad and I had this huge fight.
He hit me.
And the next day at school, some kid made a crack about my haircut, and I just snapped.
I wanted to kiII him.
I would' ve... kiIled him... if they hadn' t puIled me off.
That' s when my dad put me in the hospital.
They drugged me up and Ieft me in there for two years.
- [Lighter Clicking]
No.
He' s not a bad man.
WeIl, you' d better believe I' d hate my dad if he did something Iike that to me.
Wait.
I already do hate my dad.
Why?
He' s a totaI asshole; he' s got this crush on my friend Angela, and it' s disgusting.
- You' d rather he had the crush on you.
No.
- [Chuckling]
But it' d be nice if I was anywhere near as important to him as she is.
I know you think my dad' s harmless, but you' re wrong.
He' s doing massive psychologicaI damage to me.
How?
WeIl, now I, too, need structure, a Iittle fucking discipline.
I' m serious, though.
How could he not be damaging me?
I need a father who' s a role model, not some horny geek boy who' s going to spray his shorts... whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school.
Someone reaIly should just... put him out of his misery.
Want me to kiII him for you?
Yeah.
Would you?
It' II cost you.
I' ve been baby- sitting since I was about ten.
I' ve got almost $3, 000.
Of course I was saving it up for a boob job.
But --
You know, that' s not a very nice thing to do -- hiring someone to kiII your dad.

Nope.

I don' t get scared.

This is my first time.
You' re kidding.
I' m sorry.
I stiII want to do it.
I just... thought I should teII you... in case you wondered why I --

What' s wrong?
I thought you said I was beautiful.
You are beautiful.

Don' t.

You have nothing to be sorry about.
It' s okay.
Everything' s okay.
Wow, I was starving.

I' m fine.
You sure?
I' m stiII a Iittle weirded out, but I feeI better.
Thanks.
- How' s Jane?
- What do you mean?
I mean, how' s her Iife?
Is she happy?
Is she miserable?
I' d reaIly Iike to know, and she' d die before she' d ever teII me about it.
She' s, uh --
She' s reaIly happy.
[Scoffs]
Good for her.
How are you?
It' s been a Iong time since anybody asked me that.
I' m great.
I' ve gotta go to the bathroom.
I' m great.
Man, oh man.
Man, oh man, oh man.
Oh, my God.
[Lester Narrating]
I had always heard your entire Iife flashes... in front of your eyes the second before you die.
First of aIl, that one second... isn' t a second at aIl.
Iike an ocean of time.
For me, it was Iying on my back... at Boy Scout camp, watching faIling stars.
And yeIlow Ieaves from the maple trees... that Iined our street.
Or my grandmother' s hands and the way her skin... seemed Iike paper.
And the first time I saw my cousin Tony' s... brand- new Firebird.
And Janie.
And Janie.
Carolyn.
I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me, but it' s hard to stay mad when there' s so much beauty in the world.
Sometimes I feeI Iike I' m seeing it aII at once and it' s too much.
My heart fiIls up Iike a baIloon that' s about to burst.
And then I remember to relax... and stop trying to hold on to it.
And then it flows through me Iike rain, and I can' t feeI anything but gratitude... for every single moment... of my stupid Iittle Iife.
You have no idea what I' m talking about, I' m sure.

Sebastian, Sebastian, stop pouting.
Sorry.
You are not a dope.
You' re just misguided.
All the reports from your teachers say the same thing:
"Sebastian would make an exceptional student if only he would follow orders."
I can' t believe you fed the school hamster an overdose of Viagra.
I was testing the reproductive system for a science experiment...
- and I wanted to see how big -- - Enough!
Fortunately for you, you are moving to a new town.
You will have a chance to start anew.
It' s time to shape up.
Speaking of shaping up, how' s Mrs. Freeman doing?
I see she' s lost some weight.
- She looks good.
- Thank you.
I gotta tell ya, it' s a really great thing... she' s doing for the community, censoring books and all.
That Catcher in the Rye novel really screwed me up.
Mrs. Freeman knows what' s best for young minds.
Which comes to my point.
I was wondering what you planned on doing with my file?
- It' s not very favorable and -- - And... you' d prefer if I didn' t forward it to your new school.
I' ve thought long and hard about it... and I' ve decided to send it.
I mean, if you' ve really changed, you' il rise above your past mistakes.
How can I ever thank you, sir?
Well, you have got a plane to catch, and I have got some work to do.
So, you just remember, Sebastian:
The future is what you make of it.
The future is what I make of it.
The future is what I make of it.
Got it.
I' il never forget you, sir.
Yeah, yeah, right, right.
Pansy.
Ed Freeman.
What the fuck have you done tome, you fucking asshole?
What' s wrong, pumpkin?
Have you seen my picture in the school yearbook?
Uh, yes, you look wonderful.
Wonderful?
Fuck.
I' m the laughingstock of the community.
How could you have let this happen?
You weaselly little piece of shit!
You' il pay for this!
Ed, I hate you!
Asshole!
Don' t think you are gonna get away with this stunt.
- So where you heading?
- New York City.
- For you.
- Thanks.
Bye- bye.
- Yeah.
I' il take care of the driver, sir.
Your family' s expecting you.
Which apartment?
The whole building, sir.
Of course.
What was I thinking?
Oh, my God!
Sebastian Valmont to see you, sir.
- Ah, good to see you again, son.
How' s your mother?
Oh, Dr. Rappaport thinks she' s gonna be in rehab for the long haul.
Thanks for taking me in.
You know, foster homes just aren' t my thing.
Think nothing of it.
Man, you really hit the mother lode this time, Pops.
Sebastian, I would like you to meet the love of my life.
This is Tiffany.
Well, it' s a pleasure to finally meet you.
I see you have your father' s beautiful blue eyes.
Thank you.
My, what a precious little kitty you have.
Would you like to pet her?
Some other time.
Sebastian, come meet Kathryn.
I' ve heard so much about you.
Welcome to the family.
I' ve always wanted a brother, but they were sold out of them at Bloomingdale' s.
- Is that a real Steinway?
- I wouldn' t play anything else.
- Be my guest.
Kathryn is an exquisite pianist, Sebastian.
Really?
Cute.
I think it needs a tuning.
Mother, Sebastian must be famished.
Shouldn' t we check on dinner?
I think that' s a wonderful idea.
I' m so excited you' il be starting Manchester with me tomorrow.
- with wonderful teachers.
- Wonderful.
Kathryn is president of the student body.
Let' s not forget president of the French Club.
I live for extracurricular activities.
Student body president?
I am.
I believe one should not be hampered in achieving one' s goals... simply by the paltriness of one' s years.
- You mean "dearth."
- Excuse me.
Well, paltriness implies insignificance... but really it' s your lack of age that shouldn' t hamper you... from achieving your goals.
Careful with those SAT words.
They can be deadly.
Thank you.
Isn' t Kathryn just the best, son?
- Yeah, she' s a real peach, Dad.
- I love you, Step daddy.
I' m a little tired from all the travel.
Do you mind if I turn in?
Not at all.
I know you have a big day ahead of you tomorrow.
I' il show you to your room.
- I was not -- What?
- You hear me?
Get down there!
Do not fuck with me.
So... he outdoes you at piano, he outdoes you at vocabulary.
I guess I overestimated you.
And don' t sulk.
It' s a sign of weakness.
Yes, Mother.
No, everything' s fine.
I was just checking up on you, Mom.
Look, I promised I' d take care of you, right?
Well, I' m gonna talk to Dad and get you into a better facility.
It' s the least he can do.
I love you too.
- What the -- - Let' s get something straight!
I may not have fooled you, but I' ve got a great thing going with the rentals.
I don' t have a curfew, they never bother me about my homework... and I' ve got a five- figure allowance.
No one -- and I mean no one -- is about to threaten my cushy lifestyle... especially not some two- bit hick loser.
- But -- - I don' t wanna hear it.
Now, as for school, you stay out of my face... and we' il get along just fine, but if you cross me once...
I' il bury your sorry ass, understood?
All right.
I' m glad we could have this little discussion.
Not bad.
- What' s the matter?
- This collar' s too tight.
Oh, I guess you' re only used to wearing mesh shirts where you come from.
More SAT vocabulary builders?
For your information, this happens to be my orientation speech.
Who are you orienting?
Please, be more stupid.
I am the student body president.
Ivy League schools eat this extracurricular crap up for supper.
You do know what an Ivy League school is?
Stop!
Gordon Anderson -- looking good.
Pretend you don' t know me.
My God, you' re beautiful.
- Excuse me?
Thank you.
Excuse me, but what did you mean by that remark?
- What remark?
- That I' m beautiful.
- Well, yeah.
I mean, no, no, but --
Never mind.
You' re very strange.
I know.
Yeah.
I heard he' s a total joke.
I wouldn' t know.
The headmaster will see you now.
I have never seen a file quite like this.
4. 0 GPA, president of several clubs... all- star snowboarding for your county... as well as several glowing letters from your teachers... including your former principal.
We were very close, he and I, sir.
- Yes, it' s most impressive.
- Thank you.
Perhaps a little too impressive.
Thank you.
That aside, I' m sure an enterprising young man like yourself... would be a welcome addition here at Manchester.
- Thank you, sir.
- Come in.
You had a few grammaticals, but nothing reprehensible.
Thank you, honey.
Sebastian, I' d like you to meet my daughter, Danielle.
You' re both in the same class.
Have we met?
No, I don' t think so.
Are you sure?
Must' ve been someone else.
Well, I' d better get going.
It was very nice meeting you, sir.
Ma' am.
- Good luck, Sebastian.
- Thank you, sir.
Don' t you think?
- We' il see.
Hail to thee O stars of pride
Manchester
Be seated.
We will now hear from your new student body president...
Kathryn Merteuil.
Fellow students, faculty, administrators and custodians...
I would personally like to welcome each and every one of you... to what I think will be Manchester' s proudest year.
- She is such an inspiration.
- I consider... each and every one of you... members of my Manchester Prep family.
With that said, I feel it is our responsibility to... reach out and accept all new students... as members of --
And accept all new students as --
- Settle down, people.
- Are you all right?
- Sorry.
It happens when I get nervous.
Guess I just need a bubble gum fix.
Keep going.
You' re doing great.
Thanks.
I consider each and every one of you members... of my Manchester Prep family.
With that said, I feel that it is our responsibility to reach out... and accept all new students --
Somebody do something!
Good going, Danielle.
Bravo!
Terrific.
Right.
Sparing me the Cliff Notes synopsis.... who can tell me what this means?
Mr. Winkler.
Jekyil was a doctor... and he developed this potion that transformed into...
My gosh, did that answer suck.
Now come on, I know you' ve got it in you.
What themes can be discussed here?
Miss Sherman.
I think Stevenson is talking about the duality of man.
Man has both good and evil in him.
If man cannot suppress his evil instincts, he is inevitably doomed.
- Wrong!
- Care to elaborate on that?
Nowhere in the novel does Stevenson mention good over evil.
In fact, it' s just the opposite.
Jekyil loved Hyde so much that he protected him from the world.
He protected Hyde so he wouldn' t hurt people.
He loved hurting people.
- Where does it say that in the book?
- The end!
Mr. Utterson found his body.
- Utterson was idiotic.
- Your point is idiotic.
Break it up, you two.
Wow!
Am I losing my mind... or did we just witness an intellectual debate in this classroom?
Although I disagree with your conclusions, Mr. Valmont...
I do appreciate your warped point of view.
As for you, Miss Sherman...
I think you could be a little more tolerant of other people' s opinions.
Hey, fellas, welcome back.
Hey, Rene, good to see you.
Assistant Headmaster Mueller!
Steve.
I thought I told you not to call me by my first name.
- Later.
I' m busy right now.
- Stop that.
- I said, we need to talk.
What is it?
Do you see something wrong?
I have gym.
You know I loathe gym.
We Merteuils do not like to perspire.
What is this "we Merteuils" nonsense?
You' re a student.
Try acting like one.
- Excuse me?
- Look, Kathryn, rules are rules.
- I' m sorry, but you' re going to gym.
- I understand.
- Yes.
But it' s a bit strange...
like you did to me this summer in the Hamptons?
Now you know that' s not entirely true.
It was you who seduced me.
You know, you' re right.
It was me who seduced you.
But then again, who will the school board believe?
It' s my word against yours.
Think about it, Steve.
Something like this could ruin your career... not to mention your marriage.
But I guess if you can bend the rules a little, then so can I.
- I' il see what I can do.
- You' re the best.
This meeting of the Manchester Tribunal will now come to order.
- Thank you, Blaine.
Fellow students of affluence and popularity...
I welcome you to this year' s first meeting of the Manchester Tribunal.
As your new leader, I promise to do my best... to weed out the geeks, losers and underprivileged... and toss their fat asses out of our school.
- Here' s the latest shipment, Mrs. Gagin.
- Thank you.
Could you re- shelf these for me?
Thanks.
- My God!
A cartoon cock?
- Hi.
- Are you all right?
- You scared me to death.
- You dropped this.
- I didn' t drop it.
Yes, you did, but it' s all right.
Sexual curiosity is nothing to be ashamed of.
I' m not ashamed, and I have a very healthy sexual curiosity.
Really?
- So what are you doing here?
- I work here.
Do you think you can take a 1 5- minute break and join me for a cup of coffee?
I' d love to, but unfortunately I have a lot of work to do around here.
Mrs. Gagin, do you mind if Danielle joins me for a coffee break?
Please, go right ahead.
There' s nothing to do right now.
- Thank you.
- You don' t quit, do you?
Whatever happened to "be nice to the new kid in school"?
- Fifteen minutes.
- Go.
Next.
Michael Keen, freshman.
Former BMOC of his junior high school.
Don' t let his bad acne dissuade you, though.
His father owns the Coliseum.
Let' s get him a facial and see if he can score front- row tickets to Hole.
Next.
Sebastian Valmont, sophomore.
Son of Edward and Corrine.
- I can' t.
He' s a transfer student, and I don' t have any more information on him yet.
Don' t you know anything else about him?
He is your stepbrother.
I' ve only known him for a day.
He' s a total loser.
I mean, he shops at the Gap.
- Will do.
- Next.
Cherie Clayman, freshman.
Daughter of Hubert and Bunny.
Annual family income --
Well? $850 million.
- She' s richer than Kathryn.
- I heard that.
She has a GPA of 1. 3, and not only is she a virgin... but she never even kissed a boy before.
Okay, this girl is a walking Teletubby... just begging to be made an example of.
I think I' il oversee this one personally.
When I get through with her, she will be the premiere slut at Manchester Prep.
Next order of business: grievances.
Yes, Lauren?
Well, it appears we' re having a bit of trouble with the new school chef.
Mr. Washington seems to think that sushi... is an inappropriate meal for growing girls and boys.
All those in favor of sending Mr. Washington... back to his hot dog stand, say aye.
- Aye.
Okay, bye- bye, Mr. Washington.
Hello, Mr. Yakamoto.
So, what' s a nice girl like you doing at a snobbish school like Manchester?
It' s called free tuition.
Besides, it' s not as bad as it seems.
My dad took over the place a year after my mom passed away.
I' m sorry.
Your turn.
Folks split up ten years ago.
Mom has a drug problem.
And everyone thought it would be best if I moved in with my dad.
You get along with him?
I don' t really know him.
He' s on his fourth marriage.
- Yeah.
I know this is rude, but what' s it like growing up with all that money?
Well, you know, I' m only one day into it.
Sorry to disappoint you, my dear, but Richie Rich I' m not.
And I thought I was the only one at Manchester.
You ever get the feeling you' re being watched?
- Yours?
- Hers.
There you are, silly goose.
I' ve been looking all over for you.
Hi, Danielle.
How' s the used bookstore?
- Don' t let her get to you.
- She doesn' t.
Maybe it makes me uncool, but I don' t care what your stepsister thinks of me.
Actually, I think that makes you very cool.
I don' t want her to make me hitch a ride home.
- Yeah.
I' il call you later.
- Don' t underestimate me.
Don' t underestimate Kathryn.
- Let' s go.
- See you.
Bye.
It was great!
This uptight bitch got gum stuck in her hair.
Touch?.
Hi.
Cherie, it' s Kathryn, from school.
No, I don' t hate you.
As a matter of fact, I was just appointed your big sister.
Can you come out tonight?
It' s a school event.
Great!
I' il pick you up at 8: 00.
See you, sweetie.
You' re going out with the girl who spit gum in your hair?
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
She' s just a freshman.
Pick on someone your own size.
Like you?
In due time.
So, you have a thing for boring virgins.
Danielle is a virgin, you know?
Careful, Kathryn.
Ooh.
You actually have a backbone.
- Don' t push me, Kathryn.
- Any time you want to start a war --
I' il keep it under consideration.
36: 1 5.
Yeah!
Good evening, Master Sebastian.
And how was your evening jaunt?
Not bad at all.
Where are the folks?
Dinner with a sheik.
Cook has your meal ready.
Will you be showering before or after dinner, sir?
- I hadn' t really thought about it.
Anything I can do to make your evening more relaxing, just let me know.
Thanks, Henry.
This way, sir.
Please make yourself comfortable.
G? nter has prepared sweetbread mousse.
It' s like dinner at the Adams Family.
Guys.
Hello?
Anyone?
Is everything all right?
Henry, I think I' il get something later, go out or something.
If you need the car, just let Frederick know.
Sure.
No, it' s not like that at all.
- Well, of course, I miss you.
- You do?
We' il get together very soon.
I promise.
- What are you wearing?
- Just -- Edward!
- I didn' t.
- That was my accountant on the phone.
You guys must have a really tight relationship.
Now, look, son, don' t make me regret taking you in.
Well, I see that old habits die hard, or, in your case, don' t die at all.
I' m your father, and I demand to be treated with some respect.
- A man has needs -- - Look, Dad, spare me the melodrama.
But, a word of advice?
You got a pretty good thing going here.
I wouldn' t screw it up, if I were you.
You know, Sebastian, I really like these father- son chats.
You' re a real role model.
Would you sit the fuck down!
Thanks, Moose.
Shut up, losers.
One mineral water, one iced tea.
This sure doesn' t taste like an iced tea.
It' s from Long Island.
Here, have another.
- What' s the latest, Kathryn?
- Me, as usual.
Court, I' d like you to meet Cherie Clayman.
How' s it going, Cherie?
Excuse me.
I think we should adjourn to the ladies' room.
- But I don' t have to go.
- I do.
So what do you need my help for?
- No.
- Right.
- So how do you know he likes me?
- I can see it in his eyes.
If you say so.
So what do I do about it?
You' re gonna have to let him fuck you.
But I' ve never even been to first base with a guy.
Well, so we' il start with first base and then we' il move on.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Ready?
- Ready.
- That was easy.
- Okay, we' re gonna try this again.
This time I want you to close your eyes.
Court' s gonna stick his tongue in your mouth.
Okay?
Ready.
You idiot!
These are $300 pants.
I' m sorry.
Oh, God!
Stupid bitch.
He hates me.
Shh.
- I told you not to underestimate me.
- You' re unbelievable.
- Thank you.
Oh, come on.
The TV series MASH was way better than the movie.
- If you say so.
- I do.
What time is it?
- It' s 1 0: 30.
Whoo.
Call the police.
Homework.
Hey, listen, what are you up to on Saturday?
I' m looking for a tour guide to show me the sights.
Oh, I can' t, I have plans.
Come on, you gotta rescue me from my psycho stepsister.
At least a few hours.
Look, don' t you think we should take this slower?
You know, I don' t really know you and --
Take what slow?
I wasn' t asking you on a date.
- I just wanted to make a new friend.
- I know, I wasn' t --
- Man, are you conceited.
It' s just --
- I have to go.
Hello?
Always make an impression.
- Psycho stepsister?
- Evening.
Evening.
Oh, she shot you down.
Exactly the opposite.
So what' s on the agenda?
Matinee of The Lion King?
Man, you really have it out for her, don' t you?
It must really burn your ass that with all your money and popularity... she still won' t have anything to do with you.
Face it, Kathryn -- she' s outclassed you.
How dare you talk to me like that, you son of a bitch?
Well, this has been fun.
Unfortunately, I have some work to do, and you have to go throw up.
After all, it was a very big salad you had for dinner.
- Oh, my God, I ate a crouton!
We' il see who gets the last laugh, brother dear.
Oh, no, I' m sorry!
I wasn' t thinking.
Sorry.
It' s okay.
It' s okay.
- Stop crying.
- Just don' t tell anyone.
Do they beat you here?
Please don' t tell anyone.
Min Lin, relax.
Christ, it' s like a fucking Godzilla movie.
- You girls know the routine?
- Seduce.
And destroy.
Shut up.
Mm, very nice.
Who the fuck are you?
And you?
I' m Sarah, and this is Gretchen.
We had a sleep over at Kathryn' s, and we' re running a little late.
Do you mind if we share your shower?
- Yeah.
Yeah, be my guest.
- Thank you.
Ooh, pass me the loofah.
So, what year are you guys?
- Cool.
How do you like Manchester, Sebastian?
It' s -- it' s unbelievably --
- Unbelievably what?
- Unbelievably hard.
- It certainly is.
- Rock hard.
Down, boy.
So, you guys sisters?
More like kissing cousins.
Slippery when wet.
So, you' re seeing Danielle Sherman?
Who?
Oh, yeah, yeah, trying to.
- She' s a sweet girl.
- You guys would make a great couple.
Just too bad you' re gonna miss out on all the action.
- What action?
With the exception of Danielle, Manchester Prep' s a virtual whorehouse.
"If you don' t snort it, suck it."
- Careful.
- He splurged.
But you won' t have to worry since you' il be dating the headmaster' s daughter.
Guess not.
- See you on campus.
- Ring toss.
Score.
Yes!
Thanks for, you know, sharing.
- Here, sis, I' il dry you off.
- Thanks.
Shit.
Breakfast was late, my skirt is mussed... and I needed the car last night.
- I' m sorry, Miss Merteuil -- - No excuses!
Now, just because my mother is out of town does not mean you can slack off.
Each lapse, each oversight, will be reported.
Good, you haven' t left.
What' s this?
Saddam addressing the troops?
- No, it' s all right, Henry.
There, there, sir.
The perfect Windsor is an art.
- Rough night last night?
- There was a pea under my mattress.
- No, Henry, it was great.
It was a ten.
Can we go now, or do we send Kapoor in our place?
I almost forgot.
Here are your allowances.
Annual?
Semiannual?
- Weekly, of course.
- This is amazing.
The leftovers, sir.
It' s what I like to call mad money.
Yeah, mad.
Unless you use it to make someone happy.
For the Windsor and the advice.
Thank you very much.
Very kind.
Tutor me in French?
Oh, my gosh, am I glad I found you?
Look, I am flunking French, like tres flunking it.
D- minus.
- Have you been studying?
Of course, I study like crazy, but it just goes in one hole and out the other.
- You can!
You can tutor me.
Mom said I can pay you, unless that' s like too totally insulting... because, you know, we' ve got money, and you' re the headmaster' s daughter... and headmasters make, like, zilch.
Thanks.
Tutor me, please, please.
I' il pay you $200 an hour, $200.
Stop.
Of course I' il tutor you.
The money doesn' t matter.
Going rate will be fine.
God, why does everything have to be about money?
'Cause it' s cool.
- Do you hear a phone?
- Yeah.
Oh, wait.
Sounds like it' s coming from here.
- I don' t have a phone.
- You do now.
Oh, my God, so cool.
Is it your birthday or something?
- Do you like the phone?
I might, if it comes with an explanation.
It does, actually.
I think I may have real feelings for you.
- Just a second, okay?
- Sorry.
Her.
- Who' s her?
- Look, I can' t do this from a phone.
But it' s a good phone.
Digital.
- Where are you?
You can' t be too far.
- Look down.
Oh, it is Sebastian Valmont.
Don' t move.
I' m coming down there.
- Hey!
Where are you?
- Why?
- I' il look silly.
Close them now.
Danielle, wait!
The best laid plans sometimes suck.
Miss Merteuil.
- But I' m excused from gym.
Ballet, no.
Well, there must be something I can do to change your mind.
I think you' ve got the wrong guy.
Now get your ass to ballet.
Mr. Erwick.
- and ballet.
- I can' t do anything, all right?
Hargrove called me into his office.
He' s suspicious, I heard it in his voice.
- Why do you think that is?
- Well, I' m not sure.
The Disciplinary Committee, of course.
You stuttered and stammered like a completely whipped fool... and then when you voted, it was obvious you voted the way I wanted you to vote.
But that' s how you did want me to vote.
Oh, my God, I' m a mess.
I don' t know what to do anymore.
It' s a dirty old man' s catch- 22.
Get control of yourself.
I can' t.
I' m falling apart.
My wife doesn' t turn me on anymore, my kids hate me.
I should just quit.
Stop blubbering.
I' il go back to gym and ballet.
- The excuse slips were just a test.
The day will come when I' il need you for a favor -- a big favor -- and you' il do it without question.
Of course.
I worship you, Kathryn.
Worship works best on your knees, Steve.
Please be quiet.
I' m trying to imagine I' m with someone attractive.
Sorry.
Hello!
Anybody!
Oh, my God, she is terrible.
If it' s so bad here, why don' t you guys just quit?
It' s steady employment, sir.
We could be down in the 50s!
Or worse, Scarsdale.
Ladies there make me crazy!
All the time sending me to the market looking for gefilte.
My father -- fisherman for 20 years -- he never caught one gefilte.
What is a gefilte?
- Three kings.
- Man!
- That beats my two pairs.
- I got crap.
Full house, jacks over threes.
You win again, Master Sebastian.
You know, Henry, I really wish you' d quit with the "master" thing.
It shows privilege.
Yeah, well, what has it gotten me?
I poured all my money into gifts and didn' t get the girl.
Danielle hates my wealth or resents it or something.
Perhaps it' s not my place to speak, sir.
No, Henry, please.
I' m desperate here.
Well, maybe she doesn' t want to feel like she' s being bought.
- You think that' s it?
- I don' t know.
Women are complicated.
It' s been my experience, sir, that women are more interested... in the soul of a man than in his trappings.
What is going on around here?
I had to ring and ring.
And where were you, Frederick?
I paged you four times.
A cab!
I' m sorry, we were just --
Get out of here, all of you.
And you can be damned sure my mother' s gonna hear about this.
- No, she won' t.
- What did you say?
I ordered them to play cards.
Great year.
Blitzkrieg, wasn' t it?
Don' t get smart.
Whether you realize it or not, you are still a guest in this house.
You know, you treat these people like dirt.
No wonder they don' t respect you.
We pay them for service, not respect.
Maybe someday you' il learn that.
And one day you' il realize that they' re human beings.
Just give me a second here.
Party' s over.
You know, I don' t get it.
Look, if you hate your mother so much... why work so hard to be just like her?
Is that what you think I' m doing?
Well, you' re obviously trying to prove something to someone.
No one' s this mean, unless -- unless there' s a whole bunch of pain and suffering behind it.
You think you have it so tough, having to come into this strange house... with strange people -- try growing up here.
Try spending every moment of your life just making up for just being here.
- That doesn' t make any sense.
- No, it doesn' t, does it?
You want to fit in?
Guess what.
So do I.
What a mess.
- Sebastian?
It' s Cherie.
Danielle is totally, madly in love with you.
Madly in love with me?
She hates me.
- Every move I make is the wrong move.
- Yeah, but she told me stuff..
Every time she thinks about you, every time she sees you, she gets all moist. "Moist"?
Her eyes -- she gets tears in them.
But look, time' s running out.
You gotta move now.
She' il be in the city tonight -- dinner with her favorite aunt, Riverside Cafe.
I figure if you go there, bare your soul --
No gifts though.
She hates that money thing.
Hello?
Closet street performer.
Now you know all my secrets.
How did you know I was here?
Already know.
Cherie the blabbermouth.
Weird girl, but if you get beyond all the "totallys" and "oh, my Gods"... there' s real truth there.
- Let me come with.
I' il make sure you get home all right.
You can come as far as the station and only if you can do it without talking.
Not another word -- that' s my condition.
Condition accepted.
All right, all right!
Stop!
Stop playing.
You know, I think this is the most romantic city on earth -- millions of strangers meeting in restaurants, parks, sidewalks -- a romance born every five seconds, every heartbeat.
I mean, God, is this a great city or what?
This is exactly what I' m talking about.
You spout BS on a continuous basis.
- Say it!
I wanna know what happened at school, in the courtyard.
I kissed you, and you just ran off.
I' m crazy about you!
I' m trying everything I can to make you like me.
Be honest.
Why is that so difficult?
I don' t know.
Maybe I' m scared.
You know, I' m new here, right?
New to this city... new at school...
living in a house full of certifiable wackos... and I don' t have any friends... at least, any I can trust.
And I' m confused.
God' s honest truth, I' m in a state of perpetual confusion.
So what are you scared of?
Missing my train.
See you at school.
Bye.
As you know, your mother gets home tonight.
And you want me to keep quiet about the poker game.
I don' t like these ideas Sebastian' s putting in your head.
- Well, I' m offended.
Leave.
I' il finish alone.
Min Lin, wait.
Why don' t you and I get to know each other, like with Sebastian last night?
- Do I have to?
- Come on, it' il be fun.
Here.
I' il jump right in.
Where are you from -- China, Japan?
Cambodia actually.
Cambodia -- wonderful country.
And when did you come to our United States?
My family fled through Vietnam.
Ultimately, we were 1 20 crammed into a boat the size of your pantry.
Oh, my gosh, that reminds me of this time in Denver, coming home from Aspen.
We almost had to fly coach.
Anyway, so your family fled the Khmer Rouge?
Nothing subtle about that shade of rouge.
We do have a lot in common.
Will there be anything else, Miss Kathryn?
No, that' s all.
Oh, yes.
Very enlightening.
Bitch.
You got all your pronouns mixed up.
"Vous" is "you."
Unless it' s someone you' re crazy, madly in love with... in which case it' s "tu," as in you and Sebastian.
I swear, that thing with the phone -- so cool.
I would have piddled right there on the spot.
Oh, wait, did I show you my doodle?
- Excuse me?
- My doodle, my sketch.
- Just tell me:
I mean, do you really like him?
- Is it the real thing?
- Like I even know what that is.
Knees go weak, mouth goes dry... you get that little tingling feeling in that special place.
He' s just so slick, so sure of himself.
I have a lot of trouble trusting him.
He can' t just come out and talk to me, say what he' s really feeling... and neither can I.
Okay, chapter three.
Read the translation of the first passage. "Love is a sublime melting pot in which men and women are fused together.
The lover is a priest, the ravished virgin a trembling sacrifice. "
A priest and a virgin?
That' s sick!
Move.
Move.
- Hi, Mr. Nagao!
- Hello, ladies!
I make a special eel and cuke roll today.
It' s so sad about Mr. Washington.
I mean, the fact that they found a dead rat in that student' s sloppy Joe.
He' il never work again.
So, you never told us how it went with Cherie.
- Did you bury her?
- Let' s say she' s on her way to ruin.
- Everything' s set for this weekend.
Uh, duh.
I told my mom how much fun we had... and she invited you and your mom over for nonfat lattes.
Your mom told my mom that you can sleep over.
Okay, I gotta go.
Gordon Anderson promised he' d show me his one- eyed snake, whatever that is.
Okay, see you.
Wow, Kathryn, you really showed her.
Don' t say a word.
It' s my turn to explain.
All I' ve done is hound you about being honest... when I couldn' t do it myself.
- I' il say.
- No, let me finish.
You see... it was my first kiss.
I wanted it to be perfect and right and with the right boy... and, while you might have been the right boy, the rest was totally not right.
I embarrassed you.
I embarrassed myself.
Because I know you' re used to girls with all this experience... and you' ve probably been kissing girls forever... and that' s what I was afraid to tell you.
I happen to think this is wonderful, all right?
So you weren' t exactly up- front and honest.
Join the club.
I wanted it to be perfect... not the tail end of some prank.
Does that make any sense?
Yeah.
You know, some things can' t be orchestrated.
Some things have to be spontaneous, like a kiss.
Like the kiss we' re about to have right now.
Say something, quick.
I can' t.
I have to go.
Last bell.
Okay, but... just back away so I know you' re not running away.
That was wonderful -- just precious.
"I' ve never kissed a boy before -- I mean, the right boy... and you' ve probably been kissing girls forever."
You must feel like a terrible dope, leading on that poor, lovesick girl.
You don' t know what you' re talking about.
Here' s a prediction:
A few weeks of hand- holding and chaste smooching... and you' il be so bored and horny you' il mess the whole thing up.
Of course, I could wipe her off the map tomorrow.... but I think I' il let this little romance just flicker out all on its own.
I like the girl, okay?
You screw it up, and I' il screw you up.
Nobody ever threatens me.
I just did -- or weren' t you listening?
- You do realize this means war.
- Then war it is.
Lovely.
Well, I feel badly for you, I really do... but Byron needs to be groomed every day at 3: 00.
Well, you' il just have to reschedule your daughter' s birthday.
Now, I want him saddled and ready to ride when I arrive.
Don' t keep me waiting.
Idiot!
There' s a new student at Manchester -- Cherie Clayman.
Did she die?
- I take it you don' t like her.
- I can' t stand her.
She' s actually very sweet, so I' m turning her into the school slut.
- Well, she' s now your new best friend.
You' re not hitting up the Claymans for a donation to Manchester.
Sorry, Mother.
I think it' s an excellent idea.
- The Claymans will join us at 7: 00.
- You invited them here?
Mother, they' re from California.
Kathryn, I need this.
Just 20 million more and we can break ground on the Tiffany Merteuil Library.
Well, you ladies seem to be enjoying yourselves.
You must be tense, Sebastian.
Yeah, well, you' d be too if you were failing gym.
I mean, who ever heard of fencing as a sport?
Perhaps a massage would help.
I' ve never had a massage before.
You can have my table.
I' m suddenly not in the mood.
"Mycket," not "myckesh."
Kathryn, if you' re not going to say it correctly, don' t say it at all.
It just makes you look foolish.
Thank you for the correction, Mother.
Now, if you' il excuse me.
I think I could get used to this.
Dead puppies, dead puppies, dead puppies... old nuns in their underwear --
I thought you' d left.
- Is that Sonja or Ingrid?
- It' s Tiffany.
- I hope you enjoyed your massage.
- I think I' il go take a shower.
We' ve had so little time together, Sebastian.
We can' t be a happy family if we don' t get to know each other a little better.
You' re right, Mom.
We should talk more, Mom.
With your father working on the yacht so much, I' il have plenty of time for you.
You know, some nights he doesn' t even come home.
He loves that yacht.
I' m glad he found something he' s so committed to.
Well, the right woman will do that.
- And you think I' m the right woman?
- Definitely.
He' s a changed man.
Of course.
Without me he' d still be in Miami giving charters to geriatrics.
It' s not the money, it' s you.
He loves you.
You' re a smart boy, Sebastian.
You seem to understand your father very well.
I hope so.
So do I, because if you' re wrong, you' re both going to end up out on the street.
She spanked me.
Oh, that feels so good.
- Oh, yeah, you like that, huh?
- Dad, you here?
Fuck!
Hey, son, how' s it goin '?
- In bed already?
- Oh, it' s just a catnap.
What are you doing?
Oh, I' m just looking for the cat.
Here, puss, puss, puss, puss, puss.
I hope you' re not suggesting I' m having an affair.
- I' m not suggesting anything.
- I' m your father... and I will not be treated like a criminal!
Criminal.
You could have fooled me.
And behind door number three we have --
- Hello.
- Sebastian, meet Lilly... my first mate.
Lilly, I' m Sebastian, Edward' s son.
Oh, my God, you have your father' s eyes.
Are you a Libra?
Let' s just cut right to the chase, shall we?
He offered to sail you around the world, didn' t he?
How did you know?
Leave right now, or you' re grounded for a week.
- Did he tell you he' s married?
- I was waiting for the right time.
You lied to me?
More an error of omission.
You see, she' s very sick.
I may be single any day now.
Go to hell!
Sebastian, you think you could help me out here?
Okay, okay, I know we talked about this... but you' re a man, and you have to understand --
You have to understand.
It' s not just your life anymore, Dad, it' s mine too.
Don' t screw it up for me.
Absolutely.
The keys, please?
Now lie in it.
Well, this sucks.
I can' t believe I was so stupid.
I really thought your dad liked me.
It' s not your fault.
He' s the master of deceit.
He should be in the Pathological Liars' Hall of Fame.
He was in the Hall of Fame?
- Never mind.
- Sure.
- Why are men such jerks?
I mean, is it genetic or something?
You know, they promise you the world, that you' re the one for them... and that their wives don' t understand them anymore.
And I fall for it every time.
I' m like a doormat.
They' re always coming and going... and coming and going, and coming and --
My life sucks.
Lilly, you don' t need a man to be happy.
If you' re not happy alone, you' re not gonna be happy with someone else.
You' re a very attractive woman.
You could have anyone you want.
You just have to wait for the right guy to come along.
- You think I' m attractive?
- I think you' re beautiful.
You' re so sincere.
You' re not like your father at all.
Glad you were paying attention.
Do you wanna come back to my place?
I' d love to, but I have an oral report due in the morning.
Oh, I' m great at orals.
- Try me.
No, thank you.
Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah, I' il be fine.
Psycho.
Les too.
But we wanted more for Cherie, so when Les sold the biz... we decided to move to the Big Apple.
Oh, it' s no problem.
Our driver -- he takes me right there.
She' s asking you if you like it, honey.
Oh, yeah, it' s the best.
And Kathryn' s been, like, so super- nice.
You know, some girls -- they told me to stay away from her...
like she had permanent PMS or something.
Ew, gross!
But she' s been, like, totally awesome!
I can tell she' s going to be very popular.
- Oh, I won' t be as popular as you. - "Popular" is such a bore.
The important thing is school spirit, and nobody has as much as my mother.
I do a little work for the school fund- raising committee.
You are so modest.
Mother' s already raised half the money needed for the new school library.
How much money have you raised?
Well, she barely has to do anything.
The parents practically throw it at her.
Why do they throw money at you?
Because charity is smiled upon by the ladies who lunch.
You know -- the social ladder?
My mom said now that we' re rich... we gotta start climbing that thing.
- Isn' t she precious?
- Would you excuse me?
- Certainly.
So, how much money do you need?
Oh, I didn' t invite you over here to discuss fund- raising, Bunny... but if you' d care to make a donation, we' d certainly consider it.
Really?
Why, thank you.
My pleasure.
Oh, hi, honey.
I can explain this.
There' s no need to explain.
I know you love my mother very much.
Exactly.
And Sebastian and I are just getting close.
I know you' d never do anything to break up our happy home.
- Oh, no, never.
- So let' s make sure it stays happy.
I' il make reservations at 8: 00.
At 8: 45, an accordion player will pass by.
When he does, request "Under My Thumb" by the Rolling Stones.
Got it.
- While she' s listening... slip this on her finger, then kiss her -- eight seconds, no tongue.
Are you getting all this?
After dinner, grappa -- one glass -- then bring her home, make love to her -- two Viagra -- any questions?
Just in case, I' ve written it all down for you.
Now, who' s your favorite daughter?
You are.
What a shame.
Morning!
Great day, isn' t it?
Bite me, rich boy!
Ah, New York -- a wonderful town.
- You look fabulous.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
You ought to take some money, just in case you need a cab, miss the train --
I' il be fine.
- Come on, this is my job -- to worry.
- What' s wrong?
- Nothing.
Just thought about your mom.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Sebastian thought you' d like it better than the train.
I am so excited.
- I' ve never been on a horse before.
- Don' t worry.
I won' t let anything bad happen to you.
If I like it, then I' il have Daddy buy me a horse... then we can spend every weekend together.
You' il love it.
I promise.
Very good, Cherie.
Back on the horse now.
I think we' re ready to try advanced jumping.
I don' t know.
He keeps throwing me off.
I guess we' d better go back to the basics -- Manuela?
Nice horsey.
I want you to push up and down in the saddle -- that' s called posting.
Now we need to add the back and forth motion.
When you hit the saddle, push backward, then forward.
Up and down, back and forth, faster, faster.
Up and down, back and forth, faster, faster.
Good.
This time I want you to really grind into the saddle.
- Okay.
I think I' m getting it.
- Posting is fun.
- Faster, faster.
Really fun.
Are you okay?
I' ve never felt better.
Now I know why girls like horses.
Wait.
I don' t know if I' m ready for this.
- It' s cool.
- I' m sorry.
It' s just that yesterday was my first kiss... and now you' re practically touching my breast.
At this rate, your dick will be in my mouth by lunch.
Anyone for lunch?
I' m kidding.
Listen, Danielle, we can take this as slow as you want.
I like you.
I' ve no need to rush things.
That' s not my problem.
I want to rush things.
I' m tired of being the only virgin in the sophomore class at Manchester.
Are you telling me that everyone in the sophomore class has done it?
Well, it sure feels like it.
- Constantly.
- I mean, there' s one side of me... that wants you to throw me down right here and rip my clothes off.
Then there' s this other side of me that thinks I should wait till I' m married.
Which side should I choose, Sebastian?
You really want me to answer that?
Come on, be my friend.
I know exactly what you' re going through.
I struggle with my dark side every day.
But that was the old me.
Believe it or not, I have you to thank for it.
You showed me that it was okay to be a decent person.
How dark was your past?
Pitch black.
I' m thinking --
I think I' m falling in love with you.
But I' m afraid to take the chance to get hurt.
- I' m afraid of getting hurt too.
- Listen, let' s make a pact.
We' il take it slow, and we won' t hurt each other.
God, we sound like a cancelled television series.
You don' t have to do this.
I want to.
Hello?
Hi, Daddy.
I know, I' m running late.
Tell Aunt Gloria we can still make the 2: 00 mass.
Yeah, I' il call you when I get there.
I love you too.
It' s okay.
- Sorry.
Call me later?
- Sure.
- Toodles.
- Bye- bye.
Oh, my balls.
- Here' s something you might like.
- Dolce.
How '98 of you.
Do you carry any real fur?
No, all of our fur is faux.
Of course.
The animals -- how silly of me.
I figured you' d be here.
- What' s up?
- It' s about Sebastian.
Give me the dirt.
Your stepbrother has quite the checkered past.
I mean, the fact that he was able to pay off that overnight delivery guy... and switch his school file?
That' s impressive even by my standards.
- That' s just the tip of the iceberg.
- Well done.
Cash or charge?
- I' il be there in an hour.
The new James Van Der Beek film' s playing in town.
You' re sure your dad won' t mind?
No, he' s out of town for the night.
It' s just me and Mr. Whiskers. - "Mr. Whiskers"?
- My pussy, silly.
Okay, well, I' il see you soon.
Bye.
The school virgin' s home alone with her pussy, and I' m taking her to see Dawson.
God, I' ve become a total fag.
- I guess I misjudged you.
- What are you talking about?
How' d you get this?
I have my ways.
- Kathryn, I' m trying to start over -- - Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, please.
Spare me any sob stories.
Oh, dear.
I guess something like this... could destroy your squeaky- clean reputation at Manchester.
And that school psychologist' s report about your mom -- it' s too bad.
How will she pay for rehab when I tell Mommy where some of her money' s going?
- You' re playing with fire, Kathryn.
- Poor Sebastian' s mom is going to be... homeless and eating leftovers out of the garbage.
You don' t know what I' m capable of.
Yes, I do.
I read your file.
It turns me on.
- Fuck off.
- Going to see Danielle?
Leave her out of it!
Looks like we' ve hit a sensitive spot.
Do you really think you can change, Sebastian?
Face it:
You and I are two of a kind.
We' re just not cut out for good deeds.
I know the drill.
You' il date Danielle... probably sleep with her after -- what -- you think eight months?
And then you' il get bored, and you' il break her heart.
Why don' t you just spare her the pain?
Date you?
We could make a good team.
What do you plan on doing with my file?
Do I sense a merger in the air?
Perhaps.
You do realize you' re my stepsister.
You know what they say about incest.
Is there any line you won' t cross?
Only one: never in the butt.
That' s a good line.
The Bradys never had it so good.
- I can' t do this.
- Not with your pants on.
- I gotta go.
- You fucking pussy!
- What, is this about Danielle?
You don' t understand, Kathryn.
I love her.
- You have a funny way of showing it.
- Fuck you.
You can' t change.
- I can try.
- Well, you' re gonna die trying.
- Hello?
- Hello, Danielle?
- Sebastian, you' re soaking.
- We have to talk.
Well, come inside before you catch yourself pneumonia.
Thanks.
What' s wrong?
I don' t know, it' s --
It' s okay.
You can talk to me.
Go slow.
I just -- I feel like I' m losing it.
I gotta get outta school.
It' s Kathryn, isn' t it?
I don' t think I can beat her.
Sebastian, do you believe in a higher power?
- Do you believe that love conquers all?
- Yes.
Yeah.
It' s the only thing keeping me together.
- So you believe in our love?
- Yes, I believe in our love.
'Cause I sure as hell don' t.
What?
Fucking idiot.
Bravo.
- I told you I could do it.
- I should never have doubted you.
Don' t tell me you bought that virgin bullshit.
No, I saw you.
You were with your dad.
What he doesn' t know can' t hurt him.
I am the headmaster' s daughter.
Daddy' s little angel must keep up appearances.
- Holy fuck.
- Oh, don' t be such a baby.
You didn' t really think you were gonna win, did you?
- You' re welcome to join us.
You know what they say:
Two' s company, three' s a fuck load of fun.
Well, if you can' t beat 'em --
Who says you can' t beat 'em?
Share and share alike.
Sebastian -- Now you' il have something to write about.
Danielle.
- Oh, shit!
- Are you okay?
Oh, you really should try to be more careful.
Thank you.
Oh, my bike!
Could we offer you a ride home?
My mom said I' m not allowed to take rides from strangers.
Oh, it' s you.
I was just going to Danielle' s house.
- I' il take care of the bike.
- Oh, thank you so much.
I owe you huge.
- No problem.
- It' s Debbie, right?
- No, Cherie.
Whatever.
You know, Debbie, has anyone ever told you: you could be a model?
- Yeah.
- It' s too bad you' re not sexy.
I can be sexy.
Show me sexy.
That' s my special place.
Holy shit!
Now, children, are you sitting comfortably?
Then I' il begin
But it was all over in just seven days
All that long, long time ago none of the things we can see now the sun, the moon, the stars, the earth, the animals, and plants not a single one existed, only God existed and so only He could have created them, and He did
What a character he was!
I wonder whatever became of old...
I imagine he' s dead like all the rest
Ah!
Those were the days
Mr. Tuttle, your hair!
- Good morning, ma' am, we' ve come about..
Oh, yes, of course!
Come in!
I wasn' t expecting you so soon
- You are...
- and this is Edmund Tuttle - Pleased to meet you, ma' am
- You must be the gardener - That' s right, the gardener
- And this young lady is called Lydia - Have you had much experience in service?
Oh, don' t let that angel face fool you, ma' am, she' s older than she looks
Can you iron?
What' s the matter?
Has the cat caught your tongue?
She can' t talk, ma' am the poor little mite is a mute
But she' s a good little worker I can promise you that
Alright, alright, the other girl I had spoke too much anyway
Follow me, Mrs. Mills, you and the girl you will sleep in the attic room on top of the stairs
- And you Mr....
- Tuttle, ma' am
Tuttle, you could sleep in the shed around the back
As you can see, the housework has been rather neglected since the servants disappeared almost a week ago
- Into thin air
No notice, nothing!
They didn' t even collect their wages
- They... they just left us - What a strange thing to do
You' il soon find out there are times when this house isn' t exactly an ideal home
Hence my advertisement in the newspaper requesting honest, hardworking people
- Isn' t that right, Mr. Tuttle?
- Oh, aye, we' re very honest and... very hardworking
The kitchen, I have breakfast at eight, the children at nine
Lunch will be served at one and dinner at half past seven
And the master, ma' am?
The master went off to war a year and a half ago
I' ve had no news since the war ended
- Which of you does the cooking?
- I' m so sorry, ma' am
Which of you does the cooking?
You' il notice what I' m doing
In this house, no door must be opened without the previous one being closed first
It' s not as easy as it may seem
There are fifteen different keys for all of the fifty doors depending on which area of the house you' re in at the time
Mrs. Mills, from tomorrow onwards I will be leaving a set of keys in your charge
Yes, ma' am
Music room, that old piano was already here when we moved in
Please do not let the children thumb away on it, it sets off my migraine
Silence is something that we prize very highly in this house
That is why you will not find a telephone, a radio, or anything else that makes a racket
Oh, we don' t have electricity either
Let' s continue
Ma' am, there' s really no need to show us around the whole house, we...
Yes there is!
Because here, most of the time, you can hardly see your way
It' s often difficult to make out if there is a table, a chair a door, a sideboard or one of my children playing hide- and- seek
What do you mean, ma' am?
Perhaps I should introduce you to the children
Mr. Tuttle, you can see to the garden now
- You' il find tools in the shed - Yes, ma' am
You two could start closing the curtains
All of them
Come
I' il wake them, you wait here
Whatever you do don' t open the curtains
Wakey- wakey...
Now, come on, eyes closed hands together
Blessed be, at light of day Jesus to whom now I pray
Blessed be the Virgin pure whom I greet with faith so sure
Jesus, Mary spotless rose, keep us till this day doth close
- They' re still half asleep - What sweet little children
Well, what do you say?
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
How do you do, children?
My name is Mrs. Mills but you can call me Bertha, if you like
- Anne - Nicholas
- Anne and Nicholas, what pretty names - Are you going to be our new nanny?
Yes, my dears I' m your new nanny
It' s time for their breakfast
Lydia, go to the kitchen and close every shutter
- The doctors were never able to find a cure - For what?
Their condition...
Children have a very serious allergy to light
They' re photosensitive and must never be exposed to any light much stronger than this
Otherwise, in a matter of minutes they will break out in sores and blisters and begin to suffocate it would eventually be fatal
Good heavens!
- I don' t like this toast - Oh?
Why not?
It tastes funny I liked it better before
That was because, before, somebody else made it
- When are they coming back?
- They' re not coming back, child
- Just like daddy - Daddy is coming back, though
Mrs. Mills, our father is fighting in a war in France, you know
- I know, but he' s in France
That' s enough chatterboxes finish up your breakfasts
- Are you going to leave us too?
- Of course not!
- Why should I leave you?
But they did and then it happened
- Be quiet!
- What do you mean, Anne, what happened?
- Mommy went... mad - Nothing happened!
- No, it didn' t!
- Yes, it did!
- Be quiet!
What' s going on?
I want to see those plates empty in less than a minute, is that clear?
Mrs. Mills, would you come outside a moment?
I' d like a word with you
Yes, ma' am
The postman usually comes every Wednesday
But I just checked the letter box and this week he hasn' t
I' m afraid I don' t follow, ma' am
It' s an advertisement for servants
Since it was never published, would you mind explaining to me what you' re doing here
Now I understand
Well, ma' am, that' s exactly what I was going to say to you when you opened the door to us
The truth is that we just come by on the off- chance
You know, a big house like this is always in need of someone who knows the ropes
You mean you' ve served in a house like this one before?
- Here?
- Oh no, it was a few years ago
If you don' t mind my saying so, ma' am they were the best years of my life
That' s why we come by, because this house means a lot to us
Perhaps I' d best show you our references, ma' am
No, no, no, don' t bother there' s no need, ah so you say you know the house well?
Like the back of my hand
Well that is always assuming that the walls haven' t sprouted legs and moved in the meantime
The only thing that moves here is the light
But it changes everything
It' s rather difficult, to say the least
One might almost say unbearable
The only way of enduring it is by keeping a cool head
Oh, yes ma' am
I don' t like fantasies, strange ideas, do you know what I mean?
I think so, ma' am
My children sometimes have strange ideas
But you mustn' t pay any attention to them
- Children will be children - Yes, of course, ma' am
Alright, you can stay
Thank you very much, ma' am
It did happened
"To make them change their minds" full stop...
Afterwards....
He ordered them to be beaten, but Justus and Pastor, far from being afraid rejoiced and showed themselves willing to die for Christ
When he saw this, the Roman governor was filled of rage and ordered their heads to be cut off
What do you find so amusing?
- Well - Well what?
- Those children were really stupid - Why?
Because they said they only believed in Jesus and then they got killed for it
Deny Christ?
Well, yes, inside I would' ve believed in him but I wouldn' t have told the Romans that
Is that what you think too, Nicholas?
I see!
So you both would have lied to the point of denying Christ
Oh, you would' ve saved your heads being chopped off by the Romans, that' s true
- When?
In the next life!
The one that' s waiting for us after we die, where would you have gone?
- Oh - Oh
- Where, Nicholas?
- To the children' s Limbo
What is the children' s Limbo, Anne?
- One of the four hells!
- Which are?
Me!
- No, no, no, let him answer, which are?
There' s the hell where the damned go then there' s purgatory and the Bosom of Abraham, where the Just go and Limbo where children go
At the center of the Earth where it' s very, very hot
That' s where children go who tell lies, but they don' t just go there for a few days
They' re damned forever!
Think about it!
Try to imagine the end of eternity
Close your eyes, close your eyes and try to imagine it, forever
- Pain, forever - I' m getting dizzy
Now do you understand why Justus and Pastor told the truth?
Right, open your readers at lesson six
- You most certainly cannot
First you' re going to read the lesson, then you' re going to learn it by heart
All of it?
Anne, any more protests and there will be no playing for you at all today
- No!
No!
Yes!
We get scared if we' re separated
You get scared?
As if you weren' t used to this house by now
What if we see a ghost?
I haven' t told him anything!
Well if you see a ghost, you say "hello" and you continue on studying
Why me?
Because I say so!
Now come on! take your book
Nicholas, I want to see that lesson learned in less than an hour
- What?
- Give me a kiss - Give me a kiss!
Give me a kiss!
- Anne, wait for me outside - You know I can' t
Over there
Mrs. Mills, close all the curtains my daughter is going to cross the living room
Yes, ma' am
Alright, Anne
Darling, mommy can' t be with you all the time
You must learn to be on your own, where' s your rosary?
I want you to squeeze it with all your might and say "Our Father"
- And then your fear will go away - It won' t
Yes!
Yes, it will, honestly
Don' t you see that when you do that the Lord is with you?
There' s no reason to be afraid
The house and the family
We all live in a house with our family
The family is usually made up of parents, children, and their grandparents
We must be obedient and kind...... and kind towards other members of our family and we must never argue or fight with our brothers and sisters
- Do you have any children?
- No
Mr. Tuttle and the girl, Lydia, are all I' ve got and I' m all they' ve got
- Was she born like that?
- Beg your pardon, ma' am?
- The girl, was she born a mute?
You know, I think I finished here, ma' am
If you' il excuse me, I think I' il go and see if Mr. Tuttle needs a hand
Nicholas!
I' m coming!
- What' s the matter?
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn' t crying, I was reading
But I just heard you...
Anne!
Anne!
Anne?
- I haven' t learned it yet, mommy - Are you all right?
Yes
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn' t crying
But I just heard you a moment ago there' s no need to feel ashamed, darling
If I' d been crying, I' d tell you
- Oh, really?
So I imagined it, did I?
- What boy?
- Victor
- Who' s Victor?
- The boy who was here a moment ago
I told him to let me study but he wouldn' t stop crying
I think he' s a spoiled brat!
He said we have to leave the house
Did he now?
Why was he crying?
Because he doesn' t like this house but he has to live here
His father is a pianist, is he?
Yes, and I' ve already told him that he' s not allowed to touch the piano
He isn' t, is he, mommy?
- So you' ve spoken to his father as well?
- No, only with Victor
His father is with the others in the hall
But I' ve just come from the hall there' s no one there
They must have gone upstairs they' re viewing the house
That' il do, Anne!
That' s enough!
- Now, why were you crying?
- So where is he now?
- He went down through there!
Would you mind telling me, how a boy can get in and out of this room if it' s locked?
No door is to be opened without the previous one being closed first
Is that so hard to understand?
This house is like a ship, the light must be contained as if it were water by opening and closing the doors!
- But ma' am, I...
Do not argue with me!
Be quiet!
Lydia?
She hasn' t got a key I already told you that
- That leaves you then - But I was in the hall the whole time and then I went out into the garden you saw me with your own eyes
I hope you are not suggesting that it was me!
Do you think that I would overlook such a thing and endanger the life of my own daughter?
We' re not supposed to read at the table
Oh, really?
And who' s going to tell mommy?
You?
Or perhaps you!
- Did you really see a boy?
- Yes, he' s called Victor
- Is he a ghost?
- Ghosts aren' t like that - What are they like?
I' ve told you a thousand times they go about in white sheets and carry chains
How do you know?
Because I' ve seen them, they come out at night
Where?
- You' re stupid - Not half as much as you
But I don' t believe you saw that boy
Believe what you like, you' il soon be begging us to play with you
- Nicholas, Nicholas - What?
- Look - Why have you opened the curtains?
- It wasn' t me!
- Who was it then?
It was Victor he' s been doing it all night
- You' re a liar, I' m going to tell mommy - So I' m a liar, am I?
Yes
Victor, come out from behind that curtain so my stupid brother can see you!
- Leave me alone!
- So you don' t want to see him now, eh?
You' re a cowardly custard... cowardly, cowardly custard, cowardly cowardly custard
Well, I' il just have to do it myself, then
That' s enough, Victor!
Nicholas, Nicholas, tell him to leave the curtains alone, he won' t listen to me
- Stop it!
Get off my bed, both of you - This is our bed!
No, it' s mine!
Anne, please stop putting on that voice
You be quiet, cowardly custard
Listen, if you don' t stop I' il call my mother and she' il kick you out
- You don' t know my mother - And you don' t know my parents!
Anne, I' m going to tell mommy about you!
Don' t be stupid!
Can' t you see it' s not me?
Victor, touch his cheek so he knows you' re real
Help!
Mommy!
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
She was frightening me and I told her to be quiet
I' m fed up, do you hear me?
I am fed up with you!
I didn' t do anything
Therefore, the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken
So he drove out the man, and placed at the east of the Garden of Eden Cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life
- There, I' ve finished!
- Very good
- What?!
That' s not what we agreed - We didn' t agree anything, young lady
Today, you' re being punished and you' il do as I say
How dare you?
Mommy, I won' t ask forgiveness for something I didn' t do!
- There was!
- You' re lying!
I am not!
Anne!
Anne, do you remember the story about Justus and Pastor?
That' s what you say
But I read the other day that Limbo is only for children who haven' t been baptized
And I have!
And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac, his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together
Isaac spoke unto Abraham, his father and said: my father and he said: here I am, my son and he...
- Yes, ma' am
The little angel is fast asleep
What about Anne?
Is she still on the stairs?
Yes, ma' am
I prefer to have her where I can see her but I can' t embroider in such poor light
How long is this punishment going to go on, it' s been three days now
It' s up to her
She' s got to learn to swallow her pride and ask for forgiveness
Anyway, it' s about time she started to read the Bible
Well, the priest will be very pleased to hear that, ma' am
If he ever deigns to pay us another visit
He knows perfectly well that the children can' t go out
He told me yesterday he' il be by as soon as possible
I' m beginning to feel totally cut off from the world
This fog doesn' t exactly help it' s never lasted this long before
- That' s true, ma' am - Even the sea gulls have gone quiet
Anne?
Anne, I can' t hear you
Incidentally, Mrs. Mills
I' ve had to put up with the noise of Lydia running around above my head
She' s, he' s been hurdling backwards and forth as if there were three of her
Would you kindly tell her it' s not necessary to kick up quite such a rumpus just to do a little cleaning
I couldn' t bear to get another migraine attack
- I' il tell her, ma' am - Thank you
Now she' s really gone too far, Lydia!
- Nothing, mommy
I' m just reading like you told me
- Hear what?
And the Angel of the Lord called on to Abraham out of heaven a second time and said: by myself, I have sworn, saith the Lord...
- Who was that?
- I don' t know
Anne, tell me who' s making that noise
- I can' t tell you, mommy - You tell me
I told you there was someone in the room and you punished me!
- Now, I don' t know what to say - Anne, I want the truth
Tell me if there is someone upstairs
There, in that junk room
Mommy, you' re letting the light in!
- She' s what?
- She' s watching
- They just came past here
- Didn' t you see them?
- Which way did they go?
Over there, over there oh, and down there as well
They' re everywhere they say this house is theirs and they said they' re going to take the curtains down as well
- Ma' am, stay calm, please - I will not stay calm!
I' ve managed to avoid a single Nazi ever stepping foot in this house and now there is someone here under my nose, opening and closing the doors!
Ma' am, this is a very old house, the floorboards squeak and the plumbing clanks
There were voices, I' m telling you a boy and two women
- and they were talking together - Mommy!
Mommy look!
I did it yesterday!
- and this is the old woman - What do these numbers stand for?
That' s the number of times I' ve seen them
I' ve seen the old woman the most
God in heaven!
Mrs. Mills go and call Mr. Tuttle
- Before it gets dark - Yes, ma' am
- Mommy!
- Yes, darling, it' s alright
Nothing is going to happen to you while mommy is here
Look, mommy she really scares me
It' s as if she' s not looking at you but she can see you
And she' s always around saying: "come with me"
- Oh, Anne, don' t lie to me!
- Honestly, mommy and she asked me things
Victor told me she' s a witch
- What did she ask you?
- Things
Her breath smells
We have to open all the curtains
I don' t want any dark corners where someone could hide
- Yes, ma' am - You both search the right side and I' il take the left then we' il search upstairs
Perhaps they' re ghosts who lived in this house before
Don' t be stupid, I' ve already told you ghosts go about in white sheets and carry chains and go oooo!
Now, Anne, why do you make up such stories?
I don' t, I read them in books
Well, you shouldn' t believe everything that you read in books
That' s what our mother says
She says that all this stuff about ghosts is rubbish and then she expects us to believe everything written in the Bible
- And don' t you believe it?
- I believe some things
But, for example, I don' t believe that God made the world in seven days
And I don' t believe that Noah got all those animals into one boat or the Holy Spirit is a dove
- No, I don' t believe that either - Doves are anything but holy
They pooh on our windows
Have you mentioned any of this to your mother?
- Ma' am - Yes?
We' ve searched everywhere, ma' am, there' s no one
I see
- Mrs. Mills?
- Yes, ma' am?
Do you have any idea what this might be?
- It' s a photograph album, ma' am - No but look, they' re all asleep
- Look - They' re not asleep, ma' am, they' re dead
It is a book of the dead
In the last century, I believe they used to take photographs of the dead in the hopes that their souls would go on living through the portraits
There are even group portraits
And children!
Oh, it' s macabre!
How could these people be so superstitious?
Grief over the death of a loved one can lead people to do the strangest things
Get rid of it, I don' t want it in the house
Yes, ma' am
Mrs. Mills, it' s cold why don' t you come and sit by the fire?
Thank you very much, ma' am
So, tell me about when you worked here before
Did you have to look after children then as well?
No, I was in charge of organizing the house work
- Were there many servants?
- Oh, about fifteen
- Why?
- My employers moved to London
They came here less and less it... being so out of the way like
So gradually the house just became empty
Everybody ends up leaving this damned island
My family left in the summer of 1940 just before the invasion
That was the last I' ve heard of them
I don' t blame them
Naturally, we left too
Although, you know, sometimes when you leave a place it' s like it' s there with you all the time
I always felt like I never left this house
Why did you leave?
Oh, it was on account of the tuberculosis, the whole area was evacuated
- Was that when Lydia went dumb?
- Yes, I think so
Though you know, my memory is a bit rusty these days, ma' am
What happened to her?
Well, suddenly one day, she just... stopped talking
Well, there must have been a reason, people don' t just stop talking
These things are always the result of some sort of trauma
Something must have happened to her
Did your employers treat you well?
Oh, they were always very kind to us, they treated us just like family
I' il never be able to get up in the morning
Off you go, I' m going to stay here a while longer
Yes, ma' am
I' m sorry I was so hard on you
Can you forgive me?
Anne?
- Mommy?
- What?
- When is daddy coming home?
Why did he go to war?
I mean, nobody has done anything bad to us
Daddy went... daddy went because he' s very brave and because he wasn' t prepared to let the Germans tell him what he had to do
Why?
Where are you?
Mrs. Mills!
Mrs. Mills!
- What' s the matter, ma' am?
- Quickly!
- What' s happening, ma' am?
Come on!
Oh my God!
I checked that room myself, it was empty
- and yet...
- They will do you good
And yet I felt as if there was someone else there and it wasn' t human
There is something in this house, something diabolic
- Ma' am - Something which is not... not at rest
I know you don' t believe it, you don' t believe it, do you?
I don' t blame you, I, I used to not believe these things
I do believe it, ma' am I' ve always believed in those things
Oh, they' re not easy to explain but they do happen
We' ve all heard stories of the beyond now and then and I think that sometimes the world of the dead gets mixed up with the world of the living
But it' s impossible the Lord would never allow such an aberration
The living and the dead they will only meet at the end of eternity
It says so in the Bible
Ma' am, there isn' t always an answer for everything
Where are you off to, ma' am?
I' m going to the village to pay father Legrand a visit
If he won' t come here then I shall go to him, I shall bring him back
I' ve waited long enough
- Ma' am, the priest told me that...
- I don' t care what he told you
I want him to tell me personally
- He must come today - But what are you going to tell him?
We have searched every room in there inch by inch and now I need them to be blessed
Ma' am, please wait it is still very early
- Mr. Tuttle - Good morning, ma' am
I need you to search the whole garden for gravestones
- Yes
When my husband bought this house we were told there was a little cemetery
I think it was somewhere over there among the trees
- I' ve not seen anything - Check carefully
- They could be overgrown - Yes, ma' am
I need to know if there was a family buried here and if they had a little boy, Victor
Now she thinks the house is haunted
Do you think it' s safe to let her go?
Oh, don' t worry, the fog won' t let her get very far
Oh, yes, the fog!
The fog, of course!
And when... when do you think we should bring all this out into the open?
All in good time, Mr. Tuttle, all in good time
Charles?
Grace
You' re here!
You' re here!
They said there was no hope
They said I should give you up for dead
They say a lot of things
Thank you!
Thank you, God!
Thank you!
Every night I' ve prayed for this! begging God to bring you back
Bring my children their father back!
But where have you been all this time?
Out there, looking for my home
So different!
Sometimes I bleed
Ma' am?
Mrs. Mills, this is my husband
- I' m very pleased to meet you, sir - He' s very weak
- And something to eat - Right away, ma' am
Hello, my little ones
Daddy!
Why did you take so long?
Hello, Nicholas
I told you he' il come back!
- Have you both been well behaving?
- We' ve been very good
- Very good
We study every day for our First Communion
Daddy, did you kill anyone?
Oh, here he comes
Darling, we' ve prepared lunch for you!
Are you coming down or would you prefer that...
- Be patient, Anne
Daddy is... not well
He said he' d seen a lots of dead men
Mommy, when people die in the war where do they go?
What a question!
On what?
Well, on whether they fought on the side of the goodies or the baddies
Your father, for example, fought for England on the side of the goodies
How do you know who the goodies and the baddies are?
That' s enough questions, eat your food you' il never go to war
We' il never go anywhere
Oh, you' re not missing out on anything
You' re much better off at home with your mommy and your daddy who love you very, very much
- And the intruders?
- There are no intruders here
- But you said that there were...
- No, I said that there are no intruders here and I don' t want to hear another word on the subject
- That is enough!
- Can I say something?
- Why not?
- Because... because you can' t
Anne, stop breathing like that
You heard me!
Stop it!
Stop breathing!
Go to your room!
There' s no dessert for you today!
No crying!
Oh, stop that, look what an awful face you' ve got when you cry
- I don' t care!
There!
You listen to me
- I' ve seen them too - You have?
Yes
Then why don' t you tell my mother?
Then maybe she' il believe me
There are things your mother doesn' t want to hear
She only believes in what she was taught
But don' t worry, sooner or later she' il see them
- Then everything will be different - How?
Oh, you' il see!
There are going to be some big surprises
- There are going to be... changes - Changes?
Now she' s behaving as if nothing had happened
- What about her daughter?
- Oh, she' s not so stubborn
The children will be easier to convince
No, it' s the mother who' s going to cause us problems
But do you think her husband suspects anything?
No, I don' t think he even knows where he is
Look what a pretty daughter I' ve got
Mommy made this veil especially for you
- I look like a bride - Yes, you do
I need to shorten the sleeves a little
- You can take it off now - No!
Anne, this dress has to be spotless for your First Communion
I promise I won' t dirty it
Oh!
Just a little!
Alright, I' il be back shortly
No!
Monsieur, would you like to dance?
I' d love to!
Charles, you can' t go on like this
You must eat something
Anne, you need to take the dress off now
Anne, are you listening to me?
Anne?
But it' s clean
It makes no difference why can' t you ever do as you' re told...
- What' s the matter?
- Where is my daughter?
- What have you done with my daughter?
- Are you mad?
I am your daughter!
You' re not my daughter!
You' re not my daughter!
- She wants to kill me!
She won' t stop until she kills us!
She won' t stop until she kills us
- Hush, child, come with me - You' re wicked!
You' re wicked!
- How is she?
- There' s no calming her
So I left her with her father she insisted on speaking with him
What happened?
Why did you fight?
It wasn' t her!
It was the old woman with the strange eyes
She was imitating my daughter' s voice
I swear to God that it wasn' t my daughter!
God, help me!
What' s the matter with me?
I don' t know what' s the matter with me
You must get more rest
You can' t take on the whole responsibility of this house
Leave it to us we know what has to be done
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean you know what has to be done?
Nothing, ma' am I was just suggesting...
There' s nothing to suggest
Who do you think you are?
You have no idea what has to be done!
Or do you...
What are these?
The tablets for your migraine, ma' am, the ones you always take
Please, I need to be on my own
Yes, ma' am
Come, child
Anne told me everything
I wish I had an explanation but I haven' t
First I thought there was someone else in the house even thought that they were ghosts
I' m not talking about the ghosts I' m talking about what happened that day
- I don' t know what you' re talking about - Tell me it' s not true
- Tell me what happened - Happened?
I don' t know what came over me that day, I...
The servants had left during the night they hadn' t the courage to tell me to my face
And they knew that I couldn' t leave the house
They knew!
Anne?
Anne, what happened?
She hit me
She went mad like she did that day, do you remember?
No
- You must forgive me, Charles - Not me, the children
They know that I love them they know I' d never hurt them
I' d die first!
What are you going to do?
Are you angry with me?
I just came back to say goodbye to my wife and children
- Now I must go - Go where?
- To the front - The war is over!
- The war is not over - What are you talking about?
You' re not going!
You left us once already!
Why?
Why did you have to go to that stupid war that had nothing to do with us?!
Why couldn' t you have stayed here like the others did?
- They surrendered - We all surrendered!
The whole island was occupied what.. what did you expect?
What were you trying to prove by going to war?
Your place was here with us, your family
I loved you, that was enough for me
Living in this darkness, in this prison
But not for you I wasn' t enough for you
It wasn' t just the war
You want to leave me, don' t you?
Grace
Anne!
Nicholas!
What is it?
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Where are the curtains?
Mrs. Mills!
Let me see!
Let me see!
You' re alright!
I want my daddy
- Daddy' s gone - It' s not true!
Yes, it is, it is true
I love you, mommy
Find the curtains
Who was it?
Who did this?
Tell me!
Tell me!
You know what' s happening here! you know because it happened to you too!
Write it down!
Write it down!
Please!
That attitude won' t solve anything, ma' am
- Where are they?
- What?
The curtains!
The curtains my children' s lives depend on!
Someone has taken the curtains!
I have noticed, ma' am, there' s no need for you to raise your voice
Oh, Mr. Tuttle, I was just on the point of calling you
Did you know that someone has taken all the curtains?
The curtains?
Oh, dear!
Why should anyone want to take all the curtains?
Oh, to let some daylight into this house, I imagine
Daylight, of course
Someone wants to kill my children
Now why do you think that the daylight would kill them?
Are you mad?
I told you!
I already told you, the children are photosensitive, the light will kill them!
Yes, but that was before, the condition could' ve cleared up by itself
I mean, if you never expose them to daylight, how do you know they' re not cured?
Then one fine day... they disappeared
I' m going to find those curtains and when you have finished helping me hang them, you will leave this house
And what about the master, ma' am?
What does he have to say about all of this?
Give me your keys!
I want your keys now!
I know what you want, you want to frighten us
You want to get us out me and my children
You' ve wanted to take over this house ever since the first day you arrived
Now, you give me those keys, I will not ask again
Give them to me!
And now, get out of here
You know something, Mr. Tuttle?
I think I' ve reached the end of my tether
- What about you?
- Oh, yes, definitely
We' d better go and uncover the gravestones
What' s mommy doing?
I' ve already told you she' s gone mad
- She' s gone mad!
Liar!
She' s gone mad!
- She' s gone mad!
Liar!
- Night time - Where are you going?
I' ve had enough
I' m going to the woods to look for daddy
Are you going to run away?
If I hang on to the pipe, I can climb down to the ground, it' s very easy
If mommy finds out you' re in for it
Yes, yes, yes
Anne, wait!
I want to come and look for daddy too
Liar, you just don' t want to be left on your own, scaredypants, scaredypants!
Be quiet!
Anne, I think we' ve gotten lost
We still haven' t left the garden yet, silly
- I' m scared - You shouldn' t have come, then
- Say something - What shall I say?
I don' t know, anything
Let' s see, my name is Anne and I' m walking
I' m walking and my name is Anne...
What' s that over there?
- I think they' re graves - Don' t go near!
- Why not?
- What if a ghost jumps out?
Graves don' t have ghosts only skeletons
- There' s something written here - Let' s go!
Wait!
Anne, what does it say?
- You must be strong now, children - Nicholas, come here!
Mrs. Mills, please don' t tell mommy we' ve run away
- Why?
- They' re dead!
- What?
- They' re ghosts, please come here!
Children!
Nicholas!
I don' t care what I said!
Get away from them
You' re always teasing me and telling lies
I' m telling the truth!
Come here!
Quick!
Children!
Run!
Go!
Into the house!
Don' t come any closer!
Don' t move!
Don' t trouble yourself, ma' am tuberculosis finished us off more than half a century ago
Go away!
- Open the door ma' am, please - What do you want?
Mommy, don' t open the door, don' t
- We' ve seen their graves - Go upstairs and hide
- I' m scared!
Don' t separate
Go!
Go!
- We' ve been trying to make you understand - Understand what?
About the house... about the new situation
What situation?
We must all learn to live together, the living and the dead
If you' re dead, leave us in peace!
Leave us in peace!
Leave us in peace!
In here, get inside
- Who?
- The intruders
- There are no intruders - They took the curtains down
- There are no intruders - Oh, yes, I assure you it was them
And now they' re in there with you and the children
Yes!
And believe me, sooner or later, they' il find you
Listen, wait here and I' il be back in a minute
No, no, no, mommy said we shouldn' t separate
I can' t leave her on her own
Stop breathing like that!
Nicholas, stop breathing like that!
Stop breathing!
Can' t you hear it?
There' s someone there
Come with us...
Come with us
Nicholas?
Anne?
Where are you?
Answer me!
- The intruders have found them - There' s nothing we can do now
You' il have to go upstairs and talk to them
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses
Why are you afraid, children?
Why don' t you want us to be your friends?
Come on, speak to us, speak to us
Tell me what happened
Don' t tell her!
"Don' t... tell... her"
If I tell her, they' il leave us in peace
Mommy!
"Mommy"
Why are you crying, children?
What happened in this room?
What did your mother do to you?
- Something about a pillow - Is that how she killed you?
With a pillow?
She didn' t kill us!
Children, if you' re dead why do you remain in this house?
We' re not dead!
- We' re not dead!
- We' re not dead!
- We' re not dead!
We' re not dead!
- We' re not dead!
We' re not dead! "
- We' re not dead!
We' re not dead!
We' re not dead!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, just a bit dizzy, that' s all
- What happened?
- They made contact
- Apparently
Yes, the mother and the two children
- Interesting?
- I was scared out of my wits!
No!
So far we have handled this matter your way
But now, you listen to me, we can' t possibly stay in this house any longer
It is quite clear that these beings do not want us to live here!
Yes, we do!
We know the woman went mad, smothered her two children and then shot herself
That' s quite enough, think of our son!
- There' s nothing wrong with Victor!
He has nightmares!
He says he has seen that girl!
And even this lady has been possessed by her!
- Please, let us leave this house!
- All right, we will leave tomorrow morning
Oh, thank God for that I' il just go and check on Victor
A pleasure, I hope we' ve been of some help
Oh yes, of course but I must admit that was not the most...
At first I couldn' t understand what the pillow was doing in my hands
And why you didn' t move but then I knew...
I' d killed my children
I got the rifle, I put it to my forehead and I pulled the trigger
Nothing...
Then I heard your laughter in the bedroom
You were playing with the pillows as if nothing had happened
"Be strong, be a good mother... for them"
What does all this mean?
Where are we?
Young Lydia said the very same thing when she realized the 3 of us were dead
And that was the last time she ever spoke
But I couldn' t tell you that before now
Shall I make us a nice cup of tea, ma' am?
The intruders are leaving, but others will come
Now sometimes we' il sense them and other times we won' t
But that' s the way it' s always been
Ma' am
Mommy... daddy died in the war, didn' t he?
- Yes - Will we ever see him again?
I don' t know
If we' re dead, where' s Limbo?
I don' t know if there even is a Limbo
I' m no wiser than you are but I do know that I love you
I' ve always loved you
And this house is ours, you say with me:
- This house is ours - This house is ours
- This house is ours - This house is ours
Mommy... look it doesn' t hurt anymore
No one can make us leave this house
Come along, Victor
Under blue moon, I saw you
So soon you' il take me
Up in your arms, too late to beg you
Or cancel it though I know it must be
The killing time
Unwillingly mine
Fate
Up against your will
Through the thick and thin
He will wait until
You give yourself to him
ln starlit nights I saw you
So cruelly you kissed me
Your lips a magic world
Your sky all hung with jewels
The killing moon
Will come too soon
Fate
Up against your will
Through the thick and thin...
I' m voting for Dukakis.
Well...
Maybe when you have children of your own who need braces and you can' t afford them because half of your husband' s paycheck goes to the Federal Government, you' il regret that.
My husband' s paycheck?
Anyway, I' m not going to squeeze one out till I' m, like, 30.
Will you still be working at the Yarn Barn?
I hear that' s a great place to raise children.
That' s really funny.
No, I think a year of partying is enough.
She' il be going to Harvard next fall.
Mom, I haven' t even gotten in yet.
Do you honestly think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country till you' re ready to squeeze one out?
Yeah, I do.
- When can I squeeze one out?
- Not until 8th grade.
Excuse me?
Donnie, you' re such a dick.
Whoa, Elizabeth!
A little hostile there.
Maybe you should be the one in therapy.
Then Mom and Dad can pay someone $200 an hour to listen to your thoughts so we don' t have to.
Okay.
You want to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication?
- You' re such a fuck- ass!
- What?!
Please.
Did you just call me a "fuck- ass"?
- Elizabeth, that' s enough.
- You can go suck a fuck.
Tell me, Elizabeth, how does one suck a fuck?
- You want me to tell you?
- Tell me.
We will not have this at the dinner table.
- Fuck.
What' s a fuck- ass?
I' m reading.
Get out of my room.
Where do you go at night?
Would you just get out of my room?
Did you toilet paper the Johnsons' house?
Is that what you came in here to ask me?
No.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.
What happened to my son?
I don' t recognize this person today.
Then why don' t you start taking the goddamn pills?
Bitch.
Our son just called me a bitch.
You' re not a bitch.
You' re bitchen, but you' re not a bitch.
I want to be a President of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug- running Panamanian dictator.
- That we never again...
- Dukakis! funnel aid to the Contras through convicted drug dealers.
Son of a bitch.
Panama is a friendly country.
I went down and talked to the President of Panama...
- Tell him, George! - about cleaning up their money laundering.
And Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time.
When the evidence was there, we indicted him.
Wake up.
I' ve been watching you.
Come closer.
Closer.
28 days... six hours... 42 minutes... 12 seconds.
That is when the world will end.
Why?
Son?
Son.
Donnie Darko?
Donnie Darko.
What the heck' s going on here?
- Who is it?
- It' s Eddie Darko' s kid.
I' m sorry about this, Jim.
He' s a neighborhood kid.
Guess he was sleep- golfing?
Watch out for that drool spot.
Are you all right, son?
So, let' s stay off the links at night, okay?
I' m sorry, Dr. Fisher.
It won' t happen again.
Dr. I hate kids.
Let' s golf.
Let' s go, fire it up!
Donnie, Donnie, Donnie!
What happened to your house?
- No one' s allowed.
- This is my house.
- I said - - This is my house!
He' s okay.
... Channel 6 News.
We have just arrived on the scene...
Wait a minute.
Here' s your brother.
It fell in your room.
Ms. Darko, I' m Bob Garland.
I' m with the F. A. A.
- The what?!
- I' m with the F. A. A.
We' d like to speak to you and your husband privately.
- In private?
- Please.
All right.
And... here.
- You got it.
- All right.
We have arranged for you to stay at a hotel.
Get some sleep and we will take care of things here.
- Great.
- Thank you.
Kids, come on, we' re going to a hotel.
They don' t know where it came from.
Local and national transportation authorities have begun a nationwide search...
Frankie Feedler.... despite the fact that no airline will claim...
You remember him?
From high school.
The F. A. A. remained tight- lipped on the details of the current situation.
He died.
The engine, which appears to have detached...
On his way to the prom.
Remember?
They said he was doomed.
Jesus.
They could have said the same thing about Donnie.
If it fell from a plane, then what happened to the plane?
They don' t know, Samantha.
Mrs. Farmer will bring you home after practice.
- Bye, Mommy!
- Bye, honey.
Donnie, good luck.
Oh, my God!
Okay, tell me everything.
- I' m not allowed to talk about it.
- Oh, my God.
- Hi, Cherita.
- Shut up!
Darko cheats death!
You' re like a celebrity.
I' ve been calling you a jillion times.
- Where you been?
- We stayed at a hotel.
My dad said he saw you at the golf course.
You sleepwalking again, buddy?
I don' t want to talk about it.
And now that you' re famous, you gotta have a smoke.
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Sam?
You' il put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
Goddamn right, I will.
So grotty.
Hey, Cherita, you want a cigarette?
- Chut up!
- Chut up!
Go back to China, bitch!
Just leave her alone.
That' s some good shit, huh?
It' s a fucking cigarette.
I wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace
Against the child in your face
Won' t escape my attention
You keep your distance via the system of touch
And gentle persuasion
With one foot in the past
Nowjust how long will it last?
No, no, no
Have you no ambition?
You keep your distance via the system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I' m lost in admiration
Could I need you this much?
Oh, you' re wasting my time
You' re, just, just, just wasting time
Something happens and I' m head over heels
I never find out
Till I' m head over heels
Something happens, and I' m head over heels
Ah, don' t take my heart, don' t break my heart
Don' t - don' t - don' t throw it away
ln my mind' s eye
One little boy... one little man
Funny how...
Time...
Flies.
"There would be headlines in the papers.
Even the grown- up gangs who ran the betting at the all- in wrestling and the barrow- boys would hear with respect of how Old Misery' s house had been destroyed.
It was as though this plan had been with him all his life, pondered through the seasons, now in his 1 5th year crystallized with the pain of puberty. "
What is Graham Greene trying to communicate with this passage?
Why did the children break into Old Misery' s house?
- Joanie?
- They wanted to rob him.
- you would know that the children...
- You suck.... find a great deal of money in the mattress, but they burn it.
Donnie Darko, perhaps with your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion.
They say it right when they flood the house and they tear it to shreds, that destruction is a form of creation.
So the fact that they burn the money is ironic.
Theyjust want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.
They want to change things.
May we help you?
Yeah, I just registered and they put me in the wrong English class.
You look like you belong here.
Where do I sit?
Sit next to the boy you think is the cutest.
- Quiet!
Let her choose.
Joanie, get up.
The construction guys say it will take about a week to fix the roof.
That damned airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
They still don' t know?
- Know what?
- Where it came from.
No.
Apparently they can' t tell us what happened yet.
Something about... a matching serial number that got burned.
I had to sign a form saying I wouldn' t talk to anyone about it.
So, we' re not supposed to tell anyone
- Yeah.
But, you tell -
What' s your doctor' s name?
- Dr. Thurman, Dad.
- Yes.
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
- Dad?
- What?
Dad!
No mail today.
Maybe tomorrow.
Well?
What did she say to you?
I made a new friend.
Real or imaginary?
Imaginary.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
- Frank.
- Frank.
- What did Frank say?
- He said to follow him.
- Follow him?
Where?
- Into the future.
And then what happens?
And then he said...
Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
Do you think the world is coming to an end?
No.
That' s stupid.
For my entire life, I was a victim of my own fear.
Love.
I was feeding fear through food.
Fear.
And finally, I looked in the mirror.
I looked through the mirror.
In that image,
I saw my ego reflection.
For two years, I thought it was normal for a 10- year- old to wet the bed.
- We tried everything.
- Shh!
Quiet!
But the solution was there all the time.
I' m not afraid anymore!
All over America, people have come together to join hands.
People who believe that human life is absolutely too important, too valuable, and too precious to be controlled by fear.
Hello, my name is Jim Cunningham.
And welcome to "Controlling Fear."
Wake up, Donnie.
"And the prince was led into a world of strange and beautiful magic."
Hey, you guys, guess what?!
I can' t believe this!
- because it' s flooded.
- No way.
- Yeah.
- Holy shit!
That' s the best news I' ve ever heard!
My God, is this ever going to stop?
Eventually, yes it will.
But right now I got 12 classrooms full of water, all coming from a busted water main.
- What else?
- What else?!
Principal Cole, I' il show you what else.
That' s unbelievable.
That' s solid bronze, isn' t it?
- Yep.
- How did this happen?
Beth' s mom said the boys' locker room was flooded and they found feces everywhere.
- What are feces?
- Baby mice.
Aw- ww...
Hey...
Has anyone ever told you that you' re sexy?
I like your boobs.
Hey.
Hey.
School was cancelled.
Do you want to walk me home?
Sure.
- Don' t look so freaked.
- I' m not.
You should check your backpack, those guys love to steal shit.
So, why did you move here?
My parents got a divorce.
My mom had to get a restraining order against my stepdad.
- He has emotional problems.
- I have those, too.
What kind of emotional problems does your dad have?
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
Oh.
Did he go tojail?
No, he fled.
They still can' t find him.
But my mom and I had to change our names.
And I thought "Gretchen Ross" was really cool.
I was in jail once.
I mean...
I accidentally burned down this house.
I got held back in school and I can' t drive until I' m 21.
But I' m over all of that.
I' m painting and stuff.
Writing.
I want to be a writer or maybe a painter, or maybe both.
I' il write a book and draw the pictures.
Then maybe people will understand me.
I don' t know, change things.
"Donnie Darko"?
What the hell kind of name is that?
It' s like some sort of superhero or something.
What makes you think I' m not?
I should go.
For physics, Monnitoff is having me write this essay...
"Greatest invention ever to benefit mankind."
It' s Monnitoff.
But that' s easy.
Antiseptics.
The whole sanitation thing.
Joseph Lister, 1 895.
Before antiseptics, there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
You mean, soap?
Well, I' m really glad school was flooded today.
Why is that?
Because you and I would have never had this conversation.
You' re weird.
Sorry.
No, that was a compliment.
Well, look... you want to go with me?
Where do you want to go?
No, I mean, like, "go" with me.
It' s what we call it here.
- "Going together."
- Sure.
Okay.
Where are you going?
I' m going home.
So stupid!
"Where are you going?"
I' d like to try something new this time.
Have you ever been hypnotized?
No.
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up.
Do you understand?
Yes.
So... tell me about your week.
I met a girl.
What is her name?
Gretchen.
We' re going together now.
Do you still think about girls a lot?
Yeah.
How are things going at school?
I think about girls a lot.
I asked you about school, Donnie.
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
What else do you think about during school?
"Married With Children."
Do you think about your family?
I just turn down the volume and think about fucking Christina Applegate.
I asked you about your family, Donnie.
No.
I don' t think about fucking my family.
That' s gross.
I' d like to hear about your friend, Frank.
Sam Bylen?
Ahem.
Donald Darko.
Daye Dennis.
Hey, you fuck!
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
I didn' t say shit.
That' s not what I heard.
They think I did it.
Yeah, well, if you' re innocent, then you have nothing to worry about, right?
Fuck you!
You know what I think?
I think you did it.
Beer and pussy, that' s all I need.
We gotta find ourselves a Smurfette.
Smurfette?
Mm- hmm.
Not some, like, tight- ass, Middlesex chick, you know?
Like this cute little blonde, that will get down and dirty with the guys.
- Like Smurfette does.
- Smurfette doesn' t fuck.
That' s bullshit.
Smurfette fucks all the other Smurfs.
Why do you think Papa Smurf made her?
Because all the other Smurfs were getting too horny.
No, no, no, not "Vanity."
I heard he was a homosexual.
Okay, well, you know what?
Then, she fucks them while Vanity watches.
Okay?
What about Papa Smurf?
He must get in on the action.
Yeah, what he does, he films the gang- bang.
Later on, he beats off to the tape.
First of all,
Papa Smurf didn' t create Smurfette.
Gargamel did.
She was sent in as Gargamel' s evil spy with the intention of destroying the Smurf village.
But the overwhelming goodness of the Smurf way of life transformed her.
And as for the whole gang- bang scenario, itjust couldn' t happen.
Smurfs are asexual.
They don' t even have... reproductive organs under those little white pants.
That' s what' s so illogical, you know, about being a Smurf.
What' s the point of living... if you don' t have a dick?
Damn it, Donnie.
Why do you gotta get so smart on us?
- Grandma Death.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Please stay off the road, Miss Sparrow.
I am going to call Social Services.
I hate that Mrs. Farmer.
That' s it.
- She' s such a fucking bitch.
- There you are, that' s a girl.
- Yeah.
- How old is Grandma Death?
- 101.
She does the same thing every day.
Just walks back and forth and back and forth to the mailbox.
Nothing ever in there.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
She goes - she' s going back to the box.
We may still have mail.
- Mail, mail, mail.
- Here it is.
- And...?
- This could be it.
Oh- hhh!
No dice, Grandma.
No, sorry.
Sorry.
Someone ought to write that bitch.
Authorities continued their search today for a suspect in the Middlesex Ridge School vandalism.
In other news -
ln cooperation with the county police, we have begun an active investigation into the cause of the flooding.
And our suspects include several of our own students -
Mrs. I want to know why this filth is being taught to our children.
That' s what I want to know.
Kitty, I would appreciate -
Let her speak, for God' s sake!
- If you would wait - - Dr. Cole, not only am I a teacher, but I am also a parent of a Middlesex child.
Therefore I am the only person here who transcends the parent- teacher bridge.
Don' t worry.
You got away with it.
I have in my hand
Graham Greene' s "The Destructors."
This short story is part of my daughter' s English assignment.
We' re with you, Kitty!
In this story, several children destroy an elderly man' s house from inside out.
How can you do that?
And how do they do this?
They flood the house by breaking through a water main.
I can do anything I want.
And so can you.
We pay good money for this school.
- It' s our children!
And I think that this garbage should be removed.
Excuse me.
What is the real issue here?
The P. T. A. doesn' t ban books.
The P. T. A. is here to acknowledge that pornography is being taught in our curriculum!
It' s meant to be ironic.
Excuse me.
You need to go back to grad school.
Why did you make me flood the school?
They are in great danger.
- We have rights here!
- Kitty... do you even know who Graham Greene is?
I think we have all seen "Bonanza."
Well...
- Good work, Kitty. - while we are on other topics...
Where did you come from?
Do you believe in time travel?
Who are you talking to?
I was just taking my pills, Sam.
It is time to breathe.
Thank you, Jim Cunningham.
Thank you, Jim Cunningham.
So now let us begin Life Line Exercise Number One.
Please press "Stop" now.
Mrs. As you can see, the Life Line is divided into two polar extremes.
Fear and love.
Fear is in the negative energy spectrum.
And love is in the positive energy spectrum.
No duh.
Excuse me?
"No duh..." is a product offear.
Now, on each card is a character dilemma which applies to the Life Line.
Please - take this!
Thank you.
Please read each character dilemma aloud, and place an "X" on the Life Line in the appropriate place.

She takes the wallet to the address on the driver' s license but keeps the money inside the wallet. "
I- I' m sorry, Mrs. Farmer.
I don' t get this.
Just place an "X" on the Life Line in the appropriate place.
No.
I know what to do.
I just - I don' t get this.
You can' t lump things into two categories.
Things aren' t that simple.
The Life Line is divided that way.
Life isn' t that simple.
I mean, who cares if Ling Ling returns the wallet and keeps the money?
It has nothing to do with either fear or love.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
Okay.
But you' re not listening to me.
There are other things that need to be taken into account.
Like the whole spectrum of human emotion.
You can' tjust lump everything into these two categories and then just deny everything else.
If you don' t complete the assignment, you' il get a zero for the day.
Iet me preface this by saying that your lowa Test scores are... intimidating.
Iet' s go over this again.
What exactly did you say to Mrs. Farmer?
Mrs. I' il tell you what he said.
He asked me to forcibly insert the Life Line exercise card into my anus!
These are modern times.
My political attitudes are forthright.
And if there' s a Vice- Presidential candidate worthy of my vote, it has to be Dan Quayle.
Mrs. Nobody cares about responsibility, morality, family values.
Mm- hmm.
Kitty...
Excuse us, please.
They' ve suspended him from afterschool activities for the next six months.
I honestly don' t know what' s gotten into him -
Rose, I' il tell you this because our daughters have been on the dance team together for two years, and I respect you as a woman.
I have significant doubts about your -
Our paths through life must be righteous.
I urge you to go home and look in the mirror, and pray that your son doesn' t succumb to the path offear.
Wait.
Do you remember that weird gym teacher, Mrs. Farmer?
Yeah.
Okay, well, my brother told her to shove a book up her ass today.
And then my parents just bought him all this new shit.
Yeah, I know.
I wish a jet engine would fall in my room.
I can show you the way.
- Dr. Monnitoff?
- Donnie.
I know this is gonna sound kind of weird, but... do you know anything about... time travel?
Dr. Ah, a wormhole with an Einstein- Rosen bridge, which is... theoretically, a wormhole in space controlled by man.
So, according to Hawking, a wormhole may be able to provide a shortcut forjumping between two distant regions of space- time.
In order to travel back in time, you have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light?
- Theoretically.
- And be able to find one of these wormholes?
The basic principles of time travel are there.
You' ve got your vessel and your portal, and your vessel could be just about anything,
- most likely a spacecraft.
- Like a DeLorean?
Metal craft of any kind.
Iike futuristic, you know?
Listen...
Don' t tell anybody that I gave you this.
The woman who wrote this used to teach here.
She was a nun many years before that, but... then overnight, she just - she became this entirely different person.
She up and left the church, she wrote this book.
She started teaching science, right here in Middlesex.
"The Philosophy of Time Travel."
Roberta Sparrow?
That' s right.
Come on.
Roberta Sparrow?
Roberta Sparrow.
"Grandma Death."
It' s called "The Philosophy of Time Travel."
What does philosophy have to do with time travel?
- Let me see.
- Guess who wrote it.
Who?
Roberta Sparrow?!
She wrote a book.
"Grandma Death" wrote a book.
That' s a terrible nickname.
We almost hit her with the car the other day.
She' s -
Yeah, you' re right.
She used to be known for her gem collection.
Kids... used to go up there all the time and try to steal stuff from her.
She became a total recluse.
Huh - I didn' t even know she was alive till we damn near knocked her down the other day.
She was just standing there in the middle of the road, frozen.
So I got out of the car and I walked over to her to see if she was okay.
And she leaned over and whispered in my ear.
What did she say?
I think Frank wants me to go talk to her, because the last time I saw him, he asked me if I knew about time travel.
She wrote a book about it, so that can' t be a coincidence, right?
Donnie, what did Roberta Sparrow say to you?
She said that every living creature on Earth dies alone.
How did that make you feel?
It reminded me of my dog, Callie.
She died when I was eight, and she crawled underneath... the porch.
To die?
To be alone.
Do you feel alone right now?
I don' t know.
I just don' t debate it anymore, you know?
So I just -
I just don' t debate it any more.
It' s absurd.
The search for God is absurd?
It is if everyone dies alone.
Does that scare you?
I don' t want to be alone.
I have been a prisoner of my own fear.
Fear?
Rose, you have got to meet this Jim Cunningham.
I can' t believe he' s single.
And it has been a disappointing night indeed for these Super Bowl champions.
You' re right, Dan.
Coach Joe Gibbs is on the sidelines, water dripping off his glasses, but he' s gotta be thinking,
"What happened?
What went wrong tonight? "
And here' s the kick...
And it' s no good.
- Shit, we need a quarterback.
- And a miracle.
We need to go for a safety.
Mark Rypien has some big shoes to fill, that' s for certain.
He sure does.
So what the future holds for this Super Bowl M. V. P. we' re just gonna have to wait and see.
- You guys want anything?
- No.
Darrell Green again with a display of amazing speed...
I' m gonna get a beer.
... deep into the end zone.
It' s gonna be brought out to the 20- yard line.
First down and 10.
Good evening, ladies and ghouls.
Join us at the Middlesex Pavilion Mall for the Middlesex Halloween Haunt...
And what if you could go back in time and take all those hours of pain and darkness and replace them with something better?
Like images, or what?
Yeah, like a Hawaiian sunset or the Grand Canyon.
Things that remind you of how beautiful the world -
We' ve been going together for like, two weeks.
Yeah?
Well, I...
Do you want to kiss me?
- I - I' m sorry.
- Look, Donnie, wait.
- I like you a lot.
- I just want it to be... at a time when it...
When what?
When it reminds me- just...
When it reminds you how beautiful the world can be?
Yeah.
And right now there' s some fat guy over there staring at us.
Thank you for seeing us at such late notice.
We both felt that it was time for us to come in and discuss...
What I think is going on with your son?
Yes.
Well, he' s -
You know about his past, and he was suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
I' m not really sure that' s a good example.
I think he had just cause to insult her.
Rose, let me just lay out what I believe is happening here.
Dr. Donnie' s aggressive behavior... his increased detachment from reality, seem to stem from his inability to cope with the forces in the world he perceives to be threatening.
Has he ever told you about his friend Frank?
Frank?
Yes, the giant bunny rabbit.
The what?
I don' t recall... him ever having mentioned a rabbit.
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
This is a common occurrence among paranoid schizophrenics.
What can we do?
I would like to... do more hypnotherapy, and increase his medication.
Whatever will help him, really, because that' s why we' re here.
We just would like him to experience some... relief.
So if you think that more medication will do that, then I think we should give it a try.
Donnie Darko.
I know.
Good morning, you mongrels!
Good morning.
Is that all the gusto you can muster?
I said, "Good morning!"
Good morning!
Now that' s a tiny, tiny bit better.
But I can still sense some students out there who are actually afraid to say, "Good morning!"
- Good morning!
- Yeah, that' s what I like to hear!
Because entirely too many young men and women today are completely paralyzed by their fears.
They surrender their bodies to the temptation and destruction of drugs, alcohol, and premarital sex.
Now, I' m going to tell you a little story today.
It' s a heartbreakingly sad story about a young man whose life was completely destroyed by these instruments offear.
A young man, searching for love in all the wrong places.
His name was Frank.
Iike, I sometimes worry that she eats too much.
- Shut up, Kim!
- Sweetheart, please.
How can I decide what I want to be when I grow up?
That' s a hard one.
What do I do to learn how to fight?
"What do I do to learn how to fight?"
Son, violence is a product offear.
Learn to truly love yourself.
- Okay.
- Okay, get yourself up here.
- Okay.
- All right.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Um...
How much are they paying you to be here?
Uh... excuse me?
What is your name, son?
Gerald.
I think you' re afraid.
Are you telling us this stuff so we can buy your book?
Because I got to tell you, if you are, that was some of the worst advice I ever heard.
Do you see how sad this is?
Do you want your sister to lose weight?
Tell her to get off the couch, stop eating Twinkies, and maybe go out for field hockey.
You know what?
No one ever knows what they want to be when they grow up.
It takes a little while to find that out.
Right, Jim?
And you...
Yeah, you.
Sick of some jerk shoving your head down the toilet?
Maybe you should lift some weights or take a karate lesson.
And the next time he tries to do it, you kick him in the balls.
Son.
Do you see this?
- This is an anger prisoner,
- Remove him.
- A textbook example.
Do you see the fear, people?
This boy is scared to death of the truth.
Son, it breaks my heart to say this, but I believe you are a very troubled and confused young man.
I believe you are searching for the answers in all the wrong places.
You' re right, actually.
I am pretty - I' m pretty troubled and I' m pretty confused, but l - and I' m afraid, really, really afraid.
Really afraid.
I think you' re the fucking Antichrist.
Get him out of here!
Who do you think you are?
It' s amazing.
The man thinks he' s telling the truth, and everything he says is just a fucking lie!
Everything he says!
Everyone thinks he' s so rad.
He' s such a fucking chud.
- Everything he does - - Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- Sit down.
Calm down.
You ever hear of Grandma Death?
Who?
"The Philosophy of Time Travel."
What is this?
She wrote it.
I' m -
I' ve been seeing stuff.
Like, a lot of really messed up stuff.
And there are chapters in that book that describe the stuff I' ve been seeing.
It can' tjust be a coincidence.
Dr. Each vessel travels along a vector... through space- time, along its center of gravity.
Like a spear.
I beg your pardon?
Like a spear that comes out of your chest.
Umm... sure.
And in order for the vessel to travel through time, it' s got to find a portal, or in this case a wormhole -
Could these portals -
Could these portals just appear anywhere, anytime?
I think that' s highly unlikely.
No, I think what you' re talking about is... an act of God.
If God controls time, then all time is pre- decided.
I' m not following you.
Every living thing follows along a set path.
And if you could see your path or channel, then you could see into the future, right?
Like... that' s a form of time travel.
Well, you' re contradicting yourself.
If we were able to see our destinies manifest themselves visually, then we would be given a choice to betray our chosen destinies.
And the mere fact that this choice exists, would make all pre- formed destiny come to an end.
Not if you travel within God' s channel.
Um...
I' m not going to be able to continue this conversation.
- Why?
- I could lose myjob.
Okay.
Now you know where he lives.
Dr. And they grow out of our chest... solar plexus?
Just like she described in the book, the way they moved and they smelled.
It' s like - Iike they' re workers.
Assigned to each one of us.
Theyjust - they' re like liquid.
I followed it... into my parents' bedroom.
What did you find?
Nothing.
So we call them IMGs.
lnfant Memory Generators.
The idea is that you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
But inside the glasses are these slide photographs.
And each photograph is of something peaceful or beautiful... whatever the parents want to put inside.
And what effect do you think this would have on an infant?
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy.
Anyone who says they do is lying.
So we think this will help develop memory earlier in life.
Yeah.
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness?
That maybe darkness is part of their natural development?
- No.
- Mm- mm.
Yeah.
What if the parents put in pictures of Satan?
Or, like, dead people?
Crap like that.
Is that what you' d show your kids?
Well, I mean... didn' t your dad, like, stab your mom?
Get out.
Gretchen!
I' m sorry, Gretchen.
Gretchen, I' m sorry about those guys.
Two for "Evil Dead," please.
That' il be $2.
Why do you wear that stupid bunny suit?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Take it off.
What happened to your eye?
I' m so sorry.
Why do they call you Frank?
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
Frank?
When' s this going to stop?
You should already know that.
I want you to watch the movie screen.
There' s something I want to show you.
Have you ever seen a portal?
Burn it to the ground.
I want you to concentrate.
Failure is not an option.
- just swallow it.
- Okay, Mom.
Hey, you guys, good luck out there.
Get off the stage, Cherita!
You suck!
Now that was really something.
Thank you, Cherita Chen, with "Autumn Angel."
And now the moment we' ve all been waiting for is here.
It is my very distinct pleasure to introduce to you...
Emily Bates, Suzy Bailey,
Samantha Darko, Beth Farmer, and Joanie James.
They are...
"Sparkle Motion."
No - no - notorious...
Notorious
No - no - notorious
I can' t read about it
Burns the skin from your eyes
I' il do fine without it
Here' s one you don' t compromise
Lies come hard in disguise
They need to fight it out, not wild about it
Lay your seedyjudgments
Who says they' re part of our lives?
You own the money
You control the witness
I' il leave you lonely
Don' t monkey with my business
You pay the prophets
Tojustify your reasons
I heard your promise, but I don' t believe it
That' s why I' ve done it again...
All right, Sparkle Motion!
How long was I asleep for?
Whole movie.
Iooks like we' ve got another room back here.
The blaze was extinguished sometime after 8: 00 last night.
Firefighters discovered what has been referred to as a "kiddie porn dungeon."
- was arrested early this morning...
- Oh, my God!... at Sarasota Heights Country Club.
Arson has not been ruled out as part of the cause of the fire.
A group of Cunning Vision employees...
Oh, my God.
Dad played golf with that guy.... vehemently denied the alleged link to a child pornography publishing circuit.
Cunningham attacked the Middlesex Fire Department officials, claiming a vast conspiracy.
I' m sorry, Karen, but we don' t think the methods you' ve undertaken here are appropriate.
With all due respect, sir, what exactly about my methods do you find inappropriate?
I don' t have time to get into a debate about this.
I believe I' ve made myself clear.
You call this clarity?
I don' t think that you have a clue what it' s like to communicate with these kids.
And we are losing them to apathy... to this prescribed nonsense.
They are slipping away.
I am sorry that you have failed.
Now if you' il excuse me, I have another appointment.
You can finish out the week.
Fuck!
Good afternoon.
It gives me great pleasure to announce that the Middlesex Ridge School dance team has been invited to perform on Ed McMahon' s "Star Search '88" in Los Angeles, California.
No, it was ridiculous.
I' il call you back.
- Rose.
- Kitty.
I' m sure you' re aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
I know, I saw it on TV.
Something about a...
"kiddie porn dungeon."
Please, please.
Don' t use those words!
It' s obviously some kind of conspiracy to destroy an innocent man.
I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defense campaign.
Rose...
I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning.
As you know, the girls are scheduled to leave for Los Angeles in the morning.
As their coach, I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on their trip -
- Yes.
- Hmm.
I would never dream of asking you.
But none of the other mothers are available to go.
I don' t know, Kitty.
It' s a bad weekend.
Eddie' s in New York.
Rose!
I don' t know if you realize what an opportunity this is for our daughters!
This has been a dream of Samantha' s and all of ours for a long time.
I made her lead dancer!
Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
Elizabeth will be in charge.
She' il drive you to therapy.
If you need anything, you promise me that you will call Dr. Thurman?
How' s it feel to have a wacko for a son?
It feels wonderful.
So what do I tell the other kids when they ask about you?
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.
What' s "Cellar Door"?
This famous linguist once said, that of all the phrases in the English language... of all the endless combinations... of words in all of history, that "cellar door" is the most beautiful.
"Cellar door"?
I promise that one day everything' s going to be better for you.
Chut up!
Dr. I want to talk about your past today.
No.
Dr. I want to talk about... you and your parents.
They didn' t buy me
They didn' t buy me what I wanted for Christmas.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
"Hungry, Hungry Hippos."
How did you feel, being denied these "Hungry, Hungry Hippos"?
Regret.
What else makes you feel regret?
That I did it again.
You did it again?
I flooded my school and I burned down that pervert' s house.
I only have a few days left before they catch me.
Did Frank tell you to do these things?
I have to obey him.
He saved my life.
I have to obey him or I' il be left all alone.
And then - and then I won' t be able to figure out what this is all about.
I won' t be able to know his master plan.
Do you mean, God' s master plan?
Do you now believe in God?
I have the power to build a time machine.
How is that possible?
How is time travel possible?
Donnie?
Time' s up, Frank said.
When is this going to happen?
Soon.
Soon.
What is going to happen?
Frank is going to kill.
Who is he going to kill?
Who is he going to kill, Donnie?
I can see him right now!
The sky is going to open up.
If the sky were to suddenly open up, there would be no law.
There would be no rule.
There would only be you and your memories - the choices you' ve made, and the people you' ve touched.
If this world were to end, there would only be you... and him... and no one else.
Hey.
I got in.
I' m going to Harvard.
We should totally throw a party.
I mean, Mom and Dad are gone.
It' s Halloween Carnival.
We could get away with it.
Okay, but it has to be small, all right?
- What do you guys got?
- Nothing good.
Happy Halloween!
We got eggs, water balloons and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
I stole four beers from my dad.
- Well, we got a keg.
- Keg beer is for pussies.
Rose, this is Lilian Thurman.
It is extremely important that you call me as soon as you get this message.
Thank you.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Are you okay?
Yeah, my mom' s gone.
You want to come in?
Yeah.
I don' t know, she... she didn' t leave a note and the house was all messed up.
But you' re okay?
Did you call the cops?
Yeah, they said I should leave the house and that I should go to a safe place.
I' m just so scared.
I keep thinking something awful is happening, and... it' s my fucking stepdad, I know it.
I guess some people are just born with tragedy in their blood.
Hey, have you guys seen Frank?
No, I think they were going on a beer run.
- Shit.
lf you' re there, please pick up.
Oh, well.
Good news.
The girls, they got three and a half stars, and they get to come back for the quarterfinals.
It was amazing.
Anyway... we' re going to take the red- eye back tonight, and we ought to arrive -
Mom - the plane' s about to leave.
Okay, okay.
We' il take the red- eye back tonight.
We should arrive around 8: 30 in the morning.
I hope everything' s all right.
I love you.
Bye.... no private consultation
Under the Milky Way tonight
Wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find
And it' s something quite peculiar
Something shimmering and white
It leads you here
Despite your destination
Under the Milky Way tonight
Wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find
Wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would find
"... the cellar door..."
And it' s something quite peculiar...
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?
- Donnie.
- Look, we gotta go.
- Where?
- You ever see Grandma Death?
Why, is this about the book?
- No, it' s Frank.
- Donnie -
Time is running out!
We gotta go.
Roberta Sparrow.
Grandma Death.
Donnie, nobody' s here.
Let' s just forget about it.
Huh - "Cellar door."
What?
Oh, my God!
Donnie!
Donnie!
Donnie -!
Why the fuck are you here?!
Oh, my God!
You' re dead!
What are we doing?
- Shit!
- Leave him alone!
Don' t fucking move!
Don' t fucking move!
Fuck!
- There' s a car.
Get the hell out of here.
Now!
Seth, there' s a car coming.
Let' s go!
I have a bigger knife now.
Let' s go!
He called the cops!
Did you call the fucking cops?!
- Deus ex machina.
- What did you just say?
- What the fuck did you just say?
- Our savior.
Donnie!
Gretchen...?
Gretchen...?
Gretchen.
Wake up, Gretchen.
- Frank...
- Wake up.
What did you do?
Gretchen, wake up.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Gretchen...
Gretchen...
What the fuck did you do, man?
You killed her, Frank!
Is she dead?
What were you guys doing in the middle of the road?!
What are you thinking?!
Go home.
Go home and tell your parents everything will be okay.
Go!
28 days...
Six hours... 42 minutes... 12 seconds.
I' m going home.
- Dr. Theoretically.
And be able to find one of these wormholes?
Dr. The basic principles of time travel are there.
You' ve got your vessel and your portal.
And your vessel could be just about anything, most likely a spacecraft.
Metal craft of any kind.
What if you could go back in time and take those hours of pain and darkness and replace them with something better?
"Dear Roberta Sparrow,
I' ve reached you in your book, but there' s so many things I need to ask you.
Sometimes I' m afraid of what you might tell me.
Sometimes I' m afraid that you' il tell me this is not a work offiction.
I can only hope that the answers will come to me in my sleep.
I can breathe a sigh of relief, because there will be so much to look forward to. "
All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places
Worn out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression
No expression
Hide my head, I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow
No tomorrow
And I find it kind offunny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I' m dying
Are the best I' ve ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It' s a very, very...
Mad world
Mad world
Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen
Sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me
No one knew me
Hello, teacher, tell me, what' s my lesson?
Look right through me
Look right through me
And I find it kind offunny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I' m dying
Are the best I' ve ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It' s a very, very...
Mad world
Mad world
Enlarged in your world
Mad world.
Hey... what' s going on?
Horrible accident.
My neighbor... got killed.
What happened?
Got smooshed by a jet engine.
What was his name?
Donnie.
Donnie Darko.
I feel bad for his family.
Yeah.
Did you know him?
No.
... switch back to base.
All units should be back on base frequency.
I wrote it all down:
4, 222 square feet, four floors. perfect.
Courtyard in back, south- facing garden.
Perfect.
- Shouldn' t we wait for the car service?
- No, we' il sit in traffic forever.
- Is that the listing sheet?
- There isn' t one.
I heard about it this morning.
It' il be gone soon.
- None.
You know the market is tight.
- Sarah, do you have to ride that here?
- Mom, we' re in the street.
Evan!
One day you will learn to respect people' s time, Lydia.
You' il realize that the world does not stop and start at your convenience.
I' m so sorry.
I' m meeting Arthur Digby Laurence in 26 minutes...... and if you think he' s the kind of man who tolerates tardiness...... you are sadly mistaken.
You' re a saint to wait for us.
- Hello.
It' s kind of between a townhouse and a brownstone.
We call it a "townstone".
Built in 1879, this is the middle of the house, the parlor floor.
Formal dining is in the back.
Casual dining below on the kitchen floor...... which was renovated in '94 with all the expected amenities.
Sarah.
There are two bedroom floors above.
My God, it' s amazing.
Hey, kid.
No scooter.
I don' t have to tell you this amount of living space is uncommon in Manhattan.
It' s got a yard.
Sort of.
It is in a bit of disarray, but then again, 21- foot lot, 53 deep.
It allows for an expansive garden.
Working elevator.
The previous owner was disabled the last years of his life.
Highly unusual, the elevator.
You will not find this in 90 percent of brownstones.
It' s a very emotional property.
Shall we have a look at the rest?
You should make an offer immediately.
Can I see it first?
There is nothing like this on the market right now.
You can' t move from Greenwich to the Upper West Side...... and expect to still have a house, a yard and a dog and cat, but here it is.
It' s got everything you told me you wanted and more.
You' il have another family.
You could have two.
It' s a fortune.
Mom, it' s not Barneys.
You don' t have to pay the price on the tag.
He can afford it.
It would be so lovely if I could show the property before I leave.
Hardwood floors throughout, as many as six working fireplaces.
This is the top floor.
Two bedrooms.
One at either end.
They share one small bath.
Originally, this would have been the servants' quarters.
The previous owner kept a small nursing staff.
I don' t know if you have live- in help.
No, it' s just the two of us.
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, or what have you.
Mr. Pearlstine used this as an office.
He' s talking about Sidney Pearlstine, the financier.
May I ask what you do, Mrs....
Altman.
Actually, I' m going back to school.
Columbia.
Her husband' s in pharmaceuticals.
I didn' t realize you were Stephan Altman' s wife.
Yes, until recently.
Master bath.
Pearlstine' s been in all the papers since he died.
He was a recluse.
Rich, paranoid.
Now they can' t find half his money.
I hardly see how gossip is germane to showing the property.
It sounds ridiculous.
Walk- in closet.
Could the little one please stop that?
Kid, no elevator!
And we emerge in the master suite.
That' s strange.
What?
Is this room smaller than it should be?
You' re the first person to notice.
On caravan, no one from our office had the slightest idea.
It' s called a panic room.
- What?
- A safe room.
- A castle keep in medieval times.
- I' ve read about these.
They' re in vogue in high- end construction.
One can' t be too careful about home invasion.
This is perfect.
The alarm goes off in the middle of the night.
What will you do?
Call the police and wait till Tuesday?
I think not.
Concrete walls.
Buried phone line, not connected to the house' s main line.
Call the police, nobody can cut you off.
You have your own ventilation system.
A bank of surveillance monitors that covers nearly every corner of the house.
This whole thing makes me nervous.
Why?
Ever read any Poe?
No, but I loved her last album.
Steel.
Thick steel.
Very thick steel.
Full battery backup, so even if the power' s out...... it' s still functional.
Oh, my god.
Old Sidney didn' t miss a trick, did he?
Open it, please.
And with kids like he' s apparently got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide.
Please open the door.
That is highly inappropriate.
Open the door, please.
Definitely my room.
This is really dangerous.
- That door is a hazard.
- Not at all.
Motion detector, like an elevator.
The door won' t close if it' s blocked.
There' s another one at your ankles.
It couldn' t be safer.
I know they' il take asking price.
It' s working.
I hooked up the phone!
Good for you, Mom.
Hooked up a phone.
579 what?
3000.
patsy' s pizza. please hold.
Hey.
Enough.
Mind the pizza?
What do you mean?
Our first night.
I should' ve thought of something special.
I like pizza.
Fuck him.
Don' t.
Fuck her, too.
I agree.
But don' t.
Don' t you think this place has way too many stairs?
You didn' t carry anything up them.
You never asked what I thought of this house.
I didn' t want you to tell me you hated it.
- Well, so did l.
You know what I was thinking?
I was thinking we could stencil the whole bookcase.
We could cut the stencils, do it ourselves.
Go ahead.
Oh, damn.
I forgot to set up that tour of your new school.
Dad already did it.
I' m going with him on Sunday.
Oh, yeah?
So I' il take a cab and meet him there.
Is that what he said?
Isn' t that what' s so great about Manhattan?
You don' t have to drive me everywhere?
I' il ride with you.
Why' d you bring me here if I can' t go anywhere on my own?
That' s it.
I quit.
I' m not fighting with you till tomorrow.
Come here.
It' s disgusting how much I love you.
Tell me about it.
- Mom?
- Yeah.
It' s too dark.
Better?
That' s better.
"Bypass non- ready zone".
"Bypass non- ready zone".
"Shunt.
Enter ".
"Bypass non- ready zone".
"Shunt".
"Enter zone number".
"Shunt again".
In the morning I got to figure out how to turn this thing off.
Go, go back.
Do it.
Come on.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Amateur.
We got a problem!
We need to talk!
It' s about time.
I' m freezing my tits off out there.
- Who is that?
- This is Raoul.
Who the fuck is Raoul?
Raoul is okay.
- Where' d you get him?
- Through some people.
Open the fucking door.
No shit.
What is this?
They' re asleep.
They' re not supposed to be here.
- This is your department, Junior!
Videotape.
We' re on videotape.
We' ve been on videotape since we got here and the tapes are upstairs.
- You fucked me!
14- day escrow!
That' s almost 3 weeks!
They should not be in for another week!
Exactly how is 14 days three weeks?
Business days.
Escrow is always business days.
Five- day weeks always!
Right?
I' m out of here.
Just wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
We can handle this.
Can we still handle this?
It' s just a woman and a kid?
- Unless Daddy comes home.
- He' s not.
They' re divorcing.
Daddy' s banging some B model on the Upper East Side.
It' s just her and the kid!
Now, can we do this?
Yeah, we can do it.
And not with me.
Twenty minutes!
- She' il call the police.
They' il be here before I unpack my bags.
So, we keep an eye on her.
Raoul can totally administrate that part.
He' s not even supposed to be here!
Nobody gets hurt.
What about us?
What if she has a gun?
Who are you?
I' m Raoul.
You know we can' t do this without you!
Fuck that!
This is a great plan.
It' s just got a slight twist.
Felony kidnapping.
Thirty years.
You make a lot of promises, don' t you?
You promise me, you promise your kids.
No family.
You' re right.
I fucked it up!
It' s not how it' s supposed to be.
But the fact of the matter is there' s still $3, 000, 000 in this house...... and no one but you and I even knows it' s here.
I want it!
But you...... you need that money.
Or have you forgotten why you' re here?
So let' s quit dicking around, okay, and get this over with.
Kill the phones.
I' ve got the mother.
Give me that!
You stay here!
Nobody gets past!
Sarah!
Get up!
What did you do that for?
Where are you going?
- People.
In the house.
They' re in the elevator, heading down.
They' re coming down to you!
I told you.
I don' t hurt people.
They' re going downstairs.
- That room.
- What?
The panic room.
No, press emergency stop.
Fuck!
Coming back up!
That' s you.
Shit.
Go!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Mother -
Shit!
That' s seven years bad luck.
Shit.
Tell me they' re not in there.
Oh, damn.
- It doesn' t work?
- It' s a different phone line.
I never hooked it up.
Now what?
I can' t hear a thing.
I don' t know.
Rob us....
I don' t know.
What do we do?
We wait.
- Well, they can' t.
It' s not possible.
Mom.
I heard you.
- Yeah.
- You shaky?
- No.
- No.
Don' t worry about me.
He' s got kids.
What do you think he' il do?
Hang out while the cops waltz in?
Use your head.
I locked the roof access.
She' s not getting down from there.
- Good.
- She could be in there calling the cops.
No.
You don' t just call up Bell Atlantic.
She would' ve had to do it through Manhattan Security, my company.
You see?
She couldn' t have.
- I thought she wouldn' t be here.
Fuck you!
And fuck you!
She is not supposed -
Do it.
Excuse me.
The police are on their way.
- You' re full of -
It' s not an intercom.
It' s a PA system.
I know.
I' m just scaring her.
I suggest you leave before they get here.
- He' s saying that we don' t have a phone.
How could he know that?
Take what you want and get outI
If only it were that easy.
I need some paper.
Give me some paper.
Hey, Zorro!
You going to help us out?
You got a piece of paper?
- What is he doing?
- I don' t know.
"What we want is in that room"?
No, no.
I told you.
They can' t get in here.
What do you know about this room?
What do we know about that room?
- Let' s not tell her anything.
- Just a few details.
We' re not coming out, and we' re not letting you in!
Get out of my houseI
- You fuck.
- What?
"Get the fuck out of my house".
Get the fuck out of my houseI
Okay, I have an idea.
She' s a woman.
Women need security.
She won' t believe you.
She needs to know she' s dealing with decent people and she can trust us.
Conversation' s overI
What?
She' s not coming down?
Shut up.
Will you please shut up and let me think?
Like that' il help you think.
You know what?
Fine!
You think!
- She didn' t.
She said it again, that she called the cops.
Okay, fine.
Good, excellent.
We all believe you.
How do we get into that room?
What is funny about this?
Is this shit funny to you?
I spent the last 12 years building these rooms...... to keep out people like us.
It' s all so ironic and amusing, okay?
Now, how do we get in?
We can' t.
You can' t get in the panic room.
That' s the whole point.
We have to get her to come out.
And why would she do that?
I don' t know.
But when she does, she can' t get out of this house.
We keep her here, we keep her quiet for 20 minutes...... and I don' t want any help from Joe Pesci over here.
Fine.
We make it impossible for them to leave.
And why would they come out in the first place?
I' m working on that.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Small space?
I' m okay.
- I know.
- I mean it.
- I won' t.
You know, people never get buried alive anymore.
I guess it used to happen all the time.
Really?
Yeah, I read that.
And when did this happen all the time?
Twenty, thirty years ago.
What are they doing now?
I don' t know.
They' re locking us in.
This is not happening.
Sarah, calm down.
You know what could happen if you let yourself get worked up.
Sarah!
- What the hell are you doing?
- We' re coming in from below.
No, you' re not.
Even if you got through the concrete, there' s steel.
You won' t even make a dent.
We' il see.
Hey.
This is what I do.
If some idiot with a sledgehammer could break in...... do you really think that I would still have a job?
Don' t get that in your eye.
Neighbor.
Help!
Please help us!
- Do you hear us?
Help us!
Help!
- Help us, please!
- Call the police!
Shit!
Why?
What do you got, MacGyver?
He can' t get in here with a hammer, can he?
Could you be any louder?
Give me a hand with those boxes.
Listen, goddamn it!
I' m in charge here.
Now, what the hell is going on?
- They' re going to get in here.
- No, they can' t get in here.
We' re going to be fine.
We' il be just fine.
Oh, this is good.
This could work.
I was just thinking that we should do something like this.
- Open it.
- I just did.
Open it some more.
We' re just sending them a message.
They' il get the point.
Honey, get down on the ground.
Quit dicking around and open this fucking thing up.
- Quiet!
We' re trying to scare them, not kill them.
What is it?
It' s bad.
They' re coughing.
If they' re coughing, they' re going to die!
Nobody is going to die, man!
Will you please have the balls to follow through with something?
Mom.
They' il have a hangover.
How are we going to get in there if they pass out, Junior?
Cut it back a little.
They won' t pass out, numb- nuts.
They' il throw up first.
We can' t get in if they' re dead!
Stay on the ground and breathe.
Turn it down.
Turn it down!
It' s too much!
- Keep it down!
I' m turning it down.
- We' re not killing anybody.
- Tell him to turn it down!
- Turn the shit off.
- Turn it down.
- Just a second.
Get under this.
Oh, my god.
- Fucking amateurs, man!
- It' s my fucking idea.
Shut the fuck up!
There are people trying to sleep over there.
What is that?
Turn the gas off.
Turn the gas off right now.
Get back!
Shit!
God!
Get it off me!
It' s okay.
You fucking bitch!
I' m coming in there!
Calm the fuck down.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Promise me you' il never do anything like that.
I won' t.
They' re moving.
At least they' re still moving in there.
What?
Talk to him.
Please, man, give it a rest.
- That Morse code?
- SOS.
Where' d you learn that?
Titanic.
Downstairs.
No, no, no.
Not you.
Come on, come on, come on.
Get up.
Come on.
Wake up.
The first thing I' m going to do this morning is call my plastic surgeon.
There' s been a change here. $100, 000 is not enough.
Not for this shit.
I want a third of whatever' s in that room up there.
Okay?
Full share, one- third.
Congratulations.
You bought a ski mask, made $1, 000, 000.
Your parents will be proud.
Got him.
Let me straighten out something else.
Get control of your goddamn expert.
Slow down.
Half?
Did you sleep through grade school?
Five seconds ago, it was a third....
Come on.
I' m letting you know he' s a problem.
But this wasn' t my idea, so he' s your problem.
You' re right.
It wasn' t your idea!
None of this was your idea!
It was my idea!
Come on, look over here.
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Let' s hope this guy' s an ex- Boy Scout.
- We' re here!
- Help us!
We' re over here!
Help!
Open your window!
Help!
We' re never going to get out of here.
I' m the loving grandson who put in the time with the old man...... every goddamn weekend for two years...... talking to him, dressing him, walking him, feeding him.
No.
I' m the one the old man finally told about the safe.
I' m the one who found the guy who built it, and I convinced him to break into it!
Wait a minute.
- The bedroom' s empty.
Where are they?
Two of them, on the stairs.
Where' s the third guy?
I left my cell phone by the bed.
I earned that money.
I will not let you jeopardize my fucking plan...... because you have a problem relating to others!
Got it?
If I don' t come back, close this door.
Just do what I say.
He touches me again, I' il shoot him.
Christ!
Wait!
Any other schoolyard bullshit to settle, or can we get back to work?
Don' t take no tone with me, jerk- wad.
I' il shove it up your ass and snap it off.
You' re a bus driver, Raoul.
You live in Flatbush.
Don' t spout some Elmore Leonard bullshit you just heard...... because I saw that movie, too.
What is this?
I got some news for you.
Go.
Go!
Fuck!
What did she get?
No.
Charger!
She has a cell phone.
No!
All right, signal.
Signal.
I don' t think they' il be talking on no cell phone from in there.
- Why not?
- You can' t call out from in there.
No signal.
I didn' t hook up this line, but I hooked up the main line.
If we can find it, we can cut into it.
I' m not built for that shit.
Be careful.
Get the phone.
- Rip it off!
Screwdriver.
Phillips.
Or did you just cut the cord on the phone in the kitchen?
Shit!
Strip this and expose the wires.
- What are we doing?
- I have no idea.
- Okay, got it?
- Yeah.
Here.
Okay.
Yellow, yellow.
Okay.
Dial tone.
911 emergency.
Yes, this is 38 West 94th Street -
God.
Call Dad.
How do you live in New York and not have a single Percocet?
- Stephan.
Put Stephan on the line.
- It' s Meg.
Do you know what time it is?
- Put him on the phone, bitch.
- It' s your fucking wife.
Move.
- Hello?
Move!
There are three men upstairs.
They broke in -
- No, he won' t.
He' il call the police.
You don' t know her.
No.
He knows that there' s trouble.
He heard me.
He' s across the park.
That' s why we got houses close to each other.
He' il help us.
- He won' t.
- Yes, he will!
I' m sorry.
No, I' m sorry.
Why?
I was trying not to tell you.
What?
I' m dizzy and hungry.
All she' s got is NyQuil and fucking Midol.
Looks like that gas idea didn' t work so well.
Whose fault was that?
This is impossible.
What' s the plan now, hot rod?
This is worse than impossible.
This is unpleasant.
Here, drink this.
All right, drink lots of water.
You dropped to the low 40s.
We have to get your blood- sugar up.
Can you hear me okay?
I' m just dizzy, not deaf.
That' s excellent.
Did you see anything in here?
Any candy bars or something sweet?
Let' s check it again.
Mom, I did it.
We got to stay calm, okay?
Stay calm.
You' re making me nervous.
I' m sorry.
What if I keep dropping?
I' il figure something out.
You know, he' s right.
There' s no way we' re getting into that room.
What are you talking about?
I just got to be honest with myself here.
I don' t need to be involved...... with anything so harrowing or perilous at this point in my life.
- You' re giving up?
- Hell, yes.
I don' t need the fucking aggravation.
I' il inherit.
Stephen, Jeffrey, Catherine, David.
Five grandkids, 60 percent inheritance tax.
Fuck, I' il still put away 8 or 900 grand and keep my goddamn hair.
Take it.
Go out and get loaded.
Wait a minute.
Say what you just said again.
Say that shit about the money again, babycakes.
When?
Before?
Yeah, before.
Splitting the money in your head, you said you' d put away 800 or 900 grand.
What are you doing?
That was after tax, which makes it more than a million and a half gross.
So now you' re a tax attorney.
- I' m out of here.
- Wait a minute.
There' s sugar in everything.
Places you' d never expect.
Like ketchup.
Where else?
Travel kit.
Plus, you named eight people you got to split it with...... so that' s 10 or 12 million bucks in the safe.
A fuck- up like you has got to get less than everybody else...... so now I don' t know what to think.
You' re adding up money you' il never touch, buddy.
How much is in there?
Mouthwash.
Saccharin.
Hey, I' m talking to you.
Answer me.
There' s more.
And when were you going to tell us this minor economic detail?
It' s totally fucking moot!
- What were you thinking?
How did you expect to get away with this?
Did you think that I' d open that safe...... and then me and Raoul would wait while you picked out your share?
What' s the matter with you?
You got yourself into this.
You got the custody lawyers up your ass.
Your eyes were huge when I told you about the gig...... so don' t play innocent.
Things didn' t work out.
Play past it.
Mints?
Sugar- free.
I' m opening that safe.
You leave, you get nothing.
It' s looking doubtful there, big guy.
But I don' t ever want to see you again.
Cops show up on my doorstep, we will know who sent them...... and we will fucking find you.
I' il see you, Burnham.
Later, Raoul.
Mom!
Ride in a Town Car to 125th Street a couple of times...... think you know all about it.
You don' t know nothing about me.
Go to the corner.
Okay.
You should see the look on your face.
What' s happening?
- Don' t move.
Don' t you fucking move.
- No, don' t.
Come here.
Come here.
- Don' t shoot, please.
- Come on.
Shut it, lock it and get the fuck away from it.
- Stop it, you fucking - - Fucking what?
Idiot?
Fucking asshole?
Who' s the clown now?
Me.
That' s right.
It' s burning me.
Who' s got the gun?
You.
Remember that.
Find out who the fuck that is.
Give me your wallet.
Give me your wallet.
Stephan Altman.
Did your wife give you a call, Stephan?
What did she say?
Don' t know.
Cut off.
- Did you call anybody else?
Did you call the fucking cops, Stephan?
No.
He' s telling the truth.
Yeah.
Yeah, he probably is.
Because when I do this, people don' t lie.
What?
- What do you want?
- I can' t.
- Yeah, you can.
You just got to squeeze one out.
You want me to just make something up?
You' ve got till the count of three.
Then you end up like Junior over there.
- One, squeeze.
- This is ridiculous.
Two, squeeze.
- Three.
- Wait!
Okay.
I got an idea.
Maybe.
Maybe.
HelpI Rubber Soul...... Yesterday and Today, MagicaI Mystery Tour, The White Album....
Stay warm, baby.
Stay warm, all right?
Let It Be, Revolver, Sgt. pepper....
Oh, god!
Dad?
No, no.
Take it easy.
Open the door!
No.
Don' t open the door!
- Just make it look good.
- Don' t you tell me what -
Open the door!
Don' t open -
Knock it off!
You kill him, they' il never open that door.
Oh, god.
All right.
Lie down.
Lie down.
All right.
You' il be fine.
Come on.
He' s fucking crazy.
Get your hands off him, you frightening hillbilly motherfucker!
You' re a strong girl.
You be strong.
Be strong, sweetheart.
Get the fuck off him, now!
Just get off him!
It' s almost over.
That' s it.
All right, turn around.
I' il be right back.
It' s got blood on it.
Get your tapes.
Who' s this?
It' s her kid.
What happened to her?
Who gives a fuck?
Hurry up.
Get your stuff.
Hey, lady.
Mom?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
We' ve got your kid.
Come down here.
Let' s get this over with.
Get her, get her!
Shit!
No!
Let her out!
- Where' s your gun?
- Open the door.
No!
- I don' t know.
Open up!
Open it.
Listen to me.
She' s got your gun.
She' s got your gun!
Stop it.
I know you' ve got the gun. put the gun down and step away from the door.
You got to open the door.
My daughter is very sick.
She needs an injection.
Do you hear me?
Open the door so I can give her a shot.
Or I swear to God, I' il kill you both.
If I open the door, you' il shoot us.
So give her the shot yourself.
Give her the shotI
Do you need this?
Can you do this yourself?
What happens if you don' t get it?
Coma.
Die.
Open it.
And go all the way downstairs.
And I' il give her the shot, all right?
I told you to leave the gunI
Shit.
You fucking bitchI
If you pull any shit like that again, I will fucking kill her.
Do you hear me?
If you step outside, I' il kill her!
If I see a uniform inside this house, I' il cut her fucking throatI
Do you understand?
Yes.
But please, just give her the shot.
Please.
please.
Don' t fucking do it.
While we' re in here, she' il call the cops.
Are you going to open the safe?
Don' t you look at me.
All I know about this is what I see on TV.
You got to talk me through this.
This right here?
It' s this?
Yeah, okay.
Nice house you guys got.
Your mom' s rich.
Dad' s rich.
Mom' s just mad.
Tap it.
I wish I could have put my kid in a place like this.
It' s not that I didn' t try.
Sometimes things, they don' t work out the way you want them to.
Done.
Wasn' t supposed to be like this.
He had it all worked out.
Nobody was supposed to even be here.
Thanks...... Burnham.
Wasn' t supposed to be like this.
She' s going to be okay.
She' s all right.
It' il be over soon.
Stephan.
Oh, my god.
Can you move?
Not much.
I think my arm is broken.
Raise your arm.
Come on, raise your arm.
Try again.
Try again.
Meg, please don' t do anything stupid.
They' re going to kill us.
Just do everything they ask.
It' il be okay that way.
Stephan, they' il kill her.
Holy shit.
She called the goddamn cops.
The police.
You called the police?
Of course, I called them.
You scared the shit out of me.
She killed the kid.
She just killed her own kid.
All right, take this.
Don' t say a word.
No, her husband must have called them.
I told you!
Where is she?
There.
What the fuck' s she doing?
She' s going to handle it.
I' m just trying to unlock....
- Is everything okay?
- You all right, ma' am?
What time is it?
It' s a little after 4: 00 a. m.
We got a call, ma' am.
Somebody called you?
Can we come in?
What do you want?
- No, you can' t come in.
Ma' am, you sure you' re all right?
I' m fine.
Ma' am, you don' t look so good.
Well, you don' t look so hot yourself, Officer Keeney.
Come on, I' m freezing out here.
"There are three".
What?
Your husband said you called for help.
That you said, "There are three" right before you got cut off.
Oh, that phone call.
And your neighbors...... called in about some loud shouts or a loudspeaker of some kind?
That was the TV.
It' s off now.
Can I just ask you one question?
What was the end of that sentence?
When you said, "There are three"...... what was the rest?
Look....
My husband and I just split up...... and it' s my first night in a new house...... and I admit I was a little drunk.
And the sentence, if you insist on knowing...... was going to be:
"There are three things that I' il do for you if you come jump into bed with me".
Thank God I came to my senses before I said all that, and I hung up...... so nobody would ever have to know what I was thinking.
Unless, of course...... two policemen came in the middle of the night and interrogated me.
So, Rick, you want to go?
Or do you want her to tell you which three things?
All right.
Ma' am...
... if there' s something you want to say to us...... but maybe you can' t say it right now...... you might want to make some kind of a signal...... by blinking your eyes a few times.
Something like that.
That' s something you could do safely.
Man...... you guys are good.
You mean, like if there was somebody in the house or something?
They really train you guys.
I' m fine.
Cross my heart.
Sorry to disturb you, ma' am.
'Night, ma' am.
This kid has seen my face.
Yeah, well, that' s not my problem.
Yeah, it is.
You' re here with me.
You' re on the hook, too.
Same price for the rest.
Stay the fuck away from me.
You know how this is going to end.
Goddamn!
What' s up?
Why the hell didn' t we do that?
What' s she doing?
What the fuck does she think she' s doing?
She' s got your gun.
Who told you to bring a gun?
Just let me drill, man.
Empty?
Come on, man.
Bank bonds.
One second.
Two, three, four, five....
Why are we doing this?
Because it' s going to come to that.
There are 22.
22 million dollars.
That lying little shit!
Let' s get out of here.
Lift.
Leave that.
Christ, I' il buy you new tools.
You' il be okay.
It' s glass.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Watch the glass.
Wait.
You don' t want to do that.
Dad, don' t shoot him!
Let my daughter go.
We' re finished.
Your daughter' s fine.
You' il never see us again.
Let her go.
Okay.
It' s okay.
Let' s go.
Let' s go.
Just let her go.
Let her go.
Let go of her!
Put that gun down.
- Sarah, come here.
- Sarah, come here.
- Put that gun down!
- Do as I say.
- Don' t be crazy, man.
- Just let her go.
- Let her go!
Are you okay?
- No.
- Did they touch you?
Shoot him!
Get off her!
You' il be okay now.
- Don' t move!
- Nobody move!
- Everybody on the ground!
Team two, upstairs.
Team three, down.
Are you okay?
Are you all right?
Freeze!
Don' t move, motherfucker!
I will kill you!
Move away from the wall!
Get off the fence!
Move!
Put your hands in the air!
It' il be okay.
It' s fine, Dad.
Is there anybody else in the house?
No.
Central, I need a bus at 38 West 94th.
It' s okay.
I' m all right.
I want to see the palms of your hands!
Do you hear me?
Open your hands!
Dad, it' s okay.
You' re going to be fine.
Everything is going to be fine.
This sounds interesting.
"... new kitchen, original bath, 70s East".
I thought you liked the West Side.
"61st and Central Park West.
"Bank foreclosure, must sell, luxury doorman building, health club... -"... conserg - "- Concierge.
- What' s that?
- It' s French for "superintendent".
What' s W. E. A. mean?
That' s West End Avenue.
"81st and West End Avenue.
"Three bedrooms plus den or fourth bedroom, spacious living room...
"... cathedral windows -"
Do we need all that space?
How about this?
"West 83rd, two- bedroom, doorman building...
"... park block, partial views, bright and cheery, high ceilings and wood floors".
That' s it, sir, you' re done.
We processed the film we found in your bag.
They' re not very pretty pictures.
Also, you left the camera in the hotel.
- We processed that roll as well.
- Can I see them?
That' s not a courtesy, Mr. Parrish, this is evidence.
Do you guys have your own lab, or do you have to send it out?
We have a lab.
Your legal aide should be here within 30 minutes or so.
You don' t have to talk to me until she gets here if you don' t want to.
You know that, Sy?
Good.
- Sy, can I ask you one question?
- Sure.
What was it about William Yorkin that upset you so?
Family photos depict smiling faces.
Births, weddings, holidays...... children' s birthday parties.
People take pictures of the happy moments in their lives.
Someone looking through our photo album...... would conclude that we had led a joyous, leisurely existence...... free of tragedy.
No one ever takes a photograph of something they want to forget.
We' re gonna go.
- Sure you don' t need my help?
- Yeah.
- Sorry, kiddo, I gotta work.
- Doesn' t matter!
- I' il get takeout for dinner, okay?
- Okay.
- See you.
- See you.
- Jake, are you coming, or what?
- I' m coming!
- There' s one.
- Okay.
For a minute.
I' m just dropping off some film.
Make sure you can see me.
- Hey, Mrs. Yorkin.
- Hey, Yoshi, how are you?
- How have you been?
- We' re doing good, thanks.
Got three rolls today.
- Can I get the address?
- It' s... 326 Serrano Terrace, Yoshi.
I' il take care of Mrs. Yorkin.
What have we got today?
Two rolls, and I think I' ve got one in here as well.
Can I have two prints of each, please?
Leica minilux.
That' s a very nice camera.
Really?
Will' s trying to get me to go digital...
I' d be out of a job.
- You have one shot left.
- That' s okay.
- It' s a shame to waste it.
- It' s fine.
- How' s Jake doing?
- He' s great.
He just had a birthday, and...
- How old is he, 9?
- That' s right, he just turned 9.
There we go.
Got a winner.
Thanks.
- When do you need these by?
- Can I have them today?
We close at 7 on Sundays.
Well, it' s not important.
I can swing by tomorrow.
You' re one of our best customers.
I' il have them for you by the time we close.
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.
- I' il do some shopping.
- See you in 40 minutes.
Thanks, Sy.
Bye.
Bye.
Hey, Jake.
You sliced through an exposure on that last roll.
Yes, Yoshi, I know.
I made a mistake.
Mrs. Levitt has a problem, offer her a free roll of film.
All right.
I' ve been doing P. O. S. mini- lab work for over 20 years now.
I consider it an important job.
When houses are on fire...... what' s the first thing people save after their pets and loved ones?
The family photos.
Some people think this is a job for a clerk.
They actually believe that any idiot attending a two- day seminar...... can master the art of making beautiful prints in less than an hour.
But of course, like most things...... there' s far more to it than meets the eye.
I' ve seen the prints they fob off on people at the Rexall or Fotek.
Milky, washed- out prints.
Too dark prints.
There' s no sense of reverence for the service they' re providing people.
I process these photos as if they were my own.
I see someone had quite a birthday party.
I wanted them 4- by- 6.
The larger ones are better.
I didn' t charge you extra for them.
It' s okay, I guess.
- How much do I owe you?
But let' s call it an even 30.
All right, thanks.
- We have a gift for birthday boys.
- Really?
That' s right.
Birthday boys get a free camera.
- Jake, what do you say?
- Thanks.
You' re welcome, buddy.
- I' il see you very soon.
- See you.
- Come on, Jake.
- See you, Jake.
- What a cool camera, huh?
Good night, A. J.
That' s just great.
- Nice truck.
- I remember that.
- You guys are so cute.
- This is a funny picture.
That is so sweet.
This one' s going into the trash.
Oh, my God.
Look at your face, that' s classic.
- I need that back.
- You' re not getting it back.
- I' m serious.
- Don' t give her it.
She' s serious.
Told you.
How' d this one get in here?
- Sy?
- Sy the photo guy.
- Sy took it to finish off the roll.
- Can I get you anything else?
- No, thanks, just the check' s fine.
- What you got there, family photos?
- Yeah.
You mind if I take a look?
These are beautiful.
That' s a good shot.
These your relations?
- Yes.
That' s my little nephew, Jake.
- He' s a handsome boy.
Isn' t he?
Yeah, I got him a camera for his birthday.
- You must be his favorite uncle, then.
- Oh, I don' t know.
Sure I can' t get you no more coffee, then?
- Oh, no.
I' m fine, thanks.
- Have a nice night, now.
You too.
Mom?
What, pookie?
I feel bad for someone.
Somebody at school?
No.
What do you mean, you feel bad?
When someone seems sad, they don' t have any friends...... and people make fun of them, that makes me feel bad for them.
Who is sad and doesn' t have any friends?
- Sy.
- Sy?
- The photo guy at the one- hour place?
- Yeah.
- Oh, Jake.
- I really feel bad for him.
But, Jake...... we don' t know that Sy is sad.
We really don' t know that much about him, you know.
I mean, he might even have a lot of friends.
And he probably has a girlfriend and a mommy and a daddy who love him.
I don' t think he does.
That is so sweet of you to think of somebody else like that, you know.
Listen, Jake...... not everybody is as lucky as we are.
You know?
But maybe if we send them good thoughts...... it' il make them feel better.
So why don' t we close our eyes and send Sy some good thoughts?
Okay?
All right.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
There.
I bet next time we see Sy...... he won' t seem so sad.
Okay.
- You have to go to sleep, pookie.
I love you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
There you go.
Come on.
How do you think we pay for all this?
I' m just asking you.
You think a money fairy slips an envelope under my pillow every month?
- What are you even talking about?
The new Mercedes, the matching washer and dryer...... the fucking Jil Sander blouse you have on now.
I love you, Nin, I do.
But if you want our life to look like something out of a magazine...... I' m sorry, I' ve gotta work to make that happen.
Do you even believe what you' re saying, huh?
And it' s not about money.
You' re neglectful.
- Do you understand that?
- What?
- Got it now?
- That' s fucking great.
Neglectful?
You' re not here, Will.
You' re not here.
You' re never here.
I' m going to bed.
If in your mind...
Bart, what' s wrong with you?
Oh, my God!
Someone' s trying to kill me!
Oh, wait, it' s for Bart.
Who' d wanna hurt me?
I' m this century' s Dennis the Menace.
It' s probably the person you least suspect.
Monday is our busiest day.
People shoot most of their pictures on weekends.
The store has several regular customers.
There' s Mrs. Von Unwerth, who only takes pictures of her cats.
I' ve never seen a picture of a human being.
Just cats.
Two copies, please, Mr. Parrish.
There' s Mr. Siskind.
Mr. Siskind is an insurance claims adjuster.
He only brings in pictures of wrecked cars.
The usual, Sy.
I need these by 3.
We get all the new parents, which makes up a big part of our business.
New parents go photo- crazy.
I don' t know how many rolls I have here.
Cindy, a nurse from a nearby cosmetic- surgery clinic, is a regular.
- We do all the before and after shots.
- Thanks, Sy.
Then there' s the amateur porn artists.
But anything else, no questions asked.
Larry, all I' m asking you to do is look at these prints.
Plus. 3?
Point three?
Nobody cares until the shift' s in double digits.
It' s blue, Larry.
Well, I' il bet Brandt cares about a plus. 3.
Are you fucking threatening me?
You' re breaking my balls over a plus- three blue shift?
Fucking asshole.
Next time you call me out here, that thing better be belching fire.
That' s a great attitude, Larry.
Thanks for your precision work!
- What the hell you doing?
- Excuse me?
What was the deal with you and the Agfa guy?
I' m preserving a level of quality for my customers.
Your customers.
It' s massive.
Sy, let me try and explain something to you one more time.
You need to look again at your place on the food chain.
These aren' t your customers, they' re Sav- Mart' s.
If you haven' t noticed, this isn' t Neiman Marcus.
If they wanted to see yelling, they' d stay at home.
It was wrong to create a scene in front of customers.
It won' t happen again.
Sy, don' t you have some vacation time saved up?
I guess I probably do.
You should take some time off, go down to a Club Med.
You know, relax, lay in the sun.
Enjoy life.
I' il think about that, Bill.
Your lunch break ended a half- hour ago.
What the hell you been doing in here?
I' m trying to figure out if this will work with my Mac.
This isn' t my section.
You' re Will Yorkin.
Sy Parrish.
I' m the photo tech here.
I do all your family' s pictures.
Oh, right.
Sy the photo guy.
Right.
Here you are in the flesh.
It' s just I don' t see you in here too often.
Nina usually does most of the shopping.
Can you help me with this?
It' s not my section.
I' m in a rush and I had one question I needed answered.
- No problem.
I' il get someone.
Customer needs immediate assistance, aisle 4.
Customer assistance, aisle 4.
- Someone will be here soon.
- Great.
You got it.
So is the rest of the family here?
Jake' s around here somewhere.
You' re a very lucky man, Mr. Yorkin.
I' m sorry?
And if you don' t mind my saying so, a very beautiful house too.
I really need to get this stuff and get the hell out of here.
I understand.
- Thanks for all your help.
- You say hello for me.
- I will do.
I gotta get back.
There you go.
Great.
No.
This is PC only.
We have some Mac- based stuff down here.
I was just talking to your dad.
- What do you have there?
- Evangelion.
Neon Genesis Evangelion.
What does he do?
He' s a good guy, he can fly and he has a silver sword that can kill bad guys.
- Really?
And he' s 60 feet tall.
- You really want this, don' t you?
- Yeah.
- No more toys, we' re leaving.
- Gotta go.
- Thanks.
- See you.
- See you later.
I told you not to talk to strangers.
I' m sure my customers never think about it...... but these snapshots are their little stands against the flow of time.
The shutter is clicked...... the flash goes off...... and they' ve stopped time...... if just for the blink of an eye.
And if these pictures have anything to say to future generations...... it' s this:
"I was here.
I existed.
I was young.
I was happy...... and someone cared enough about me in this world...... to take my picture. "
How much for this one?
But these are the things that make up the true picture of our lives.
You really have to tidy up your room, pal.
I' il bet your mother' s told you a thousand times.
Hey, Chaz.
It' s a good game.
- Hi, Sy.
- You said you were going out today.
Uncle Sy.
Can you help me put this together?
- How many prints would you like?
- Just one set.
Maya, that' s a very beautiful name.
Thank you.
- Have you picked up prints here before?
- Maybe once, a long time ago.
Your face looks very familiar.
You work around here?
Sort of near here.
- I' ve probably seen you at the mall.
- I' m in here pretty often.
We' re backed up today.
Is 6: 00 okay?
I won' t be able to pick them up till tomorrow or the next day.
- See you then.
Come on!
A little hustle.
Here we go.
Right there.
Come on.
Good shot.
That' s the way to strike the ball.
Get in front of those, son.
Jake, visualize where you want the ball to go and drill it.
Good one, Jake.
Jake, that' s not good enough.
We have to work on that.
Pay attention, fellas.
A little focus.
Drill it in there, Matt, come on!
Good shot.
Next practice, Thursday.
If you can' t make it, tell Derrick.
- Hey, Jake.
- Tobey, you forgot your sweatshirt.
On my way home, I saw you out there.
I thought I' d check it out.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Is your mom picking you up?
No, I got my bike.
It' s a great shot you made.
Your coach was a little rough.
He should be more supportive.
- Want me to have a word with him?
- I will.
- No, thanks.
When I was your age, I wasn' t very good at sports.
I was kind of a chubby kid.
Let' s face it.
I was fat.
I was sick all the time.
Then I broke my collarbone and had a weird cast...... that kept my arm up like this all winter.
I wasn' t exactly the most popular kid.
- How' d you break your collarbone?
- I fell out of a tree.
- How' s your dad doing?
- Does he come to see the games?
- Yeah, sometimes.
- Does he come to any games?
- He' s really busy at work.
- I don' t know, he' s busy all the time.
- Sounds like an important guy.
I guess.
He owns a company and everything.
Probably wants you and your mom to have nice things...... like that cool bike and those soccer shoes.
Hold on.
Those things cost money.
He' d be here if he could.
I guess.
I got something for you.
Wanna guess what it is?
What' s wrong?
It' s the one you wanted.
Mr. Parrish, I can' t take this.
Sure you can, Jake.
My parents wouldn' t let me.
I' d better be getting back home now.
- You sure?
- Yeah, thanks anyway, Mr. Parrish.
See you around the store.
- Hey, Jake.
The name' s Sy.
- Okay, Sy.
Well, there' s been, like, some kind of shift.
I don' t know.
A couple of weeks?
Six.
No, I know that, but...
Yeah, but this feels different, you know?
Listen, Jan, I can' t talk right now.
I' il call you back this afternoon.
Okay.
I know.
I love you too.
Bye.
- Hi, Sy.
- Hi, there.
I was at the Dairy Queen.
I saw you and thought I' d say hello.
- I' m just grabbing some shopping fuel.
- I never see you away from the store.
You' d think we' d run into each other.
- Why, do you live around here?
- I live downtown.
- Well, that' s quite a drive.
- You have a nice boy there.
- Oh, Jake.
Yeah.
A little sensitive, maybe, but...
He likes you, Sy.
- He calls you "Sy the photo guy."
- I' ve known him since he was this big.
That' s right.
You' ve been doing our pictures for a long time.
You know, I almost feel like "Uncle Sy."
Well, I' ve got some serious shopping to do.
Oh, sure.
Take care.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
It' s so weird.
I' m reading that exact book right now.
You' re kidding.
No, I can' t believe that you' d be reading that book.
He writes a lot about noticing coincidence, doesn' t he?
Yeah, he does.
That thing he says about fear...
"The things we fear the most have already happened to us."
I had no idea you were such a deep thinker, Sy.
I wouldn' t say that.
- Do you have any children, Sy?
No.
No, I' m not married.
- No girlfriend?
I have a snapshot of my mother, though.
- She looks very nice.
- She' s passed away.
I' m sorry, Sy.
Gosh, you know, I have to go.
- It was really nice chatting with you.
- It was nice chatting with you.
I' il probably see you soon.
We can' t go a day without taking a picture.
Sy Parrish, please see the manager.
Sy to the manager' s office immediately, please.
- What' s with the getup?
- It' s Wednesday.
I was doing the SRS.
There' s been some discrepancies in the click count.
His math skills are weak.
I told you that when you moved him.
The discrepancies are on logs you initialed.
- Yeah.
I guess sometimes at the end of the week, you get a little tired...
We' re not talking a few innocent math errors.
They always zero out.
The problem is the shut- down clicks don' t correspond.
They don' t come close to matching the amount of prints we' ve sold.
Then it' s probably the reorder counter.
- Well, I asked Larry about that.
- What did he say?
He looked at the counter and said that it checked out.
Also, in 14 years of servicing...... he' s never seen a faulty counter on an Agfa.
Really?
The question is, where did all those unaccounted- for prints go?
- What' s the discrepancy, Bill?
- We' re talking hundreds of prints, Sy.
That' s not possible, Bill.
I' ve done the math.
The P. O. 's confirm it too.
- I don' t know anything about it.
- Well, I think you do, Sy.
Well, I don' t, Bill.
Look, Sy, I' ve got a family.
I' m not losing my job over this.
I' m letting you go.
No.
-... giving away free merchandise.
- What?
Free disposable cameras to customers on their birthday?
Sure as shit isn' t company policy.
- You can' t do this.
- It' s done.
I talked to Sims at district.
Finish out the week and clear out your locker.
I haven' t fucked up a customer' s prints in 11 years.
Just get back out there.
Hey, Sy.
Jake wanted to get his birthday gift processed.
I' m sorry?
The camera?
Right.
The birthday gift.
- Number of sets?
- Just one is fine.
4- by- 6, 5- by- 7?
The ones we usually get.
Standard.
Jake had a great time with the camera, didn' t you?
What was that address again?
It' s 326 Serrano Terrace.
- Sy, are you all right?
- I' m fine.
I' il have these for you tomorrow.
Thanks, Sy.
Bye.
I' m leaving early today, Yoshi.
Okay, Sy.
I won' t be coming back, Yoshi.
Bill let me go.
You were fired?
- Really?
- Really.
I' ve really enjoyed working with you, Yoshi.
Yeah, me too, Sy.
Sy, I just wanted to...
I guess I just wanted to say thank you.
- For what?
- For teaching me all this stuff.
You' re welcome, Yoshi.
- Don' t let the place go downhill, okay?
- I won' t, Sy.
- Here they are.
- My pictures.
Let me see.
Come on.
What the hell' s wrong with these people?
The universe grows smaller every day.
There must be security for all, or no one is secure.
It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet.
But if you threaten to extend your violence...... this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned- out cinder.
Now, we do not pretend to have achieved perfection.
But we do have a system, and it works.
Join us and live in peace...... or pursue your present course and face obliteration.
We shall be waiting for your answer.
The decision rests with you.
According to the Oxford English Dictionary...... the word "snapshot" was first used in 1808...... by an English sportsman by the name of Sir Andrew Hawker.
"Snapshot," then, was originally a hunting term.
Can I help you?
Just dropping off some film.
Just a customer.
- I can still shop here, can' t I?
- No, you can' t still shop here.
I believe I can.
There' s no law that says I can' t shop here because I was fired.
- I checked.
- There' s other places to do photos.
There' s a good reason.
I calibrated that machine personally.
It' s the best mini- lab in the state.
All right, Sy.
Just this one time.
But find another place to do your film.
I do not want you back in here.
Thanks, Bill.
What is it?
You can' t just leave your station unmanned.
- You need to see these, sir.
- Is it the anal sex fiend again?
Motherfucker.
What was Mr. Parrish' s demeanor when he came in?
- Demeanor?
- Yeah.
How did he seem?
Did he seem upset or agitated in any way?
- I don' t know, he seemed fine.
- Sy and I had words when he came in.
I was surprised to see him, and asked him what he was doing here.
I suggested in strong language that he bring his pictures somewhere else.
I need Xerox copies of this.
Can you show me where I can get that done?
Mr. Owens, why don' t you grab a seat and try to calm down?
Your wife and child, they' re somewhere safe now?
They' re at my mother' s.
No, no, no, no.
I understand.
It' s understandable.
So how did he take his being fired?
I' ve fired a lot of people.
People get upset when they get fired.
He got pretty upset.
He knew Mr. Araki would show the photos to you and that you' d call us.
I think it' s just a warning.
- You have to take it seriously.
- We take it very seriously.
Your child' s life was indirectly threatened.
We take no chances.
There' s an APB on him.
Officers are en route to his home with a search warrant.
He may come back and pick up his photos.
He may not.
It' s hard to say.
Is that a good idea?
This place is wall- to- wall families.
If he' s stupid enough to come back, he' il never make it inside the store.
Mr. Parrish?
This is the police.
If you' re in the apartment, we need to know right now.
Kill that TV.
Mr. Parrish!
It' s clear.
Double 6, 3- 2- 1.
- Go ahead, 3- 2 - 1.
I need to be patched through to Van Der Zee in TMU.
3- 2 - 1, that' s a 10- 4.
Hey, Dan, take a look at this.
What do you got?
Y- O- R- K- l- N.
I' m sorry, sir.
I don' t find that name registered.
Could you try a Maya Burson?
B- U- R- S- O- N.
Let me check that for you, sir.
- I' il ring that room for you now, sir.
- Hello?
- Hello.
This is room service.
Sorry to bother you, but we have your order ready.
We need to know if you' d like coffee with that.
Will, did you want coffee?
No, just the drinks.
And this is for room 217.
No, we' re 5 11, right?
5 11.
Oh, my gosh.
I must be looking at the wrong thing here.
I' m sorry.
We' il have it up in just a minute.
Thanks.
- Hotel operator.
- Room service, please.
Room service, this is Jon.
May I take your order?
Jon, this is Will Yorkin in 5 11.
- No problem.
That was 5 11?
Thank you very much.
You' re welcome, Mr. Yorkin.
- Nina Yorkin?
- Yes.
I' m Detective Van Der Zee of the Threat Management Unit.
- This is Detective Outerbridge.
- Threat Management?
Everyone' s fine.
We actually need to speak with your husband.
Will' s at work.
What' s this about?
- You mind if we come in for a minute?
Sure.
- How can I help you, sir?
- Hi.
I need a room.
But not too high a floor.
I' il check, sir.
Yes, we can offer you 313.
Anything on five?
- Will Yorkin' s office.
- It' s Nina.
I need to talk to Will.
He' s not in.
I' il have him return when he gets back.
Duane, get him on the phone immediately.
This is an emergency.
I' il try him now.
I' il put you on hold.
No, Duane...
- Where' s your son?
- He' s at his friend Eric' s house.
It might be a good idea to have Eric' s mother drive him home.
Oh, my God.
- Mrs. Yorkin?
- Yes, Duane.
There was no answer, but I left him a 911 page.
I know he' s fucking Maya Burson.
I don' t care about that now.
I just need you to tell me where he is!
- Get it yourself.
Room service.
Can you just leave it outside the door, please?
I' m afraid you have to sign for this.
Just a second.
Get on the bed.
Get on the goddamn bed!
- I' ve got plenty of cash in my pants...
Close the drapes.
Close them!
- I closed the drapes.
Did I tell you to wrap a towel around yourself?
Let me explain what' s going on here.
Then you do them exactly like I tell you.
I' m gonna tell you this one time and one time only.
You got the picture?
- Do you understand me?
Good.
Now, get on the bed.
No!
Am I talking to a brick wall?
Did I tell you to touch her?
- I don' t want you to touch her.
If you touch her again, I stab you in the heart.
Proceed to Deerfield, the Edgerton Hotel at Hunter Valley Road.
TMU officers en route to scene.
- Can you ring the room again?
- I' il try one more time.
You have to take the robe off.
No.
I' m not asking, I' m telling.
She can do it!
The person in this room is not available.
What' s this?
What' s this?!
Can' t you stop your sniveling?
This is supposed to look like fun.
Okay.
No touching!
Smile.
You have to look like you' re having fun, like it' s a game.
Come on!
Smile!
Wipe your nose.
You look disgusting.
Put his thing in your mouth.
Don' t do it!
- Pretend.
- I' m doing it!
Stop yelling at me!
You' re not doing it the right way.
Like this!
No!
- Mr. Belmer?
- Yes.
Detectives Van Der Zee and Outerbridge.
Right.
So, what is all this about?
- Any word from Miss Burson yet?
- No.
Have you seen this man?
- He checked in about half an hour ago.
- What room?
I need a pass key.
Now, please.
Mr. Parrish, this is the police.
Will you open the door?
The retinal implant is a microelectronic prosthesis...... that can reverse the effects of retinal degeneration.
We owe a...
James.
Check 5 11.
Where is it?
- It' s the rear kitchen access.
- It' s in the back, rear kitchen access.
Police!
Freeze!
William Yorkin?
Drop the bag!
Do it!
- I just took pictures.
- You have the right to remain silent.
Outerbridge?
We got him.... the attorney present during questioning.
Dad!
Are you married, detective?
You have any children?
- I' il be the one asking the questions.
- I know.
Just one question.
Are you a family man?
- You' re right.
It isn' t.
It is none of my business.
But I' m guessing by your answer and that ring on your finger that you are.
A good husband and father, a man who appreciates his good fortune.
You' re not the type of father who' d cheat on his wife...... hurt his family, betray their trust.
You would never neglect and abuse your children.
Make horrible demands of your children.
You would never ask...
You would never ask your children to do things...
Things that children shouldn' t do.
You would never take disgusting, sick, degrading pictures...... of your children doing these things!
You would never treat your children like animals.
Will Yorkin had it all, and he threw it all away.
He is not a good father.
I think I understand now, Sy.
Thank you for answering my questions so candidly.
You' re welcome.
Can I see my pictures now?
Sure, Sy.
Thank you.

Vodka.
Is it cold?

I keep it in the freezer.
So do I, at home.
So tell me, how did you...... meet my wife?
By accident.
On the street.
There was a windstorm, she hurt her knee and....
You' re him.
She told you about that?
Yes.
How' s it going?
Fine.
Fine.
I mean, okay.
- This is where you meet?
- Yes.
- She likes it?
- I guess.
She never complained.
Do you stay in all the time, or do you go out too?
It depends.
Sometimes we go out.
And she likes that?
She likes this neighborhood?
More exciting than the suburbs, I guess.
Do you know we have been married 1 1 years?
We have a son.
She told me.
More?
Yes, please.
He' s the reason that we left the city.
Connie thought it' d be better for him.
She told me it was your idea.
You talk about me?
A lot of books.
A lot of buying and selling.
I didn' t know it did that.
- Where did you get this?
- It was a gift.
From her.
- Why would she do that?
- I don' t know.
Maybe she just wanted to buy me something.
She didn' t buy this for you.
I gave it to her.
- I can' t do this.
- What?
I can' t do this.
I can' t do this.
I' m feeling sick.
I can' t...
You want some water?
I' m feeling sick.

Hi, it' s me.
Listen.
I don 't like saying this to your machine...... but I have to end this.
I can 't do it anymore.
I can 't live like this.
I' m so tired of lying and hurting my family.
I' m sorry.
And I hope...
I don 't know what I hope.
I' m sorry.

Does that pinch?
No.
- Do you know your solo?

Can I hear it?

Thanks.
Where were you?
You okay?
You were spectacular, you know that?
- Wasn' t he great?
- Great.
He was great.
Great.
Really great.
I have to help clean up.
I' il kiss you good night when I get home, okay?
- Sorry, Ed.
Looks like I nailed you.
- It' s all right.
It' s all right, Jerry.
You better check to see if this will open.
It' s nothing.
This is fine.
- Did he dent you, Dad?
- Yes, he did.
Yes.
Can we call the cops, Dad?
- Let' s check the trunk.
- We' il talk tomorrow.
- It' il just take a second.
- No!
Oh, my God.
Charlie, look at your dad and tell me what' s wrong.
What?
His shoes.
They' re different colors.
Honey, you look awful.
What happened last night?
Did you sleep?
I got up and looked for you.
I just...
... got some air.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Do you like it here?
What?
Of course I like it here.
We don' t have to stay here.
We can move back to the city.
Honey, what has gotten into you?
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Fine.
- Are you okay?
- I' m fine.
Everybody' s fine.
And we' re not moving anywhere.
The cops are here, Mom.
- What do they want?
- I' m sure it' s nothing.
N. Y. P. D., Mom.
Mrs. Sumner?
I' m Detective Dean, this is Detective Mirojnick, N. Y. P. D.
Something happen?
Is something wrong?
Do you know a Paul Martel?
- Yes, not very well.
Why?
- Do you know where he is?
No.
At home, I would imagine.
Do you know where he lives?
SoHo, isn' t it?
Your name and number were found on his desk.
- Has he done something wrong?
- We don' t know.
He' s been reported missing by his family.
His wife doesn' t know where he is.
I didn' t know he was married.
Separated.
When did you see him last?
I don' t know, it' s hard to say.
He' s a book dealer.
I barely know him.
I was going to buy books from him.
- And did you?
- No, not yet.
Has something happened?
You think he' s all right?
It' s hard to say at this point.
We' re working on it.
Thanks for your time.
- Thank you.
I like these snow- glass things.
My boy has some of these.
- lf you hear from him, let us know.
- Certainly.
Dad!
Cops came to our house today.
Cops?
What did they want?
Someone' s missing.
And they have to check everyone, you know.
Who was it?
Honey, sit up straight.
- Who was it?
- I don' t think you know him.
He sells books.
I forget where I met him.
Was it a bad guy, Mom?
Why did they want to talk to you?
I guess he had my name and number.
Why would he have your number?
I think I bought a book from him.
- Be careful.
Take it easy.
- Hey, Charlie!
Oh, my darling.
Oh, I wished you lived closer.
And help us be ever mindful of the needs of others.
Amen.
Amen.
Very nice, Edward.
All right!
I have a story you don' t know about Edward.
Gather close.
Hello, Mrs. Sumner.
Sorry to bother you on the weekend.
I' m Detective Dean.
- This is Detective Mirojnick, N. Y. P. D. - Okay.
We were hoping to talk to you for a few minutes.
Sure.
- Charlie, we' re going up on the porch.
- Can I come?
No, sweetheart.
Stay out here.
Play with Poppy, we' il be right back.
I don' t know if your wife mentioned, we were here a week ago.
About Paul Martel.
Yeah, the man who was missing.
Well, he' s not missing anymore.
His body was discovered last weekend.
God, that' s terrible.
Oh, my God.
Do you recall where you met Mr. Martel, Mrs. Sumner?
- I told you.
- No, ma' am, you didn' t.
I' m sorry.
I can' t remember.
A fundraiser, I think.
Can you be more specific?
Juilliard.
Juilliard?
The music school.
- Yes, I know what Juilliard is.
- Of course you do.
I' m sorry.
Were you there too, sir?
Yes.
Yes, I think I was.
Well, maybe you met Mr. Martel.
No.
No, not that I remember.
Maybe you' d recognize him.
No, I' ve never met him before.
- Is that him?
- Yes.
Yes.
You ever been to his apartment?
No.
No, I hardly knew him.
- I didn' t know why he had my number.
- Maybe he liked you.
Look, that' s enough.
So you' ve never been to his apartment.
How about the neighborhood?
- Hang out down there?
- No.
No, not often...... or no, never.
Never.
I can' t remember the last time I was in SoHo.
It was four weeks ago, actually.
You got a parking ticket in front of Martel' s apartment, four weeks ago.
Oh, that.
Right.
I had coffee with friends at a little place.
I forgot.
- It was Tracy and Sally.
- Oh, yeah.
Yes.
Yep.
... my wife has told you everything she knows, so have I.
If you don' t mind, we' d like to get back to our son.
All right.
- Why don' t I give you my card?
- I have your card.
Right.
- Enjoy your weekend.
- You too.
Sumner, please.
Oh, my God.
Connie?
Hi, Tracy.
I' m just picking up my silk suit for tonight.
I was thinking of wearing the black.
I' m giving it to Goodwill.
Let someone else be gorgeous for a change.
What should we bring, aside from our sparkling personalities?
- How we doing?
- Fine.
- Need help?
- No.
Well, the white is not cold, so I' m gonna put it in the freezer.
Just remind me it' s in there, all right?
Most people drink red anyway.
I love these things.
Is there any place you guys haven' t been?
The Rosenthals got 795 for their place.
- In two days they had six offers.
- Sealed bids is how they do it now.
What do you think this place is worth, Ed?
I don' t know.
If you sell your house, where do you go?
- At those prices, Tahiti.
- Bangkok.
Connie, where is this one from?
Fiji.
Remember, Jeff, I asked you to take me to Fiji.
And then you took me to Hawaii.
We went fishing every single....
What happened, Edward?
What did you do?
Did you hurt him?
Edward?
Did you hurt him?
You did, didn' t you?
Jesus, Edward.
Talk to me.
Tell me what you did!
No, you tell me what you did.
How you fucked him, over and over and over.
You lied to me!
- Over and over and over.
- Edward, please...
No, you don' t talk to me now.
I gave everything...... for this family.
Everything.
And what did you do?
You threw it all away, like it was nothing.
For what?
To the fucking kid.
You didn' t think I' d know?
I wouldn' t feel it?
I knew it from the very first day.
Because I know you, Connie.
I know you and I fucking hate you.
I didn' t want to kill him, I wanted to kill you!
Oh, my God.
Edward.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Mom, look what I did.
Honey, it' s okay.
That' s okay.
I' m sorry, Mom.
It' s an accident.
Everybody has accidents.
Why aren' t you in bed, Mom?
I don' t know.
Charlie, look at me.
I want you to know...... that I love you, more than anything in the world.
And I want you to know that your daddy and me both...... will always, always love you.
No matter what.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Come on, sweetie.
Let' s go fix up your bed all nice and fresh, okay?
All right.
You can come on up and clean it off, no?
Come on.
I' m not an ax murderer.
I promise.
Taxi.
Thank you.
What are we going to do?
I' m so scared.
I' il turn myself in.
No.
No.
No, we can get through this.
We' il take it one day at a time.
No one will know.
We' il know.
3200, 3500, 3800, 4000...... 42, 45, 4800!
We can disappear.
We can raise some money.
Sell everything and just leave the country.
Senorita?
Mexico.
Why not?
We can get a little house on the beach.
Take a different name.
People do it all the time.
What will we tell Charlie?
Tell him it' s an adventure.
We could fish all day.
We could learn to play the guitar.
I would serenade you to sleep every night.
We' il just live the rest of our lives on that beach.
And then when we die, we can just push out to sea.
What do you think?
Sounds perfect.

What' s the core temperature?
Seven hundred and twenty- five degrees.
Entering airlock.
Come on.
Easy.
How is it in there?
Doctor.
Doctor.
Take them to bow torpedo.
Keep them as far away from the radiation as possible.
- How do you feel?
- It' s all right.
Good.
Give me his dosimeter.
Thankyou.
Yes?
Yes, of course.
Report to me on their condition, in an hour.
Good news, Anatoly.
You got a mild dose.
- All right.
All right.
- Gently.
It' s time.
Comrades, it' s time.
Put your mask on.
Hey, come on.

Look at me.
Come on!
Wake up!
It' s time to go.
Go, go.
It' s all right.
Chief.
Medic.
Come on.
I have him.
Chief Gorelov' s gone in his place.
Good boy.
Captain.
You sent for me?
Yes.
We won' t be firing any missiles.
So, do you know how to take radiation readings?
- Yes, Comrade Captain.
- I want readings from all compartments.
Yes, Captain.
- Temperature?
- Nine hundred twenty- five degrees.
How long?
Seven minutes, forty seconds.
Set him down.
Chief!
Chief!
Yes.
Konstantin is getting him.
He' s getting him.
You did good.
You did good.
He' s getting him.
We' il get him.
Yes, yes, yes.

Yeah, you showed them.

The reactor appears to be under control.
Ourthanks to ChiefEngineer Gorelov... and the third watch reactor unit... for a job well done.
Rest, boy.
- Ship' s heading?
- 2- 2- 0, Captain.
Turn the boat around.
Come to a heading of 0- 4- 0.
Forward motor, slow ahead.
Starboard, 30.
- Course, 0- 4- 0.
- Forward motor, slow ahead.
Starboard, 30.
Standard course, 0- 4- 0.
Back to base?
With a speed of five knots, it' il take days.
We shall be a ghost ship.
Captain.
- The men are hungry.
- The food is contaminated.
Give them whateveryou have in tins or in foil.
And give them red wine to slow the rate of radiation absorption.
Very well, Captain.
But in the reactor room, it' s ten times that.
Turn off the ventilation system.
All compartments, shut down main ventilation.
Captain, ifwe --
We' il run the boat with skeleton crews.
Put the men on top... as far away from the radiation as possible.
We' re 1 60 kilometers from the NATO base in Jan Mayan.
We could go there, get help from the Americans.
Under no circumstances... will I abandon my boat or my crew to the enemy.
What is your plan?
We' re out of radio contact.
Ifwe stay on our course... fleet command will send the diesels to find us.
Radiation levels are rising too fast.
We' re just running on electric motors.
There' s no time for that.
They will find us.
As usual, the captain leaves no room for doubt.
Good.
You' re fine.
You' re fine, Yevgeny.
Next.
Good.
Next.
Icons... are forbidden.
Contact bearing 0- 1 - 5.
Range 2, 000 meters, Captain.
Wait, wait!
Wait, wait!
They' re Americans.
Captain.
The jackals have found us.
It' s an American destroyer.
Captain.
The Americans are contacting us on the emergency band.
The helicopter' s reported our men on deck.
The captain is offering assistance.
Tell them we don' t require assistance.
We' re just getting some air.
- What are they doing?
- Taking pictures of us.
Hey, spies!
Take a look at this!
- Hey, you take a look at this!
- Everybody!
Look at this lovely, lovely boat.
Offering assistance.
They want this boat.
What a victory that would be.
The waters here are over a mile deep.
We could get the men off, scuttle the boat.
- They' d have to take us.
- Captain Polenin is right.
We have the life rafts.
We can save everyone.
Scuttle the flagship of the fleet?
Present my crew to the Americans for interrogation?
You must save their lives.
My duty is to defend the state... and I will do that to my last dying breath.
You' re defending nothing but your own ambition.
Tell that to the men who are dying down there.
Tell them.
There will be no more talk of surrendering to the Americans.
It is treason.
I will have you confined to your quarters.
And you, you are the commissar... representative of the party, responsible for crew morale.
- Yes, Captain.
- Then act like it.
The crew need you to show courage, not fear.
- Fear is contagious.
- Yes, Captain.
- Yes, Captain?
- Stop monitoring the Americans.
- They are the enemy.
- Yes, Captain.
Help me.
Please.
- How are the men?
- How would I know?
I don' t know the first thing about radiation sickness.
Please.
I' m giving them aspirin.
And I' m trying to prevent those that are dying... from irradiating those of us that still have some hope.
Pull yourself together.
You are an officer in the Soviet Navy.
Go back and tell them that they' re improving.
As you say, you know nothing about radiation sickness.
Perhaps they are.
- Captain.
- Yes?
Readings are rising in every compartment now.
- Comrade Suslov.
- What is it?
The radiation is going to kill us all.
The political branch gives you the authority... to approve any change of command.
Only in extreme cases of dereliction of duty.
Which this is.
He' s suffering from radiation poisoning himself.
His judgment' s impaired, or he would get the men off the boat.
When the moment comes, we will know it.
The weld is giving way!
The core temperature is 450 degrees and rising.
Captain.
- The reactor repair has failed.
- Captain.
Core temperature is 450 degrees and rising.
This is the captain.
All hands below decks.
Prepare for emergency descent.
All hands below!

We have to go now!
Andrei, no!
No, Andrei!
What are you doing!
Diving now!
Diving now!
Move!
Go!
Get in!
Get in the hatch!
That' s an order!
- Move it!
- We can' t just leave him here!
Are the Americans still offering assistance?
- The captain said not to -- - Check.
- They' re still there.
- Why is he diving?
He' il cook us.
- No!
I won' t go!
- Hey!
- Yevgeny!
We' re diving!
- No!
Prepare the tank!
Quickly!
Give it to me!
This is bullshit!
Put me down!
Fire in aft torpedo!
Let' s go!
- Aft torpedo?
- Come on.
Report!
Fire in aft torpedo.
We have no communication.
- Our fire team is suiting up.
- Activate the fire system.
- That will kill everybody in there.
- The torpedos will kill everyone.
- They have breathing kits.
- They don' t.
We took their oxygen for the reactor team.
- Give the fire team some time.
- Activate the system.
The primary was never connected.
It has to be activated locally.
Go to nine and turn on the system.
You refuse my order?
I' il do it myself.
You leave the command center, I will get help from the Americans... and you will be in no position to stop me.
Ifwe can' t handle it, I' il switch on the system myself.
Get the fire out.
And quickly!
Why aren' t we diving?
Under the authority given to me by the party... you are hereby removed from your post for dereliction of duty.
Isolate electrical!
You' re wasting time.
Get a team to repair the reactor.
Torpedo number eight!
Kornilov, tell the Americans we are evacuating the submarine... and will require assistance.
Send the message.
US destroyer.
US destroyer.
This is Soviet submarine.
Over.
Comrade Admiral.
General Vershinin, KGB.
I want to know ifyour man Vostrikov is a traitor.
All we know is that K- 1 9 has broken off radio contact.
Broken radio contact with us.
A reconnaissance plane has spotted a destroyer... shadowing K- 1 9.
An American destroyer.

- Shut up!
You have no idea what you' re doing.
Easy, easy.
- Who is it?
- It' s Dmitri.
Captain Polenin to central command.
- Repeat.
Captain Polenin!
- Do what you can, Vanya.
- It' s all right.
- Central command.
Immediately!
Five men.
Captain Polenin, I have exercised my authority... to transfer the boat to your command.
You' re our captain and always have been.
We' ve contacted the Americans.
All that is needed is your order to abandon ship.
Good.
Good.
Weapons don' t belong here.
Give them to me.
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun and the key for the handcuffs.
Give it to me.
This boat' s a family.
- Of course, Captain.
- And the key for the handcuffs.
Captain.
You betray your family.
You betray me.
- You' re under arrest.
The both ofyou!
Get out of my sight!
Take their guns.
Lock them in their quarters.
Captain Polenin, it' s treason!
The fire in compartment ten has been extinguished.
The suppression system was not required.
Unfortunately, there was only one survivor.
Thankyou.
- Captain.
- Captain.
We have to dive.
This is the captain.
Don' t order them, Captain.
Ask them.
This is the captain.
Our situation is desperate.
The reactor repair has failed.
At any moment, we could have an explosion... which could set off the warheads.
This would destroy the American ship... only a few kilometers... from the NATO base.
Given the current level oftensions... between our countries... this could result in horrifying retaliatory attacks... on the motherland.
We could dive... and attempt to repair the reactor.
There are no guarantees.
I am standing by.
Secure both bulkhead doors.
Compartment ten isolated.
Compartment nine clear ofsmoke... manned and ready.
Compartment eight serving the Soviet Union, Comrade Captain.
Compartment seven standing by to do our duty, Comrade Captain.
Compartment five manned and ready..
We await your orders, Captain.
We are with you, Comrade Captain.
Ready to dive, Captain.
- Dive the boat.
- Dive the boat.
Make her depth 300 meters.
Keep five degrees.
- Flood all main ballast.
- Flood all main ballast.
- Electric motors full ahead together.

Keep five degrees, bow down.
Radtchenko.
Lieutenant Radtchenko.
Lieutenant Radtchenko, report.
Captain, reactor temperature' s 760 degrees and rising.
Lieutenant Radtchenko.
- Where is he?
- He' s inside.
How long has he been in there?
- Eighteen minutes.
- Eighteen minutes?
Wait.
Captain.
- You can' t go in without your -- - Secure the hatch.
I can' t see.
I can' t see.
- Let me help you.
- Captain.
- I' m sorry.
Open the hatch!
- 280 meters.
- Level off.
Coming through.
970 degrees and holding, Captain.
Open the bulkhead door.
He got a terrible dose.
Who' s going in next?
Captain, the temperature' s falling.
He did it.
He turned himself into a hero.
Surface the boat.
- Blow the main ballast.
- Keep rising the planes.
- Keep 1 5 degrees by the bow.
- Motors at full ahead together.
- You have the conn.
- Full rise, 1 5 degrees by the bow.
I have the conn.
Signal the American captain as soon as we surface.
Tell him we require his assistance.
Yes, Captain.
Yes, Captain.
- Up periscope.
- Periscope going up.
Men... you have done your duty for the motherland.
The party is proud ofyou.
I am -- I am proud ofyou.
Captain.
Captain.
Yes, Vadim.
I' m here.
The weld, is it holding?
Yes, Vadim, the weld is holding.
You' re a hero, Vadim.
Do you hear?
You are a hero.
You are all... all of you... heroes.
I had hoped one of our own boats would find us.
The radiation levels are rising too quickly.
I have asked the American captain...
for his help.
Prepare to abandon the boat.
American destroyer, bearing 0- 4- 5.
Range, 2, 000 meters.
Captain, I have a contact!
- What the -- - Captain!
- The boat could be in trouble.
- What sort of trouble?
I' ve known Captain Vostrikov personally for half his life.
There isn' t a submariner in the navy whose loyalty I trust more.
More than his father' s loyalty?
I never knew his father.
Captain.
Captain.
When my father went to sea... he used to carry these... great handfuls of dirt in his pockets.
"A bit of the motherland," he said.
He would rather die than betray his country.
Contact me from the bridge when the last lifeboat is loaded.
I' il sink the boat.
The Americans won' t get her.
That won' t be necessary, Captain.
Our submarine, S270, has found us.
Yes.
Yes.
Confirm and out.
Reply from Moscow, Captain, sent through S270.
Your request to remove the men from the boat... is denied, Comrade Captain.
They' re sending a freighter to tow us back to base.
Anything else?
They said --
They said to give the men plenty of fresh fruit.
I want my men off this boat.
I am countermanding Moscow.
You know that it will be the end of your career.
They' il send you to the gulag, like your father.
Well, it' s a family tradition, isn' t it?
Let' s go!
Let' s go!
- Come on!
- We' ve got you.
Easy.
Easy.
Good.
Good man.
You must be decontaminated.
Do you understand?
We must make you clean.
You' il be warmer inside.
You must take your clothes off.
We will decontaminate you and destroy the clothes.
- Then you can go down below.
- Take off your pants.
Easy.
- Back this way.
- Watch the rope.
- Pass it over.
- Come on, pull it.
Be careful there.
This is your boat, Misha.
I lost my position, Yuri, but not my self- respect.
You lost both.
- Where am I going?
- Bring a blanket here.
They' re taking you across, Vadim.
I need my picture of Kataya.
- Where is it?
- In my pocket.
Here you are.
There it is.
I can' t see.
I can' t see her.
All men accounted for, Captain.
Why didn' t you take command when you had the chance?
Because what they did was wrong.
Prepare the tow, Captain.
Captain.
- Move all these men out.
- Move back.
Lev, you' re a welcome sight.
Moscow thought you were defecting with your boat.
They want me to make a list of the men who are fit enough to testify.
Testify?
About what?
About you.
Make sure all the lines are secure.
- Come on.
- Thankyou, Doctor.
We did it.
We' re going home.
At every stage ofthis disaster, which came within moments... of being a far greater disaster... the officers and crew did what had to be done.
Seven are now dead... and nobody knows how many more are dying... or how fast.
These are the men who returned home to be interrogated... as if a crime had been committed... questioned even when undergoing treatment for radiation poisoning...
But they and their comrades saved K - 19.
And maybe... just maybe, they saved all of you as well.
Thank you, Captain Polenin.
- One thing more, please.
No captain in the Soviet Navy has ever been faced with such decisions -- the fate of the boat, the crew... the fate of the world... all in the balance.
The navy is my life.
And one thing I know, there can be only one captain of a ship.
The burden of command is on his shoulders... and his alone.
None of you --
None of you has the right to judge Captain Vostrikov.
You weren' t there.
He was our captain.
He was my captain.
And it would be an honor... to sail under his command again.
East Germany has agreed to do... what the West has been demanding it should do for more than a generation.
After opening up the Berlin Wall, the government has now announced... it will hold democratic elections. it will hold democratic elections.
You' re not so tall as I remember.
It' s good to see you.
And you.
Please.
I' m glad you found me... but today was, in fact, not very convenient.
It had to be today.
Your crew.
It was 28 years ago today.
Captain, a toast.
To the men still on patrol.
For their courage, I nominated these men... for the title Hero of the Soviet Union.
But the committee ruled... that because it was not wartime...
because it was merely an accident... they were not worthy of the title Hero.
What good are honors from such people?
These men sacrificed... not for a medal... but because, when the time came... it was their duty... not to the navy... or to the state...
but to us... their comrades.
And so... to comrades.
To comrades!
[Silence]
[Gasps]
Where are they?
I don' t know.
Dad!
Uncle Merrill!
Dad!
[Rapid footsteps]
Bo?
Bo?
Bo, where' s Morgan?
Bo?
Are you in my dream, too?
-- This is not a dr -- - Dad!
Hey...
[Panting]
Morgan?
What' s happening?
[Dogs barking in distance]
Are you hurt?
I think God did it.
Did what, Morgan?
[Barking continues, birds cawing]
[Barking]
Look, Lee, I don' t even care if it was him.
And you can just have a word with him, and that' d be enough for me.
See, it was strange finding the crops that way.
The kids were confused by it, and, uh, it' d sure take the strangeness away, if I know it was just Lionel and the Wolfington brothers messing around, that' s all.
At the movies?
Are you sure?
All right, then.
Uh, thanks for your patience, Lee.
Yeah.
Bye.
Houdini peed.
I think he' s sick.
Why don' t you take him outside?
I' il call Dr. Crawford.
He doesn' t treat animals.
[Door hinges creak; door opens, slams]
Oh.
That was quick, Caroline.
I only called you folks two hours ago.
Old Mrs. Kendleman twisted her ankle, as she puts it, diving for her life when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards.
She went down to Thornton' s store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards.
Spitting!
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed the whole damned place.
And she must have had a cold or something.
[Sighs deeply]
[Sizzling]
Dad' s gonna burn these again.
It' s contaminated.
You don' t even know what that word means.
It' s not contaminated.
It' s just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.
It tastes funny.
It does not.
And besides, he licks his butt every day.
[Growling]
Houdini?
Bo, don' t run.
[Growling continues]
[Gasps]
Look at where it' s bent over, Father.
It' s not broken.
Now, what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without breaking it?
Can' t be by hand.
It' s too perfect.
It doesn' t sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.
They can' t take a piss without wetting the front of their pants.
I don' t think anyone else around here has had any problems.
I was over at Theo Henry' s farm yesterday afternoon, and he would have mentioned something.
Why were you at Theo' s place?
Some animals around the county have been acting funny -- and some of them violent.
What is it, a virus?
I don' t think so, Father.
They' re more odgy, you know, and alert.
It' s almost like they act when they smell a predator around -- peeing on themselves and everything.
Caroline... please stop calling me "Father."
What' s wrong?
[Sniffles]
He fell on me.
[Alr hisses]
Did he hurt you?
No.
I' m so sorry, Morgan.
Where were you?
Houdini' s sick.
[Gasps]
What' s the matter?
There' s a monster outside my room.
Can I have a glass of water?
What' s wrong with the water next to your bed?
[Sighs softly]
What are you thinking about?
Why do you talk to Mom when you' re by yourself?
Makes me feel better.
Does she ever answer back?
No.
[lnhales sharply]
What?
Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers are back.
It' s time for an ass- whupping.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Lee is a friend of mine.
This is his son.
Yeah, we' il be doing Lee a favor.
All right, listen -- we both go outside, move around the house in opposite directions.
We act crazy, insane with anger -- make them crap in their pants, force them around till we meet up on the other side.
Explain "act crazy."
You know, curse and stuff.
You want me to curse?
It' s just for show.
What?
Well, it won' t be convincing.
It doesn' t sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises, then.
Explain "noises."
Are you gonna do this or what?
No, I' m not.
All right, you want them stealing something in the house next time?
-- All right.
[Door hinges creak]
Aaah!
I' m insane with anger!
[Clattering]
We' re gonna tear your head off!
[Rapid footsteps]
[Both panting]
I cursed.
[Rustling]
How did he get... [Rustling continues]
[Squeaking]
You like that?
You got an old baby monitor around?
Bo had an old baby monitor.
You can use Bo' s baby monitor as a walkie- talkie.
-- Mm- hmm.
[Machinery whirring on television]
Get it off!
Hey, Bo... turn that down till Officer Paski leaves.
[Volume decreases]
You' re too old to still be doing this.
You take a glass of water, and you finish it.
Now, what' s wrong with this one?
It has dust in it.
This one?
A hair.
This one?
My turn.
So, how are you, Merrill?
Fine.
How is work at the gas station??
[Chuckles]
I never got a chance to tell you, but l- I thought your moving in here with your brother after -- it was a nice thing to do.
Well, I don' t think I' m helping much.
You are.
Sorry.
Okay, so far I have, "It was very dark."
Yes, it was.
You can' t describe him at all?
Don' t you think that' s kind of odd?
A little.
I don' t know whether to look for a giant or a midget.
No, he definitely wasn' t a midget.
Okay.
So he was tall?
l- I would say so, yes.
Probably.
Over 6 feet?
It was very dark.
Yes, it was.
How certain are you that this was a male?
Oh, I don' t know -- I don' t know any girls who could run like that.
I don' t know, Merrill.
I' ve seen some of those women on the Olympics.
They can run like the wind.
This guy got on our roof in, like, a second.
O- Our roof is 10 feet high.
They have women' s high jumping in the Olympics.
They got these Scandinavian women who can jump clean over me.
Caroline, I know you' re making a point here, but I just don' t know what it is.
An out- of- town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yolling and cussing because they didn' t have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine.
She scared a couple of the customers.
No one' s seen her since.
[Footsteps approach]
Dad, where' s the remote?
I don' t know, baby.
Why don' t you check in the sofa cushions?
Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else might be a possibility?
I' m not done asking questions, and I don' t appreciate sarcasm.
Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you -- maybe a- a church member who -- who might not have like the fact that you left the church?
I don' t think so.
Okay, I was out of line with the whole female - Scandinavian- Olympian thing. it' s just I' m pretty strong, and I' m pretty fast.
And I was running as fact as I could, and this guy, he was -- he was just toying with us.
There' s only food under the sofa.
Baby, why don' t you just change the channel on the television?
I did.
And?
Same show' s on every station.
Every station??
Bo, turn up the volume.
Crop signs first emerged in the late '70s with renewed interest in extraterrestrial life.
They died out by the early '80s, dismissed as hoaxes.
This now resurgence is wholly different.
[lndistinct conversations]
There are only a limited number of explanations.
-- [lnhales deeply]
Extraterrestrials.
What in God' s name is going on?
I did some research after I saw your crops.
Two or three guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overnight using just boards and ropes.
Really?
That' s how these things have been done in the past.
But there are so many now.
How could so many people be in on it?
I' m -- I' m gonna go back to the station and have a cup of Edgar' s coffee and -- and try to think clear.
I might make some calls.
But I' il tell you something -- what I said in there, it still goes.
Your -- your family has been through a lot.
And the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world.
Now, take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things, hmm?
Good medicine.
That' s good advice.
And you take care of yourself...
[Engine turns over]
The footage you' re watching was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34- year- old local cameraman in Bangalore a southern city of lndia. it' s the 18th reported crop sign found in that country in the last 72 hours.
Uncle Merrill, will you turn on the radio?
They are signs intended to be seen from the sky -- [Radio turns off]
No radio either.
Just for a while.
Book money?
Sure.
Just one.
Bo back for pizza in 15.
It' s just a bunch of crock
They' re trying to sell sodas.
It' s plain and simple
Been watching these reports since morning.
I have seen 12 soda commercials so far -- 12!
You have any books on extraterrestrials?
Now, don' t tell me you believe this horse manure.
As a matter of fact, I think we have one.
Came by mistake in a shipment -- decided to keep it for the city people.
Last row, third book on the left, honey.
Why is no one saying the obvious?
These are just copycats.
Someone somewhere does the first one...
It was asthma medicine, right, Father?
For Morgan Hess.
ln less than an hour, a couple hundred people got the same brilliant idea, and here we are on the verge of mass hysteria.
Can I ask you a favor, Father?
I need to clear my conscience
Will you listen to me?
Tracey... l am not a reverend anymore.
I haven' t been for six months.
You know this.
All this stuff on TV -- two girls came in here talking about the end of the world --
I' m just a little scared
Please, I need to clear my conscience.
I' ve got it figured.
You do?
I' ve had two separate folks tell me there have been strangers around these parts last couple nights.
'cause they' re staying in the shadows -- covertlike.
Nobody' s been hurt, mind you.
And that' s the giveaway.
I see. it' s called "probing." it' s a military procedure
You send out a reconnaissance group -- very small -- to check things out.
Not to engage but to evaluate the situation -- evaluate the level of danger, make sure things are all clear.
Clear for what?
For the rest of them.
Yeah?
You got a pamphlet or something I can read?
Sure.
Thanks.
You didn' t used to play baseball, did ya?
Shit, I know you.
You' re Merrill Hess.
I was there the day you hit that 507- footer over the left- field wall -- set the record.
Man, that thing had a motor on it.
It' s still the record, right?
Got the bat at home o- on the wall.
You' ve got two minor- league home- run records, don' t ya?
Five.
Why weren' t you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting your toes licked by beautiful women?
'Cause he has another record most people don' t know about
He has the minor- league strikeout record
Hello, Lionel.
Merrill' s a class- A screwup.
He would just swing that bat as hard as he could every time.
Didn' t matter what the coaches said, didn' t matter who was on base.
He would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could.
Looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tree.
Merrill here has more strikeouts than any two players.
You really got the strikeout record?
Felt wrong not to swing.
It' s contaminated.
Carl, there' s something wrong with our water.
Your water' s fine.
Bo has this thing about her drinking water.
She had it her whole life.
It' s like a tick people have, except it' s not a tick.
ls that right?
That same old cola
-- Pop pop I wanna... Shasta -- I' il take it.
I cursed 37 times last week
I said the "F" word a couple times, but mostly... "shits" and... "bastards."
ls "douche bag" a curse?
I suppose that would depend on its usage.
How about, "John, you' re a douche bag for kissing Barbara"?
It' s a curse.
It' s 71.
Pharmacy crowded?
I don' t want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone.
[Breathes deeply]
ls that him?
[Car door closes, engine turns over]
[lnsects chirping]
What is it?
Graham: it' s Bo' s baby monitor.
I found it in the basement.
[Droning]
What if it' s catching a signal from them?
It' s not.
But it wasn' t working.
Morgan, this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlfriend in their llves.
They' re, like, 30, and they work up little codes together, and they analyze Greek mythology and make up secret societies where other guys who never had girlfriends before can join in.
They do stupid crap like this to feel special.
It' s a scam.
Nerds were doing it 25 years ago, and now nerds are doing it again.
It' s just static, Morgan, all right.
[Volume increases]
It' s a code.
Why can' t they got girlfriends?
[Static, droning continue]
It' s noise.
It' s broken, Morgan.
It' s just gonna keep doing this.
Maybe some now batteries...
We might lose the signal.
This is exactly what the nerds want.
[Droning continues, volume increases]
Nobody move.
Voices.
Did you hear that?
Not English, though.
You heard the voices, right, Uncle Merrill?
[Droning]
Probably picking up another baby monitor.
[Pitch fluctuates]
[High- pitched droning]
[Volume decreases]
See, this is why we' re not watching TV.
People get obsessed.
I' m letting go now.
No Dad!
Don' t do it!
You' il lose the signal.
Don' t let go.
It gets clearer the higher you hold it.
I got it.
Bo, honey, I don' t want you climbing on the car.
[Panting]
Stop!
[Static]
[Whining continues]
You' re wasting your time here!
I' m not gonna report this or anything you do to my crops to the news or TV or anybody!
[Gasps]
Okay.
[Clicks, television humming]
It first appeared 52 minutes ago.
Mexico City officials as well as U. S. officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either government' s air force
The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlán to New York as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City air space
They were not detected by radar by either country.
-- The nerds were right.
We have to tape this.
My ballet recital.
Listen, Bo, this is very important.
Everything people have written about in science books is going to change.
The history of the world' s future is on the TV right now.
We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there.
For your children, Bo.
My ballet recital.
Dad!
[Siren continues]
Uncle Merrill, I' m using your tape.
You are seeing a live feed from our affiliate down here ln Mexico City.
This image has not been adjusted or enhanced ln any way.
What you' re seeing is real.
It' s unbelievable.
-- Everything they wrote ln science books is about to change.
-- [lnhales deeply]
Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world.
That' s true.
Do you think it could be?
Yes.
How can you say that?
That wasn' t the answer you wanted?
Couldn' t you pretend to be like you used to be?
Give me some comfort.
People break down into two groups when they experience something lucky.
Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence.
They see it as a sign -- evidence that there is someone up there watching out for them.
Group number two sees it as just pure luck, a happy turn of chance.
I' m sure the people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way.
For them, the situation isn' t 50- 50.
Could be bad, could be good.
But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they' re on their own.
And that fills them with fear.
Yeah, there are those people.
But there' s a whole lot of people in the group number one.
When they see those 14 lights, they' re looking at a miracle.
And deep down, they feel that whatever' s going to happen, there' il be someone there to help them.
And that fills them with hope.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind who sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just got lucky?
Or look at the question this way -- is it possible that there are no coincidences?
I was at this party once.
I' m on the couch with Randa McKinney.
looking beautiful, staring at me.
I go to lean in and kiss her... and I realize I have gum in my mouth.
So I turn, take out the gum, stuff it in a paper cup next to the sofa, and turn around.
[Chuckles softly]
I could have been kissing her when she throw up.
That would have scarred me for life.
[Laughs]
I' m a miracle man.
Those lights are a miracle.
There you go.
So, which type are you?
Do you feel comforted
Yeah, I do.
Then what does it matter?
I never told you the last words that Colleen said before they let her die.
She said, "See."
Then her eyes glazed a bit.
And then she said, "Swing away."
You know why she said that?
Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games just popped into her head.
There is no one watching out for us, Merrill.
[Keys jingle, engine turns off]
What do you know?
Well, there was an accident -- drunk driving, they weren' t sure --
Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
-- ls he okay?
-- Yeah.
That was the first thing Colleen asked, too.
She' s talking.
What ambulance is she in?
[Floorboards squeak]
For the kids' protection.
All they were doing was watching TV from 5: 00 a. m.
I felt like they were getting obsessed, like you said.
They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something.
What' s furry, furry rabbit?
It' s a game, isn' t it?
Anyways, they closed the schools.
And there' s been some interesting developments.
What time is it?
11: 00 a. m.
They' re gone, but they' re not really gone.
We just can' t see them.
Early this morning, a bird flow into the area where the lights were hovering last night.
It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down.
They' ve been playing it all morning.
The footag e looks like the bird flow into a wall in the sky.
They found the bird.
His -- his head was crushed in.
They think they have some kind of invisible- shield thing going, l- like an optical illusion.
They' re still there, hovering.
Some people think there' s more of them now...
All over the place, over us, even.
There' s a theory about the c -- the crop circles.
[Wind chimes tinkling]
Want to hear a story?
Is it true?
So the aliens can' t read our minds.
Oh.
Oh, of course.
They tell you everything in this book.
It says they' re probably very small, like my height, because as their brains develop, there was no use for physical development.
It also says they' re probably vegetarians becauso they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
Who wrote this book?
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
That means they' re unemployed.
lf you' re gonna make fun of it, then forget it.
This is serious.
I don' t know what got into me.
There are pictures.
Dr. Bimbu, one of the authors of the book --
-- Bimbu?
-- Dad.
I just asked his name.
You had a tone.
He said there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us -- to make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe, or the other reason -- they' re hostile.
They' ve used up all the resources on their planet, and they' re looking to harvest our planet next.
Here.
Looks a little like our house doesn' t it?
Same windows.
-- [Gasps]
Yeah, oh, yeah.
That' s enough from Dr. Bimbu for now.
[Ringing continues]
Hello?
Father?
Hello?
[Footsteps approach]
I' m going out for a few minutes.
No one leaves this house -- no one.
Where you going?
Ray Reddy' s house.
Why?
[Door opens, slams]
You don' t think something bad will happen, do you, Morgan?
Why?
You have one of your feelings again?
ls it bad?
I won' t let anything bad happen to you.
I don' t want you to die.
Who said I was gonna die?
[lnsects chirping]
Hello, Ray.
What happened?
It' s been sitting next to the phone for 6 months.
I couldn' t thlnk of any other number to call.
I panicked.
Thank you for coming, Father.
You' re welcome, Ray.
I worked so long that night.
I' ve never fallen asleep driving before... never since.
Don' t.
Most of the ride home, there wasn' t a car in sight in either direction.
If I' d have fallen asleep then,
I would have ended up ln a ditch with a headache.
And it had to be at that right moment -- that 10, 15 seconds when I passed her walking.
It was like it was meant to be.
I' m screwed, right?
[Engine turns over]
Wh -- Where are you going, Ray?
To the lake.
The way I see it... these places marked in crops and such -- none of them are really near water.
I don' t think they like water.
Can' t be any worse than here.
Did you see something, Ray?
I know what I' ve done to you.
I made you question your faith.
[Sighs deeply]
All right.
And don' t open my pantry, Father.
[Tires spin]
The startling footage we' re about to show you was photographed by a 42- year- old, Romero Valadarez.
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son' s 7th birthday
In the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil.
It was sent to the local news bureau there and sent to us via satellite just a few minutes ago.
All initial opinions are this is genuine.
[Dog barking]
[Shouting continues]
[Tape rewinds]
Hello?
The police are here.
I am with them.
I am a police officer.
I just want to talk with you.
We know all about the hoax.
We already took some of your friends downtown in a paddy wagon.
Just tell us your name and why you did it, and we' il give you the same deal we gave the others.
[Knife scrapes]
Oh!
Ah!
[Birds chirping]
Their skin changes colors.
That' s why we couldn' t see them that night.
Uh... in this book of yours... did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
Yes.
It said they would probably invade.
They would use ground tactics -- hand- to- hand combat.
'cause they know eventually we would use nuclear weapons.
Then the planet would be useless to them.
How could anyone possibly know that information?? it' s ridiculous.
What else did it say?
They said there are one of two outcomes of an invasion.
One, they fight and are defeated and have to return again with full forces hundreds, maybe even thousands, of years later.
What' s two?
They win.
I' m sorry, what -- what book is this?
[Sighs]
I heard a theory that, uh, they don' t like places near water.
Maybe we' d be safe from them near a lake or something.
Sounds made- up.
I saw one of them at Ray Reddy' s house.
I can' t be sure, but I got the distinct feellng he wanted to harm me.
So... we can choose to believe this lake idea, pack up, and go, or we can stay here, hide inside our home, wait it out.
We might be overreacting, but I' m willing to live with that.
Either way, at least we' il be together.
All those in favor of the lake idea, raise your hand.
Yeah.
All those in favor of home, raise your hand.
Okay.
My vote counts as two.
That' s bullshit!
You' re cheating!
Morgan, calm down.
I got two votes because I represent two parents here.
We don' t know anything yet.
We' il be safe here anyway.
I don' t want to leave home.
This is where we lived with Mom.
That' s got nothing to do with this.
I change my vote.
You can' t change your vote.
All those in favor of home, raise your hand.
This is ridiculous.
[Sighs deeply]
We' re going to board up every window in this house.
How do we know boards will do anything?
[Wind chimes tinkling]
The lnformation we' re receiving comes from our affiliates across the world.
Dad, Uncle Merrill!
Amman joins Nairobi, Beijing, and Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights.
There are lights in over 274 cities.
They think it' il be 400 within the hour.
They' re appearing at or within one mile of crop signs.
They were for navigation.
They made a map.
They' re gonna be within a mile of us.
Dad?
Yes?
They think these are staged immediately preceding an attack maneuver.
I was wrong.
They' re hostile.
It' s like "War of the Worlds."
ln countries throughout the globe [Clears throat]
[lndistinct conversations, bell tolls]
[Machinery clanking, helicopters whirring on TV]
I' m going to got back to the windows.
Hey, you guys okay?
Some guy had a sign saying it was the end of the world.
Don' t worry.
You won' t let anything happen to us, right?
No way.
I wish you were my dad.
What did you say?
Don' t you over say anything like that again.
[Tinkling]
There' s too many windows in the bedrooms.
We don' t have enough boards.
We' il board up the bedroom doors.
Where are we gonna sleep?
ln the family room.
What about lsabel?
We' il tie her up in the garage after dinner.
I' il make some sandwiches.
I want spaghetti.
We' il just eat fast, Bo.
Spaghetti sounds great.
What do you want, Morgan?
Anything?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Now we' re talking.
How about you, Merrill?
Chicken toriyaki.
Good choice.
I' m going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.
Extra bacon.
What' s the matter with everyone?
Maybe we should say a prayer.
No.
Why not?
We' re not saying a prayer.
Bo has a bad feeling.
I had a dream.
We aren' t saying a prayer.
Eat!
I hate you.
That' s fine.
You let Mom die.
Morgan.
I am not wasting one more minute of my life on prayer.
Not one more minute.
[Bo cries]
Now we are going to enjoy this meal.
No one can stop us from enjoying this meal, so enjoy it!
-- Stop crying!
-- Graham...
-- Don' t yell at her!
All right, since you' re all not gonna eat.
[Sniffles]
[Silence]
Graham, hurry.
Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you were born, Bo?
You came out of your mama, and you didn' t even cry.
You just opened your eyes, and you looked around the room at everybody.
Your eyes were so big and gorgeous.
All the ladies in the room just gasped.
I mean, they literally gasped.
And they go, "Oh, she' s like an angel."
And they said, "We' ve never seen a baby so beautiful."
And then... you know what happened?
They put you on the table to clean you up, and you looked up at me and you smiled.
They say babies that young can' t smile.
You smiled.
[lsabel barking in distance]
[Growling]
Should we turn off the lights?
[Wind chimes tinkling]
Dad... [Rapid footsteps]
Do you know what happenod when you were born, Morgan?
You came out, and your mama kept bleeding, so the doctors rushed you out of the room before I even had time to see you.
They' re on the roof.
[Crash]
They' re in the house.
I wanted your mama to see you first because she had dreamed about you her whole life.
Then she got feeling better, they brought you in, and they placed you in her arms, and she looked at you, and you looked at her, and you just stared at each other for the longest time.
And then she said real soft,
You look just how I dreamed. "
The attic door.
Let' s go.
Come on.
We forgot our foil helmets.
Have we got anything to wedge against the door knob?
They' il read our minds
You' re scaring your sister.
[Trilling]
Merrill.
I' m looking!
They' il know our secret thoughts.
I' m not ready.
Merrill!
Got it!
[Coughs]
Where' s Bo?
[Clicks, tuning, static]
What' s happening out there?
I can' t even imagine
I hope they' re doing better than we are.
[Pounding on door]
They' re only making noises.
They' re not trying to get in.
Why would they do that?
[Pounding continues]
They' re distracting us.
From what?
The book says they' re probably very good problem solvers.
[Pounding continues]
Morgan, give me your flashlight.
They used to pour coal down in this basement.
[Pounding continues]
I can feel air.
Me too!
It' s getting stronger.
[Wind whistling]
What?
Hold him!
I got him!
Hold him!
I got him!
[Panting]
We don' t have his medicine.
Don' t be afraid, Morgan.
We' il slow this down together.
Feel my chest.
Feel it moving in and out.
Breathe like me.
Breathe like me.
Come on.
I dreamed this.
Stay with me.
I know it hurts.
Be strong, baby.
It' il pass.
[Wheezing continues]
Don' t do this to me again.
Not again.
I hate you.
[Panting]
The fear is feeding him.
Don' t be afraid of what' s happening.
Believe it' s going to pass Believe it.
Just wait Don' t be afraid
The air is coming.
Believe.
We don' t have to be afraid it' s about to pass
Here it comes Don' t be afraid
[lnhales deeply]
Don' t be afraid, Morgan.
Feel my chest.
Breathe with me.
Together.
The air is going in our lungs.
Together.
We' re the same.
[Exhales deeply]
[Clicks]
Ray' s truck swerved off the road and hit Colleen and then a tree, and she was pinned between the two.
What does that mean -- pinned?
The truck -- the truck has severed most of her lower half.
What did you say?
She won' t be saved.
Her body is pinned in such a way that it' s alive when it shouldn' t be alive, and the truck is holding her together.
And she doesn' t feel much, and she' s -- she' s talking almost like normal, and we didn' t pull the truck out
'cause we -- we wanted you to come down here and be with her as long as she' s awake.
And that won' t be very long.
Now, Father, do you understand what I' ve told you?
Caroline... is this the last time I' m gonna talk with my wife?
[lndistinct radio conversation]
People thlnk they came here to take over the planet
That' s bull.
I don' t thlnk that.
My friend and I saw them.
I found a pack of light bulbs.
They poisoned his family.
They dragged them away.
Nobody helieves it, but they didn' t come here for our planet
This is a raid.
[Static]
We' re lucky as hell they' re leaving here.
They' re leaving?
[Static]
How long have we been sleeping?
12 hours or so [Radio turns off]
He said they had poison gas... they secrete in small amounts.
A lot of people died.
But they' re leaving.
like something scared them off.
They left some of their wounded behlnd.
Why are they going?
People must have figured out a way to beat them.
Everyone has a weakness, right?
You didn' t think we' d make it through the night, did you?
No.
Listen... there' s things I can take and a couple things I can' t.
One of them I can' t take is when my older brother, who' s everything I want to be... starts losing faith in things.
I saw your eyes last night.
I don' t want to ever see your eyes like that again.
Okay?
I' m serious.
[Wheezes]
He' s been like that for a while.
He needs his medicine.
Have they said anything about our area?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared... but who knows for sure?
He' s not strong enough.
lf he has another attack right now --
I know.
[Static]
It' s good enough for me.
[Hinges creak]
Get the syringes as well.
We may need to give him an epinephrine shot.
The atmosphere here is cautiously optimistic
-- People are celebrating.
-- They' re doing this on TV.
There' s a great sense of relief.
-- They' re dancing.
-- Yeah, like this.
As we begin evaluating the loss of life
-- Do you want to see it?
-- We will be left with a lot of questions.
-- I' il bring the TV in here.
-- I see the same expression on every face
We know the battle turned around ln the Middle East.
Three small cities there found a primitive method to defeat them.
[Trilling]
[Wheezing]
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, baby.
I was... just taking a walk before dinner.
You love walks.
It was meant to be.
Does it hurt?
I don' t feel much.
Good.
Tell Morgan... to play games.
It' s okay to be silly.
I will.
Tell Bo to listen to her brother.
He' il always take care of her.
I will.
And tell Graham --
I' m here.
Tell him... see.
Tell him to see.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
[Trilling]
Swing away, Merrill.
Merrill... swing away.
[Growls]
[Wheezing]
[Breathlng heavily]
It can' t be luck.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
No poison got in.
No poison got in.
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.
Don' t touch him.
Give him a minute.
Graham...
Give him a second.
D- Daddy...
Don' t touch him.
Graham...
Don' t... don' t.
Dad?
[Gasps]
[Sobs]
[lnstrumental music playing]
What did we just pass on the road?
- Are you speaking to me?
That' s what your friends call you, isn' t it?
Let' s be friends.
- Why are you letting me live?
- We' re going to take a little journey.
- Beaver never hurt a soul and you killed him.
- Fuck you!
- I know what that expression means.
I' ve studied the foul language section of your memory warehouse.
- Rather distasteful, I must say.
- How about this, Mr. Gray?
Eat shit and die.
Why did you call me Mr. Gray?
Watch out for Ister Gay.
Someone told you about me.
Who told you about me?
If you want to know, why don' t you read my mind?
Surprisingly, you' re able to keep things from me...... I don' t understand it.
Oh, Pete, Jesus!
Motherfucker tried to bite my dick off, Jonesy.
I always thought it would be my ex- wife did that.
Let' s get you to some help.
Can you still see the line, buddy?
- I don' t need the line to get to Gosselin' s.
- No, I know that, but...... if we didn' t want to go to Gosselin' s, how would you get us out to 95?
95?
Who gives a shit?
I' m hurting here, Jonesy.
What' s wrong with you?
- Wait a minute, you' re not...
- Shut up, Pete.
You' re too messed up to know what you' re saying.
Too late for that.
Pete, I need you to get onto the snowmobile right now.
Who the fuck are you?
You sound like one of those James Bonds!
This has to do with the fucking eel, doesn' t it?
You' re not...
I' il get him to help.
Pete, tell him what he wants to know.
Now, Pete, which way to l- 95?
I need to go to Massachusetts.
My, my.
That is a gift.
Who taught you that?
You' re gonna be a big help, Pete.
Climb aboard.
- Show' s over out there, buddy.
Let me in.
- Let me in.
What have you got in that part of your mind, professor?
Your memories are out here in the warehouse, aren' t they?
And who taught Pete that nifty trick?
I' m sure the answers are here.
It' il just take me a while to find them.
- To find them.
- Think about letting me in.
- It' s the polite thing to do.
- Polite thing to do.
Beav!
What is this?
Shit!
Fuck me, Freddy.
So long, Beav.
Love you, man.
We all made them in art.
I finished first, so I made one for you, Duds.
Mine' s deformed.
I couldn' t figure out the string.
- That' s right, my man.
I Duddits.
- Duds will find her.
- How?
- He can do anything.
- She' s from the Retard Academy.
- We' ve gotta save this girl.
- Save this world?
- We' il save the world some other time.
- Ister Gay?
- We need you to solve it.
- Dreamcatcher.
- Not this again.
- Shut up.
- We gotta think of Josie.
Josie, Josie, Josie.
- That' s right.
Can you find Josie?
- This is completely crazy.
- You can say that again.
- I didn' t say anything.
I heard you.
- You said, "This is completely crazy."
I thought it.
Kiss my bender.
We can' t.
Are you sure of that, Beav?
She' s down here for sure!
Josie, you down there?
Fuck me, Freddy, she' s down there.
I can see her in my head.
- Yeah.
- Me too.
Help!
- Help me.
- Hold on, Josie, we' re coming!
Josie, hang in there!
She' s scared enough.
There' s like rat shit in here.
- Hold on to my feet!
Pete, do you see anything?
We got her!
- Here' s Josie.
Blue Boy leader.
How we doing, bucko?
- Right here, boss.
Fast and hard.
- Wouldn' t have it any other way, Blue Boy.
Sir?
I see it.
- Don' t hurt us.
- There is no infection here.
- Whose radio is that?
They' re putting it into our heads.
- There it is, gentlemen.
- Directly into our heads.
This gives you an idea what we' re up against.
If anybody' s thinking, "Those poor, helpless little folk...... all naked and unarmed beside their crashed intergalactic Winnebago...... what kind of a dog, what kind of a monster...... could hear that heartbreak and go in just the same?"
I' m that monster.
- We are helpless.
These mothers are as harmless as a fox in a henhouse.
And I' m here to kick some ass!
Are you with me?
- Yes, boss!
- Roger that, boss.
Right on, boss.
I have a visual.
Damn, look at the size of that.
Blue Boy group, this is Blue Boy leader.
Move to level 4 readiness.
Gentlemen, lock and load.
Hellfires are hot.
Blue Boy group, this is Blue Boy leader.
- Fire!
Owen, get them out of there!
It' s gonna blow!
Blue Boy group, withdraw at once.
I repeat, cease firing and back off!
- We can get them!
Back off!
- Blue Boy group, get out of there!
- We' re on top of it!
Owen, pull out now!
- Pull out!
Get out of there!
- Pull out!
Our Scooby- Doo buddy.
For a long time I thought he was sent to us to warn us about something.
- I could never figure what it was.
Not till today.
- He wanted to warn us.
- Go ahead, Pete.
Tell me about your friend.
- No.
- Come on, Pete.
- Bite my bag, motherfucker!
All right, Pete, I' il bite.
Your bag and everything else.
You bastard!
Get out of there!
- What' s up?
- Thank God you came by, governor.
I' m broke down here and fearing for my life.
That' s a good- looking dog.
- Where you headed?
- Gosselin' s.
That' s where I' m going.
Well, I believe your tailgate has come open.
Let' s take a look.
I see you have some cargo you' re taking to Blue Base.
Got a treat for you, Ike.
All you can eat.
Eat all the red stuff.
Yes.
Have your fill.
Tasty, tasty.
Eat all you want...
What are you up to?
You cannot leave the quarantine zone!
- Halt!
- I think I just about halted here.
Come with me, Owen.
I' il show you things you' il wish you' d never seen.
- It' il be all right.
- There must be something they can do.
- Within hours.
- I told you to stay over there!
Please don' t worry.
We' re doing everything to make sure you' re safe.
We' il get you back to your homes within hours.
All clear.
Can I help you, sir?
What' s your name?
- Henry.
Dr. Henry Devlin.
We need doctors in there.
Come on, laddie, I' il buy you a cup.
- You, sir, where you from?
- Boston.
Great city.
We' il have you back there in no time.
Maybe by morning.
Hurry up, bucko.
You see that crud on the faces of children...... you know why I relish a turn in the country like we had today.
You were excellent out there, O.
It made me feel very proud to...
Abe?
Abe, you okay?
I' m fine.
I must be getting too old for this shit.
I don' t know what the hell that was about.
It' s the only way, Owen.
We' ve got to cauterize the site.
It' s the only way.
But we don' t know that.
The studies point to the strong possibility of recovery for many exposed subjects.
The studies show squat, that' s what they show.
If Matheson had been in my spot for the last quarter- century...... you' d have never made it to your first jerk- off.
Some get better.
At least half will be over it in a few days... which ones, Mother Teresa?
Can you guarantee they won' t take it home like a present for the family?
I' il tell you what you should be worried about.
What should be on your mind.
Not these few unfortunates.
What you should be worried about is a hitchhiker.
- What?
- A hitchhiker.
Our greatest fear is that a grayboy would catch a ride...... with somebody and would carry them out of here, without being consumed.
To scatter the infection, like Johnny- fucking- Appleseed.
- Are you sure there isn' t such a person?
- No.
But I am sure that if there is one he won' t get out.
Not with the net my boys put up around the Blue Zone.
Capisce?
Owen, if you think this is easy for me, you' re crazier than my mother was.
They drive Chevrolets, shop at Wal- Mart...... never miss an episode of Friends.
These are Americans.
The idea of slaughtering Americans...... it just turns my stomach.
But I' il do it.
I' il do it because it needs to be done.
So if we start at 2, we can be done by 2: 30.
And it' s all behind us.
Except for the dreams.
Yeah, except for them.
What are you gonna tell Rita about what you did here?
What are you gonna tell Katrina when she' s old enough to ask?
You know me, don' t you?
I don' t remember when we met, but you know me.
You' ve got two problems.
- One you know about, one you don' t.
- Go ahead.
Your mentor, colonel Curtis, he' s gone insane from hunting aliens for 25 years.
Now he wants you to help him kill hundreds of innocent people.
- Who are you?
Talk about that later, once we get out of here.
You won' t let me burn on this fence...... any more than you' il help Curtis kill those people.
What you' re thinking now is whether that digital sat- scan transmitter...... in your duffle bag will let you get through to somebody.
Somebody named General Matheson.
"Sometimes we have to kill, but our real job is to save lives."
Your father was a great soldier.
Those were his last words.
You carry his picture with you always.
Tell me everything.
When we' re done talking, get on the transmitter, contact Matheson.
That takes care of problem number one.
Now comes the hard part.
You think the infection' s been contained, that there' s no hitchhiker.
You' re wrong.
He' s riding with my best friend on Earth.
A guy named Gary Jones.
And he' s out there.
You and I don' t get after him right away, he' il get out of my range...... and some kind of shit is gonna hit the planetary fan.
Our nightmare hitchhiker.
And all Dr. Mystery wants is a free pass so he can catch his friend.
- Very convenient.
Okay.
Where is he?
Okay.
I' il check him out and we can compare notes.
Whatever you say, boss.
Time' s a- wasting.
All right, lad, open up.
Are you in here?
Where I' ve been put.
A prisoner on my own damn property.
Come on, let' s go.
Get in!
You almost ran me down.
Figured you' d read my mind and get out of the way.
Put down your weapons at once.
This is no longer a Blue Unit operation.
Put down your arms.
General Matheson has assumed command.
You just drove over the Curtis line.
- Where we going?
All I know right now.
Just get me in range of Jonesy...... we' il know everything we need to know.
That' s some gun.
Can I have a look?
- Kind of flashy for a guy like you, isn' t it?
- It' s a gift.
I know.
Where are you, Jonesy?
Call 1- 800- HENRY.
Hello?
Jesus Christ, I knew it was you.
Where' s he taking you?
Massachusetts?
He is?
Duddits?
Jonesy?
He hung up.
Give me back my gun.
- That where they' re going?
No, they' re going towards Massachusetts.
Jonesy says Mr. Gray is afraid of Duddits.
Your buddy, he' s still alive after all this time with Mr. Gray?
I think it' s because he died.
He got hit by a car and his heart stopped.
I don' t think he even knows it.
Must have changed him somehow.
It' s almost like Duddits saw this whole thing coming.
Jonesy told me it was Duddits who drew him into the accident.
If we catch him, we' re gonna have to kill him.
You know we have to do it.
It' s the only way to stop Mr. Gray...... assuming we can catch him.
When was the last time you saw Duddits?
Long time ago.
Years.
What makes you so sure he can help?
Duddits can do anything.
I didn' t understand that then, but I think it' s always been true.
He' s the one who made us like this.
- Like what?
- You know, weird.
He' s been waiting for you.
I miss you, Henny.
I miss you.
Long time, Henny.
- My God, Roberta, what is it?
- Lymphocytic leukemia.
I' m gonna let you take him, but I have to tell you why.
Just now, when he was getting ready...... Henry he was so excited.
Like he hasn' t been in such a long time.
I think...... that if he' s with you, he might die happy...... instead of in this awful room.
Cold devastates him.
The medication and instructions are in here.
Bye, Mom.
Goodbye, Duddie.
Be a good boy.
Now, go save the world.
Not yet, anyway.
What' ve we got?
Toward Massachusetts.
Massachusetts?
Stay with it, bucko.
General Matheson.
Come in, please.
This is very nice, Abe.
Been home through some rough times.
Was there something we hadn' t covered?
I don' t think I got to say before how much I respect the work you' ve done.
It was with sincere regret...
Herman...
May I call you Herman?
We may not agree on all the strategic initiatives, but we do agree on this:
Burned out.
Just needed a push, that' s all.
Should have quit after that mess in Montana.
Even I don' t trust my judgment anymore.
My techies tell me we' re getting some electronics reading hot from in here.
Yes, I' ve been talking to the wife on my sat phone.
I don' t know if you' ve ever met Barbara.
She' s very happy, I can tell you that.
I' il have everything shut down in an hour.
If that' s soon enough.
That will be fine.
How do you turn off the goddamn lights?
Maybe you shouldn' t have been so fast to kill that trooper.
You' re making yourself at home.
Tell me how you like this:
"Maybe you shouldn' t have been so fast to kill that trooper." Not bad?
Ownzy.
He' s in a police car now.
He' s in a police car now.
Can you see where they are, Duds?
He' s in Ister Gay.
Mr. Gray.
That' s right, Duds, he is in Mr. Gray.
"Ister Gay" is Mr. Gray.
We gotta save this girl.
Save the world?
Not the world, Duds, a girl.
We' il save the world some other time.
Ister Gay?
You already knew.
Where' s he going, Duds?
Where is Mr. Gray taking Jonesy?
Ister Gay, he want war.
- War?
- Not war, water.
Mr. Gray wants water.
I know where he' s going.
- He' s going to the Quabbin Reservoir.
- What' s Quabbin?
It supplies drinking water for all of Boston.
What?
One worm kills the world.
One worm kills the world?
Oh, my God.
Back at our cabin, I saw the worms that come out of these weasels.
Mr. Gray must want to get one into the Boston drinking supply.
- Are we going right?
- Yes.
It' s not far.
You' re doing great, buddy.
I want to ask you something hard.
Yes, Henny.
Good.
Can you talk to Jonesy?
Can you make him hear you?
Ownzy...... and Ister Gay.
I knew it.
He' s been here all along.
Jonesy?
We owe it to our friend, Duddits.
- I don' t know what you mean.
- No?
Maybe your clever friend didn' t want you to know what he was up to.
That' s why you had nothing in the warehouse about me.
Duddits didn' t bother to tell you what job he had in mind for you.
It doesn' t matter.
Did it, Ike?
We' re almost there.
I have promises to keep And miles to go before I sleep
And miles to go before I sleep
Stop that chopper!
Don' t be a pussy.
Thank you, Gary Jones.
Aqueduct to Boston starts in Shaft 12.
Patience, bambino.
Stay here and take care of your friend.
No matter what you hear.
So long, doctor.
Good doggy.
Good girl.
Shit!
You son of a bitch!
Wait.
Go back to car, Duddie.
You' il be safer there.
Look out, Jonesy.
I knew you' d come, Henry.
I knew you wouldn' t let me die.
Who the fuck are you?
- Don' t you know me, H?
- I don' t know.
Just to be sure.
Well, maybe you' re right, my friend.
I don' t know myself if Mr. Gray is gone.
He could be hiding in here somewhere...... waiting for his chance.
Tell me something Mr. Gray couldn' t possibly know.
Tell me something only we would know.
SSDD.
Not good enough.
Ask me anything.
At Tracker Brothers, day we met Duddits...... what was painted on the wall by the window?
... bounce...
No play.
Hello...... Ister Gay.
Ooby- Ooby- Doo...... we got some work to do now.
Ister Gay...... go away.
No!
I Duddits.
Jonesy.
Jonesy, if that really is your name...
- That' il be 50 small.
- Bullshit.
- I Duddits.
- I Duddits.
They' re my friends.
We' re all best friends.
Here' s to Duddits, our dreamcatcher.
- Beginners, please!
- Your five- minute call, sir.
Sh.
Quiet, everyone.
Good to see you.
- Sir Herbert, how are you?
- This is my wife.
- How do you do?
One of Mr Barrie' s finest?
It' s the best thing I' ve produced in 25 years.
See you on Broadway!
If you could take your opening positions, please.
Beginners, please take your opening positions.
Audience are coming in.
- Good audience.
- Sorry?
Good audience tonight.
That' s great, thank you.
How much longer?
I love opening nights.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Good evening, Mr Frohman.
- How are you, John?
- Very well.
- Hello, George.
How are you?
You' ve rearranged a holiday for me and I won' t forget it.
- You won' t regret it.
- There' s Mrs Barrie.
- Oh, Mr and Mrs Snow.
You were so wonderful.
Are you right to find your seat?
Oh, yes, yes.
Excuse me.
- Yes, ma' am.
- Thank you.
Really, I mustn' t inconvenience you in this way.
I can wait quite well in the shop.
Really, you are uncommonly good.
Sorry, sir.
Mrs Barrie wanted me to remind you that the play' s begun.
- They hate it.
- Sir?
- I wouldn' t say they hate it, sir.
- What do you think?
- I' ve just been hired here, sir.
I' m not bothered.
- I' m not really qualified to...
- Do you like it?
- Crap, sir?
Just say it.
It' s shite, isn' t it?
Say it.
- "It' s bull' s pizzle, Mr Barrie." Go on, say it.
Thank you.
Might I knock a tune, milord, for a moment?
Yes, I found it fearfully dull.
Good to see you.
My apologies.
- Of course we will, James.
- I know you put a lot into this one.
How are you?
We were beginning to wonder which is your hobby, writing or cricket.
I don' t see why not.
- James.
- Hello, darling.
- Mrs Snow.
- Mr Barrie.
Mr Snow.
- Oh, yes.
- Is that right?
Was it?
Well, thank you.
That' s very kind of you.
I' m glad you liked it.
- Really?
- Mary?
Hello?
- Yes, James?
I' m headed off for the park if you' d like to join me.
It' s a beautiful morning.
You' il be working, won' t you?
Perhaps, yes.
I' il let you to your work then.
- Morning, Mr Barrie.
- Morning, Emma.
- Have a good day, sir.
That' s it.
Go on, boy.
That' s right.
Good boy.
Grab it.
Good.
Who do you belong to?
Come on.
Am I?
So sorry.
I have to, I' m afraid.
Well, if you' re trapped in the dungeon, there isn' t much to be done now, is there?
I wouldn' t risk it, sir.
Is he bothering you, sir?
Aha, Prince George, I gather.
I understand you are the horrible tyrant who imprisoned this unfortunate wretch.
I' m not horrible really, but a firm ruler, yes.
Kind and tolerant.
And what precisely is...
What did you say your name was?
- What precisely is Michael' s crime?
- Fair enough.
Sorry, lad.
- Do you mind us playing with your dog?
- No.
Go on.
He' s only five.
- I' m so sorry.
Are my boys bothering you?
- We' re not bothering him, Mum.
I can' t.
Oh, I see.
Pleased to meet you.
A pleasure.
Sylvia Llewelyn Davies.
- Are you a writer?
He' s a playwright, Jack.
Quite a famous one, at that.
- I apologize.
I imagine you' re writing.
Not at all.
- Where' s Peter?
- What have you written, Mr Barrie?
Well, currently, I make my living entertaining princes and their courts with my trained bear, Porthos.
If you command your brother, Peter, to join us,
Now...
- Peter.
It' s just a dog.
Come on, darling.
"Just"?
Porthos, don' t listen to him.
What a horrible, candle- snuffing word.
Peter, where are your manners?
However, with just a wee bit of imagination,
We' re here every day, and the bear is always more than happy to perform.
Well, perhaps we' il see you here tomorrow then.
Perhaps.
- Peter, jump up please, darling.
- Peter, didn' t you enjoy that?
I do very much hope to see them tomorrow.
- What' s her name?
Mrs... something Davies.
Llewelyn Davies?
- You know her?
Her father was the artist.
He died.
James.
Absolutely.
Why, she knows practically everyone there is worth knowing.
- What are you writing about?
I can' t write.
Have you ever kept a journal?
Ever tried your hand at writing a play?
I know.
Home.
One afternoon.
Peter.
Why didn' t you tell me, Charles?
Why didn' t you tell me.
James?
Hm?
- Won' t you?
They changed it.
- The critics.
Bang, bang, bang!
Return the boy to us, you nasty lnjun.
Our chief, Running Nose, never let him go.
Bang, bang, bang!
Me wounded, Peter.
Time' s short.
You go.
Fly back to our chief.
Tell her of my brave defeat.
That' s crazy.
Of course they can.
This lnjun kidnapped you.
We kidnap no one.
I take you as my own son.
- Let me go!
- Stop it, you two.
- Ooh, we are awful, aren' t we?
- Oh, I' m scared.
Of course, you had a bit of fun for a change.
- Stop it, you two.
- Don' t.
- Stop it!
- Get off, George!
- Peter.
- I' m terribly sorry.
- No, it wasn' t your fault.
I' m afraid it might have been.
To be honest, I' m just happy you got him to join in the game.
Oh, yes, I was a tremendous success.
Mr Barrie, it' s more than I' ve been able to achieve.
Peter' s a different boy since his father died.
You know, I don' t think he' s even had a good cry about it.
Yes, it does.
Your mother as well.
Oh.
How kind.
That would be lovely.
And, Mrs du Maurier, what a shame it is that we' ve not met until this evening.
How kind of you to say so.
Not at all.
My problem is in finding the time to do everything else.
At the moment I am running two households.
Sylvia believes she can get by without a housekeeper.
Mother.
My house is quite large enough for us all,
- but the idea of living with me seems...
- Not now, please, mother.
- Don' t interrupt, George.
- Where did you get your manners?
- Sorry, Grandmother.
- Oh, they indulge me, really.
But Mr Barrie was taken ill by the bite of a...
What was it?
Tsetse fly.
Quite horrible.
Yes, and he swelled to the size of a hippopotamus.
Fingers like sausages.
But the fishing was good, wasn' t it?
James.
- Bye.
- Thank you so much.
- Lovely evening.
Bye.
- Good night.
Well, that was a disaster.
Painful.
"My problem is in finding the time to do everything else."
- Judged?
How do you mean?
I just enjoy their company.
Yes.
Go on, boy.
- George, stop!
I want to do it.
Oh, wait.
- Here.
- That' s a good idea.
- I want to do it.
- Porthos!
- Yeah?
- Now, would you like to give it a go?
- Yes, please.
- Of course he can.
George.
Come on, Peter.
Right, George, hold it up.
- Run!
Run, Michael!
- Run!
Oh.
Right.
Are you ready, Michael?
- You can do it, Michael.
Run, Michael, run.
- Run!
What are you writing about now?
Oh, just making notes.
Now, why do you ask that?
Perhaps you should then.
That' s a fantastic idea.
Why not give it a try?
Talking a bit of silliness really.
Can we have him for supper?
You are welcome, you know.
Mr Barrie.
Where have you been?
I' m sorry.
Well, apparently you forgot then.
You don' t need to wait till the cupboard is bare.
Come on, darlings.
Wipe feet.
- And... coat hanger.
Good.
- Will we see you tomorrow?
Thank you for a lovely day, James.
Excuse me, Mother.
So from tomorrow, we' re going to have some discipline around here.
And not one of you will escape.
- Good evening, Mr Barrie.
- Good evening, Mr Barrie.
You missed supper.
I have a bit of writing I wanted to do.
It was a lovely meal.
Sarah let Emma cook this evening.
Is that right?
That' s very charitable of you.
And what about linen?
Please, Mary, stop.
My husband, for example.
We rarely see him in this house.
That scepter' s made of wood.
The means to an end, Peter.
- There you go.
- What' s this?
Open it.
"The Boy Castaways."
Stab him, George.
I still have no idea what to write.
Write about your family.
- What whale?
- A play indeed, yes.
Say yes.
Porthos!
Let go.
I won' t, I won' t.
You should have been in bed half an hour ago, young man.
And then, before you know it, they' re grown.
Their father would have been horrified.
Right!
Your poor mother.
Aye.
She wouldn' t eat.
I tried everything to make her happy, but... she only wanted David.
So... one day...
I dressed myself in David' s clothing and I went to her.
You must have frightened her to death.
Neverland.
Ever.
Wait a minute, James.
Er, no.
He' s the irrepressible spirit of youth.
- Tinker Bell is a woman?
- She' s not a woman.
She' s a fairy.
It doesn' t work.
James, I' m your friend.
- That' s a lot of water.
- It' s a lot of water.
- Yes, and that' s a lot of money.
- It is, but we can fake the water.
You know what I think I' il do?
Long enough and hard enough?
That' s it.
- Ah, of course he does.
Out!
- Well done.
- Good show!
It' s perfect actually.
Spend a good deal of time with them, don' t you?
You should be aware though, James, what some people have been saying.
Mind you, I wouldn' t bring it up if I thought the rumors would pass.
Very well.
And...
That' s it.
Nothing more.
That' s outrageous.
How could anyone think something so evil?
They' re innocent children.
No.
Then why is no one sitting with them?
Once you get a bit of notoriety, James, people watch you and they will look for ways to drag you down.
Are you sure your wife doesn' t object to us taking over your cottage for the summer, James?
- She doesn' t go there anymore.
It' s such a relief to get away.
Are we in?
- Can I drive, Uncle Jim?
- Er, no.
Get the sheep out the way.
- Are we there yet?
I can see the cottage!
- Don' t tear your clothes, please.
Follow me.
Hurry up, everyone.
- Mm.
Yes.
'Ello!
Off to the ship, son!
- How marvelous.
- Excellent work, matey.
Now is your only chance to speak.
- Not finished yet.
Giggling?
- I said I' m ready, Captain.
- What' s your name, boy?
I' m Curly, the oldest and wisest of the crew.
Welcome aboard, Curly.
And who be you, young squire?
My name be Nibs the Cut- throat.
Jack!
Welcome aboard, Nibs.
You shall polish all wood surfaces.
Grab a hold of that rigging.
- And you, lad?
- I' m Peter.
What about Dastardly Jim, eh?
I like my name.
- What are you playing again?
- The boy.
Excuse me.
Mr Barrie, sir?
There' s been a mistake here, sir.
- What?
Rrr.
Oh, right.
Actually, we don' t have a Tinker Bell cast, do we?
Heavens, no.
Just a wee light that moves around the stage.
Bit worried about this.
Let' s see.
It' s a play for puppets.
Tootles, Nibs, Curly.
All these names are absurd when you see them all together.
Captain Hook, S...
You' re out of your mind.
How were rehearsals?
Fine.
Great.
- Yes.
- How was your journey?
- It was quite long.
Thanks.
- In a moment, Michael.
But I said I' d get him.
They always send Peter to do things.
I said I' il do it.
- It will spoil the surprise.
- What surprise, darling?
- It' s a play?
"A play in one act by Peter Llewelyn Davies."
- I should hope so.
Go on.
Well, let' s see it then.
- Go on, Peter.
Sylvia.
- Do you want some water?
- No, James.
Go on.
She won' t discuss it with me at all.
She claims it was nothing.
- I' il try and do my best.
Just there.
Then...
Like that.
Come in.
The good doctor didn' t feel up to the challenge on this one.
He thinks you need to go to hospital for further tests.
Nonsense.
No, James.
I' ve no interest in hospitals.
"It' s only a chest cold"?
- Stop lying to me!
I' m sick of grown- ups lying to me.
I won' t be made a fool.
What' s this?
Peter.
The play.
Darling, I wanted to see the rest of it.
James.
Well, you remember Gilbert Cannan, don' t you?
It' s been a long evening, Mary.
Yes.
I should perhaps talk to you at another time?
Not so late?
That will be fine.
We' il talk then.
Thank you for your patience, Mrs Barrie.
Mr Barrie.
- Good night.
- Night.
What would you like me to say?
"Curious how late Mr Cannan stayed," I suppose.
What comes next?
"No later than you were out, James."
"And how is Mrs Davies this evening?"
Oh, yes, I would have a great answer for that one, wouldn' t I?
I know that, Mary.
But I' m not ready for this conversation, wherever it may lead.
Perhaps we can talk in the morning, yes?
Good night then.
Mr Barrie.
No, in fact I think it' s quite... baggy.
- Baggy?
That' s very tight.
- Plank of wood?
- Otherwise, it' s marvelous.
- Right, sir.
- You' il be sick tomorrow.
James.
We' re just having some tea.
Yes.
How do you do?
- May I take your hat?
- That' s enough, boys.
Boys, please don' t run in the house.
You' il break something.
Come on, come on.
- I' d like a word with you, Mr Barrie, before you go.
We' il only be a few minutes.
Boys, why don' t you go and play in the garden?
- Is he in trouble?
Because I' ve been alone with Grandmother and I know what it' s like.
- Why don' t you join them, dear?
- I do apologize for interrupting.
- Would you close the door, please?
Certainly.
- Well, not exactly.
You' il leave that to me, Mr Barrie.
- You' re moving in?
- I' m going where I' m most needed.
It isn' t charity, Mrs du Maurier.
Have you no idea how much your friendship has already cost my daughter?
Or are you really that selfish?
I beg your pardon?
Sylvia needs to find someone.
The boys need a father.
I' il look after them.
What are you suggesting?
That is precisely what I am doing.
I was so certain what I would find in this.
I don' t write love notes in my journal.
No.
Still, you knew who I meant, didn' t you?
That' s some comfort, actually.
It means I know you just a little after all.
No.
I suppose I could just go see the plays.
And I hoped, at least once... you would take me there with you.
There is no such place.
Yes, there is.
Neverland.
It' s the best you' ve written, James.
Mary.
- What was I supposed to do, James?
I was right here.
Sitting in your parlor, staring off into other worlds as though I didn' t exist.
Look.
No, I' m tired of waiting, James.
Of course not.
Rehearse and be home for dinner.
And I will.
Nanny.
What?
The pajamas you get with your teeth.
Because in fact, being a dog, you haven' t any proper digits, have you?
We' il get you teeth.
- Let' s have a wee break, shall we?
- I thought you were wonderful.
- I do.
- Well, you picture it, James.
They' ve paid good money, they' re expecting theater, what we call theater.
But you did know, Charles.
You' re an absolute genius, Charles.
Listen, listen.
- Set aside?
25?
Two here, two there, three up there.
- Are they paying for it?
- Uncle Jim?
- Hello, boys.
Could I speak to you for a moment, please?
25 seats, Charles.
25 scattered seats?
Throughout the theater.
Whoa.
This is great.
We don' t need to use much pull at all, see?
I' m not a fool, Uncle James.
It could be.
I' ve tried.
Apparently I' ve made quite a mess of things.
It' s Grandmother, isn' t it?
She' s run you off, hasn' t she?
Oh, she' s absolutely tried with great effort.
And perhaps with good reason.
It isn' t you, Uncle Jim.
Look at that.
How magnificent.
Right then.
I think you should be the one to talk to her, George.
Sorry to interrupt.
- What' s happened?
It' s not possible, too tight.
George, give me a minute, I' il be back.
OK.
- Whoa!
- Yeah, you can have a little go if you want.
Go on.
- Can I have a go?
- In a minute.
In a minute.
- Jack.
- No, Michael.
Come on now.
Ow!
Oh, no.
- I' m so sorry.
- George?
Mr Barrie?
No, just Mr Barrie.
- Encourage what?
You know perfectly well what.
This is absurd.
So you' ve already spoken to a doctor then?
I' il have the examination, and I' il take whatever medications they advise.
But I don' t want to know what they' re for.
Mary?
Mary?
Peter, could you help George to fold a pocket handkerchief, please?
- They' re in the linen cupboard.
Darling?
- Yes, Mother.
Jack, how do you manage to always come untucked?
Would you check your shirt- tails in the intermission, please?
Yes, Mother.
You' re not planning on attending any after- theater events, are you?
- With the children?
Um, possibly.
Would you see if George has the tickets, please?
- Sylvia, there' s a...
Mother, please see if George has the tickets.
Michael, where are your socks?
Wait here, don' t move.
Take her feet, George.
Sh, Michael.
- No, sir.
Not yet.
Precisely.
- Charles.
I suggest you start selling them.
The 25 seats, are they filled?
Yes.
Who did you invite?
- Yes.
You' ve been promising me all...
- Charles?
No, sir.
I don' t need a doctor.
Can I do anything, Mother?
No, darling.
You must go to the play.
- I can' t do that.
- Yes, you can.
Please.
It' s only a play, Mother.
What do you want?
Last call, please, ladies and gentlemen.
Last call.
Yes, yes, yes.
They know.
We had time to sell those 25 seats.
- Charles.
- What?
- They' re here.
- Who' s here?
- Mm.
Right.
Excuse me, sir.
Thank you.
Looks like we got one of the better- dressed ones.
I just want you to know, I think you' re a wonderful dog.
Thanks.
I won' t.
Nana, it isn' t six o' clock yet.
Please.
One minute more.
Nana, I will not be bathed.
I tell you, I will not be bathed.
No one there.
Yet I feel sure I saw a face.
My children.
- How is she?
- May I see her?
- No, Mr Barrie.
- But she' d want to see him.
But you can' t...
- Go upstairs, George, now.
- Stop ordering me about.
This isn' t your home.
It' s our home.
- Mother?
- Yes, darling?
James.
No.
Your play.
Look at all this.
I' d have come tonight, it' s just...
This needs mending.
Four boys, no end of patches.
Can' t seem to keep up.
Don' t look at me like that, James.
Boys, would you give me a moment with your mother, please?
Thank you.
They can see it, you know.
You can' t go on just pretending.
"Just pretending"?
A lot of things, Sylvia, not everything.
We' ve pretended for some time now that you' re a part of this family, haven' t we?
You' ve come to mean so much to us all that now it doesn' t matter if it' s true.
And even if it isn' t true, even if that can never be...
I need to go on pretending.
- Oh, I am sweet.
You just think lovely, wonderful thoughts and they lift you up in the air.
You are so nippy at it.
Couldn' t you do it very slowly once?
Now try.
- I flew!
- Look at me!
- Bravo!
- Let' s go out.
Genius.
- I feel a little better.
- It' s been a bad day, that' s all.
Find Peter.
- Thank you.
Aye.
It' s a bit late for it tonight though, I' m afraid.
Perhaps some time soon though?
Most definitely.
You remember.
- The kite.
- Both of us.
It can' t lift two.
Michael and Curly tried.
I won' t go without you, Peter.
Never.
Ready, Wendy?
Don' t let go, Wendy.
Peter, I' m frightened.
Hang on, Wendy!
Peter!
How are you?
Goodbye.
- Mr Barrie.
Thank you.
Very kind of you to say.
Thank you.
To the very end.
I' m doing well enough now, thank you.
Time is chasing after all of us.
- Aunt Rose, your drink.
You' ve a lot of friends here.
Well, it' s lovely to see you.
I' m terribly sorry, once again.
Well done, Mr Barrie.
- Well done.
Psst.
- It is.
- About all of us.
- That' s right.
Did you like it?
It' s magical.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, Peter.
- This is Peter Pan!
How wonderful.
- Really?
You' re Peter Pan?
Look, it' s true.
He has no shadow.
But I' m not Peter Pan.
He is.
No.
Dr Brighton.
May I have a word?
Excuse me a moment.
You haven' t been keeping him from me, have you?
As a matter of fact, I actually hoped he might come.
Would have proved me wrong about him.
- It' s a secret.
- Quiet, Michael.
Mother, could you come downstairs for a moment?
Oh, she can' t come downstairs.
What are you thinking of, George?
Actually, I think a trip downstairs might do her good, ma' am.
- Just wait and see.
It' s a play.
It' s not just a play, Michael.
It' s the play.
I won' t.
I won' t.
Nana, it isn' t six o' clock yet.
Please.
- You know fairies, Peter?
But they' re nearly all dead now.
And now when every new baby is born, its first laugh becomes a fairy.
So there ought to be one fairy for every boy and girl.
- Ought to be? lsn' t there?
Children know such a lot now.
And every time a child says, "I don' t believe in fairies," there' s a fairy somewhere that falls down dead.
Who is that?
I' il rescue her.
Oh, that' s just my medicine.
Poisoned?
Why, Tink.
Are you dying?
If it goes out, that means she' s dead.
Her voice is so low I can scarcely hear what she' s saying.
She says she thinks she could get well again if children believed in fairies.
If you believe, clap your hands.
Clap louder.
Thank you.
So many perfect days.
I really began to believe we' d go on like that forever.
She wasn' t going to stay with you forever.
My father.
I' m not trying to replace your father, Peter.
I could never do that.
You' d best let him go.
Go on, dear.
I' m terribly sorry.
No, Mr Barrie.
Is that so?
You, Mr Barrie, and myself.
Sit down, Peter.
Listen.
For good.
Don' t worry.
It' s just...
I thought she' d always be here.
So did I.
Always.
I don' t know, boy.
She went to Neverland.
By believing, Peter.
Just believe.
I can see her.
[Man]
Random thoughts for Valentine' s Day, 2004.
Todayis a holidayinvented bygreeting card companies... [Man On P. A. Continues]
Last call -- to make people feel like crap.
I ditched work today.
Took a train out to Montauk.
I don' t know why.
I' m not an impulsive person.
I guess Ijust woke up in a funk this morning.
I gotta get my car fixed.
Hi.
Cindy?
It' s Joel. Joel!
Listen, I don' t feel verywell today.
It' s goddamn freezing on this beach.
Montauk in February.
Brilliant, Joel.
Page is ripped out.
Don' t remember doing that.
It appears this is my first entry in two years.
Sand is overrated.
It' sjust tiny little rocks.
Ifonly I could meet someone new.
I guess my chances ofthat happening are somewhat diminished, seeing that I' m incapable ofmaking eye contact with a woman I don' t know.
Maybe I should get back together with Naomi.
Nice is good.
She loved me.
Why do I fall in love with every woman I see... who shows me the least bit ofattention?
Hi.
I 'm sorry?
- I just said hi.
- Hi.
Okay if I sit closer?
How far are you going?
Uh, Rockville Center.
Get out!
Me too!
Really?
Do I knowyou?
Doyou ever shop at Barnes & Noble?
Sure.
That' s it!
Yeah?
I' ve seen you, man!
Book slave there for, like, fiveyears now.
I would have thought I would' ve remembered you.
Jesus!
Is it fiveyears?
It might be the hair.
The color.
That' s whyyou might not recognize me.
It' s called Blue Ruin, the color.
Yeah.
Snappy name, huh?
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names.
Red -- Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.
That' d be a job, coming upwith those names.
You think there could possibly be a job like that?
I mean, how many hair colors could there be?
Someone' s got thatjob.
Agent Orange!
I apply my personality in a paste.
Oh, I doubt thatvery much.
Well, you don' t know me, so... you don' t know, doyou?
Sorry.
I was just -- I' m trying to be nice.
Yeah.
I got it.
My name' s Clementine, bytheway.
I' m Joel.
Hi, Joel.
Nojokes about my name.
Oh, no, you wouldn' t do that.
You' re trying to be nice.
I don' t know anyjokes aboutyour name.
Huckleberry Hound.
I don' t knowwhat that means.
What areyou, nuts?
It' s been suggested.
[Chuckles]
* Oh, my darlin ', oh, my darlin' Oh, my darlin 'Clementine *
* You were lost and gone forever *
* Dreadful sorry Clementine **
[Laughing]
No?
I' m sorry. Just -- It' s a pretty name, though.
It really is nice.
It' s, uh -- It means "merciful."
Clemency?
Although it hardly fits.
I' m a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Gee, I- I wouldn' t thinkthat aboutyou.
Whywouldn' tyou thinkthat about me?
I just, uh --
Oh, now I' m nice?
Oh, God.
Don' tyou know any other adjectives?
I don' t need "nice."
I don' t need myselfto be it, and I don' t need anybody else to be it at me.
Joel?
It' s Joel, right?
I' m sorry I yelled atyou.
I' m a little out ofsorts today.
I really like thatyou' re nice right now.
I mean, I can' t tell from one moment to the next what I' m gonna like, but right now...
I' m glad you are.
I have so much stuff that, uh, I probably should, uh --
I' m sorry.
I- I' m writing, and --
I just -- Sure.
No.
That' s okay.
I just have -- You know, this is -- Okay.
- Take care, then.
Jesus!
Hi.
It' s cold.
Okay.
Yeah?
It is frosty.
You' re not a stalker or anything, right?
You' re the one that talked to me.
That is the oldest trick in the stalker book.
Really?
There' s a stalker book?
I gotta read that one.
Look, I' m sorry ifl came off sorta nutso.
I' m not, really.
Oh, it' s okay.
I didn' t thinkyou were.
Did you wanna have a drink?
I have lots of drinks, and I could, um --
Never mind.
I' m embarrassed now.
No, no, no, no.
Good night, Joel.
Two Blue Ruins.
Thankyou.
Drink up, young man.
It' il make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
[Laughs]
You' re kinda closed- mouthed, aren' tyou?
I' m sorry.
It' s just, you know, my life isn' t that interesting.
I go to work, I come home.
Don' t know what tosay.
You should read myjournal.
I mean, it' s just... blank.
Really?
Does that makeyou sadoranxious?
I mean, I' m always anxious, thinking I' m not living my life to the fullest, taking advantage of every possibility, making sure I' m notwasting one second ofthe little time I have.
I thinkabout that.
You' re really nice.
God, I have to stop saying that.
I' m gonna marryyou.
Iknowit.
Um... okay.
Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
It gets frozen this time ofyear.
That sounds scary.
Exactly.
I' il packa picnic.
A night picnic.
And, um, we could --
But I -- I should, uh, go.
You should stay.
No, I really -- I' m -- I --
I have to get up so early.
I would likeyou to call me.
Would you do that?
I would like it.
Yes.
Wish me a happyValentine' s Day when you call!
That' d be nice.
What tookyou so long?
I justwalked in.
You miss me?
Oddly enough, I do.
[Laughs]
I guess that means were married.
[Laughs]
Tomorrow night?
Honeymoon on ice?
It' s really solid this time ofyear.
I don' t know.
Come on.

So beautiful.
[Clementine]

Oh, myass!
I think I should go back.

Okay.
Okay.

Sort of a swoop and a cross.
Osidius the Emphatic.
You' re full ofshit.

Osidius is right there.
Swoop and cross.
Shut the fuck up!
Clementine.
Cock- a- doodle- doo.
Hey.

I' m so tired.
Um, yeah.
Sure.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yes?
Can I helpyou?
What doyou mean?
Can I helpyou with something?
No.
What areyou doing here?
I' m not really sure whatyou' re asking me.
Thanks.
* Everybody' s gotta learn sometime **
We' re looking for 159.
What number' s that?
[Man # 1]
I don' t know where that is.
Jesus Christ, you' d think they' d light the number, or at least put a number on -- [Man # 2]
I think so.
That' s him.
Hey, Joel.
Frank.
Oh, shit.
The only Valentine' s Day cards I get are from mymother.
How pathetic is that, huh?
You' re lucky you have Clementine, man.
She is way cool.
Hey, you got any big Valentine' s Day plans with her?
No.
Don' twant to end up at Mickey D' s.
McRomance!
You want some fries with that shake?
I have to, uh, go to sleep now, Frank.
It' s 8: 30.
Patrick, stop it.
Okay.
Okay.
Showtime at theApollo.
[Frank]
Hey, Joel.
Hi, Frank.
I only get Valentine' s Day cards from my mom.
How pathetic is that?
You' re lucky you have Clementine, Joel.
Hey, you got, uh, any, uh, big Valentine' s Day plans with her?
No.
Better make a reservation or something.
Don' twanna end up at Mickey D' s.
Oh, no!
Yes!
I want it resolved.
I' m willing to be the one to resolve it.
So I call her, and she' s changed her number.
So I walked over to Antic Attic, you know, to get hersomething.
I thought I' d go overto work, give heran earlyvalentine, and --
She' s there with... this guy, this reallyyoung guy.
And she looks at me like she doesn' t even knowwho I am.
Excuse me?
Can I helpyou find something, sir?
Hey, Clem- ato.
Patrick!
Baby boy.
[Patrick]
Just came to surpriseyou.
Let me know ifyou need something, sir.
- [Patrick]
How areyou?
Prettybored.
Why would she do that to me?
Hey, does anybodywant a joint?
Oh, God.
I know, honey.
For being honest.
It' s horrible.
I should just go to her house.
No, no, no.
You don' t wanna go there, man.
You don' t wanna go there.
Get off.
It' s too --
Right.
Yeah.
I don' t want to seem desperate.
Joel, why don' t you just see this as a sign, make a clean break.
Allright, Joel, look, man, seriously.
[Woman]
Here' s the deal.
Don' t do that.
Rob, what areyou doing?
What' s your fucking suggestion, Carrie?
What' s your brilliant, reasoned solution?
You' re gonna make this about our shit now?
This isn' t about us.
It' s not about us.
It' s aboutJoel, who' s an adult.
Not Mama Carrie' s kid.
- What areyou -- - That' s your laundry!
That' s great.
That' s good.
Okay.
What is it?
It' s some place that does a thing.
Good morning.
No, I' m sorry.
That offer expired after the newyear.
Yeah, sure.
How about on the fifth?
That' s a Wednesday.
All right, great.
Couldyou spell that, please?
Okay, and we' il need a daytime phone number.
Great.
Have a nice day.
See you then.
May I help you?
I' m Joel Barish.
Barish.
I have an appointment with Dr. --
Mierzwiak.
Could you please fill this out?
- I just want to talk to him.
You still need to fill the form out, sir.
- Thankyou.
I don' t have a pen.
There' s a pen right there.
Goodmorning.
Oh.
That expiredafterthe newyear.
Mr. Barish?
How are we today?
Oh, my God!
Sorry.
Sorry, I was just -- I' m working!
[Mutters]
[Whispers]
Here, Doctor.
You should not have seen this.
I apologize.
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem --
I assureyou, no.
[Woman]
There' s no such thing as this.
Look, our files are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can' t showyou evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh -- Miss Kruczynski was not happy, and she wanted to move on.
Weprovide thatpossibility.
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on.
We provide that possibility. "
What the hell is that?
Nicest guy she everwent outwith.
Oww!
Give it a rest!
It' s okay.
It' s all right.
Carrie, I am making a birdhouse.
What can Isay, Joel?
She' s like that.
She' s impulsive.
She decided to eraseyou almost as a lark.
A lark.
[Woman]
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I' m sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.
I told him pre- Valentine' s Day is our busy time.
- Oh, th- th- that' s -- that' s okay, Mary.
- But there are people waiting.
Mr. Barish, ifyou' d like to, uh -- to come inside.
And, Mary, ifyou could take care of Mrs. Woo.
Good- bye, Mrs. Woo.
Yes, ofcourse.
Now, the, uh -- the first thing we need you to do, Mr. Barish, is to go home... andcollect evertyhingyou own that has some association with Clementine.
Anything.
And we' il use these items to create a map ofClementine in your brain.
Okay?
So we' il need, uh, uh, photos, clothing, gifts, books she may have boughtyou, CDs you may have bought together, journal entries.
We want to emptyyour home --
We want to emptyyour life ofClementine.
And after the mapping is done, our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight.
That way, when you awake in the morning, you' il findyourselfin your own bed as ifnothing had happened -- a new life awaitingyou.
[Driver]
No, I' m sorry, Mrs. Sobel.
You can' t have the procedure done three times in one month.
Well, it' s just not our policy -- How are you today, Mr. Barish?
I' m right here.
I know it' s an emergency, and we' il do everything we can -- We can fityou in on the first of March.
Maybeyou could talk to the doctor, a- andhe --
All right, so let' s make an appointment.
What daywouldyou like to come in this week?
Mr. Barish.
Um, he' s really busy this afternoon.
Canyou do that?
February is very busy for us because ofValentine' s Day.
This is, uh, Stan Fink, one ofourmost experienced andskilled technicians.
He' il be handling your case tonight.
Great to meetyou, Mr. Barish.
My name is Joel Barish, and I' m here to erase Clementine Kruczynski.
Very good.
Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.
Uh, I was...
Iiving with this woman, Naomi, uh, a coupleyears ago, and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to this party at the beach -- I don' t like parties.
Naomi couldn' t go, but I went... and I, uh, met Clementine.
I' m sorry.
Let' s start with your most recent memories... and work backwards from there, more or less.
There' s an emotional core... to each of our memories, and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process.
Bythe timeyou wake up in the morning, all the memories we' ve targeted will havewithered and disappeared, as in a dream upon waking.
Well, uh, technically speaking, the procedure is brain damage, but it' s on a parwith a night ofheavy drinking.
Nothing you' il miss.
Comfortable?
Whatwe' re doing here, Mr. Barish, is actually creating a map ofyour brain.
Ifwe want to get thisprocedure underwaytonight, we have some work to do.
I want you to react to these objects, Mr. Barish, ifyou will.
There' s a good story behind this one --
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish, I' il get a much better emotional readout... ifyou refrain from any sort of verbal description ofthe items.
Just tryto focus on the memories.
Oh.
Sorry.
Healthyactivityup there again.
Verygood.
- Here' s another object.
That' s so --
Okay.
[Chuckles]
Okay.
[Stan, Voice Electronically Processed]
Patrick, do me a favor.
Hey, Patrick, do me a favor, willya?
Can you check the voltage regulator?
What do we got there?
U h, voltage looks fine.
Really?
I' m -- [Scoffs]
Check the, uh -- Check the connections, please.
Oh, there you are.
Why am I -- I don' t understand what I' m looking at.
Why am I standing here and --
Oh, my God.
Deja vu.
Deja vu.
This is so --
Ifwe' re gonna get the procedure... [Simultaneously]
underwaytonight, we have somework to do.
[Whispering]
I suppose so.
This is what it -- This is what itwould look like.
Very good.
We' il dispose ofthese mementos when we' re done here.
[Stan]
Patrick?
Yeah?
Patrick, canyou check -- Patrick?
I' m gettingsome sort ofreadout ofmy own voice.
Patrick?
- Why are there so many wires?
- Does that help?
How areyou today, Mr. Barish?
There we are, Mr. Barish.
- I don' t know if I like this.
- Think I might try this, then.
We' re almost done now.
Mmm. Journal.
That wouldbe invaluable.
[Stan' s Voice, ElectronicallyAccelerated]
I don' t know what to do.
Her name is Clementine, andshe' s amazing. "
- Whoa!
Jesus!
Come on!
Step back!
Just take it easy.
That' s fine.
Let' s not roach the guy.
All right, you got that one.
This place is sort ofa dump, don' tyou think?
It' s an apartment, Patrick.
Well, not a dump, then, butsorta plain.
Uninspired.
And there' s sort of a stale smell.
Patrick, can wejust please get through this?
We got a very long night ahead of us.
Come on.
Yeah.
This is the last time I sawyou.
It' s 3: 00.
I kinda sorta wreckedyour car.
Were you driving drunk?
It' s pathetic.
I was a little tipsy.
Don' t call me pathetic.
Well, it is pathetic.
It' s fucking irresponsible.
Could' ve killed somebody.
[Sighs]
Maybeyou did kill somebody.
Oh, Christ!
Should I check the grill to see ifthere' s any children orsmall animals?
I didn' t kill anybody!
It' s just a fucking dent, Joel.
Well, what are you like?
A wino?
[Laughing]
Jesus, areyou from the '50s or something?
A wino?
Face it, Joely.
You' re freaked out because I was out latewithoutyou, and in your littlewormy brain... you' re trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
No, see, Clem,
I assume you fucked someone tonight.
Isn' t that howyou get people to likeyou?
I' m sorry.
Clem, I didn' t mean it.
All right?
Clem?
Yourkeys.
I was just -- I was just -- [Sighs]
Angry or annoyed or something, I don' t know.
Clem?
[ComputerBeeps]
Mary' s coming overtonight.
[Patrick]

Ijust don' t thinkshe likes me.
She likes you okay.

Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
We gotta focus here, Patrick.

Get out ofmyface, faggot!
Lookatit outhere!

I' m erasing you, and I' m happy!
You did it to me first!
I can' t believe you did this to me.
Clem!
Can you hear me?
By morning you' il be gone!
The perfect ending to this piece- of- shit story!
Is that a problem?
No, I think it' s... funny.
[Patrick]
So, who doyou think' s better- looking, me or this guy?
Patrick, let' s focus, buddy.
Remember that girl we did last week?
The one with the... potatoes?
That girl?
That' s this guy' s girl.
Right.
[Stan]
[Stan Chuckling]
Was.
We took care ofthat.
I kinda fell in love with her that night.
[Laughing]
You little fuck --
What?
She was unconscious, man.
Well, shewas beautiful, and...
I stole a pair ofher panties as well.
Jesus!
What?
It' s not like --
I don' twanna hearthis shit!
Theywere clean!
[Stan]
What? D- Don' t! Stop!
[Patrick]
[Stan]

It' s not really that bad.
Get that look offyour face.
What' s wrong?
[Stan Continues, Echoing]

Let' s talk about it later.

You can' t just say something like that and sayyou don' t wanna talk about it!
[Whispering]
I' m sorry, Clem.
I' d make a fucking good mother!
I love children, I' m creative and smart, and I' d make a fucking great mother!
[Voice Echoing]
It' s you who can' t commit to anything!
You have no idea how luckyyou are I' m interested in you!
[Voice Fading, Echoing]
Leaveyou at the fea market with this stupid costumejewelry!
It' s done.
All the pain, confusion --
Hi, Mary.
How' s it goin '?
Hey, you.
Oh, it' s freezing outside.
[Mary]
Poor guy.
Don' tyou have anything real to drink?
Uh, we haven' t really checkedyet.
Patrick?
Uh, yeah.
Uh, let me do the honors.
Mary hates me.
Never really had much luck with the ladies.
Maybe ifyou stop stealing their panties.
Stan.
Yes.
Oh, you didn' t want any, did you, Patrick?
"Blessed are the forgetful, forthey get the better even oftheir blunders."
That' s Nietzsche.
BeyondGoodandEvil.
I found it in my Bartlett' s.
What' s your Bartlett' s?
It' s a quote book, Patrick.
It' s a book of quotations.
I think Howard will be in Bartlett' s one day.
Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett' s.
Can you wake him up?
[Patrick Laughing]
You can' t wake him up.
You don' t tell me things, Joel.
I' m an open book.
I tell you everything.
Every damn embarrassing thing.
You don' t trust me.
Constantlytalking isn' t necessarily communicating.
I want to knowyou.
I don' t constantlytalk.
Jesus!
People have to share things, Joel.
That' s what intimacy is.
I' m really pissed thatyou said that to me.
I' m sorry.
Itjust -- reallyjust isn' t that interesting.
I wanna readsome ofthosejournals you' re constantlyscribbling in.
What doyou write in there ifyou don' t have anythoughts orpassions or...
Iove?
November 1 9, 2003.
Dinner at Kang' s again.
Are we like those poor couples... you feel sorry for in restaurants?
Are we the dining dead?
I can' t stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about.
How' s the chicken?
Good.
No.
Thankyou.
She' s gonna be drunk andstupidnow.
Hey, would you do me a favor... and clean the goddamn hair offthe soap when you' re done in the shower?
Oh.
Yeah.
- Gross. - gross.
- It' s just -- - Repulsive.
It' s repulsive.
[Stan]
Patrick.
[Clementine On Phone]
I' m so miserable right now.
Why?
[Clementine]
Excuse me?
Can I helpyou findsomething, sir?
Confused?
What areyou confusedabout?
Evertyhing' s fine.
[Clementine]
[Patrick]
Where' s the self- help section?
Doyou think I' m ugly?
No!
You' re beautiful!
Maybe I should come over.
[Clementine]
I- I' m a mess, Patrick.
[Patrick]
I' il cheeryou up.
Okay.
Stan, can I leave for a while?
My girlfriend' s really upset.
We' re right in the middle of erasing this poor man' s -- [Garbled]
Let him go, Stan!
[Garbled]
Let him go.
I' il help.
- She hates me.
I' il be right over, Tangerine.
You like?
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.
I like it.
Youdo?
You look like a tangerine.
Mmm!
I like that.
I like tangerines!
Can you see me doing ducks?
Joel.
Quack- quack.
How does he know to call you that?
How did who know?
Clem?
[Mary]
The Clash -- the only band that mattered.
They called themselves that for a reason.
It' s amazing, isn' t it?
Like social justice -- Yeah, it' s totally incredible.
What Howard gives to theworld.
[Beeping]
To let people begin again.
It' s beautiful.
And adults are, like, this mess ofsadness... and... phobias.
Howard just makes it all go away.
Baby, what' s going on?
I don' t know.
I don' t know!
I feel like I' m disappearing.
My skin' s coming off!.
Nothing makes any sense to me!
You' re notgetting old.
Nothing makes any sense.
Ohh, Tangerine.
Nothing makes any sense.
Nothing makes any sense, Patrick.
It' s okay.
Hey, let' s go out dancing.
You wanna go out to Montaukwith me?
Montauk?
Yeah.
No!
Come up to Boston with me.
We can go next weekend.
Now.
Yeah.
I have to go now.
I have to see the frozen Charles now.
[AnsweringMachine: Joel]
Um, leave a message afterthe beep and I' il get back toyou.
[Beeps]
Pick up!
Hello?
Yeah, what' s up?
I got into a little situation with the oldlady.
Can you handle things tonight alone?
I' m really sorry, man.
[Continues Giggling]
He' s pretty much on autopilot right now anyway.
Thanks, Stan.
I oweyou big- time.
Dude, I gotta go.
"Look!
You and me on the Charles River.
I could die right now, Clem.
I' m just happy.
I' ve neverfelt that before.
I' m just exactlywhere I want -- "
I' m so excited.
Oh, uh, I, uh --
What? thing, um --
Happy earlyValentine' s Day.
What is it?
Uh, I don' t know.
Open it up.
It -- It' s gorgeous!
It' s just my taste.
I' ve never gone out with a guy who bought me a piece ofjewelry I liked.
Thankyou.
Okay.
Joely?
Am I ugly?
When I was a kid, I thought I was.
Can' t believe I' m crying already.
Sometimes I thinkpeople don' t understandhowlonelyit is to be a kid.
Likeyou don' t matter.
So, I' m eight... and I have these toys, these dolls.
Myfavorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine.
And I keep yelling at her:
"You can' t be ugly!
Be pretty! '
It' s weird.
I would magically change too.
You' re pretty.
Joely, don' t ever leave me.
[Joel' s Voice]
Mierzwiak, please let me keep this memory.
Just this one.
[Clementine]
I don' t wanna holdyour hand.
Stop it!
I could die right now, Clem.
I' m just... happy.
Mmm.
I' m just exactly... where I wanna be.
Clem?
I wanna call it off.
I wanna call it off!.
Can you hear me?
I don' t want this anymore!
Is anybodythere?
Clement -- Joely?
Clem!
Joel?
Clem!
What?
We gotta go.
We gotta go.
I have an idea ofhow to stop this.
Stopwhat?
Come on, Clem.
No.
Good.
We gotta get back to the office.
There was a tape recorder.
No, not the picture.
Where is it?
Back here.
[Clementine]
Hey, I look good there.
[Mierzwiak]
Look, ourfiles are confidential, Mr. Barish, so I can' t showyou evidence.
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh -- Miss Kruczynski... was not happy and she wanted to move on.
Now, tell me about Clementine.
[Joel]
Just tell me evertyhingyou remember.
That' s what he said.
Then -- What did we see that day?
No, wait.
Oh, look!
Shit!
We' re going to see my grandma.
Joel, why -- No, I don' t want to -- Joel, please!
We' re not going on a train.
Don' t make me run anymore.
Come on!
Mierzwiak!
Do we always have to run?
Please.
So, why don' twe begin byyou telling me... evertyhingyou can remember.
Mierzwiak!
Oh, I- I' m sorry, Mr. Barish.
I thoughtyou understood what was going on here.
I don' t know.
You' re erasing her from me.
I don' t know.
You' ve got this thing.
I know it.
I' m part ofyourimagination too, Joel.
How can I helpyou from there?
Uh, I' m insideyourheadtoo.
Sorry.
Look.
Who' s that?
Oh, he- he works for us.
That' s, uh, Pa- a- a- a- atrick, babyboy.
He' s stealing my identity.
He' s, uh, seducing my girlfriend with mywords and mythings.
He stole her underwear.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
He stole her underwear.
[DoorCloses]
I could die right now, Clem.
I' ve neverfelt that before.
I' m just exactlywhere I want to be.
I want to go home.

Clem!
Wait.

[Screams]
Clem, focus.
[Laughing]

What is that?
What the -- [Mary]
It' s a birthmark!
It did work, for a second, but I couldn' t -- I couldn' t move.
See?
Oh, well, isn' t that just another one ofJoel' s self- fulfilling prophecies?
It' s more important to prove mewrong than to actually --
Look, I don' twant to discuss this right now, okay?
Then what?
I' m listening.
I don' t know.
That' s why I' m doing this in the first place.
I' m sorry.
You -- You!
You know me.
That' s what I love aboutyou.
[Beeping]
Ihave anotheridea forthisproblem.
This is a memory of me, the wayyou wanted to have sex on the couch afteryou looked down at my crotch.
What?
Joel, the eraser guys are coming here, sowhat ifyou take me somewhere else, somewhere where I don' t belong, and we hide there till morning?
[Sighs]
I can' t remember anything withoutyou.
Tsk, that' s very sweet, but try, okay?
Okay.

Listen, would you hate me ifl asked you to clean some string beans?
Oh, my God.
Thankyouso much.
She' s not looking at me.
She' s not looking at me.
No one ever looks at me.
I want my mommy.
Oh, babyJoel.
Hey, Joely! Joely!

He' s fine.
Do you have something to drink?
I mean, I know it' s not 5: 00.

Hey, no, sweetie.
[Grunting]

Don' t cry, babyJoel.
BabyJoel, it' s okay.
Joel. Joely. Joel!
Stop it! Look, I think it' s working.
Look, we' re hidden, Joel.
Hey, honey, look.
Wait there.
My crotch is still here, just as you remembered it.
Yuck.
It stopped.
What?
It stopped erasing.
Oh, shit.
This is terrible.
He' s offthe map.
He' s offthe map.
I don' t knowwhere!
What doyou mean?
I don' t know where!
This is very, very bad news.
Where are my glasses?
Okay.
What do we do?
What do I do?
What shall we do?
I don' t know what to do.
Crap.
I don' t know!
- I just said that I don' t know what to do.
- I' m sorry.
What do we do?
Now, look, you' re freaking me out.
Mellow out.
Well, you have to do something.
He could wake up all half- baked.
Quiet.
Shh.
Shh.
Hmm, that sounds so good.
Oh, shit!
I' m hungry.
Oh, shit.
Oh!
What?
Oh!
- We should call Howard.
- No way.
No, sir, man.
This is my -- I can handle this.
I can' t call Howard.
He' s -- There' s no time to fuck around.
I got this under control.
What areyou talking about?
Okay, I' il call Howard.
[Rings]
Hello.
Hello, Howard?
Um, I' m working on this guy down here, and we seem to have lost him for a moment, and, uh, I can' t -- I can' t bring him back up.
Okay, uh, tell me what happened before he disappeared.
Well, I wasn' t sure, really, 'cause I was awayfrom the monitor for a minute... and I had it on autopilot because I had to, uh --
I had to pee.
Where' s Patrick?
Patrick had to go home sick.
Ah, geez.
Okay, what' s the address?
I' m so sorry.
That' s okay.
I' m at 159 South Village.
Yeah.
Rockville Center.
Mary?
He' s coming right now.
I' m staying.
[Bottles Clinking]
- Get your stuff, Mary.
I thinkyou should go.
Hell, no.
Mary -- Shit.
I am so stoned.
You have to go.
Stop being stoned, Mary.
I don' t want him to see me stoned.
Mary, you have no idea howmuch trouble we' re gonna get into ifHowardcomes -- I look like shit!
Joely, stop it! Joel!
Hey, Joel!
I want her to pick me up.
It' s weird how strong that desire is.
Look.
You' il remember me in the morning, and you' il come to me, and you' il tell me about us, and we' il start over.
Pat?
I just -- Pat?
I thought we could have a little cocktail.
That Patrick guy -- he' s copying me.
What Patrick guy?
That guy!
What?
He' s here in my apartment.
He' s one ofthose eraser guys.
He fell foryou when theywere doing you, and now he' s introduced himself like he doesn' t even knowyou, and you guys are dating.
Really?
Is he cute?
Clem, there' s nothing wrong with you.
You' re the mostwonderful person I' ve ever met.
beautiful... and smart and funny... and... nice.
What?
Okay.
Come on.
Careful, careful.
Fine.
Oh, my God.
Those eyedrops you gave me didn' t do shit.
Cool.
Hello, Mary.
What areyou doing here?
Oh, hi, Howard.
I wanted to understand as much as I could about the procedure as possible.
I think it' s important for myjob to understand the innerworkings... ofthe work that we do.
Well, not that I do, but thework that is done... by people... where I also work, the work of my colleagues.
All right, well, let' s see ifwe can, uh, get to the bottom ofthis, shall we?
Well, that' s odd.
Did you try going through the C- gate?
I mean... yes.
Yeah.
All right.
You want to get linked up?
I already -- I ran the utility programs, and I had nothing there, so I checked all the memories against the printed logs.
Okay.
I gotyou a chair.
Oh, thankyou.
Whew!
All right, I' m gonna -- I' m gonna go through the entire memory, see ifsomething comes up.
* Oh, my darling Clementine *
* Dreadful sorry, Clementine ** Such a feeling ofsecurity.
I' ve never seen you happier, babyJoel.
There it is.
I don' t understand why it' s offthe map like that.
What the heck was he doing there?
His eyesare open.
- Has this happened beforewith him?
Oh, this is -- this is not good.
I' m gonna have to give him this.
Can' tyou see I loveyou, Antoine?
Okay, we' re back in.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard.
Like a surgeon or a concert pianist or something.
I- I think I' il be fine now.
Whycan' tyousee I loveyou, Antoine?
Lucky me.
Lay one on me.
Don' t call me Antoine.
Myname is Wally.
Yes, Iknow, but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally?
What was that?
Hey.
My God, there' s people coming out ofyour butt.
There is?
- Got it.
- Tangerine!
What, Joel -- What are you doing?
We gotta go.
Please, please, go.
Please go!
You can run, butyou can' t hide.
Clem, come on!
There I am.
[Tires Screech]
Doc?
Please.
Allright, let' s begin byyou tellingme... everything you remember --
He' s in a memory that we' ve already erased.
Oh, well, at least we know where he is.
He' s back on track, right?
[Sighs]
Come on, Clem.
[Stan' s Voice]
Heseems to have developedsomesort ofresistance to theprocedure.
Shit.
Come on, come on.
Hide me somewhere deeper, somewhere really buried.
Hide me in your humiliation.
Humiliation.
- No, wait.
He' s disappeared again.
Oh, dear.
I' m so sorry, Howard.
Humiliation.
Humiliation.
Hu- mi- lia -- Joel.
I don' t like it either.
I' m just trying to find horrible secret places to --
Joel, honey, I have a surprise -- I just -- Oh, um --
I' mjust gonna askyou in the morning.
[Wheezing Laugh]
I' m sorry, Joel. Joely.
Shut up.
Look!
Joel!
Joel, look!
Lookwherewe are!
Whoo!
Clem, this isn' t good.
Then hide me somewhere -- somewhere really buried.
[Children Shouting]
Hit it!
I can' t!
I gotta go home.
I' ildo it later!
[Shouting Continues]
Ooh, he has a girlfriend!
What am I doing?
You know something, Freddy?
Andhe loves her!
Joel!
Joely, get up.
Come on, it' s not worth it.
They' re notworth it, Joel!
Tra- la- la- la- la!
He' s not listening!
Come on, Joel.
I' m so ashamed.
[Clementine' s Voice]
It' s okay.
You were a little kid.
Yeah?
Come on.
That' s where I live -- lived.
I wish I knewyou when I was a kid.
Do you like mypink hat?
Here, look, feel better.
You can really kill me this time.
Go.
I can?
Okay.
One, two, three.
You' re dead.
Oh, my mom.
It' s -- It' s okay.
We' re playing.
Hi, Joel' s mom.
It' s not real.
Okay, are you deadyet?
You' re dead!
Uh, I think I got the hang of this.
I still don' t understand it, but I' m finding him quickly enough.
Jo -- Joely?
Areyou okay, Joel?
[Laughing]
Oh, myGod.
Thatwas terrible.
Allright.
Letme do it one more time.
One more, then I get to go.
Look at this.
This is so cool!
Look out!
Our house!
Come on.
Come on.
We gotta go!
Come on!
We gotta go.
Clem?
This is a really bad time forthis!
Get offme!
Oh, God!
I don' t even know wherewe' re going.
Come on.
It' s the best place.
No, this way.
No, this way.
You' re no help at all.
Let go ofme, Joel!
I likewatchingyou work, Howard.
I guess I' il go out for -- for some air, ifnobody minds.
It looks likeyou have everything under control here.
Yeah, that' s, uh -- that' s fine.
[DoorCloses]
What doyou mean?
Oh, you know, like famous quotes?
I find reading them inspirational, and in my reading, I' ve come across some I thoughtyou might like too.
Oh, well, I -- I' d love to hear some.
There' s one that goes,
"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even oftheir blunders."
That' s Nietzsche, right?
And here I thought I could tell you something you didn' t know.
It' s -- It' s a good quote.
Yeah.
Oh, and there' s this other one I like.
AlexanderPope?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, shit.
It' sjust that I toldmyself not to say "PopeAlexander" andsound like a dope, and then I go ahead and say it.
It' s no big deal.
The quote goes, "Howhappyis the blameless vestal' s lot?
"The world forgetting, bythe world forgot.
"Eternal sunshine ofthe spotless mind.
Each prayer accepted and each wish resigned. "
I want to be a great big, huge elephant... with a huge trunk like that.
Clem?
Clementine?
I haven' t heard that one.
I just thought it would be appropriate, maybe.
I really admire theworkyou do, Howard.
I don' t mean to be so familiar.
It' s fine.
I- I- I- I- I -- I' m happyto hear --
I' m sorry.
I' ve loved you for a very long time.
I shouldn' t have said that.
Oh, Mary, no.
It' s -- You' re a wonderfulgirl.
You know I have a wife and kids.
Oh, Mary.
Oh, Mary, we can' t do this.
Well, good morning, Mrs. Mierzwiak.
What?
Oh, myGod!
Who is it?
Thankyou, Stan.
Hollis!
[Engine Starts]
Hollis!
Hollis.
- I knew it, Howard.
- Hollis, it didn' t start out to be like this.
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one- time mistake!
I' m astupidgirl withastupidcrush!
I swear I basically forced him into it!
Don' t be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.
Tell mewhat?
You can have him.
You did.
What?
we have a history.
Y- You wanted the procedure.
You --
You wanted it done... soyou could get past, uh --
You could -- Yeah.
Um, I have to, uh, finish the work in there.
We' il talk later.
Okay?
Let me giveyou a lift home.
Fuck this thing.
Damn it.
Hi.
Didn' t figureyou' d showyourface around me again.
I guess I thought you were... humiliated.
You did run away, after all.
Ijust neededtoseeya.
Yeah?
I' d like to, um, takeyou out or something.
You' re married.
Not married.
No, I' m not married, no.
Look, man, I' m telling you right offthe bat I' m high maintenance, so I' m not gonna tiptoe around your marriage... orwhatever it is you' ve got going there.
Ifyou wanna be with me, you' re with me.
Too many guys think I' m a concept, or I complete them, or I' m gonna make them alive.
But I' m just a fucked- up girl who' s looking for my own peace ofmind.
Don' t assign meyours.
I rememberthat speech reallywell.
I had you pegged, didn' t I?
You had thewhole human race pegged.
Probably.
I still thoughtyou were gonna save my life, even afterthat.
I know.
Itwould be different... ifwe could just give it another go around.
Remember me.
Tryyour best.
Maybe we can.
Okay, sojust tell me whatyou remember, and, uh, then we' il take it from there.
[Mary]
I liked you immediately.
Youdidn' t come on to me at all.
Ilikedthat.
I was so tongue- tied aroundyou at first.
I wantedyou to think I was smart.
I couldn' t wait to come to work.
I had these fantasies of us being married... and having kids and... just --
Oh, Howie, I can' t do this.
We agreedit' s forthe best, Mary.
[MaryCrying]
Oh, God.
I' il take the bottom and you -- Uh- uh- uh!
I can take that.
So you want me to carry that?
Help me with that.
Can you get the cooler?
Honey, the cooler is --
That' s light, huh?
You can get it.
Don' t take anything.
I can take the plane.
Put the thing up.
This is the daywe met.
You were down bythesurf.
I couldjust makeyou out in the distance.
I rememberbeing drawn toyou even then.
I thought, "Wow, how odd.
I' m drawn to someone' s back. "
You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well... and even hate, eventually.
At the time I thought, "How cool!
An orange sweatshirt. "
Hi there.
Hi.
I saw you sitting over here... byyourself, and I thought, "Thank God.
Someone normal who doesn' t know how to interact at these things either. "
Yeah.
I don' t ever knowwhat to say.
I' m Clementine.
Can I borrow a piece ofyour chicken?
And then you just took it... withoutwaiting for an answer.
Itwas so intimate,
Iikewewere already lovers.
I' m Joel.
Hi, Joel.
So, nojokes about my name.
You mean like -- * Oh, my darling, oh, my darling Oh, my darling Clementine *
Huckleberry Hound, that sort ofthing?
Like that.
Oh, nojokes.
One ofmyfavorite things when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll.
I thinkyour name is magical.
This is it, Joel.
It' s gonna be gone soon.
I know.
Enjoy it.
[Clementine]
You married?
Let' s move into this neighborhood!
I do sort oflive with someone though.
Male orfemale?
Female.
At least I' m not barking up thewrong tree.
You know these people?
No, of course not.
They might have a dog.
[Giggling]
What areyou doing?
It' s freezing out.
I can' t believe this.
- Clementine!
- There we go.
Come on, man.
The water' s fine.
Believe me.
It' s dark.
So, uh, what' s your girlfriend' s name?
Naomi, but we' re not really -- I mean --
We' re -- [Laughing]
So this is great.
Now I can look for, um, candles, matches... and the liquor cabinet.
Oh, God.
I think we should go.
There' s no phone line.
What?
It' s our house... just for tonight.
Which one doyou want to be?
I preferto be Ruth, but I can be fexible.
What areyou do -- [Chuckling]
Oh, boy.
So, areyou okaywith wine?
I don' t know.
Well, you choose thewine.
I' m gonna go find the bedroom and slip into something more...
I' m Ruth- less at the moment.
I' ve gotta catch my ride.
So go.
I thought maybeyou were a nut, butyou were exciting.
I wishyou' dstayed.
I wish I' d stayed too.
I wish I' d done a lot of things.
Oh, God, I wish I had --
I wish I' d stayed.
I do.
Well, I came back downstairs, andyou were gone.
I walked out.
Why?
I don' t know.
I felt like a scared little kid.
I don' t know.
You were scared?
Thoughtyou knew that about me.
I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun myhumiliation, I think.
Was it something I said?
Yeah.
You said, "So go"... with such disdain, you know?
Oh, I' m sorry.
It' s okay.
Joely?
What ifyou stayed this time?
I walked out the door.
There' s no memory left.
Come back and make up a good- bye, at least.
Let' s pretend we had one.
Bye, Joel.
I loveyou.
Meet me in Montauk.
Ididn' t crash theplane.
Theplane crashed.
[Carrie]
You' re stoned, andyou' re driving.
Yeah, the pot balances it out.
The pot brings you back up.
Ifl' m going to be drinking, then I' il smoke it.
That' s a medical fact.
It was proven on the Science Network.
Honey, just watch the road.
I can' t see shit.
I saw you talking to somebody pretty.
She was nice.
Yeah, man.
She was, um, just a girl.
Okay.
So I gotta -- I gotta drop the van off.
Thanks, Stan.
We' il talk.
Hey!
Hey.
You got a lot ofyour stuff there, I see.
My stuff.
I wouldn' t come back ifl wasyou either.
Do you swearyou didn' t know?
So you didn' t do the erasing?
God, no.
And you never even suspected we were together?
[Sighs, Clears Throat]
I was coming back from a job, and you were at his car.
I sawyou two talking.
So I waved toyou, and you giggled, you know.
You looked happy.
Happywith a secret.
And afterthat?
I never sawyou two together again like that, so I just --
I don' t know.
I really likeyou, Mary Svevo.
You know that?
Thanks.
Let me get my toothbrush.
[Patrick On Tape]
Where areyou, Clem?
I feellikeyou' re madat me, and I don' t know what I did.
What did I do?
I loveyou so much.
I' il do anything to makeyou happy.
Tell me whatyou want me to do, and I' il do it.
Listen, I' m gonna stop by this morning just to make sure you' re okay.
Vamonos, senor.
I - I had a really nice time last night.
Nice?
I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life...
Iast night.
This is weird.
[Mary' s Voice]
Toallpatients ofDr.
HowardMierzwiak.
Myname is MarySvevo.
[Mary' s Voice Overlapping]
I worked for a companyyou hired to have part ofyour memory erased. "
Ihavesince decided that this is a horrible -- Some kind ofteaser ad or something.
In orderto correct this, I' m sending everyone' s file back to them.
Myname is Clementine Kruczynski.
I' m here to eraseJoel Barish.
What is this?
I don' t know.
He' s boring.
Is that enough reason to erase someone?
I' ve been thinking lately how I was before and how I am now, and it' s like he changed me.
I don' t like myselfanymore.
That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.
- That sort ofwounded puppyshit he does, you know?
- What are you doing?
I 'm not doing anything.
- Are you screwing with me?
- You are screwing with me.
- Joel, I' m not!
- You clearly are.
- Look, let' s just take a minute and --
Oh, sweetheart -- Get the fuck away from me!
Can we talk about it?
No!
Joel Barish.
Hey, Clementine.
Nice to seeyou.
Reallyveryeducated.
I mean, she' s smart, I think, but not educated.
I couldn' t reallytalk to her about books, you know?
She' s more of a magazine- reading girl.
Hervocabularyleaves something to be desired.
Sometimes -- I was embarrassed in public...
Hi. because she wouldpronounce...
Iibrary "libary." Hi.
Look what I found.
I think ifthere' s a trulyseductive quality about Clementine, it' s that herpersonalitypromises to take you out ofthe mundane.
You made me look skinny.
Amazing, burning meteorite... will carryyou to another world where things are exciting.
But whatyou quickly learn is that... it' s really an elaborate ruse.
I 'm sorry I yelled at you.
It' s okay.
Joel, I really like you.
I hate that I said mean things aboutyou.
- Let me turn this off, okay?
- Hey, it' s -- it' s onlyfair.
I mean, the whole thing with the hair -- it' s all bullshit.
- I really like your hair.
I reallylikeyourhair.
You want a drink or something?
Do you have anywhiskey?
No, I don' t think hersex is... motivated.
I sawit clearly the last night we were together.
It wasjust sad.
I thought there was more.
The only way Clem thinks she can get people to like her... is to fuck 'em... or at least dangle the possibility ofgetting fucked in front of' em.
And she' s so desperate and insecure... that she' il, sooner or later, go around fucking everybody.
I don' t do that.
I wouldn' t think that aboutyou.
- Because I don' t.
Because it reallyhurts me thatyou said that because I don' t do that.
I' m sorry about all this.
I don' t really think I can be here.
Um... bye.
Bye.
Itwas nice meeting you and all.
What a loss tospend that much time with someone, onlyto findout thatshe' s a stranger.
Wait.
What?
I don' t know.
Just wait. Just wait.
What doyou want, Joel?
I don' t know.
I want you to wait for... just a while.
Okay.
Really?
I' m not a concept, Joel.
I' mjust a fucked- up girl who' s looking formy own peace ofmind.
- I' m not perfect.
- I can' t see anything that I don' t like about you.
Right now I can' t.
Butyou will.
You know, you will thinkofthings, and I' il get bored with you and feel trapped... because that' s what happens with me.
Okay.
Okay.
[Crying]
Okay.
Don' t move!
Get down!
Get down!
Hello.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Captain David Ward, British Army.

- And where are you from?
- Denmark.
- What' s your rank?
- Major.

- Yes.
Yes, of course.
How were you treated in the camp?
I' m alive.
- Yes, sir.
You were lucky.
Did you have any contact with the other captives?
- What do you mean?
- You must have seen them.
- I' d like you to look at.
These photo also contain non- British nationals.
We just need to know if you' ve seen any of these men.
No.
I' m sorry.
You' re certain you' ve never seen these faces?
No.
I' m sorry.
Well, thank you, sir.
Now get some rest.
- You' ve earned it.
- Thank you.
Michael!
Jesus, it' s good to see you!
Likewise.
I want to talk to my wife.
Why can' t I talk to her?
Has something happened to her?
We thought you were all dead.
You' ve been declared dead.
Have l?
All we knew was that you crashed.
What does my epitaph say?
I hope Jannik didn' t write it.
- Up you go.
Are you drunk?
- No, you' re drunk!
You look plastered to me.
How much did you drink?
Sarah speaking.
Yes?
- I want it!
- Don' t do that.
- I want to throw it...
- Throw it!
Go on!
- Natalia, what happened?
- What did you do to my sister?
You' re too easy!
What' s wrong?
Hi, dad.
- Don' t cry now.
- I' m not crying.
- Who will get there first?
- I will.
You have to see the kitchen, dad.
Come on, quickly.
- Look what we made for you.
- Jesus...
Who did this?
Jannik and the three little pigs.
- Did Jannik do this?
- Yes, and some carpenters.
- Are you hungry?
- No, thanks.
What are you doing?
What' s he doing?
What' s going on?
Can' t we just lie here on the bed for a while?
All of us.
Come on.
- How long do we have to lie here?
- Just a little while longer.
Can I go watch TV?
- Just stay a little longer.
- Okay.
ls dad dead again already?
- He' s just sleeping.
- You can' t die more than once.
- Yes, you can.
- No, you bloody well can' t.
- Hi, Michael.
- Can I talk to you in private?
Of course.
We' il go down to the office.
- Are you managing alright?
- Sure.
I wasn' t alone at the camp.
I saw Niels Peter.
We were in the same camp.
I didn' t think you had any contact with others.
But it' s good you remembered it.
Yes.
He were in the same camp.
I...
It can be difficult to remember what happened.
- What?
- Sit down, Michael.
Michael, when we find out what took place, I' il pass on the information.
Just take it easy.
Give yourself some time...
Then your memory will come back to you.
I' m better than I thought.
Thank you for taking care of Sarah and the girls.
I didn' t expect that.
- But of course.
- I mean it.
I' m proud of you.
Yes, of course.
It suddenly made sense, right?
I want to ask you something.
I know it sounds far out.
I don' t mind if you have.
Did you sleep with her?
- What?
- With Sarah.
I can forgive you.
I just want to know.
- I mean, you thought I was dead.
- But... we didn' t.
What the...?
Of course we haven' t.
Michael...
- I can forgive you.
- We haven' t.
- What makes you think that?
- You look like teenagers in love.
Come on!
You used to be pissed off because I couldn' t stand her.
Now that I' ve found out how nice and lovely she is, is that wrong, too?
- No, no.
- Then don' t say things like that.
She' s way too old for me anyway.
Shall we...?
Tobias is stupid, but Arnold is nice.
He never hits people.
- He never hits people?
Not girls.
He' s the best at maths, and he' s got a dog with big ears.
- I can' t remember its name.
- Elephant?
It' s not a dog, is it?
An elephant is not a dog.
- It was only a joke.
- But it' s not funny. ls it?
Sitting there talking nonsense...!
Michael, relax.
It' s alright.
Don' t be afraid.
And don' t be sad.
The girls have taken a fancy to Jannik, haven' t they?
- He said he' s slept here.
- Yes, a few times.
- Did he sleep in here?
- Of course he didn' t.
You could have fallen for each other.
- You thought I was dead.
- No, we couldn' t have.
- You look so cute together.
- Stop it.
- Did you sleep with him?
- Michael, stop it.
- You slept with him.
- Michael, nothing happened.
We kissed.
We were just confused.
- What else?
- That' s it.
Let go.
Let me go!
Let me go...
What the hell is wrong with you?!
What the hell are you doing?!
You' re crazy!
Crazy!
Don' t be afraid of me.
Your hair looks nice.
Did mum do this?
- Natalia did.
- Did you?
Yes.
Don' t be afraid of me.
Alright?
I' m sorry that I shouted and did all those silly things.
But I love you.
Very much.
Both of you.
Don' t be sad.
Don' t cry.
I want you to be happy.
I want us all to be happy.
Promise me that you' il both be happy.
Do you know this one?
What is white in the air and yellow on the ground?
An egg.
- Have I told you that one?
- A hundred times.
ls that right?
A hundred times?
- Shall I push you?
- Yes, please.
Michael...
We have to talk about this.
Can' t you tell me what happened?
- Nothing happened.
- Oh, come on.
Can' t you tell me just a little bit?
- Tell me just a little bit.
- There is nothing to tell.
I sat in a dark room, thinking.
- and the time we broke up.
- but you wouldn' t let me in.
Come in!
- Ditte.
- Michael.
I' m glad you people call all the time, even if there is no news.
As long as we don' t hear anything, there' s still hope.
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yes, please.
Thank you.
I saw Niels Peter down there.
He was down there.
- Did you see him?
- We were in the same camp.
Why didn' t he come home with you?
He was moved to another camp.
That means he' s still alive!
Yes...
When he...
He was moved to another camp, but he was fine when I saw him.
He' il make it.
Would you like some cake?
We were together for a long time and he told me about Gustav...... and about you, of course.
He told me all sorts of things.
- You' re taking your driving test.
- I didn' t pass.
No, he said you wouldn' t...
- He was very proud of Gustav.
- He really wanted a girl.
But when Gustav came along, he was so pleased.
I' m sorry.
- Hi.
- Hello.
This is Solvej.
Sorry.
Solvej, my brother' s wife Sarah.
Come on in.
- There you go.
- Do I look okay?
You look fantastic.
Come on in.
Sorry.
Hi.
This is Solvej and this is my dad and my mum.
- This is my brother, Michael.
- Natalia is watching TV.
- This is Camilla, the birthday girl.
- Thank you so much.
We just met.
It happened so fast.
It' s very nice to meet you.
Great!
- Where' s the bathroom?
- Upstairs.
I' il show you.
Taking a piss again?
Why don' t you open it?
Where did you meet her?
At the Royal Library.
What do you think? ln a bar.
- She certainly looks...
- She seems quite nice.
Lovely, lovely.
Rationally...!
What are you talking about?
It' s war.
Today people need therapy when they fall off their bikes.
- They' re soldiers and trained for it.
- Stop messing with that doll!
Maybe they' re not trained to see people get shot.
- What do you think they trained for?
- Yes, but...
- That doesn' t make it nice, does it?
- Now Solvej has a point here.
- lf it was nice everyone would do it.
- Stop it, Natalia!
Stop it, Natalia!
Eat up.
You hardly touched it.
- I' m not hungry.
I want to watch TV.
- Eat your dinner.
Camilla ate her dinner.
But then Camilla got the best doll.
I didn' t get my bag.
- You' il eat your dinner.
- You don' t decide shit around here!
- Couldn' t you just stay dead?
- Natalia!
Why are you taking it out on me?
You' re just pissed off because mum would rather shag Jannik.
- What are you saying?
- You and Jannik shag all the time.
- That' s enough!
- Disgusting!
Oh, stop it.
She has no idea what she' s saying.
- Give me your plate.
- It' s not true.
This is insane.
She' s just upset.
How long were you in lndia, Solvej?
- Four months.
- Did you ride elephants?
- That is so far out.
- Were you up north?
It' s beautiful.
- No, we didn' t have time.
- Little bastard.
Who the hell do you think you are?
I forgot I have to meet some friends, so...
Sit down, all of you.
It' s Camilla' s birthday.
- Nobody is leaving.
- I don' t think we need that tone...
Oh, be quiet.
You don' t know what Natalia has seen.
What does that matter?
It' s difficult for all of us.
The important thing here is Camilla' s birthday.
- Yes, that' s right!
- And we' re celebrating that.
Mum...!
- Mum!
- Shut up!
Mum.
- Why aren' t you asleep?
- I can' t sleep.
That was the worst birthday in my entire life.
We' il have a new one.
I promise.
What are you playing at?
I' m sorry about what I said.
Why did you say it?
I don' t like dad.
I' d rather have Jannik around instead of dad.
Me too.
Dad will be himself again soon.
Michael.
Get out of my way!
- Mum!
- Go up to your room.
Now!
- Please stop.
- Do you realise what I did?
Do you realise what I did to be with you?
You don' t understand anything!
I' m going to fucking kill you!
Should I kill you?!
I' m going to fucking kill you!
I' m going to kill you!
I' m going to kill you!
I' m going to kill all of you!
Jannik.
Michael' s gone berserk.
Hurry!
Come on down, girls.
Come on down.
The police, please.
I' m bloody well going to kill you!
I' m going to kill you all!
Sorry...
Don' t cry.
I' m going to kill you!
Sarah.
Sarah...
- My little brother.
- Jannik.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let' s all sit down and talk about it.
- Sarah, go to the car.
- Go to your room!
- Go to your room!
- Stop it!
- Michael!
- Go upstairs again!
Sarah!
Take the car keys!
What did you do?
You call that a punch?
Michael, Michael...
Did you call the cops?!
- Did you call the cops?!
- Michael...
Did you call the cops?!
Of course I didn' t call the cops!
You idiot!
- Stop there.
Stop right there.
We got into a fight.
Nothing happened.
Stay down!
- Fuck, man!
He took my gun.
- Drop the gun.
Drop it!
- Drop the gun, Michael.
- Then shoot me.
- Drop the gun!
- Come on!
- Shoot me, then.
- Shut up!
Come on!
You' il get a promotion.
Michael, drop the gun.
- Drop the gun.
- Who the hell are you?
Who the hell are you?
- Michael, for my sake.
- Shoot me.
Come on!
Shoot me!
- Put the gun down.
- Drop it!
- On the ground, both of you.
- On the ground.
- Get down!
- Michael, get down.
- Get down on your belly.
- Lie down on you belly, okay?
Michael...
Do it!
Arms stretched out!
Handcuff both of them.
Don' t move.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Fuck...
He' il get off lightly.
He' s never been in trouble before and has a bag full of medals.
This is incredible.
Oh, I should be careful not to drop ashes in here.
- Let' s clean this up.
- Yes.
I' il throw this out.
I wiII always love you.
That is the only truth that remains.
Life is neither right nor wrong, good or bad.
But I love you.
That' s aII I know.
PRlSON
Michael Lundberg, visitor for you.
She' s waiting outside.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Visit number 00412.
- Do you want to walk or sit?
- Okay.
- Take a walk?
- Yes.
- Did you have your hair cut?
- No.
I' m wearing mascara.
That' s right.
- You look good.
- Thanks.
This is from the girls.
- How are they?
- They' re fine.
And mum and dad?
Michael...
- I want to know what happened.
- No, you don' t.
It doesn' t concern you or anyone else.
It' s my problem, alright?
lf you don' t tell me, you' il never see me again.
Ever.
I can' t.
Yes, you can.
He had a little boy.
He had a little boy.
"The current spell of icy weather has claimed its first victim.
A motorcyclist froze to death on Highway 4 and drove for a further 90 km after he was dead.
Two patrolmen flagged him down and as he didn' t react they pursued him.
They drove alongside and rebuked him for his attitude.
As he didn' t move they realized something was wrong. "
It seems incredible.
It' s a wonderful image.
A dead young man drives his motorcycle across the icy plain, escorted by two patrolmen.
Where was he going in that icy dawn?
To see someone who couldn' t wait until the morning.
There' s a story here!
I' il cut it out and keep it, it might inspire me.
I' il get it.
Hello.
Hello.
What is it?
I' m an actor.
I' m looking for Enrique Goded.
He isn' t here.
But I can see him, man.
In any case, we don' t have any projects, so...
I' d like to speak to him.
We were old pals at school.
I' m Ignacio Rodríguez.
All right, come in.
Thank you.
I don' t think he' il see you.
That' s all right.
Wait a minute.
He' s an actor, a nuisance!
I told him we aren' t preparing a film now.
Tell him I' m not in.
I did, but he saw you.
And I can see him.
He said he was a friend of yours at school.
Who can he be?
Ignacio Rodríguez.
¿lgnacio?
It can' t be!
That' s what he said.
Ignacio, is it really you?
Of course, Enrique!
I' m delighted you remember me!
How could I forget you?
Well, it' s been sixteen years.
That long?
More or less.
I wouldn' t recognize you with that beard.
You' d look better without it.
Come into my office.
You want a coffee?
No, thanks.
I' m having one.
Then, yes.
Martín, will you make some coffee?
Yes.
Sit down.
What brings you here?
I came to ask for work.
I' m an actor.
I' ve brought you my resume.
Bumblebee Group.
An independent theater company.
"El Retablillo de San Cristóbal" by García Lorca,
"The Diary of Adam and Eve" by Mark Twain...
Mark Twain, García Lorca...
Only the best for the Bumblebee.
Don' t you write anymore?
No, I stopped ages ago.
But I' ve brought my last story.
"The Visit"
By the way, when are you starting your next film?
Well...
I' il do anything.
We' re eyeing tabloids to see if I can think of stories.
You' ve caught me in a creative crisis.
That' s a bummer!
Read my story, it might give you some ideas.
What' s it about?
Our school.
One part is based on our childhood, and the other part isn' t, when the characters grow up.
That' s fiction.
I haven' t introduced you.
Ignacio, Martín.
Pleased to meet you.
Sugar and milk?
Yes, please.
By the way, I don' t call myself Ignacio anymore.
I' m Ángel.
Why' s that?
It' s my stage name.
An actor can' t be called Ignacio Rodríguez.
He can' t?
Of course not.
Ángel Andrade.
Everyone calls me that, even my mother.
That' s great.
Thank you.
Ignacio was..
Ángel.
Ignacio...
Ángel.
Well, Ignacio, before he became Ángel, was... is an old school friend.
Martín is my production director. and maid of all work.
Well, Ignacio...
Ángel...
Right, Ángel.
I' m delighted to see you.
AS soon as I' ve got anything...
Give me your number, I' il call you.
I don' t have a phone, but I' il call you.
Should I leave you another photo?
No, don' t worry.
Well, Ángel, it was great seeing you.
So should I go?
Yes, I think so.
Can' t I help you cut out...?
No, thanks a lot.
So long.
My pleasure.
You look great!
So do you.
Do read "The Visit"
Yes, I will.
I' m dying of curiosity.
Great.
See you.
I thought he' d never leave!
Is he really a friend of yours?
Yes.
I haven' t seen him since school.
We were really close.
Well, he was my first love.
But he' s changed a lot.
I didn' t recognize him.
Will you see him again?
No.
It seemed that you liked him.
No, there' s nothing less erotic than an actor looking for work.
"The Visit".
I' ve been waiting for this moment.
Today we' re playing in the town where I went to school.
I won' t mention its name so as not to promote it.
I owe my best memories to the Olympo Cinema, which is now in ruins.
Card.
I' m fucking sick of losing!
Then clear off.
Take a break.
Thank you.
She defines herself as a mix of desert, hazard, and cafeteria.
She' s a great artiste and a great friend of mine.
With all of you, our next act, the mystery and the fascination of the one and only, the inimitable,
Zahara!
A bit of applause for Crissake!
So...
What?
Listen...
I' il see you at the hostel.
Yeah, but...
Paquito, you heard me.
You' ve got time for everything, fag.
Monda!
Wait for me, love!
Hello.
Hello.
What' s wrong?
I can' t find my keys.
May I help you?
Sure.
No, they' re not here.
Let' s see.
Not here either.
No?
No.
Here they are!
My lips are wearing out!
I drank too much.
You' re telling me.
Hey!
I' m sucking your dick!
He' s out cold!
A kid.
Not a cent.
A lottery ticket.
I' il keep that.
Don' t start the engine right outside.
But he' s passed out!
Well hung, isn' t he?
He' s not bad.
And look, he' s still hard!
let me suck him off a bit.
No, you' ve got things to do.
You' ve been at him for hours.
Look at your lip!
Come on, the bike won' t run away.
Shut up!
Now, go hide the bike.
Hurry back, I' il see you in your room before 7: 00.
Sure, I get all the dirty work and you have all the fun.
Now you get a hard- on, asshole!
It' s not fair!
Enrique Serrano!
Enrique!
Paquito!
Come up here!
What about the bike?
Leave it there.
Come up.
There' s nothing like loading up on drugs and hormones to end up as crazy as you, bitch.
The keys!
We' re not stealing the bike!
Why not?
We' ve got a buyer.
I' il explain later.
I' il meet you at the mass.
So we' re going to the school? yes, now more than ever.
I' m flipping out, bitch!
I bet you are.
Dear Enrique, It' s me, Ignacio.
I' ve dreamed so much of this moment!
Years have gone by but I' ve never forgotten you.
We have to meet again, but when you' re not drunk.
like when we got out of school on weekends.
I' m not going to complicate your life.
I know you' re married and have a child.
I know that you live in the next town, that you' re broke and that I' d like to help you.
Right now, I' m working on something, but i' il explain it all in the patisserie.
I' il wait for you from 6: 00 to 7: 00.
Do come!
I adore you.
Ignacio.
Yes?
I miss you.
Have you unpacked all the boxes?
Not even half of them.
Do you need a hand?
I don' t mind, really.
It' s best if you don' t, Martín.
Thanks.
Can I call you later?
I' m reading.
Oh, do forgive me.
Don' t be so fucking touchy!
I' il call you in a while.
Do that, even if it' s late.
We saw Sara' s first films here.
And "Breakfast at Tiffany' s".
Enrique and I groped each other for the first time here.
My knees are trembling just thinking about it.
I' m meeting him at 6: 00 in the patisserie.
Don' t get your hopes up.
Remember, he' s married.
If Father Manolo hadn' t separated us...
What' s he got to do with it?
A lot, everything!
That priest owes me a lot and it' s time for him to pay.
I hate seeing you like this.
You got anything left?
Yes.
What?
Cocaine.
C' mon, let' s have some!
Here?
Of course.
No one' s out in the streets yet.
Oh, fag!
Come on.
A nailful for my gal Paca.
One more.
I believe in couples. two fucks, two bumps, two "amigas"
"Two Rode Together", "Two For The Road".
You' re such a pig!
Right, let' s go to school!
Gee up, girl!
Come on, best foot forward.
This was my school.
I' m worn out.
Do you have anything left?
Be quiet.
It has started.
The god of hope who, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, fills us with His joy and peace...
That' s Father Manolo.
He looks so old!
Well he' s no chicken.
I guess.
Zahara, this is crazy!
Are you backing out, bitch?
No, but the chapel is so tiny, there' s no place to hide.
He drove them out with a whip, and he was Christ!
So this man who, according to you, is so imperfect...
I confess to God, the Father Almighty, and to you, my brethren, that I have sinned through thought, word, deed and omission.
Through my fault.
Through your fault.
Through my fault.
Through your fault.
Through my most grievous fault.
So I beseech the Blessed Mary, ever virgin, the angels, the saints, and you, my brethren, to intercede for me before Our Lord God.
Almighty God, have mercy on us, forgive us our sins and lead us to eternal life.
Through Jesus Christ Our Lord.
We' il see...
The Lord be with you.
I could use Him.
May the blessing of Almighty God,
Father, Son and Holy Spirit descend upon you.
You may go in peace.
I hope so.
Go back to the dormitory and sleep a bit more.
Thank you, Father.
If I' m in the sacristy for too long, don' t wait.
We' il meet at the hostel for lunch, sweetheart.
Cute!
Divine!
Good morning, Father Manolo.
What do you want?
You can' t come in here!
I' m the sister of an ex- pupil, Ignacio Rodríguez.
You still can' t come in here!
Don' t you remember Ignacio?
We' ve had a lot of pupils.
But no one like Ignacio, I' m sure.
I' ve brought an important message from him.
He can give it to me himself.
He can' t.
He died in an accident.
I' m sorry.
Now, please go.
Go away!
Hide!
I' ve got it all!
Hide, he' s coming!
Ignacio...
I told you to leave!
What are you doing here?
The same as you, remembering Ignacio.
Get out!
We have to talk, Father.
It' il only take a minute.
Say what you have to say and go!
Are we going to talk in the dark?
I don' t mind.
I' m used to working in the dark.
What do you want?
A better life and a better body.
What do I have to do with those improvements?
You can help me finance them.
I don' t believe Ignacio is dead or that you' re his sister.
I don' t even believe you' re a woman.
Are you locking me in?
I don' t want anyone coming in by mistake.
And now, tell me why you' re here!
Ok.
I' il get to the point.
It' s a story by Ignacio.
Yes, he took your advice and kept on writing.
I' ve got a friend, a pig, who works at "Diario 16".
He' s very interested in publishing this story.
But first I' d like your opinion.
Apart from being Ignacio' s literature teacher you' re one of the main characters in this story.
Read this.
Each month, the boys who got on the honors board, that is, the ones who got the best grades, were rewarded with a day in the country.
We were always accompanied by our literature teacher,
Father Manolo.
Moon River, always on my mind.
I won' t be swept away by the water, the muddy water of that Moon River as it flows along.
River and moon, tell me where to find my God, and good and ill.
Tell me.
I' m longing to know what is hidden in the dark and you' il find it...
No!
lgnacio!
lgnacio!
A trickle of blood divided my forehead in two.
I had a feeling the same thing would happen with my life.
It would always be divided and I couldn' t help it.
Open the door, Father.
It is I.
What is it?
There' s been a robbery.
Where?
In the chapel.
I think it was after your mass.
Were you missing anything?
No.
The chalice, the paten, the jug, the cruets...
They must be found!
The boys mustn' t hear about this.
Very well.
And no one is to bother me, except you.
Was that Father José?
Ignacio hated him.
Does he still hit the pupils?
He never lad a hand on Ignacio.
That was the principal' s privilege.
To sum up, I want a million in cash.
Or else "Diario 16" will publish the whole story.
I don' t have a million pesetas, much less in cash.
But you can get it.
Now, if you don' t mind, I' m leaving.
I' ve said all I had to say.
But keep reading, it gets better.
The key.
Wait.
Wait until after break time.
It' il just be a minute.
So you came to blackmail me.
Tell Ignacio he' s overrating these pages.
They' re garbage!
Garbage is hot!
You and I make a best- selling couple.
And the editor of "Diario 16" knows that.
You' re in no position to threaten anyone.
People will believe me, not you.
No, people have changed.
This is 1977.
This society puts my freedom above your hypocrisy.
If we treated Ignacio so badly, why did he come back?
Why didn' t he report us or change schools?
He came back 'cause he' d fallen in love, with a classmate.
Enrique Serrano.
Remember him?
Yes.
Do you mind if I keep reading?
There were lots of celebrations at school.
The most important one was Principal' s Day.
That day, there were sports competitions and religious acts, and we had a special meal.
Come with me, Ignacio.
Come along!
I haven' t finished.
You' il sing better that way.
Do you know the new words?
Yes, I' ve got the crib Father Manolo gave me.
Call him Reverend Principal.
I know.
Don' t answer back.
When you' re singing, keep looking at him, as if there were no one else in the dining room.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Father José, placed me in the center of the dining room.
I felt odd in front of all those priests drinking and eating, and I was a bit scared, but they all looked at me kindly, except Father Manolo, who looked ready to cry.
And now,
Father José Manuel, as a birthday gift,
Ignacio is going to sing one of your favorite songs.
"Torna A Sorrento".
The new words, "Gardener", were written by Father José Manuel, helped by my humble self.
When you' re ready, Ignacio.
Gardener, gardener, night and day among your flowers, setting fire to their colors with the flame of your love.
And you place in every calyx the smile of your yearning, with your eyes turned up to heaven where all your hopes reside.
And your flowers, gardener, with their corollas burning brightly join together in gratitude and embalm you with their scent.
Continue with your labor, cultivating all the flowers entrusted to your love by the Lord.
I thought you didn' t like me.
No, just the opposite!
But every time I looked at you, you looked away.
Because you made me nervous.
And now I don' t?
No.
Come in.
May I help you?
Don' t you recognize me, Mother?
Has the world changed me so much?
Mother Soledad!
What are you doing here?
I' ve come to stay.
To stay?
Sara is so beautiful!
In this house?
No.
Never
It' s been a long time.
Who can remember if I did something I shouldn' t have?
It' s impossible.
It is not God who rejects you.
It is I, in the name of my Order.
What' s wrong?
I can' t sleep.
Neither can I.
What we did in the cinema wasn' t right.
I liked it.
So did I.
But I think it was a sin, and God' s going to punish us.
God?
I don' t believe in God.
What do you believe in?
I' m a hedonist.
What' s that?
People who like having fun.
I read it in an encyclopedia.
What' s the matter?
You hear that?
Father Manolo!
Open the door!
Or must I break it down and let the whole school know what you' re doing?
lgnacio!
I know you' re in there!
I' ve seen your feet.
I can hear you breathing.
lgnacio!
We' re not doing anything!
Get out!
I' il deal with you later!
I' m not leaving Ignacio alone with you.
How dare you!
Get out of here immediately!
Enrique, please.
Do as he says.
Come here.
What were you doing in there?
Nothing.
Nothing?
I swear, Father.
Then why was the door locked?
Come along.
Come with me to the chapel.
The bell!
What are you thinking of?
I think I' ve just lost my faith at this moment, so I no longer believe in God or hell.
As I don' t believe in hell I' m not afraid, and without fear I' m capable of anything.
We' il forget this, Ignacio.
Even if I wanted to, I can' t stay angry with you.
But promise that what happened tonight won' t happen again.
And Enrique?
What about him?
Will he be punished?
I should expel him!
I' m sure he was responsible for it all.
No, I was.
Don' t cry.
He' s a very bad influence on you.
I want what' s best for you.
If you don' t expel him I' il do what you want.
Hush.
I sold myself for the first time in that sacristy to avoid Enrique being expelled.
But Father Manolo tricked me.
I swore that one day I' d make him pay for that.
On your feet!
Hands behind your head!
And, one!
Change!
Change!
Change!
Change!
Change!
Change!
Hurry up, Enrique!
We' il miss the bus!
Change!
Change!
I' m happy you came!
You' re better without the beard.
Thank you.
What are you doing?
I' m re- reading your story.
Didn' t you like it the first time?
Of course.
Just look at it.
I couldn' t help making notes.
Force of habit.
That' s Ok, it' s your copy.
Thanks.
Right, well...
How can I put this?
I think there' s a good film in this story and I' d like to direct it.
Really?
You' re not kidding me?
I never joke about work.
But first, tell me how much you want for the rights?
What rights?
The story is yours!
Do what you fucking want with it!
So you really liked it?
I felt a bit apprehensive.
But I was very touched.
I' m so happy, man.
Remember I' m an actor and I want out of Bumblebee.
Yes, I know that.
You' d be perfect as Enrique Serrano, naked on the bed, with Zahara' s letter on the pillow.
¿Enrique Serrano?
I think I' d rather play Zahara.
Zahara, you?
You' re crazy!
Why?
Well...
You' re too well- built.
You' re not right.
Martín, we' ve got our story!
I can slim down!
I can get into the part!
I' m used to that in the theater.
Like Robert De Niro...
Make a photocopy.
"The Visit"?
Yes.
Ignacio and I are starting on the script.
If you' re going to direct it, it' s best if you write it yourself.
All right, Ignacio.
Start calling me Ángel, or you' il never get used to it.
Ángel.
Do you mind driving?
I' m a bit shaky.
I' m surprised you can even walk, with all you' ve taken.
We had to celebrate, right?
I thought we' d be talking about the project.
We' ve got time.
Remember?
Remember what?
Nothing.
You' re really high.
What should I remember?
Nothing.
Turn off here.
Is all this yours?
No, no way.
I' ve just rented it.
Don' t be too impressed, it' s a mess inside.
How about a swim?
It would do you good.
How' s the water?
It' s waiting for you.
Will you pass me a cigarette?
You weren' t serious about playing Zahara, were you?
I don' t joke about work either.
Then let' s not talk about work.
What are you doing?
Sleeping here or going back to Madrid?
If you want, I' il stay.
But talking about bodies, if I look too manly I can slim down.
I' m very flexible, I can do anything.
You disconcert me, Ángel.
You told me that already.
And you told me about slimming down.
Why don' t we just talk clearly?
I can' t say it any more clearly1
I' m an actor.
I spent three fucking years doing shit with Bumblebee.
This is my first chance to get a terrific part and I won' t let it slip away.
You can' t do Zahara.
Not at first sight, but give me time!
You' re a good director, and I' il do anything!
You just have to trust both of us.
I' ve tried.
But I can' t trust you.
Why?
I just can' t recognize the Ignacio I knew at school.
The one who loved "Cuore Matto" and so many other things.
My tastes have changed.
Is that what bothers you?
No.
People change with time.
Not you.
Simply, you' re not Ignacio.
Who the fuck are you to decide who I am or who I' m not?
How dare you?
Why am I not Ignacio?
Because I don' t remember a song from years ago?
Apart from that.
Because I' m not sucking your dick?
If I' d stayed like the kid you knew, I' d be dead now.
I already am.
Dead tired.
I' m going to bed.
What are you doing?
I don' t know.
You tell me.
Tell you what?
If I' m going to play Zahara.
Does your staying depend on that?
No!
But if I don' t play Zahara there' s no film.
Then I don' t know why you' re here, cockteaser.
Get out!
Why the hell did I decide to see you again, fucking faggot!
"A woman threw herself into a pool of hungry crocodiles in a zoo that was crowded with visitors at the time.
When the first crocodile attacked, the woman hugged it, according to the witness.
The crocodiles devoured the body of the woman, who never complained, in a few minutes. "
What a horrible death!
Well...
She didn' t even open her mouth.
What' s on your mind?
Hungry crocodiles.
Hello.
Hello, come in.
It' s the journalist.
Why are you here?
Ton interview me?
No.
Well, yes.
Which is it, cutie?
I' m not a journalist, I' m an actor.
And I' d like you to help me prepare a character.
What character?
A tranny who imitates Sara Montiel, among others.
Why don' t they give me the part?
Well, you' re not an actor, you' re just a faggot.
What you have to learn is how to be polite, because that' s no way to treat a lady!
I' m sorry.
So will you teach me?
And how will you pay me, honey?
That' s what I' m looking for!
Two minutes.
We' il talk later.
I' m on now.
Everything you do is great for me.
I' m delighted.
See you later.
Ortigueira, 6 kilometers.
Hello.
Hello.
What can I get you?
A beer.
Forgive me for asking, but how did you get that lighter?
You' re not from here.
I stole it from a friend.
His family lives here.
Maybe you know him.
His name is Ángel Andrade.
Yes.
That' s his stage name.
Sure, I know him.
You do?
Yes, very well.
That' s great.
Who is it?
Enrique.
I was at school with Ignacio.
Go away or I' il call the police!
Excuse me.
Are you Enrique Goded?
Yes.
I' m Ignacio' s mother.
I' m delighted to meet you.
Come in.
Thank you.
Forgive my sister- in- law.
I' ve got the heart problem, but she' s the one who gets scared.
It doesn' t matter.
We were very good friends.
I know.
The last time he came to see me he wrote you a letter.
A letter?
I never got it.
It was three years ago.
He didn' t know your address, he sent it to the Ministry of Culture.
Then I' m not surprised.
By the time it was returned, he was dead.
Let' s go into the dining room.
That' s my son Juan.
Then younger boy.
He' s in the theater.
He' s changed his name.
He says there are too many Juans.
He wants even me to call him Ángel.
I' d like to see Ignacio' s room.
To be honest, he didn' t really have a room.
But when he came he liked to use the attic.
Would you like to see it?
We' re going upstairs!
Juan burned everything.
The notebooks, the clothes...
All except those magazines.
There' s nothing left of what Ignacio wrote?
No.
What a pity!
Are you from a publisher too?
No.
What publisher?
Soon after Ignacio died, a man came who was in charge of publishing young authors,
Or so he said.
He was desperate to get his hands on Ignacio' s stories.
Do you remember his name, or the publisher' s?
No, but he was very insistent.
So I told the truth, that Juan had burned everything, and he even asked for Juan' s address.
I gave him a false one, of course.
I think that man was half mad.
This is Ignacio' s letter.
It didn' t get burned because I never told Juan it had been returned.
Thank you, ma' am.
Don' t judge my Juan.
He' s a good son, but his brother' s death really hit him.
He was the one who found him.
Dear Enrique.
At last I' ve got news of you.
Even if it was underground.
And to think I was the film buff!
You' il be pleased to hear I' m still writing.
Father Manolo inspired it.
It' s incredible, but I ran into him the other day in Valencia.
I' m visiting my mother now, but I live in Valencia.
I' ve checked up, he isn' t a priest anymore.
He calls himself by his last name, Berenguer.
He works in a publisher' s, he' s married and has a son.
He' s crying out to be blackmailed!
So I wrote "The Visit", the story I' m sending you.
Read it, please.
At this point in my life, I need a lot of money and I' m going to get it from that fucker!
He owes me a lot, and it' s time for him to pay.
Write to me and I' il tell you the rest of the story.
All I' m asking is to hear from you.
I can only share this story with you.
I love you.
Your Ignacio.
I' il get it.
What do you want?
I' ve come to apologize.
I' il give you your shorts.
You left them behind.
Thank you.
I' m very sorry about what I said.
I take it all back.
If you' re still interested, "The Visit" is yours.
Do it with whomever and however you want.
Have you lost weight?
Yes.
I' m really working on it.
I want to lose even more.
And I' m taking classes.
Classes in what?
In how to be a queen.
I' m working with the best Sara Montiel impersonator.
She performs at "Bambola", a gay club.
I' m workin as a waiter there. so I can study the queens more closely.
Then you' re still thinking about Zahara.
Yes.
Just let me do an audition.
Thank you.
You had it!
Yes, you left that behind too.
Ignacio, I' d like to talk...
I won' t believe you' re taking me seriously.
Ángel, I' m sure you' re a good actor, now more than ever.
So you' il let me audition?
The audition worked for several months,
long enough for me to throw myself into the shooting of "The Visit",
like the woman who threw herself to the crocodiles and hugged them as they ate her.
You' ve changed the ending.
Yes.
"The Visit" can' t end happily, like your story.
Why not?
Zahara can' t just walk out of the school.
She' s a threat to the priests.
And we know what the Church is capable of.
But this ending is really heavy, man.
For you, as an actor, it' s much more intresting.
You think so?
Of course.
I shot "The Visit" as a homage to Ignacio.
In his letter, he' d said he' d love to see it on the screen.
And also to discover the enigma of Juan.
He allowed me to penetrate him frequently, but only physically.
We were about to finish shooting and his mystery was still intact.
But on the last day we had a visit.
Silence!
And... roll camera!
Rolling!
"The Visit" 91, 1, first take.
Zahara, darling!
Action!
The boys are in class and I' m sick of arguing.
Let me out!
Do you want to kidnap me?
Open the door!
I have to take a piss, buy cigarettes, get a fix!
Even if I got the money, how can I be sure you won' t blackmail me again?
You' il never be sure.
That' s my revenge.
Let me out or I' il scream.
I loved Ignacio.
You don' t love a boy of ten.
You harass him, you abuse him!
I loved him.
Please, let me out!
I' m locked in!
She' s threatening to denounce us.
She wants a million pesetas to keep quiet.
If you give her a single peseta, you' il never stop paying.
I knew we' d meet again, scum!
You know her?
You knew him much better than I did.
It' s Ignacio Rodríguez.
Ignacio!
It can' t be!
We have to finish him off.
He' s a threat to the whole congregation!
He wants to say something.
Yes, that we let him do.
Confess what?
Thanks to you we' ve got no way out.
You have to stay calm.
I' il get rid of the body.
How?
It' s best if you know nothing.
It was self- defense, Father.
He' d have made our lives impossible.
Yes,
I guess so.
And there are no witnesses.
God.
Yes, but He' s on our side.
Cut!
We' ve cut, guys!
This one' s good.
What about the other one?
1 as well.
Well done, guys.
No, it was great.
Is anything wrong, Ángel?
No.
I' il see you later.
It went really well.
Put that down!
Who are you?
The villain in your film.
Father Manolo!
Mr. Berenguer.
I' m not even a father to my own son now.
Get out!
I read in a magazine that you were here.
Go and drink some hot milk with honey, and take an aspirin, and leave me alone.
I' ve got a lot to do, I can' t waste time on you.
Not even to find out how Ignacio died?
Or who killed him?
And if it concedes with your film?
Say what you have to say and go.
I was living Valencia.
I worked for a publisher that promoted young writers.
Three years ago, I received a story called "The Visit", signed by Ignacio Rodríguez.
Ignacio Rodríguez calling about the new writers anthology.
Didn' t you tell him he was rejected?
Yes, but he insists on speaking to you.
He' s on your line.
Mr. José Manuel Berenguer?
Yes.
I preferred Father Manolo.
Excuse me?
Are you the author of "The Visit"?
Yes.
We decided not to include it in "Short Stories of the 80s"
I' m sorry.
You and I have to talk.
I think not.
I' ve got nothing more to say.
But I do.
I went to St. John' s School.
You were my literature teacher, and you were madly in love with me.
I remember how you' d embrace me from behind while you declared your love.
I can' t believe you' ve forgotten.
I remember the buttons on your sauterne digging into my backbone.
Have you really forgotten?
I' il expect you at my house at 7: 00.
My address is on the back of the envelope, Father Manolo.
Push the door.
It' s just stuck.
That wasn' t the Ignacio you and I loved.
Hello, Mr. Berenguer.
I' m Ignacio.
Please, come in.
Yes, I' m a junkie, but I want to quit and I thought you could help me.
Well, I know a clinic.
So do I, but first I want to fix myself up a bit.
I know I' ve got divine tits, but everything else...
Anyway, I won' t get into that.
Looking pretty costs a lot of money, Father Manolo.
I think a million would do it.
A million?
Yes, in cash, and my lips are sealed.
I won' t say a word.
You' re out of your mind!
Sexual harassment is frowned upon, Father Manolo.
What would your wife think, or your boss?
You' re in no position to blackmail anyone.
I could have you arrested tonight.
Very well.
You call the police, I' il call your wife and the media.
A blackmailer can' t be as defenseless as you are.
Believe me, I know what I' m saying.
Juan, go back to your room.
I want to watch TV.
Watch it later, we' re talking business.
I don' t mind if he stays.
I' m sure you don' t.
He' s my brother, he' s looking after me.
Or that' s my mother' s idea.
I' m Mr. Berenguer.
One million, end of story.
Do you want me to call him Juan, or Ángel?
The blackmail became an investment for me.
I visited the brothers frequently so I could keep seeing Juan.
Remember Don Narciso, the Nazi?
He love my illustrations.
Look at this one.
And there' s another one...
Look, this is beautiful.
And this one...
"Children of Spain"
I brought you this.
I kept Ignacio happy with small amounts of money.
And I kept stalling him.
I desired Juan, more and more every day.
Hello.
Hello.
You brought the dough?
I can only give you 50, 000.
You said you' d bring the million!
I said they' d tell me today if I' d get the loan.
They said yes, but they have to check my guarantees.
I need another three weeks.
Another three weeks!
I' m a junkie.
Haven' t you noticed?
I could be dead in three weeks.
Are you going away?
Obviously!
I want to see my mother before I check in.
She has to see me with these teeth and this face, and it' s your fault!
Don' t be unfair, Ignacio, I' m doing what I can.
Then do more!
I' il be gone for a week.
When I come back I want that million.
If you don' t have it, you' il be sorry.
I' m sick of being put off!
I' il try to hurry them up, but...
Father.
Come along.
Shall I help you?
Sure, take the Olivetti, it' s the heaviest.
While you' re at it, take this one too.
Taxi.
Bye, Father.
Goodbye.
Open the trunk, please.
My scarf!
Excuse me.
I' ve come for my scarf.
I must have left it here.
Fuck, it' s really soft!
Silk.
It' s yours.
To be honest, I left it here for you.
Cut it out, I' m not Ignacio!
Fortunately.
What time is it?
12: 30.
Did he give you anything for me?
Ignacio?
No.
Fuck!
I had to pay my school fees today.
Are you studying?
Yes.
Drama.
I' m an actor.
Selfish bastard!
He knew I had to pay today and he didn' t give me anything.
Obviously, I paid his fees.
I hadn' t told Ignacio but the bank had granted me a loan of two million.
I withdrew the first million.
I told my wife I was going to a conference abroad.
She didn' t believe me.
I guess that doesn' t interest you.
Not in the least.
How did Ignacio die?
The week Juan and I spent alone was the happiest in my life.
Every day I bought him something.
Clothes, a walkman, a Super- 8 camera.
I enjoyed the gifts more than he did.
Take off your shirt.
Take it off!
Now it' s my turn!
Now, take that off.
Show me your cock.
If you' re going to shoot my dick, don' t show my face!
Too late.
I can' t...!
You!
Give me some dough!
I' ve got the fucking sweats.
How' s mom?
She had another heart attack.
But she' s all right now.
I' m the one who' s sick.
The dough!
More!
That' s all I have.
I want that million now!
No more excuses!
No more stalling and no more gifts.
Mom!
How are you, Juan?
Has Ignacio arrived?
Yes! what happened this time?
The usual thing, son, but...
He stole my pension, and I' d just gotten it!
Is that true?
Yes, love, it is.
Tell auntie I' il send her some money.
He promised me he was going into a clinic.
And you believed him?
Yes, this time he really means it.
He' s going to try.
You have to help him.
How?
By being with him.
Don' t leave him.
I promise.
Listen, did he give you the cheese and the chorizos?
Delicous!
Why did you bother?
There' s food in Valencia.
Don' t spend your money.
They' re your favorites.
I' d kept them for you.
You can' t get them in Valencia.
All right, thanks.
Lots of love, son.
Yes, call me if anything happens.
Don' t worry, I will.
Bye.
Where' s Ignacio?
I' m going to kill him!
It was Juan' s idea.
Or mine, I don' t know.
The only solution was to get rid of him.
More or less what you' ve just shot.
But not as violent.
How did you think of it?
Ignacio' s story doesn' t end like that.
While I was adapting it, I found out that Ignacio was dead.
Did Juan tell you?
No.
I found out myself.
Will you just tell me how it happened?
I arranged to meet Juan at the Museum of Giant Figures.
He had it all planned out.
Much more than it seemed at first.
I' il buy the junk and you give it to him.
Why me?
Fuck, he' s my brother!
I' m not a monster.
Do you think this doesn' t hurt me?
But he' s ruining all our lives.
What will we do afterwards?
We won' t meet for a while.
Why?
You said there' d be no investigation.
Just in case.
It' s best not to arouse suspicion.
I' il go and look after my mother, she' il need it.
When things calm down, I' il call you and we' il go away.
Have you got the money?
Yes.
No.
What will I do while I' m waiting?
Work, earn money.
We' il need it.
The situation at home is unbearable.
Apologize to your wife and enjoy your son.
Tell her the truth.
What?
Say you' ve been with someone else, a woman.
Give me your mother' s address.
It' s best if I don' t.
Then you won' t be tempted to come see me.
What are they laughing at?
They' re laughing at us.
At me, at least.
Juan bought deadly pure heroin.
He gave it to me and I went to Ignacio' s.
Alone.
This is my last fix.
What do you mean?
I' m quitting.
This time I really am.
Before I get my face and all the rest done,
I' m checking into a detox clinic.
I' ve already applied.
Good.
You' il have the money tomorrow.
I hope so.
Before noon, Ok?
Just in case, I wrote two letters, one for the publisher and the other for your wife, telling all you' ve hidden from them in the past and present.
That' s unnecessary.
Give them to me!
When I get the money.
Before noon.
Pretty, aren' t they?
What?
My tits.
Yes, they' re wonderful.
Thank you.
Shall I help you?
No, no.
Go away.
I don' t like fixing in front of you.
It' s done.
Pull in here.
We' il go to the cinema to kill time.
It' s as if all the films were talking about us.
Now what?
I' m going home.
You want me to go with you?
No, you' d better not.
Remember to get those two letters.
Yes.
If you don' t we' il be in trouble.
I' il get everything don' t worry.
If we won' t be seeing each other for a while, give me some of the Super- 8s.
It would console me to see us screwing.
You' re nuts!
What if your wife saw them?
We have to burn them.
I' il take care of that.
Let' s go.
Get in for a minute.
No, I' m going to take a taxi.
I won' t see you again?
It' s just for a few days.
Call me as soon as you can.
Yes.
Ignacio?
Enrique.
What' s wrong?
You!
At last!
I read in this film magazine that you were here.
What did you tell him?
Everything.
Now you only have me, darling.
You' re crazy.
Remember I' ve got my brother' s letters, accusing you of his death.
We both did it, my love.
The letters only mention you.
Enrique, wait!
Enrique.
Are you all right?
Leave me alone!
If I ever see you again, I swear I' il kill you!
Now that I' ve found you, I won' t let you go.
Get used to the idea.
Mónica.
Can you give me a lift?
Sure.
Yes?
Get in the front.
Hello.
Who was that?
Someone looking for Enrique.
Who is it?
It' s me.
Give me back the keys.
Your things are in the hall.
Take them away.
The taxi' s gone.
You' il have to lend me the car or drive me back to Madrid.
I want to order a taxi.
11, Avenida del Aqua.
Enrique Goded, yes.
Thank you.
I was going to tell you after the shoot.
Tell me what?
That my name is Juan.
That I' m Ignacio' s brother and Ignacio died four years ago.
I knew that already.
I know that you knew.
What do you mean?
My mother rang to tell me you' d been to the house.
I guessed you' d learned everything.
When you asked for the audition, you knew that I knew?
Yes.
And you still kept pretending?
What else could I do?
I didn' t lie you knew everything.
No, I didn' t, far from it.
I knew you' d taken Ignacio' s place and that he was dead, but I never imagined that you' d killed him!
That' s the taxi.
I didn' t kill him, Berenguer did!
Ignacio was blackmailing him.
And you were hustling him!
The taxi' s waiting.
You don' t know what it is like to have a brother like that and live in a small town.
Juan, the taxi is waiting.
Why did you choose me?
You still don' t see me as Zahara.
Was it just to fuck me?
It was curiosity.
I wanted to see how far you would go and how much I could take.
I would go a lot further.
I bet you would.
You needn' t explain any more.
It' s not mine.
It' s from Ignacio.
I think I' ve succeeded...

Numbers:
Top drawer, left side, all you have to do is sign off on them.
You see, that' s why I' m the boss, Kallen.
Because I let you handle things for me.
I would send myself roses.
Well, roses die and you might be allergic, but thanks for thinking of you.
LaRocca' s event briefing, where do you want that?
In the conference room.
And don' t stick the cutout in the corner.
It' s my handiwork.
Put it someplace Sammy can see.
All right?
I hate it.
I hate it a lot.
Are these guys gonna fight or foxtrot?
They look like Homo sapiens or something.
They are Homo sapiens,
Kallen speaks.
And from a mile away.
- Am I contagious or something?
- No, it' s not a hygienic thing.
She just gets kind of shy around you.
I' m sorry you' re unhappy with the standee, but we only went with the shot because your guys approved it.
If I say the shit' s shit, it' s shit.
I mean, they told me that you signed off on it, Sammy.
I don' t know what the hell happened.
Jackie, what happened?
I don' t care what happened.
You have 48 hours before the fight.
I want the two faggots fixed.
I mean, who the hell does Sam LaRocca think he is?
- A made man, that' s who.
- No, he is the antichrist.
With a bank account.
He is this.
An $80 shoe?
He is the gum on the bottom of my shoe.
That' s what Abel and LaRocca are.
They' re the gum, you' re the shoe.
How come they walk all over you?
Get a little older, work a little longer, you won' t be so judgmental then.
You think I like working for idiots who take advantage of me?
That' s easy for you to say.
This is not the best job you ever had.
At least here I get to see boxing, in person, for free.
Boxing makes all the other shit bearable.
I' d be the first in line to bend over so LaRocca and Abel could kiss my ass.
OK, don' t get upset with me just because you know that I know how smart you are.
So now you think smart is all there is to it?
That your brain can just plot the best course and your life just goes there?
The world is not an oyster.
It is a smelly tank full of dirty water and sharks.
It is not that easy to swim.
Jackie, you need to get real about where you are, which is stuck.
In the basement.
You can' t even see the glass ceiling from here.
Find an elevator, press some buttons.
At least the only way out is up.
Yo, Tyrell, wait up!
Clean towels, we need more clean towels.
Bad break, Rex.
Bad break?
I won that fight.
Come on, you saw it.
Everybody saw it.
You would' ve won if you hadn' t run out of gas.
You train serious, you could have a career.
I would' ve given you a draw.
You deserved a draw.
He looks like shit.
Day- old shit.
If day- old shit shook like an AK- 47.
Shut up!
You can' t say dick that wouldn' t piss me off more.
It' s all good.
Mr. LaRocca, it' s adrenaline.
Shakes don' t mean nothing.
Ask my last 12 wins.
- Hey, Jackie.
- Hey, Devon.
I' m only interested in the 13th.
Lose tonight and you' il be waving bye- bye to your career, your fan club and the free hoochie mamas that go with it.
What are you selling?
Sorry to interrupt, but it' s showtime.
Let' s get out of here.
Come on, you can do this.
Let' s do this.
Get your hands up, you bum!
He' s got no left hand.
What' s going on?
What' s the story with Greene?
Pedro!
Pedro!
Pedro!
Pedro!
Pedro!
Get off the ropes!
OK, OK.
That' s it.
That' s it.
- Forget this guy Greene.
- Yeah.
No more, no more.
He' s dead.
That' s a kaput.
No, he' s good.
It' s like he didn' t bother to show up.
Trust me, he' s dead.
And if I know Sammy, he already wrote the obituary.
- See you, Gavin.
- See you.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
Jacqueline.
I' d offer a seat, but I don' t think anyone would get up.
- Thirsty?
- Let me buy you a drink.
Bowie, hi.
Can I get a wine cooler and whatever Gavin' s drinking whenever he' s ready?
- All right.
- Like that dress.
- The cleaner' s shrunk it.
- I' il send a thank- you note.
Did you get that fax on Needles' demos?
They' re good.
Put him on your show.
He' s exactly what your advertisers want.
- Do we have to do this now?
- Do what, talk?
We' re not talking.
You' re negotiating.
Stop it.
Listen, if I was a man trying to close a deal, you wouldn' t say that.
Oh, please.
Don' t throw sex in my face.
- Unless you mean it.
- You see how you are?
I can' t have a regular conversation with you.
You' re afraid to have a regular conversation with me.
Oh, right.
You' re Mr. Irresistible.
I wish.
Kallen!
Come here.
Come here!
I gotta go.
There it is.
For the pride of Puerto Rico.
Promise me you' il wear this for the championship bout.
Promise me you' il wear this for the championship bout.
- Here we go.
- Oh, yeah!
Kallen.
Good.
J. Lo' s coming to the Coliseum next month.
I want me and Pedro front and center.
- Front and center?
Consider it done.
- Done and done.
- Hey, shouldn' t you have that on ice?
- What are you, a doctor?
No, the doctors are busy stitching up Greene.
Unprofessional pussy didn' t even bother to give the fans a decent fight, nothing.
Screw him.
He' s a Polaroid.
He' s out of the picture.
Pedro, I' m a man who hates defeat, but I' m not too proud to be candid.
You won because you worked and Greene didn' t.
He' s a lazy- ass fighter, and lazy- ass always loses.
That' s a fact.
Right, half- pint?
Well, I' m...
I' m not sure why Devon lost.
Maybe he just felt insecure about his corner.
You know, boxing is a team sport.
If a boxer doesn' t feel support in his corner, sometimes it comes out in the ring.
Listen to the Barbie doll with the glass balls.
What do you know about support?
What do you know about boxing?
Executive assistant.
You wipe lrv Abel' s ass for a living.
I cover lrv Abel' s ass for a living.
And I know as much about boxing as either of you.
What' s that mean?
- Nothing.
Forget it.
- Forget it?
You talk like you think you can do what I do.
What' s the point in thinking that?
I don' t have a boxer.
Do you think you can do what I do?
- Possibly, if given a chance.
- A chance?
That' s all you need?
- Yeah, probably.
- Greene' s contract.
It' s yours.
- Sure it is.
- Hey!
You don' t want it?
- I can' t afford it.
- You can' t afford it.
I' il make it easy.
- It' s yours for a dollar.
- I don' t have a dollar.
I' il lend you a dollar.
I tell you what, half- pint.
I' m gonna forget what you said since you don' t know what you' re talking about.
Because if you did, you' d know it don' t pay to shoot your mouth off at me.
I just bought a boxer for a buck.
I think it pays pretty well, Sam.
I' m not keeping him.
I' m not keeping Greene.
It was a thing that became a thing.
LaRocca insulted me.
So what?
Sammy insults everybody.
You' re gonna call him, make up, kiss his ass if you have to.
If anybody asks about Greene, it was a joke, a little parlor trick that you and Sammy played.
You lost your temper, you said a few ridiculous things.
You set it right.
It' il blow over.
Sammy won' t think you' re trying to grow a brain on me.
It wasn' t ridiculous, what I said.
And you shouldn' t be drinking that coffee.
Welcome back to the live weekend edition of the Reese Report,
Fight fan or feminist, you' re going to love this story,
After watching Devon Greene crawl off the canvas, fight promoter Sam LaRocca managed to lose his boxer and his ego in a round of verbal sparring with Coliseum employee Jackie Kallen,
LaRocca thought he had Kallen in the corner, but she outmaneuvered him and wound up walking away with Greene' s contract,
The price tag?
A dollar,
That' s platinum stuff,
You couldn' t write a check big enough for the look on LaRocca' s face,
It was priceless, and I enjoyed it for free,
Renee, it' s me.
Quick.
Turn on Channel 28.
I' m on TV!
Hey, Sam, do you know what a coup d' etat is?
Look it up,
I' m Gavin Reese for the Reese Report, See you next week,
Girl, what the hell happened to all his money?
I didn' t have a chance to ask.
His phone' s disconnected, so I had to come.
I got here, I was fine, and then I wasn' t fine.
So you called me for blackup.
Like I need Gangster lncorporated in my life.
Like LaRocca is gonna let you waltz off with his boxer.
Like any of this makes any sense.
I' m more scared not to do this than to do it.
Devon is a ranked boxer.
God practically dropped him in my lap.
How can I walk away?
I might as well spit in the face of destiny.
Now he' s your destiny?
Devon, are you in there?
It' s Jackie Kallen.
We tried.
We failed.
Let' s go.
Wait, wait, I hear something.
He' s unlocking the door.
He' s home.
Devon, did you know your phone' s not work...?
You know Stormy.
This ain' t no double date.
Get the shit.
We don' t have any shit.
- Then why' d you page me?
- We didn' t.
- Why?
- Devon, it' s me.
It' s Jackie from the arena.
We just...
Anyway, we came by to say hey.
And you' re busy, so we' il come back.
You bitches ain' t going nowhere till we get our rock!
Give my man your bag!
There' s just enough tokens in there for my laundry.
- That' s all I have with me...
- A dollar bill, maybe.
What am I, a punk?
A chump?
You can just smoke T. J. 's shit like it' s a gift?
Man, come here!
Man, you done messed up my high.
Come on, Jackie, let' s go!
Let' s go!
Let' s go!
Let' s go!
- I' m sorry.
- I don' t forgive you.
"Where' s my rock, bitches?"
What about that guy, the way he waxed the floor with both their asses?
- That was off the hook!
- Honey, no.
He was a thug who out- thugged another thug.
A thug- and- a- half if you count your boy Devon, who is pathetic, Jackie!
His contract only cost a dollar.
You still overpaid!
- Call me later.
- I' m sorry.
You better be.
I' m going to see my cousin Malik.
I don' t know why you mess with me, all these criminals out here, man.
Oh, hey, Luther Shaw.
Jackie Kallen.
I bailed you out.
- I know you?
- No, no.
Not exactly.
Listen.
Do you have a minute for a cup of coffee, a beer?
- How about a milk shake?
- A milk shake?
Yeah.
Yeah, whatever you drink.
Listen, I know this is unusual.
Believe me, I don' t make a habit of bailing strangers out of jail.
That would make me a nut, a broke nut.
And I' m not.
I' m not nutty.
I' m just a person taking a chance.
You might be interested in who I am and what I have to say.
If you' re not, I totally understand.
You don' t owe me a thing.
If, on the other hand, you are, my car' s parked around the corner.
I' m harmless.
Really.
Really, the worst I could give you is a ride.
It was brutal, you know, it was beautiful the way you fought.
Yeah.
You boxed.
You had some training, you won some amateur bouts.
- You were good...
- Do you always talk like this?
- Like what?
- Too much?
- Actually, people have said...
- That' s a yes.
Know what, pull over right here.
- Right here.
Pull over right here.
- OK, Luther.
This shit you' re talking is crazy.
I think you' re crazy.
You gotta be.
Hanging with crackhead Devon.
I wasn' t hanging with him.
I came to see...
Look, I didn' t know he was doing crack, OK?
It' s sad.
Another black man bites the dust.
Thanks for the bail, bitch.
- Jackie!
- What' s up?
My name is Jackie!
Crazy broad.
What' s happening?
Now, Luth, we ain' t saying that you ain' t bad.
We know that, but don' t be selling us some bullshit, because you know you ain' t mopped the floor with no Devon Greene.
I' m telling you, man, I gave that fool an old- fashioned, project ass- whupping.
I' m telling you, his partner tried to get brave and sneak me.
I had to dust his ass off too.
- You still here?
- Yeah.
- Go home.
- I can' t.
You didn' t let me finish.
- Following him and shit.
- What' s up with that?
A little uptown piece.
I know.
It must seem a little out there.
All right, way out there.
But that is where all the good stuff is, Luther.
Like talent, and you...... you' re talented.
So this chance you call yourself taking, why you taking it on me?
Because I' ve been around boxing my whole life.
I know it like the back of my hand.
I know potential, and I see it in you.
I do, Luther.
- I got potential?
- Yeah.
- Watch out, world.
- Don' t laugh at me.
All right?
I' m serious.
If you took me serious, we could be driving Jags and sporting Versace.
You' re a woman.
And you' re white.
- Say it like I' m a disease.
- In the fight game, you are.
- Say it like I' m a disease.
- In the fight game, you are.
I' m not saying it would be easy.
But I' m used to hard.
I am.
OK?
How do you want to do this?
Do you want to work together?
You want to make a deal?
- Make a deal?
- Yeah.
You never managed nobody in your whole life.
How you gonna front me, you can' t front yourself?
You' re nine- to- fiving it.
You' re driving a damn Honda.
I have some savings, I' il do a budget.
I' m good with budgets.
And I' m really good with people.
I can read them.
And I can read you, Luther, and I know you want to do this.
Maybe I' m interested.
Maybe I' il call you.
Maybe I won' t.
You' re the one that' s gonna have to wait and see.
When you pay your tickets, you can register your vehicle.
Basically, it' s what you call an "all there is to it" situation.
Mister, when you pay your tickets, you can register...
- Hey, Felix.
- Next!
Jackie Kallen.
We spoke on the phone.
I remembered you, you didn' t remember me.
Remember?
Hey, Cynthia, I' m breaking.
So you say this boy is good, huh?
Well, good is a dime a dozen.
Oh, no, he' s better than good.
He' s the bomb.
And you' re the best.
You' ve turned more chumps into champs than Eddie Futch.
I got out of the game for a reason, you know.
Yeah, I know you had a stroke in '96.
I was sorry to hear about that.
The stroke didn' t do nothing but clear my head.
Look, I ain' t got time to waste training no cash registers in it for the money.
That' s a wonderful sentiment, and I totally agree.
Although ultimately, boxing is a business.
It' s a sport first.
You know, learn your craft, pay your dues.
Money will come, and it will go.
That' s why they call it "cash flow".
Felix, this kid reminds me of Marvin Hagler.
It' s just nonstop punches.
He is the real deal.
I wouldn' t have troubled you otherwise.
Ray- Ray Kallen' s niece.
All right.
I' il take a meet.
Felix.
Luther may just...
He may be just a... tiny bit raw.
Well, raw' s workable.
Rotten isn' t.
Look, Felix, I don' t know what to tell you.
- Hey, Felix, it' s traffic, it' s rush hour.
- Yes.
This time every day.
Hey, Luther!
There he is.
Felix Reynolds.
This tired- ass old man is gonna be my trainer.
Lady, I thought you said you had a plan.
Let me see your stance.
He ain' t worth it.
- Oh, well.
- Next?
Hey, do you see a line anywhere?
You stop being a brat and apologize.
A brat?
What' s that supposed to mean?
Whatever it takes to get him back.
He is it.
Hey, Felix!
Now, Luther has something to say to you.
- Luther.
- Hey.
Look, old man, hold up.
No disrespect intended, but what have you done?
Who have you trained?
Let' s hear some actual ring experience.
You first.
Was I right or what?
Yeah, he packs a helluva punch like you said.
Combinations need tightening.
They' re all over.
But he' s strong, got a great feint, and he' s a southpaw like Hagler.
He could make some noise in the middleweight division.
All right.
Time, boys.
Well, if he can learn to be a switch hitter, fight from the right- hand stance as well as the left,
- he could surprise some people.
- Left, right, whatever.
- It was all right?
- It was better than all right.
But you gotta get in shape, you gotta get in boxing shape, right?
Yeah, your body' s strong.
Your mind...... gonna need a whole lot of discipline.
Ain' t nothing wrong with my mind.
The ring.
Get it at 5: 00.
Oh, no, I don' t get off of work till 6.
In the morning.
Is it cheaper?
No.
It' s available.
Five o' clock in the morning?
Man, you can forget that.
You gotta leave some room for sleep.
Haven' t you slept enough, son?
In three years, I pay you 2...
Luther?
Listen.
Three years, 250 a week, then I recoup that amount from your winnings.
After that, after we start making a profit, you take the lion' s share, I get 33 and a third.
What you think, Felix?
You heard what the lawyer said.
She' s assuming all the risks.
She' s making an investment in you.
Well, she ain' t got to worry.
You bring it all on.
I' m gonna squash whatever you send my way.
Lady, that' s the best I can do.
A grand for all that gold?
Are you nuts?
It' s worth three times more than that.
Worth ain' t the way it works.
What about fair?
Does fair work?
No?
OK.
OK, what about this?
You give me 1, 250, I throw that in for free.
1, 250.
Please don' t screw me beyond that point.
I have kids.
How are you doing?
How the hell you been?
How you been?
Hey, Luth, look here.
This here is Kevin Keyes, the best cutman in the business.
- Good to meet you.
- How you doing?
This is Cedric Mouketendi, your sparring partner.
- Mouke what?
- Mouketendi.
It' s Ugandan.
Call me Rick.
It' s easier.
I' m gonna take you out, Africa.
Monkey' s ass always talks shit.
Off the ropes!
Off the ropes!
Come on, spin out of there, now!
Time!
Time.
Time.
Now you see what the hell I' m telling you about your jab?
Stop street fighting.
When he misses, counterpunch him.
- His rhythm' s great.
- It ain' t his rhythm I' m worried about.
In a minute, when I say again.
I put him in with a bigger man so he' d learn how to move.
- Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Luther!
- Luther!
- Hey!
Come on!
Come on, now.
Come on.
Boy, you wanna fight like a damn hoodlum?
I' il toss your black ass back out on the street!
You think I' m playing with you?
I ain' t playing with you, boy!
Hey, Luther, look at me.
Look, look.
You can' t win if you fight dirty, do you understand that?
- You all right, son?
- Yeah, I' m all right.
- He' s here to help you.
- Sorry, it won' t happen again.
Will it?
- Won' t happen again.
- Say it like we can hear it!
It won' t happen again!
Hey.
I don' t want any threatening or yelling.
That is not helping him.
Yeah, well, I' m trying to teach the boy how not to use his fists.
What do you suggest?
Handcuffs?
Whatever happened to this dude?
Your uncle Ray- Ray.
He died about a year after that was taken.
Hey, I' il start a scrapbook for you as soon as we get our first fight.
So did your dad start you in boxing?
No.
Counselor, juvenile hall.
In your lap.
And your dad?
May he rest in peace.
And your mom?
Who the hell knows, man?
Do you have any brothers and sisters?
I got a brother named Michael in Philly.
He' s a year older.
Stupid- ass Social Services.
They separated us, so we grew up apart.
I see him when I see him.
It' s no big deal.
I thought we were gonna be straight.
I' m being straight with you.
Who were you beating up today in the gym?
It wasn' t Mouketendi.
- I lost my temper.
- You found your temper.
What you lost is the rest of you.
Look, I go off sometimes, all right?
It' s just how I am.
It' s not a problem.
Yeah?
The problem you don' t have already got in your way, and you haven' t thrown a punch in a pro fight.
I mean, don' t you wanna win, Luther?
I wanna win.
You know, you got all these expectations.
What are you gonna do if this don' t work out?
It' il work out, Luther.
You just have to let yourself trust me.
I am not the enemy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up, old man, I ain' t into no S & M stuff.
Who do you think you is?
Marvelous Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Robinson?
You another young wannabe fighter, come a dime a dozen, trying to look pretty.
Start with the basics.
I' il tie down your right arm so you can learn to throw a left.
You gotta learn to be balanced on both sides.
Fight somebody that know how to handle a southpaw, better be ready to show him something different.
Now snap out that jab.
Let me see it.
5: 00' s the best I can do.
I need your locker dues.
- OK, coach.
- Come get it.
You know there' s a powder for that.
Six- thirty is open.
I want a 6: 30.
Yeah, and I want a blowjob every hour on the hour.
Is that why you' re acting like such a dick?
All right, dig it in, that' s right, dig it in.
Now jab him out.
Jab him.
To the body, to the body, to the body.
Combination.
All right, push him off, push him off, push off.
Jump right back on him.
Now, Kallen and this amateur monkey she scraped off the street, Shaw, you said they were nothing.
- That ain' t what I hear.
- It was, Sam.
He' s been training with Reynolds.
He' s been kicking the shit out of some guys in the gym.
That bitch does not find a fight in this town, or nowhere near it.
Ever.
Make it understood.
Anybody puts Kallen' s boy on a card puts his own ass out of business.
Shaw.
Luther Shaw.
S- H- A- W.
Just because you never heard of him, he can' t be phenomenal?
No, you can' t call me back.
No, it' s his manager.
Yeah, I' m a woman.
No.
I haven' t thought about strapping one on, mister.
Have you?
Well, I think you have a really nice voice too.
I do.
But I can' t cash those compliments at a bank.
I don' t need a date.
What I really need is a fight for my boxer.
Jackie Kallen for Crisco Cohen.
No, he does know who I am.
Did you hear me?
I' ve known him since we were kids,
How many times do I have to say this?
Are you listening?
Now put your hands together and give a warm Buffalo welcome
- All right, baby. - to our trio of precious gems,
Ruby, Emerald and Sapphire,
All that plastic.
It' s a wonder she doesn' t melt in that spotlight.
Crisco, it' s me, Jackie Kallen.
What the hell are you doing here?
I got a boxer.
You drove 200 miles to tell me that?
You couldn' t pick up the phone?
I did.
Four times.
Hey, I' m a businessman.
Yours ain' t the only number I gotta call.
How' s Judy?
I have never cheated on her.
I just come to these joints for relaxation.
I remember that, Crisco.
How do you think I found you?
- It took me a while, but I found you.
- Yeah, well...
Great.
What are you...?
- Well...
- You got a boxer?
Good luck.
100 men ahead of you manage for a living.
- I never even heard of your guy.
- Luther Shaw.
Put him on an undercard.
See what he can do.
Hey.
We' il never get a fight in the Midwest as long as Sam LaRocca lives and breathes.
Too bad.
I can' t believe you have the nerve to shirk me off.
My father taught you everything you' il ever know.
Pete Kallen is the only reason you are where you are today.
Pete would spin in his grave if he could see what you' re doing.
Look, stick to what you know.
You' re a secretary, for chrissake.
And you' re a married man addicted to strip joints and God knows what else.
I am sure I could find out.
- What, are you threatening me now?
I' m thanking you in advance because I know that you' re gonna help me the same way my dad helped you.
Yeah, UUF.
UUF?
What the hell is that?
- Ulterior Uterine Fibrosis.
- Oh, UUF.
- It' s a venereal disease.
- No.
It' s a female disease.
There' s nothing venereal about it.
It' s still difficult to discuss.
Yeah, privates are tough to talk about.
Most women would' ve made something up.
I' il probably only need a few days sick leave because the procedure I' m having, it' s really just minor surgery.
That' s good.
Where is the operation?
I' il probably just have it in my doctor' s office downtown.
Well, that' s a little out of the way, isn' t it?
Unless you mean downtown Buffalo.
How long am I in this business?
Long enough.
Nothing goes behind my back.
What did you think?
It wouldn' t get back to me?
Well, how can I think?
I don' t have a brain.
You also don' t have a job now unless you stop with this silly extracurricular bullshit.
Now, you will stop, or I' il fire your ass.
And you' il lose your pension, your benefits, everything I let you work for.
Trust me, Kallen, you don' t want this kind of kaput.
I' d rather have that kind of kaput than your kind of stupid.
And remember, use your jab.
- Nervous?
- Why I gotta be nervous?
That' s good.
Use the energy, Luther.
This guy' s all that stands in your way of the next guy.
You knock him down.
Knock him out.
Oh, gotta get our picture.
OK, fighters only.
And get the three of us in and make this great.
OK, just this once.
Jab.
Jab him.
Jab.
Stay on him.
Don' t let him tie you up.
- Get rough with him.
- Let him go.
Let him go.
All right, stick that jab out there.
Hands up, hands up.
- You threw a punk shot!
- Got him!
One, two, three, four, five, six.
It' s over!
Yeah!
That was beautiful.
That was beautiful.
Nice work on the jab.
Did you see that right hook, Felix?
Did you see that?
That was great.
Yeah, he did all right.
Hold on, hold on.
One second.
Listen.
Whoever it is, nobody act surprised that we won.
OK?
Hey.
Oh, hey, guys, this is Crisco Cohen.
Oh, hey, my girl' s homeboy.
The one that put us on the card.
Oh, hey, my girl' s homeboy.
The one that put us on the card.
- Jackie said you weren' t coming.
- Jackie says things.
I' m a promoter.
Promoters show up.
We don' t read punches in the paper.
- Nice fight.
Congratulations.
- Thanks.
- How you doing?
Felix Reynolds.
- Sorry, Felix.
I didn' t know you were back.
- Very nice job tonight.
- Thank you.
KO.
Just like I said.
Better than good.
Listen, Luther, we got to talk your next fight now.
- Great.
Hey, wait a minute.
What are you doing?
You talk to me.
He boxes.
I book.
Yeah.
We need local exposure.
You need an A- plus story.
I' m handing you one, exclusively.
It' s not algebra, Gavin.
Jackie, you against LaRocca makes a great, quaint anecdote.
Don' t make a mission out of it.
So, what, you' re trying so hard not to say is that it' s a man' s world?
I don' t have to say it.
You know it.
You have a love for the sport...
But I should worship from afar.
God forbid I use anything from the neck up.
He has to win a few more fights.
He has to climb up the card before I hot- dog him.
- One more fight.
- What' s your rush?
Well, I got fired.
Or maybe I quit.
As if you didn' t know.
The point is, I can' t wait for you to decide if Luther is newsworthy.
He is.
Luther Shaw weighs in at...... 159 pounds on the dot.
Here you go.
They get on the scale thirsty.
They get off even thirstier.
- He' s heavier since Buffalo.
- Yeah, he' s stronger.
Your guy looks pretty good too.
Thank you so much.
Don' t drink that.
Don' t even smell it.
I' m serious.
I' il get you another one.
Hey there, Mathias.
Hi.
Listen, I saw your last fight, and wow.
That was one beautiful left hook.
Oh, oh, sorry.
Oh, thanks.
I just wanted to say may the best man win.
No hard feelings, no matter what happens.
No.
Stay back.
He don' t like it down there.
He don' t like it down there.
Nice jab.
Good jab.
Luther, go back to the body.
Jump on him, that' s right.
Get up on him.
Hit him hard.
Beautiful jab.
Break clean.
Come on.
You OK, Mathias?
- He don' t wanna fight no more?
- Turn around and box.
Can you continue, Mathias?
Do you want to box?
- All right.
- It' s over.
Way to go to the body, huh?
That felt good.
- That' s the way to work downtown.
- What happened?
- Easy, take it easy, easy.
- Get them off.
Get them off!
Oh, kid.
Thanks.
OK, well, that' s my job...... to see shit coming.
Break it up.
Neutral corner.
Four or five more miles.
If you grab my hand, I' m going to bring you up the hill.
Come on, keep turning.
Get on the inside and turn.
Get back.
One...
- Sounds like things are going great.
- Oh, better than great.
Terrific.
It' s over.
No.
No?
Why?
All right, no elevator, but the rooms are huge.
Electric' s included.
The fireplace burns real wood.
Open this thing on the top before you light a fire.
It' s called a flue.
Don' t ask me why.
What do you think?
Tell you, the place is tight.
I think I like it.
You know, I hope I can afford it.
It' s all about balancing your checkbook.
Did you fill out those bank applications I gave you?
Oh, I don' t know.
I don' t even remember what I did with those.
This is the lease agreement for you to look over.
It' s the usual, first and last.
And I got you an extension on your tax returns, but get it in next week.
Envelopes, stamps, stationery, all in here.
So how come you don' t have any kids?
It just never came up, the opportunity.
It could still, later.
I guess.
I think that you would be dope as a mom.
Oh, thanks.
Luther, I think you' re going to want to get renter' s insurance.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Listen, Jackie...
I don' t know nothing about tax forms and lease agreements, insurance or whatever.
Hell, man, I never even voted.
In my former line of business, I dealt with cash.
It' s either cash on the barrel, or I' m gonna hit you with the barrel.
You know, balancing a checkbook...
Forget about it.
Luther, you don' t need to be ashamed or embarrassed about anything, OK?
All kinds of people don' t know all kinds of shit.
I can really help you with this stuff.
We could fill those forms out togeth...
What was that for?
For everything.
We' re the new kids on the block, we expect to be picked on, but we don' t run from anybody.
I can' t say the same for some people.
By "some people", do you mean the newly crowned
Middleweight World Champion Pedro Hernandez?
Hernandez claims he' s hungry for a worthy opponent.
Everybody knows Luther' s that guy.
I mean, what, to him, Luther' s the invisible man?
Oh, but I guess it' s hard to see someone when you' re running away from him, especially if you' re running scared.
Now, Pedro Hernandez won the middleweight crown in devastating fashion against a great ex- champ.
Luther, with only 14 fights, do you think you can beat him?
I can, I could, and I most definitely would.
I' d probably knock him out if he didn' t faint first, Pedro.
Well, there' s only one way to see how this cliffhanger will end.
Stay tuned to Channel 28.
Don' t miss what you can see here with me.
Exclusively.
You' re our local guy.
As for Pedro Hernandez, if you' re watching,
Another year, a brand new diary.
Once again I was summoned, kicking and screaming, to my mother' s turkey curry buffet, where I' ve had some of the most shaming experiences of my life.
Hello, darling.
Lovely to see you.
It was, as usual, crammed full with some of the most dangerous perverts In the UK, disguised as close, personal friends of my parents.
- Hello, Bridget.
- Hello, Una.
- Oh, no, thanks.
- Love the jumper.
- I prefer what' s underneath it.
- Uncle Geoffrey!
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Hello.
- Hello, Dad.
How' s it going?
I wish I was dead.
But this year, there was one crucial difference.
- Nice jumper.
- My mother' s taste never falters.
Never.
You always wonder how it' s going to work out at the end of the story.
Marla and Captain Von Trapp,
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,
Mark Darcy and Bridget Jones.
I' ve found my happy ending at last.
And nothing in the world can spoil it.
Well, almost nothing.
Bridget Jones, what the fuck are you doling?
- I, I can' t see anywhere soft to land.
- How about on your arse?
Bridget, unless you want to get sacked at 6, 000 feet, you will be on your way in exactly three seconds.
Three, two, one... cue Bridget.
A dangerous bane to the countryside and emergency services, or a safe and exhilarating hobby?
Well... let' s see, shall we?
Jump.
For Christ’ s sakes, go!
- She' s out.
- We see her.
Bridget, open the chute.
Open it.
Open your fucking parachute!
Pull the thingy or you will die!
Honestly, you forget just one teeny, weeny detail and everyone treats you like an idiot.
# Nobody does it better
Where was I?
Oh, yes...
Mark Darcy.
What happens after you walk off into the sunset?
Bridget?
Earth to Bridget Sodding Jones.
You' re live.
Well, this is Bridget Jones for Sit Up Britain, reporting to you from a big vat of excrement.
Give me a close- up of the porker.
Who cares about the odd professional hiccup?
I' ve been in a functional relationship with an adult male for six wonderful weeks, four fabulous days and seven precious hours.
Or to put it another way, 71 ecstatic shags.
He' s given up being snooty, and I' ve given up smoking.
- Well, he thinks I have anyway, which is practically the same thing. #... a dream come true...
Mark Darcy is perfect.
Not a fuckwit, alcoholic, workaholic, pervert or megalomaniac, but total sex god and human rights lawyer.
He is a miracle, really.
Bridget, will you stop?
Go and find something to do.
Sorry.
So, as you can see, the incredible truth is the wilderness years are over.
Bridget Jones is a love pariah no more.
Morning, Bridget.
Late again.
Yes.
Sorry.
I was in bed with my boyfriend.
He' s a human rights lawyer, you know.
Yes, we know.
I cannot believe how fantastic shagging was last night.
Maybe I' il ring him.
No, no...
Obviously it' s important to tell one' s boyfriend how nice he looks naked, but I have crucial, Pulitzer Prize winning journalism to do.
Hello?
It' s me.
Just wondered how you are.
I' m fine, thanks.
Everything all right with you?
Fine, though, er...
And you do have a genuinely gorgeous bottom.
Thank you.
I' m with the Mexican ambassador, the head of Amnesty International and the Undersecretary for Trade and Industry.
And you' re on speakerphone.
Right, well...
I' m quite busy with important stuff too...
Bridget, we' re waiting for that tape about Tom, the happy hamster.
- I' il call when I' ve finished.
- Excellent.
And Richard wants to see you about that crap skydiving report.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, dear.
Is this the end of my career?
No, It can' t be.
I am a journalist of the highest standards and integrity.
This is Bridget Jones reporting from a big vat of excrement.
Look, I never said I could skydive and I' m terrified of heights,
- so it was really hard to concentrate.
- Be quiet.
They loved it upstairs.
And they want us to come up with another regular spot for you.
That' s...
- I won' t let you down, Richard.
- Precisely.... my friends' motto was "When in Rome, do as many Romans as you can."
But if your tastes are marginally more highbrow, I also have tips.
Forget the Forum, definitely forget the Coliseum, no fun now they can' t slaughter Christians.
Forget the Sistine Chapel, first example of a poof interior designer gone mad...
What is Daniel Oleaver doing on the television?
It' s called The Smooth Guide.
"Making culture bearable".... equally serene and equally beautiful Professore Giovana Dabrache.
Who is about to show me her diptych.
Same old creep.
Shame.
He always speaks very warmly of you.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
How about we go out for a bite to eat tonight?
Can’ t.
I have to go out with my boyfriend.
- He' s a human rights lawyer.
I' m meeting him for a romantic supper.
- Bridget Jones.
- Bridget, It' s Mark.
I was just talking about you.
I' m running late.
Do you want me to cancel?
- Oh.
No, that' s fine.
- Are you sure?
Be as late as you like.
Chuck him, while you' re not pregnant with his unwanted child.
I only said he was working late.
In one hour, he' il be coming in his secretary' s mouth while he rings to say what he wants for starters.
Friends spend years finding you a boyfriend, then instantly tell you to dump him.
Even if he isn' t shagging her already, he' s thinking about it.
A man dating a woman with large breasts will bed one with small breasts.
Rubbish.
Mark' s above all that nonsense.
Jellyfisher alert.
Jellyfisher alert.
Janey Osborne.
Talking to her is like swimming in a sea and being stung repeatedly by an enormous jellyfish.
Bridget.
How' s it going with that divine man of yours?
You must be so pleased to have a boyfriend at last.
First jellyfish of the evening.
Is he taking you to the Law Council Dinner?
Well, I' m sure he' s just forgotten.
Better start slimming into that dress.
He' s given you the night off to cheer up your single friends.
Sweet.
Actually, he' s got a big case on, trying to get everyone in Mexico out of prison.
We' re meeting for a very late romantic dinner.
Really?
'cause I saw him an hour ago going into his house with Rebecca Gillies.
She' s only 22.
And Daddy owns half of Australia.
See ya, babes.
What' s she doing going into my boyfriend' s house?
Where he never asks me.
And with legs up to here?
- My legs only come up to there.
- You have fine legs.
Climber’ s legs.
I say go over there and ask him, straight out, are you or are you not sleeping with Rebecca Gillies?
- If he says...
- I won' t dignify that with an answer...
Then you know he' s shagging her.
It' s all about confidence and trust.
Mark would never betray me.
Everything will be lovely and we' il have sex in the kitchen.
- Oh, God.
- I' m coming.
What is that?
Two seconds, I' il be straight down.
Who is that? #...
Let' s get on with it. #... oh, you better stop
Bridget Jones.
No, I' m Bridget Jones.
- That' s what I meant.
- You must be...
Rebecca Gillies.
I' ve been so looking forward to meeting you
- Why?
What' s he said?
- Where is Mark?
- Actually, er...
- Becky, who is it?
- Becky?
- Right.
- Great.
- Right...
- Bridget.
Hello, Mark.
lawyers who work with Mark.
Good evening.
Everything under control, I see.
Excellent graph.
- Lovely legs.
- Thank you.
I am so sorry.
I thought...
Oh, I don' t know what I thought.
Now you' re really angry with me.
- No, I' m not.
- It' s OK, you can say if you are.
- It' s not the end of the world.
- I' il get you a glass of wine.
The thing is I ran into Janey Osborne, who said she' d just seen you with this girl, with really long legs, and Shazzer and Jude said I should get over here straightaway.
Following the orders of the dating war command, you executed a raid.
- You are angry.
- I' m not, just disappointed.
Disappointed?
Oh, God, that' s worse than angry.
I' m just disappointed I can' t take you home this instant.
What about all those lawyers?
Oh, plenty of time to butter them up at the Law Council Dinner next Friday.
Don' t want to go, do you?
I' d love to.
Oh, stupid Bridget, stupid friends.
Wonderful, loyal Mark Darcy...... who loves me just the way I am.
- What are you doing?
- Getting dressed.
Why are you dancing around in that tent?
Because I don' t want you to see any of my wobbly bits.
That' s pointless, because I have a very high regard for your wobbly bits in all circumstances.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
I think it' s high time we had another look.
He really is very, very, very nice.
# That you loved me
I miss you too.
I' ve never been happier In my entire life.
However, must not obsess or fantasise.
Bridget Darcy.
Mrs Darcy.
Mr and Mrs Darcy.
Lord and Lady Darcy.
Wonder what Mark Darcy would be like as a father.
To his children, I mean, not to me.
That would be a weird, Oedipus- like thought.
At last, life is on track.
Fiancée, wife... mother.
Bugger.
Ever fancied doing it in the dark with a total stranger?
All right, perhaps not a total stranger.
Back off, Oleaver, or I' il report you to a sexual harassment tribunal.
I' m a serious journalist.
Is that your most serious skirt, Jones?
Oh...
Do you like it?
I thought you hated television.
I hate watching television.
Being on it is...
Hello there.... entirely different.
Daniel, thought the Madrid piece was outstanding, really original.
Cheers, Jeremy.
Appreciate that.
We had to work really hard on that one.
Tosser.
Talking of which, how is Mark Darcy?
- You still...?
- Yes, I am.
And I intend to be for a very long time.
You know what a fan I am of any woman married to Mark Darcy.
- That' s not funny.
- Seriously, though, Jones, speaking purely unselfishly, I worry about you.
You do know that it' s a fact that most lawyer' s wives die of boredom?
And what about you?
Still shagging anything that moves?
As a matter of fact, no.
No shagging whatsoever.
I' m in shag therapy.
I go to meetings, talk about my feelings.
Hug people who smell.
- I don' t believe you.
I won' t make a pig' s ear of it.
Daniel.
Meeting?
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks.
Very good hair, Jones.
By the way, um, you' re not free for dinner tonight, are you?
No, I' m not.
I' m going to the Law Council Dinner.
It' s a very important evening.
I can' t wear that.
Bridge, do you want to get married and have babies before you become barren?
Trust me...
My only grown- up friend.
Married to Mark' s partner.
She actually got engaged on the night of the Law Council Dinner.
Try it with the dress.
Oh, my God!
Remember, we are trying to reduce your body size by 15 per cent.
You hold the front, I' il hold the back.
One, two, three...
What' s going on in there?
Not too bad, actually.
Tra- la!
Fantastic.
Right, let us begin.
I am going to make you into a princess.
Goody.
Nothing like being In the hands of a total genius.
Wow.
- Whatever you do...
- Bugger it.... don' t iron your hair.
It' s a lot worse than I thought.
We could flatten it with Brylcreem.
What about a wig?
Lawyers love wigs.
- I preferred you in the gold.
- No, whatever you do, not the gold.
I' m late with mad hair and can barely breathe in scary knickers.
I' m very worried.
What if someone says "Bridget Jones, get out of here, you are ridiculous"?
Stop it.
The most important thing, of course, Is to look absolutely wonderful and make a magnificent entrance.
Hi.
Sorry I' m late.
- Hello.
- I think you should go to the ladies.
But I went before I left home.
Trust me on this one.
Oh.
Not good.
All right, tiny make- up mistake, but I always have wit and conversation to fall back on.
Thank you.
- Bridget.
- Hello.
Derek, Horatio, Camilla.
- Horatio?
- Yes, Horatio.
Horatio was just saying he' s totally against charitable giving.
- What?
- Well, obviously you don' t mean it.
Do you think it' s helpful to give a beggar fifty pence?
- Maybe he' s just hungry.
- Don' t be so naive.
The people you see outside the tube every day are there by choice.
- End of story.
- Oh, no, it' s not.
Some people have terrible personal problems, and other people might have lost their family in some tragic ferry disaster.
And some people are just plain hopeless.
Tory, Home Counties, upper- middle- class twits.
How did I do?
You seem to have made quite an impression.
I' ve put you next to Giles Benwick.
- Oh, I' m not sitting next to you?
- No.
He' s terribly nice, but his wife' s just run off with one of the partners.
He probably won' t mention it, but you should know.
I always knew she was out of my league.
You see, there' s the high- fliers, like Annabel and Mark Darcy and there' s the gorgeous girls, like Rebecca there and there' s the rest of us.
Like you and me, you mean?
Absolutely.
I mean, look at the state of us.
You and me stumbled into the VlP room by mistake and it' s only a matter of moments before they show us the door.
My lords, ladies and gentlemen, let the quiz begin.
Oh, goody.
I love quizzes.
All those years of playing Trivial Pursuits are about to pay off.
Ready?
Here we go.
What are something called "customary freeholds"?
Superior copyhold.
Yes.
What is the correct grace used in the Inner Temple for the second mooting night of Michaelmas term?
Amas bibendo... fructis.
Jolly good.
What is an overreaching conveyance?
What is rack- rent?
When was breach of promise abolished?
Define "damnum sentit dominus".
Translate "reddendo singula singulis" into Ancient Greek.
I believe this is the answer.
Hippodamoi credemnon louestai.
Absolutely correct.
Now, for our final and deciding round, the category is contemporary culture.
Who did the design for Princess Diana' s wedding dress?
The Emmanuels.
- Correct.
- Excellent, Bridget.
Name the character in Footballers' Wives who, in one memorable episode, set fire to her own breasts.
Chardonnay.
Correct.
At this point, there are only two tables in contention and only one question left.
What was the name of Madonna' s first UK single?
Lucky Star.
- Sorry, I didn' t quite hear.
- Are you sure?
- Wasn' t it Holliday?
- No, everyone thinks it is, but it' s not.
My entire life has been leading up to this very moment.
Take that knife, slice off my head and boil it if I' m wrong.
The correct answer is Lucky Star.
No.
- The correct answer is...
- Is it Holliday?
Holliday, indeed, yes.
The winners of the 42nd Annual Law Council Quiz are... the Legal Eagles.
- Oh, thanks, Rebecca.
Good night.
Why didn' t you speak to me all night?
That' s the point of those dinners.
And you talked to Horatio.
I' il never fit in with your friends.
Not if you go on calling everyone "balding, upper- middle- class twits".
Well, they were balding, upper- middle- class twits.
Except for the ones who had hair.
I suppose you agree with them that poor people deserve to be poor?
Don' t be ridiculous.
- So now I' m ridiculous?
- Yes, tonight you were a little.
Well, tonight you were an arrogant arse.
I think I may have made a mistake inviting you and your folding underpants into my life.
Good night.
I' d have said no, anyway.
Asked you what?
Bridget?
Asked you what?
Oh, God, I' ve done it.
I' ve gone and done it.
One minute, you' re closer to someone than anyone in the whole world, next minute, you' re never going to see them again.
If you have a message for Mark Darcy, please speak after the tone.
Hello, it' s me.
I' m really, really sorry...
Sorry, it' s the door.
Don' t go away, I have something really, really important to say.
- Yes, who is it?
- It' s me.
- Oh, right.
Er, just a moment.
I' m on the phone.
You' re outside.
Look, er...
I' il ring you later.
Unless you' ve come to chuck me once and for all.
In which case, bye and thank you, and... sorry.
Oh, God, please don' t chuck me.
If you have chucked me, please change your mind,
I' il behave much better in future.
Stuck- up snob.
What do you want?
I' d like to come up.
You are, after all, my girlfriend.
Even though I shouted at you and called you an arrogant arse?
Unfortunately, yes.
You see, the problematic thing is...
I love you.
W- what?
- I said I love you.
- I' m sorry, I missed that again.
I said I love you, for God' s sake!
All right, no need to shout.
I' il come down and let you in.
You might be needing this in the future.
He said he loves me.
- He said he loves you?
- He said he loves me.
- Right, where is he now?
- He' s in the bedroom.
Go back in there, Bridge, and whatever you do, act completely nonchalant.
Bridget, you' re staring at me again.
Sorry.
Listen, I know this evening didn' t go exactly as planned, but there was a very important question I wanted to ask you tonight.
- Oh, really?
- Yes.
I' ve actually been meaning to ask this for quite some time.
I' ve just never really found the right way to put it.
Darling Bridget...... would you...... like to go on a skiing mini- break?
Yes!
This is not just a mini- break.
This is a holiday in heaven.
Told a tiny lie about being an extremely experienced skier.
But, honestly, how hard can it be?
- Shall we?
[Bridget [I know I' m going to like skiing a lot.
Very romantic, very relaxing.
- Bar going up.
Why?
Oh, God.
Oh.
Bridget.
Rebecca.
What are you doing here?
- Didn' t Mark tell you we were coming?
- No, he didn' t.
It was me who recommended the place.
- I' ve been coming since I was 11.
- Really?
Three whole years.
Come on, up you get.
Come on.
- There you go.
- Are you all right?
Yes, fine, thanks.
- You sure?
- Why is Rebecca here?
Oh, God.
Well, I mentioned that we were coming and she said why didn' t they come too, and I couldn' t say no, could I?
Come on, you two, let' s crack on, shall we?
Actually, I might just sit this one out.
You head on.
- See you down there.
- You sure?
Absolutely.
I' il be fine in a minute.
Right, I' il see you at base camp, then.
Bastard.
I can' t believe he' s left me.
Ooh.
Oooh.
So, romantic getaway has turned into lawyer' s reunion.
Oooh.
I can' t believe we' re already into group holidays after only eight weeks of total, undisturbed sex.
Walt a minute...
No.
Eight weeks?
It couldn' t be, could it?
Totally undisturbed...
Oh, God.
I' m pregnant.
And going to die!
Oh, my God!
I can' t see!
Big bump!
Get out of the way!
Who' s this?
An eccentric but exhilarating performance from a total unknown, who' s now solidly in position for the bronze.
I would like a pregnancy test, please.
A pregnancy test.
Ich bien, er, possibly... mit baby.
Er...
Kinder!
Er, with me.
She' s pregnant!
Oh, no!
No, no, not pregnant.
She' s bloated.
- Condom?
- Nein.
Nein, nein.
Maybe like this, but maybe like this.
I think her problem is psychological.
There is nothing a pill can do to help her.
I' m a girl and I met a boy.
Fraulein, and I met frau... boy.
And possibly now mit baby, uh- huh?
Right, moment of truth awaits.
What if I am pregnant?
I must try not to get hopes up too high.
Boyfriend and baby seems just too lucky.
Bridget?
I have been looking everywhere for you.
I thought you' d broken a leg or something...
Oh, God.
- You' re not...?
- I might be.
- What if I were?
- Well, I suppose I' d...
To be quite frank, it' d be bloody fantastic.
I mean, if a little ahead of schedule.
- Are you really pregnant?
- Well, give it three minutes.
- What do you fancy?
Boy or a girl?
- I dunno, it doesn' t matter.
Although, I suppose I' ve always had the fantasy of a son.
- Another Mark Darcy.
- Or maybe something like Huck.
Or River.
Or some fabulous Hebrew name like Noah.
Anyway, I could teach him to play cricket and rugby and visit him at Eton on St Andrew' s Day.
Eton?
Yes.
The Darcy men have been going to Eton for five generations.
Well, my son' s not going to be sent away from home.
Especially to some fascist institution where they stick a poker up your arse that you' re never allowed to remove again.
I see.
- I didn' t mean you.
- No, of course not.
So what' s the alternative?
Sleeping in his parents' bed, breastfeeding until he' s a teenager and some progressive school, where the day is spent singing Yellow Submarine?
Oh, you' re absolutely right.
It' s madness to allow a child to enjoy his education or live with his parents.
What is madness is to have a child if his parents can' t have a discussion without one shouting at the other.
It' s negative.
- That' s too bad.
- Yes, very sad.
Perhaps we should go out for lunch tomorrow.
Get out of the grump.
That' s a good idea in theory, but you made a family arrangement.
Oh, God.
Darlings!
I' ve had the fabulous idea of inviting your parents.
Another one of Mother' s culinary triumphs.
- Everything in miniature.
- Mini treacle tart, Admiral Darcy?
No, no, thank you.
The mini spotted dick rather finished me off.
So, Mark, Bridget, when are you two lovebirds going to name the day?
Bridget, you must want to hear those ding- dong bells.
Well, we' re certainly not thinking about that yet.
Are we, Bridget?
No.
God, no.
Of course not.
Good.
Well, that' s that sorted.
How was it?
- Did you mean that thing you said?
- What thing?
- You know what thing.
- No, I don' t know what thing.
The thing thing.
Now, let' s see, there are any number of things, um... in an afternoon full of all sorts of things, so I, um...
The thing where you said you' re not, um...
That you' re not, not even thinking about, um...
What' s the matter?
I' m going to go to the loo, then I' m going to come back.
And then we' re going to be civilised.
If you have a message for Mark Darcy, speak after the tone.
Mark, It' s Rebecca.
Are you there?
Obviously not.
Probably still out with Bridget.
Anyway, I hope lunch with the parents went well.
I' m sure you were dutiful and very polite, as usual.
Whatever.
Anyway, look, maybe give me a ring when you get back.
Bridget' s probably there.
Sleep tight.
Oh, Christ, what now?
Are you or are you not having an affair with Rebecca Gillies?
I won' t dignify that question with an answer.
Right.
All I did was go to the loo.
Bridget!
Bridget.
That' s not your coat.
Oh, right.
Oh, Bridget, what are you doing?
I read you should never date someone if you can think of three reasons not to.
- Can you think of three?
- Yes.
- Which are?
- Well, first off, I embarrass you.
I can' t ski, I can' t ride, I can' t speak Latin.
My legs only come up to here and yes, I will always be a little bit fat.
And you, you fold your underpants before you go to bed.
- Now, hang on, that can' t be a reason.
- No, it' s not a reason.
But you' re not perfect either.
You look down your nose at absolutely everyone, and you' re incapable of doing anything spontaneous or potentially affectionate.
It feels like you' re waiting to find someone in the VlP room who' s, who' s so fantastic... just the way she is, that you don' t need to fix her.
Bridget, this is mad.
Perhaps you' ve already found her.
Do you want to marry me?
Look, I...
You see, you can never muster the strength... to fight for me.
I can' t believe I did that.
Five weeks later.
Weight:
4, 000 pounds.
Am enjoying a relationship with two men simultaneously.
The first is called Ben, the other, Jerry.
Zero.
Number of calls from ex- boyfriend:
You have absolutely no messages.
Not a single one.
Not even from your mother.
- Hello?
- Hello, darling.
- You haven' t forgotten our lunch date?
- Of course I have.
- I' m suicidally depressed.
- Don' t be silly, Bridget.
Meet me at Debenhams at twelve o' clock.
Mum...
I thought we were going to have something to eat.
Patience, please.
I' ve got a big surprise for you, darling.
- What?
- Don' t say "what", say "pardon".
Tra- la!
- What do you think?
- Oh, my God.
Daddy and I are getting married.
- You' re already married.
- We' re doing it again.
Reaffirming our vows.
You are going to be a bridesmaid, and absolutely everything is going to be lavender.
And when I say everything, I mean...... everything.
Oh, God, I' m never going to get married and my sodding mum and dad are doing it twice.
The Big, Juicy Apple.
The city that never sleeps with the same person two nights running.
It' s a promise.
Morning, Rach.
Sorry.
Oh, cheer up, misery guts.
I have good news for you.
Sure, right.
What' s the angle?
I interview some rocket scientist while he looks through my skirt with X- ray glasses?
No.
Although that is a bloody good idea.
The fact is The Smooth Guide is doing very well with women, but the network want us to cast a wider net and use a Smooth Guide- ess.
Me?
With Daniel Oleaver?
It' s the next logical step.
I think Thailand is first on the list.
I won' t do it.
Not in a million years from now.
- Excuse me?
- I am a top television journalist, not some boorish bint in a bikini.
Really?
Strong words from somebody who doesn' t know where Germany is.
Who told you that?
Oleaver.
He said he couldn' t be expected to go out with someone who thought Iran was David Bowie' s wife, and who didn' t know where Germany was.
Daniel Oleaver is a deceitful, sexist, disgusting specimen of humanity, that I wouldn' t share a lift with, let alone a job.
Come on, Jones, there must have been something you liked about me.
Well... you have a nice car.
And quite nice manners.
Outside the bedroom.
But that' s about it.
And by the way, I know exactly where Germany is.
The question is do you know the location of your arsehole?
As a matter of fact, I do know the exact location of my arsehole.
And hers.
Oh, come on, Jones, it was just a silly joke.
Not a very funny one.
- What?
Where is it?
Where is Germany?
- And?
And also Belgium...
And it has a sea coast.
Which sea?
Now, look,
I think we should talk about Finch' s suggestion.
I am going to Thailand, Jones.
Wouldn' t you like to be my little Girl Guide?
Thailand?
- You' il shag before you leave Heathrow.
- I' il be perfectly fine.
I' m eschewing all men.
And carbohydrates.
- We can' t possibly let you go.
- On your own.
Oh, stop it, all of you.
I am a mature, sophisticated, professional woman and I' m going to Thailand entirely on my own, thank you very much.
- Fuck!
- Sorry.
- Fuckity fuck.
- Sorry.
And now our final passengers have joined us, we can get underway.
Someone' s gotta be last.
Are we not sitting together?
Oh, fuck.
Hi.
Sorry.
What' s your name?
Mine' s Olive.
Er, Bridget.
Good afternoon again, ladles and gentlemen.
We' re about to offer a wide range of duty- free items.
Details can be found In your in- flight magazine.
Wonderful people, the Thais.
Particularly the young ladies.
If you know what I mean, eh?
- Oh, for heaven' s sake.
- Come with me.
Come with me now.
- Where are we going?
- Just through here.
Thank you.
This is worse than school.
It really wasn' t my fault.
It just sort of fizzied over.
Couldn’ t bear to think of you back there in slum class, Jones.
Graham, thank you.
You are the best air steward I' ve ever come across.
And if I may say so, the smartest.
Thank you, sir.
I thought you were there already, doing research.
I make it up as I go along.
It' s 13 hours for this trip.
I need some in- flight entertainment.
Why don' t you tell me, in detail, about your school netball tour, particularly the unsavoury incident in the communal showers.
Or go to a girls' school.
- Or have showers.
- Now that' s just not true, is it?
- Let me start you off.
- No.
If you' re gonna be dull, I' m going to plunge back into Mrs Dalloway, and you know how she loves that.
Dirty, dirty bitch.
Arrived Bangkok.
Very hot.
Relieved at last to throw myself Into serious journalistic work.
Thailand has long called travellers from around the globe to take spiritual succour and karmic rest.
For centuries, Western visitors have been inevitably drawn to some of Bangkok' s oldest sanctuaries.
So true, Bridget.
Even I, fight it as I may, am no exception.
The moment I arrive here, I almost feel an irresistible pull...... to this.
The Temple of Tranquillity.
Indeed, nothing symbolises Thailand' s extraordinary fusion of East and West, of tradition and innovation, better than this.
Fully body- to- body massage.
- Sawatdee khrab?
An incredible thing about Thailand is the amazing traditional cuisine.
I' m going to taste kapaluk, the ultimate delicacy.
Oh, fuck!
My God.
Er...
Mmm.
How about a lovely locust?
I can' t.
No, no, I can' t.
They' re delicious.
Oh!
Now that is Ko Panyi, which is the setting for a very famous Thai poem, which I think you' d like very much, Jones.
It' s all about a badly- behaved prince who finds true love with a beautiful, and as it happens, very slightly overweight princess.
- You' re teasing me.
- I never tease about poetry.
"Oh, Suvarnamali Why can you not see that I adore you?"
"Why do you avoid and scorn me?"
"If you cast me off and leave me
How should I live another day? "
And you thought all I knew of Thailand was pussies and ping- pong balls.
- You wouldn' t sleep with him?
- No, of course not.
Absolutely not.
But he is clever.
- Yes?
- And handsome.
He' s also a dysfunctional, fucked- up, middle- aged, lost boy.
Well, no- one' s perfect.
I didn' t realise you were busy.
- He' s young enough to be your grandson.
Isn' t that great?
Come on, guys, I' ve got a very special treat lined up for lunch.
I' m getting rather fond of Jed, and I must say he has a genuine interest In Thai cuisine.
I wouldn' t have thought omelette would be big in Thailand.
- Or mushrooms, for that matter.
- It' s magic.
It is a magic mushroom omelette, isn' t it?
Well, that' s awful.
There is nothing funny in this at all.
Although, thank God, the mushrooms don' t actually seem to be working.
Such lovely colours!
# We wanna get loaded And we wanna have a good time...
Beautiful Bridget!
Beautiful Bridget!
Bridget Jones!
Bridget Jones!
But, wait...
- Bridget Jones?
- What sound is that?
It is Daniel Oleaver.
How unutterably beautiful he is.
Jones, what the hell are you doing?
You are lovely colours. - # I don' t wanna lose your love...
I think you' re completely off your face.
Hey.
Oh, I' m an angel.
How lovely.
Glorious sand.
Oh.
I want to be naked.
- Naked as a baby.
- Come on, then, angel.
Up you get.
- Mmm.
- How are you feeling?
- Completely embarrassed.
You' re charming on drugs.
In future, just say yes.
Do you know, I never really understood why you wanted to go out with me.
- It seemed so unlikely.
For God' s sake.
You make me laugh.
At you, of course, not with you.
And you were...... incidentally...... the best shag...... I ever had.
The best?
Aside from Simon Reade in the fifth- form locker room, yeah.
Suppose I said you were pretty good too?
Pretty good?
Was I better than Mark Darcy?
By the way, is it true he always says "I' m sorry, I think I' m going to come"?
- Who told you that?
- It' s common knowledge, isn' t it?
Come on, Jones.
Who gave who the hoof?
And why?
Let' s just say that we suffered from a fatal incompatibility.
I have missed you, Jones.
I don' t suppose there' s any circumstances in which you would ever consider thinking about trusting me again?
Absolutely not.
Well, I suppose I' il be getting back to my little hut now.
Thank you very much, Daniel.
I had a nice time.
Is that the Big Dipper or the little one?
I can never tell them apart.
Definitely the big one.
You can' t see the little one this close to the equator.
Oh, please.
You don' t know about astronomy.
I most certainly do.
I' m passionate about it.
You know, Jones, if stargazing is something that interests you, then it has to be said that the view from my balcony is quite outstanding.
Perhaps you' d like to come up and have a little look?
I don' t think so.
See over there?
Along my arm.
That' s it, over there.
That is Orion' s Belt.
And next to that is a very sexy little constellation called Ursa' s Maiden.
Ah.
She' s being very naughty and trying to undo Orion' s belt.
All right, what about... that one?
Yes, well that is a very, very famous star.
Um, right next to, of course, um...
I don' t know, some other fucking star that' s been there for years and years.
Seen one star, you' ve seen the lot, that' s what I say, Jones.
Different with girls, though.
Some girls...... are special.
Are they?
I think so.
What is this special power you hold over me, Jones?
And what about your therapy?
I think you might be it.
God, I hope you' re wearing those giant panties.
Please.
Please be wearing the giant panties.
Please.
Oh, my old friends.
Oh, Daddy' s home.
Did you miss me?
Yes, he did.
Wait.
Sorry.
Can I just have a minute?
Just a minute.
Oh, God.
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, sure.
Just a bit... nervous.
I mean, you see, if I stay with you tonight, well, it' s definitely the end of something... important with someone.
- Bridge, Bridge Bridge, Bridge.
Doesn' t everyone deserve a second chance?
Hmm?
Except Hitler.
Well, he was very, very, very naughty.
Nothing.
Er, come back later, please.
Thank you very much.
Leave it.
Leave it.
You made order for 10. 30.
Order for what?
Me.
10. 30.
You know, I' ve had it up to here with this hotel.
- It' s been cock- ups like this all week.
- You Mr Oleaver?
Yesterday, you with Maria.
She say you big tipper.
I mean, I' m up for it if you are.
Actually, no, that was stupid.
It' s just one little slip.
Don' t let it ruin what was gonna be a fantastic weekend shagathon.
- I don' t want a shagathon.
- No, nor do I. Nor do I.
- You' re right.
- You' re looking for a weekend of sex,
- I' m looking...
- For more.
I feel I can change.
- I absolutely can change.
- I need to change.
I can' t believe I fell for it again.
Daniel, I really do think that you should go and fuck yourself.
Or her.
But definitely not me. - # Think - # Think
I can' t believe he made up the sex therapy thing.
Doesn' t matter.
I finally learnt my lesson, and it' s an excellent lesson to have nailed.
- What?
No fucking room in the fucking suitcase.
There' s room in mine.
Give me something.
Great.
- What the hell is this?
- It is a fertility- snake bowl.
- Ooh.
- Jed gave it to me. - # Think think - # Let your mind go...
How romantic.
The way I look at it, in everyone' s life, there' s a certain amount of shit.
- That' s true.
- In the last year, things have turned out pretty shitty.
So logically, mathematically, even, it' s got to be time for something not shit.
- Like what?
- Maybe Mark will have chucked Rebecca.
And he' il run to my door, fall to his knees, possibly wearing a wet white shirt, and beg me to come back. - # Think - # Think
Yes, I very confidently expect very, very good times ahead.
Final call for all passengers to London...
Isn' t he cute?
Hello.
Hello.
Oh...
Seems to be getting a bit excited.
Oh.
Er...
- Bridget!
- It' s just a misunderstanding.
Hold the plane.
Hold the plane.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
All remaining passengers please report to Gate 27 immediately.
It' s not mine.
- These yours?
- Yes.
I mean, they' re not my favourite pair.
You can' t do this.
I' m English.
And an award- winning journalist.
Well, maybe not award- winning, but I have been to lots of award ceremonies.
Hello.
Bridget Jones.
Lovely to meet all of you.
Oh, my bloody God and fuck.
I hope they' ve told the British ambassador.
Surely Shazzer would have raised the alert.
Maybe they got Shazzer as well.
Oh, God, 28 hours.
Jones.
Bridget Jones, you come now.
Charlie Parker- Knowles, Assistant Consul.
Thank God you' re here.
Um, shall we...
I really had absolutely nothing to do with it.
Jed planned the whole thing.
That' s why he snogged Shazzer, who' s much older than him and slightly past her peak.
Yes, he sounds the most frightful shit.
Mmm.
The bore is everyone who gets caught has exactly the same story, so unless we find this, this Jed fellow and get a full confession, you' re on a bit of a sticky wicket.
Well, how sticky?
Something like 15 to 20 years.
- 15 years?
- Or maybe ten if we' re lucky.
Ten years!
In here?
Very black.
All my life I' ve had the feeling something terrible was about to happen.
Now it has.
Bijjit, right?
Bridget, actually.
My name Phrao.
You' re my friend?
- Superbra!
You lend me.
One day, two cigarette.
Oh.
Well, I' il think about it.
Actually, I was thinking of giving up, but that was before I was arrested and thrown into a Thai prison for ten to 15 years.
Circumstances change.
No, it really, really is "touched".
"Like a vir- gin, touched for the very first time".
- No.
# Like a wersion
- Touched. - # Like a wersion
I
Enough.
Enough.
If you' re going to do it, you really ought to do it properly.
After all, Madonna is nothing if not a perfectionist.
# Touched for the very first time
Dear Mum and Dad,
I' m missing you a lot.
Please write as soon as you can.
I' m feeling pretty low.
Bijjit Jone.
In there.
You have five minutes.
Just five.
Mark?
You all right?
Oh...
Fine.
Hmm.
And... scared shitless.
But, you know, perky.
I can' t believe you' ve come all this way.
I haven' t.
I was out here handling a Foreign Office case when I heard about your situation.
I haven' t done anything wrong.
I promise you, it' s all a big mistake.
Yes, well, I' m sure it is.
I' ve got all the papers here and I' m sure we can sort it out.
I think about you all the time.
I really, really am, for everything that happened between us.
Yes, well...
We don' t have much time and I need you to identify someone for me.
Is this the man with whom you were seen taking hallucinogenic mushrooms before you spent the night with Daniel Oleaver?
Yes, that' s him, but I think you should know...
The same man who gave you the snake containing the drugs?
Yes, that' s him, that' s Jed.
But it was Shazzer' s snake, not mine, and as far as Daniel Oleaver goes...
Your sex life doesn' t concern me at all.
Has there been any ill treatment here?
Well, I mean...... the toilet facilities are well below par, but...
Good, that makes things simpler.
Listen, they' re prepared to drop all charges against you which is extremely lenient, given the circumstances.
You' re going to be out within a week.
And...
Goodbye.
Mark?
Thank you.
You' re welcome.
I' m just the messenger.
The order came from above.
Well, good luck.
Glad I could be of help.
So, Bijjit, what happen?
Well, um...
Bijjit!
How this can happen?
This is terrible!
You are innocent!
- No, no, no.
That' s all fine.
They' ve dropped the charges and they' re letting me go.
But that good news.
What is wrong?
Mark Darcy definitely...... doesn' t love me anymore.
You see the trouble is it was me who chucked him.
He treat you bad?
Yeah, actually, he did.
My boyfriend treat me bad too.
- Mine as well.
Me too.
Then you know all about it.
You think you' ve found the right man, but then there' s so much wrong with him and he finds there' s so much wrong with you and it all just falls apart.
Don' t tell me.
My boyfriend, he seem really nice.
Then he start to hit me.
Make me work on street.
My boyfriend, he say he love me.
But he do no work, and make me work 24 hour a day.
What about you, Bijjit?
What your bad boyfriend do?
Oh, same sort of thing, really.
Stealing all my money and stuff.
Oh, God.
I' ve been the world’ s biggest fool.
Bijjit?
Just a few tiny leaving presents.
No luxuries.
If you want something smooth on your wall, you could do worse than John Currin.
He is about the only contemporary painter who can paint.
There' s usually something interesting and allegorical, plus of course, there is a very high perv quotient.
- Out.
Out it.
Sorry, everyone, sorry.
It' s my stalker.
Fuck off, Darcy, some people have jobs to do.
Did you see her surrounded by police, dogs, handcuffs?
Come on, she' s a big girl, she can take care of herself.
I' m only going to ask you one more time.
Did you see her?
You' re only gonna ask me one more time?
- You haven' t got your wig on now, dear.
- I' il take that as a yes.
Yes, I did see her.
I thought she was smuggling seashells, or mangoes:
Right, good.
Will you step outside, please?
Oh, no, it' s not possible.
Darcy, do you have any idea what century we actually live in?
Are you gonna step outside or am I gonna have to drag you?
I think you' re gonna have to drag me.
- You' re insane!
- And you' re a disgrace, Oleaver.
You' re pulling my hair!
I' m not going in the sodding water.
- Fuck off!
- No, you' re going in, Oleaver!
If I' m going in, you' re coming with me.
You smug bastard.
- Get up.
Well, what are you gonna do now?
Drown me in 16 inches of water?
Yes, good idea.
Fuck!
Stop, stop.
Listen, listen, listen...
OK, I left her at the airport.
I shouldn' t have done that.
But she bumped into Jed herself and I didn' t fucking well seduce her, all right?
- You didn' t?
- There' s something wrong with her.
She' s gone all frigid.
I spent the night with a gorgeous Thai girl.
Who in fact turned out to be a gorgeous Thai boy.
Satisfied?
Yes.
Thank you.
You know what, mate?
If you' re so obsessed with Bridget Jones, why don' t you just marry her?
'Cause then she' d definitely shag me.
- Bridget!
Over here!
- What was it like?
- How did you survive?
Any girl who' s been single in London knows how to handle herself.
- Darling!
- Will you be going back?
Sorry I didn' t write.
I' ve just been so busy.
Hello, darling.
You look lovely.
- Skinny, but lovely.
- Oh, thank you.
Oh, it' s good to be home.
- Ciggy?
- No, no, thanks.
- I' ve given up again.
- Shame.
I find them very useful.
I take great comfort in the fact they might kill me before things get worse.
The Darcys rang to say how pleased they were you were out.
I rather thought Mark might be here to meet you.
Yes, but you must remember we split up.
So no hope there?
No hope there.
Believe me, next time I will not fuck it up, Mum.
- Sorry.
Next time, I will not fuck it up...... Mother.
Surprise!
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Oh, darling.
- Hiya.
Bridget...
I' m so sorry.
It' s all right.
Well, thank God for Mark Darcy.
I mean, he might be a boring arse, but he performed a miracle.
That' s a bit of an overstatement.
He actually seems to be the villain of this piece.
He' s a top human rights lawyer and he left it to someone else to get me out.
He was just a messenger.
- Who told you that?
- He did.
Straight from the horse' s mouth.
The horse wasn' t quite telling you the truth.
I called Mark the minute I landed in London.
We went to his office and within half an hour, he' d woken two Cabinet ministers and half of Ml5.
But none of them could locate Jed, so Mark flew over to Interpol.
Which is in Lyon.
They located Jed in Dubai, but they don' t normally extradite people, so Mark rang the Home Secretary who rang our ambassador...
Saudi Arabia, where Mark was waiting with the police.
Then Mark flew to Bangkok, to make damn sure they' d let you go.
Oh.
He was just angry about Daniel Oleaver.
Taxi?
Yes, please.
Get in the cab!
Hurry!
Oh.
I forgot about you.
Er, I, I, I just wanted to, um... say something to Mark.
He' s at the office.
Do you want to come in?
No, no, I don' t think I will.
I really hope that you' il be happy together.
- Sorry?
- You and Mark.
I really hope that you' il be very happy together.
No, no, no, Bridget, listen... you' ve got it completely wrong.
I' m not in love with him.
How could I be when I' m... seriously heartbroken and smitten with someone else?
Someone else?
- You, Bridget.
- Me?
Ever since I saw you here with your hair messed that night and bits of garden stuck to you.
You must have noticed.
I try to hide it, but every time I see you, I light up.
I thought you were just, you know...... lying.
Was every look I ever gave you a lie?
I' ve been looking forward to this.
Lovely to see you, Bridget.
Thank you very much.
That was lovely.
Really lovely.
But I' m afraid it' s still men in general, and Mark Darcy in particular, that I love.
Right.
Lf, er, if I ever do decide to, um... you know, bat for the other side...... well, there' s no- one else.
Only you.
- Hello, Giles.
- Hello, Bridget.
Inns of Court, please.
Fast as you can.
What do you think of this jacket?
- Yeah, very nice indeed.
- No, be honest.
What do you think of the whole jacket/ trouser combination?
- Disaster.
- Actually, can we take a tiny detour?
I' il be back in literally two seconds.
Oh.
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.
Very important at this moment.
Doesn' t matter.
It' s not about looks.
Excuse me, I' m looking for Mr Darcy.
Down there, right along the corridor, and just to the left.
Thank you very much.
I love you.
I always have and I always will.
Sorry.
Come in.
Hello, Bridget.
Hello, Mark.
I' m sorry, I' m disturbing you.
- Well, yes, a bit.
- I' il just... sit outside while you finish.
No, no, no, please, say what you have to say, young lady.
And Mr Hernández is his number two.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, hello, hello.
How can we help you, young lady?
Well, er...
I just wanted to tell Mr Darcy here that I heard what magnificent work he actually did releasing me from prison.
Tiny, tiny misunderstanding to do with an enormous stash of cocaine.
And I also wanted to say, since having found out that his girlfriend is actually a lesbian...
... that I love him.
Always have.
Always will.
And that I' m...... you know...... available for dates...... if he should feel so inclined.
So, er, your girlfriend is a lesbian.
Look, if you' il all just excuse us for a second...
I think we should...
Bridget, that was not the most romantic proposition I' ve ever heard.
I mean...
I know there' s no music playing, and it' s not snowing, but that doesn' t mean that it, that it can' t really be something.
You' re right.
All right.
As long as it' s not "Will you marry me?"
Oh, God.
It is "Will you marry me?"
Well, I' m not gonna say it now.
- Is it "Will you marry me?"
No.
No, wait.
- Bridget.
- Start again.
- No.
- Start again.
It' s...
We' ve just stepped out into the corridor, you say "I' ve got a question to ask you" and I don' t say anything.
You say...
Bridget Jones, will you marry me?
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here this day to unite this couple.
Do you affirm your love, one to the other?
Again.
And Colin?
Again.
Of course.

Jack, I interest.
First there was darkness.
Then came the strangers.
They were a race as old as time itself.
They had mastered the ultimate technology -- the ability to alter physical reality by will alone.
They called this ability "tuning."
But they were dying.
Their civilization was in decline, and so they abandoned their world seeking a cure for their own mortality.
Their endless journey brought them to a small blue world in the farthest corner of the galaxy... our world.
Here they thought they had finally found what they had been searching for.
My name is Dr Daniel Poe Schreber.
I am just a man.
I help the strangers conduct their experiments.
I have betrayed my own kind.
You are confused, aren' t you?
Frightened.
That' s all right.
I can help you.
Who is this?
I am a doctor.
You must listen to me.
You have lost your memory.
There was an experiment.
Something went wrong.
Your memory was erased.
Do you understand me?
No, I don' t.
What the hell is going on here?
There are people coming for you even as we speak.
You must not let them find you.
Hello?
Are you there?
Hey, Mr Murdoch.
The automat called.
Said you left your wallet there.
I suggest you retrieve it since you only paid for 3 weeks, and they was up
I' ve been here 3 weeks?
It' s right there in black and white, Mr Murdoch.
Day and date.
We make our books like our beds, all neat and tidy.
I' il take care of it when I get back.
See that you do.
Only thing that makes you a guest in this joint, pal, is cash on the barrelhead.
House rules.
Mr Murdoch, yes, where is he?
He just left not 5 minutes ago.
Sleep now.
He said he was your husband' s doctor.
He wanted to speak with you.
Excuse me.
Dr...
Schreber.
Please, won' t you come in?
You must be Emma Murdoch.
Thank you for coming to see me on such short notice.
What is this?
A rather crude experiment designed to further my studies.
I don' t understand.
You say you' re my husband' s doctor, but he never mentioned you to me.
John has been coming to see me for quite some time.
He had been grappling with feelings of betrayal stemming from your marital difficulties.
John told you what happened?
Yes.
When was the last time that you saw him?
3 weeks ago.
He packed a suitcase.
He was very angry at me.
But for John' s sake, I would like you to think of me as your friend, Emma.
It appears John has suffered a psychotic break.
Complete memory loss.
You can' t be serious.
Oh, but I am.
He may be delusional.
Even violent.
lf he were to contact you, you must call me immediately.
Wherever your husband is, he is searching... for himself.
Good evening, Mr Murdoch.
It is Mr Murdoch, isn' t it?
Mr -- was it "J" - something -- Murdoch?
J. Murdoch.
What' s your name?
Justin?
My name' s Jason Murdoch.
John Murdoch.
Jake Murdoch.
How' s it going?
Hi.
Jack Murdoch.
Gotta get a grip on myself.
I told the guy cash on the barrelhead.
I said, "Listen,
Upstairs, sir, room 614.
Another call girl.
Evening, Husselbeck.
lnspector Bumstead.
Your lace is untied.
Sir.
Am I glad you' re here, sir.
They say Detective Walenski' s got the heebie- jeebies.
Just take what they give me, Husselbeck.
Thanks a lot.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Oh, it' s you.
You left your wallet here, buddy.
Oh, when did I do that?
When you was last here.
When was that?
When you left your wallet.
You expect me to remember?
Excuse me.
No, no, seriously.
- Where you headed, chief?
- Home.
And where' s home?
Haven' t you mugs got anything better to do?
Well, I' m just trying to do my job, May.
There' s a killer out there, in case you hadn' t noticed.
Maybe you should be out looking for him instead of cooling your heels, huh?
Aw, go on, get out of here.
Come on.
What' s that make so far, Husselbeck?
6 hookers in all?
I believe so, sir.
Give the man an "A" for effort.
So, Husselbeck, what kind of killer do you think stops to save a dying fish?
You' ve got me, sir.
Bumstead, what took you?
This killer' s been running circles around us, thanks to Walenski.
He' s a good cop.
Whatever kind of cop Walenski once was, he let drift a long time ago.
Let me talk to Bumstead!
Come on, hold it!
Frank, Frank!
Get his arm!
On your feet.
There' s no way out!
God, can you see?!
Let me go, let me go!
I' m not gonna hurt you.
What was that?
Walenski.
I' m being punished for my sins, right?
Where do you begin?
Everything Detective Walenski committed to paper should be here.
The only thing that should be committed is Walenski.
Nothing like a little healthy paranoia.
I came here to file a missing persons report for my husband.
Take it to the front desk.
They told me to come see you.
His name' s John Murdoch.
Do these names mean anything to you?
Who are these women?
Why are you looking for my husband?
Are you going to accuse him of something?
Maybe murder.
Whose murder?
Which one?
All of them.
Mrs Murdoch,
I' m sorry.
I didn' t mean to alarm you.
I' m sorry that I came.
Just both made a mistake.
Please, if you' il just give me half a second.
Have we met before?
I hope you' re still breathing.
What' s your name, honey?
Well, that' s an appropriate name.
I was just thinking.
What you do... seems kind of dangerous... right now.
How do you know I' m not the killer?
You don' t seem like the killer type.
You feeling any urges I should know about?
Aw, shoot.
So it seems you' ve discovered your unpleasant nature.
Who are you?
We might ask the same question, yes?
Sleep now.
He can tune.
What is to be done?
This man is dangerous.
It is said he is able to tune.
lmpossible.
We have seen it with our own eyes.
They behave erratically when they awaken.
We find them wandering like lost children.
But this one was different, yes?
What has the doctor to say about this?
He has failed to report in.
And Mr Quick?
No more Mr Quick.
Mr Quick, dead, yes.
Poor, poor Mr Quick.
Mr Book -- does he know?
Should we not know, Mr Hand?
We had hoped to learn more before sharing with you.
We can know nothing until we possess him.
We must have this man.
My brand, I hope.
I' ve been so worried about you.
Are you punishing me?
I don' t appreciate it.
I don' t know what you' re talking about.
I found these keys in my pocket, so I assume I live here.
You supposed to be my wife?
Supposed to be?
You really... don' t know who I am, do you?
Your doctor called me.
My doctor?
Yeah.
He, uh... he gave me his card.
He' s desperate to find you.
I feel like I' m living out someone else' s nightmare.
What happened to me?
Why was I seeing a doctor?
I had an affair.
You were angry at me.
Closing time.
The pool is now closed.
How most unfortunate it is that we were forced to seek you out here.
You know how uncomfortable we find all this moisture.
I' m sorry. l --
Failed to report in, yes?
I was frightened.
I have a weak heart, you know.
Your weakness is not, we think, an affair of the heart.
We found this in his hotel room.
Must we reproduce Mr Murdoch' s memories again?
I tried to imprint him, but he woke up.
He has no memories, then?
Only fragments.
The procedure, it was interrupted.
I guess it' s only a matter of rounding him up.
You have had strays before, right?
This is no stray, Doctor.
This one can tune.
But that' s impossible.
I thought only you had that ability.
You will process another template of the subject' s memories, yes?
Of course.
I' il imprint him again.
We require them for a quite different purpose.
It' s almost midnight, Dr Schreber.
We' il talk again after tonight' s tuning, but no more delays, yes?
No more inconsistencies in your behaviour.
I know.
I saw the papers.
"Killer Stalks City' s Streetwalkers."
I was with one of those women before I came here tonight.
I don' t understand.
I met her outside an automat.
I guess I wanted to test myself.
I wanted to know if I had it in me to do those things.
Maybe I have lost my mind, but whoever I am, I' m still me, and I' m not a killer.
I believe you.
You do?
The car outside, the one you arrived in.
It' s a cop.
He dropped me off here.
Hold it right there, mister!
Wait.
You have the wrong man.
Stand aside, will you, please?
I didn' t kill anyone.
Right now all you are is a suspect.
Turn yourself in.
I' il listen to whatever you have to say.
You' re not gonna believe what I have to say.
Try me.
There' s someone after me.
There' s this group of men.
They want me dead.
And I don' t even know --
They' re not even --
Yeah, who' s gonna listen to a madman?
Stand aside, Mrs Murdoch.
Run!
No one ever listens to me.
Murdoch, stop!
How much further?
We' re almost there, buddy.
You' re kidding.
Me and the missus spent our honeymoon there.
All you gotta do is take Main Street West to...
Or is it the cross...
You know, that' s funny.
I can' t seem to remember if it' s Main Street West or the cross- town.
I' m sorry, lnspector,
I cannot be of more assistance, but I am running late for an appointment.
Well, I appreciate your taking the time.
There' s just one thing that puzzles me.
I' ve met quite a few murderers in the course of my work.
Murdoch doesn' t strike me as one.
Perhaps you are not accustomed to digging deep enough.
I do know when someone is lying to me, Doctor.
lnspector, judging personalities happens to be my business.
Well, maybe you could give me a few pointers.
Certainly.
Let' s take you, for instance.
You are a fastidious man, driven.
Consumed by details.
I would say your life is rather lonely.
Good evening, lnspector.
I really must be going.
- Kate.
How is he?
The same.
Walenski.
It' s me, Frank.
Come in, Frank.
Close the door.
I' ve been looking through some of your old reports.
It' s an interesting case.
The kind that can make a man' s career... or break it.
Yeah, I was on that case.
And then what?
What happened then, Eddie?
Nothing happened, Frank.
I' ve just been spending time on the subway, riding in circles.
Thinking in circles.
There' s no way out.
I' ve been over every inch of this city.
You' re scaring your wife to death, Eddie.
She' s not my wife.
I don' t know who any of us are.
What makes you say that?
Do you think about the past much, Frank?
See, I' ve been trying to remember things -- clearly remember things from my past.
But the more I try to think back, the more it all starts to unravel.
None of it seems real.
Somebody totally different.
You saw something, didn' t you, Eddie?
Something to do with the case.
There is no case.
There never was!
It' s all just a big joke!
It' s a joke!
Tonight' s requirements are 12 family photo albums, 9 personal diaries, 17 love letters, assorted childhood photographs, 26 wallets,
These do bring back memories.
This one is still warm.
What is it?
The recollections of a great lover?
A catalogue of conquests?
We will soon find out.
You wouldn' t appreciate that, would you,
Mr Whatever your name is?
Not the sort of conquests you would ever understand.
Let' s see.
A touch of unhappy childhood.
And last, but not least, a tragic death in the family.
Mr Book.
Why does Murdoch not sleep during the tuning as the others do?
Maybe he' s a step up the evolutionary ladder.
A freak of nature.
He' s adapting to survive.
What do you expect?
Weren' t you looking for the human soul?
That' s the purpose of your little zoo, isn' t it?
That' s why you keep changing people and things around every night.
Maybe you have finally found what you are looking for, and it' s going to bite you on your --
It requires several of your lifetimes to master our gifts.
The idea that a simple man could develop the ability to tune --
ls absurd, I know, but what other explanation is there?
It is time.
Shut it down.
Frederickson says he' il take me off the damn night shift soon.
Well, it' s about time, dear.
Hello?
Wake up.
Wake up!
Can anybody hear me?!
Let the tuning commence.
The Goodwins.
Jeremy, Sylvia,
Jane and little Matthew.
Jane and little Matthew.
The rich get richer.
Probably have maid' s quarters before the night is through.
Dr Schreber, I presume.
It' s you.
Hey, come on.
lf that' s what you are, huh, Doctor?
Mr Murdoch, please --
Why is everyone asleep?
Please keep your voice down.
Why can' t I remember anything?
What have you done to me?
Please, I want to help you.
We can' t talk here.
lf they see us together --
I don' t care.
I want some answers.
I want some answers now!
Who are they?
Why are they trying to kill me?
Answer me!
My God.
You really can do it.
I did that?
You have their power.
You can make things happen by will alone.
They call it tuning.
That is how they make the buildings change.
A reflex.
But I can teach you to control your power consciously.
Let me help you, John.
We can take the city back.
My glasses.
lollygagging around as he did.
I was going to have to let him go.
And well you should have, darling.
He attacked me.
I don' t know where he has gone.
Come, Dr Schreber.
We have much to do.
Yes?
Yes.
Tonight' s experiment shall be conducted in the following locations.
The first subject shall be imprinted here on Avenue M.
Mr Book, there is a problem.
There is no Avenue M.
We were unable to complete it.
During the last tuning, we detected a lack of control.
An opposing influence on the machines?
Then this man Murdoch is more powerful than we thought.
He' s becoming like us.
So we must become like him.
The good doctor has done as we asked.
Volume 2.
We must not do this.
Murdoch does not possess these memories, yes?
How will his imprint allow us to find him?
Everywhere he goes, everyone he seeks out will be known to us.
And as he follows the clues, so shall we follow the memories.
But to imprint one of us.
Failure has always resulted.
What Mr Hand proposes is our only option.
lmprint.
This may sting a bit.
ls it done?
Oh, yes, Mr Book.
I have John Murdoch... in mind.
"Johnny...
"I found this postcard among your mother' s things.
"Brings back memories, doesn' t it?
"Stop by sometime.
"another mermaid.
Karl. "
Karl.
Karl Harris.
Harris.
Excuse me.
Can you tell me the way to Avenue C?
Try the subway.
You got a problem, pal?
You, uh, been working here long?
25 years, no days off for good behaviour.
We' re looking for John Murdoch.
She knows nothing, Mr Hand.
A dead end, yes, Mr Wall.
We thought his imprint would allow us to track him, yes, but instead we have been brought here.
This is irrational.
lnstincts are irrational, Mr Wall, and we must follow where they lead, yes.
Mr Sleep suggests he may go to places familiar, his job.
He does not care about our job.
lndulge us, Mr Hand.
lf you were Murdoch --
I would remember how my wife had hurt me by sleeping with another man.
I would look for a way to hurt her in return.
Leave me alone with her.
There' s work to be done.
All change, platform 3.
All change?
How do I get to the end of the line?
You want the express.
How come that train didn' t stop?
That' s the express.
There' s no way out, you know?
You can' t get out of the city.
Believe me, I' ve tried.
You' re Murdoch, aren' t you?
The one they' ve been looking for.
You' re not a killer.
like everyone else in this place.
Who are you?
Used to be a cop.
At least, in this life, I was.
They steal people' s memories, you know?
Then they swap them around between us.
Back and forth, back and forth, till no one knows who they are anymore.
How do you know all this?
Once in a while, one of us wakes up while they' re changing things.
It' s not supposed to happen, but it does.
It happened to me.
They' il come looking for you, Murdoch.
Just like they' il come looking for me.
But that' s OK.
I figured a way out.
They were here.
Last night.
This was to be his home.
That was when we loved her.
This is all well and good, Mr Hand, but we require a more practical link to his present whereabouts.
And I know where to find her.
We' re very lucky, when you think about it.
I' m sorry?
To be able to revisit those places which have meant so very much to us.
I thought it was more that we were haunted by them.
Perhaps.
There used to be a ferry when I was a boy, biggest thing you ever saw.
Lit up like a floating birthday cake.
That' s just what my husband once said to me on this very spot.
Where is your husband now?
I wish I knew.
What brings you here?
I met my wife at this place.
It' s where I first met my husband.
Small world.
Hello?
What are you doing here?
I' ve been following you.
Hold it right there!
Johnny?
It' s been so damn long,
I thought you' d forgotten your uncle Karl.
You son of a gun!
Uncle Karl?
Wait.
Yeah.
Shell Beach is where I grew up?
That' s what I said.
Shell Beach, your hometown.
I need to get there, Karl.
How do I get there?
I don' t know.
Come on.
You must remember.
You gotta have some idea.
Uh, sorry, Johnny.
The old cracker barrel ain' t what it used to be.
So bright there.
Brighter times, I guess.
You were always scribbling in that damn book.
Ha!
What a couple of handsome fools.
What happened to my parents?
Where are they now?
They' re dead, Johnny.
They died when their house burned down.
I looked after you.
You don' t remember that, really?
Huh?
What is that?
What' s the scar?
You burnt your arm pretty bad in the fire.
What does it mean, Johnny?
It means these are all lies!
My husband told me he' d been here.
He told me he wanted to test himself, see if he was... capable of...
I wanted to talk to her.
I thought maybe she could help me find him.
I' m gonna call the station.
It' s beautiful.
It was a gift from my mother.
She died recently.
I keep it with me to remind me of her.
I' m sorry.
I can' t remember when she gave it to me.
How do you think I could forget a thing like that?
What' s happening, lnspector?
I' m not sure I know anymore.
I left your old room like it was.
You can sleep here tonight, huh?
Glad to have you back, Johnny, even if it is for just a night.
Karl.
Why, sure.
That clock' s kept perfect time since I bought it.
A. m. or p. m.?
What do you think, Johnny?
How can it be night already?
What happened to the day?
How' d I miss it?
You' re tired.
Anything' s possible.
Look, uh... get some sleep.
We' il... straighten all this out tomorrow.
Oh, come on.
Emma, he' s here.
He' s acting mighty peculiar.
I know.
He' s not himself.
I' il try.
Thanks, Karl.
Bye.
I can' t promise anything, Mrs Murdoch.
We just have to play it as it comes.
Ha.
Karl.
Uncle Karl.
Johnny, if you' re in some kind of trouble, well, maybe we could do something.
Haven' t seen you in so long.
Mr Murdoch... you' ve been the cause of much distress.
Start talking.
There' s no need for this.
There' s no escape.
The city' s ours.
We made it.
What are you talking about?
We fashioned this city on stolen memories, different eras, different pasts, all rolled into one.
Each night, we revise it, refine it in order to learn.
Learn what?
About you, Mr Murdoch, you and your fellow inhabitants, what makes you human.
Why?!
We need to be like you.
I understand you now, Mr Murdoch.
I remember that which you do not, what you' ve been missing.
The ocean, yes...
Running along the waves as a child, meeting Emma at the river, that first kiss that followed.
What are you?
You' ve seen what we are.
We use your dead as vessels.
Get in!
What about her?
Ring any bells?
She was alive when I left her.
What about this?
I...
It must mean something, all those pictures.
What pictures?
I don' t understand this.
Stop playing games with me, Murdoch!
Stop telling me lies!
I am not telling you lies!
Help me out here.
Make me understand.
I have this jigsaw puzzle in front of my face, and every time I try to rearrange the pieces, it still doesn' t make any sense.
You think it makes sense to me?
I' m as much in the dark here as you are.
You let me ask you a question?
Sure.
Know how to get there?
Yeah.
Can you tell me?
You just, uh...
You go to the...
Where do you go?
Just give me a second, will ya?
You can' t remember, can you?
Hmm?
Wait.
I got a better one for you.
When was the last time you remember doing something during the day?
What do you mean?
I just mean... during the day.
Daylight.
When was the last time you remember seeing it?
And I' m not talking about some distant, half- forgotten childhood memory.
Last week?
When?
Can you come up with a single memory?
You know something?
I don' t think the sun even... exists... in this place.
'Cause I' ve been up for hours and hours and hours, and the night never ends here.
That is crazy.
You' re damn right this is crazy.
Listen to me, Bumstead.
It' s not just me.
It' s all of us.
They' re doing something to all of us.
Shut up.
Please listen.
Shut up!
Shut up!
There has to be an explanation for this somewhere.
Explain this.
John, I' m so sorry.
I never meant to hurt you, John, and I did it, and I don' t know why I did it.
I wish I could take it all back.
Emma... you didn' t do it.
This... affair of yours, whatever it is, the thing you' re supposed to have done, you didn' t do it.
I don' t believe it ever happened.
What do you mean?
I know this is gonna sound crazy, but what if we never knew each other before now?
What if the first time we ever met was last night in your -- in our apartment, and everything you remember... and everything that I' m supposed to remember never really happened?
Someone just wants us to think it did.
But how can that be true?
I so vividly remember meeting you.
I remember falling in love with you.
I remember losing you.
No, wait, wait.
Please, just... just one more minute.
I love you, John.
You can' t fake something like that.
No, you can' t.
lnspector?
Sir?
Detective Walenski killed himself last night.
I, um... kind of thought you should know.
Oh, and... the chief wanted to see you.
Sir...
I knew you' d track the killer down, sir.
Shoelace.
You can sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
I knew you' d come eventually.
Don' t you think it' s about time you started giving me some answers?
Yes, of course.
Won' t you please sit down?
l -- I come here quite often.
I' m allowed a moment' s peace.
You -- you see, they have an aversion to -- to water.
One could almost call it a phobia.
Who are they?
What do they want from me?
Right.
Well, for now, let' s just say... that you were the subject of their experiment.
W- we all are.
But we do not have much time, and I cannot afford the luxury of doing this the right way.
Everything you need to know, all the answers, are in this syringe.
I need you to inject yourself.
It' s the only way to make you understand.
You' re kidding me, right?
We' re running out of time, John.
You have to do this now.
Give me the gun, Doctor.
lnspector, he is more disturbed than we thought.
I may not be the judge of personality that you are, Doctor, but you' re the one who looks disturbed to me.
You do not know what you are doing.
Doctor?
All the answers you' ve been looking for, John,
I swear to you.
Guess I' il just have to... hold on to it for... safekeeping, if you don' t mind.
Let' s go, Doctor.
Go?
Where are we going?
Shell Beach.
That' s where you want to go, isn' t it?
The ocean.
I promise you!
I' ve been there, and --
lf you' ve been there, you can show us the way, then, can' t you?
I won' t.
You can' t make me go there!
Don' t you understand?
They' il be waiting for us.
I don' t understand.
Used to be a bridge here.
Try that again, your friends are gonna be fishing you out of the canal.
Just don' t hurt me.
I' il tell you everything.
It doesn' t matter anymore anyway.
What?
Who are you people?
We must go to the end of the canal.
We will give you some more pretty things soon... Anna.
I' m not Anna.
You will be soon, yes.
I have another use for her first.
I call them... the strangers.
They abducted us and brought us here.
The city, everyone in it... is their experiment.
They mix and match our memories as they see fit, trying to divine what makes us unique.
One day, a man might be an inspector.
The next, someone entirely different.
When they want to study a murder, for instance, they simply imprint one of their citizens with a new personality, arrange a family for him, friends, an entire history, even a lost wallet.
Then they observe the results.
Will a man, given the history of a killer, continue in that vein, or are we, in fact, more than the mere sum of our memories?
This business of you being a killer was an unhappy coincidence.
You have had dozens of lives before now.
You just happened to wake up while I was imprinting you with this one.
Why are they doing all of this?
It is our capacity for individuality, our souls that makes us different from them.
They think they can find the human soul if they understand how our memories work.
All they have are collective memories.
They share one group mind.
They' re dying, you see?
Their entire race is on the brink of extinction.
They think we can save them.
Where do I fit in?
You are different, John.
You resisted my attempt to imprint you.
Somehow you have developed their ability to tune.
That is how they built this city.
They have machines very deep beneath the surface that allow them to focus their telepathic energies.
They control everything here, even the sun.
That' s why it' s always dark.
They can' t stand the light.
So why do they need you?
When they first brought us here, they extracted what was in us.
So they could store the information, remix it like so much paint, and give us back new memories of their choosing.
But they still needed an artist to help them.
I understood the intricacies of the human mind better than they ever could, so they allowed me to keep my skills as a scientist, because they needed them.
But they made me delete everything else.
Can you imagine what it is like being forced to erase your own past?
What about my past?
What about my childhood?
Shell Beach, Uncle Karl.
What about this?
This was blank when I found it!
You still don' t understand, John.
You were never a boy, not in this place.
Your entire history is an illusion, a fabrication, as it is with all of us.
You made those drawings happen with your gift.
You say they brought us here.
From where?
I' m sorry.
I don' t remember.
None of us remember that, what we once were, what we might have been... somewhere else.
I' ve taken you this far.
You don' t need me anymore.
Let' s go.
There is no ocean, John.
There is nothing beyond the city.
The only place home exists... is in your head.
John, stop!
Please!
And now you know the truth.
You' il allow yourself to surrender, Mr Murdoch, or it will result in this one' s death, yes?
What do I care?
She' s not my real wife!
But you do still care, don' t you, Mr Murdoch?
You see, I have become the monster you were intended to be.
Shall I end her life now as you would have?
Don' t hurt her, please!
Then surrender, Mr Murdoch.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Kill him.
- Kill him!
Dangerous.
What the doctor calls the soul.
It is time for our experiment to move into a final phase.
We no longer need the other subjects.
The time for study is over.
It is time to be one with John Murdoch.
It is time, Doctor.
lmprint.
Shut it down!
Shut it down forever!
What are you doing?
They want to imprint you with their own collective memories.
They want to make you one of them so they can share your soul.
But I' ve got other plans.
lmprint, Doctor.
No more disobedience.
I' m sorry, John.
The pain will only last a moment.
John.
You' il rise to greater heights than that, my boy.
One day when you' re older, you' il understand.
Remember.
That' s it, John.
Practice makes perfect.
Remember what I told you.
Never talk to strangers.
John, remember.
You' re wondering why I keep appearing in your memories.
It is because I have inserted myself in them.
Only, these memories have been fabricated to teach you about the strangers.
Give you a lifetime of knowledge in a single syringe.
You will survive, John.
You will find strength within yourself, and you will prevail.
Remember.
- Hi, Uncle Karl.
- Johnny!
You' re getting the hang of it, John.
Maybe one day I' il be working for you.
This is the machine the strangers use to amplify their thoughts.
The machine that changes their world.
You must take control of it.
You must make the machine yours.
But you must concentrate.
Something' s wrong.
There is no time for romance, John.
The world can be what you make it.
What have you done?
You have the power to make anything happen, but you must act now!
I knew you could do it, John.
You have their power now.
You control their machines.
Where' s Emma?
She is not Emma anymore, John.
She has been reimprinted.
I can' t.
The facility where the strangers stored the memories has been destroyed.
I' m sorry.
What are you going to do now, John?
I' m gonna fix things.
You told me I had the power, didn' t you?
I can make these machines do anything I want.
Make this world anything I want it to be.
Just so long as I concentrate hard enough.
Where are you going?
Shell Beach.
- What' s the fare?
- Quarter.
Oh, please.
Oh, no.
Thank you.
Been waiting for you, yes?
What are you doing?
I' m just making a few little changes around here is all.
Are we sure that' s what we want?
I' m prepared to take my chances.
I' m dying, John.
Your imprint is not agreeable with my kind.
But I wanted to know what it was like... how you feel.
You know how I was supposed to feel.
That person isn' t me.
Never was.
You wanted to know what it was about us that made us human.
Well, you' re not going to find it... in here.
You went looking in the wrong place.
It' s so beautiful here.
So bright.
Do you know if Shell Beach is around here?
I think that' s it just over there.
I' m headed that way myself.
Would you like to join me?
Sure.
John.
37 minutes and 15 seconds.
I' m gonna stay within a 30- mile area of the cabin.
Excuse me, miss.
Yes, I' m sorry to bother you.
I' m looking for the post office.
You are?
Would you like me to give you a lift?
What?
Please.
Please.
Oh, shit!
Excuse me, I just...
Hi, Dad.
- What are you reading?
- Nothing.
Wuthering Heights?
"Catherine, is it not sufficient that while you' re at peace...... I shall ride in the torments of hell?"
Denise.
It' s romantic!
If they can put it in a book, it' s not.
Romance has to be secret.
Do you have a girlfriend?
I mean, fixing the cabin...
I' m not stupid, you know.
I wouldn' t blame you for cheating on Mother.
That' s not a nice thing to say, is it?
Got your nose.
Haven' t you ever played Got Your Nose?
Don' t make a face when you see it.
Imagine it fixed up.
Daddy?
How many stars are there?
They' re infinite.
There are so many...... and so far away...... that they can' t be counted.
You' d never get to the end.
Ever?
Ever.
You hungry?
Open the picnic basket.
It' s all right.
They' re only spiders.
They can' t hurt you.
Hey, Barney!
Hi, Stan!
Were you here at your place last night?
- Yeah, why?
- I thought I heard screams.
Like a child.
I didn' t hear a thing.
Have a nice day.
Miss, can you tell me how to get to the post office?
Yeah, sure.
You go straight down, about a mile.
- It' s off Handley.
- That' s what I couldn' t remember.
Thanks.
Are you going that way?
- I can give you a lift.
- No, it' s okay.
Excuse me.
3: 05.
One- eighty.
- Excuse me, miss?
- Go away.
- Can you tell me how to...?
- Don' t bother me!
3: 44.
Ninety- five.
Are you having an affair?
I love you.
I love Denise.
I know you think restoring this cabin is a crazy idea...... but what if it' s not?
What if I' m learning about myself...... realizing that if I can do this, I can do anything?
So I take a step.
I think, "Is this crazy?
Should I stop? "
Then I think:
"Not yet.
There' s always time to turn back...... if I want to. "
So I take another step...... and another...... and another...... until one day I realize that...... I' ve crossed that line...... and there' s no turning back.
Let' s get out of here.
- What?
This is what we came for.
- Let' s go.
We didn' t drive from Seattle just to go back home.
Please?
- Where do you wanna go?
- Nowhere.
- Don' t sulk.
- I' m not sulking.
We' re on vacation.
Okay.
There must be other disaster areas to go to.
- What was that?
- Nothing.
- Oh, come on!
- Shit!
Shit!
I don' t believe this.
I told you we needed gas.
- It happened, okay?
- It' s not okay.
Why are you so upset?
Nobody can see us until they are on top of us!
Why didn' t you stop?
We passed 10 places!
They can see us fine, okay, Diane?
Oh, God!
No!
- Just calm down.
- Should we push it?
- Let' s go.
I' il get the flashlight.
- Flashlight?
- Find it!
- What are you gonna do with it?
- You go.
You' il never find anything in that mess.
- Jeff, I' il find it!
- I' m going!
Jeff, don' t leave me alone!
Diane?
I lost my head.
I don' t know why I did it.
I love you.
I' m sorry.
That' s 15 bucks.
Thanks.
There.
Okay, let' s go home.
No, park the car.
Park the car.
What?
Now repeat after me.
I...
- I...
- I...... Jeff Harriman...... Jeff Harriman...... swear that the wonderful...... swear that the wonderful...... the exquisite and sweet...
- The always sweet Diane Shaver...
That makes it feel so official.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- Mm- hm.
I have a present for you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
This is great!
I wanted to give it to you tonight, but...
I screwed it up.
"Forever, Diane."
I don' t smoke.
For you to light my cigarette.
- What?
- I wanna drive.
I have to go to the bathroom.
You want anything?
Soda pop, beer?
That' d be great.
Diane?
What the hell is taking her so long?
Oh, the keys.
Hey!
This is the ladies' room!
Diane!
Diane!
I' m looking for my girlfriend.
I' ve got a picture I took today.
She' s wearing this.
- Yes, I did see her.
- When?
Half- hour ago.
She was over by the lotto machine.
Was she alone?
Did she talk to anyone?
You know how many people pass through here?
No cutting in line!
My girlfriend' s disappeared.
Has anyone seen her?
Please.
Anybody?
We pulled in, we got gas.
We then parked in that space.
She came into the store.
That' s when she disappeared.
Did you fight recently?
Wasn' t a fight.
It was a thing.
- A thing?
- Don' t you have a girlfriend?
Yeah, and if I think something' s just a thing...... you can bet she' il think it' s a fight.
I' il make a report, but give it 24 hours...
No, listen to me!
She has disappeared!
Something happened to her.
It' s not a lovers' quarrel.
I urge you to move your face back to where it was.
Now, I know you' re upset.
If I get information indicating foul play, I' il proceed.
But for now, you better go home.
That' s it?
He' s a complete failure.
I know, but probably not a total lost cause.
Please, I just...
Look, he put up a new one.
I heard him on the radio.
Every month he replaces the posters.
You can set your watch.
He must' ve loved her very much.
I do admire his perseverance.
- Night of the living dead.
- I' il get him.
No, this is your second double this week.
You got something more interesting?
Mel Gibson doesn' t call.
I know that guy.
From where, prison?
High school.
I' il go get him, okay?
Tough night?
Coffee, please.
You really think you need it?
You got luggage under those eyes.
I' il bring you milk.
I don' t want milk.
I' d like coffee, please.
How much sleep did you get last night?
Night before, night before that?
One milk, coming up.
How long have you worked here?
Since the dawn of man.
Rita, bring me those checks.
My friend disappeared between Mount St. Helens and Seattle.
That' s about 60 miles from here.
I know.
What does your friend look like?
I know this is really crazy, but I think...
If I remembered everyone who came in, I' d be a freak of nature.
She' s beautiful.
Yeah, I know.
What' s your name?
Jeff.
- Don' t worry about it.
It' s okay.
I' m not letting you get into a car like this.
There' s a nice, big cot in the back.
- Let me sit for a minute...
- You can' t drive like this.
- You should be in bed.
- I' il be all right.
What do you do now?
I was a copywriter, but I lost my job.
- I' m sorry.
- No.
No, I' m writing a novel.
I couldn' t do that if I was still one.
Why don' t you take my number?
Don' t give it to strangers.
I slept with you, at least in the same room.
- Give me your arm.
Turn around.
- What are you doing?
- Just relax, here.
Did it crack?
Is it better?
I gotta clear more space.
Look what I found.
Why don' t you talk about her anymore?
1 topic.
What' s the point?
To wind up all frustrated?
- It' s weird how things just fade away.
- It' s not faded.
Your stuff is in the top drawer.
What' s in those boxes?
More crossword puzzles?
Those aren' t crossword puzzles.
They' re anagrams.
That' s really important.
It' s mostly old stuff.
Just high school yearbooks.
- Really?
I wanna see.
- Now?
We have some unfinished business.
Don' t go through my stuff.
Rita!
- You okay?
- No.
- What is this?
It almost killed me.
- It' s nothing.
It' s for protection.
There' s a lot of psychos around.
It' s loaded.
That' s usually what psychos respond to, honey.
Why didn' t you tell me we have a gun?
You just moved in.
You also have to bang on the faucet.
Let' s get one thing straight, okay?
No secrets, Jeff.
In the heart, on the lips.
Rita, I need it.
Fine.
Thank you.
No more secrets, I promise, okay?
One night when you' re asleep, I' m going to chuck that gun.
I' m sorry.
This is for Jeff Harriman.
It' s Arthur Bernard.
- On a Sunday night?
- Who' s he?
A publisher.
I gave him my book.
- Wait!
Hold on.
I need to talk to you.
Hello?
Arthur.
Yes, Jeff Harriman.
I' m sorry, Jeff.
I' m afraid it' s not for us.
But it' s very good.
Very talented.
I see.
Don' t look so destroyed.
We' d like you to write something else for us.
- Like an assignment?
- Exactly.
That would be great.
I remember when your girlfriend' s disappearance was in the news.
That was terrible.
I was in Tacoma at a wedding, and I saw your posters.
I' d forgotten all about it, but you' re still looking.
- Yes, I am.
- I want your story, Jeff.
The whole thing.
What do you say?
I' ve been trying to put that behind me.
Oh, I' m sorry.
What happened?
I' m gonna be able to pay the rent now.
- He liked it?
- He loved it.
That' s great!
That' s great!
- Let' s go celebrate.
- Okay.
It' s about us, isn' t it?
You can tell me.
I don' t mind.
Let' s go to bed.
Excuse me.
How much is that uniform?
What time is it?
Seven o' clock.
You have to go?
It' s only one weekend a month.
Does your mom know you joined?
She filled out the application.
Go back to sleep.
See you tomorrow night.
I' m Paul McGraw.
Tonight my guest is the courageous and tormented Jeff Harriman.
- Welcome to our show.
- Thank you.
In the years Diane' s been missing, any new clues?
Have the kidnappers made any contact?
No, not at all.
And yet here you sit, year after year, trying to find her.
At least to find out what happened.
That must' ve cost a lot of money.
Pretty much everything I have.
Let' s just say the kidnapper is watching.
Anything you' d like to say to him now?
I want to meet you.
I don 't hate you.
I just wanna know what happened to her.
I' m prepared to do anything to find out.
Please.
I need to know.
There.
Measure on the bench.
Goggles.
Don' t you value your eyes?
All right, gather around, please.
The greatest risk the research chemist faces...... is that a contaminant is introduced...... into the experiment...... without his knowledge, rendering the experiment pointless.

Oh, my God!
Room service.
Open up.
The guy at the desk said you' re here.
Is this what you want?
- Take it off.
- Why?
I believe in giving my man what he wants.
You know what?
Call me Diane.
I' il treat you like shit.
Then I' il disappear!
Take it off!
Oh, my God!
No secrets?
Remember, Jeff?
No secrets!
I knew I could never make you understand.
Who are you?
You tell me the truth!
Did you know what you were doing when you went...... from crying to waking up in a sweat from dreaming about her?
Dancing on the balcony?
Was the whole thing planned just to throw me off?
- I didn' t wanna lose you!
- You' re still in love with her!
I' m in love with you.
What are you saying?
I may not be as smart as you, but I' m not a dumb bitch.
- Look at this room!
- No pictures except for the posters!
No mementos, just this!
I love you, Rita!
I cracked the code, Jeff.
I saw the book.
You' re a liar.
I tried not to come.
I almost went back home...... but if I did, I' d just pack up and go.
Why didn' t you?
Because I don' t know how not to fight.
Nobody in my family ever fought for anything.
They wound up on Prozac and sleeping all day...... or dead from liver disease at 35.
That' s not gonna happen to me, Jeff.
I fight!
It' s not her, Rita.
It hasn' t been for a very long time.
Then what is it?
It' s it.
It' s not knowing.
I pretend I have a choice.
Either to let her go on living wherever she is...... and never know what happened...... or she can be dead, and I get to find out everything.
So I let her die.
I swear to God, I wish she were dead.
You don' t know what it is like to not know.
Shit.
I' m sorry.
But I don' t know what to do.
I do.
I haven' t been to the gas station since.
He put them up.
I never went back myself.
Then it' s time you did.
Come on.
Till death do us part.
She' s gone, Jeff.
Gone.
You may never find out how or why.
You have to accept that.
If Diane were here right now...... I' d ask you to marry me.
It' s you I love, I swear.
But if it were possible to choose right now...... I' d rather be back at this gas station...... so I' d find out what happened.
It' s not good enough.
If you ever wanna move on with your life...... if you wanna be just alive again...... then this is your last chance.
I love you...... but you must decide to be with me, or I' m gone.
Let her go, Jeff.
Let her go.
Diane.
"Meet me alone...... at the yacht club."
Hey.
Read it.
Come on.
He' s watching me.
I can feel it.
My fear was that he was dead.
But there are things in this letter only he could know.
Jeff, he' s seen your picture in the paper.
He wants to see how far you' il go.
He' s loving this.
No, look.
He signed it.
Barney.
- You think that' s his real name?
- That' s not the point.
You' re right.
The point is, what am I doing here?
It' s never gonna change.
It' il just go on until you end up as crazy.
This letter' s the first break I' ve had.
I can nail this fucker!
Go to the police!
You can' t do this on your own!
The police?
They laugh at me.
I' m a joke to them.
I' m starting to see their point.
- Don' t do this to me, not now!
- Jesus Christ, you are amazing!
Did it occur to you that she doesn' t wanna be found?
Goodbye, Jeff.
Run like a coward.
At least Diane was taken by force.
I am not Diane!
You' ve reached Jeff Harriman and his twisted ego.
She' s left Jeff.
She' s moving out, and she will not be found here again.
So don' t look for me, forever.
You reached Jeff Harriman and Jeff' s twisted ego.
She has left Jeff.
Rita!
Rita?
Oh, shit.
Hi, you' ve reached 555- 8767.
Please leave a message.
Hello, Jeff.
I' m the man you' re looking for.
I' m Barney.
Son of a bitch!
What did you do with her?
Where is she?
What did you do with her?
Tell me!
Where is she, Barney?
Kill me if you want.
You have every right.
Beat me to a bloody pulp.
But if I die, you' il never know.
- I' m sorry.
Were you done?
- Tell me where she is!
There' s only one way for you to find out.
- How?
- One.
How?
Come with me.
Where?
In my car for a drive.
To where?
Diane?
Come with me.
Tell me, is she dead?
I' m offering you this one chance...... to find out everything.
I warn you, I' ve taken precautions.
If anything happens to me, or if you speak to anyone...... you' il never know what happened.
I' m leaving now...... with or without you.
I' il go with you, but you take me to Diane!
Shit!
He' d be such a great guy.
If he wasn' t monumentally fucked up.
Lynn, come here, come here.
I hope he hasn' t changed it.
Listen to the message.
You' ve reached...
- He changed it.
- Leave him a message!
- Wait a minute.
Hello, Jeff.
- What?
I' m who you' re looking for.
- Oh, my God!
- I' m Barney.
- What?
- Oh, my God!
Hungry?
I hope you like roast beef.
I' ve thought a lot about meeting you.
- I' ve wanted to right from the start.
- Did you rape her?
I' m not a rapist.
It' s important that you understand that.
Then what did you do to her?
Let me tell you a story.
When I was 15, it was an ordinary day...
I don' t wanna hear your damn story.
I couldn' t give a shit.
I wanna know what happened to her.
Then you' il want to listen to the story.
You want to listen carefully.
Sometimes the devil is in the details.
Now, once, when I was 15...... it was an ordinary day...... with my ordinary home and my ordinary life.
Something willed me to the edge of the balcony.
I wondered if I had the courage to jump.
I kept waiting for something to stop me.
Anything.
But nothing did.
And so I jumped.
Everybody has had that thought at one time, but I did it.
Why?
Because you' re a nut case.
I wanna know where Diane is!
You' re still not listening.
The answer will slip by you.
Go on.
I lead a very normal life.
I work.
I have a home.
But then, one day...... on vacation with my family in California...
There' s a little girl in the water!
Hurry!
She' s drowning!
Wow!
I jumped in without thinking, just like when I was 15.
Once again, nothing stopped me.
I didn 't want to save her.
I wanted to be a hero for my daughter.
You' re the bravest man in the world.
I love you, Daddy.
In that moment, she thought I was a god.
That would make most people feel great, but I panicked.
- What does this have to do with Diane?
- Diane was an experiment.
Saving a life made me a hero, but did it make me a good person?
I had to prove to myself beyond a doubt...... that I was as capable of evil as I was of heroism.
Real evil.
Or I wouldn' t deserve my daughter' s love.
You' re fucking insane.
You killed Diane.
For me, to kill is not the worst thing that I could imagine.
There' s more to know.
I won' t say a word.
You won' t because if you do you won' t get what you need.
- Something wrong, officer?
- You have a broken taillight.
I don' t know what to say.
There' s nothing criminal on the tape.
We' il conduct a search, but he has to be missing 24 hours first.
Twenty- four hours?
What is this?
Gotta give out parking tickets first?
Lynn, please.
How much have you had to drink?
One after another.
Get that taillight fixed.
Will do.
Thank you.
Drive safely.
- Problem?
- Your seat belt.
- I' m claustrophobic.
- Just put it on.
Yes, sir.
Miss Carmichael?
It' s Rita!
Are you there?
Please come to the door!
I need to talk to you!
Magically delicious.
Miss Carmichael!
Can you come to the door?
What' s the ruckus?
You' re gonna wake Elvis.
Great.
Miss Carmichael, this is very important.
Did you see Jeff here today?
Did you see anything unusual?
- You mean the fight with Barney?
- Yes!
What fight?
Tell me about it.
Nothing to tell.
Your boyfriend was whopping that man' s head...... got in the car with him and drove off.
Oh, God!
Okay, what else?
Do you remember anything else?
Yes, come to think of it, I do.
- Something odd.
- What?
In the middle of everything...... that leprechaun popped off my Lucky Charms box...... and started dancing around.
"Magically delicious!"
Thank you.
If you wanna know the license plate number of the car, let me know.
Wait, wait, wait.
It' s very urgent.
Please!
I' il be one minute.
One minute.
Please?
Thanks.
Sir, my car was stolen.
- Your car was stolen?
The license plate is 155INY.
I' ve already been to the police.
Mrs. Cousins?
Helene Cousins?
Yes...
You may still have my old address.
1804 Northwest Everett Drive.
- Seattle.
- New one.
Thanks.
You gotta fill out this form.
I was having no success.
My methods needed to be rethought.
And then...... my family gave me a little party on my birthday.
Okay, move in.
Right, little closer.
Smile!
- Happy birthday, Barney.
Blow out the candles, Daddy.
Thank you.
Forever.
More?
I' m afraid to open it.
Let' s see.
What happened to me?
- What happened, Daddy?
- You fell off the balcony.
And that' s when it dawned on me.
It wasn 't the lure that had to be stronger.
I had to be weaker.
Excuse me.
I' ve opened mine with a barrette a million times.
- This way?
- Yes.
Bless you.
Excuse me.
I have to go to the men' s room.
I don' t feel so well.
I' d given up for the day.
It was comical.
I didn' t trust myself not to laugh the next time.
Fate, Jeff.
If I hadn 't sneezed...
- I' m sorry.
- Quite all right.
I was just wondering if you had five singles.
Three ones.
Just a normal single you could trade me for my mangled one.
Thank you.
Could you...?
Sorry.
Thank you.
Okay, now let' s see if this works.
This is your lucky day.
I can feel it.
Thank you.
That' s a beautiful bracelet.
Thank you.
That' s the symbol for infinity.
I suppose it means it' il stay forever.
Well, it' s a nice thought.
My boyfriend would really appreciate something like that.
Where' d you get that?
I rep them.
I handle sales for the whole Northwest Territory.
Wow!
If you promise not to tell the next time you' re in Paris...... I' il let you have a sample for cost.
- They' re in my car.
- Really?
With a new product...... it' s a good idea to have people seen wearing it around town.
- Twenty- two bucks.
- That' s cheap.
If I told you the markup we get for these, you' d die.
You want one?
Yes.
Right this way.
There they are.
Please.
They' re called "tiles" in French?
That' s the name of the company.
Teels.
Un tile infinity, please.
Could you get in and give me a hand?
- Get in?
- Yes.
Why did you make contact with me?
Because you asked.
The way you searched for Diane.
Such a worthy opponent.
A kindred spirit.
You don' t meet many men who refuse to give up or be dominated.
Most just crouch frightened in the dark.
Excuse me.
I' m looking for Mr. Cousins.
I saw you come out of his house.
I know who you are.
You do?
Yeah, I saw him watching you this afternoon...... at the restaurant.
Come in out of the damp.
I' m Rita.
I' m Denise.
Are you going to run away together?
It' s complicated.
Where is he now?
- At the cabin.
- The cabin?
I forgot.
Don' t you wanna be together forever?
That' s the symbol for infinity.
I gave it to him on a bracelet for his birthday.
Look, I wanna go to him now.
But I' m not sure I can find my way.
It' s dark.
Can you tell me the way?
Come on.
You can drop me off on the way.
I' m meeting a boy.
Daddy has no idea.
Mother' s asleep.
Daddy says romance has to be secret.
- You won' t tell him, will you?
- No, I won' t tell him.
I wanna know what you did with her.
I' il tell you.
I will keep my promise.
But there' s only one way to do it.
You must experience what she experienced.
What do you mean?
Everything that happened to her, every event from this point on...... you must duplicate exactly.
You' re crazy.
If you do, logic dictates you' il find her.
Alive?
This coffee is drugged.
Judging from your size...... it would take 15 minutes to take effect.
It' il put you out for 40 minutes or so...... the same length of time Diane was out.
You must remain unconscious for us to move on.
So she' s not dead?
Drink.
And afterwards, what?
Drink and you will experience exactly what she experienced.
You don' t understand.
I won' t tell anyone.
I just want to know.
I understand.
And when I put myself in your place, I believe you.
That' s why I don' t need a gun.
Your obsession is my weapon.
It' s like you are my laboratory rat.
You' ve built the cage.
Only now, you can' t escape what you' ve constructed.
If you want to know what happened to her...... you have to go through the same things.
The key chain, I' d like to see it again.
Jeff, look at your life.
You have nothing.
No job.
No money.
No love.
No peace of mind.
It' s been three years of hell.
At what point do you say, "I' m not going to be over this"?
There were nights with Diane I' d pray she' d get into an accident...... just so she' d let me take care of her.
Just so she' d have to stay with me.
You don' t care if she' s alive or dead.
I do.
You' re afraid that you won' t know who you are.
Who is Jeff if he' s not the guy looking for Diane?
Please.
Can you walk away from knowing the answer?
Please, I just wanna know what happened to her.
Drink, Jeff, really.
What choice do you have?
I said I' d show you what happened to Diane...... and I' m a man of my word.
No!
Help!
Diane.
Oh, shit!
Hello, Rita.
I really dislike surprises.
Rita?
It' s me!
Come out.
You can' t possibly win.
You don' t know how.
Your hiding is pointless.
I know these woods inside and out.
They' re like a maze.
You must come out if you want to find Jeff!
That' s why you came, after all.
Where' s Jeff?
Where?
Do what you want.
You' il never know what happened.
If anything happens to me, all you' il have is your same uncertainty.
- Your choice.
- I' il take my chances.
Jeff?!
Jeff!
Jeff, are you here?
Jeff!
Jeff!
Jeff!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Operator 319.
What city, please?
Hello?
Hello?
Feeling strange?
This is silly, Rita.
You can' t fight.
How did you follow us?
Did you see us leave?
The important thing is that it was all Jeff' s choice.
Coming to the restaurant, getting in the car...... drinking the coffee.
He did what he wanted to do.
You' re feeling better, aren' t you?
I know how long the chloroform effects last.
You' il soon be strong enough to fight.
Well, I' m sorry, but...... I' m just not up to it.
And besides...... I have to get home before my wife wakes up.
Tell me what you did to Jeff.
You took your chances.
Is he dead?
I made him a cup of coffee.
It was drugged.
To find out what happened, he had to go through what she did.
And now you must do the same.
This can be easy, or this can be hard.
Your choice.
Don' t worry.
It won' t keep you up.
Tell me, Mr. Cousins.
Have you spoken to your daughter tonight?
What?
How do you know my name?
I know your family' s names, Barney.
Wife, Helene.
Daughter, Denise.
Sweet, innocent, 13- year- old daughter, Denise.
Brown hair, full of secrets.
I' ve got her.
What are you up to?
How were you able to follow us?
Denise knows the way.
I took your daughter tonight to trade for Jeff.
A brave attempt, but we both know it' s not true.
Let' s talk about the mistress she wants you to have.
Wuthering Heights.
Or better yet, let' s talk about infinity.
Helene, it' s me.
Is Denise with you?
Her bed hasn 't been slept in.
I got up to close the windows and she wasn 't there...
That' s right, shithead.
Where is she?
What did you do with her?
If you wanna know, you' il have to go through what she did.
- Drink.
- You can' t be serious.
Try me.
- Lf you think...
- Drink!
Now!
To your health.
Jeff!
God, hold on!
Jeff, hold on!
Hold on!
Jeff, hold on!
Oh, Jesus!
God, be alive!
Be alive.
Be alive!
Rita?
I' ve got 15 minutes to find her, Rita!
- Son of a bitch!
- Where is she?
- You killed him!
- I have no time to mess around!
- Get off of me!
Bastard!
- Tell me where she is!
- Tell me where she is!
- No!
Where is she?
Help!
I' ve got 15 minutes to find her, Rita!
No, don' t!
It' s over.
It' s over.
You all right?
There was a terrific story there before, but now...... I think it' s an out- and- out smash.
- I need for you to write it.
- I don' t think so.
We wanna put the whole thing behind us.
Look, I know I' m being gauche, but I' m a publisher.
Write this book, please.
You won' t regret it.
What do you say?
- No coffee.
- We don' t drink that anymore.
Hey, boy.
Hey, boy!
Come on, boy.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, fella.
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
No more fucking finals!
Hey, don' t do it!
Don' t go to college.
It' s a fucking scam.
It fucking sucks!
- Bert, got any more smokes?
- No.
So I' m fat.
So what?
I hope she' s not anorexic.
Put her there, sport!
What' s the matter?
Cat got your tongue?
- Jesus!
- God damn it, Dennis, no!
No, Dennis, no!
No, don' t hit him or anything.
Everybody knows not to sit next to Dennis.
- He' il give you tetanus.
- Maybe you should make a sign.
There' s a stream around back, if you want to wash your hand.
I' il get you a towel.
Hey, pal,
do you think it' s a smart idea leaving your kid here where he might be a danger to people?
What are you saying exactly?
I' m just saying, if such an incident were to bring about a "lawsuit,"
- Jeff, save it for law school.
Cute kid.
Hey.
What' s your name?
Yeah!
If you' re interested in really good glasswork, it' s cheap, but it' s an antique.
Some of those bottles up there are dated before the Civil War.
And over there, I used to have - in that empty space, I used to have some of the prettiest Shirley Temple bottles I' ve ever seen.
And this woman came in here with the palsy, the poor soul.
She thought they were so cute, and she reached for them and knocked every one down and broke them all to damn pieces.
So I took her in the back and gave her some coke and ammonia.
I thought she was gonna have a spell.
We should get something for your mom to say thanks.
How about some fox piss?
- My mom would love fox piss.
- Oh Lord, don' t drop that.
If you do, that' s powerful stuff.
All the foxes around would come down here.
You' d have friends you' d never had before.
You all here for a vacation?
Yeah, we' re renting a cabin for a week.
That' s nice.
And if you go in the woods...
- be very careful.
- Why, what' s in the woods?
Tommy, get those kids their sandwiches.
They' re all wrapped up.
- So, what' s the fox urine for?
- That' s for foxes.
- What' s the rifle for?
- That' s for niggers.
Okay, let' s see.
Let' s give you those sandwiches now.
I think we' re about ready to get y' all out of here.
- That' s $56 even.
- Okay.
Anything I can do for you, friend?
No, I think that' s...
Thank you.
You all have a good vacation now.
- You too.
- Come back and see me.
Thanks a lot, man.
You have a nice day.
Did that guy just say, "nigger"?
Marcy:
Yeah, you don' t have to repeat it.
You can call it the "n" word.
Hey.
Boy, you want to give me one good reason why you would steal a Snickers bar.
The nougat?
Sorry, man.
My bad.
All right.
Enjoy.
Thanks.
What?
Moron.
What' s wrong with you, dude?
Sorry.
I should burn his fucking store down, the racist fuck!
All right, make a left.
Here?
- Marcy:
Where else am I gonna go?
Oh, and then down here...
Stop the car!
Stop, stop!
I left my Mott' s apple juice back at the store!
Oh my God.
- Come on!
No, we' re not going back.
- Come on!
I' m sure this river is in the map, right?
Yes!
There' s no way that this is on the map.
It is on the map.
Do you want to look?
This map' s for Cincinnati.
Shut up.
Fine, fuck it.
We' il go this way.
Oh my gosh.
Wow.
"Welcome, y' all.
Enjoy your vacation from all of us at Bunyan Mountain Getaways. "
Oh my God, Jeff, check it out.
It' s so cute - this little room, this little bed...
lts view is so beautiful.
The view of the shrubs... and the bush and the antlers.
It' s gonna be so perfect.
We' re here for a week, and there' s no one to bother us.
Who' s up for a dip?
We' re - they' re -
Yeah.
Safe sex.
- Eh, Paul?
- Yeah?
Have fun.
It' s kind of sweet, you know?
They seem pretty in love.
Bert, what the hell is that?
Huh?
I' m gonna go shoot some squirrels.
Why would you want to kill squirrels?
- 'Cause they' re gay.
- Don' t be a fucking retard.
Kidding.
I don' t care if they' re gay or straight.
- I' il kill them either way.
- Will you be careful with that?
Would you relax, man?
It' s a fucking BB gun.
Relax.
Sorry.
So, Karen... how long have we known each other?
Seventh grade, right?
Yeah.
I was thinking, we' ve known each other for so long, and even though we -
That' s hot!
And, even though we' ve always been good friends, we never actually -
I' ve always thought you were really cool.
Hey, race you to the raft.
Fuck!
Oh my God!
Oh, feels fucking great!
- You like that?
- Yeah!
Jeff:
Oh yeah!
So you know Ken Webb?
Yeah.
Short, greasy Ken.
The guy with the CDs, right?
Yeah.
He tried to kiss me.
- He did?
- Yeah.
Two days ago.
This guy I' ve known for 12 years, he' s a family friend.
He puts his hands on my face, full- on tongue!
It was so gross!
'cause he' s gross?
No, it was definitely him.
I don' t know.
When you' ve known someone a long time, you just want to kiss them just to see if they' re a good kisser.
There' s nothing wrong with that, right?
No.
- Where are you going?
- What' s it look like?
- I thought we were kissing.
- Yeah, we were.
Don' t be gay.
Come back, Mr. Woodchuck.
I' m gonna get you now.
Oh shit.
Oh fuck.
I' m sorry, man.
What?
- Why did you shoot me?
- I thought you were something else.
I didn' t - fuck!
- Are you all right?
- I' m s - sick.
- I need help.
- Oh man.
I' il get you some help, all right?
I' il be right back.
I got a car.
Oh fuck.
Oh please, help me.
- Fuck.
- I' m sick.
I need water.
Just lay down.
Don' t move, man.
- Water.
- I' il get you water.
Just stay - don' t come near me, okay?
Is that your -
- is that your cabin?
- No!
Just stay there!
Please, stay there.
Don' t make me fucking shoot you, man.
Just stay the fuck back, please!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck!
What the fuck, man?
Where were you?
You gonna burn the whole fucking place down?
What are you, Smoky the Clown now?
Don' t you mean, Smoky the Bear?
Whatever.
This is horseshit, man.
- It' s a fireplace.
- How old are you?
Can' t you be responsible for anything?
What were you shooting at?
I heard a squirrel.
I was just looking for a squirrel.
- A squirrel?
- Yeah.
- Jeff:
To stick up his ass.
Why don' t you tell us the story?
What are you gonna roast on that thing?
Come on, Paul, tell them story.
No, I can' t.
It' s a traumatic experience.
- I don' t want to talk about it.
- We like traumatic stories.
- Not about me, but...
- Trauma bonds people.
- You can tell us.
- It bonds those who go through it,
- not the people you tell it to.
- Tell the fucking story!
All right!
So there' s this bowling alley when we were growing up.
You guys might remember it - Lenny Meads Brighton Bowl?
It was in Brighton, right?
That' s probably why it was called Brighton Bowl.
We used to go there for birthday parties or with my dad for the weekend.
This one time, I asked my dad if we could go.
He' s like, "No.
The bowling alley' s closed. "
This marshmallow' s so burnt!
It turned out there had been a break- in.
All the employees were held at gunpoint.
After they had been gagged and beaten, they were tied to chairs.
The chairs... they were set in a circle, so that way everybody was forced to watch everybody else.
And then the robber, this sick maniac, he goes and finds one of those little ball- peen hammers.
And then one by one... he smashed the backs of their heads open with the hammer.
Everyone had to watch their friends die, knowing that they' d soon be next.
Ball- peen...
The guy doesn' t stop there.
He breaks out the fire axe.
The alarm goes off... he doesn' t give a shit.
He hacked off all of their limbs.
The cops found six bloody torsos tied to the bowling seats.
Blood everywhere...
Turns out the guy was some disgruntled employee.
That was my childhood playground.
Bert, you asshole, it' s not funny.
Yes it is, you fucking slut.
Jeff?
What?
Tell them about the happy bald guy.
- No, I can' t take it.
- He gave us our shoes and quarters for the video games.
There was a room with a pool table, but my dad wouldn' t let us go there.
The bald guy was always happy, always smiling.
But the killer got him too.
When the cops searched the place, they found hacked off limbs at the end of the bowling lanes.
The guy had bowled people' s organs.
Arms, legs, everything.
They found the bald guy' s head in the ball return.
- He was still smiling.
- Oh, no.
I knew you were full of shit!
You suck!
No!
It was in the paper.
I swear!
I' m laughing because
Jeff is an asshole and he' s making me laugh.
I loved this place.
I still remember the sounds... the cracking, the bouncing.
The smell of the shoes, the sound of the Q- Bert machine...
Holy shit!
What are you doing?!
- I' m cool.
- Are you spying on us?
- I' m cool.
- Is your dog friendly?
Yeah, he' s cool.
This is Dr. Mambo.
Here, boy.
Come on, Dr. Mambo.
Is it "Dr." like a physician or a professor?
Oof!
Faced!
Scratch- moded.
It' s a positive bonfire.
Got room for one more?
Actually, we were having a private conversation, if you don' t mind.
That' s cool.
I guess I' il smoke all this weed by myself.
No, no.
It' s fine.
It' s not that private.
Awesome.
Yeah, sit right here.
I think he' s gonna fuck her.
Awesome.
- Wait, so your name was...
- Justin...
- but you can call me "Grim."
- Grim.
Like Grimace?
"Grim" is my skating name.
I got it in Berkeley while competing in the X- Games.
Really?
Karen' s going to go to Berkeley.
Dude... awesome.
I love Berkeley.
People there are so wacked.
I met these guys and they had me fucked up for five days straight.
They wouldn' t let me drink anything but beer.
Yeah, I' ve done that, except I did it with JD.
Karen' s got a great idea.
We should only drink beer for the rest of the trip.
I could probably do that, but I doubt you could.
I' il bet you.
I can only drink beer the rest of the trip.
If I drink anything else, you can have the rest of my supply.
All right, you' re on.
We only drink beer.
You' re on.
So, you' re a skater?
Is that your occupation?
Oh, crap.
Party' s over.
Hey Justin...
Grim... you want to come inside?
I' d love to, but I left all this shit outside my tent.
It' s starting to rain, if it gets fucked up, it' s like $4, 000 worth of shit pissed away.
How far away is your tent?
20 minutes away, but if I book I can be back in 30.
- Cool.
Bring the weed.
- I will.
Check you dudes later.
Come on, Dr. Mambo.
Freak.
I thought he was funny.
How did it work?
What do you mean "how"?
It had a hose... a bunch of different settings, pulse, power... stream.
And you came every time?
Totally.
You can imagine my disappointment the first time I had sex.
Tell me about it.
What' s that supposed to mean?
- I' ve got a better story.
I' m sorry, but no story is better than Karen and the shower massage.
No, seriously.
One time I was masturbating... and my dog came up and started licking my balls.
Right as I came it stuck its tongue up my ass.
That' s serious fucking masturbation talent right there.
Fucking good.
He' d better have brought more weed or I won' t let him in.
Relax, pal.
I' m coming.
His name' s Grim.
Jesus Christ.
Help me... please.
I need a doctor.
Oh shit.
Doctor.
Yeah, all right.
Somebody grab a blanket or something.
You... you shot me.
No, no, no.
There' s no way this contagious fucker' s coming in here.
- He' s sick, for Christ' s sake.
- You want him to come in here and touch all of your shit, your fucking soap...?
Let' s throw him a blanket or something.
- Or your douche?
- Let' s drive him to a doctor.
He' s not coming in!
We' re out of range.
I' m not getting anything.
- Fuck!
- What' s that?
- He' s in the car.
What?
Motherfucker.
Why' s he fucking with us?
- Grab your gun.
Fuck!
Hurry up!
He' s in the car already!
Get out of the fucking car!
Get out of there.
Get out of the car!
Get out!
Get out of the fucking car!
Fuck!
Get the fuck out!
Get out of there!
- Fucker!
- You shot the car!
What was I supposed to do?
Oh my God!
Fuck!
Shit!
Shit!
Oh!
- Get him!
- He' s coming towards us.
Stop or I' il fucking stab you!
Stop!
Stop!
Back off.
Fuck off!
Leave us alone!
Fuck off!
I know.
I know.
What else were we gonna do?
First he gets his shit all over the car, and I don' t want him touching me, you, or anybody.
I think the rain will put him out.
He' s dead anyway.
You saw that shit on him.
He looked like he was skinned alive.
We have to tell the police it wasn' t our fault.
I think we should tell them now.
Calm down.
There' s nothing we can do.
The car' s fucked.
We need a mechanic.
We' il find somebody who knows one, and then we' il report the accident.
That' s the keyword here.
It was an accident.
The guy' s skin... holy shit.
You should clean up some of this shit while we' re gone.
I' il save some for you guys.
- Just stick with the girls.
- What' s that supposed to mean?
It means you' re a fucking pussy.
That' s fucked up.
What' s fucked up is you beating the shit out of my truck.
What about the jag- off with the rifle?
Did you forget about him?
We all fucked up that car, don' t just put it on me.
Good morning, boys.
Are you going to kill each other now?
Where are you going?
To get help.
So...
Bert and Jeff are gone.
I know.
Last night was a fucked up situation,
- and I think...
- That guy asked for our help.
We lit him on fire.
Can you understand if I' m not in a particularly social mood?
I got scared.
I was...
I was just trying to help.
Karen...
I' m sorry, Paul.
Every time I close my eyes I see him.
It was an accident.
The guy was going to die anyway.
Better?
Yeah.
Thanks, Paul.
Hello?
God damn it!
God damn it!
God damn it!
God damn it!
Hold it!
You there!
Do you see this?!
Do you see this shit?!
We didn' t see anything.
Tell Murray I can' t eat this shit.
Some animal' s been running around infecting everything.
What am I supposed to do with a sick hog?
Huh?
I am not about to eat that meat.
Would you?
- No, I' m a vegetarian.
- None of this shit is good.
It' s all sick.
It' s all gotta go back.
I want me a new hog!
We were just looking for a mechanic.
Mechanic?
You won' t find one around here.
- Bert:
That' s the thing.
Our car' s busted, so we can' t get into town.
We need somebody to take us into town
- so we can find a mechanic.
- Oh.
I' ve already been in town today, sorry.
All right, if you do go back, would you tell us?
We' re staying at a cabin, and... we don' t know Murray.
Oh, I' m sorry.
Yes, of course, of course.
Why didn' t you just come out and say that?
Come on inside, I' ve got a radio.
We' il call Ricky.
He' s got a tow truck.
- Call Ricky.
- Ricky.
Sorry to bother you, but this crazy guy came out of the woods and tried to trash our car.
Sounds terrible.
I have some juice.
So this person damaged your car?
It was just this crazy hermit.
Real dangerous.
- We chased him away with bats.
- It wasn' t Henry, was it?
Nah, shit, never.
Henry?
My cousin Henry.
He knows about that ordinance.
He wouldn' t do something like that.
You hit him with a bat?
No.
No, it wasn' t Henry.
Our friend Walter, he got drunk.
One thing led to another...
- That' s no good.
- Yeah.
I' ve got a great idea.
Why don' t we take a walk down ourselves?
- It' s really nice out.
- We' il just walk.
- I haven' t seen the scenery.
Ricky' s awfully handy.
- Thanks for your help.
- Are you sure?
A little fresh air sounds great.
We really appreciate your help.
Take care.
We burned Henry.
Fuck!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Is anyone home?
Hello?
- Ah!
- Bert, you dick- nose.
- Shut up.
What the hell?
- Did you find anybody?
- No, nothing.
I followed the path that the old guy ran, but I couldn' t find him.
He could still be alive.
No, it' s impossible.
- Want any beef jerky?
- No, put it away.
- Why?
- It' s not our house.
So?
- Did you find a phone?
- No.
I felt weird looking around.
There' s nobody here.
We found this other place, but... there was nobody there either.
I wonder if the cops know about it yet.
I doubt it.
If they did know, they' d have been at the cabin by now.
Good morning.
Bunyan County Sheriff' s Department.
Hi.
What can I do for you?
I' m on patrol in my jurisdiction and I heard there was a lot of commotion here last night.
I wanted to know what the story is.
Yeah, sure.
Some guy tried to break into our cabin.
And he was sick.
I don' t know what kind of disease he had, but he was a mess.
I have to report this.
Yeah, totally.
My friends are out looking for a neighbor so we could call you.
We don' t have a phone here.
That' s what I use.
Hey...
Looks like you guys were doing some pretty good partying, huh?
Yeah, you know, we were drinking... and then this guy came along and tried to break into the cabin.
We had no choice but to get rough.
I feel awful, but he was going crazy.
He smashed into our car, and then he wouldn' t come out, so... we had to hit him.
We hurt him.
We were terrified.
We didn' t know what to do.
That' s why we went to look for help -
I' m gonna make a report.
Don' t worry about it.
He ain' t gonna come back.
Looks like you guys scared him away pretty good.
I ain' t gonna let him ruin your fun.
Thank you.
My friend' s inside right now and she' s pretty freaked out.
She wants to go home.
We all kind of do.
A lady friend, huh?
I bet you like to party... with the ladies.
Paul?
Is everything okay?
Howdy, ma' am.
Everything' s fine.
Just go back inside, have yourself a big 40, just party.
Umm... okay.
Oh, Daddy, why are you talking about leaving?
You' ve got to stay and party.
That' s why we came here in the first place.
I' m telling you, this is a major party town.
- Really?
- Are you kidding me?
You know what it' s like when you go to a new town and you' re the new guy?
All the girls see you walking down the street... they don' t know you' ve got five pounds of dangling meat.
They' re looking for no commitment.
- You understand what I' m saying?
- I' ve heard that theory before.
This is that town.
It' s like when I go party up at Wambusau.
My cousin goes to school there.
When I party at Wambusau, I know I' m gonna get pussy.
Plus the girls there don' t know I' m a deputy.
So I know they' re gonna party hard with me.
Believe me, man, they do.
That' s too bad, I bet you ruled this town before you had a badge.
Yeah, but a badge makes you grow up quick.
Shit, this guy went and did a number on your ride.
I' m gonna put out an APB.
We' re gonna catch this guy.
Yeah, it wasn' t totally him.
We hit it too.
But we were trying to scare him away.
Could you get somebody up here to fix it?
An idiot?
I' il have someone up here by tomorrow afternoon.
You' re top priority.
You' re the party man.
Do you realize how many great parties we' re gonna have?
Fortune' s shining on you.
I know where all the big parties are at.
Remember, my name is Winston.
You know how to get a hold of me, right?
- 9- 1- 1?
- That' s it, my man.
- Take it easy.
- Yeah.
Did he say he was gonna report this shit or not?
I think he is.
He didn' t make it seem like we did anything wrong.
He said he' d get a tow truck up here.
- Sounds weird to me.
- The guy was weird.
Once he saw Karen, he didn' t want to leave.
Has Karen left her room yet?
No, she' s still sleeping.
I don' t know what' s up with her.
She wants to get out of here as soon as she can.
- Puts a kink in your plan, huh?
- What plan?
What plan?
The plan you' ve been trying to execute since eighth grade.
No, there' s no plan.
Not anymore.
Whatever.
You guys are funny.
Fucking... she likes you because you' re nice to her and she' s nice to you because she can control you.
- Fucking, you' re nice to her...
- Bert, don' t move.
Fuck.
- It' s that freak' s dog.
- Should I hit it?
- I don' t know.
If you' re gonna hit it, hit it hard.
So where' s Grim?
He' s out there rotting.
There' s some sick shit in the woods and the hermit' s spreading it around.
I' m not waiting for that deputy to come back.
- Let' s get out of here now.
- Should we say something on our way out, like, "By the way, we burned some guy alive"?
- Yes.
- No.
- Jeff.
- Fine, we' il tell the cops.
We have to.
They' re gonna figure it out.
The deputy knows something happened.
We' re the only outsiders.
They' re gonna trace it back to us.
I feel nauseous.
Karen...
How soon can you get us out of here?
I don' t know if I can fix the car.
I' m thinking I could make it drivable, we could drive into town and tell them what happened.
And that' il be that, right?
But you' re gonna have to watch me with the gun.
I' m not gonna go out there with that fucking dog around.
I need a bath.
Jeff' s mom has the stupidest ideas -
"Let' s get a cabin."
So gay.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry.
I didn' t mean to wake you.
That' s okay.
I think Marcy made some chili.
I' m not hungry.
All right, then.
I' il let you go back to sleep.
No, wait.
Stay.
- Fuck.
- Why did you stop?
- Would you shoot him already?
Don' t stop.
Keep working!
- Shoot it!
- If it gets closer, I can hit it.
Just keep working!
Oh my God!
Shit!
Marcy!
She' s got it!
She' s sick.
Oh no, she' s fucking got it.
- Oh shit.
- I think I' m really sick.
Oh shit.
Stay in your fucking bed!
- Bert, can you help me?
- Calm down.
No!
Get the fuck out!
Everybody out!
- Just get the fuck out!
- Bert, please!
- Stay in your fucking bed!
- I' m bleeding.
- Get the fuck out!
- Calm down!
- Can I go to the bathroom?
Listen, you bitch!
Get the fuck in bed!
- Leave her alone!
- Leave her alone!
- Fucking bitch!
- What the fuck is your problem?
- She' s your fucking friend!
She' s sick!
She' s not coming near me!
I' m doing this for you and all you fucks!
- Don' t leave me!
- Stop it!
- Bert, Bert... calm down.
- Oh God.
- Okay.
What?
Fuck you, guys.
Karen, I' m sorry.
We just don' t want to get it.
- I' m going to die in here.
No, you' re not.
Karen, please.
We' re going to get help now.
- What about that guy' s dog?
- Someone' il keep watch with the gun.
We' il bolt the door shut.
Somebody' il be out here.
We won' t leave you alone.
I want to go home.
Ah!
- Ah!
Karen?
Karen.
Come on, Karen, you' ve got to eat.
Let me know if you need anything else, okay?
Okay?
Better close the door, Marcy.
I don' t want to infect everyone.
- Oh God.
- What are you doing?
My friend... she' s very sick.
- You are very sick.
- Oh my God, I' m sorry.
- No, I' m - - That' s my wife in there!
My friend' s dying!
We need a phone, please.
- Get the fuck off my property!
- Shit!
- Git!
Where have you been?
Did you find anyone?
Well, come on inside.
Marcy made chili.
Nobody' s hungry?
- Jesus!
I washed them!
He' s right.
I' m not gonna eat until we get back to town.
I know we checked, but I' m not gonna sleep near you guys.
So go sleep in the car and give us all a break.
The car?
That thing' s a germ factory!
- I don' t even want to ride in it!
- Calm down.
I cleaned it.
- So why don' t you sleep in it?
- Maybe I will!
You' re right.
We should prepare our own meals.
Who am I?
I' m melting!
I' m burning!
What' s your problem?
You' re gonna burn down this place!
- What?
- You asshole!
- Fucking prick!
Stop it!
- Jeff!
- Motherfucker!
Shut the fuck up!
Christ!
I can' t take it anymore!
Just no more yelling.
We can eat alone, we can sleep alone.
Whatever.
We have to talk to each other.
We have to work together.
Bert, you just lost the bet.
Shit!
Okay, Karen, he' s gone.
We' re gonna stay out here all night for you, all right?
Karen?
Fuck!
Come on, let' s go, everybody.
Hurry up!
The Jeep' s running.
Jeff, come on!
Come on, Karen.
We' ve got to go.
I think I' ve got a fever.
Let' s go!
Come on, Jeff, let' s go!
Come on, motherfucker!
All right... put her in the back.
I don' t think we should sit next to her.
Fuck off!
Put her in the front, then.
No, I' m not driving with her sitting next to me.
I' m driving.
Just get in the fucking car.
Fine.
Karen?
Karen, you okay?
Oh God, Karen.
We' ve got to get her to town.
She' s gonna die.
She' s not going anywhere.
Come on.
You guys coming?
Are you nuts?
She just infected the car.
- I' il take my chances, man.
- I can' t leave Karen.
- Bert, you don' t look so hot.
- I don' t feel so hot either.
But the longer we sit here, the more she lies and rots!
How sick are you?
Did that old guy touch you?
This is fucking horseshit!
Come on!
- Did he?
- Fuck this, man!
I' il get her a fucking doctor.
We should move her back to the shed.
Oh God, she' s bleeding again.
Don' t move her.
It' s okay, Karen.
We' re gonna get help.
- Going somewhere?
- Anywhere but here.
Where the fuck do you think you' re going?
Jeff?
- Just let him go.
- Jeff!
Jeff!
Don' t fucking come near me.
Stop!
I don' t want to get sick.
I don' t want any of us getting sick!
But you two fuckers insist on touching her!
Now she' s bleeding all over both you guys.
So you two can fucking rot!
But not me!
No fucking way!
Not me!
Asshole!
Oh shit.
We' re all going to get it.
We' re all going to get sick... and Jeff' s in the woods getting drunk.
Bert' s going to get help.
Karen will be fine.
I promise.
It' s like being on a plane when you know it' s going to crash.
Everyone around you is screaming and yelling,
"We' re going down!
We' re going down! "
'cause you know you' re gonna be dead soon anyway.
- You don' t use condoms?
- Don' t worry.
I' m healthy.
Oh fuck!
Hello?
Somebody help!
Hello!
What the hell happened to you?
My friend, she' s sick.
- You don' t look so good.
- I know.
There' s this disease.
I think all my friends are getting it.
Do you know where a hospital is around?
Yeah.
Stay right there.
Don' t come any closer.
I' il get a doctor.
Thanks.
Pancakes!
- Pancakes!
- No pancakes.
- Pancakes!
- No pancakes!
Dennis, I told you to stay on the swing!
Dennis!
Fuck!
God damn it!
What pancakes!
Why did you come here?
Now look what you' ve done.
I just need a doctor, okay?
Look what you' ve done to this poor boy!
- What has he done to you?
- I just need... a fucking doctor, man!
I already lost one boy.
I ain' t losing another.
What if the doctors can' t fix my boy?
You get my boy sick, it' s the same as killing him.
- It' s murder!
- What?!
You being sick, that' s your problem.
Now Dennis is sick, that' s my problem!
And if I get sick, that' s Lucille' s problem.
So we got to stop the problem.
We got to stop the problem right now!
Fenster!
Rifle!
Fuck you, man!
There are some kids in a cabin.
They got a disease.
They just gave it to Dennis.
We' il need the kit.
Jesus, Paul, you did a number on my back.
I' m gonna go find Jeff and we' re walking out of here.
- What about Bert?
- I can' t wait for him.
- I have to get out of here.
- What about Karen?
Paul?
- Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Oh, fuck!
Shit.
Up here!
Help me!
- Bert!
- They' re coming for you.
- Who?
The deputy?
- No, the guy from the store.
I knew these kids were trouble the minute they stole from Cad.
Good God.
They' re doing sacrifices or something.
This ain' t Christian.
Good night, fucker!
Got him.
Jeff!
Jeff!
It' s the water!
Wherever you are, don' t drink the water!
Hello?
Jeff?
Jeff!
Jeff?
Fuck!
Here, have a big beer.
Come on, drink up.
You' ve got some sexy hair.
You got sexy shoes, too.
Shit, what the fuck happened to you, man?
The tow truck.
What happened to the tow truck, Winston?
Oh shit.
The fucking party man.
I' m so fucking sorry about the tow truck.
I sent it, it broke down.
I had to get a tow truck to get that fucking tow truck.
What do you need, you need a ride?
Yeah.
Yeah, a ride would be good.
Winston!
- Winston, do you copy?
- Yes, sir, I copy.
I' m still looking for that underage booze party.
We' ve got bigger problems.
Some kids up in a cabin are on a killing spree.
There' s two, possibly three casualties.
They are armed and hostile.
Do not go anywhere near them!
They' ve got some kind of skin virus that will eat you alive.
So if you do see them, do not hesitate to shoot them.
- Do you copy?
Can you repeat the last part?
I said, if you see the kids, just shoot them on sight!
So, how about that ride?
What the fuck?
Just shoot him!
- Hey, I can' t.
- You heard the walkie- talkie dude!
- The fucking gun is in the car.
- I just want to get into town.
- Why don' t you just relax?
- Get away, fucking fruitcake!
You' re not going anyplace!
- Fuck!
- Shit.
Come on, be cool.
Be cool.
Oh fuck!
You fucking idiot!
You just fucked up the whole party, you fucking idiot!
The party' s over, Winston.
Son.
We need you to start from the beginning.
Everybody' s dead.
We need to know... where you got this disease.
It was a guy from the woods.
Oh God, he looked like Bert' s marshmallow.
He told me he would get a tow truck.
I should have killed him too.
We' re not equipped to handle a situation like this.
Cook County is his only shot.
Fine.
You put him in the car... and I' il take care of him.
Hey, look who' s waking up!
The fucking party man!
I guess the party ain' t over, huh?
We have a long night of partying.
- A long night.
- Water.
- I ain' t got no water.
All I got' s a 40.
I' il find some for you, okay?
You just sit tight, I' il take care of you.
Holy shit.
They' re dead.
My God.
All dead.
I made it.
I made it.
Oh God, I made it.
I did it.
I fucking made it.
I fucking made it.
I did it.
I fucking made it!
I knew it!
I knew it!
I fucking made it!
I fucking made it!
I made it!
I fucking made it!
You got rid of that other one, right?
Hey, I think there' s another one in the basement.
Come on, boys!
Let' s do this!
Hey, fellas!
It' s been a rough morning up here.
Lemonade, mister?
Thanks, son.
Don' t mind if I do.
That' s five cents.
Businessmen.
You almost take after your granddad.
They' re running me out of my own business.
Stealing me blind right here.
Whoa!
Now, that is mighty fine.
Mighty fine.
Grab a cup, boys.
This round' s on me.
Here you go, all polished and everything.
Ain' t that a beauty?
Look at that, honey.
Looks like it' s brand new.
- Hi, my nigga, how are you?
- What' s up, nigga?
Where you been, man?
No!
No!
Mommy, Mommy!
Please, help me.
Mr. Dowd was pronounced dead on arrival, Detroit Sinai.
Perforated cranial pan, projectile fragmentation... frontal lobe.
Now, the woman, Jeanine Mueller, she subsequently lost the child.
Uterine damage, hemorrhaging on admittance.
The infant died due to blood loss suffered by the mother.
Hospital records indicate acute fetal trauma, gunshot wound.
This material was covered some months ago.
Why is it being brought up again?
Have you had contact with Ms. Mueller?
I have spoken to her, yes.
On what occasion did you speak with Ms. Mueller, and what prompted the conversation?
I' m not going to answer that.
Do you think, in retrospect, acting perhaps less aggressively, this might have been prevented?
What might have been prevented?
The infant' s death.
That' s very dangerous, you know that?
Hungry?
I' il bite it off.
He' s going to wake up.
If the smell didn' t wake him up already, he' s out.
My feet smell?
Yeah.
So.
So, how' d it go?
It went.
Yeah?
What can I say?
What did you say?
What do you think?
Ma' am, let me just, uh...
Sorry, your name, again?
Liz Detmer.
My, uh, duty assignment was solely undercover narcotic work.
Do you have any idea what that entails?
I have a general idea, yes.
Okay.
Well, then, generally speaking, Ms. Detmer, you don' t know what the fuck you' re talking about.
They expect you to come in with this, "glad to be here" bullshit, head hung low, hat in hand.
Yeah, that' s ridiculous.
Well, they' re not going to forget.
It' s all what they say.
Then I don' t understand why, you know, you went and talked to them.
'Cause they asked.
Mr. Tellis, that' s not necessary.
If you haven' t seen what I' ve seen, or done what I' ve done, you don' t know where I' m coming from.
I am not an officer of the law, Mr. Tellis, and, therefore, I have no formal training.
But I would expect someone that did would perhaps behave judiciously, exercising discretion and restraint in necessary quantities...
Look, we can do this all goddamn day.
You want to assess all this blame?
I' m going to call you on it.
So what is this?
I mean, I can make it very simple for you.
I' il talk.
I have no problem with that.
But if this becomes some half- ass ambush, and you' re putting me under the lamp,
Now.
Are you familiar with the Michael Calvess case?
Yes.
He was murdered.
Yes, I' m aware of that.
This investigation, as you may or may not know, has stretched over 60 days, and failed to produce any tangible evidence or yield a single suspect.
It has not, however, deterred or diminished our efforts to apprehend and punish those responsible.
Throughout your undercover stint, you maintained prolonged contact with the city' s drug element.
Would that be an accurate statement?
I had some relationships.
Is it fair to say, given your rather abrupt discharge from the ranks 18 months ago, that your cover and those contacts might remain intact?
We feel that your presence in this investigation would be invaluable, and would warrant complete reinstatement, homicide division, detective grade.
When the suspects are caught and charged, and a verdict rendered, you would be eligible for the assignment of your choosing, commensurate to sentencing.
No.
I' m sorry?
I' m not interested.
Bear in mind, Mr. Tellis, if I may be so bold, that career opportunities in law enforcement...
What a fucking waste of time that was.
Tellis!
Captain Mitchell Cheevers.
- Thanks for coming down, man.
- Oh, sure.
Come on, listen, I want to apologize for in there, okay?
They get paid to put people on the spot.
They made their money today.
All right, come on, hey, hold on.
You' re going to make me fucking chase you?
Come on, give me ten seconds.
Go ahead.
- Yeah.
Okay, he didn' t deserve this.
Nobody does.
Fine, good, then help me out.
Come on, help me catch these motherfuckers.
Just- just look at the files, would you?
Help me out.
Time' s up.
For who?
What the fuck else are you going to do?
They offering you something?
They asked me to look at some files.
Shit.
I swear to God.
Yeah, files.
Why?
'Cause they got a dead cop and dead ends and they' re reaching.
This welfare- pension bullshit is not going to cut it.
I know that.
You just do something else, then.
What?
I do something else?
- Okay.
What would that be?
Yeah.
Lieutenant Oak, per departmental mandate is restricted from participating in the Calvess investigation any further.
That' s the log line, and... that' s the way it' s been worded to me.
Why is that?
Well... he and Calvess were close.
He' d been on collateral narcotic investigations for over a year.
He discovered the body.
I like him.
He' s got a 93% conviction rate.
He' s swingin 'a big stick.
He makes solid collars that make solid cases.
But... between you and me, he' s not stable.
He' s all of that shit a cop just cannot be, not right now.
Not in this city.
We' re talking about a marked name.
I swear to fucking God, if I get another call you' re beating on your wife and kids, you' re fucking dead!
Get the fuck off me!
- Get off!
What the fuck!
I mean, listen, Captain, we can both sit here and say, or we can assume that he' s just adhering to this department ban on his involvement.
You' re a smart guy.
You know that' s bullshit.
Well, I would hope so.
Yes, but again... it' s only a matter of time before IAD brings down an indictment on him.
Listen, do yourself a favor, concerning Oak, um...
I would just blow out all this bullshit, go to Convicts and Ethics Inquiries, and hinge this whole thing on his involvement.
Would that be up to and including your own involvement?
I don' t understand.
Nick, if I go to bat for him,
I' m going to have to do it contingent on you being his partner for the duration.
The duration of what?
The duration of the investigation.
Hey, you asked me to read some files, and I did.
You know, the tale of the tape is... and this is nothing you don' t already know... is that your best shot at breaking this is bringing him back on, and just go off the work he' s already done.
I don' t want to waste any more time.
I am not looking for active assignment.
I don' t...
I mean, this three- quarters is not cutting the shit.
I don' t want to be out with some guy playing nine- ball on some perp' s skull.
I' il tell you that.
I want a desk.
I need a desk.
Fine.
Get me a conviction, I' il get you a desk.
Like that?
Just like that.
Why don' t we get some coffee?
You must be somebody' s something special.
No, not really.
No, not really?
Getting them to reassign me to a case that I' d been so resoundedly removed from?
It' s not what I did.
It' s what you did.
The work you put in.
They know they' re better off with you than without you.
I' m just going to say this, all right?
I don' t know you, so I refuse to fuck around with you any more than I have to.
Did Internal Affairs set you up with this?
No.
No?
Fringe ex- cop fallen out of favor,
They got files three feet thick on guys like you.
They bunted you on a reflex.
Probably, but I' m telling you the truth.
You weren' t approached or asked in any way to keep tabs on me for IA?
No, I was not.
Hey, I don' t blame you for asking.
Now what does that tell you?
That tells me that this investigation is running on fucking fumes.
Don' t get confused thinking that this is about Calvess.
I know it' s not.
This is all politics.
This is political appointments, it' s referendums, it' s squashing a race riot.
You think those assholes upstairs give a shit and a shake about Michael Calvess?
They didn' t know him, they don' t care about him, and they can' t forget about him fast enough.
The only thing you need to know about me is that I' m going to bag the motherfuckers that killed Mike.
If that means breaking every point of procedure, then they' re broke.
It' s because his life was worth a little bit more than a wreath and a rifle salute.
You understand?
No, it' s just me.
And what about you?
What about me?
Well, why you coming back to this shit?
Cops die daily, and they die bad.
What makes Mike the exception?
I don' t know.
You don' t know?
Just something to do?
Something.
I know what time it is, but you can still give me a kiss.
Audrey, I don' t want to get into this with you right now.
I just want to go to sleep.
I just want to lay down next to you, and go right to sleep.
I just want to...
I' m fucking beat, man.
His name was Jimmy Fredricks... was his street name.
He' d be dirtier, he was undercover.
No, no, no.
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you jumping up and down for?
- Cold, man.
Eh!
What are you, his interpreter?
Speak English, will you?
Speak English.
Stop jumping up and fucking down.
You ever seen this guy before?
He' s a cop... street name' s Jimmy Fredricks.
A guy named Jimmy Fredricks.
That' s his name...
Jimmy Fredricks.
He' d sometimes go by Calvess.
No.
- Nothing?
- Nothing.
Everything beautiful, yeah.
Let me ask you a little bit of a... there was a cat named Jimmy Fredricks, used to hang around here.
Jimmy Fredricks?
I don' t know that guy.
I want to ask you a question about a guy.
A cat named Jimmy Fredricks.
Does he live around here?
No.
You sure?
- Haven' t seen him.
I ain' t got shit to say to you.
Oh!
Jimmy Fredricks!
Nah, man.
Are you sure?
Because you look fuckin 'spun to me.
Is it relative to the case?
A guy named Calvess, yeah.
This guy' s pretending to be a cop, man!
That' s her screaming.
So he mentions this Jimmy Fredricks, and Cheevers told us to route this through you.
And what' s he saying?
Guy claims he' s the snitch for him.
Says he' il trade what he has to say for some type of sentence reduction.
Oh, we can' t do that.
We' re not going to do that.
Well, we got him cuffed up there, but he' s got no pants on.
I tried to get a pair on him, but... this guy' s fucking berserk.
All right.
What' s her name?
What?
Louisa Nuòez.
It' s all we could get out of her.
They married?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, don' t kick.
Look what he fuckin 'did to me!
Shut up!
Shut that dumb fucking bitch up!
Let go of me!
Let the fuck go!
Right there to the left.
Have fun.
Seòor ltchy Cock.
What you saying, man, what that?
Looks like you got yourself a bad situation, here, uh... what' s your name?
That' s it?
Going firebug on your old lady' s wig?
What' s all this fucking drug stuff?
Yo, man, did you see what she did to my fucking jimmy?
What that puta bitch did to my shit?
She out there tossing her nasty snatch on the curb.
She come back here poison pussy.
Now, I can' t hardly even walk around.
I can' t have no fabrics on, nothing.
Look at it, check it out.
All right, okay, Hoss, let' s just holster that up, okay?
I ain' t never seen no shit like that, black and blue.
I can' t wear no drawers.
This shit hurts so bad, I go take a piss... piss don' t even want to come out.
Yeah, uh...
Great.
You want to talk to us about a Michael Calvess?
Who?
Michael Calvess.
You used to snitch for a Michael Calvess.
His street name was Jimmy Fredricks.
What can you tell us?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, him.
He dead, right?
That' s right, he was killed.
Yeah, I seen it on TV, too.
Yo, could I get a quick hit?
What' d you say?
My cock is killing me, man.
Let me get a quick hit.
A quick hit.
I' il talk to you.
What?
I' il talk to you.
It' s almost impossible you' re this dumb.
You' re serious.
Yeah, just a quick one.
Please, bro.
Fucking junkies.
Who got a lighter?
I used my last match on that bitch.
I know my ass is going to jail.
I ain' t got no paper to post bail on.
I' m fucked.
What it gonna matter I hit this real quick?
It ain' t gonna half time or no shit like that, right?
I hit this, and I' il talk to you guys.
Come on, yo, my nerves.
They' re all, like, jingle- jangly.
Oh, fuck!
You going to tell us everything?
You sure?
Oh, yeah.
Don' t fuck with us.
This shit is fucking heaven, dawg.
All right, enough.
We took care of you, now talk to us about Calvess and knock that shit off, or else I' m going to turn a hose on you.
No, it hurts, man.
Stop picking at it, then!
Go!
Talk to me!
I seen him over on Bell Isle a few months back.
He beefing with my boy, Leo Lee.
You know Leo Lee?
Yeah, you know him and shit?
Leonard Leflore.
We used to run raids on his ass every other day.
So what were they arguing about?
Some shit, man.
Lee pinched on a buy.
That dude, Calvess, he got a bad temper, yo.
Listen to me, nobody gives a shit what you think you saw.
Just tell us what happened.
Yo, I' m telling you, man, I saw him spit on him.
I saw him walk away, told him, "nigga" this, "nigga" that.
Who- who, Calvess?
Yeah, man.
Don' t be fucking with me.
I' m not fucking with you.
This shit ain' t talking too loud, is it?
Yo, I swear that I saw it, man.
They, like, scrapping and shit.
They, like, argue, okay?
Let go of me!
So... you gonna use that, man?
That' s right, bitch.
Look at my fucking hair!
I' il burn you up with that shit!
Fuck you!
Crotch rot, pussy stank!
Fuck you!
Puta sucia de la vagallado!
I- I- I love you, baby!
Fuck!
I love you!
Fuck you!
That' s a good woman.
What do you know about this Leflore,
There' s no mention of him in any of Mike' s duty summaries.
There' s no F. I. card on him.
He' s just a nickle- bagger I ran across maybe half a dozen times.
He' s got two whole hobbies... ganja and guns.
Other than that, he' s a fucking bore.
But I guarantee he' s got outstanding warrants.
You want to run him?
Lay down on the floor, this is the police!
Oh, yeah.
I couldn' t get to Gabe' s birthday party.
It' s just...
I just had a lot of stuff to do.
Don' t worry about it, we didn' t miss you.
Thanks for the present, anyway.
Nick Tellis, this is a really good friend of mine, Art Harlan.
He works with the Coroner' s Office.
So I hear your name on the call, and this one I have to see.
No, this might have to do with Mike.
- Calvess?
- Yeah.
What the hell you doing with that?
I thought they were closing it out?
Okay, thanks, guys.
It' s good.
Rub- a- dub- dub.
Wow.
How long you think?
I' m guessing he' s sitting in this... two, three weeks.
That long?
Oh, yeah.
Okay, subject has distended bloat, upper, lower torso.
Clotting and... hematoma discoloration.
Hello.
What is it?
A tooth.
Back molar.
Blasted it right out of his head.
Well, most of his mandible was shattered, along with the rest of the dental palette, so IDing him outright' s going to be a little tricky.
Sorry.
What do you got there?
Looks like a Mossberg, SG 6- shot.
I don' t know how the fuck he got this.
Why?
It' s tactical issue, Metro PD.
SWAT team uses it.
It looks like the serial number' s been filed down.
Let me see that.
Definitely looks like our man opted out with it.
No question about that.
Oh, damn!
I don' t know about that.
Well, not on purpose.
What do you mean?
There' s no firing pin mark on the casing.
Boy never even pulled the trigger.
So what do you think happened?
I' m stretching here, but... knowing old Leo,
I think maybe he was high out of his fucking mind, reaches for the bong, goes down, breaks...
His lazy ass is not getting out of this warm water, so... he sees the gauge, maybe, and takes a little green bud, decides to pop it in the breach, fires it up, starts toking away, forgets there' s a shell in the pipe, flame hits the firing cap.
That' s beautiful.
Bubble bath, earful of tunes, smoking some hub, and this is how the evening ends!
Art.
That' s fucking fantastic.
That still doesn' t explain the Mossberg.
I don' t know how he got that.
Well... if it is tact ordinance, it could be an underground buy.
I mean, their armory' s been broken into a few times.
Yeah, it could be.
Or he could' ve known a cop.
Or somebody who knew a cop.
What do you want to do about this?
Nothing.
Recovery sweep through, if they find something good, if they get a stolen weapons hit, great.
What we came here to do is corroborate Ruiz 'story, which we obviously can' t do.
I think it was all bullshit anyway.
Hey, Art, I' il talk to you later.
Okeydoke.
I hear bubbles.
What are you guys doing up?
We had a deal, I thought, you and me, there?
I- I don' t know.
What are we going to talk about?
Oh, my God, what could we have to talk about?
I can' t believe that you' re out there again.
And don' t say that you' re not or give me any of that crap.
What are you talking about?
I' m sorry.
There are.
What do you want me to tell you?
Why don' t you tell me who uttered that fucking famous, uh,
Do you remember saying that?
Yeah, it' s narcotics, Audrey...
How bad you think that it was, huh?
Tell me what you remember,
Five months pregnant, being in a detox tank with you.
What the fuck is this coming from?
Not sleeping and watching you...
Do you remember that?
I' m a little late for bath time?
Well, excuse me.
I' ve been giving him one every day for seven months!
like you can just jump in and then just jump out again.
It is a big thing, all right.
It' s a fucking big thing!
Yeah, it' s two weeks work, is what it is.
You know what, that' s bullshit.
That is bullshit!
That' s all you want me to think that it is.
You know, the other day I asked you why you wanted to do this, and you said that you didn' t know.
Well, you know what?
'cause for the life of me,
I' m looking at you hold your son and I can' t understand, do you understand?
I can' t understand why you would ever feel the need to go back to that again.
Yeah, what if it was me who got wasted out there, Audrey?
That wasn' t you.
What if it was?
That wasn' t...
What if it was!
There are other people aside from you, okay?
You' re a little three- foot circle.
You know what, that' s really unfair.
They had this kid beaten half- dead.
They could' ve walked away.
Anyone could' ve.
Instead... they took the gun, and they blew half his head off, okay?
I know, I' m sorry, I' m sorry, baby.
I' m sorry, I' m sorry, I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
You were right about the Mossberg.
Definitely was one of ours.
Lab pulled partial prints off of it.
One set belonged to Leflore, the other set belonged to this gang- banger, Latroy Steeds.
It' s just that he' s got a bunch of drug shit.
Just did 30 days in Wayne County.
Got out a week ago.
Do we know where he' s at?
S- T- E- E- D- S.
Larry, you' re his parole officer.
All right.
Well, let me know if he shows, okay?
No problem, you got it.
He hasn' t checked in once.
Here, go on.
Come on, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Let' s move it out here!
How long you been married, Nick?
Uh... about a year and a half.
Got any kids?
Yeah, one.
I got a boy... a big baby boy.
Almost ten months.
That' s nice.
How long you been with your wife?
Um...
We were married just shy of 16 years.
She had cancer.
- No...
- I thought...
It' s okay.
I had one.
I' ve been asked before.
... because we' d avoid these embarrassing little moments, but it' s okay.
I like talking about her.
The first detail I had was... was vice.
I caught vice.
- Mm- hmm.
Just hated it.
You know, I rode it to the seams, hoping to leapfrog out of there, but... no good.
No dice.
And I' d come home, just in bad shape.
Just pissed off.
That' s when I first started getting an ulcer.
Just miserable.
And I' d lie down in her lap... and she' d rub my head.
Some nights, she' d sing me to sleep.
I' d just lie there, staring at her.
Still the best place I' ve ever been.
I' il tell you this much:
I became a much better cop the day she died.
I had about the job was gone.
I see a dead- bolted door, I break it down and be the first one in the room.
I started working Joint Task Force.
The head- crack, hang- wrecking crew.
Zombie squad.
It was a diversion.
It was just a way to keep from thinking about her.
I remember one night...... I went with the sheriffs on a warrant raid.
This dipshit was selling meth out of his apartment.
It was just a stop and pop.
Broke down the door, rousted the guy.
I was in one of the back rooms looking for junk.
And I hear something.
I turn around, and see these... these eyes staring at me from a closet.
It was a little girl.
A little ten- year- old girl... naked.
She was scared to death.
Her stepfather was pimping her out for rent.
Wrapped her in my coat... carried her out to the squad car.
And I beat that motherfucker half to death.
I thought of my wife.
I thought of the baby we never had.
All the things about her that I hung onto.
'Cause a little girl being brutalized, a little girl being abused has got nothing to do with the rules and regulations, and everything to do with right and wrong.
It' s the same thing with Calvess.
Why is he the cookie monster?
He loves cookies.
'Cause, like, every time in the morning
I want cookies for dessert... gone, no cookies left.
- No?
- None.
'Cause he eats them all.
He eats cookies for dinner.
This one won' t let me out of her sight.
She drags her dad' s T- shirt around with her wherever she goes.
Can you say hi to the man?
Shy.
She' s a little doll, though.
I want to thank you, Kathryn, for letting me come by.
Oh, it was not a problem.
Thank you for bringing his things.
I wasn' t too thrilled about going through them, but I' m glad you brought them.
I haven' t seen some of these pictures for a long time.
You have to forgive me, because I' m pretty convinced that any way I go about this is the wrong way, so...
No, please.
I don' t mind answering questions.
Did you know Mike?
No, I didn' t.
I never got the chance to meet him.
I wish I had.
I know his reputation, though.
But what I need to... know more of, I- I think...
Well, I worked undercover narcotics for two and a half years myself, so I know that life can be very difficult.
I know that it can be... very problematic, especially with a... with a family.
You know, maybe I...
Maybe not.
Baby, can you go check on your sister for Mommy?
Go check on your sister.
What are you asking me now?
Well, um...
Here at home?
No.
Did he tell you what it was that he was doing?
Yes.
Did that seem to bother him?
Did it bother you?
Yes, it did.
Well, there you have it.
You notice anything about his mood in the weeks before?
Was there anything strange about his behavior?
No.
Maybe there were some people that he was dealing with that... came out?
No.
I remember the day that Mike was killed.
I was putting the girls to bed, and I heard a knock.
And when I opened the door...
Henry was standing there with tears in his eyes.
And I knew right away that he was gone.
And I remember running back to the girls' room, and sitting on the edge of their bed and just...... staring at them.
I needed to see his face.
Come here, you.
How are you?
Give me a kiss.
Where' s my kiss?
There' s someone here.
He' s been asking me questions about Mike.
What?
I need to talk to you outside right now.
I' il be right back, okay?
What the fuck you doing talking to her without me being here?!
Yeah, and you questioned her.
What for?
What for?!
Is this "Mother, May I?"
We said we were going to do some of this on our own, right?
Take your hand out of my face.
If you need to know what she said about anything case- related, you refer to the file!
Yeah, I looked at the files.
They' re thin.
What you don' t fucking do is talk to her without notifying me in advance!
Why is that?
What' s the problem with me speaking to her?
Because the problem is every fucking question you asked her, she' s already answered!
You understand?!
- I understand that.
Don' t let it happen again.
It' s burnback.
It' s like a table scrap junk that they stew in a freebase and then shoot.
It killed this guy Dandridge I told you about.
Yeah?
Mason in Records.
Hey, what' s going on?
Hey, I got the stuff.
Looked for matches, looked for hits...
No, no, I just want hits.
Okay, I got four, and they' re a little bit vague.
You got something to write with?
Yep, go.
R. Evans...
Yeah?
Mosley.
G. Parks, E. Sheps.
Yeah?
He got brought in ten months late, and they booked him in the E. R.
All that stuff I faxed you...
You got an address on that?
Yeah, Madison...
For the last guy, I got 443 Grashid, Unit 2.
I don' t know how good it is, but that' s the last address we got.
"Unit 2," that' s good enough.
- All right, man, thanks.
- All right, appreciate it.
They ran the comps through, and about ten months ago, an overdose was brought into the E. R., and this guy Sheps...
Wait a fucking minute.
Jesus Chri...
I know fucking Eugene Sheps.
I know this fucking guy.
You know, you left the door unlocked.
What the fuck?!
You shouldn' t do that, 'cause anyone can walk in.
Ah, no need to get up.
Fuck, man!
My fucking arm!
There you go.
You' re a spicy little burrito, aren' t you, there, Eugene?
How are you, my man?
Take a seat.
Take a fucking seat.
Oh, fuck this, man!
Are you still sniffing glue, Deacon?
You still sniffing glue?
Isn' t this shit a little dated, dawg?
Fucked with a bottle of modeling glue a few years back, and you sealed your sinuses shut.
You had to have them drilled, you remember that back then, back in the day?
How you making your paper these days, Eugene?
Six months on, huh?
Titan Auto, Titan Auto.
You still stealing cars and cutting them up, or what, boss?
Oh, fuck, now I know your snitch and bitch ass now, man.
Wrong answer.
I seen you, man.
You that motherfucker hanging around Endo Joe and shit.
That' s right, that' s right.
You know what happened to him, right?
He up in Jackson, man.
No, no, no, no, he was.
- He' s dead now.
So they peeled him back and they shanked his bitch ass 56 times.
We got a lot of pals like that, don' t we, huh?
You know him?
No?
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah, man.
No?
You see, I do.
I know Dowd, I know Endo Joe,
I know what happened to that little punk you used to roll with,
I know your daddy nicknamed you Deacon after Deacon Jones,
You know how I know that, don' t you?
- How, man?
- 'Cause I was and I still am a cop.
A fucking cop?
You' re trying to tell me you a fucking cop?
- Lf you a cop, why you ain' t bust me back then?
'Cause you way too little to bust, acorn.
Yo, fuck that shit, man.
I used to smoke blunts with you, Mr. Cop, man.
I don' t give a shit what you think, asshole.
It doesn' t matter to me in the least, but I' m about to tell you what does matter, and you' re about to fucking listen
Fuck.
A month ago, an undercover officer was murdered... pedestrian tunnel off Houston and West Grand.
They beat him up, they put a gun to his fucking head, and put a bullet through it.
I don' t want to hear any shit about what you don' t know or what you didn' t do, because we both know you ain' t got the nut sack for something that size, so, I' m fucking positive you didn' t kill him.
His name was Michael Calvess.
Take a gander, there, buddy.
Hold on a minute, man.
Y' all motherfuckers come up in my fucking crib, and shit, want to throw fucking hot sauce and blind my fucking ass, and now you want me to help you?
- Fucking crazy?
- You know you know.
I know this motherfucker.
I think I might' ve let him suck on my dick once or twice.
Come here, come here.
You want to be bounced back to County, keep it up!
Piece of shit!
Oh, fuck, man, I think I' m bleeding, man.
You going to act like a punk, you' re going to get played like one.
Now, listen very, very carefully.
They found smack at the murder scene.
A mean fucking mix.
Now, you took some of this exact same stuff about ten months ago, and it nearly killed your dumb ass.
You don' t have the chemistry or the sense God gave goats, which means you didn' t do the cook.
Now, Dowd is dead, so, who sold to you?
Whatever, man.
You going to tell us?
You think you' re a real fucking smartass, you know that?
Every inch!
I didn' t do it, man.
I don' t know, man.
Where is it?
Oh, my God, this must be one of those new refrigerator safes!
What a laugh, you dumb fuck!
What' s all this, huh?
What' s all this?!
What do you know?
Deep lock found, deep lock found.
Unbelievably so fucking dumb!
Are you kidding me?
- Get off me, man!
It was fucking Darnell, man!
He' s got a cop ID.
He' s got a shield.
You all right?
Let me see.
Where you hit, the neck?
Let me call it in.
I' il call the paramedics.
I' il be right back.
We have a... we have a son so... but I' m- I' m going to be back.
I don' t know if you' re not listening or you don' t want to listen, but he didn' t do it!
Well, we' ve compiled enough evidence to support the contrary.
And what does that mean?
What?
That means we' re closing it out.
Captain... there' s absolutely no way that Sheps killed Calvess.
And if you' re closing because of that, you' re way off.
Neither one of us believe that he did it.
He didn' t have the capabilities!
He didn' t have the cold blood!
This guy did not do it.
And yet he had no compunction when faced with possible arrest about trying to kill both of you.
This is someone of questionable mental stability with a pronounced history of drug use.
That could ride the rap after the fact,
'cause this is what you' re going to do in lieu of.
You know, you all are jazzed up because this piece of shit that we killed, Sheps, was white.
So the whole racial card gets cooled, and you can forget about the dead cop.
That' s what this is all fuckin 'about.
Henry, ease off, all right?
We initiated and backed this effort from the very beginning, but factually irrefutable is the following:
We have a known criminal with over 40 felony and misdemeanor offenses with a drug tie linking him directly to Calvess in possession of stolen weapons, narcotics and identification belonging to another slain officer.
Richard Dekolvie was stabbed to death three years ago...
And Homicide got a confession and a conviction out of that, so that bullshit' s irrelevant.
What you fuckin 'bringing that into it for?
It still denotes illicit criminal acts.
Sheps came into possession of the ID as either a result of participation in the murder or through association with the murderers.
This guy was 105 pounds soaking wet.
These injuries that Calvess sustained, they only could have come from two men with considerably more size and strength.
That' s not even taking into account,
Jesus Christ, there' s no murder weapon.
What are you fuckin 'talking about here?
This matter is no longer mine, gentlemen.
I apologize.
Are you serious?
It' s the Commissioner of Police.
That is so fucked up.
Yes, it is fucked up.
This is so fucked up.
We' re done.
You' re so wrong, pal.
Fuckin 'bullshit!
I' m sorry, man.
I want you to stop now.
This is done.
It' s not.
No, it has to be.
You know I wasn' t happy and that was fine, but this is where I hit the wall
'cause I' ve seen you like this before.
And before I was willing to put myself through it, but I can' t do it anymore.
I' m gonna get 'em
I' m gonna get the guys who did it.
I, I lost 'em.
I lost 'em.
You know, you' re running at this for all the wrong reasons.
What, you think catching them is going to make you less like them?
Just like Calvess?
You know what, that' s bullshit, Nick,
'cause that' s not what he was.
That' s not what you are.
I love you, but I don' t want...
With everything that I am, I' m still going to leave.
'Cause I can' t be with you like this.
I' m done trying.
I' m done trying.
Look at this.
Where' d you get a warrant?
I ran that name that Deacon gave us...
Darnell.
Possession, trafficking.
His last arrest was pulling a gun on an officer.
Look who he was booked with.
Steeds.
Steeds and Berry were never questioned about Mike' s murder.
They all used to work at Titan' s Auto.
It was closed down after a flood six months ago.
I want to check this place out.
Hey.
Freeze!
Do not fuckin 'move!
Do not move!
Get down!
Now, fuckin 'Coolio tried to blow my head off.
Darnell, let me see you.
Come on!
We' ve got some shit to fuckin 'talk about.
I don' t see no warrants!
Let him go, man.
I' m Detective Lieutenant Henry Oak of the Detroit Metropolitan Police Department.
This is Detective Sergeant Tellis.
We already know who you are which is why we are here.
You' ve been hiding from us' cause you killed a cop.
That cop' s name was Michael Calvess...
Jimmy Fredricks.
Now I' m going to give you the opportunity to come all the way clean on this and confess.
Fuck that!
You know what you' re doin 'is illegal.
Just book us, man.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Shh- shh- shh- shh- shh.
You' re going to need a hell of a lot more than a fuckin 'phone call, my man.
You have multiple counts, you got assault, B& E, felony possession, grand theft fucking auto.
You add to that list the murder of a decorated cop, and you' ve officially fucked yourself for life.
Man, I didn' t murder no fuckin 'cop.
Shh.
Now I' m gonna toss this place.
Is there anything you want to tell me?
Huh?
Fine.
This is next.
Whose ride is this?
Is this yours?
Huh, Big D?
Is this your fucking car?
Is this yours?
Give me the keys.
Fuck you.
I ain' t giving you no keys.
Say it again.
Say "fuck you" again.
Say "fuck you" again to me.
Okay.
What is this, man?
Take us in.
You' re going to fuck around with me?
- Huh?
No!
Lieutenant!
Well, look at that.
What, are brothers throwing a coup?
You selling this shit to the Serbs?
Police issue.
That' s from the impound.
Let' s hear it.
What you been doing?
Huh, homes?
You been sneaking into the impound at night.
You' re in a lot of fucking trouble, boys.
This is it.
This is Calvess' gun.
This is Mike' s gun.
Huh?
Answer me.
What are you doing with a dead cop' s gun?
- Answer me!
I don' t know nothing about no fucking dead cop' s gun.
This is a police issue revolver, and it belongs to a slain officer.
What are you doing with it?
What?
That fucking gun wasn' t in there.
What are you doing with it?
Come on, that' s fucking bullshit.
It' s a throwaway.
It' s a what?
What' d you say?
- You planted that.
Is that what you said?
I planted it?
Look at the blood on the barrel.
Look at the dry blood on the trigger guard.
Look at it!
Who the fuck planted that, huh?
Who planted that?
- Come on, man.
- Who planted that?
Listen to me.
You two better get a fucking goddamn groove going right here
I want to talk to my lawyer!
What did you say?
I want to talk to my lawyer.
Come on, man.
You know you planted that shit there.
Please say one more fucking thing.
Please.
No, I didn' t do it.
In the trunk!
What' d I tell you?
They get dumber every year.
Okay?
We' il get this over real quick.
And you' re going to tell me, loud and clear, what happened.
Two months ago, a walking tunnel off of West Grand...
You found out there was an undercover cop in the group.
You confronted him, you overpowered him, and you beat him.
You took his pistol off of him.
You took it, you pointed it in his skull, you pulled the trigger and you killed him.
He died instantly.
That' s a fucking lie.
Remember Jimmy Fredricks?
Remember Jimmy Fredricks?
Look at him.
Look at him.
Remember him?
You fucking remember him?
He was a fucking junkie, man.
He was a fucking what?
Junkie.
You' re bullshit, Darnell.
Come on, man.
We sold that motherfucker every day.
Three or more times a day.
That' s fucking bullshit!
You' re fucking lying!
You' re lying!
You found out he was undercover!
He didn' t use, so you shot him!
You fucking dealing motherfucking...!
Fuck you!
Where you think we got them fucking cop guns from?
You lying...!
He was a cop!
That was a cop you killed!
He had a fucking wife!
He had kids!
Stop!
No, not like this!
No, stop, stop!
Listen!
You put them under duress this bust gets bounced at arraignment.
These two call it as a plant, and they fucking walk.
They fucking walk for good.
Okay?
Come on, we' re too close.
We get it, we roll prints off the pistol, all right?
You grab it.
I' m going to get on the horn and call a wagon.
No.
No, no, no.
We' re going to get the confessions on tape.
Then we call it in.
I want some time alone with these two.
Okay?
All right.
Yeah, okay.
But grab the kit, all right?
Look, we got conclusive guilt, we got the murder weapon.
I' il go upstairs,
I' il bag whatever peripheral evidence
Yeah.
- Yeah?
This makes no sense to knuckle down on them right now.
A brief reprieve, all right?
So suck it up.
Hey, yo, why you got to lock the door?
Yo, man, why you got to lock the door, man?
There' s no fucking time.
Shut up!
I don' t give a fuck about...
Hey, look me in the eyes.
I know you.
You that thing fool killed Elvin, man.
How do you know that?
Blow his own spot, man?
What the fuck you talking about?
Who do you think snitched you out to Dowd about being a fucking cop, man?
You think that shit fell out of the fucking sky or something, man?
Come on, man, he came after you after Calvess told him you was 5- 0.
He' s a cop...
He' s one of me, my man.
What the fuck you think we making this shit up for, huh?
We ain' t got nothing to gain from this shit.
They both dead anyway.
Yo, man, you think Calvess is some kind of a fucking saint, man?
That motherfuck... that motherfuck...
We have seconds.
Make every single one of them count.
Before he left, he yelled at you.
You yelled back and you said he knew who killed Calvess.
That means that your fucking partner Oak is dirty, man.
He' s fucking lying to you.
What?
What did you say?
- He' s lying to you.
- He' s lying to me?
Yeah, he' s lying.
What' s he lying about?
He' s lying about what went down in that tunnel.
About who killed that cop.
Just about everything.
It' s' cause he was there.
He was where?
Motherfucker.
In the tunnel.
That morning, Calvess came around, he told everybody he wanted to get some get- high.
6: 00 in the morning.
"this shit better be worth my while.
You knew him by his real name?
Yeah, he came on for a couple of weeks.
Said his name was some Frederick something.
Jimmy Fredricks, yeah, go.
Yeah, but he got strung out, man.
Blew his own cover.
So you knew.
Just like everybody know that you and a handful of motherfuckers was cops.
You know, he kept us out of his reports.
Tipped us off to who was getting fucking raided, who was getting got.
We kept him high.
You say he supplied you with IDs?
Uh- huh.
He supplied you with police IDs?
All kinds of shit, man... badges, IDs, guns.
Whenever he had no money, he' d come trade up shit.
That morning, that morning, what was his condition like that morning?
He wasn' t looking too good, man.
Talking all kind of crazy shit.
Hands looking all shaky.
So we show up in the morning.
He got no money, nothing to trade.
What the fuck was I supposed to do?
I ain' t givin 'him shit.
But you know, this motherfucker starts straight trippin ', man.
Talking about he' s going to arrest us and take us in if we don' t comp his ass.
Then Oak showed up.
Where?
On the other side of the tunnel.
Did he say anything?
Calvess seen him at the same time.
This motherfucker just flipped.
Talking about arresting us.
Started reaching for his gun.
I hit him, man.
'Cause he was reaching for his gun, you hit him?
Man, I ain' t trying to get shot by nobody.
Especially no fucking junkie all of a sudden trying to be a cop.
So what then?
Latroy hit him in his face once, then I kicked him again to keep him down.
And then we ran.
And then Oaks started shooting.
The lieutenant fired on you?
How many times?
Three, four times.
Yeah, right here.
Tell me, fucking quickly, tell me what happened then.
Go.
When we was running, we heard Oak yelling at Calvess.
What the fuck are you doing, Mike?!
That' s when he did it.
He did what?
That' s when he killed him, man.
What' d you say...
Fucking Calvess was a junkie.
He blew his cover and Oak killed him, man.
Give me a straight fucking face and say that to me.
Huh?!
You- you think he ain' t capable of some shit like that?
Like he ain' t got it in him, man?
He come there and see his partner all strung out there.
You guys think that this is my first fucking walk in the park?!
Huh?!
You cop to selling to an officer, you cop to assaulting an officer, but now you won' t cop to fucking killing him.
Because you want to fucking spin some fucking bullshit
It' s over, man.
Yeah?
- It' s over, man.
It is fucking over!
Because I gave you a fucking shot to set it straight, Darnell, and you fucking pissed it away!
Both of you pissed it away!
So all this shit that' s coming down, you brought all this shit on yourself!
You must be suspicious.
If you wasn' t, then why the fuck you lock the door, huh?
The only thing you need to know about me, is that I' m going to bag the motherfuckers that killed Mike.
Where we grow up, man, you kill a cop, they will crown you king motherfucking con.
You understand what I' m saying?
But there ain' t nobody here talking about killing no cop.
Oak come here, trying to fucking stick this shit to some niggas because he know that anytime you stick some shit to some niggas, it' s gonna stay stuck.
Yo, when- when did you find that gun in there?
Huh?
That gun Oak found, Calvess' gun.
You the first one that looked in that trunk.
Did you see a brown bag in there with no gun?
- Oh, God...
It came up when your back was turned.
Yo, don' t you see?
Hey!
Hey!
Open the goddamn door!
Why don' t you dust the prints and let' s see whose prints come up off of there.
I' il bet you all the prints that come up off of there
- belongs to your man Oak.
- That' s right.
He planted it, man.
You got ten fucking seconds, front to back, for the record now.
Go.
Open the door!
Tellis!
What the fuck was going on in there?
Why' d you just fucking lock me out?
Huh?
I just asked you a question!
Were you tailing Calvess the day he was killed?
- You heard me!
Did he compromise his cover?
And were you tailing him as a result of that?
You talked to them after I left?
The Mossberg off Leflore.
Dekolvie' s ID and badge.
You heard them!
They' re claiming Calvess supplied them with stolen police- issued to make junk buys.
'Cause I am having a hell of lot of trouble figuring that out!
Exactly how long after I left did you let those liberal stirrings in you spill out all over the fucking floor?!
The position I' m in...
Now, were you following him?
I need to know, and I need to know that now.
No.
I was not tailing him.
But you were there before he died.
You were there before he died.
Tell me that I' m wrong.
You wanna fucking talk?
All right, we' il talk.
Mike was making a bust that morning.
He had enough going against him to make an arrest.
He needed backup.
Off- roster.
Because he wanted to bring 'em in on his own.
So I stayed back.
I waited, and the buy went bad.
Then how come you couldn' t identify those guys in there right away?
They shot him, but... you shot them as they fled the scene.
What?
What did they say to you?
When that motherfucker Oak starting shooting, he shot Calvess, killed Calvess.
You must be out of your fucking mind!
As much as he meant to me, you call on my integrity?!
My commitment to that kid?!
You' re going to let these fucking lowlife pieces of shit smear that?!
We' re bringing 'em in.
You' re fucking with something you can' t possibly understand.
I' m taking 'em in.
It' s over now.
You fucking joke.
You know that?
You' re a fucking joke!
Your whole career is a fucking joke!
You popped that needle freak in the park and in the process, you hit that fucking woman with a stray bullet, costing her a bouncing baby!
- Fucking her up for life!
Enough!
Stop!
Shut the fuck up!
You' re a lie.
Fucking lie.
Got this from Child Welfare.
Kathryn Tunney.
November 23, 1985, declared ward of the state.
Placed with foster parents.
Do you know that little girl, Lieutenant?
I think you do.
You sealed the records till she was 18.
She' s been in an out of trouble for years and years in and out of foster homes.
Mostly drug related.
You had 'em all squashed.
You bailed her out of rehab.
Lots of times.
When she was a minor, you needed a doctor to sign the release, so who did it?
This is a good friend of mine, Art Harlan...
See, I saw the signatures.
Shit... you made sure that Harlan was the acting M. E. On the Calvess case, didn' t you?
Calvess?
What the hell you doing with that?
I thought we were closing out.
So he could doctor the autopsy, right?
Alter the lab reports, make 'em look clean.
Make Calvess look clean.
He' s as dirty as you are.
A filthy, fucking, needle- ridden junkie.
And you fucking knew it, you motherfucker.
You motherfucker.
I' m calling this in, right now.
Your gun and your shield, on the ground, now.
I am so far from fucking with you.
You' re pointing a gun in face.
You' re threatening my life.
I' m going to take your life.
Gun and shield on the ground, now.
You' re a fucking lie.
You just wanted me to back your bullshit.
Sell your story so you could railroad those poor pricks...
Pulled her out of all that shit, didn' t you?
You just couldn' t afford to break her heart again.
You just couldn' t do it.
I get it, man.
He was a fucking addict.
I mean, how long before he started pimping her out, right?
It' s all hopeless, right?
Everything you did was hopeless, didn' t matter.
Oh, good.
Yeah... kill me.
Kill me just like you killed him.
Come on, buddy.
I' m going back in there and finish this up.
Come on.
Go home.
Destroyed his life, his family.
So now you two are going to tell me that you killed him.
You overpowered him, and you shot him.
Say it.
You say it, and you get out of here.
You think I' m fucking with you?
You think I' m fucking with you?
You ready to talk?
You ready to talk?
This is Calvess' gun.
This is the gun that you used to kill him.
See the gun?
Take it in your hand.
With his gun!
Now you are going to tell me calmly.
Remember, I got two bullets left.
One for this head...
Lieutenant...
Say it.
Say Calvess.
Step away from the suspect!
Calvess!
Shut up!
Shut up!
- I killed Calvess.
Don' t you fucking
leave me with this, Oak.
I need to know,
There was no fucking bust.
You were there to fucking kill him.
That' s what you did.
You knew what he was.
You knew what he was.
You used the junkies.
I know you fucking did, and you killed him.
You got to fucking tell me that.
Open your fucking eyes and tell me that.
- They ruined him.
They made him a junkie.
The department... takes everything.
The family gets nothing.
Kathy gets nothing.
That' s not what I want.
You tell me the fucking truth.
Look at me.
Do not fucking go!
Tell me!
Shut the fuck up.
What the fuck are you doing here, man, huh?
What you doing, Mike?
- I' m taking you out.
- No.
I' m taking you out, Mike.
I' m getting you help.
No, you are not taking me anywhere!
I' m not going out.
You' re high right now.
You know what you' re doing to Kathy?
You know what you' re doing to the girls, Mike?
You know what they mean to me, and you' re fucking that up!
You' re pissing away your entire life, Mike.
I won' t have it!
I heard about this, and I fucking waited.
I ignored it.
Why Kathy didn' t tell me, I have no idea, but that' s it, it' s over.
I' m sorry I took so goddamn long, but it' s over.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Mike.
Oh, my God.
Mike?
Mike?!
Mike!
Jesus Christ...
Oh, Mike.
Oh, my God, I' m sorry.
Oh, my God, I' m sorry.
For all those who wanna analyze me
For all those who wanna analyze me
Starts off in the hips, and move to the lips
For all those who wanna analyze me
My mother committed suicide when I was four or five
I love Mike- O was killed by a psycho
But I' m not sad or sorry
'Cause we be tomorrow
'Cause we be tomorrow
For all those who wanna analyze me
For all those who wanna analyze me
My mother committed suicide when I was four or five
I love Mike- O was killed by a psycho
But I' m not sad or sorry
'Cause we be tomorrow
Next month, next week
I guess I' m weak, I guess I' m weak
But I' m not sad or sorry
Train passes where they prosecute
So be careful where you tread
'Cause we be tomorrow
It' s a land mine, baby
Suicide when I was four or five
Don' t go losing your head, just remember our love
Mike- O killed by a psycho
Sad or sorry...
That was the summer of 1963, when everybody called me "Baby" and it didn' t occur to me to mind.
That was before President Kennedy was shot, before the Beatles came, when I couldn' t wait to join the Peace Corps and I thought I' d never find a guy as great as my dad.
That was the summer we went to Kellerman' s.
Oh, my God.
Look at that!
Mom, I should' ve brought the coral shoes.
You said I was taking too much.
Well, sweetheart, you brought ten pairs.
But the coral shoes matched that dress.
This is not a tragedy.
A tragedy is three men trapped in a mine or police dogs used in Birmingham.
Monks burning themselves in protest.
Butt out, Baby.
Okay, we got horseshoes on the south lawn in 15 minutes!
We' ve got splish splash, the water cliffs, down by the lake.
And for you older folks, we got sacks!
Doc!
Max!
Well, doc, after all these years I finally got you up on my mountain.
So, how' s the blood pressure, Max?
I' d be standing here dead.
- Billy, get the bags.
- Right away, doc, right away.
I kept the best cabin for you and your beautiful girls.
Hey, thanks a lot.
You want a job here?
Used to be a Rockette.
It' s his first real vacation in six years, Max.
Take it easy.
Three weeks here, it' il feel like a year.
One, two, three, four!
Stomp those grapes and stomp some more!
One, two, three, four!
Listen to the music!
Sorry.
Try your caboose and shake it loose!
One, two, three, four!
Start the trance!
Now come on, men!
Follow me into a round robin!
Ladies, the inner circle!
God wouldn' t have given you maracas if he didn' t want you to shake them!
Okay now, ladies, when I say "stop", you' re gonna find the man of your dreams.
Stop!
Now remember, he' s the boss on the dance floor, if nowhere else.
Mom, Dad, I' m going up to the main house to look around.
There are two kinds of help here.
You waiters are all college guys and I went to Harvard and Yale to hire you.
And why did I do that?
Why?
This is a family place.
That means you keep your fingers out of the water, your hair out of the soup and show the goddamn daughters a good time.
All the daughters.
Even the dogs.
Schlepp 'em out to the terrace, show' em the stars.
- Romance 'em any way you want.
- Got that, guys?
Hey, hold it!
Hold it.
Well, if it isn' t the entertainment staff.
Dance with the daughters.
Teach 'em the mambo, the cha- cha, anything they pay for.
But that' s it.
That' s where it ends.
No funny business, no conversations and keep yer hands off!
It' s the same at all these places.
Some ass in the woods, but no conversation.
Watch it, Rodriguez.
What you can and can' t lay your hands on?
Just put your pickle on everybody' s plate, college boy, and leave the hard stuff to me.
Sit down, sit down and I' il get you some wine.
Thank you, Max.
This is Dr. and Mrs. Houseman, Baby, Lisa.
Tthis is your waiter, Robbie Gould.
Yale medical school.
Robbie, these people are my special guests.
- Enjoy.
- Thanks, Max.
Oh, look at all this leftover food.
Are there still starving children in Europe?
- Try Southeast Asia, Ma.
- Oh, right.
Robbie, Baby wants to send her leftover pot roast to Southeast Asia, so anything we don' t finish, you wrap up.
Max, our Baby' s gonna change the world.
- And what are you gonna do, Missy?
- Oh Lisa' s gonna decorate it.
She already does.
Doc, I want you to meet someone.
My grandson Neil.
Goes to the Cornell School of Hotel Management.
Oh, Baby' s starting Mount Holyoke in the fall.
Oh, great.
Are you going to major in English?
Economics of underdeveloped countries.
I' m going into the Peace Corps.
I' m going to Mississippi with a couple of busboys, freedom ride.
This is our own Tito Suarez.
Come on!
Who' s that?
They' re the dance people.
They' re here to keep the guests happy.
They shouldn' t be showing off with each other.
That' s not gonna sell lessons.
- Yeah.
Actually, I' ve gotta excuse myself.
I' m in charge of the games tonight.
Say, would you like to help me get things started?
Sure she would.
This' il only hurt for a minute.
You' ve got Blue Cross, right?
Was that good for you?
And for being such a good sport, here you go!
You know, I finally met a girl exactly like my mother.
So I brought her home.
My father doesn' t like her!
Go figure.
- Hi.
- How' d you get here?
- I was taking a walk.
- No.
What' s up there?
No guests allowed.
House rules.
Why don' t you go back to the playhouse?
I saw you dancing with little boss man.
Can you keep a secret?
Your parents would kill you.
Max would kill me.
Where?
I don' t know.
Kids are doing it in their basements back home.
Wanna try it?
Come on, Baby.
Can you imagine dancing like this on the main floor, home of the family fox- trot?
Max would close the place down first.
That' s my cousin, Johnny Castle.
He got me the job here.
- Yeah.
You' d think they werea couple, wouldn' t you?
- Aren' t they?
- Nah, not since we were kids.
Yo, Cous, what' s she doing here?
She came with me.
She' s with me.
I carried a watermelon.
I carried a watermelon?
Bend your knees.
Down.
Watch my eyes.
Good.
That' s better.
Now roll this way.
Now watch.
Look.
I feel like such an asp.
You look ten years younger.
So I say, "Ask not what your waiter can do for you, but what you can do for your waiter."
You know, if tips keep up, I' il have enough for my Alfa Romeo.
That' s my favorite car.
Ladies, you look very lovely.
Baby, would you cover for me tonight?
Tell Mom and Daddy I went to lie down.
Where are you going?
To the golf course.
There' s a pretty view from the first tee.
Thanks.
So, you were really a Rockette?
I think you' re a wonderful dancer.
Yeah, well, my mother kicked me out when I was 16.
I' ve been dancing ever since.
It' s the only thing I ever wanted to do anyway.
I envy you.
- Aren' t you dancing, doc?
- We' re waiting for a waltz.
Hi, Max.
Aren' t my dance lessons starting to pay off?
You look great, Vivian!
Terrific!
That' s Vivian Pressman, one of the bungalow bunnies.
That' s what we call the women who stay here all week long.
The husbands only come up on weekends.
He' il join our game.
- Moe coming up on Friday?
- Friday.
He' s away a lot.
I know.
It' s a hardship.
Where' s Penny?
Everybody' s been asking for her.
She' s taking a break.
She needs a break.
As long as it' s not an all- night break.
Let' s take a walk.
I love to watch your hair blowing in the breeze.
Maybe my parents are looking for me.
Baby, don' t worry.
If they think you' re with me, they' il be the happiest parents at Kellerman' s.
I have to say it.
I' m known as the catch of the county.
- I' m sure you are.
I took a girl away from Jamie, the lifeguard.
And he said to her, right in front of me, "What does he have that I don' t have?"
And she said, "Two hotels."
Robbie.
I don' t hear an apology.
Go back to Mommy and Daddy and keep listening, Lisa.
Maybe you' il hear one in your dreams.
I' m sorry you had to see that.
Sometimes in this world...... you see things you don' t wanna see.
You hungry?
Come on.
So, Baby, what do you want?
You can have anything you want.
A brownie, some milk, leftover rice pudding...... beets, leftover cabbage roll...
... fruit salad, sweet gherkins?
Yeah.
Why' s she here?
- I brought her in case Neil comes back.
- Penny just doesn' t think.
She wouldn' t do anything stupid, would she?
So, what' s wrong?
What' s the matter with her?
- Billy!
- What' s he gonna do about it?
- "What' s he gonna do about it?"
Oh, it' s mine, right?
- Right away you think it' s mine.
- But I thought the...
I' m never gonna let anything happen to you.
We got to go.
Just hold on.
Good girl.
Good girl.
What do you think you' re doing?
I' il take care of it.
Forget it, Johnny.
I' m not taking what' s left of your salary.
- Penny, that' s my business.
- Besides, it wouldn' t be enough.
Oh, God, it' s hopeless!
Don' t say that.
There' s gotta be a way to work it out.
Is that your name?
Well, you know what, Baby?
You don' t know shit about my problems.
I told her.
Jesus, Billy!
Why not skywrite it?
Robbie?!
- Look...
- No, Baby, Baby.
One of the counselors knows a doctor, a real MD, just traveling through New Paltz for one day next week.
We can get her an appointment, but it' d cost $250.
But if it' s Robbie, there' s no problem.
- I' m sure if you tell him...
- He knows.
Baby.
And just where do you get off telling me what' s right?
- But you can' t just leave her.
I mean...
- I didn' t blow a summer hauling toasted bagels just to bail out some little chick who probably ball every guy in the place.
A little precision please, Baby.
Some people count and some people don' t.
Read it.
I think it' s a book you' il enjoy.
I have notes in the margin.
You make me sick.
Stay away from me, stay away from my sister or I' il have you fired.
What am I doing wrong?
You' re lining it up a little wrong, Marge.
You know, if your mother ever leaves me, it' il be for Arnold Palmer.
- Daddy, someone' s in trouble.
- Besides your mother?
Now, you' re overcorrecting, Marge.
You always told me if someone was in trouble, I should try to help.
Could you lend me $250?
Are you all right, Baby?
Are you in some kind of trouble?
No, no, it' s not me.
Could you loan it to me?
That' s a lot of money, Baby.
What' s it for?
Baby, stand up straight.
I can' t tell you.
It' s hard for me to say that to you, but I can' t.
You always said you could tell me anything.
I can' t tell you this.
It' s not illegal, is it?
No, Daddy.
Forgive me.
I' il have it for you before dinner.
- Fine.
Thanks.
Here' s money.
- You mean Robbie?
- No, you were right about him.
- Then where' d you get it?
- Is this kid for real?
- Yeah, takes a real saint to ask Daddy.
Thanks, Baby, but I can' t use it.
What' s the matter with you?
You should take the money.
I can only get her an appointment for Thursday.
They do their act at the Sheldrake on Thursday night.
If they cancel, they lose this season' s salary and next year' s gig.
What' s the Sheldrake?
It' s another hotel where they do their mambo act.
Can' t someone else fill in?
No, "Miss Fix- it".
Somebody else can' t fill in.
Everybody works here.
What, do you wanna do it?
You wanna take time out from "Simon Says"?
It' s not a bad idea.
It was a joke, Billy.
She can move.
No, it' s the dumbest idea I ever heard of.
- I can' t even do the merengue.
- See?
Johnny, you' re a strong partner.
You can lead anybody.
She can' t even do the merengue.
She can' t do it.
She cannot do it.
- Oh, sorry.
Oh!
You don' t step on the one.
Find the two.
You understand?
Now, it' s one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.
Got it?
Relax, relax.
Breathe.
Nope.
Again.
- My fault.
Two, three, four, two, three, four.
Lifting up.
Two, three, four.
Shoulders down.
Again.
And concentrate.
Don' t put your heel down.
Don' t put your heel down.
I...
- You stay on the toe.
Just listen to me.
The steps aren' t enough.
Feel the music.
It' s not the mambo.
It' s a feeling, a heartbeat.
Don' t try so hard.
Close your eyes.
Two, three, four, two, three, four.
Two, three, four, two, three, four.
Breathe.
Head up.
Lock your frame.
Lock it.
Look, spaghetti arm.
This is your dance space.
You gotta hold the frame.
Frame.
Back.
Easy.
And turn, turn.
And lift - you' il learn that later.
And come on.
Twist.
- Sorry.
- You trying to kill me?
You gotta concentrate!
Is that your idea of fun?
Oh yes, as a matter of fact it is.
We' re supposed to do the show in two days, you won' t show me lifts, I' m not sure of turns.
I' m doing all this to save your ass, but what I' d really wanna do is drop you on it!
Let' s get outa here.
Shit!
I locked the keys in the car!
You' re getting wet, right?
- You' re wild.
- What?
You' re wild!
Now, the most important thing to remember in lifts is balance.
I got it now.
So where' d you learn to be a dancer?
Well, this guy came into this luncheonette one day and...... you know, we were all sitting around doing nothing.
And he said that Arthur Murray was giving a test for instructors.
So, if you passed...
... they teach you all this different kinds of dances, show you how to break 'em down, how to teach' em, you know.
What?
No.
Good.
And...
Now, bend your knees and go up.
Go, go.
Good try.
Now, you' il hurt me if you don' t trust me, all right?
Now go, go.
Now, I' m gonna go up, all right?
You know, the best place to practice lifts is in the water.
You just bend your knees.
And... go.
Good.
Good.
Hold it.
Good.
Don' t break!
Don' t break!
Let' s do it again.
One, two, three.
Oh, sorry.
Good.
No, don' t!
It' s not too bad.
- Okay.
Go.
I can' t believe it' s tonight.
Is Sheldrake' s 20 minutes away?
We' il change in the car.
Mrs. Schumacher.
Hey, Mrs. Schumacher, wait, we' il help you.
Benny Bernstein' s Dancing School ever you be?
That' s where I went.
George Burns was a teacher.
- You' re welcome.
So I' il just keep my shoulders down, my head up...... my frame locked, stay on my toes...
What if I forget the steps?
And remember, let him lead you.
No.
I' m gonna...
I don' t look at my feet, keep my head up, my eyes open...... tension in my arm, my frame locked, seat pulled up...
Thanks, Baby.
Look, I just want you to know that I don' t sleep around...... whatever Robbie might have told you.
And I thought that he loved me.
I thought it was something special.
Anyway, I just wanted you to know that.
So, how does it look?
I' m scared.
I' m so scared, Baby.
Don' t worry.
You' il be fine.
You' il be fine.
- Could be.
Who knows?
Lisa, you just gotta do something for me.
I don' t just gotta do anything.
Just tell Mommy and Daddy I' ve got a terrible headache and I' m in bed and check on me once, okay?
'Johnny Castle and partner in "Mambo Magic."'
Relax.
Cross- body lead.
Wrong way!
Over here.
Ready for the lift?
Come on.
Keep goin '.
You worked hard.
Oh, me too.
Me too.
You know, but... by the second turn you really had it.
- You did real good.
Johnny!
Come on.
It' s Penny.
- She wouldn' t go until you got back.
- You didn' t call an ambulance?
She made me promise.
He didn' t use no ether, nothing.
I thought you said he was a real MD?
I could hear her screaming in the hallway.
And I swear to God, Johnny, I tried to get in, I tried.
It' s all right.
Johnny' s here.
What is it, Baby?
- No.
Excuse me.
Everybody clear out, please.
We' re gonna take care of that.
- I am.
Please, is she...
Doc, thanks a lot.
Mr. Houseman, I don' t know how to thank you, to tell you..., to...
Was that what my money paid for?
I never meant to lie to you.
You' re not the person I thought you were, Baby.
But I don' t want you to have anything to do with those people again.
- But can I just explain...
You' re to have nothing to do with any of them ever again!
I won' t tell your mother about this.
Right now I' m going to bed.
And take that stuff off your face before your mother sees you!
Is everything all right, Jake?
Go back to sleep.
Can I come in?
I guess it' s not a great room.
No.
This... it' s a great room!
No, leave it on.
I' m sorry about the way my father treated you.
I mean, he was great.
Yes, but I mean the way he was with you.
It' s really me it has to do with.
No.
The way he saved her...
I mean, I could never do anything like that.
That' s not true!
You... you' re everything!
You don' t understand the way it is...... I mean, for somebody like me.
This month, women are stuffing diamonds in my pockets.
I' m balancing on shit, as quick as that I can be down there again.
No, it' s not the way it is!
It doesn' t have to be that way!
I' ve never known anybody like you.
You look at thew world and you think you can make it better.
Somebody' s bleeding and...
Yeah, I go get my daddy.
That' s really brave, like you said.
That took a lot o 'guts to go to him!
I mean... you' re not scared of anything.
I' m scared of everything!
I' m scared of what I did, of who I am.
And most of all I' m scared of walking out of this room and never feeling the rest of my whole life...... the way I feel when I' m with you!
Dance with me.
What, here?
Here.
- So, everyone gonna be in the show?
- We' re leaving tomorrow.
Miss the weekend traffic.
Daddy, and miss the show?
I said we' re leaving tomorrow.
But Daddy, I was going to sing in the show.
It' s the big event.
You don' t wanna miss it.
Oh Baby, I need you for props.
Jake, why would you wanna leave early?
It was just an idea.
We can stay if you want to.
So, Lisa, what were you planning to sing?
Or "What Do the Simple Folk Do?"
Or "I Feel Pretty."
What do you think, Daddy?
You look much better.
You just missed your father.
He' s such a wonderful man.
I' m sorry.
I didn' t realize...
Oh, you couldn' t have.
- So, how you doin '?
- I' m okay.
Dr. Houseman says I' m gonna to be fine.
I can still have children.
Oh, Penny, that' s great, that' s really great.
- So, how did it go last night?
- Good.
Fine.
I didn' t do the lift, but it was good.
I guess I' m gonna go.
Bye.
- So, he says you' re gonna be fine, right?
- Johnny, what are you doing?
How many times have you told me never get mixed- up with them?
I know what I' m doing, Penny.
You listen to me.
You' ve got to stop it now.
Look...
They kill each other if I' m not there.
You gotta go.
I' m so sick of this rain!
Remind me not to take my honeymoon at Niagara Falls.
So, you go to Acapulco.
It' il be fine.
Where is my beige iridescent lipstick?
I know I put it in this drawer.
Baby, where are you going in this weather?
Uh, they' re having charades in the west lobby.
Oh, quite the little joiner, aren' t we?
- What?
- Have you had many women?
- Tell me.
I wanna know.
Look... you gotta understand what it' s like, Baby.
You come from the streets and suddenly you' re up here.
And they really take care of themselves.
I mean...
I' d never known women could be like that, you know.
And they' re so rich, they' re so goddamn rich you think they must know about everything.
- different women.
So here I think I' m scorin 'big, right?
And... oh why, you think "Hey..." "... they wouldn' t be doing this if they didn' t care about me, right?"
That' s all right.
You were just using them, that' s all.
No, that' s not it.
That' s the thing, Baby, you see.
It wasn' t like that.
They were using me.
What' s your real name, Baby?
Frances.
For the first woman in the Cabinet.
Frances.
That' s a...... that' s a real grownup name.
I' ve decided to go all the way with Robbie.
Oh Lisa, no, not with someone like him.
Do you think if we came back here for a tenth anniversary, it would be free?
It' s... it' s just wrong this way.
Oh come on.
You don' t care about me.
You wouldn' t care if I humped the entire army...... as long as I were on the right side of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
He listens when I talk now.
You hate that.
Hey!
My frame.
Where' s my pleasing arc?
Spaghetti arms!
Would you give me some tension, please?
You' re invading my dance space.
This is my dance space.
Let' s cha- cha.
Don' t look down.
Look right here.
Baby, takin 'dance lessons?
I could teach ya, kid.
Johnny, my grandfather put me in charge of the final show.
I wanna talk to you about the last dance.
I' d like to shake things up a bit.
- Yeah.
- Yeah...
I' ve got a lot o 'ideas.
- Like those...
Now...
I thought, you always do the mambo, huh?
Now, why not dance this year' s final dance...... to the pachanga?
Right.
-... who' il only be too happy...
No problem.
We' il end the season with the pachanga.
Great idea.
Sometimes he' s hard to talk to, but the ladies seem to like him.
See that he gives you the full half- hour you' re paying him for, kid.
That little wimp.
He wants some new ideas.
I could have told him some new ideas.
Oh, why did you let him talk to you that way?
What do you mean, and fight the boss man?
Yeah, tell him your ideas.
- He' s a person like everyone else and...
- Look, I know these people, Baby.
They won' t listen to me.
Make them listen.
Because I need this goddamned job lined up for next summer.
My dad calls me today.
He says:
"Good news," you know, he says, "Uncle Paul could finally get you in the union."
Oh, what union?
The House Painters and Plasterers, local number 179, at your service.
I' ve been thinking a lot about the Domino Theory.
Now, if Vietnam falls, is China next?
I don' t think they saw us.
Fight harder, huh?
I don' t see you fightin 'so hard, Baby,
I don' t see you runnin 'of to Daddy tellin' him I' m your guy.
- I will tell him.
- I don' t believe you, Baby.
I don' t think...... that you ever had any intention o 'tellin' him.
Ever.
Hi, have you seen Johnny?
I' m sorry.
Hey, well, it looks like I picked the wrong sister.
I went slummin 'too.
Hit me.
Hit me.
Get outa here.
You' re not worth it.
Win big, Moe.
- As always.
This is our last night together, lover.
I' ve got something worked out for us.
Oh, excuse me, sir.
The pirate number' s next.
Oh yeah, thanks.
Hey, kid.
Listen, you know I' m playing cards all weekend and I' ve got an all- night game tonight.
Why don' t you...... give my wife some extra dance lessons?
I' m sorry, Mr. Pressman, but...... I' m booked up for the whole weekend, you know, with the show and everything, so I won' t have time for anything else.
I don' t think it' d be fair to take the money.
I' ve decided tonight' s the night with Robbie.
He doesn' t even know yet.
It' s me.
Holy shit!
You wanna hear somethin 'crazy?
"Come on," and he put his arm around me...... just like he did with Robbie.
You know how you feel when you see a patient and...... you think he' s all right, then you look at the X- rays and this is nothing like you thought?
What happened, Max?
It' s exactly what it' s like when you find out one of your staff' s a thief.
Moe Pressman' s wallet was stolen when he was playing pinochle last night.
It was in his jacket hanging on the back of his chair.
He had it at 1: 30 and when he checked again at quarter of four...... it was missing.
Johnny walking by.
"You have an alibi for last night?"
He says he was alone in his room reading.
Yeah, there are no books in Johnny' s room!
There' s been a mistake.
I know Johnny didn' t do it.
There' ve been similar thefts at the Sheldrake and it' s happened here before.
- Three other wallets.
- I know he didn' t do it.
Wait.
Don' t put those tables together.
Come on.
Daddy, I need your help.
Oh?
How do you know?
I can' t tell you.
I' m sorry, Baby.
I can' t.
- This Danish is pure protein.
- Mr. Kellermanm, look.
Maybe Johnny didn' t do it.
Anyone could' ve taken it.
You know, it could' ve been that little old couple, the Schumachers.
- I saw her with a couple of wallets.
- Sylvia and Sidney?
Baby, you don' t go around accusing innocent people.
Yeah, but I saw them.
I even saw them at the Sheldrake.
Didn' t you say something was stolen at the Sheldrake.
Come on, Neil.
You' il learn what it' s like to fire an employee.
No, Mr. Kellerman, wait a minute.
I know Johnny didn' t take the wallet.
I know he didn' t take it, because he was in his room all night.
And the reason I know...... is because I was with him.
I told you I was telling the truth, Daddy.
I' m sorry I lied to you.
But you lied too.
You' ve told me everyone was alike and deserved a fair break.
But you meant everyone who was like you.
You told me you wanted me to change the world, make it better.
But you meant by becoming a lawyer or an economist and marrying someone from Harvard.
I' m not proud of myself.
But I' m in this family too and you can' t keep giving me the silent treatment.
There are a lot of things about me that aren' t what you thought.
But if you love me, you have to love all the things about me.
And I love you.
I' m sorry I let you down.
But you let me down too.
I have been lookin 'for you all over.
They found the Schumachers.
They found out they were wanted in Arizona and Florida and they made a fortune here this summer.
So then... then it' s all right.
I knew it' d work out.
- I knew they' d have to apologize...
They fired you anyway because of me.
And if I leave quietly, I' il get my summer bonus.
So I did it for nothing.
I hurt my family, you lost your job anyway - I did it for nothing!
No, no, not for nothing, Baby!
Nobody has ever done anything like that for me before.
You were right, Johnny.
You can' t win no matter what you do.
You listen to me.
I don' t wanna hear that from you.
You can!
I used to think so.
- I know what you must be thinking...
Anything at all.
The kind of person that does things to make other people look up to them.
Dr. Houseman, Baby is like that!
I mean, if you could just see...
Don' t you tell me what to see.
I see someone in front of me who...... got his partner in trouble and sent her off to some butcher, while he moved on to an innocent young girl like my daughter.
Yeah, I guess that' s what you would see.
I can' t imagine me being here without you even one day.
Well, I just think, you have more time for... horseshoes and croquet.
Maybe they' il... saw you in seven pieces now.
I guess we surprised everybody.
I guess we did.
Hardly would be sorry.
Neither will l.
I' il do your hair.
It could look pretty if...
You' re prettier your way.
This way.
Good luck in medical school, son.
And I wanted to thank you for your help with the Penny situation.
What?
I thought Baby told you.
I mean, Penny said so, but...... you know with girls like that.
They' re liable to pin it on any guy around.
Finished.
We' ve seen it all, eh?
Through the war years when we didn' t have any meat.
Through the Depression when we didn' t have anything.
Lots of changes.
It' s not the changes so much this time, you know.
It' s that it all seems to be ending.
You think kids wanna come with their parents and take fox- trot lessons?
Trips to Europe, that' s what the kids want.
Twenty- two countries in three days.
It feels like it' s all slipping away.
Nobody puts Baby in a corner.
Come on.
Sorry about the disruption, folks...... but I always do the last dance of the season.
This year somebody told me not to.
So I' m gonna do my kind of dancin 'with a great partner...... who' s not only a terrific dancer...... but somebody who' s taught me...... that there are people willing to stand up for other people, no matter what it costs' em.
Somebody... who' s taught me...... about the kind of person I wanna be.
Miss Frances Houseman.
Sit down, Jake.
I think she gets this from me.
Do you have sheet music on this stuff?
I know you weren' t the one who got Penny in trouble.
When I' m wrong, I say I' m wrong.
You looked wonderful out there.
I want you to talk about women.
Mr. Crown?
- I' m sorry.
- Women.
You' ve yet to talk about women.
I enjoy women.
Enjoyment isn' t intimacy.
Intimacy isn' t necessarily enjoyment.
How would you know?
Has it occurred to you that you have a problem with trust?
I trust myself implicitly.
Yes, but can other people trust you?
You mean society at large?
I mean women, Mr. Crown.
Yes, a woman could trust me.
Good.
Under what extraordinary circumstances would you allow that to happen?
A woman could trust me... as long as her interests didn' t run too contrary to my own.
On society at large... if its interests were to run counter to your own?
Jimmy, I think I' il walk for a while.
I' il meet you at the office.
- No, I' il carry it.
Whoa!
Jesus Christ!
Look at this jerk.
Morning, Mr. Crown.
- Bobby.
- Back for your haystacks, huh?
Don' t ever let it go on tour.
Oh, I' il lay down the law.
You' re an odd duck.
Everybody else goes right for the Monet.
It' s very nice.
Nice?
Do you know what it' s worth?
I just like my haystacks.
Yo, you gonna move it?
Move it.
Jesus Christ.
Bring it on.
Something' s screwed up.
My list says some kind of sarcophagus.
What do you want me to do?
It' s a horse.
You want I should take it back and dump it?
Just unload the damn thing.
Boy, it' s gonna be hot today.
- Good morning, Mr. Crown.
You can' t let 'em know what' s going on.
Know what I mean?
- What, do you own the building?
- Excuse us, sir.
What the hell?
What' s going on?
He does own the building.
- Good morning, Mr. Crown.
- Good morning, one and all.
- Good morning, Mr. Crown.
- John, welcome back.
Give me good numbers, Jimmy.
Good morning, Daria.
Good morning, Mr. Crown.
You forgot your briefcase, right?
I must' ve left it here last night.
We have a disparity here.
I saw that.
Well, we can' t leave it here.
Let' s find out what the problem is.
That is not a sarcophagus.
- It' s Friday.
- What did he mean by that?
I' d say come Monday there' s gonna be hell to pay.
Times in this thing I never thought I' d see that.
Thomas Crown forced to sell something.
So what do you think?
You don' t have any regrets about the way you played this?
Regret is usually a waste of time.
As is gloating.
Have you figured out what you' re gonna say to your board... when they learned that you paid me 30 million more than others were offering?
Good morning, gentlemen.
All right, English only from now on.
Gentlemen, upon closer inspection... your proposal is not as generous as you led us to believe.
There is no mention of executive compensation.
Look, gentlemen, we understand your objection to the merger.
- It' s not a merger!
- Your stockholders have spoken.
- The stock price was manipulated.
- We' ve anticipated your reluctance.
- We won' t be a Crown subsidiary.
- Our attorneys are prepared... to go head- to- head with you at the SEC.
I thought that kid would bust a gut when you went into that thing about SEC.
- That was brilliant!
- How' s it go?
It' s sad to see another tired man --
Lay down his hand and quit the holy game of poker.
That' s the line, Danny.
He' s right, you know.
Third generation company, you think they would have shown more grit.
Don' t forget about the Douglaston conference call in ten minutes.
Miso soup, Daria.
- On its way.
Go, go, go!
This painting is considered to be the first lmpressionist work in history.
It started the lmpressionist Movement.
It influenced major artists who went on to found the first major school... or style of the 20th century.
Try this.
It' s worth a hundred million bucks.
And the government guy we paid off to make the state deal is back.
Screw 'em.
- Daniel, you had turkey.
- Mr. Schmidt called from UBS.
- Douglaston conference call, 10 minutes.
Young lady... do not touch.
I' il let you go this time.
On your way.
Jimmy, would you take a look in the compressor room?
There' s something wonky with the A. C.
- Can' t we pass it on to Engineering?
- The book says we check it first.
All right.
It would be one of the hottest days of the year.
Can you believe it' s nearly October?
- Why don' t you bring the kids?
- Are you kidding?
You know how she is.
She' d probably run to court saying I was endangering them.
You' re not kiddin '?
You wouldn' t believe the shit the woman deals out.
The whole air- conditioning plant' s crapped out.
Why didn' t they call Maintenance?
- See you in the morning.
- Found your briefcase, I see.
- Evidently.
- Good night, sir.
Here you go.
Thanks.
They want to talk to you upstairs.
Me, or the regular proctor?
Because McKinley' il be back in a couple seconds.
I think you should talk to them.
Call them if you like.
Administration.
Hello?
This is Jeff in wing eight.
I was just told you wanted to speak to me.
I' il be right up.
I' il just go up.
Sorry.
I' il have to ask you to leave.
This exhibit is now closed.
Please use the nearest exit.
This exhibit is now closed.
We are closed for the evening.
Please exit through the rear.
- Thank you.
Right this way.
- Good night.
Thank you very much.
This exhibit is closed.
What have we got here?
It' s only a quarter to 5: 00.
We are closed.
For cleaning.
- Hey, Bobby, I' ve been evicted.
- What do you mean?
Cleaning?
Doing it right now.
Ed, want to lend me a hand here for a minute?
Certainly.
Excuse me.
What do you think you' re doing?
What?
Upstairs sent us down to clean this exhibit.
They' ve got some VlPs coming through.
I didn' t hear about it.
I oversee this section.
Call upstairs if you like.
No, you' re right.
They' ve been having people down here all week.
Stop him!
Watch it now!
Look out, Mr. Crown.
One at a time.
Quickly.
No need to panic.
Thank you.
Hold it right there.
Freeze!
Keep your hands up!
Sixty- Eighth and Lexington.
- Good evening, sir.
- Hey, Paul.
Wanna put this in the study?
- I set out a bottle of wine.
- Thank you.
I may have won a cruise.
Mikey.
- They find the chopper?
- Abandoned in Queens.
- We know where it was stolen?
- Checking.
Maybe a pad in the Hamptons.
Mr. Lenox.
Mr. Lenox is the director of the museum.
This is Detective Michael McCann.
Sorry to be here, sir.
- Who are the actors?
- Four, all foreign.
Probably Eastern European.
No print records.
Illegals.
Check with lnterpol.
Russian government might help.
Point of entry was a hollow statue delivered this morning.
They brought it in through their own security.
Next you' re gonna tell me it was a horse.
- A Trojan horse?
- Bingo.
- Somebody' s got a sense of humor.
- We got three digits of the truck plate.
- This place been hit before?
- They just lost their cherry.
I gather it was just the one painting?
But it' s such an important one.
It' s a seminal work, a historical watershed.
It' s truly irreplaceable.
I love this neighborhood.
Some of these broads are wearing my salary.
So the skylight was rigged to blow?
Yeah.
And there were cargo nets spread out ready to use.
And they were wearing rappelling harnesses underneath their clothes.
Let' s just track this thing through.
So, they kill the air... make the place uncomfortable, drive out the tourists, right?
Then they lower these gates so nobody can get in to disturb them.
Then they lower the paintings into the cargo nets.
Pull the paintings, ditch the frames.
Figure they' re gonna fly out of here like a road company of Peter Pan.
But somebody makes them early.
Chopper takes off.
Some of the crew make it, some of them don' t.
Basically, amateur night, right?
What' s that?
It was wedged under the gate.
And?
Not exactly Samsonite.
Titanium.
The engineer said that it' d have to absorb... 15 to 20 tons to stop this gate.
Seems there may be a couple of holes in your theory.
They shut off the air to drive out the tourists... then they escort them out anyway?
Then they close the gates to keep everybody out... but block one of them open while they prepare to load conservatively... a thousand pounds of paintings and 800 pounds of men... that we know about, in a --
What was the chopper model?
Sikorsky S- 76.
Right.
In a chopper with a 600- pound useful load.
You figure you' il wrap this by morning, do you, Lieutenant?
It' s Detective.
- I' m sorry.
- Of?
Zurich underwriters requested -- Well, actually --
So, I' m stuck with you on my back.
Come on, Lieutenant.
You might enjoy it.
Thousand bucks says you can' t do that again.
Tony, put another ball down there.
Tommy, it was a figure of speech.
Let' s make it interesting, shall we?
I' il take your money.
Let' s go again.
Still ten to one.
That' s $100, 000 on a goddamn golf swing.
It' s a beautiful Saturday morning, John.
What the hell else do we gotta do?
She does live in Europe but she' s actually from the Midwest.
- Born Catherine Olds.
- Who' s Banning?
Some Englishman she married for six months.
- So she' s not law enforcement.
- Worse.
Bail bonds and bounties.
Whoa, tough people.
Her father' s an Ohio hardcase, Clarence Milton Olds, called Bumper Olds.
Story goes he kept a chain on his back bumper.
A guy ran on him once, he brought him back on the end of the chain.
Guess you don' t wanna cross old Clarence.
Good morning.
How are you?
I said, how are you?
Thank you.
What is that?
You don' t wanna know.
These are yesterday' s tapes from the lmpressionist wing.
Why are they different from the corridor cameras?
We' re upgrading to thermal imagery.
So far, it' s just the high value areas.
Even senses body heat.
So that' s the Monet that morning.
- Right.
- Skip forward to the robbery.
- Whoa.
Zip.
Was the camera still working, or what, did they cut the feed?
- That' s why they cut the air.
- You know, that could be.
These things need a ten- degree difference.
If the temperature of the ambient gets within ten degrees of the bodies --
Then the camera can' t tell between people and walls.
How hot did it get in the museum?
Check the other cameras.
So why can you see people in this room?
The ambient in that room only went up to the mid- 80s.
Wait a minute.
You' re telling me that for some reason... the area around that particular painting went above 90?
What?
Something.
What, are we channeling now?
How long you been doing this?
A while.
- Where? ln Europe?
- And other places.
You' re a real self- promoter.
Give me a for instance.
- How many legs?
- What?
The bench.
Two.
You still have that tape up?
Great.
Back it up to the morning part of the tape.
Stop.
Hello.
Jesus.
So they bring this thing in earlier in the day.
It could be a heater.
- What?
- In the briefcase, on a timer.
Bring the temperature up ten more degrees.
You ever eat?
Lunch, for instance?
You like pizza?
I know a great place we could stop.
I' m on London time.
And pizza' s not your thing.
What' s the matter, Lieutenant?
Did she leave you for a stockbroker?
It' s Detective, First Grade.
And he was a urologist.
Can I drop you someplace?
At your hotel?
One, I keep an apartment here, and two, I' m going to your office.
She keeps an apartment.
I keep goldfish.
Hello there, little lady.
How are you doing?
- Detective.
- They don' t seem to be Russian.
Tadross thinks maybe Romanian.
- The witness is here.
Come on in.
Number four.
You' re sure?
I' m sure.
- Would you mind indicating that here?
And if you could sign down here, please.
These gentlemen will take you out, finish the paperwork.
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you very much.
We' re gonna go beat up the Romanians.
Thank you, thank you.
Wait a minute.
I' m gonna go get some coffee.
- That sums it up, gentlemen.
- And you' d be willing to testify?
Absolutely.
You realize they might try to make it ugly for a witness.
I understand, gentlemen, and I guess I' il take my chances.
We' il nail these jokers.
I can' t imagine somebody thinking they' d get away with a thing like this.
They say anything yet?
Not in English.
They' re still trying to find somebody to translate.
- Let me try.
- Do not tell me you speak Romanian.
God, who would ever bother with Romanian?
Give me the quiet one.
They do speak English.
It was a prepackaged robbery.
He picked them up in Little Odessa.
They were given timetables, electrical --
Who' s "he"?
You don' t think they know, do you?
I mean, there were intermediaries.
They never saw his face or heard his voice.
One- time hires.
That' s why they failed.
What makes you think they failed?
Oh, maybe it was a successful robbery.
Maybe they were set up to fail.
- Diversion.
Make a lot of noise over there... so over here in this room you can take a hundred million off the wall... and waltz right out the front door.
- Oh, that' s good.
- Doesn' t matter.
As soon as he tries to sell it, we nail him.
He' s not gonna sell.
He' s not?
This is an elegant crime... done by an elegant person.
- It' s not about the money.
So who' s gonna risk prison to steal a Monet... just to not sell it?
A Monet lover.
Whose desk is that?
- Could I use it?
Sure.
Let' s dig up every major auction in the last five years... and see who' s been bidding on Monets.
See anyone we know?
Him?
A big day for this guy is taking off his tie.
He' s a finance geek.
Is he?
- How' s that?
Go, go!
Ease up.
Come on!
Let' s go!
I saw him wreck a $100, 000 boat because he liked the splash.
Do you have any idea what kind of flesh- eating lawyers this guy has?
- Hmm?
- Mm- hmm.
Not to mention political connections.
Mr. Thomas Crown has very generously loaned us... a Pissarro until our own Monet is restored to us.
Come on!
I' m afraid Jim embellishes horrendously.
I just did what Jim does at these fund- raisers.
I waved my arms in the air... and shrieked for help.
Hello, Gloria.
Lovely to see you.
- I knew him, you know.
- Did you, madam?
- His son, that is.
Lucien Pissarro in the '30s in Paris.
It' s very impressive.
Well, it seemed the right size for the space.
Or maybe you were bored with it.
Do we know each other?
Not yet.
I' m Catherine Banning.
Thomas Crown.
- Vodka rocks, twist.
And scotch neat.
- How did you know that?
- I' ve been reading about you.
- Oh?
- In a file.
Who do you work for?
I' m in the art world.
- Dealer?
- Mm- mm.
Gallery owner?
No, it' s closer to insurance.
I' m covered.
Not for this.
The painting?
The Monet?
You don' t think they' d simply cut a check for a hundred million dollars... do you?
- So you -- - Get them things.
When it' s this much money involved, it usually means I get them someone' s head.
- Yours.
Good evening, Mr. Crown.
Are you trying to --
Are you trying to imply that I had something to do with that painting?
Trying?
Thank you.
No, I wouldn' t call it an attempt.
- What' s your take from this?
- Five percent of the value recovered.
A bounty hunter.
- If you like.
- Always get your man?
- Mm- hmm.
Think you' il get me?
Oh, I hope so.
Can I drop you somewhere?
I have a car here.
Then tomorrow?
Us, dinner?
You' re on.
Let' s make it early.
We' ve got a stop to make first.
- What' s happened?
- Happened?
Whenever I talk while you' re tuning out what I say... the corners of your mouth go up.
You' re enjoying something.
It' s not me.
What is it?
- An entertainment.
- Very little entertains you.
So I can easily guess.
A worthy adversary?
Did someone swindle you?
You waltz in there without even a heads up... without one word to me or anyone else in the department.
I had a little chat with him, yes.
You had a little chat.
You told him balls- out he was a suspect.
I cut through the crap.
How long was it gonna take you, Mike?
Weeks of wire taps, if you could get them.
Guys tailing him to the bathroom.
I found out in ten minutes.
He did it.
The smug son of a bitch did it.
- You compromised the investigation.
Oh, really?
What do you have to show for it, besides a date?
The man likes the high wire.
I' m gonna play with him for a while.
Well, I think there' s some question as to who' s playing whom.
You saying I shouldn' t go?
We' re on this.
This is a warrant.
I' d let us.
Jack, give me two men up here.
I want two more men in this room here.
- Come on.
Let' s go.
John, take the back room.
You want help in here?
Mr. Crown.
Thank you.
Why are you in my house?
Wallace?
This gentleman happens to be my attorney.
Keep your knickers on.
I' il get into his house.
- You look wonderful.
- How are you?
- Popular.
Man, you' re not gonna believe this.
You know where he' s taking her?
To the museum.
- He' s takin 'her to the fucking museum.
You know, for a first date.
Hey, I didn' t know your portrait was here.
The faceless businessman in a bowler hat.
Everything but the briefcase.
Did you have to sit long for the artist?
Actually, I do own a copy of that.
Oh, of course you do.
- And where might you be taking me?
- Come, come, come, come.
Good evening, sir.
The museum is closing in 15 minutes.
Thank you.
- Your loaner.
- That' s the least I could do.
I see they got the air back on.
I shouldn' t have checked my coat.
Well, thank you.
I wouldn' t have taken the Monet.
- No?
What would you take?
For my personal choice?
That one.
You?
You' d like to have that?
Why?
Will you get it for me?
Anything' s obtainable.
Okay, I' il bite.
What would you do to get it?
I' d buy a print.
It looks like they' re going into Cipriani.
I thought they were supposed to go to Le Cirque.
I' m watching them walk into Cipriani.
And with no reservation.
Scotch neat for me, and I guess the lady would like a --
What?
That the lady actually likes champagne.
We have Krug Grand Cuvee 1981.
- Sounds great.
- Wonderful.
You' ve been busy.
I' m sure your files are thicker than mine.
The thing that impressed me most... was getting from Glasgow to Oxford on a boxing scholarship.
Not bad for a wee lad from "Glasgee."
It was easy.
Rich kids can' t box.
The hard part was learning to talk.
But you, now.
The matador?
The ltalian industrialist?
- The ambassador' s son?
- He was 17.
- Yes, he was.
I must admit, that' s a fair litany for a young girl from Lima, Ohio.
But the part I didn' t get -- I mean, it' s obvious that you like men... but you never keep any of them around very long either.
Oh, well, men make women messy.
Thank you.
Here' s to the fear of being trapped.
- Here' s the fish for the lady.
- Thank you.
And the lamb chops for the gentleman.
We' d like to pre- order souffles.
And I' d like to send a bottle of burgundy to those two gentlemen.
Of course, sir.
Enjoy.
Thank you.
The ones yesterday looked like flashers.
- Well, we do our best.
- I' m under glass.
Soon you' il know everything about me.
- Like what?
Like why.
Were you bored?
Acquisitions and mergers looking a little stodgy?
Is it more fun getting it than keeping it?
- Is this the fun part for you?
It' s not about the money.
You like the chase.
Not many women get to chase.
It' s like poker.
We don' t let you in the game.
My brothers said I didn' t have the mind for it.
- And now they' re plumbers.
- Oh, but you knew that.
Can I ply you with anything else?
- Nothing.
- Cheese tray?
Would you like a -- - Would you like a deal?
Make it easy on yourself.
We' il just get more warrant searches.
Mess up your carpeting.
May l --
May I ask you a very personal question?
Why not?
Would you like another hit of espresso?
- Would you like another -- - Like another hit of espresso?
- That' s the very personal question?
- That' s as good as it gets.
Excuse me.
- May I ask you a very personal question?
- Oh, sure.
Do you really think I' m going to sleep with a man I' m investigating, hmm?
- Is that the question?
Why should I answer your question when you didn' t commit to my espresso?
I' il seriously commit to your espresso.
- I' d let you in -- - But the world is watching.
- Yes, they are.
- And besides... you' ve got no furniture.
Oh, that' s good.
That' s very good.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Alone?
- Ready?
- Okay.
Ground.
Okay.
Ten.
Eleven.
Twelve.
Thirteen.
Fourteen.
Fifteen.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
Eighteen.
Nineteen.
Got it.
- You' re slippin ', Larry.
Give me a break, all right?
Guy' s got a ten- digit PlN.
- You got it.
- Excuse me.
- Is that it?
- She got it!
Excuse me.
- Is the expert here?
- Ready and waiting, darling.
- Let' s see what you got.
Look, this is George French, head of forensics.
Hi, George.
This is Dr. Cornelius of Manhattanville.
- This is Catherine Banning.
- How do you do?
Well, go to work, Doctor.
Don' t glare at me, Michael.
So are the laws of the United States... completely unknown to you?
Or is it because you' ve been living in fucking Morocco?
- Mogambo.
It' s illegal entry, theft, trespassing.
- I' m not a cop.
If you were a cop, you' d know that this won' t hold up.
- Don' t you want him to go up for -- - My job is the painting.
You' ve got a ghost here.
What?
Another painting underneath.
Monet reused his canvases.
Monet' s unknown masterpiece...
"Dogs at Cards."
Where is that sack of shit?
Where is he right now?
- Excuse me?
- I' m cutting in.
It' s all right.
I' il see you later.
It' s a black and white ball.
Oh, so.
I wasn' t invited anyway.
- You left yourself wide open.
- You' re all flushed.
How many people can forge a Monet?
I' m sure I can' t be arrested for a joke.
- Oh, but this was a little too good.
- You think you' re just inches away.
You think I' m just gonna peck at crumbs you lay out?
I can smell blood on my own.
You smug son of a --
Do you want to dance... or do you want to dance?
Get away, get away!
You are the most remarkable woman.
You don' t think we' re finished, do you?
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Paul.
- Can I get you anything else?
Not a thing.
- Thank you, Paul.
- Thank you, Paul.
I suppose you didn' t just run out for that.
Damn, I hate being a foregone conclusion.
You live very well.
It' d be a shame to lose it all.
That depends on a very large presumption.
Yes, it does.
I won' t back off, you know.
Not even for a minute.
I' d be hugely disappointed if you did.
How do porcupines mate?
Old joke.
Very carefully.
Carefully... or unsuccessfully.
Don' t see many porcupines.
Creatures with highly evolved defense systems.
Like porcupines.
Like 42- year- old, successful, self- involved loners.
If you' ve found a female mirror image... and think you' re going to form a rewarding relationship --
Think again?
Good morning.
Nice dress.
Looks like it was a great party.
Mm- hmm.
You gonna be a cliche?
- Did you even think twice?
- No.
- You knew what you were doing.
- My job.
He likes me.
- Keep him right next to me.
- You don' t care what that makes you?
- I know what I' m doing.
- Do you really?
This is just about money, Mike.
He' s got a problem.
- I could get used to this.
Hold on?
Why?
All right!
- You' re gonna take the stick.
- Take the stick.
- I' m not taking --
Put your hands on the stick.
Just put it right -- That' s it.
- That' s good.
- Oh, my God!
Head for that hill over there.
Head for the hill.
Don' t lose it.
There you go.
This is ridge- running.
We' re doing it.
- I' m in your hands.
- Just feel that.
Feel that movement?
- I do.
To the left.
Pick up a thermal coming over the hill.
Just like a hawk.
Cows.
We' re only about four states from your car.
That island isn' t Manhattan.
It' s not?
I have appointments.
Wanna keep 'em?
Door' s welded.
Throw your leg over.
Throw my leg over?
Oh, that' s beautiful.
- Oh, this must go over.
- With whom?
Whomever you bring here.
I never bring anyone here.
I bet they' re all my size, huh?
Might be off a little here and there... but I think they' il make do.
I' il go make dinner.
- You want some wine?
Yes.
It' s beautiful!
Wanna see it?
Are you sure?
I' m sure.
Would you like a splash?
Come here.
Wanna see it?
You sure?
You think I believe you' d leave your hard- stolen painting lying around a hut?
What if I did?
- And that you' d tell me?
- What if I trust you?
You know you can' t.
You don' t believe it' s possible that you could ever trust me, do you?
You know how likely I think that is?
Excuse me.
Should I open another bottle?
Yes.
I think so.
- I think so.
- No, it' s -- it' s not at all.
A truce would be good.
That' d be good.
What was it?
- It' s a nice little Renoir.
- Oh.
Renoir.
Nice little copy?
We' il never know, will we?
- Okay, I give up!
- Think I' il get that bottle.
That would be good.
I' il give you that.
- You' ve complimented me.
- They were bankers.
- Who?
The suits.
You' re transferring assets, getting ready to run.
And suppose I did run?
Then what would you have?
Suppose I gave you ten.
To fail?
- How would I hide it?
- I' d teach you.
You really think there' s happy ever after for people like us?
So just how big of a thief are you?
Well, if you count Wall Street... pretty big.
I' m just an amateur.
Beginner' s luck, huh?
Gentleman jockey wins the Derby.
Something like that.
Well, you got your hand caught in the cookie jar now.
How are you gonna get out of it?
It' s just a game, love.
Just a game.
- Nice tan.
Went to the beach a couple days.
- On the job?
- That' s right.
And did you pick anything up?
He' s got an ornament worn by Frederick Barbarossa at his coronation in 1152.
Really?
Stolen?
So, that' s it, huh, after two days and two nights?
That was it.
Would you like to know where he was the night before he left?
Or after he left you last night?
Not really.
Okay, suit yourself.
She' s...
striking.
Three dates in six days.
Where does he find the time?
You okay?
You know, I was okay once.
My girlfriend got drunk.
Stayed out all night, came back in the morning married.
I told people I didn' t care... and then I fucked five women in three days... flipped my car on an on- ramp... beat a suspect unconscious, got suspended.
But I was okay.
Is there a point to this story?
They both had to come out of the same building.
- Photos of the borders of the Monet.
- Before insurers indemnify a painting... they remove it from the frame and photograph the borders.
Borders are never seen in galleries or auctions, so if a picture is stolen... and someone tries to pass off a forgery, the borders won' t match.
And if the borders do happen to match?
Then the forger was in the presence of the original painting.
So, if Crown' s prank Monet happens to be too good --
Then we find the forger and nail the bastard.
- How long have you had these?
- And you didn' t open them?
- Yeah, well, they' re open now.
- You' re not gonna say...
"I couldn' t possibly"?
I wouldn' t say anything that boring.
She' s an old friend, but it' il be like having dinner at a morgue.
You know, it occurred to me, I might be able to bear it if you came with me.
Tomorrow?
That' s so soon.
I sense hesitation.
Do you find my company monotonous?
Because I' d hate to think you could.
What, be bored by you?
Require a little variety?
You' re referring to Anna.
- They photographed me with Anna.
- You know, that' s your prerogative.
I thought they were.
I let it happen.
- You wanna know why?
I' il tell you why.
- I wanna tell you.
- You know what?
I don' t wanna know why.
- Jimmy, I' d like to get out.
- Jimmy, keep driving.
- I don' t wanna know why!
- Just let me tell you why!
- Now ask me why!
- I don' t wanna know!
- Yeah, because that' s what you wanted.
I needed you to be upset.
He' s sadistic.
- Did it occur to you I needed to know?
- Know what?
Know whether all it was to you was the painting.
How else could I know?
What about you?
I can leave here tomorrow.
So can you.
- We' d be fugitives.
- Fugitives with means.
All the difference in the world.
I don' t know.
Peter Pan decides to grow up and finds there' s no place to land.
The only sad part is... if she' s anything like you... she won' t know what she' s lost until it' s gone.
- Hey, let' s go.
The painting' s borders match perfectly.
Then again, I' m sure you knew that, didn' t you?
Let' s go meet some forgers.
I was never an lmpressionist.
- Anyway, I pay taxes now.
- Doing what?
Portraits.
Inserting the rich into old masterpieces.
The wife' s face on the Mona Lisa.
From Brooklyn to Greenwich in one generation... you gotta have the paintings to match.
So, who did it?
The German.
Heinrich --
Knutzhorn.
Art' s a small world, Michael.
So who do you think did this?
Frederick Golchan.
He said you did.
So you think if I want paint, it just comes FedEx... and the guards just think it' s therapy... while I madly copy a Monet in my cell from the original?
What?
- What?
- Nothin '.
I was just wondering about what he wouldn' t say.
Give.
There' s nothing.
Life is full of shitty conflicts, okay?
Give.
I just wondered if there was a connection between them, that' s all.
Between Crown and that old man?
You are spooky.
You are really spooky.
They owned a gallery together -- Crown and Knutzhorn.
In Berlin, 1990.
And another one in Hamburg and one in Paris in '94.
You notice the one- man show in Paris in '95?
The artist is Knutzhorn.
So look at the first name.
Tyrol Knutzhorn.
Yeah, we spoke to a Heinrich.
You know what it was?
The way he smiled at the painting?
Paternal pride.
- I bet you it' s his son.
- Son of a great forger... who paints as well as Dad.
Just hasn' t been caught yet.
Well, I assume if you look... you' il find Tyrol Knutzhorn lives in New York.
You know what? l --
I owe you an apology.
I didn' t think you had the chops to see this through.
- Well, you don' t know me.
I bet you' d stand at the pearly gates and kick St. Peter right in the teeth... before you' d let somebody play you.
Harold, listen carefully.
If I had to be gone, and I mean seriously gone, in about eight hours... how much could I take with me?
Are you all right?
Understand?
I understand that, and that can' t be helped.
But what could I leave with?
Call me back in an hour, I' il have a number for you of some kind.
Leavin 'us?
No, you' re not that lucky.
I' m organizing.
No Knutzhorn' s ever been to see the old man.
There was a Knudsen, though, three times last month.
You think that' s just a coincidence?
Probably is.
Look, here' s an extra hundred.
Just go, go!
- He' s in a meeting.
- It' s very important.
I' il get him.
Ma' am, wait.
I know we have a plug adaptor.
I just can' t find the bloody plug adaptor.
Would you go downstairs and --
Well, we seem to have backtracked.
Take your hands off me!
Like who that girl is and why she' s here always --
Anna works for me.
Oh, you never thought I was a fool before.
She' s here because I owe her money and I wanted to pay her before I go.
And what is it she does for you?
I would be compromising her to say.
Oh, Tommy, you' re going away together.
No, I' m going with you.
Of all the things in the world to take with a leap of faith.
- How can I possibly trust you?
I' m gonna trust you.
Isn' t that what you wanted, my trust?
I' il put the Monet back.
Hanging back on the wall in the museum?
You know, Tommy, I' m all checkmated out.
If the painting' s back, we' re free of it all.
We' re only for each other.
Back on the wall in the museum?
And you' il meet me at 4: 00... at the Wall Street Heliport and we' il leave together.
Or --
Or you can have them at the museum waiting for me.
I' m trusting you.
I can' t.
I can' t do that!
Damn you, you son of a bitch!
Get away!
I need to talk to you.
You' re in the lobby, right?
Yeah, Mikey, I' m here.
Me and about 30 other guys.
Let up on yourself.
You did the right thing.
Assuming the son of a bitch shows up.
Mark, stay with the car.
Get a uniformed man on the fire escape.
Detective.
She leave anything behind?
Just stake out the whole place.
Maybe she' il come back again.
Put Jack on the phone.
Get Jack.
- What?
- Forger.
You didn' t think we just dropped that, did you?
Jack ran it down this morning.
It was a daughter, not a son, and she was under our noses the whole time.
Tyrol Anna Knudsen -- Knutzhorn.
Crown' s known her since she was ten.
When her father went to jail, Crown became her guardian.
Put her through college, for Christ' s sake.
Now she works for one of his companies.
Jack, here' s what I want you to do.
- He' s in.
- Got him.
That' s him.
Overcoat and briefcase.
Yeah, Mikey, we got him.
Center entrance.
Bring up the lobby on the big monitor.
Move in quietly.
We don' t wanna make a scene.
It' s almost like he wants to make sure we see him.
Let' s play ball.
There he goes.
Bowler hat.
Move it.
Quietly.
Excuse me.
Shit, he switched the painting.
Stay with the painting.
What?
I can' t --
Shit!
Where is he?
What the hell --
- There' s guys with bowler hats -- - All over the goddamn place.
- Did you warn him?
- What?
No!
- Then he knew you were gonna betray him.
They' re going for the stairs.
Now we got four floors to keep track of.
Stay with him.
He disappears, it' il be ten years before he surfaces again.
- Is the lmpressionist wing sealed off?
- Completely.
- Gates are down.
If he tries to put the painting back, I guarantee it won' t be in that room.
- Got 'em coming out of the woodworks.
- What' s the deal?
He' s going the other way.
- Where are you?
I can' t hear you.
This is ridiculous.
He' s got us running around in circles.
Paretti' s trying to reach you.
I' m coming down.
What do we do?
Start arresting people.
Come on.
One moment.
Shit!
I knew it.
- Coming through.
- Get the civilians out of here.
How do we get this gate open?
Kill the sprinklers in the lmpressionist wing now!
It' s water paint.
It' s been here the whole time.
From what, one, two days after the robbery?
There' s something jammed in the track.
Returned the damn thing practically as soon as he stole it.
- Oh, Lord.
- Oh, dear.
This -- This can' t be.
It simply can' t be.
Now, how the hell did he do that?
Where are you goin '?
Oh, office.
Write up my report.
- Yeah.
So, the other painting, why do you think he chose that particular one?
I have no idea.
But it' s not insured by my people, so I' m out of it.
Obviously, you' il still have to pursue it.
I don' t really give a shit.
You don' t care if you catch him?
I' il do what they tell me to do.
- Did you ever care?
He pissed me off.
I nailed two crooked real estate agents... and a guy who was beating his kids to death.
I don' t really give a damn.
You' re a good man.
Get out of here.
And tell him I said hello.
I have no idea what you' re talking about.
And don' t stiff us for your phone bills.
Taxi!
You know, I' m just gonna run.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
You can' t go out there without an escort.
You would be Catherine?
He wanted you to have this.
Good day, ma' am.
How can I help you?
I have a reservation.
Okay, Miss Banning.
Will you be carrying any luggage today?
This should take care of it.
- That' s fine.
Departures for international flights are up the escalator to your left.
Ma' am... is everything all right?
Everything' s fine.
You don' t need to cry there, lassie.
Did you set this up?
Did you set this up?
Miss, please, the seat belt sign is still on.
I' il tell you what.
I' il break both your arms.

Your memory will never return.
I' m certain of it.
Still... we must release you into the real world.
Good luck out there.
Hey... how much?
How much...
Huh?
Who are you?
Are you hungry?
Come on.
You can live here with me.
It' s Pinocchio.
Then what is the number for?
Then I guess I' il call him...
Pinocchio
Starting today... you' re going to learn our language.
First say PlNOCCHlO...
Pi - no - cchi - o.
I' m not joking!
I spent a lot of money!
So what are you going to do about this situation?
I' ve never seen such an impotent bastard before!
He doesn' t know what an erection is!
I' m sorry Narishima isn' t here.
Sorry.
Yes...
I can' t make a comment on that.
Yes... yes...
He' il call you back.
Yes.
You' re so excited, aren' t you?
I will drive you insane tonight.
Stop that!
Stop doing that!
I' m so sorry madam.
We try to do our best for the client.
But remember, you' re dealing with living things.
You' ve lost my trust.
I will make it right again!
Save the speech!
I want another one.
One that is constantly erect!
I want this one!
A- ko, This one would be better for you.
Now we must discuss how we' il deal with your current 964.
Aah, That?
Nothing but rubbish.
What did you do with him?
I threw him out.
Is there a problem?
You made a big mistake...
We run the risk that everyone will know about this...
I will give you a new Pinocchio A- ko but if you do this again I will have to have you erased!
Such attitude!
You made the contract with him.
What is a Pinocchio anyway?
Try to say it; Pi - no - cchi - o!
Pi - no - cchi - o!
That' s good!
You said it!
That' s your name!
Pinocchio!
964 is missing.
- Oh no Look for him.
- Yes!
Wait!
We must keep it very secretive.
Find him quickly - Yes!
Himiko.
Pinocchio!
P- Pinocchio!
- Himiko.
Not Pinocchio...
Say Himiko.
- Hi- mi- ko.
Himiko...
Himiko.
What' s wrong?
Are you hungry?

What' s going on?
Please tell me!
I don' t know.
I' d like to know myself.
What' s going on?
Why am I here?
I don' t know anything!
What' s wrong with me?
Please tell me what' s going on!
Don' t panic.
Ok?
You couldn' t talk until just a minute ago.
You' re improving.
You look like you' re in a good mood.
Great huh?
The climbing season starts tomorrow.
Pass me the paper.
- Okay.
People like us will have a better life.
Then... we won' t need a memory to live in this town.
I' m getting something to drink.
Wait for me.
Let me ask you a question...
We' re looking for someone.
He has just a patch of hair.
No, he' s not totally bald, just a little patch in front.
He' s about this tall and his name is Pinocchio.
Thanks to the silly asses of the world...
I can make a fortune.
I am a Cupid for the people in the world.
I give old ladies with big tits a blow of sexual shock.
That' s the only way to save them.
Pinocchio!
What' s wrong with you?
What' s wrong with you?
What' s wrong with you?
What' s wrong with you?!
Let me see.
Move your hands!
Let me see it!
Move your hands!
I' il help you.
Come here.
Are you sure I' il be alright?
Don' t worry.
I' il take care of you.
What happened to you?
I don' t know.
It hurts really bad.
Pinocchio... it' il be alright.
You' il be fine now...... and forever.
Himiko!
You' re hurting me!
Ha!
I tricked your silly ass!
You stupid asshole!
Who will help you now?
You' il be like this forever!
Excuse me?
Excuse me?!
Excuse me?
You don' t have time to mess with people.
Are you hungry?!
Eat it more!
This is a great lunch for you!
Eat every bit!
Eat it!
Eat the noodles!
Don' t spit it out!
Eat the noodles!
More noodles!
Eat all of the noodles!
How' s does that taste?!
If I melt these metal cuffs and put them in your mouth...... you' il visit Hell!
Raw wheat... raw rice and raw eggs...... make them rot away... by putting them in your mouth.
Where is 964?
- Maybe he' s...
No!
This can' t be happening!
This is too weird!
Why can' t we find him?
He doesn' t think and he shouldn' t have a memory!
He' s a freak!
- Maybe he' s dead.
It would be very helpful.
Is the next Pinocchio ready for delivery?
Yes... but we don' t have enough for this month' s orders.
Shit!
What are you saying?
Keep selling them no matter what!
Idiots are everywhere!
Increase our production and sell them off!
How...
How do we do it?
Figure it out for yourself.
Just contact us when you find him.
Please wait!
Wait!
Please wait!
I don' t know what to do?
There he is.
You' re looking for Pinocchio, aren' t you?
How do you know about the Pinocchio?
- I know where he is.
How do you know anything about him?
You' il take all the credit.
You' il see.
Come on and hurry up.
While he' s still alive.
Pinocchio is in here.
Now what?
Is he dead?
- I don' t know.
I...
Don' t move.
I' il contact my boss.
Stay here.
A phone!
Hurry up and answer!
I found him!
I found Pinocchio!
Hold on Shimada.
He found Pinocchio.
Where are you?
I see!
Stay there!
Don' t try to do anything yourself.
Do you hear me?!
Okay!
Where is Nagashima?
- He had an emergency!
This is more important!
Where is he?
Kill her!
This is very toxic.
The gas will kill a person immediately without any sign of foul play.
What will we do with the 964?
Bring him back here.
He needs to be reprogrammed!
Yes sir, - Wait.
Look at this.
- You have ten bullets but one is enough.
Get a hold of Nagashima!
I' m not carrying this heavy thing!
You do it.
You' re a goody two shoes.
How does he expect me to find Nagishima?
Where the Hell is he?
But we...
I know we can' t adopt.
I don' t have time to wait.
I have to do it myself.
Otherwise...
I can' t wait forever.
That' s right!
My wife said we could adopt!
My wife will be happy with a daughter.
I did it.
I did it.
I have a daughter now!
All right, we won' t wait for that asshole any longer.
I' il show him!
We can do it alone!
Hurry up!
I' ve been waiting forever.
What are you going to do?
- Lets just do it.
We must kill her.
That woman.
Why?
Why do we have to kill her?
Why?
Shut up!
What the?
Don' t do it!
You asked for it!
Why?
Why isn' t he dead!
- Kill him or we' il die!
He' s not human!
Die!
Die!
How!
Himik- ooooooo!
What' s taking so long?
He' s our company' s secret!
Is everything prepared for the operation?
- Yes.
Bastards!
Those three are useless!
I pay them good money...
What fuck up' s they are!
I' m stressed out and pissed off and I' m getting very mad!
They' re eating up all of my money!
He' s getting out!
We must stop him!
We must kill him.
- We should go back now.
Where did he go?
- Let' s get back to the company!
What do I do?
- Come with me and hurry up!
Boss!
Help us Boss!
- What is it?
- He got away!
What?!
What the Hell were you assholes doing?
He recognized us.
He saw me and knew who I was.
What?
- It' s not possible...
His memory came back?
That' s what you said?!
This can' t be happening.
He' s coming here.
Who are you?
You must kill him!
Get away from me!
Here he comes!
He' s here.
He came to ask you for help!
What are you going to do?
- Shut up!
He' s just an idiot!
What will you do?
We must catch him!
Narishima!
Help me!
It' s impossible!
Fucking impossible!
Help me!
Please... help... me!
The only way we can help you is by killing you!
Monsters must be destroyed!
Don' t bother us!
Be nice and die quickly!
Help me!
Do something!
I hired you for this!
What do you expect me to do?!
What can I do?
Why do you always ask me?!
You said you would help me!
Why do I have to die?
I' m a genius...
Why?
Die!
Explode!
Help me.
Why don' t you help me?
Tear your face off!
Tear your own face off!
How does it feel?!
Oh...
This feels so good.
Everything is so clear...
- Good sleep?
- Not bad.
So where are we?
Where you from?
San Diego.
Left yesterday.
So you came Honolulu- Guam- Pago- here?
Long trip.
What do you do?
l’ m a psychologist.
Hey, a shrink.
They’ ve called in everything else.
How do you mean?
We’ ve ferried people out of Guam for the last 2 days.
Physicists, biologists, mathematicians, you name it.
Everybody being flown to the middle of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean.
What’ s going on?
They’ re not telling us anything, sir.
What did they tell you?
There was a plane crash.
Do you get called in on crashes?
l’ m on a list of psychologists the FAA brings in when a plane goes down.
So where exactly are we now?
That’ s where we’ re headed.
Over there.
Here.
Take a look.
What is that?
All that for a plane crash?
I never mentioned a plane crash.
- Any other gear?
Watch your step.
- l’ d like to call my family.
We’ il get you settled in quarters first.
Remain there till we send for you.
- l’ d like to get started.
- We’ il send for you.
- lt’ s critical I see them -- - Who?
The survivors. lf I don’ t get to them in the first 24 hours --
- What survivors?
- The survivors of the plane crash.
Plane crash?
I deal in post- traumatic stress and survival guilt.
Maybe I should talk to someone who knows what’ s going on here.
- Talk to the ship’ s psychiatrist.
- l’ m a psychologist.
That’ s why I was sent here.
I told you people I need a phone.
Discuss that with Mr. Barnes.
That’ s fine.
Give me a phone, l’ il call him.
Why are you here?
Take your hands off me, please.
Do you have any idea who I am?
Tell him the name of the book you wrote.
Astrophysics You Can Use.
It was a Book- of- the- Month Club Main Selection.
Never heard of it.
You really thought he read your book.
You haven’ t changed.
It was written for the layman.
He’ s not impressed.
ls there a phone in here?
- l’ ve been trying to call my wife.
- Would you stop touching me?
Wait a minute.
Beth?
Flight quarters.
All units make your flight quarters...... condition one stations for landing.
Stay clear of the fantail --
Goodman, you been here long?
- l’ ve been here 3 hours.
- Welcome aboard.
This thing scares the hell out of me.
lt’ s already too late.
You might as well helicopter me back...... because the damage is done to the survivors already.
We’ il get to that.
- I don’ t even know who you are.
I know who you are.
Military?
What are you?
You ever hear of the OSSA?
They don’ t know who I am.
That should reassure you.
You haven’ t talked to anyone about this?
- I talked to the helicopter pilot.
- What’ d you tell him?
I told him I was here to see the plane crash.
That’ s my job.
Plane crash.
Good.
There was no plane crash.
Spacecraft.
A spacecraft.
I guess that explains a lot.
- NASA?
- That doesn’ t surprise you?
At least it explains the secrecy.
The secrecy’ s critical, Norman.
You made that explicit in your report.
What report?
ULF.
I wrote that for the Bush administration.
And that’ s our bible here.
But that was a report about a possible encounter with an alien being.
You want to come with me?
Oh, boy.
About 3 weeks ago...... a ship laying fiber- optic cable between Honolulu and Sydney...... hit an obstruction 1, 000 feet underwater.
Cut this cable here clean as a shears.
The Navy got interested, sent out a search ship.
It turned out that what did it...... was this.
We took this with side- looking sonar.
This is an aerodynamic fin longer than a football field...... bigger than any known wingspan.
This is the fuselage.
This is ultrahigh- res SLS bottom scan.
Came in a week ago.
There it is, buried under about 8 yards of coral.
Something’ s wrong with that measurement.
Pacific coral grows an inch a year.
You can set your watch by it.
That’ s right.
So you’ re saying this spacecraft crashed in the year....
1709.
So you’ re saying this spacecraft crashed 300 years ago?
288.
That’ s impossible.
lt’ s not impossible if this spacecraft came from an alien civilization.
Wait a minute.
You think this is an alien spacecraft?
lt’ s not impossible.
lt’ s ridiculous.
We think there’ s an Unknown Life Form on the spacecraft.
That’ s why you’ re here.
You are the contact team that was recommended in the Goodman Report.
We have a biochemist...... to assess the physiology of the Unknown Life Form.
A mathematician, because that’ il probably be our common language.
And we have an astrophysicist to locate its place in the cosmos.
- Right.
Nowadays, the little green men say, ’ ’ Take me to your therapist ’ ’?
Listen up.
’ ’ Contact teams meeting an Unknown Life Form or ULF...... must be prepared for severe psychological impact.
Stress reaction of confronting such life has not been sufficiently studied...... and cannot be entirely predicted in advance.
But the most likely consequence of contact is...... absolute terror. ’ ’
That’ s from Norman’ s report.
l’ m sorry, are these parameters correct?
You’ re saying that you have a spacecraft over a half a mile long...... that crashed into the ocean 300 years ago and it’ s completely intact?
That’ s right.
And the kicker is, our sonar is picking up a low- level hum.
Something’ s still running inside.
There’ s no way this coral could’ ve grown faster than an inch a year?
That’ s what we’ re going there to see.
What?
Who says?
Harry, that’ s a joke, right?
This is the greatest scientific discovery since Copernicus.
Bigger!
The idea that we’ re not alone, it’ il change everything.
Evidence of extraterrestrial life.
You don’ t want to see that?
I got to say that I resent this briefing very much.
And how’ s that?
lf Norman’ s report calls for a biologist, a mathematician...... an astrophysicist and a psychologist...... why are you here?
Physical protocols start in a half an hour.
You always wear glasses?
I just started wearing these.
Are the glasses a problem?
I don’ t actually need them.
They’ re just for reading.
And they’ re more of a crutch.
I see fine without them.
But they didn’ t anticipate l’ d be going 1, 000 feet under the water.
Do you take prescription medication?
No.
None at all?
Once in a while sometimes I might take like a...... a piece of Xanax or something if l’ m nervous.
Something like that.
But not...... much.
Knee surgery.
Complete reconstruction of ACL, right knee.
Still have steel pin here, steel pin here, little medial collateral damage.
I see that you have a scar on your neck.
Car accident.
- Were you drinking?
- Yeah.
But I wasn’ t driving.
Wait, I just want to apologize for putting your name on the list.
Why?
When I made the report a few years ago, I picked names of people I knew.
And?
I know Ted because of his father.
- Yeah, so what?
- Beth was a patient.
lt’ s a bogus report.
What?
Did you tell Barnes?
You can’ t do that.
That’ s fraud.
They came to me, new administration, right?
They said, in case of an alien invasion, do’ s and don’ ts.
Why didn’ t you just say no?
$35, 000.
It paid the down payment on my house.
New administration wanted to prove they’ re doing something new.
How’ d you come up with this team...... of a biologist, an astrophysicist and a mathematician?
Right.
- How?
- I don’ t know.
It sounded good, right?
Made them come to me.
I forgive you!
But I don’ t forgive you for Ted.
He’ s a pain in the ass.
l’ il talk to him.
You don’ t have to be around him.
He idolizes you anyways, but l’ il talk to him. l’ il buy you dinner.
- l’ m sorry.
- Your secret’ s safe with me.
Come on.
l can’ t believe this thing could....
Like a dream.
Have you called your wife?
Why not?
This’ il be a saturation dive.
You’ il be going to a habitat in 1, 000 feet of water.
A sub will take you to the Habitat and you’ il transfer aboard.
At 1, 000 feet, your body will be pressurized for that depth.
The pressure wouldn’ t bother you.
Although I wouldn’ t recommend it because the water’ s so cold...... you’ d freeze to death in less than 2 minutes.
That’ s the reason for the diving suits.
Your helmet has a rebreather for your air supply.
Following this briefing, l’ il take you to an onboard dive tank.
For the next 8 hours...... you’ il train in deep- saturation dive techniques and emergency procedures.
Once you’ ve gone down 1, 000 feet...... if you surface, you’ il have to commit to several days of decompression.
There is no real quick return.
However, there is a mini- sub...... that may be used as an emergency escape vehicle.
But there must be a ship at the surface to mate to for decompression.
Without decompression, your body would literally burst.
Under these circumstances, you’ re very well- controlled.
The dive has been planned well and professionally monitored.
The descent will take about 13 minutes, descending at 80 feet a minute.
lt’ s going to get chilly.
Try to relax.
Next time, just tell us when you’ re going to push the button.
Mozart...... Horn Concerto in E- flat...... K- 447.
How you holding up, Captain Nautical?
- l’ m loose.
- You’ re loose?
l’ m loose. l’ m loose.
l’ m uptight.
- We okay?
- We’ re in the river now.
What river?
lt’ s a temperature/ salinity differential.
It flows like a river inside the ocean.
- Under the ocean and there’ s a river.
- That’ s right.
You okay?
Right now, l’ m not okay.
Would you please not touch me?
We’ re both nervous.
Yes?
Would you cut that out, please?
You’ re having a stress reaction.
That’ s Harry’ s stress reaction.
Those noises we’ re hearing, that’ s normal?
Those noises are the water pressure attacking the sub’ s integrity.
You know a little something about that, don’ t you, Norman?
How the pressure can attack your integrity.
Come on, you be nice this trip.
Were you nice last time?
You two want to sit together?
My God!
Norman, look at this, look at this.
Jesus!
That’ s just the fin.
That’ s the Habitat.
The Navy moved it in sections and set it up as a base...... as soon as the spaceship was discovered.
It' s manned by 2 naval personnel.
It will be your home- away- from- home while we investigate the spacecraft.
It ain’ t the Motel 6.
Approaching docking bay from R- 4.
All personnel, descent sub one engaging lock area.
You are now depressurized.
We’ re going to pressurize you now.
That’ s the helium.
- Helium?
- Was I the only one paying attention?
Oxygen is a corrosive gas, in the same family as fluorine and chlorine...... hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid.
That’ s why we’ re breathing helium.
Because oxygen at any level higher than 2. 3 becomes toxic.
Can you run that by me again, Ted?
I don’ t speak balloon.
What?
That’ s my voice.
The helium resonates differently with my vocal chords. ’ ’ Follow the yellow brick road. ’ ’
Kiddies, cut it out.
Put them on.
The Navy dive team is setting up a hydraulic robot...... in the air lock outside the spacecraft.
We’ il use that to open its door.
ls that the door?
Yeah, we used sonar imaging to pinpoint it before the divers went down.
- How tall is that robot?
- Five feet.
And it’ s roughly the same size as an airplane door, isn’ t it?
- Excuse me, Ted.
- I think that’ s worth taking note of.
Excuse me.
Tell them our team is in place and ready, okay?
This is Habitat to Navy dive.
Has it occurred to anyone maybe we shouldn’ t open that door?
Why do you say that?
We assume they’ il be green...... or insect- like, but basically human.
But what if they inhale air and exhale cyanide gas? lt’ s plausible.
Or live forever, like a virus or a yeast.
But why would you assume that a ULF would want to kill us?
An immortal creature wouldn’ t think killing was right or wrong.
lt’ d have no concept of it.
lnstant eradication. lt’ s what all the serious scientific stuff talks about.
What little there is on the subject.
You did put that in your report?
lt’ s in there.
Get us the ETD for team’ s departure to surface.
Tell them we’ re in ready and thank them.
Habitat to Navy Dive.
Our team’ s ready to take over.
Descent sub ready for your return to surface.
Thanks for all your help.
We’ il let you know what we find.
l’ m not too thrilled at the prospect of this.
What if you have to go to the bathroom?
Just go down your leg, Ted.
Really?
You can urinate in these?
You can.
The question is, do you want to?
Where’ s the switch?
Okay, let’ s go.
All right, Fletcher...... we’ re at 1, 022 feet.
The ambient temperature, 34 degrees.
Heading out north- northwest...... 330.
lt’ s a firm bottom.
lntermittent coral.
This is great, you guys.
Look at the size of that thing!
My God!
You see that tunnel?
That’ s where we’ re going.
lnto the heart of darkness.
We’ re in the coral pipe now, Fletcher, approaching the air lock.
l’ m feeling pressure in my ears.
ls that normal?
Just use your equalizer.
A little better.
The most toxic creatures on Earth live down here.
The venom of the land animal is nothing by comparison.
Even the weakest sea snake is invariably lethal.
ls that supposed to make me feel good, Beth?
This is our air lock.
lt’ il take us from a wet to a dry environment.
We’ re assuming the inside of the ship is sealed.
This thing is enormous.
That' s not budging, is it?
- Turn it at 45 degrees.
- What’ s happening here?
Is that piston broken?
Can you get the suction cup flat to the plane of the door?
Maybe it’ s the hydraulics.
The pressure messes everything up at this depth.
Time for a demonstration in basic physics, gentlemen.
What is it, Harry?
Take a look.
lt’ s chipped.
So what?
l thought you said this thing wasn’ t damaged when it crashed...... that this titanium alloy was so super- strong, you can’ t hurt it.
I did.
So why does it chip when this scientist just bangs it with a hammer?
ls there heat coming off this thing?
You’ re right.
Get out of there.
Back up.
Just a minute.
I mean, get back now!
Get back.
Jesus.
Anybody else wonder who the hell opened that door?
How did that happen?
l’ m not sure about the atmosphere.
Helmets stay on.
All right.
We come in peace.
Always wanted to say that.
Fletcher, inform the Navy we’ ve gained access...... to the spacecraft.
There' s a hell of a lot of radiation shielding in here.
Huge grids of catwalks and plumbing...
... and a lot of steam.
lt’ s endless.
We’ il stay in touch here.
Somebody’ s been here.
There’ s footsteps and they ain’ t ours.
Time to turn back?
l’ m a little curious.
Break up into 2 squads.
We’ il never cover the territory otherwise.
Split up?
He’ s got a point.
We’ ve only got about a half- hour of breathing time left.
Ted and Harry, you come with me.
Beth, Norman, stick together.
Come on.
I think the people who built this place would call that ’ ’ divide and conquer. ’ ’
Whoever built this thing wanted us dead, we’ d be dead already.
These guys offer a federal grant to study the effects of an alien invasion.
I told all this to Harry.
You made up the report?
No, not all of it.
I mean, I did research on half of it.
Who did the other half?
I borrowed from, you know, good writers.
lsaac Asimov, Rod Serling....
Rod Serling?
You know?
I show up here, half the Pacific fleet is here.
I just didn’ t know what to do.
I wanted to tell you, that’ s all.
ls this in the same category as, ’ ’ Beth, I thought you knew I was married ’ ’?
I don’ t think we have enough oxygen --
- Oh, my God.
- Did you push something?
No.
It did it on its own.
That must be the cockpit.
Hold on.
Look at this.
Cross- stress bracing on the outer hulls.
Look at this stuff.
This is interesting.
Soft and strong at the same time.
lt’ s, like, better than rubber, better than steel.
You know a lot about this stuff.
I studied aeronautical engineering at M. l. T.
lsn’ t that where you got your Ph. D.?
lt’ s where I got mine.
All 3 of them.
I hated M. l. T.
Envy?
Puberty.
How old?
First Ph. D., 18.
Damn.
You beat me by one year.
Let’ s push on.
Let’ s go.
Man, they didn’ t tell you how heavy these things were out of the water.
Look at this.
Come here.
’ ’ Trash. ’ ’
"Basura."
Trash?
Oh, God.
Jesus!
lt’ s human.
You mean humanoid.
No, Norman, I mean human.
Blunt force trauma.
You can see by the direction that the fracture runs...... that he was hit in the back of the head.
What’ s in his hand?
I don’ t know.
What is it?
’ ’ Smokehouse Almonds ’ ’?
My God, it’ s an American spaceship.
It can’ t be an American spaceship.
There weren’ t even Americans, let alone spaceships.
It can’ t be, but it is.
Let’ s see if there’ s some kind of flight recorder or data computer...... where we can ring up some kind...... of a flight history.
I mean....
Look at this. lt’ s in English.
Come here.
Okay, good.
Right there.
And there.
Look at the dates!
Can’ t be.
Could be.
It could be 2043 or 1643.
I don’ t know which one is weirder.
’ ’ Unknown Entry Event. ’ ’ Press it.
You sure?
This is Barnes, Norman.
Yeah, I can hear you.
I can’ t explain it, but I think we’ re inside an American spaceship.
It gets better.
What the hell is it?
Whatever it is, it seems to be what this bird was designed to do.
Go out into space and gather things like this up and bring it back.
Yeah, but back from where?
Don’ t get too excited, Ted.
Turn this thing over, it’ il probably say ’ ’ Made in Korea. ’ ’
Somehow I doubt that.
No doors.
No hinges of any kind.
l’ il bet if you put a laser micrometer on this, it’ d be a perfect sphere.
Perfect to a thousandth of an inch.
That’ s a message in and of itself.
- Really?
- What do you mean?
When Pope Benedict asked Giotto to prove his worth as an artist...... Giotto drew a perfect circle...... freehand.
lt’ s a powerful message.
- I know what the Zen masters would say.
- What’ s that?
’ ’ This ball wants to be caught. ’ ’
Nobody built this thing looking into their third eye.
They went to a lot of trouble and they didn’ t do it for nothing.
Something put this thing out there to get picked up and brought back here.
Have you forgotten the Trojan horse?
It could be a trap.
Don’ t you think that’ s a little paranoid?
No, l’ m going to put a video camera on this thing and keep an eye on it.
Can I ask you something about this reflective surface?
Yeah, it appears to be mercury, doesn’ t it?
Except mercury’ s liquid at this temperature.
That’ s not what l’ m talking about.
What worries me is that it’ s reflecting everything but us.
I hate to be the one non- scientist that picks this up, guys.
You know what I mean?
What do you think it is?
I don’ t know.
Whatever it is...
... it’ s alien.
Okay, an American spacecraft, materials, technology...... more advanced than what we know, crashes into the ocean.
Why wasn’ t it damaged?
The materials are obviously super- strong.
lf that’ s true, why did it chip when you hit it?
Better:
It didn’ t crash.
It arrived...... 300 years ago.
- From where?
- Not ’ ’ where. ’ ’ When.
So you’ re saying this thing took a wrong turn?
That’ s right.
I mean, what if the craft...... inadvertently flew into a black hole?
It arrived in our past from its present.
The dates in the flight record -- 43, 47.
That has to be 2043, 2047.
The image you saw, what you described...... sounds like a black hole, a tear in the space --
We know what a black hole is.
I don’ t know.
lt’ s a collapsed star with so much gravity it’ s like a vacuum cleaner...... sucking everything into it, light, interstellar dust, time --
- Time?
- lt’ s possible, but not plausible.
lt’ s more than probable.
lt’ s rudimentary astrophysics.
We just haven’ t been able to fly into one and prove it.
I just got off the horn topside.
They’ re expecting a bad blow up there.
And they’ re pulling us out.
Pulling us out?
Wait a minute!
What do you mean?
What part of ’ ’ pull out ’ ’ don’ t you understand?
Extraction.
We’ re leaving.
That’ s ridiculous.
We haven’ t even begun to scratch the surface here.
lf you’ ve ever seen a Pacific cyclone, what we call a tornado is a little fart.
So I suggest you go back to the dormitory and take a nap.
You need to lower your metabolism before we start the decompression.
You’ re leaving a time- traveling spacecraft at the bottom of the ocean?
l’ m just following my orders.
But, no aliens.
- It was made in America.
- What’ s your point?
My point is, l’ m a biochemist and there’ s no life down here.
What is wrong with you?!
That doesn’ t mean there’ s nothing to learn, to explore!
She’ s right.
You guys are the human contact team for an Unknown Life Form.
There is no Unknown Life Form, so we pull out at 0900.
- Please say something to him.
- What?
I don’ t know.
Do you not have an opinion about this?
l’ m delighted we’ re going back up top.
You know what I mean?
Let’ s go home.
Barnes is wrong, you know.
You mean, wrong about the storm?
No, about the Sphere.
What about the Sphere?
lt’ s alive.
Why do you say that?
There’ s something inside it.
How can there be anything inside it?
There’ s no door, no seams.
The Sphere chooses what it will and won’ t reflect.
Doesn’ t that seem like the actions of a conscious being to you?
Pop psychology.
I think, for whatever it’ s worth, you’ re angry...... towards our friend Ted in there...... because he figured this out before you did.
You really think so?
I don’ t know.
This is my first underwater session.
You’ re right.
Ted did figure it out first, didn’ t he?
Good shrinkage.
We’ re all going to die down here, you know.
What?
What?
You see, it’ s curious.
Ted did figure it out.
Time travel.
And when we get back, we’ re going to tell everyone...... how it’ s possible, how it’ s done, what the dangers are.
But why 50 years in the future, when the spacecraft encounters a black hole...... does the computer call it an ’ ’ Unknown Entry Event ’ ’?
Why don’ t they know?
lf they don’ t know...... it means we never told anyone.
And if we never told anyone...... it means we never made it back.
Hence...... we die down here.
Just as a matter of deductive logic, Norman.
Damn, I wish I could get inside that Sphere.
- Talk to Mr. Barnes.
- Where is he?
- Video feed room.
I don’ t know where the hell anything is.
Where am l?
Where?
What’ s going on?
You tell me.
- What the hell is he doing?
- I don’ t know.
Do you know what he’ s doing?
- I need to know what you know.
- Nothing.
He wanted to go inside.
We are inside.
You mean outside?
- He said, ’ ’ inside. ’ ’ - What? lnside the spacecraft?
I think inside the Sphere.
Holy shit!
My God.
Did he go inside?
- I don’ t think so.
- What the hell’ s going on?
He didn’ t just disappear.
I think it’ s a glitch in the video.
Give me playback on that.
You’ il have it in a minute.
You knew he was doing this and you said nothing.
- I didn’ t think it possible.
Where are Beth and Ted?
I don’ t know.
I woke up, I heard bells ringing and I started running --
I' m not getting an image on the sub.
Impossible!
I got a cable in my quarters!
They’ il be here in 25 minutes or less!
The only logical explanation is that the sub is still at the surface.
ls it also logically possible your sonar is messed up?!
Let’ s just calm down, all right?
He didn’ t just disappear.
We are not going to leave him.
You got that right.
I am not going to lose a civilian on my watch.
You have just screwed up our trip to the surface.
We are not going up to the surface.
Harry!
We are not going up!
Harry!
Can you hear me?
Harry, can you hear me?
Norman, this is not a triage situation.
Go find me Ted and Beth.
Norman, stop.
Still no reading on the sub.
Forget the goddamn sonar, Teeny.
All right?
What the hell?
Can you hear me?
ls he alive?
We have a problem.
Harry’ s out cold.
His pulse is normal.
All his vitals are normal...... but I don’ t get it.
Hello!
Norman, can you hear me?
We lost video here.
Can you hear me?
- That tears it.
- What, sir?
We’ re on internal power.
I don 't follow you.
They cut us loose, Teeny.
For some reason the sub turned back.
Break out your 5- day deodorant pads.
We' re here for the duration.
Everything’ s normal.
What’ s going on?
ls he all right?
Did he go inside?
What did he say?
He didn’ t say.
He’ s aphasic.
He’ s asleep, Ted.
I can’ t believe he went inside.
He didn’ t say anything?
There’ s no door, no entry.
How did he get in?
Can I have your attention, please?
We' ve lost contact with the surface.
The Habitat is now operating solely under internal power.
We have plenty of food, oxygen and fresh water...... to sustain us until the storm is over...... and we reestablish contact with the surface.
But until that time, this mission is subject...... to emergency authority under my command.
l’ m taking this out to the mini- sub.
- Are you up on the duty roster?
- Yes, sir.
Where’ s she going?
lt’ s procedures.
Everything in the Habitat is videoed.
Every 1 2 hours we take the videos to the mini- sub and press the reset button.
The idea is, if something happens to us and we don’ t reset it...... the sub goes to the surface automatically.
lf we’ re all dead, they at least have a partial record of what went wrong.
Cheerful thought, huh?
Mind the store a minute.
l’ m going to the head.
What the hell’ s that?
lt’ s so beautiful down here.
lt’ s so tranquil.
This is beautiful.
lt’ s hard to believe we have a typhoon 1, 000 feet above our heads.
Hey, it' s snowing down here.
You see them?
There' s got to be a million...... jellyfish down here.
Man, this is really beautiful.
These jellyfish are getting a little friendly.
Having a hard time seeing.
Hey, guys, you getting this?
It' s getting thick down here.
Hello, hello.
I can 't see what I' m doing.
They’ re sticking to my faceplate.
Fletcher, this is Dr. Fielding.
Just swim through them.
They’ re harmless.
Guys, these jellyfish are everywhere.
Fletcher, get out of there.
What are jellyfish doing at 1, 000 feet?
I think they feel the heat from my body.
I can’ t get them off me!
They’ re stinging through my suit!
Get back to the Habitat on the double.
I can’ t move my legs!
Come back to the Habitat.
They’ re inside my suit!
Keep moving!
Just keep moving!
Help me!
Jesus, Barnes, she' s dead!
There' s no bubbles.
Edmunds.
Yes, sir?
Come on down here.
Something...... happened to Fletcher.
God!
When I was 5 years old I went out on a boat with my father.
He told me not to jump in the water, so of course I did and....
Oh, my!
I jumped right into a school of these guys.
Not this big, though.
l think every one had a shot at me.
I don’ t know what this lady felt...... but, man, it went beyond pain.
l’ ve been...
... afraid of them since.
Would you feel any better if I told you this wasn’ t exactly a jellyfish?
You mean...?
I mean, jellyfish like this are unheard of.
I don’ t know what this is, but it isn’ t God’ s creation.
Here I am Your special island
Come to me
Bali Ha 'i
You can come in.
Have a seat.
You want some coffee?
- No, thanks.
- How well do you know Dr. Halperin?
I used to teach at UC San Diego years ago.
She came for her master’ s.
Don’ t take it personally, but I assume she wasn’ t a romantic interest.
Don’ t take what personally?
She’ s a tall, vibrant, younger woman.
What’ s your point?
You knew her as a patient.
l’ m not at liberty to discuss that.
You understand.
I understand an exotic- gas environment 1, 000 feet under water...... with no lifeline to the surface...... is about the most dangerous environment on the planet.
lf there’ s a problem, I got to know about it.
- Beth is fine. - ’ ’ Beth is fine. ’ ’
- Beth’ s fine.
- She’ s very fine.
Would you like to read this and tell me what it says?
- Are these my actual notes?
- What does it say?
- How in the world did you get -- - Does it say ’ ’ suicide attempt ’ ’? ’ ’ Electroshock therapy ’ ’?
lsn’ t that what it says?
What’ s your point?
Didn’ t it seem important enough to tell somebody?
You were willing to jeopardize these people’ s lives...... to have someone here who could be mentally unstable?
Are you aware of the term, ’ ’ overreact ’ ’?
We’ re 160 fathoms down.
And we’ ve got a nutbag down here who can flip out and crack up.
You selected the team.
Why didn’ t you tell me?
When I wrote this, I didn’ t know the team would be 1, 000 -- 1, 000 or 10, it makes no difference!
Why didn’ t you tell me about Beth?
It wasn’ t pertinent.
That was not your call to make!
Yes, it was and it still is.
It was a passive attempt.
A passive attempt?!
Those who really want to kill themselves shoot themselves or go over a bridge.
They don’ t call their boyfriend and say, ’ ’ I just took 20 Nebutol.
Help me. ’ ’
She took 20 yellows, and you’ re telling me she’ s perfect.
What is it?
Come in.
lt’ s Harry.
What?
He’ s awake?
He’ s really awake.
Man, oh, man!
You’ re going to have a problem with me.
lf my good buddy Norman keeps cooking like this, I ain’ t going nowhere.
This toast is good.
Better.
But these eggs!
These eggs are fantastic!
Norman, what did you put in these eggs?
No, no, wait.
Don’ t tell me.
Parsley.
Chives.
Tarragon and....
What is that?
Chervil?
ls that chervil?
Yes, it is.
l’ m glad you like it, Harry.
I love eggs!
They sure seem to cheer you up.
Do you remember what happened?
Yeah.
I went inside.
How did you get inside?
There are no doors.
There are doors all over this place and we can’ t get out.
- We’ re still here.
- Yes, we are.
You didn’ t answer my question.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Harry, are you saying we shouldn’ t still be here?
Where’ s Teeny?
I thought she did all the cooking.
She had an unfortunate accident, Harry.
She was killed.
Killed?
How?
Jellyfish.
Jellyfish?
That’ s strange.
Yes, it is strange, isn’ t it?
Here you go, Harry.
- Little onion rings.
Look at that.
- lt’ s not onion rings.
Good, though.
Guess what it is.
Calamari!
You all right?
Cough, cough, cough.
- No, you’ re doing it wrong.
- I know what l’ m doing.
Bring it up.
Come on, bring it up.
He’ s trying to say something.
He’ s trying to talk.
You don’ t listen.
He wants to say something!
- l’ m not choking, you asshole!
- See?
I hate squid.
I hate squid.
l’ m sorry.
I was trying to help.
You okay?
Harry, let me ask you something.
Before you went in the Sphere, you were convinced we would die here.
Yeah, I remember that.
You still believe it?
You afraid of dying, Norman?
Bullshit!
He’ s hiding something and you know it.
He went inside the Sphere and whatever it is he saw, he won’ t tell us.
- He said he doesn’ t remember anything.
- You bought that?
The whole food thing was all a diversion.
The guy’ s willing to put all of our lives on the line...... because he doesn’ t want to share information.
I can see it.
He’ s making notes for a book.
He wants to win the Nobel Prize.
And you don’ t?
Norman, you’ ve known me since I was 17 years old.
I would love to be the guy who gets --
Do you know how respected --
l’ m not! l’ ve written one ’ ’ Fun With Dick and Jane ’ ’ book on physics.
I mean, Niels Bohr...... he published ’ ’ The Quantum Theory of Atomic Structure ’ ’ at 28.
Newton, gravity, 23.
ln physics, if you haven’ t done it by 35, chances are you never will.
This doesn’ t have anything to do with your competitiveness with Harry?
Wunderkind!
I rest my case.
Mr. Barnes would like to see you.
Why?
Something’ s wrong with the computer system.
- I tried.
It just keeps coming back.
Discharge from the buffer memory?
I ruled that out.
The helium is getting to the chips.
lt’ s probably a saturation effect.
- lf that’ s true, what are our options?
- You have to change all the chips.
Run this place on manual?
lt’ s going to be a long 4 days.
Hey, boss.
- Figured that out yet?
- lt’ s a saturation effect.
I don’ t think so. lf it’ s a saturation effect, it would be random.
What do you mean?
This has a pattern.
See? lt’ s like a code.
A code from where?
How’ d you do that?
How’ d you see that?
Try binary.
See?
Letter breaks.
You think this is coming from the Sphere?
Don’ t know.
This mission is ultra top- secret.
What you translate is for my eyes only.
lf you were it, how would you know our alphabet?
Same way it’ s configured on a keyboard.
But reflected in an orb, spherically.
A keyboard, but spherical.
Take a keyboard...... wrap it around a sphere...... then starting at the center key, G, number the letters...... spiraling out.
- You the man!
- I still got it.
I still got the juice.
Keyboard.
They let you keep those?
Here, you want them?
All we got to do now is plug in the numbers.
Friends...... in the 8, 000 years of recorded history, this is a first.
You’ re now on- line with an alien intelligence.
You got to be kidding.
You must’ ve messed up the translation.
I don’ t think so.
lf this is right, this alien sounds like an idiot.
That’ s something to consider.
They must have them.
I will admit the message is childlike, but actually it’ s quite perfect.
lt’ s short, to the point, non- threatening...... kind of the way you talk to a small child or a dog.
Look at this.
He’ s making a speech.
Ask him for his last name.
What?
I want a full name for my report.
l’ m not putting in my report I lost a crew member on a deepsat expedition...... to find an alien named Jerry.
Please! ’ ’ Jerry ’ ’?
We ought to tell him that we’ re enjoying it too.
Ask him where he’ s from.
Where are you from?
’ ’ I make a journey.
You make a journey.
We make a journey together. ’ ’
I think Jerry’ s channeling Deepak Chopra.
A journey from where?
He’ s happy.
He’ s crafty.
What happened?
Damn, I think we lost him.
We’ re not alone.
We are definitely...... not alone.
lt’ s trying to make contact with us.
Whatever it is, it was inside that Sphere.
Now it’ s out, free to act.
What do you mean by that?
Free to take over our computers...... call us on the phone, come knock on the door if it wants to.
A physical presence.
What are you thinking about?
That last part where he said, ’ ’ I am happy. ’ ’
Don’ t you want Jerry to be happy?
Honestly?
What’ s on your mind?
I would be happy if Jerry had no emotions whatsoever.
Because the thing of it is, here’ s Jerry...... an emotional being, cooped up for 300 years with no one to talk to...... none of the socialization, the emotional growth...... that comes from contact with other emotional beings....
So?
What happens if Jerry gets mad?
What is that sound?
Did you hear it?
You hear that thump?
What is that sound?
Can you hear me?
Did you hear that thump?
You are a hell of a woman.
I wish I knew you in the old days.
Norman told me you were --
Norman told you what?
Let’ s put it this way, that if Jerry could read your mind...... he’ d be bored with ours.
What is that sound?
Can you hear me?
This is Norman.
I get no answer from Edmunds and there’ s strange noises.
Something’ s going on.
It looks like Edmunds is up on the side of the Habitat.
I' m not getting anything on sonar, but watch yourselves out there.
Would you hit your callback buttons, please?
What’ d you tell Barnes?
About what?
About me.
You told him I took 20 Nebutol and tried to kill myself.
Didn’ t you?
What do you want me to do?
Did you tell him who I called?
Oh, God.
Come in.
Did you guys find that thumping yet?
[Bell Ringing]
Aren' t you forgetting something?
I know.
It' s something to do with the third differential coefficient.
- Not that, Tonight, - What?
Emma?
- What time is it?
- Almost 5: 00,
Oh, God.
My proposal for utilizing solar power, rejected,
My concepts for harnessing micro- energy waves, rejected,
The dean suggests that I focus on something that might actually help mankind,
Like his study on the benefits of tobacco consumption, [Man # 2]
The problem is with the faculty.
They' re dinosaurs.
They' re already extinct; they just don' t know it.
They' il be discovered by some future archaeologist, and he won' t know what to make of them.
Their dim little eyes, devoid of any curiosity --
Alex, it' s your first year as associate professor.
You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
You sound just like my father.
Look at them, Philby.
All alike.
All in identical bowler hats.
Do you want your students to turn out like that?
I want my students to be prepared for the realities of the world they' re about to greet.
Well, I don' t.
I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
Mrs. Watchit!
Oh, huzzah, the master' s home.
- Did you get it?
- Hello, Mr. Philby.
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.
You' re looking in the pink.
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lad.
- Don' t torture me.
Did you get it?
- I got it.
Let me see.
- But don' t you think for one moment...
I' m going to let you go out in that filthy jacket.
Now, go in there and change.
And you' ve got another letter from that annoying little man.
Well, go ahead, switch it on,
- It' il help people keep their teeth well into their 40s,
- You might think about having that cleaned.
- Oh, who has the time?
- How did you know with Molly?
- Know what?
- You were meant to be together.
- She made the best shepherd' s pie I ever tasted.
Don' t you have a single romantic bone in your body?
No.
I' m all bowler hat.
Why do you waste your time on that crackpot?
Because he has some very interesting ideas.
A professor at Columbia University should not be corresponding with a crazy German bookkeeper.
He' s a patent clerk, not a bookkeeper.
I think Mr. Einstein deserves all the support I can give him.
I wonder if we' il ever go too far?
- With what?
- With this.
With all of this.
No such thing.
All right.
How do I look?
Practically decent.
Really, Alex.
Good luck tonight.
She' s a fine girl.
She' s done wonderful things for you.
Don' t worry.
You still have that alluring smell of chalk.
Oh, gotta hurry.
Now, that' s more like it.
You look a proper gentleman for once.
If Emma turns me down, you' il be next.
- [Clears Throat]
All right.
Wish me luck.
Thank you.
Fresh flowers.
Fresh flowers.
- Have some flowers, sir.
- Not tonight, thanks.
No.
I promised her flowers.
Spectacular.
Spectacular waste of money.
Damn thing' s always breaking down.
Do you need a lift?
- Yes, yes.
- How do you keep the water temperature stable?
- on the fuel regulator -- - [Revs]
Uh -- [Blows Raspberry]
Much obliged.
I' m always forgetting the damn brake.
Hop in.
I' il give you a perambulation before it breaks down again.
Oh, uh, I' m afraid I have a prior engagement.
Well, another time then.
We perambulate here most every night.
Certainly.
Get a horse!
Yes.
Alexander?
Whoa.
- [Laughing]
- You' re late, Professor.
- I got here as soon as I could.
Well, they say it' s all the rage in Paris.
But I just picked it up --
- Five dollars at Macy' s.
Silly, isn' t it?
- Very silly.
I like it.
Well, where are they?
- What?
- The flowers.
You promised me flowers tonight.
Don' t you even remember?
Oh, I' m sorry.
I -- Well, I was distracted.
Well, there' s something new.
- [Chuckling]
- Oh, uh, shall we walk through the park?
- Yes.
Professor, you' re shivering.
I hope you' re not coming down with something.
Well, I' m afraid I am.
I' m not sleeping very well, and even when I' m awake, I' m not much use.
I can' t eat or think or do much of anything anymore.
And the worst part is, I don' t know that I' il ever be well.
- [Gasps]
Oh, Emma, I know it' s right.
I know we' re meant to be together.
It' s the only thing in my entire life I' ve never had to think about.
Oh, Alex.
Uh- Uh, wait.
I have something for you.
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
I- I know.
Oh.
- I know it' s not a diamond.
- A moonstone.
Well, it' s your birthstone.
I thought --
You thought right.
I just might cry,
I couldn' t help but overhear.
Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.
- I wish you the very best.
- Well, thank you.
- And as much as I hate to do this -- moved as I am by your... protestations of love --
I' il be needing your money now.
- Sir?
- And your jewelry too.
I guess we could call this your first little bump on the road to marital bliss.
- I don' t understand -- - Don' t make a scene.
There' s no cause for that.
- Just give me your wallet, will you?
- Hmm?
Did you hear me, lad?
Here.
That' s everything.
And your watch.
And the gloves.
- And the ring.
- No.
I' m afraid so, darling.
- And maybe he' il buy you a diamond now.
- Please, please.
Not that.
[Crying]
Why did you do that?
It' s only a ring.
Emma?
Emma?
[Sobbing]
- What?
Oh.
Oh, sir, Mr. Philby' s here.
- Here?
- Yes, sir, He insisted on coming --
- Tell him to go away, I' m busy, - I won' t go away, Alex.
My God.
What' s happened to you?
I' ve been -- I' ve been working.
You remember that?
You used to care about your work.
I care more about my life.
And yours.
I came by the house every day after the funeral... and every week and every other month.
Then I stopped coming.
Did you even notice?
- It hurt me, Alex... very much.
- Then why are you here now?
I know.
You' re concerned.
I know.
I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
But really...
I need you to go.
- I won' t leave.
Not with you hiding down here.
- I' m not hiding.
You know that' s what it is.
Mrs. Watchit says you' re in here all hours -- day and night.
Alex, will you please stand still and look at me!
It wasn' t your fault.
No.
It wasn' t my fault.
Maybe we should blame Mrs. Watchit for picking up the ring from the jeweler.
Or the jeweler for making it.
Or the poor bastard who tore the stone from the earth.
Yes.
Alexander, nothing will ever change what happened.
No, you' re wrong, because I will change it.
David, I appreciate your concern.
I do.
But I ask you to have faith in me.
Well, I- I want to have faith in you, Alex, but --
Wha -- What are -- What are you doing here?
I' il tell you what.
Why don' t you come by for dinner in a week, and I' il show you?
- Why don' t you come home with me now?
Molly -- - Did you not hear me, David?
I can' t leave when I' m so close.
All right.
We' il continue this conversation in a week.
In a week, we' il never even have had this conversation.
Thank you, my good man.
You' re early.
That' s a first.
I wanted to see you.
Well, where are they?
- What?
- The flowers.
You promised me flowers tonight.
Don' t you even remember?
You never cease to surprise me.
Emma, I need to talk to you.
- Shall we walk through the park?
- No!
No,
No.
Let' s go into the city.
- Alex, what is it?
- Nothing.
Let' s just hurry.
Running along is all very well for you.
You' re not wearing a corset.
- [Horse Whinnies]
Now you' re all gallant.
Professor, you' re shivering.
I hope you' re not coming down with something.
No, no.
I' m fine.
I' m wonderful.
I' m walking down the street with you again.
But we took a walk three days ago.
Well, not like this.
Never like this.
- Heavens, look at that car.
- Oh, I' ve seen it.
Now I know you' re ill.
You' re passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
- It' s only a machine.
- Alexander, tell me what' s going on.
- Is something wrong?
- No.
No.
Emma, listen to me.
I need to leave you now, but I want you to go straight home and stay there.
I' il be all upset that you didn' t meet me in the park, but you must trust me.
Everything will be all right.
Just know how much I love you, how much I' il always love you.
[Clears Throat]
But first, where are my flowers?
- [Giggles]
Wait right there.
Don' t move.
- Oh, can I help you, sir?
- Yes, a dozen roses.
White.
- No, no.
- [Man]
Look out!
- [Both Grunting]
I' m looking for Professor Hartdegen.
Alex, I' m -- I' m so sorry.
- This was not supposed to happen.
- Of course not.
- I know there' s nothing I can say.
- We were out of the park, Philby.
We were safe.
Why can' t I change it?
I could come back a thousand times.
See her die a thousand ways.
I don' t -- I don' t understand.
I can' t find the answer here.
Not here.
Not now.
The future is now.

All right, attention, everyone,
Class 23, could we gather, please?
Our next stop is Antiquities.

Welcome to Vox System.
How may I help you?
I didn' t see you there.
I always seem to have that effect.
How may I help you, sir?
- What is that thing?
- That is my photonic memory core, or P. M. C., as we say in the trade.
Over here, sir.
What are you?
I' m the Fifth Avenue Public Library information unit, Vox registration NY- 114.
How may I help you?
- A stereopticon of some sort.
- Stereopticon?
Oh, no, sir,
I am a third- generation, fusion- powered photonic, with verbal and visual link capabilities connected to every database... on the planet,
Photonic?
A compendium of all human knowledge.
- Oh.
- Area of inquiry?
- Do you know anything about physics?
- Ah, accessing physics.
Mechanical engineering.
Dimensional optics.
Chronography.
Temporal causality, temporal paradox.
- Time travel?
- Yes.
Accessing science fiction.
No, no.
Practical application.
My question is why can' t one change the past?
Because one cannot travel into the past.
- Wh- What if one could?
- One cannot.
Excuse me, this is something you should trust me on.
Accessing the writings of Isaac Asimov, H. G. Wells,
Harlan Ellison, Alexander Hartdegen --
- Tell me about him.
- Alexander Hartdegen, 1869 to 1903,
American scientist given to eccentric postulation.
Found writings include treatise on the creation of a time machine.
- Tell me about the time machine.
- Time Machine was written by H. G. Wells in 1894.
It was later adapted to a motion picture by George Pal and a stage musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber --
- That' s not what I mean.
- Would you like to hear selections from the score?
- No. - # There' s a place called tomorrow #
# A place of joy not of sorrow #
# Can' t you see it' s a place for you and -- #
Thank you.
That' s quite enough.
Will there be anything else?
Uh, no.
No, I think I' il have better luck in a few hundred years.
Live long and prosper.
Sir, where is your designated evacuation center?
Sir, you are subject to arrest under martial law -- [Man # 1]
Please put your hands out, palms together.
You will be held in detention until your evacuation center clears you for transport.
Wait, wait!
- Just take it easy.
- Hey, we got to get out of here!
- Wait.
How did this happen?
The moon.
Come on.
Move it.
That' s impossible.
What happened?
- You been living under a rock?
Yes, I' ve been living under a rock.
Now, tell me.
The demolitions for the lunar colonies screwed up the orbit, okay?
The moon' s breaking up.
All right?
Come on.
- Hey!
Come on!
- [Explosion]
Emma?
Shh!
Hello?
Hello.
- [Speaking Foreign Language]
Oh, wait.
Don' t -- Don' t go.
I just want to talk to you.
- [Foreign Language]
Oh, I' m sorry.
I don' t understand you.
- Do you know my words?
- Yes.
The lex.
The stone language.
The stone language?
But do you understand me?
Do you understand me?
We all learn it when we' re young,
They tor' jen.
Forget.
They forget it.
- But I teach, - [Foreign Language]
- What is he saying?
- They' re trying to decide if we should throw you in the river.
Tell me quickly, and tell me the truth.
Where do you come from?
Well, actually, I' m from here.
Uh, just not from now.
You see, I built a machine that allows me to travel through time.
I' m from the past.
Oh.
I told them you hit your head... and you are a wandering idiot.
- What are you doing?
- Getting ready for the mor,
- Oh.
I' il come with you.
Eloi?
What are your people named?
Well, I- I guess you' d call us New Yorkers.
New Yorkers.
Are they friendly?
[Chuckles]
- Tell me about your village.
- It' s a very busy place.
Everyone seems to be in a hurry.
And they all wear identical bowler hats.
Little black round things on their heads.
- What do you do there?
- Well, I was a teacher like Mara.
- And I make things, - [Boy]
Me also,
I made a sess' quin' tan with my father.
We still use it.
A sess' quin' tan?
Mara, der' enjen' wenlen?
Sess' quin' tan.
Steps of rope.
Oh, a rope ladder.
We can make one.
I will teach you.
Will you tell me more lon' el on the next day?
Tomorrow?
Yes, I will.
Why don' t you take care of this for me tonight?
- Thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Kalen will tire you if you let him.
He' s always been questioning.
Our parents were firm, but it is his way.
- Where are your parents?
- They' ve gone from this place.
Oh, I' m sorry.
[Alex Thinking]
I did go too far.
Sit with me.
Mara, why do you pull the boats up at night?
Afraid they' il be stolen?
Stolen?
I do not know that word.
Well, are you afraid that someone will take them?
- It is just more safe this way.
- Oh.
- You must do things to be safe where you come from?
- Of course,
Or when you come from.
Ah, so I' m not just a wandering idiot.
Col' mar,
Maybe we could find some tomorrow.
Flowers?
Alexander, Alexander,
[Kalen]
Morlock!
- Is he all right?
- He had a dream.
Oh.
So did I.
I was moving through a jungle --
And you saw a shape ahead of you.
Well, a face that... called my name.
We all have that dream.
- All of you?
- Yes.
Now go back asleep.
You' re still not well,
What does that mean, "Morlock"?
A child' s dream.
No more.
Go back asleep,
We keep these stones In many places,
This is the room where my parents taught me for the first time.
Why do you learn this language if you don' t use it?
It' s a tradition we hand down.
It meant something once.
Must be here for a reason.
"One generation passeth away, and another cometh.
But the earth abideth forever. "
Why have you come here?
Why have you traveled through time?
To have a question answered.
Question?
Yes.
Why can' t I change the past?
Why would you want to?
You' ve lost someone.
Some one you loved very much.
- Mara, why are there no older people here?
- What do you mean?
Older people, your parents' age or grandparents' age.
They' ve gone from this place.
You mean, they' re dead?
Yes.
All of them?
How is that possible?
There are things better left not said.
We don' t dwell on the past, Alexander.
We do something else.
- What?
We remember them... with these,
Alexander!
Alexander.
- Are you coming to work now?
Come with me -- - [Mara]
No.
Alexander' s not well enough.
We' re going to see his machine.
- Now?
[Continues In Eloi]
- Go the next day, tomorrow.
- I need to see that it' s all right.
- [Child Laughing]
Will you tell me more about N- New York tonight?
I will.
Oh, good.
It seems fine.
We had quite a ride together.
- It' s ready?
- Appears so.
Will you use it now?
Go back to your own time?
Well, I -- I guess I could.
Uh... it seems so long ago.
No.
You should go.
Will you take Kalen with you?
- Why?
- Alexander, take him away, back to your time.
Will you?
- Mara, why?
- Please.
You don' t know.
- [Horn Blowing, Man Shouting]
Kalen!
Mara, what' s going on?
They' re early!
We must get Kalen!
Kalen!
Kalen!
Kalen!
Mara!
- [Mara]
- No, stay here.
Stay in the group!
Run!
Mara!
Mara!
Where did they take them?
- We have to follow them.
We have to find them.
- We do not.
Col' quin tor,
- Why not?
- This is nem Eloi' tas, our life here.
- How can you just do nothing?
- How can tor' tasal' mor,
- It is the day and the night.
- The day and the night.
- This is the world.
- [Eloi]
Fight back.
Why not?
Those who farquil' pax... fight -- are taken first.
- Kalen, do you know where they' re taken?
- No.
- Do they ever come back?
- No.
- Has anyone ever followed them?
- I don' t know.
There must be a leader.
- We' re not supposed to talk.
Kalen, listen to me.
Listen.
Sometimes we need to accept what' s happening to us even if we don' t want to.
And other times we have to fight, even if we' re afraid.
Now, it' s difficult to understand, I know.
Believe me, I know.
Now, they' re afraid, and I' m asking you not to be.
So will you tell me what you know?
We can save her.
Please.
When they go, we' re not supposed to talk about it.
- But we all know the place.
- What place?
Where the ghosts are.
Here it is.
Welcome to VOX system.
How may I help you?
- It' s all right.
How may I serve you?
What can I get you?
Oh, let' s see.
Um, Henry James.
Yes?
No, no, no, Too depressing, Hemingway, perhaps?
No, Too sweaty,
Plato, Proust, Pinter, Poe, Pound?
No.
Complete Works Of Martha Stewart?
Ah, I have it!
Jules Verne.
- Right up your alley, I would think.
- Photonic, right?
Or what' s left of one.
What' s left of all of them.
I am the last, and "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."
T. S. Eliot.
You wouldn' t know him yet, but he is so depressing, yet so divine.
Oh, I' m sorry.
The lending library is temporarily out of service.
Not to worry.
I have them all right here -- every page of every volume.
Can you tell me what' s happening here?
Well, my sources are no longer fully annotated, and my information is somewhat anecdotal, but I believe what was once one race... is now two.
One above and one below.
Two distinct species that have evolved.
- And how do those below survive?
- That is the real question, isn' t it?
- I don' t believe it.
- Well, if you don' t like the answers, you should avoid asking the questions.
Look at them.
They have no knowledge of the past, no ambition for the future,
- So lucky, - Why would you say something like that?
Can you even imagine what it' s like to remember everything?
I remember a six- year- old girl who asked me about dinosaurs 800, 000 years ago.
Look Homeward, Angel, by Thomas Wolfe.
And yes, I even remember you,
Time travel: practical application.
How do you know about the Morlocks if you can' t leave this place?
There was one Eloi who managed to escape, He told me everything,
We spent years together, just talking.
The conversation' s a little spotty now, but I do remember.
- It' s good to have a friend.
- Then you can help us find the Morlocks, find Mara.
And if the truth is so horrible, and will haunt your dreams for all time?
Well, I think I' m used to that.
My friend said he came from the east, from the jungle.
- Will you describe it?
- I don' t have to.
Just follow the breathing.
In the dream, we' re moving toward it, but I think it was meant to keep us away.
- I might just go in by myself.
- No.
Mara would be very cross with me if you got hurt.
Now, I' il find her, but I need you to go back to the village and light a fire so we can find our way home.
- All right?
Will you do that for me?
- I lost your pocket watch.
They took it from my room.
I' m sorry.
Why would they take it?
Oh.
Stupid.
Mara?
Mara?
Mara.
Mara?
Come a little closer.
I don' t bite.
Do I surprise you?
- A little.
Yes.
- Hmm.
We weren' t always like this.
After the moon fell from the sky, the Earth could no longer sustain the species.
The rest of us escaped underground,
Then centuries later, when we tried to re- emerge into the sun again, we couldn' t,
So we bred ourselves into castes.
Some to be our eyes and ears.
- Some to be our muscles and sinews.
- You mean, your hunters.
Yes.
Bred to be predators, but bred also to be controlled.
You see, my caste concentrated... on expanding our cerebral abilities.
- You control their thoughts.
- Not just theirs.
The Eloi.
So it' s not enough that you hunt them down like animals.
- That' s their role here.
- To be your food?
Yes.
And for those who are suitable, to be breeding vessels... for our other colonies.
You see, I' m just one of many,
I don' t understand how you can sit there and speak so coldly about this.
Have you not considered the human cost of- of what it is you' re doing?
We all pay a price...
Alexander.
Don' t worry.
You' re safe.
I control them.
Without that control, they would exhaust the food supply... in a matter of months.
Food supply?
They' re human beings!
Who are you... to question 800, 000 years...
of evolution?
- [Growling]
And what is time travel but your pathetic attempt to control the world around you, your futile effort to have a question answered?
Do you think I don' t know you, Alexander?
I can look inside your memories, your nightmares, your dreams.
You' re a man haunted by those two most terrible words:
What if?
Look at you!
And a long ponytail -- - Daddy!
- Daddy!
- [Girl]
Long ponytail, [Girl]
Daddy.
You built your time machine because of Emma' s death.
If she had lived, it would never have existed.
So how could you use your machine to go back to save her?
You are the inescapable result... of your tragedy, just as I... am the inescapable result... of you.
You have your answer.
Now go.
I believe you have something that belongs to me.
- We all have our time machines, don' t we?
Those that take us back are memories... and those that carry us forward... are dreams.
- You' re forgetting one thing.
- Huh?
- [Gasping]
- What are you doing with it?
- Changing the future.
Come on.
Wait.
Wait here.
Go.
- [Grunting]
Huh?
Alexander!
I' m sorry you lost your machine.
Oh, it' s all right.
It was only a machine.
"while the three dead boys came marching up the aisle...
- "sneaking sheepishly in the rear.
"They had hid in an unused gallery, listening to their own funeral sermon.
Aunt Polly, Mary and the Harpers threw themselves upon them -- "
This is the place.
So it is.
- But there' s nothing here.
- Well, it was different then.
My laboratory was all around here.
The kitchen was up there where that tree is.
Not that Mrs. Watchit ever let me go in there.
I don' t know what to tell you, sir.
He' s been gone this whole week.
And you' ve no idea where he went?
- [Alexander]
This would be my greenhouse,
There was a garden outside.
Gren 'tormar' tas?
Yes.
- I' m glad.
- Sir?
I' m glad he' s gone.
Maybe he' s finally found someplace where he can be happy.
- This was my home.
- His home.
Long ago.
You know, Molly and I were talking about engaging a housekeeper, someone to live with us and help take care of Jamie.
Would you be interested?
- Perhaps just until the master returns.
- Of course.
- But there' d be some changes made.
- [Chuckles]
Oh, I have no doubt of that.
I' il call by in the morning, and we' il arrange it.
- Good night, Mrs. Watchit.
- Good night, Mr. Philby.
- Godspeed, my fine lad.
Godspeed.
MAN:
There wasn' t always a war with the Centauri but in my lifetime, it' s all I' ve ever known.
By the year 2050, six years after the first attack we' d lost so many things.
We' d lost the sky to electromagnetic domes to shield the Earth from frequent air raids increasing in intensity.
We' d lost the uncovered cities that the government forgot.
We' d lost democracy to global leadership.
Their goal was Earth.
The ultimate land war, with no boundaries.
When I was a boy, I built toy rockets.
I wanted to explore space and discover new worlds.
I' ve never seen a Centauri, but I knew what my father told me.
I knew they were an alien race,
They were genetically superior and they came after us with no mercy.
I also knew they were the last thing my father saw.
I stopped building rockets.
There was no need for them.
I built weapons instead.
And I know my salvation.
Her name is Maya.
A little hotter.
That' s good.
Music on.
(dance music playing)
Something else.
Hooker, John Lee.
(laughs)
Go, Johnny Lee!
TV on.
Watch the news for me, will you?
News three.
Hoping to catch a glimpse of their beloved leader hundreds of people have thronged the Ballard Space Port as citywide preparations are made for the Chancellor' s arrival...
Spence, it' s on!
Music off.
Water off.... last week' s brutal Centauri attack on the Tolstoy Colony of Asteroid X- 83.
What' d I miss?
Alighting from a recent briefing with high- ranking officials at Sector Eight the Chancellor visits our region for a secret meeting with government scientists.
Some secret.
Tolstoy colony was a bastion of peace and free expression in this grievous time of war.
Why do they leak these things?
They want us to think that she' s Joan of Arc and not some warmonger.
With one deadly strike...
Centauri stormtroopers annihilated this idyilic community.
Well, I hope she likes talking politics.
REPORTER:
Firefighter robots have finally extinguished the blaze which has devastated Sutton Wood.
Over 600 acres of forest were razed and authorities have closed off the area to all hikers and picnickers.
The cause of the fire is unknown but careless campers are most likely to blame.
Morning, Mr. Siegel.
Morning, Spence.
I don' t think they' il get through the dome today.
They can, and they will, sir.
They can and they will.
Come to me.
A mob of raucous anti- war protesters clashed with military troops, leading to 50 arrests.
The protest was dissembled thanks to a swift response by military leaders.
No fatalities were reported, nor were there any...
Veterans Plaza.
Stand clear of the platform.
Morning.
Good morning, Nelson.
I am high- quality.
So tonight' s the big night, huh?
Huge.
Nervous?
- No.
- Liar.
Uh, no.
Don' t overthink it.
I' il give you a tip.
She likes to be called Chancie and when you get right up next to her cup her right buttock in your hand and jiggle it really fast.
(chuckling)
Tight security this morning.
I guess Chancie' s a little paranoid.
So, how' s my favorite girl?
We went camping this weekend up in Sutton Woods.
She loved it.
Lucky you missed the fire.
Who says we missed the fire?
You dog.
Voice print, please.
What?
Voice print, please.
Spencer John Olham
Project Director.
(Spencer' s distorted electronic voice)
Whatever med- specs you give them
I want you to double the dosages on your order estimates.
Yes, doctor.
Yes.
How are we doing on synth plasma?
SR' s still waiting.
Okay, well, I' il just have to contact Central Supply and see if they send some in the next run.
If you want to keep inviting more wounded we' re going to have to move the party to your place.
Ah, Dr. Carone, and I' m barely awake.
Something tells me this is my morning lecture on hospital administration.
Let' s go ahead and keep him on the angiolytic.
Give him another 12 hours.
Rumor has it there' s another evac on its way here from Tolstoy.
I' d like to know why you told them we could handle them.
Did security ask you for a voice print?
No.
Strange.
It' s never done that before.
They' re gearing up for Big Sister.
What do you suggest I do?
We could ask evac to reroute.
Forget it.
I am all for the war effort.
I just care about saving as many women as I possibly can.
COMPUTER:
Good morning, Dr. Olham.
Please enter.
What do you care about?
I want to be in waste management. "
You tell me, should I worry?
Little Joey' s on the slow side, isn' t he.
You know, I pray nights he marries well.
There she is.
Three years of hard labor and you are now the proud father of an 80- ton baby girl.
July 16, 1945 - 5: 29 a. m.
What?
Ah.
Three weeks later the weapon hits ground zero in Hiroshima, Japan wiping out 140, 000 people.
Oppenheimer sees the madness and urges the UN to gain control of thermonuclear development.
Government turns around and calls him a Communist sympathizer.
Let the celebration begin.
And when it was all over
Einstein said
"Only two things are infinite:" the universe and human stupidity and I' m not sure about the universe. "
What' s the matter with you?
Nothing.
I' d say it' s ambivalence.
I don' t have that luxury, myself but then again, I see our people die every day.
Have we met?
This weapon is a godsend.
It will ensure the preservation of our race and our faith.
Right.
Do we know each other?
I work for the ESA.
The ESA?
You' re here because of the Chancellor.
I' m Major Hathaway.
Enemy infiltration.
What' s this about?
What the hell are you doing?
Are you insane?
Do you know who this is?
Take it away.
Are you insane?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
(voices stop abruptly)
(groaning weakly)
Spencer Olham was a genius.
Cavendish Laboratory, top subatomic physicist and all by the age of 23.
Outstanding.
Father, John Olham, fighter pilot, distinguished service.
MlA case until they found his body at a Centauri P. O. W. camp.
He' d been flayed alive.
Young Spencer was eight years old.
Spencer Olham was a driven man.
I' m not happy about losing him.
And when I' m not happy, nobody' s happy.
Wha...
Do you like jokes?
I have a joke for you.
Knock, knock.
Why are you doing this?
Knock, knock.
Who' s there?
Not Spencer Olham.
What do you want?
Yes?
Ouch!
This was on its body.
Centauri.
Your native tongue.
Sounds like a wild boar on the make.
Anyway... we muddled through it and decoded your plan to infiltrate our installations using humanoid robots.
What?!
I' m a scientist.
You' re a scientist.
You know, you things are really something.
It' s not a mechanical robot at all... but a genetic cyborg evolved from synthetic DNA.
Now this will really excite you.
A Centauri hit list.
Humans targeted for murder and then replication.
Olham' s name -- on that list.
This is a mistake.
Now, l- l- I...
We have tests --
"We"? methods -- you can run a spiral core PET scan...
"We"?
Oh, I see you' ve learned to patronize, as well.
Please, listen to me.
DNA amplification...
Somewhere outside the city.
- Where?
Where is your ship?!
- This is insane.
Please, please listen to me.
I know you' re a tool for assassination.
You have no proof.
Your meeting tonight with the Chancellor -- that' s when you would detonate.
I am Spencer Olham, you crazy fuck!
Do you know when my dog pleases me most?
It' s when he displays human qualities.
Sometimes he cocks his head, puzzled.
You' re not the prototype.
We found this cyborg trying to pass himself off as an engineer at one of our Mars bases.
You' re making a mistake!
I got a wife and two kids!
Please don' t do this!
Please don' t do this!
My name is Jack Stoller!
My name is Jack Stoller!
Please stop!
Annoying, isn' t it?
If I could blow us all to hell, then what are you doing here?
The U- bomb is programmed to coalesce at trigger phase.
(snapping fingers)
Nelson...
Jesus Christ, don' t let them do this.
Please, tell them it' s me.
Nelson...
You got piss- drunk.
You hit on Maya and you begged her not to tell me.
Well, she told me, Nelson.
I never brought it up; I forgave you.
"made it all bearable.
They made it all worth it. "
It' s me, Nelson.
It' s me.
Please, help me.
This monster is out of his fucking mind!
Memories... senses, knowledge -- you pilfered them all.
Do you know what that is?
God is answering, "I quote... (whispers):
I want the answer.
Can God give you the answer?
Hmm?
His soul.
I forgave you, you son of a bitch.
let' s get started.
That' s right, let' s get started.
Hathaway' s a bit on the slow side, isn' t he?
Oh, too bad, he' s a little dim!
Hey, I got a joke for you.
Here' s my joke for the day:
Knock, knock.
Who' s there?
Hathaway.
Hathaway, who?
Hathaway the real target.
Fatal error.
Trigger phase activated.
Tick, tock.
Tick, tock.
Strap him in the Vivisec.
Tick, tock.
Tick, tock.
Target lock -- Kaboom!
He' s playing with you.
He' s trained to do that.
Strap in the robot.
Watch your fingers.
Enemy infiltration in progress.
(screams)
Oh, shit...
Shit.
(voices in distance) (alarm blaring)
(weapon cocking)
All clear at 19- 6!
Status.
Nelson...
Nelson... (groans)
You' re going to be all right.
Listen.
Veterans Hospital.
How may I direct your call?
Olham.
Maya Olham.
I' il transfer you.
Maya...
Hi, this is Dr. Olham at Veterans Hospital.
Please leave a message.
If this is a medical emergency enter code 2112.
You' il have 30 seconds after the symbol.
Maya, Christ, I need to know...
Spence?
Maya.
Thank God.
Are you all right?
What did they do to you?
Where are you?
Tell me what they told you -- the ESA.
They told me that you' ve been arrested for treason.
- Why you?
- Maya, please listen to me.
In the hospital.
I took it three years ago.
A test?
What does this have to do...?
You can' t...
But you see it, don' t you?
Maya...
You' re not...
You' re not listening to them, are you?
Spence, I need to know where you are.
COMPUTER:
Initiating lockdown.
From 20 Kansas through 19 Nevada.
Go!
Get portable scanners -- as many as you can find or steal.
Wake up the NMR team, put them on standby.
I want a hot- link into the Census Bureau Comm Center in case they get a hit that we don' t.
Major!
I have the Secretary of Defense calling for you.
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:
You would think the ESA - the premier special op force of our military machine - would be able to contain it in its own< containment facility, so... the first question I have for you, Major, is this:
Why are we having this conversation?
I take full responsibility.
He' s a good man.
Pick up your weapon, Major.
A good man is not what I need.
Is the replicant still pursuing its target?
We don' t know.
What is the range of the bomb?
We don' t know.
Is there a secondary trigger?
We don' t know.
Given that the Chancellor is landing in four hours is there anything you do know?
We know it' s either in the evac tunnels or out in the Zone.
I recommend you evacuate the city immediately.
You recommend that I set off a mass panic and you can' t even show me an X ray?
Mr. Secretary... the Centauri are well ahead of us in nanotechnology.
The bomb, it eludes standard detection.
The explosive parts coalesce at trigger phase.
(whispers):
Don' t fuck with me, Major.
Now, tell me how we deactivate it.
We shoot it.
HATHAWAY:
It wants to live.
It will make a mistake.
In the genius lies the defect.
Lucky for us... it bleeds.
And how many innocent men bled for your mistakes before you uncovered the first replicant?
Ten.
You don' t lose any sleep over those dead men do you, Hathaway?
We lost ten and saved 10, 000.
I sleep like a baby, Mr. Secretary.
533rd Street and Tyler Avenue.
In the Zone.
You shouldn' t be here.
I said you shouldn' t be here.
Attention, all inhabitants.
You have 30 seconds to comply.
Do not refuse, or you will be bodily removed.
Do not run, or you will be stopped by force.
This man is a prison escapee.
Take a good look at him.
Have you seen him?
(electronic whirring)
Come on!
Let' s go!
Hustle!
Burke, give me an update!
All right, let' s go.
All right, all right.
Take it down.
Ready yourself, gentlemen!
Burke... we are up, and now scanning (over radio): the building.
I make four holdouts ground floor, and a fifth on the second.
I' ve got another one.
Looks like a runner heading upstairs.
78% probability by body mass.
Identify runner on the fourth floor.
Go.
Target is not moving.
There must be old motors up there.
Goddamn it, Sergeant, give me a fix.
Getting magnetic interference, sir.
Go slow, Burke.
(on radio):
MAN (on P. A.):
Proceed.
You got a hard fix on him?
Whoa.
Identify your target, Burke.
Burke, identify your target!
Target appears to be...... a little girl, sir.
Next building, gentlemen.
Let' s go!
Move it out!
Let' s go!
Second building!
Go up the stairs on the south side!
(wind whistling)
WOMAN:
He' s too fucking hot.
40 minutes, they' re going to come get him.
Yes, ma' am.
Just let me see if I can trade something for him, okay?
(beeps)
Work record...... classified.
Which are you?
Look... those troopers will be back and they may not miss this place next time.
If you' re smart you' il just let me go.
Get up!
So where would it go if it was thinking like Spencer Olham?
Next quadrant.
Yes, sir!
Fall in!
This way.
This way.... at checkpoint D.
SPENCER:
Border patrol.
That' s right.
They pay good cash for runners like you.
You' re going to turn me in to the ESA.
Life' s a tragedy.
Move.
Whatever you' re going to trade me for -- whatever you can get, I' il triple it.
It' s too late.
(grunts)
House allocation, food rations...
I can get you all of it.
Come on, help me out.
Too late!
(grunts)
See that dome right there?
Now get up.
Walk!
I' m not going back to them.
I won' t die like that.
You' re useless to me.
Drugs: narco- phetamines adrenosteroids, pharmaceutical grade.
- What?
- So, what you think?
You' ve got me down?
You think you know me?
Right?
No, that' s not what I meant.
You know, I don' t like you.
I' m not saying "junkie," I' m saying "payoff."
I' m offering you a real trade.
Punch in this CimCode:
746- 218.
Come on.
Just do it.
"Maya June Olham."
Pretty girl.
35... no wants or warrants.
Associate Director...
Associate Director of Veterans Hospital, Central City Sector.
She' s my connection.
And she' il do anything... to get her husband back alive.
Now I know that you can run me into that city underground and I can get you inside that hospital supply.
In and out, clean.
So, what' s it going to be?
HATHAWAY:
Dr. Olham...
I' d like to convey my... my deepest regrets.
I had... great respect for your husband his work.
We...
We all mourn with you.
I' m Major Hathaway.
Yes, I know who you are.
We haven' t found your husband' s body yet but every effort is being made to locate his murderer this "Impostor..."
Don' t you think I' d know my own husband, Major?
I think we' d all like to believe that this never happened.
This "switch?"
While we slept?
While he showered?
When?
We don' t know when.
Oh, so, you don' t know for certain then, do you?
We know that the replicant poses a real threat to the public, Dr. Olham.
And since it believes it is your husband it will likely contact you turn to you for assistance or may have already.
Do you have a wife, Major?
Pardon?
Do you have a wife?
Yes.
Does she know you very well?
She knows I' m a human, if that' s what you mean.
And how does she know that?
Because I' m not on a Centauri hit list and I' m not walking around with a bomb in my ribcage.
And for every second that we debate known facts, we are closer to mass murder.
So I need to ask you a couple of simple questions.
Has it contacted you?
No.
Do you have any idea where it might go?
None.
I' m sure if something occurs to you you' il let Lieutenant Burrows know immediately.
My men will be escorting you home... to grieve.
I have six wards running at twice capacity, Major.
I' il grieve when my shift is over.
Nelson Gittes is dead.
Murdered by the replicant along with two of my men.
Oh, I' m sorry for them, too.
(patient coughing)
Take off your jacket.
There' s a big difference between you and me and I' m not talking about the obvious.
See, me, I ghost in and ghost out of the city.
You, the ESA will pick you off at the first census post.
WOMAN:
He' s going to need a knockout.
Whatever you got, keep it topical.
Government- issue Mercury Pentothal, my guess.
Yeah.
I' ve noticed.
You got anything to flush it with?
Adrenozine, maybe, but if we had that this would be a real hospital, and, uh, I' d be a real doctor.
You sure you don' t want to be out for this?
This hurts.
Well... now nobody' s going to know you when you' re visiting.
Hey, put this on.
And get rid of that G- coat.
No, I' il, uh...
Could be useful.
What' d she do with the CimCode?
Don' t worry about the CimCode.
She' il shred it.
Now, let' s go.
l- l- I' d like to keep it.
Hey.
Wait here.
Wait right here.
Spencer.
What did they tell you?
Because if we don' t have honesty in our relationship we have a dead relationship.
I' m not what they say I am.
Then what are you?
Just tell me what they said.
No, I want you to tell me.
You tell me.
They told you... that they couldn' t surface because it' s too hot up there.
And what else?
Your friends know I' m public enemy number one, that I' m worth something and then they just walk away.
Does that seem like your friends?
(grunts)
How about a trade, Cale?
Let' s talk trade.
Hey!
Where' d you learn to fight like that?
What' s your name?
Cale.
Is there anything else you want to know?
No.
Well, being that we' ve become so goddamn friendly why don' t you tell me what I want to know?
All right, Cale.
(laughs)
Let' s get moving.
(indistinct conversation)
Let' s go.
Transport available...
Also, aliens are required to wear an identification badge at all times...
Through this plaza swing east, another few blocks, we' re there.
Oh, Christ.
Not now.
- What' s the matter?
- He sees me.
What are you talking about?
Come on.
Easy, easy.
Where' s your ship?!
Come on, get up.
Come on... get up.
What the hell is happening to you?
The ESA gave me psychotropics.
I can' t carry you.
I need to hear that you' re with me.
They' ve gotten in my mind.
I can' t tell what' s real.
They want you to think that.
I' m a good man.
I didn' t know he was in there.
The doors opened...
(engine whooshing)
How many you see --
ESA?
(struggling)
Check the log!
One incoming within project sector...
Going back how far?
All right, it' s time to jerk the leash.
I want a house arrest, with a 24/ 7 watch.
No, no, no you keep all your men in place until you hear from me.
I' m telling you, it' s still prime stomping ground if it still believes... it' s Dr. Olham.
WOMAN:
Census Bureau reporting new hit -- Veterans Plaza.
South Sector of main promenade, post number 4- niner- 7.
Affirmative, Major.
Which direction?
Stand by, Major.
Patch it through to Burke, tell him to get over here and turn and burn some bodies immediately.
I got in close.
- Listen to me.
I got you here.
I put everything on the line for you
- You' il get it.
Olham...
You know
I' m beginning to think that the ESA got it right.
What do you mean?
I mean maybe you are a bomb.
Just don' t blow up in my face.
Comm Center /
I need an update.
Target heading south.
Go!
You told me the hospital would be clean.
Just wait.
In and out, right?
Why don' t we just do what you did?
Just give it a minute.
Let' s go!
Okay, so now you got me interested.
What' s in there for you?
Proof.
For them or for you?
They even have a name for where we are now?
It' s called "Reallocation."
The military took finishing funds away from the hospital.
This way.
(grunting)
WOMAN (on P. A.):
Countdown: five minutes.
Stand by.
Okay.
Second level, east side.
Go!
Comm Center, I am now at Post 4- 9- 6!
Stand by, Major.
I need men up on the east side roof.
Target passed your position 15 seconds ago.
It' s here.
It' s right here.
WOMAN (on P. A.):
Medivac Arrival.
(engines roaring)
No, go back!
(loud rumbling and high- pitched whine)
(metallic scraping)
Attention all available emergency personnel...
Anybody got a top sheet on this one?
Move it out!
Over here!
(crowd clamoring) (rapid beeping)
Hey, Olham.
What?
Make me a giraffe.
Somebody' s coming.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Good evening, Dr. Hall.
Please enter.
Only now would I call this a good day.
(rapid footsteps and man shouting instructions)
Cale...
Get what you need, and get out.
You don' t want to be here inside five minutes.
Cale don' t waste your time there.
The stuff you want is on the third level.
You' re into the immunomeds now.
That' s all... macroantibiotics.
I heard you.
Yeah, well that stuffs worth nothing to you unless you got Thaipox.
The woman in the Zoner hospital.
It' s for her isn' t it?
And the others.
It' s a big gun.
The military uses it for Thaipox and everything else.
Right now, you can leave through the front door.
After that...
Olham.
Don' t shoot yourself.
Check station.
So, drill me.
Drill me real good.
We' il all go out in a blaze of glory!
Long live the Centauri.
Target lock.
Kaboom!
Major, if I can suggest...
So... when we were running in idiot circles, when did we pull troops?
Captain Burke?
I pulled about a third of my detail from the project site, sir.
What about the chancellery?
In place -- full complement.
Lieutenant Burrows how many men do we have at the hospital?
Attention, all personnel.
An efficient hospital is a cooperative hospital.
Busy night.
15 hours straight.
She sends another evac every five minutes.
That' s not very nice, Dr. Carone.
She speaks so highly of you.
I' m sorry.
Where is she?
I don' t know.
Where is my wife?
I don' t know.
She left with the ESA maybe a half- hour ago.
You know what this is?
A data spool.
For?
Molecular- core PET scan.
Very good.
Now, I want you to run a comparative test for me and no...
I don' t have time to schedule an appointment.
Where' s the alarm?
(computer powering up)
(clattering)
(rapid clicking)
Call security.
(heavy sigh)
Walk away.
GUARD:
Do not move!
No, no, the orderly' s with...
Here.
You' il make it, Cale.
Walk out of here now.
(soldiers yelling)
WOMAN (on P. A.):
Security alert!
Security alert!
It' s him!
Hold your fire!
Don' t want cross fire.
He' s got nowhere to go.
Let' s move!
Come on, move up here!
(panting)
- Help!
- Get down!
Get out of the way!
Get down!
Is it down?
I had a bead on it, sir.
It was in my sight, sir.
I need a crash cart, now!
Find me a body!
Give me your weapon.
GUARD 1:
Straight back!
Take a good look at this.
SPENCER:
They went camping this weekend up in Sutton Wood.
Dome Authority has already ruled out a lightning strike...
Maya.
Are they still there?
Are they right outside?
Maya, listen to me.
You' ve got to trust me.
- Trust me...
- Spence.
Please!
If you still believe in me... all I ask is that you... you meet me.
Meet me where we first met.
That' s all I ask.
Spence?!
Spence?!
Keep walking!
Where are you?
Maya.
Did they follow you?
No.
I know you' re afraid.
I know what they told you.
A cyborg destroyed my body.
They were right... in theory but they made one crucial error...
I don' t understand.
The ship crashed.
You see, that' s what - that' s what caused the fire.
They miscalculated.
The Centauri never got to me!
I know the ship is here.
I can find it.
I' il show you.
Do you believe them?
You' re bleeding.
Do you believe them?
I don' t know what to believe.
They told me things...
They said you killed Nelson.
They searched the house.
They- they... they went through our clothes...
Did they hurt you?
No.
They kept grilling me... asking me for proof of God.
All I could think of was you.
I don' t expect anything from you.
I just wanted to see you again.
No.
What?
I don' t believe them.
You' re the only one I can trust.
(soldiers yelling)
They' il kill you!
Spence!
(gasping)
We got to get inside!
(grunt) (shouting)
Maya, help me!
Spencer!
You were wrong!
Yes, I was wrong.
I know that now.
You listen to me.
You need to come over here with us.
Come on.
Spencer, listen to me.
Spencer, listen.
We decoded more of the Centauri hit list.
Cryptography had it wrong.
You need to come over here with us, Spencer.
- It' s moving.
- Listen to me.
- what' s in there.
- Go ahead, shoot me.
Spencer, you don' t want...
Just shoot me.
You do not want to see what' s in there.
- Shoot me.
- You do not want to see...
Spencer... it wasn' t you who they wanted.
Please...
Spencer, please, don' t believe him.
That is not your wife.
That thing... murdered your wife.
Don' t listen to them... please... don' t!
(gasping)
Look at me.
Come to me.
No... no...
Steady.
Steady, Spencer.
I...
This morning, we...
- Sir, sir...
Get away from her!
- Yes, sir.
HATHAWAY:
It would' ve massacred us all.
You know that, Spencer.
Major!
Major!
Major!
Oh, God...
(beeping)
We' ve been able to accelerate your regimen in the past two weeks but I need you to keep coming back, huh?
You' re not all better yet.
Now this is the medicine I need you to take.
- I' m all right.
- Feel better, huh?... 14, 000 kilometers above Earth.
Dr. Maya June Olham of the Veterans Hospital Administration and Dr. Spencer John Olham, with the Defense Bureau.
Spencer Olham had been wanted in connection with espionage charges, which came as a shock to many who remembered him only as a deeply- principled and patriotic man.
We lose lives to progress.
It' s a necessary sacrifice.
As a layman...
You' il excuse me.
You knew him?
I' d like to think so.
(passionate breathing)
For once I believe you because it' s just rotten enough.
We' re both rotten.
You' re a little more rotten.
You got me to take care of your husband.
Then you' d get Zachetti to take care of Lola, maybe me too.
Then somebody would come along to take care of Zachetti.
That' s how you operate.
Suppose it is?
Is what you' ve got cooked up for tonight any better?
I don' t like that music anymore.
Mind if I close the window?
You can do better than that, can' t you, baby?
Better try it again.
Maybe if I came a little closer.
How' s this?
Think you can do it now?
Why didn' t you shoot again, baby?
Don' t tell me it' s because you' ve been in love with me all this time.
No, I never loved you, Walter, or anybody else.
I used you just as you said.
That' s all you ever meant to me...... until a minute ago...
- What the fuck are you doing? -... when I couldn' t fire that second shot.
You know what time it is?
At 2200, Wetsuit' s down the hole when the snake hits the carpet.
Security lifts the key.
I terminate the torpedoes.
Charm the snake into the stall.
Bait and switch.
At 2220, Wetsuit turns out the lights.
Glasses on.
I bag the snake.
Key in the bag.
Bag to the boat.
No radio unless absolutely necessary.
Code red, five minutes to blackout.
Drop everything.
Walk away.
lf the cops catch you, tell them the truth.
You know no one.
Got it?
Got it?
You have your passport?
The plane leaves tomorrow at 0700.
And remember, no names and no guns.
Are you high?
Then stop dreaming, bitch.
This isn' t a game tonight.
People can die.
Now get moving.
You forget something?
Good evening.
Thank you very much.
Oh, it' s a picture of you?
- Let' s go.
- I got to go to the bathroom.
- You know how it is for girls.
- You come back?
One minute.
With an ass like that, I don' t think you need makeup.
Mademoiselle Veronica?
Okay, baby.
Baby, wake up.
- We gotta go.
- No.
Time to go.
Mademoiselle Veronica?
The key' s in the bag.
Get moving!
Move!
You better get out of here.
Go!
Asshole!
You said, no fucking guns!
Where' s my passport?
You better kill me now, bitch.
Shut the fuck up!
Understand?
Dead!
No, you don' t understand.
I need a passport yesterday.
Did you get it?
Here.
Wait!
Did you hear that?
What is that?
What the fuck are you doing?
Excuse me, madame, but I believe this is a free country.
I' m entitled to make any picture of anything I want from my balcony.
Go fuck yourself!
Go to church.
Try to save your soul.
Got you!
Lily!
Lily!
Hotel Sheraton.
Maybe I should hire you.
I got you, fucking bitch!
Come on!
Before I snap your double- crossing neck!
Just tell me one thing.
Where are the diamonds?
Payback time, bitch!
Holy shit!
Oh, my God!
Yep.
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
You were sleeping.
Are you okay?
I didn' t mean to frighten you, I' m sorry.
Are you okay?
I' m sorry.
Yes.
California.
I mean, I grew up in California, but I live in Washington now.
And what do you do, in life?
ln life?
Well, I started in software, ordinateur...... and made some money...... then found out that I was interested in other things.
Like what things?
I went back to school in Washington.
Got a degree in foreign relations, taught for a little while.
Then got a posting at the State Department.
America is a country very big, no?
Very big. ls this your first trip?
I begin my new life there.
France is no good for me.
How can you say that?
France is a fabulous country.
It' s the queen of Europe to me.
The art, the history...... the sense of language, Stendhal, Racine, Balzac --
I lost my baby there.
I' m sorry, I don' t know what to say.
That' s terrible.
Please forgive me.
I didn' t know.
It' s okay.
It' s okay.
That is just awful.
What, are you dodging bill collectors?
- I know.
- What are you doing?
- Working.
- Something I could sell?
- Could be.
Just need one more piece.
Another shot of that table?
Are you eating?
Barely.
Like to take a break from your masterwork and make some money?
- What are you selling?
- You know who Bruce Hewitt Watts is?
Strange as it may seem to you, photographers actually read.
- Books, magazines, even newspapers.
- All right, smart- ass.
Who is he?
- New American ambassador?
- Bingo.
He' s got a wife, but no one seems to have a picture of her.
- Maybe she' s camera- shy.
- No.
She' s got a past...... and she' s not talking.
She' s French.
Married before, with a kid.
I got an ex I don' t talk about.
What' s wrong with that?
Nothing, except you don' t dodge photographers like you' re hiding.
- So you want me to nail her, right?
- You are the best.
Come on, you know I don' t like to do this.
- I feel like shit and besides, I am retired.
- On what, IOUs?
I' m not just your agent.
I' m your bank, and you' re way past due.
Do yourself a favor and go to work.
I get five figures for this picture.
All right.
What' s her schedule?
She arrives by private jet tonight.
- I gotta go.
Bye.
- Take that picture.
Shit!
- ls this Nicolas Bardo?
- Speaking.
You took a picture of Mrs. Watts?
Who wants to know?
Leonard Shiff, head of Watts' security.
I' d like to buy it.
Well, I' m sorry, Mr. Shiff, but it' s already been sold.
Unsell it.
We' il double whatever you got.
That' s very generous, but l --
You don' t realize who you' re dealing with.
We know all about you.
Your overdrawn bank account, your criminal record.
I suggest you get that picture back, and you bring it to me...... at the residence tomorrow morning, 1 1 a. m. sharp.
Don' t keep me waiting.
Sir, hold on.
Hello?
Park Bardo in the office until I can get --
Hold on a second.
I don' t believe it.
This paparazzi scum is wearing a wire.
Make sure it doesn' t get past security.
Hold on.
Une minute, pal.
Damn it!
Oh, shit.
- ls the bar open?
- Yes, of course, sir.
But you can' t stay there.
Please move your bike.
Can' t leave it there.
- You can' t leave it there.
- I know, I know.
- Please.
Hi.
-... and I think I left my disk here.
- Disk?
When I got home, I checked my laptop, and the backup disk was gone.
It' s the only copy I have.
I searched like hell for it.
Then I remember, the only place I could' ve left it was here.
- Do you mind if I take a look?
- I don' t think it' s a good idea --
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, my God, I got so much information on that disk.
You didn' t see a disk, right?
Actually, it' s not a disk.
It' s not like a CD or DVD or anything like that.
It' s called floppy.
It' s like a black thing you introduce in the computer.
I am remembering now that I put it there.
Because I was working in bed.
I love, I just love to work in bed.
I bet you do too.
Anyway, let me just remember exactly what I did.
I just -- I sat over here.
I sat over here, put it on my lap because it' s a laptop and plug it over there.
It happens that I wasn' t alone.
I wasn' t alone, and --
Oh, my God!
That' s not your business.
Well, no, it' s not.
It' s not, but it is.
Because....
Excuse me.
Are you all right?
I think I can help you.
I have been working in a hospital, I' m a candy striper.
Sit down.
Give me your arms.
Put them up like this:
And relax, relax!
And breathe.
Breathe and relax.
And now listen to me.
Listen to me good.
I' ve been accused of having an overactive imagination...... but when a classy woman checks into an airport hotel...... in the morning with bullets and a gun...... there' s one word that follows.
What word?
Bang!
Now, if a guy walks in, maybe there doesn' t have to be a bang.
Coffee?
Well....
Maybe we should start with some introductions?
I don' t care who you are...... and I don' t want you to know who I am.
All right, that' s fair enough.
Let' s call me Harry.
And let' s start with the shiner.
Who is beating you up?
- Must we talk about this?
- Yes.
Or we' re gonna go find a local police station, and we' il talk about it there.
- My husband.
- All right.
Why?
He has...... difficulty...... to control his temper.
Why does he lose it?
Because I can' t live with him here.
- Why not?
- I have a past here.
I was safe in the States, but here, it only takes one photo.
Like the one today.
I took that picture.
So Harry is Nicolas Bardo.
Why did you follow me?
To get more photos?
No, no, I....
I came to tell your security goon, Mr. Shiff...... l couldn' t stop the picture from being published.
Anyone can see that.
You' ve wasted your time.
This espresso is cold.
- Can I get you another cup?
- Why?
There' s nothing more to say.
Can I go now?
You have the gun.
- Sex shops are open all day.
- I don' t think I' il be going to one.
How can I be sure?
I need air, but I don' t want to talk anymore.
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please.
We advise you not to leave luggage unattended and to beware of pickpocket.
That kind of thing.
I' ve got these crazy photographer ideas.
Don' t think I' m a paparazzi.
I feel like shit, but I have to make some money.
This one particular with light reflections...... and I saw something that changed my life.
- It' s a great story.
- This is the best part.
I know, I know.
Maybe another time.
It' s a great story.
But right now I' m very tired...... and I' d like to take a warm bath and relax a little...... before I go home, okay?
Thank you for today.
I' il be waiting out here, just in case you need anything.
- You don' t trust me, do you?
- No, no, no.
It' s not that.
It' s just being careful.
- Are you all right?
I' m out of my medicine.
- There was a pharmacy in the airport.
- That' s right.
My --
My inhaler is in my car.
They can refill it for me there.
That wouldn' t be being careful.
I....
Nicolas, take my car...... take my purse...... if you' re so worried that I go somewhere.
You can call a taxi.
Come on.
Yes, Nicolas.
I could call a taxi...... but I' m not going to do that.
I' m not going to need these in the bath.
Wait, wait.
Hold it.
Definitely not going anywhere without them.
Are you flirting with me?
- Was l?
- Well....
I believe so.
I didn' t mean to.
It' s just that...... all your boyhood stories...... make you so...... damn lovable.
Was that the point?
Well, it' s not mine, but somebody loaned it to me.
Lay down.
This doesn' t make much sense.
I' m Chief lnspector Serra.
Maybe you can help me out.
I said it already.
But, okay, all right.
Mrs. Watts is trying to kill herself.
I stopped her.
So she set me up for you guys, to get me out of the way.
- That' s it.
- How did you come up with that?
I read a lot of mysteries, and I figure out the endings halfway.
I know what happened.
What happened, Mr. Bardo...... was a car belonging to Ambassador Watts was found in your possession.
I know that.
On the front seat was a gun, bullets...... a blouse and dress.
Where is she?
I don' t know.
I don' t know.
- You check out the hotel?
- Yeah.
We found a naked waitress in a coma.
Did you have anything to do with that?
No.
No, no.
I wasn' t there.
I was buying an inhaler.
lnhaler?
Yes!
An inhaler!
All right, Mrs. Watts has asthma.
So I went to a pharmacy to get her prescription refilled.
That' s it.
That' s correct.
Yeah.
And you kept the gun so she wouldn' t shoot herself?
That' s right.
Why would she want to do that?
- Excuse me?
- Why would she want to do that?
Well, her husband was beating her up because she wanted to leave him.
The American ambassador beats his wife?
Yes, and she has the face to prove it.
You see...... l' m kind of a mystery buff myself.
And you know what kind of mystery this is?
- A kidnapping.
- Come on.
Ambassador' s wife held for ransom.
Everything was going fine until someone reported a stolen car.
No, no.
What are you talking about?
No.
I am no kidnapper, sir.
Why don' t we go to the residence and see what he has to say?
I think this is a terrible misunderstanding.
I spoke with Mrs. Watts.
She explained how she let Mr. Bardo use her car.
I don' t know who reported it stolen.
My attorney has indicated to me that no crime has been committed.
So I' m a little confused as to what we' re doing here, inspector.
- You spoke to your wife yourself?
- Could I speak with her?
- I don' t think that' s necessary.
This has been an awkward situation for all concerned...... and I really don' t want to prolong it.
I have an engagement.
Please excuse me.
lnspector Serra...... you' ve displayed a boorish lack of sensitivity towards the ambassador.
We do not need or want your investigative skills employed...... to discover why Mrs. Watts was in a hotel bedroom with Mr. Bardo.
I suggest you return to your duties and drop this matter.
I' d still like to talk to Mrs. Watts.
- And what crime has she committed?
- No crime.
I just wanna see her.
Well, I' m sure we all want to see lots of people.
But, fortunately, in our country and in yours...... they are not compelled to see us.
Good day, inspector.
- Sir.
- You know the penalty for a handgun?
- Then we' il just keep it.
Now, about your motorcycle.
You really want to report it stolen?
lf it wasn' t at the hotel, somebody took it.
Why don' t you look a little harder?
- Sir.
You don' t believe one thing I said, right?
Not only don' t I believe you, I don' t even like you.
Look, Bardo, I know who you are.
Ex- paparazzi smart- ass, who hasn' t worked for seven years.
I don' t know what you' re up to, but it' s not smart.
Keep it up and you' il wind up in a cellblock full of smart guys like you.
"Mr. Watts, if you ever want to see your wife again...... bring 1 0 million dollars in bearer bonds to the Passerelle Debilly...... at 2 a. m. this morning.
lf you inform the police or arrive with anyone besides yourself...... she will be killed. "
Oh, shit!
Son of a bitch!
Mrs. Watts.
Call me Lily.
Okay, Lily.
What the hell do you think you' re doing, Lily?
Are you mad at me?
Mad?
You are making everybody think I' ve kidnapped you.
- Haven' t you?
No, Nicolas.
You' re right, it' s not funny.
It wasn' t funny when you sold my picture either.
And then you showed up to do what?
Explain?
Lie?
I felt responsible for it!
That' s so sweet, Nicolas.
I' m a bad girl, Nicolas.
Real bad.
Rotten to the heart.
Last scrape I was in, I fucked up a lot of people.
Bad people, people like me.
People that don' t forget.
But I was given a second chance.
So I went back to the States, where I got everything a bad girl ever wanted.
Fucking Watts.
He was kind of a sweet guy until being the richest man wasn' t enough.
He had to have public glory.
He gave away a ton of money, bought the ambassadorship...... which meant the little missis got dragged out in the Parisian limelight.
Well, I couldn' t do that, because bad people read newspapers too.
Et voilà.
Enter my worst nightmare.
You snap that fucking picture, sell it to the tabloids...... and now it' s only a matter of time before those bad people come running.
So I got the photographer turned blackmailer to kidnap me.
Blackmailer?
You offered me money!
And I have never kidnapped anybody, you fucking bitch!
Then where am I, Nicolas?
Why did you have my car, my clothes, a gun?
Why was a ransom note e- mailed from your computer?
- Everyone knows you did it.
- I' ve gotta think.
- What?
- I' ve gotta think about --
You don' t have to think about anything.
I' ve got it all thought out for you.
Watts is coming up here at 2 a. m. with $1 0 million.
Now, if you start being a little nice to me...... l might cut you in on the take.
- We are going to the police.
- Why would you wanna do that?
You' re gonna tell them the crazy story you just told me.
What, do you think I' m stupid?
I' m not gonna tell them that story.
I' m gonna tell them the kidnapping story, starring you.
- Son of a bitch!
- Nicolas.
- I went back to that sex shop.
- Oh, shit.
What did you do with that other gun?
- The cops took it.
- They did?
- Yes, they did.
- I got you another one.
- It' s all right.
lsn' t sugar better than vinegar?
Come on.
Let' s go do something fun, you want to?
What?
Nicolas, where are you going?
I' m just going to buy some cigarettes.
Pack of cigarettes.
Anything American.
What' s your name?
Hey, Nicolas.
Come here.
- Meet my friend Napoleon.
I think he' s in love.
Can we just go outside?
I need to talk to you.
Come on!
Just be cool.
- I' m gonna go outside.
Nicolas.
We don' t want you to wait out in the cold.
Do we, Napoleon?
I mean, if we hit it off --
I thought of letting you off the hook.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You don' t seem to be enjoying my company much.
Maybe Napoleon and I should sail off into the sunset...... and you can go fuck yourself.
I hope you didn' t kill him.
He was gonna save me from a dip in the Seine.
What?
We had big plans.
I was gonna go off the bridge into his boat.
Big plans.
Oh, poor Lily, whatever happened to her?
She must have drowned and washed out to sea.
Fuck you.
What' s the matter, Nicolas?
Don' t I make you jealous?
Jealous?
Yes.
Yes.
I was jealous.
I am jealous.
Nicolas, you don' t have to lick my ass.
Just fuck me.
- You know what?
- What?
We can still go away.
Both of us, together.
That' s so sweet.
Come here.
Come here.
That' s so romantic.
But without the money?
Are you nuts?
Yes.
A bad choice.
There are other ones.
What, like doing the right thing?
I tried that once, Nicolas.
And you know what it got me?
A lifetime of looking over my shoulder.
You know why no good deed goes unpunished?
Because this world is hell, and you' re nothing but a fucking patsy.
I made everybody think you kidnapped me...... so I could screw my husband out of 1 0 million bucks.
That' s what it' s all about.
Me disappearing with 1 0 million bucks.
So wipe it off...... and let' s go get it.
Fuck you!
You' re not gonna hurt her, right?
Because I' ve done exactly what you' ve told me to do.
I brought the money...... and I haven' t talked to anyone.
- Don' t do anything foolish, darling.
- I won' t.
He just wants me to take the money and bring it back to him.
Okay!
Watts, it' s Nicolas Bardo.
Your wife is staging this kidnapping to take your $1 0 million.
lf you don' t believe me, I got it right here on tape.
What the fuck do you think you' re doing?
I was just being careful.
Fucking bitch!
You didn' t think I' d give you a gun loaded with real bullets, did you?
Baby...... there' s one more thing we gotta do.
Oh, God!
Somebody, help!
My husband.
Fucking over everyone again?
But not this time.
Where are the diamonds?
Fuck you!
Wake up, bitch!
Before you die!
You know what' s in this?
The bullet that' s going to spread your brains all over that wall.
You know how I know?
Look at me.
I' m your fucking fairy godmother...... and I just dreamt your future.
And mine too.
And all I know is...... if there' s a chance of any of that shit happening, we' re gonna change it here.
Now listen.
I know you got a bad break, but you better forget it.
Because if you can' t...... then you may as well go ahead and pull the trigger.
But if you don' t end it here...... and you get your ass on that plane to America...... your future will be sitting right next to you.
His name is Bruce, and he' s a really good guy.
He' il look into your eyes...... and he' s gonna fall in love.
And after that, you' re on your own.
So, what do you say?
Do I pull the trigger?
Or do you get your ass on that plane...... and have a wonderful life?
Are you dodging bill collectors?
Nick, asshole, it' s Johnny.
- I know who you are.
- What' s up?
- Trying to catch lightning in a bottle.
- Are you eating?
- Barely.
- Like to make some real money?
- What are you selling, John?
- You know who Bruce Hewitt Watts is?
- The new American ambassador?
- Bingo.
He' s got a wife and three kids, but no one has a picture of them.
Maybe they' re camera- shy.
Some people like to keep their home life private.
I know it' s weird, but they do.
You owe me, pal.
That' s your half.
A little under 4 million.
That' s the best I could do.
I had to fence them off one at a time.
Sorry that it took so long, but it was the safest way.
Not bad for a night' s work, huh?
You call that work?
Bye, Laure.
It' s best if we don' t see each other again.
