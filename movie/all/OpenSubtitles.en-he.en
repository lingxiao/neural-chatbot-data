He was a wild spirit and this was always to be his fate.
I' il never set my sights elsewhere.
As long as we stay here, there' il never be enough to eat.
All it takes is one demon to follow you back from the forbidden land.
Then we' d all be struck down.
So the gods left...... allowing the demons to descend from the sky.
Only if you believe in fate.
I can' t take you.
You can handle yourself better than most men...... which is why you need to help the village.
She hoped it' d be passed to your children.
It' s for good luck.
Don' t let anything happen to you out there.
Easy!
Easy!
So you' re the beast we' re all afraid of.
Not a lot of meat on a dragon.
I hope you thanked the gods.
You from the caves?
You lying thieves.
Wait a minute.
We need food.
We must hunt.
Wait.
The way to the great god village is marked by these frozen ones.
Those that disobeyed were frozen in place for all of eternity.
Here!
Are you sure this was a god?
Let' s eat.
Go.
Always looking for something better, something out there.
Maybe she was right.
Sharp.
So if you were stupid enough to leave a good woman behind...... why don' t you tell me where she is so I can go get her for myself?
Get out of here.
I can' t move!
Oh, heavenly gods!
It' s poison!
My chest is on fire!
I can' t!
Get off my brother.
- Don' t know.
He shot the wrangler.
I swear.
The man- animal got ahold of this gun.
Any report filed today still has my name on it...... and you are out of your skull- bone if you think I' m going to write...... "shot by a man- animal" as the cause of death unless I see it!
If I obey your command, I may get killed.
If you don' t, it' s a certainty you will be killed.
Well, I' il be damned.
I' m afraid so, sir.
And the human- animals, grossly undersized.
- Thank you.
Spy satellites recorded those.
- Yes.
Well, dogs did prove to be more cooperative than the man- animals.
Thank you, Planetship.
Thank you, Your Excellency.
Now, let' s see.
You must be looking forward to getting off this disgusting excuse of a planet.
I just want to do whatever serves the corporation best, sir.
I do what I can.
So we' ve decided to keep you for another tour of service.
Are you not aware that I graduated top of my class?
That' s why we' ve decided not to keep you here for another five cycles.
With endless options for renewal!
The senator' s exact words to me were, and I' m quoting:
But cheer up.
You haven' t left for Psychlo.
Give me three pans to go.
While you were still learning how to spell your name...... I was being trained to conquer galaxies!
That' il be six credits.
I do now.
You' re new here, so I' il explain how it works.
If there' s anything left, you can share it with them.
Greener, let' s just stay alive.
You' re right.
Sir.
- What?
It shows a rockslide in the mountains.
I don' t mind.
... can get there without his breath gas exploding.
It' s worthless!
You can' t shoot me.
You do not have to shoot me, sir.
If the worker revolt takes place, my informants tell me...... that the first order of business is to separate you from your head.
Which is why there will be no revolt.
The best way is to increase profits and stop cutting the workers' pay.
And I' ve already ordered as many new workers as possible...... to boost production.
Man- animals operating machinery?
If it doesn' t work out, no one will know.
- And if it does work...... I will be vaporized.
There you have it.
And that is final!
Run!
Pull his breath mask off.
That' s the wager.
No way this man- animal lasts more than four minutes.
The damn thing cheated.
All we have to do is find out what it is...... then we' il have leverage.
The gold belongs to them.
It' s the perfect crime, sir.
So it is my duty to report you...... though you' il be vaporized, and I' il have to train a new assistant.
Think of it as part of your education.
Education, huh?
But why do I have to be the patsy?
But I' d never double- cross you.
How the crap should I know?
Let them think they' ve escaped...... and then we' il sit back and watch it choose its favorite food.
Look!
Now that the man- animals feel...... that they have enough distance from us...... soon they' il find their favorite food and celebrate.
Food!
- That' s their favorite.
- It' s not cooked.
We' re really going to have leverage over them now.
Don' t be a knot- head.
It' s a man- animal.
You sure called that one, sir.
Move your fat ass and let' s go round them up!
Crap, lousy ceiling!
This is great.
That' s your choice.
I' m not going back!
Get them mad, think what they' il do to us.
... for I do not have the honor to be a Psychlo.
Please forgive my pretension...... as I try to educate you in Psychlo...... the noble language of our superiors.
You understand?
You understand me?
Yes?
Obviously, this is going to take a while.
Jonnie!
It' s a knowledge machine.
I have to stay.
To each other.
No, only at first.
This is the symbol for water and engineering.
I thought we were supposed to be working on stuff to help us escape.
All this will.
Human.
Eight?
The question is, how clever?
Look at this.
Stop!
I can' t give you permission to go and get killed.
I don' t need your permission.
Do you want lunch?
Maybe we should train another one.
We' il have to terminate the operation and cover our tracks.
Go on, say something else.
Because you' ve learned Psychlo doesn' t mean you are one.
How exactly do you plan to do that?
- Mickey, no!
Drop him or I won' t mine an ounce of your gold.
You don' t have time.
That' il be the day.
As long as you cling to the feeble hope...... that you' il ever get the better of me...... you' il be distracted from more important things.
When we attacked your planet...... all your soldiers and all their advanced technology...... could only put up a nine- minute fight...... before they were exterminated.
Yes.
You will be relocated to a new mining site.
Destroy it!
Shoot!
You can' t defeat them.
Yes, we can.
If you' re fighting the beast, me and my men are with you.
May the gods be with you.
I know if I' d tried, you would' ve killed me first.
That' s the first intelligent thing you' ve said.
There' s something I need you to see so you' re properly motivated.
No, I don' t know her.
On the other hand, what you show marginal proficiency at is...
This was found when she was collected.
So if you disobey me, let me show you what will happen.
I believe you.
Fine.
This is...... cages!
Even if we escaped and went back to where we all came from...... it' d be like you said.
I think that is not living either.
Ker, I' d like you to meet Chirk.
I see.
Well, that' s why I especially chose you.
- Right.
Well, isn' t it interesting...... that you have been keeping two sets of books...... and telling all the workers...... that the planet has been operating at a loss?
I only claimed that it was running at a loss...... to try and motivate them all to work harder.
Did it?
Well, unfortunately, the company requires me to vaporize you.
- You can?
It' s really of no interest to anybody...... to have you not be Planetship.
But it would be prudent of you to start to share your authority.
You could put anything you wanted on them.
I would be nothing but a puppet.
... the book.
That' s not even the crazy part.
Man- animals being able to mine?
An order is an order.
First, learning how to fly...... then on to the learning machine for mining techniques.
Again.
Up, down!
This is as far as I can go!
I want the ship' s cage half- filled with gold.
... I' il be watching you.
Good.
No, no, no.
But if we don' t deliver it in 1 4 days to Terl, he' s just gonna kill us.
Listen, there will be no mining, but we' il deliver it.
We barely have men to do one of those things...... Iet alone all three.
It' s good to have friends on the outside!
We couldn' t have crossed all these lines.
The lines must have faded over time.
This is where our people' s history was buried.
Here.
- That' s good for us.
Safe from being hunted...... but radiation is also poisonous for humans.
So, you see, either way...... if we don' t take back our planet...
Based on what I' ve read about Psychlo security...... if we revolted...... only using weapons they don' t perceive as any real threat...... if we just use rocks and sticks...... they' il just throw us back in the cages.
So the Psychlos are gonna have to come inside the city to round us up.
And that is when we blow the dome.
- Carlo?
Piece of cake.
We' il destroy their Home Planet before it happens.
Count us in.
Flying spears.
According to the book, there' s a firing mechanism...... that has to be in place before it' s operational.
Get it?
What?
You' re sorry.
Good work, Mickey.
- There' s enough to destroy it forever.
- Let me do it.
Let me go there and detonate the weapon.
You' re the only one who speaks the monsters' language.
Listen...... without you leading this revolt...
I hope their eye in the sky didn' t see the gold through the lead walls.
We' il hide half and deliver the other half to Terl tonight.
Why is it in bars?
I assumed, sir...... that a Psychlo of your refinement wouldn' t want raw ore.
Really?
Since you have had extra time...... to smelt it into bricks...... I' il expect the rest of the gold in seven days.
He has no intention of sharing that gold with you.
What the hell are you talking about?
No.
It really is amazing...... the collection of discs you find in Terl' s personal vault.
Because if you don' t give me the disc now...... I will blow your head off.
You want to trade?
Hooray!
After tonight, won' t matter much either way.
For our children.
Children?
Beautiful.
Quickly!
When they detect the gold...... the Planetship will know what we' re doing.
We' il have to terminate the operation and cover our tracks.
When they detect the gold, the Planetship will know what we' re doing.
I' ve been thinking.
Maybe pretty ones this time.
Ker- bango!
Which means I haven' t wasted my time training you, have l?
- You' re not upset?
You know how long I' ve waited for this day?
I know the perfect way to celebrate.
How am I supposed to know who it is?
I don' t know.
The control bunker' s to the right.
I' il take the guardhouse.
Five guards from the south, heavily armed and moving fast.
Jonnie!
Psychlos!
7- 7- 3.
What' s going on?
Hold on!
Just hurry up, because I' ve got company.
Here they are.
Panther!
I' m right on his tail.
Greener, come on.
I' m seconds away.
Go!
Teleportation sequence terminated.
Jonnie?
Why isn' t it coming down?
The dome is holding!
- It' s only cracked!
Attention!
And happy hunting!
Run!
What' s with the dome?
Hold on, I' m taking it out now.
They' re killing us!
I think we should pull out!
In five.
Three.
One.
Go!
Teleportation sequence activated.
I repeat, a stage 3 alert.
You have been quite a challenge, rat- brain.
Thanks for reminding me, rat- brain.
Trust me, there' s nothing I want more.
Carlo came through.
Why don' t you vaporize me?
Leverage.
... then all the credits in the universe...... won' t equal the bounty on your head.
Kill them.
- It works now.
Since I' m teaching them our technology, they made me the head Psychlo.
Look at the bright side.
You may not be wallowing in luxury on Psychlo...
... but at least you finally got your gold.
- Five?
But tough decisions do go with the job.
Burden of command, correct?
These salutes, I' ve given them some thought.
Technically, they are not a violation of regulations.
So, if the inmates can confine themselves to a simple... hand movement through the hair,
I see no problem with it.
And if the men want to call you chief, well, that' s fine.
Free speech and all that.
- No, not okay.
It' s too late, Colonel.
- For your offer.
The men don' t want to salute.
They don' t want more TV.
So do I.
A disgrace to the uniform.
- I think you should.
Tell me, Mr. Irwin, what' s to stop me from just... placing you in the hole... for, say, six months?
If that' s the way you want to win.
- maybe we should isolate prisoner Irwin -- - Get me General Wheeler.
Yes, sir.
A minor eccentricity.
Now, you wouldn' t want to give up all these perks, would you?
Yesterday, Mr. Irwin... told me he required my resignation.
Frankly, I think he' s started to lose the plot.
You saying he' s delusional?
Uh, you might want to be a little more careful in your word choice.
I know.
General Wheeler, I admire the man as much as you do.
And I' m not sure that this is the right place for that.
Well, let me see him.
Do we read the rules, sir?
And, uh, hands must be visible at all times, also.
Thank you, gentlemen.
- Permission granted.
- [Chuckles]
- Jim -- Jim, yeah -- Hold on -- - Miss Kelly?
- I found that --
We just needed you to send him up here as soon as possible.
He' s saying I' m delusional because he wants me gone.
[Wheeler]
He' s been exonerated three times.
But without any new evidence, what would be the point?
Now, haven' t you punished yourself enough?
All teams.
I can have my staff write up a compassionate release on medical grounds.
- I see no indication of anything, sir.
Gene, what the hell is this about?
- Go, go, go, go, go!
On the floor, now!
- What are you doing?
All inmates remain on the ground in the prone position.
- What is this!
What is this for Christ' s sake?
- [Shouting Continues]
- [Door Slams Shut]
Go, go, go, go!
- All right!
[Screaming, Yelling]
Tear gas?
Nothing is happening.
It was a bluff.
Return to hangar.
You thought he was gonna try to take me hostage?
- What the hell kind of... grab- ass unit are you running here, Colonel?
Sir, at 1 1: 58 this morning, I received a letter... stating a group of inmates were planning on taking you hostage at 1 2: 1 0.
I thought it prudent to act immediately to ensure your safety.
I' ve been hearing some disturbing things about what goes on in here.
- Yes, you may.
But until you' ve spent some time in the yard with those animals, you have no idea what happens in there.
Nevertheless, if I hear... one more story about a man dying under your command, you are through here.
- Yes, sir.
I wish he wasn' t.
Frankly, I' d like nothing more than an excuse to get him out of here.
But I see the only way that' s gonna happen is if you request it.
He' s gone.
Oh, I think I can handle him, sir.
You watch yourself, Colonel.
’ Eugene R. Irwin, ’ Lieutenant General, United States Army, ’ in direct contravention of an order to evacuate Burundi... by his commander- in- chief -- ’
Eight men were captured and executed. ‘
Disregarding... reliable intelligence... eight men... were executed.
A man who will do anything for one more victory notch on his belt, no matter what the cost, before he fades away.
- [Protesting Shouts]
Let' s go.
Let' s go for a little walk.
- Open it up!
Relax, ladies.
- Hold him down, men!
- No!
- Turn him around.
- Don' t put me in the hole!
- Thanks, man.
What do we do now?
Attention, inmates.
The problem is his flush beat your straight.
- 20 men apiece.
- Chopper.
Sir, are you sure we should be having this discussion this man standing --
You know he can' t be trusted, right?
I don' t know.
Is that how you use the burden of command?
To make men into -- into, uh, chess pieces?
Why don’ t you do yourself a favor and run along.
That prisoner walking away, who is that?
He takes bets.
Ahhh.
’ This highly effective officer seems to have no moral grounding whatsoever. ’
Is that so?
Well, that' s what men better than me seem to think, sir.
Why are you here, Yates?
You were ‘ involved. ’
Correct.
Is that correct?
Four years, sir.
My father was a winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor, sir.
Oh, right.
- [Snickering]
- Crusade?
- Correct?
Does three months sound better?
- I guess.
You asking me to be your snitch, sir?
Isn' t it a little late in the game to be self- righteous?
- How many times you gonna ask?
- Well, when?
- [Inmates Clamoring]
I said back off now!
Let' s get on!
You guys, we don' t have much time.
And that includes me.
The only difference between you and me is I know I' m guilty.
So we' re packed away here as prisoners.
And one thing is certain.
Our captors have the power.
They can try to humiliate us.
They can beat us.
They can lock us away in a dark hole for days on end.
But there' s one thing they cannot do.
They cannot take away from us who we are.
- [All]
Yeah, that' s right.
It is the one thing -- It is the one thing that gives us a chance in here.
And that nobody can ever take away.
- Yeah, that' s right.
- [Inmates Agreeing]
The Uniform Code of Military Justice.
’ Grounds for Removal of a Stockade or Disciplinary Barracks Commander: - ‘ One.
- [Inmates]
Yeah. - ‘ Two.
- [Inmates Murmuring Agreement] - ‘ Three.
Noncompliance with procedural rules.
Making false official statements. ’ Five.
Conduct unbecoming to an officer and gentleman.
Yeah! ’ Six.
Cruelty and maltreatment of persons under his command.
’ Seven.
Command failure resulting in loss of control of facility. ’
Gentlemen, I propose that we seize control of this facility.
Take a look at a castle, any castle.
Now, break down the elements that make it a castle.
Garrison.
- Forward.
This castle was built to keep people in.
But it' s still a castle.
And any castle can be taken, whether you' re fighting in the 14th century or the 21 st.
To succeed in a castle war, you have to overcome the garrison, take the high ground... and ultimately capture the flag.
Okay?
Enriquez.
You set up a command post, okay?
And here, you have the guard -- Well, here.
Winter' s office, guards.
Phase one, neutralize Winter' s guards.
Control the towers, you control the yard.
Tower one, tower two, tower three, tower four.
Tower four is Zamorro -- guy to watch.
Phase three, water cannon.
Four, helicopter.
Helicopter' s the high ground.
But it' s doable.
Finally, the flag.
When we capture the flag, it' s raised upside down.
- Right.
Right.
We raise it upside down, and keep it that way until Wheeler arrives and sees it.
- Then, we' ve won.
- [Chuckles]
Yates, shut the fu -- You see what I mean about him?
Hey, Yates, what are you doin 'here, huh?
He invited me.
General, I know, uh, his father served with you in Vietnam, but do we really need him around?
He stays.
- Yes, sir.
Yates.
Got a minute?
How am I doin '?
Five- to- two, in the colonel' s favor.
He knows too much.
He may be prepared, but he' s not ready.
You know, we can use you.
Hey, look, I just want to survive this and go home.
- What?
Go to you.
- Listen, man.
- But so do I.
- Oh, yeah?
Well, I know what you' re capable of.
- Is that right?
Is that from your infinite years of experience on the battlefield?
Can you get me out of here?
- Then what are you going to do for me?
Oh, you' re going to make me a soldier again?
You gonna teach me to salute?
You know what?
This is about the time I would be giving you my internal soldier speech.
But the truth is, you probably never should have been a soldier.
Your father was.
That' s how I saw him.
You saw him as a disappointment.
That was then.
The only thing that matters here is... what we are now and what we do now.
This man is going to you because he sees the worst in you.
He' s going to play for the worst.
That means there' s no middle.
Now, these men need you.
Now, it' s your choice.
And don' t tell me you' re surviving here, Yates.
- You' re hiding.
- [Scoffs]
How are you?
Sir?
Prisoner Yates wishes to have a word.
Give me five minutes, Captain.
- [Door Closes]
Hi.
- Hi.
- [Ringing]
Colonel Winter' s office.
Yeah, go ahead and just send it up.
Sir.
- Yes.
Prisoner Yates.
You want me to do this thing for you?
This 30 days -- This three months, it' s not gonna cut it.
I got to get out of here tomorrow.
I' m afraid that' s not possible.
Look, when this thing explodes, everyone' s gonna know it' s me who yakked.
And then my life' s worth nothing.
So, either you get me out of here immediately... or you find another guy who knows as much as I do... and who' s willing to spill it.
Good luck.
The soonest I can get you out is one week.
I won' t last seven seconds let alone seven days.
Well, you can ride the week out in the hole.
No one will get you there.
So what does Mr. Irwin have planned for us?
He' s planning to take over the prison.
Really.
Well, that information won' t get you released.
That information won' t even get you extra potatoes at lunch.
I know the details.
I know how he plans to neutralize your men, how he plans to take over the tower, weapons and tools he' s building.
- [Cutbush]
Yates, I know you' re in there!
- Yates!
Yates, I know you' re in there!
- [Guard]
Cutbush!
You are gonna snitch!
Cutbush, shut up!
Cutbush, get down!
Shut up!
Niebolt, what' s he doing up here?
Enough!
No one sees him.
- Yes, sir!
- What' s the problem?
I' m trying to get a furlough.
- Get him out of here!
Captain, with me.
[Exhales Sharply]
Oh, Jesus, man.
Now you have no choice, or you’ re going to spend the next three years in solitary confinement.
I need more time.
I got to go back into general.
I' il know somethin 'tomorrow.
Come get me at 0500.
I need more time!
March!
- Where' s Yates' cell?
It' s 340, sir.
You ready to play?
- Fallout.
Colonel?
Colonel.
Good morning.
Good morning.
So, what do you have for me?
- Not much.
Then why are you here?
I thought there was something you might wanna know.
When they take over the prison, they' re going to fly the flag upside down.
- It' s the international sign of distress, sir.
Yes, I know what it means.
And where are they going to get a flag?
Yours.
Mine.
- I took it, you murdering fuck.
I thought you were smarter than that.
Yes, I know you did.
You gonna tell us where that flag is?
Come on.
Where' s the flag?
[Spits]
You know, you' re a real fuckin 'coward, Zamorro.
And you' re a big hero.
Come on.
Get your hands off me, motherfucker!
Fuckin 'prick!
Shut up, Yates!
- [Buzzer]
- [Man On P. A.]
All inmates on the rack.
This is a shakedown.
Go, go!
Let' s go!
All inmates proceed to the yard through the south ports.
Move it!
Go, go!
Move it!
Over there, sir.
Step it up!
Move it, prisoners!
- All right!
Captain Peretz, you will find my flag.
6: 1 0.
6: 1 0.
You have your orders.
Find the damn thing.
Sir, they found a lot of weaponry.
- No, sir.
But at least we have all their weapons.
There' s nothing much they can do now.
How many men do we have searching the tiers?
Pretty much everybody we could get.
He wants to be in the yard.
Get our men out of the tiers and into the yard now.
- Everybody into the yard!
Double time!
Now!
- Yes, sir!
- [Speaks, Indistinct]
Chain, chain, chain.
All right.
How' s it feel?
- Bring him with us.
To the hole!
Command post up, fast!
You know what' s going to happen to you?
- Let us out!
Hey!
Beaupre, is that you?
- Is it happening?
- Yeah.
Damn it!
They chained the doors to the tiers.
I can see that.
It' s gonna take 'em a little while to get around.
When they get here, tell them to gear up, but hold them.
They' il expect us to come hard and fast, so we won' t.
- Whoa!
Hey!
I bet against you and it cost me a whole stash of smokes.
Yeah?
There' s a lot of losers today.
- Go!
- [Gunfire]
- Come on, Zamorro, you motherfucker!
You fucking believe this guy?
Let' s go.
- Later, later.
The colonel said to hold them, okay?
Hold them.
[Sighs]
Sir, maybe we should call C. A. C. and get General Wheeler.
And say what, Captain?
Colonel Winter has lost control of his own prison?
- Keenan!
- Yes, sir!
The trajectory is going to be there.
Where do you want me?
This is Sergeant McLaren from Fort Truman Prison.
Can I speak to General Wheeler?
Well, you' re gonna have to wake the dude up, man.
This is from Colonel Winter.
We' re having, like, an uprising here.
Go.
Launch when ready.
Go, go, go!
Come on!
Light her up.
Light her up.
Fire!
Sir.
Colonel, he wants to talk to you.
- Him.
Yes?
Colonel, I' m taking command of your prison.
Like hell you are.
Stop fuckin 'around!
- [Irwin]
Dellwo.
- How close to ready?
- [Gunshot]
We' re almost there, sir.
Sir, could- could you come here, please?
That thing right there tucked away in the alley.
I don' t know.
- Release the wave.
- [Men Yelling]
Come on, come on!
Go ahead and deploy red and blue teams.
- Let' s go!
Move!
- [Men Yelling]
Defend!
Lock and load the fucking thing now!
Light her!
Fire!
Bring me the gun!
Let' s go!
Load her up.
Charlie, you ready?
Fire!
It worked, man!
Fire!
Mr. Dellwo.
Ten feet forward!
Ten feet forward!
- Zamorro, target the man loading rocks into the trebuchet.
- McLaren?
Do not let him put another one in.
Dellwo, you gonna make it this time?
- Then now is the time.
Airborne!
Hey, Jack!
Get it!
This one in the middle.
- Fire!
Get it in there! Last one!
- Makeitcount!
Makeit -- - [Men Screaming]
Put it out!
- You never can tell about these flames, man.
Told you I was gonna get your ass back, motherfucker.
[Chuckles]
Sir.
Sir.
Watch the window.
Get that water cannon now.
Duffy?
- Uh, just a few more minutes, sir.
Fall back!
Faster!
Cut it off.
- Keep it going!
- [Groans]
Let' s shift to the C. P.!
Go!
Duffy, what are you doing?
Yes!
- Charge!
- [Men Yelling]
Shit!
- You coward motherfucker, Winter!
- Colonel, it' s your private line.
- Get it.
- U. S. M. C. F. Colonel Winter' s office.
Please hold.
It' s General Wheeler.
We' re on our way, Colonel.
There in 20 minutes.
I don' t understand, sir.
You sent for help.
I nev --
We have the situation under control, sir.
- [Wheeler]
Good.
We' il see you in 20 then.
Very good, sir.
Get them airborne.
[Engines Whirring]
[Helicopter Whirring]
Okay.
Aah!
Come on, man!
All right, give me the grapple!
- [Speaks, Indistinct]
Where' s the fuckin 'water?
Now.
We' re hooked!
- Yes, I know.
- Hold on!
- [Cheering]
Where is he?
What are you doing?
Hey!
I' m going up.
Stop him!
To hell with this rubber- bullet shit.
Come on!
- Come on.
- [Groans]
Oh, no.
I never wrecked one before.
Don' t talk.
Go!
Get out!
Go!
You okay, Yates?
Let' s go.
- Yeah.
[Dellwo]
Let' s go, men!
In formation, now!
On the double!
Let' s go, soldiers!
Let’ s go!
Dress!
Ready... front!
Cover!
The men are assembled, sir.
First and second squad, move out.
Third and fourth squad, move out.
I have authorized the use of lethal ammunition at this facility.
Any prisoner who refuses to obey my commands will be shot.
All prisoners down on the ground, now!
I will give that command one more time.
Then I will fire into them.
Surely, you don' t want that on your conscience, do you, Prisoner Irwin?
All prisoners down on the ground, now!
Wait.
We' il fight on.
It ends here.
Men, get down!
You, too, Yates.
That' s an order.
Now, give me my flag.
It' s not your flag.
What are you doing, Mr. Irwin?
You have lost.
You will not raise that flag upside down!
Get down on the ground or you will be fired upon.
You will not raise that flag upside down!
Designated marksman, open fire.
Selected marksman, open fire.
That' s an order!
What are they -- What are they doing?
Open fire!
Open fire on that man!
What are they doing?
- McLaren, Niebolt, with me!
- Niebolt, stay where you are.
He' s undermining my command!
Don' t you see what he' s doing?
Don’ t you see what he' s doing?
Step away from the flag!
[Gunshots]
Colonel!
Colonel, put the gun down, sir.
Please, Colonel, put the gun down.
- [Gasps]
Colonel.
Sir, it' s over now.
Just give it to me.
- [Breathing Heavily]
Prisoners stay down.
- Hey, Doc!
Go now!
McLaren, get 'em back in the tiers.
’ A ’ team, ‘ B ’ team, move out now.
Hands behind your head!
On your feet!
Hands behind your head.
Prisoners will return to the cellblock.
- He' s bleeding.
- Get him to the hospital.
[Yates]
A great general once said, ’ You tell your men, 'You' re soldiers. ’ That' s our flag.' ’ You tell them, 'Nobody takes our flag.' ’ Raise your flag so it flies high where everyone can see it.
Now you' ve got yourself a castle. ‘
[Steel- String Guitar]
Where the years have gone I have years to go
Workin 'for the man to pay the debt I owe
Well, the time may pass but the truth will stand
When the good Lord shakes this calloused hand
You can call my name It' s time to go
But I' il never be free till it' s chiseled in stone
Ain' t no man gonna carry my load
I gotta be a man and do it on my own
Devil' s in my path and the hound' s on my heel
Have to walk in my shoes just to know how I feel
The devil' s callin 'my name He' s the one who knows
That I' il never be free till it' s chiseled in stone
Chiseled in stone
Well, I keep ongoin 'though there' s no way out
Every stone in my path is a brick in my house
A man' s life is built all along the way
By the things that he' s done and the choices he' s made
Someday they' il call my name I' il have a place of my own
But I' il never be free till it' s chiseled in stone
On the final day when the whistle blows
I can rest my body I can rest my soul
I built my castle in the promised land
It' s made of rocks and stone and like the shifting sands
When they mention my name after I' m long gone
Well, they' il know I' m free 'cause it' s chiseled in stone
Chiseled in stone.
His plans changed.
Robert, you bastard.
- Let' s go, Michael!
- Got you.
Stay here, all right?
Look, we' ve been instructed to bring you in.
Forget this.
- Neither is yours.
- Relax, Addis.
FBI Assistant Director Julio Martin.
We need to talk.
No, make it 2: 30.
- I saw her die.
- You waited seven years to tell me?
- Then why are you here?
I don' t have a choice.
I have a situation and you' re my only option.
Sit in the corner.
You' il be joining an FBI transnational special task force.
Make it 2: 30.
She took us by surprise.
Sir?
Do the honorable thing, Agent Curtis.
Take the gun.
Put it against your head.
Pull the trigger.
Based on our tests, we have 28 hours left.
Robert Gant?
This is Gant' s latest acquisition.
He' s been trying to build a perfect assassin.
Totally undetectable.
Last week, the place was torched.
And the prototype?
- Ecks, this is Special Agent Harry Lee.
- We pulled that from a traffic cam.
Gant' s son.
- No idea.
- No, sir.
- Get down!
- Why is she standing there?
Move!
Disable target!
We' re on it.
Get her!
- Who' s manning the assault vehicle?
Get out of here!
Get down!
Cover me!
Stay back please, sir.
I know about that job you pulled in Berlin.
Who' s the woman?
- What the hell are you talking about?
She knows where your wife is.
Over here!
My nose!
- I didn' t touch her.
Suggest the locals take this one.
Bitch.
They can' t be hard to spot.
Drop your weapon!
I just want my wife.
Shit!
We may have another problem.
Where is she?
What' s your hurry?
Don' t let them cancel each other.
Going green for a quarantine.
It' s not polite to stare.
So my daughter wanted to know why you look so sad.
You know, Ecks, Martin didn' t want to do it.
Use your wife as bait to get you back in the game.
Bullet missed his heart by about a centimeter.
She doesn' t miss.
Nothing.
Who' s running the task force now?
Nobody.
Get your hands above your head!
We have her online, sir.
You broke profile.
He could die if we don' t get it out.
You did.
Tell that to your wife.
- You' re making a mistake.
- I don' t know.
- You' re lying.
- Do they want money?
This should have never happened.
Shit!
We need to talk.
- We' re running out of options.
Sever helped him escape.
Can I ask why this man is so dangerous?
You know how it works.
- Oh, God.
- Trust me.
Less than 1 2 hours.
Hello, Vinn.
Jeremy?
I am taking a deep cover assignment.
Then don' t.
This is what I do.
Why did this have to happen to us?
Gant had an agenda.
Not with him.
Michael?
He' s our son.
He was the only piece of you I had left.
Jeremy!
But I was wrong.
Hey, listen to me.
I found you.
- I see you found your wife.
Yes, my son.
And by the way...... l' m the bitch protecting him.
Air One to Command, we have target in sight.
How do you know about Michael?
But you weren' t.
Of course.
Who' s that man?
I am Jeremy.
And Sever?
You just lost my wife.
I didn' t set this in play.
You did.
It should never have gotten this far.
I had a family.
This is the way our world is.
Only killers and victims.
- Take her out.
- Yes, sir.
Get down!
Go!
Shit.
Agent Clark.
So you rise from the ashes with a license to do whatever you want.
It' s what we do.
Come on, Jeremiah.
You' re standing pretty close...... Gant.
I guarantee you won' t walk away from this one.
Run!
- Ross.
- Sever.
One big happy family.
Hello, my love.
- What are you doing?
Gant.
You' re still here.
He was about to do something to Michael.
It was never about Michael.
- What are you talking about?
He stole it in Berlin.
You sick son of a bitch.
Give me your hand.
It' s not here.
Where is it?
Ask her.
This is.
We gotta get out of here.
Move!
Joe...
Nobody else needs to die.
Tommy.
- Bill!
- I' m out.
Goddamn you, Joe Enders.
No!
Raise your right hand.
Jap Ha- Go.
Come on.
You boys wanna be codetalkers.
Show me some brains.
{y: i} Chay- da- gahi.
Tortoise.
Good.
Artillery.
Code word?
In code.
Private Whitehorse.
Very good.
Japanese Zero.
Code word?
KANEOHE BAY US NAVAL HOSPlTAL 1943
We can go!
We can get outta here!
Joe.
Didn' t hear a word, did you?
I' m getting better every day.
Joe...
Marked improvement.
And his left ear is the worse of the two?
TBYhasn' t got the range of the TBX.
So you may need a relay to get your transmission to command post.
Victor, Victor.
Damn it!
We got a unit under fire!
- Corporal Enders reporting, sir.
- At ease.
Better than you did as a civilian.
Got kicked out of high school.
Some minor problems in boot.
And you made a hell of a stand on the Solomons.
Tough bit of business there, huh?
Yes, sir.
You men on the Solomons were lost to a broken code.
Tell me something.
- Indians, sir?
The Corps has developed a new code based on their language.
So much so the navy have decided to go to great lengths to protect it.
That' s why you' re here.
It' s a Navajo.
Fortunately, he couldn' t help them even if he wanted to.
Tojo would like nothing more than to catch a live one.
Congratulations.
Fortino, take over.
Listen, I' m Pete Henderson.
Not cos of my big muscles or anything.
Just north of Hollywood a ways.
Jap sons of bitches shot me right in the ass.
So, your duty with JASCO have anything to do with these Navajo radiomen?
Me too.
Hell of a thing, huh?
They look pretty normal, I guess.
Tell him I say hello.
We all got thumbs up our asses.
I been hearing "next week" for a month.
Next year' d be all right with me.
Look at that.
- Fuck it.
I' m out.
What, Injun poker?
You want to come on over, or what?
Cut me in.
How' d you know I was a chief?
Beautiful.
We ship out tomorrow morning.
Kill me some Japs!
We' re gonna be sniffin 'out enemy positions, coordinating the naval gunfire - exactly what we' ve been training to do for the last four months.
There' s a Private Whitehorse...
and Yahzee... and a couple of sergeants, Enders and Henderson, who, if I' m understanding these orders correctly, will be covering our Navajos' asses.
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!
Sounds like you' re dying.
Not what I meant.
Listen, Enders, I' m a codetalker.
Remind me to time you when you got bullets flying over your head.
What the hell' s wrong with you?
Of United States Marines
And call me in the morning.
- Why not?
Well... to war.
THE JAPANESE ISLAND OF SAlPAN JUNE 16, 1944
Let' s go, let' s go, let' s go!
Charlie, come on, come on, come on!
Come on, keep up!
Come on!
- You' re good.
Stay on my ass.
I told you to stay on my ass!

Go!

You sons of bitches!
Whitehorse, get down!
Pappas!
Tank!
Let' s go, boys!
Keep up the fight!

Enders, get the navy on the horn and tell 'em to dig out those guns.
Target reference... dog one... right 700.
Elevation zero- five- zero.
Relay the damn coordinates!
USS CALlFORNlA
Is it English?
Target reference, dog one, south 700, elevation zero- five- zero.
Let' s go!
Harrigan!
Torch the box!
Goddamn it!
You hear me?
We flank left.
Smoke and cover.
I can do this.
Shit!
Make sure they have the new password.
It' s 8am, Sunday morning.
Nell, you' il give yourself an ulcer, you keep worrying about her.
- Ain' t that the truth.
That' s cos they' re all in Daytona Beach.
Yeah, me and Molly, oh boy.
Now I' m on Saipan with this giant Zippo strapped to my back and I' m roastin 'human beings.
You' re goin 'home.
Don' t thank me till you' ve tried it.
Maybe they know our orders.
That' s it.
I know what kind of slanty- eyed savage you are, boy.
I might just take you for a Jap.
You gonna let me get dressed, Chick?
Go ahead, try again.
Chick!
I' m Navajo, of the Bitter Water People, born for the Towering House clan.
Out here huntin 'salmon and shit.
Navajo believe, until a body' s given a proper burial, the spirits stay near it.
I' m telling you I won' t freeze up again.
Because your buddy smeared ash on your forehead?
That' s an order.
My dad, he... he gave me this thing.
I know I ain' t gonna get you to quit playin 'that thing, so...
All right, you lead off.
Over.
What do you mean, light?
Over.
He' s got a mind of his own.
- Not really.
Let' s go!
Take it off!
You' re not hit.
- Move!
- I can' t!
The radio' s out.
Son of a bitch!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Nellie!
Corpsman!
He' s my responsibility!
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I' m the servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
You shall not pass!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools!
What is it Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Mordor.
It' s just where we cant get.
Let' s face it Mr. Frodo.
Mr. Frodo?
I don' t usually hold to foreign food, but this elvish stuff is not bad.
What' s that 'orrid stink?
Can you smell it?
We be very nice to hobbits, you be nice to us.
We swear to do what you wants.
We swear...... to serve the master...... of the precious.
The Ring is treacherous.
- Get down!
We let him go he' il throttle us into our sleep!
Yes.
Aragorn.
Hurry!
No food... no rest and no sign of our quarry but what bare Rock can tell.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us, come!
We dwarves are natural sprinters.
Rohan, home of the horse- lords.
Legolas!
The world is changing.
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman...... and the union of the two towers?
Forests will fall.
We now have only to remove those who oppose us.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch the living of Rocks.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes mum!
I don' t wanna go, mama!
Rohan, my lord...... is ready to fall.
Théodred!
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
Grimá.
Orcs bearing the white hand of Saruman.
What was the promised price, Grimá?
Ho!
They run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
Get the fire going!
What?
Yeah!
They' re flesh!
Get back!
Looks like meat' s back on the menu boys!
Let' s go!
No one' s gonna save you now!
Pippin!
Blood has been spilled this night.
What news from the Mark?
Speak quickly!
I' m Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
The Uruks are destroyed.
But there were two Hobbits.
Do you see two Hobbits with them?
They will be small.
I am sorry.
May these horses bear you to better fortune than the former masters.
Look for your friends, but do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
It' s one of their little belts.
We failed them.
They crawled.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here...
The belt!
Run!
... into...
Fangorn?
Did we lose him?
Merry!
Treeherder!
Shirefolk!
The White Wizard will know.
See, see!
It' s a bog!
Swamp, yes, yes!
Come master.
We move quickly!
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don' t use it.
Swift and quick like shadows we must be.
All rotten.
Or hobbits go down to join the dead ones...... and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Don' t follow the lights!
Are you alright?
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Gollum, Gollum.
Call me heart and hand and bone.
He said your life was was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead when sun has faded and moon is dead.
Hide!
They will see us
Wraiths!
This forest is old.
Very old.
Gimli!
Aragorn, something is out there!
The White Wizard approaches.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits.
Show yourself!
You fell!
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...... I fought him, the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last, I threw down my enemy...... and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Stars wheeled overhead...... and every day was as long as a life age of the earth.
Oh yes.
War has come to Rohan.
That is one of the mearas...... unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
My home.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us that are left to manage them.
Master says show him the way into Mordor.
I did.
Master!
He is up to something.
Yes.
And then...... a tunnel.
He' s been true to his word.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld
My lord, your son...... is dead
Uncle?
He must have died sometime in the night.
Oh, but you are alone.
The walls of your bower closing in about you
So cold.
This place is as cheerful as a graveyard.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Oh.
My Lord.
A herald of woe.
A just question my lord.
Late is the hour...... in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Your staff.
Wait.
You did not kill me...... you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine!
23. 976
Damn it.
We were headed for Junction 21 like you ordered.
- The readings don' t make any sense.
- They read like Sentinels.
- ls that possible?
Hang on.
- What is that thing?
- Some kind of tunneling machine.
- How?
So did l.
Goodbye, Jue.
- Very.
- I hope it gets where it' s supposed to go.
- No, you never do.
- Goodbye.
Thadeus.
[ENGLlSH]
{y: i} You have selected historical file "number 1 2" - "1."
{y: i} In the beginning, there was man.
{y: i} And for a time, it was good.
"But humanity' s so" - "called civil societies..."
{y: i}... soon fell victim to vanity {y: i} and corruption.
{y: i} Then man made the machine {y: i} in his own likeness.
Coming through.
{y: i} Thus did man become the architect {y: i} of his own demise.
{y: i} But for a time, it was good.
{y: i} The machines worked tirelessly {y: i} to do man' s bidding.
{y: i} It was not long before {y: i} seeds of dissent took root.
{y: i} Though loyal and pure, the machines {y: i} earned no respect from their masters... {y: i}... these strange, {y: i} endlessly multiplying mammals. -- "hearing the prosecution' s" {y: i} closing statement... {y: i}... in what' s expected to be "the final day of the B 1" - "66ER trial."
"B 1" - "66ER."
{y: i} A name that will never be forgotten.
{y: i} For he was the first of his kind {y: i} to rise up against his masters. -- "which that instrument" {y: i} provides for and secures... {y: i}... to the citizens of the United States.
{y: i} On the contrary, they were, {y: i} at that time... {y: i}... considered as a subordinate "and inferior class" --
{y: i}... the prosecution argued for {y: i} an owner' s right to destroy property.
"B 1" - "66ER testified that" {y: i} he simply did not want to die.
{y: i} Who was to say the machine, {y: i} endowed with the very spirit of man... {y: i}... did not deserve a fair hearing?
{y: i} The leaders of men were quick to order "the extermination of B 1" - "66ER..."
{y: i}... and every one of his kind {y: i} throughout each province of the earth.
{y: i} Androids and liberal sympathizers flooded {y: i} the streets of the nation' s capital today. -- "threat of violence to make good" "on the legacy of B 1" - "66ER."
Die, bots, die!
{y: i} Banished from humanity, the machines {y: i} sought refuge in their own promised land.
{y: i} A place the machines could call home.
"And they christened the nation Zero" - "One."
"Zero" - "One prospered."
{y: i} And for a time, it was good.
{y: i} The machines' artificial intelligence could {y: i} be seen in every facet of man' s society... {y: i}... including, eventually, {y: i} the creation of new and better Al.
{y: i} If you need the flexibility of a helipod {y: i} with the speed of an air jet... {y: i}... look no further!
{y: i} Versatran.
{y: i} The Human Nations' credit rating {y: i} is falling like a stone...
{y: i} With headlines like that, "the markets have no choice" -- {y: i} But the leaders of men, {y: i} their power waning... {y: i}... refused to cooperate {y: i} with the fledgling nation... {y: i}... wishing rather {y: i} that the world be divided.
{y: i} The world community of nations cannot "tolerate this kind of flagrant deception" --
-- "today approved initiatives" {y: i} for both economic sanctions... {y: i}... and a naval blockade as a means "of containment and isolation of Zero" - "One."
{y: i} At the United Nations, they presented {y: i} plans for a stable, civil relationship... {y: i}... with the nations of man.
"Zero" - "One' s admission to" {y: i} the United Nations was denied.
{y: i} And man said, "Let there be light." {y: i} And he was blessed by light, {y: i} heat, magnetism, gravity... {y: i}... and all the energies of the universe.
"The prolonged barrage engulfed Zero" - "One" {y: i} in the glow of a thousand suns.
{y: i} But unlike their former masters {y: i} with their delicate flesh... {y: i}... the machines had little to fear {y: i} of the bombs' radiation and heat.
{y: i} So the leaders of men conceived {y: i} of their most desperate strategy yet.
{y: i} Lt. Gaeda, please report {y: i} to the Op Center.
At 0800, {y: i} prepare to move out!
{y: i} Charlie Company, prepare to move out.
{y: i} Put on your spiritual armor {y: i} to stand against the wiles of the devil.
Operation Dark Storm initiated.
{y: i} Thus would man try to cut {y: i} the machines off from the sun... {y: i}... their main energy source.
{y: i} May there be mercy on man {y: i} and machine for their sins.
Kill them all!
{y: i} Kill them all!
{y: i} Give us some more artillery.
-- "9 o' clock," "near Mike Johnson' s" --
{y: i} Keep firing, keep firing!
No!
My God, help me!
{y: i} The machines, having long studied "men' s simple, protein" - "based bodies..."
{y: i}... dispensed great misery {y: i} upon the human race.
{y: i} Applying what they had learned {y: i} about their enemy... {y: i}... the machines turned to an alternate {y: i} and readily available power supply:
{y: i} The bioelectric, thermal and {y: i} kinetic energies of the human body.
{y: i} The machine drawing power {y: i} from the human body... {y: i}... an endlessly multiplying, {y: i} infinitely renewable energy source.
{y: i} This is the very essence {y: i} of the Second Renaissance.
{y: i} Bless all forms of intelligence.
Hand over your flesh, and a new world awaits you.
[ENGLlSH]
Just killing time.
You want to spar?
Maybe.
Even if that life was just an illusion?
Finally starting to warm up.
Listen to me.
It' s all right.
So, what?
Come on, be serious, Duo.
I really thought you' d be with me on this.
What do you mean, it' s all been settled?
Stop it.
You know I' m right.
We know the truth now.
Don' t be afraid to look into your heart.
- Tell me.
You' re the one that' s running away!
I' ve had enough!
They' re on their way.
Operator, please!
Relax, you' re okay.
He' s just a simulation.
It was a test.
Concentration.
High scores on everything.
[ENGLlSH]
{y: i} A case to end all cases.
{y: i} You know what I mean, Dinah?
{y: i} But there' s nothing cool left to it.
Wait.
lf it' s another suspicious husband, I' m out of this business forever.
- Hello?
- "Mr. Ash, I have a job for you."
{y: i} I' m looking for a computer hacker.
{y: i} That' s all we know.
Fine.
- "I can' t say."
{y: i} I didn' t get a good feeling {y: i} about the case.
{y: i} So I knew I could get that close.
{y: i} I had a few tricks up my sleeve {y: i} for getting to hackers.
{y: i} While I was searching, {y: i} I found something strange.
{y: i} And their investigations had all been, {y: i} shall we say, troubled.
{y: i} One of the guys killed himself.
Trinity doesn' t exist, man.
He' s not real.
He' s a figment.
A jabberwocky.
"Chessboards, jabberwocky", {y: i} Red Queen.... {y: i} I started searching {y: i} all the usual hacker hangouts...
{y: i} Hacker bulletin boards, {y: i} anonymous mailboxes, chat rooms.
{y: i} And it was in one of those {y: i} that I picked up Trinity' s trail.
{y: i} "Six brooks."
{y: i} "I' il be there at 2005."
Of course!
Hey!
There' s a difference, Mr. Ash, between a trap and a test.
You were testing me?
You made it.
Flattery will get you everywhere.
Mr. Ash, dream of having an eye exam lately?
You' ve stepped to the edge of the looking glass.
Go!
This is really crazy.
What are you doing?
Well, I' ve gotten out of worse jams than this.
What' s happening to me?
I' m sorry.
... l could go with you.
Everything that happened, Trinity, it was all my fault.
I' m old- fashioned.
Yuki!
Yuki?
I' m gonna have to call you back.
Yuki?
Yuki!
She likes to stay home.
- Are we going?
Come on!
Where' d you go?
Sit!
Hello?
Where is everyone?
Stupid cat.
What' s happening?
What' s going on here?
- Yeah!
Yuki? ls that you?
There you are, Yuki.
I' ve been looking everywhere for you.
Bet you' re hungry, huh?
It' s those boys.
"Banzai!" Yes!
No fair.
I think he' s right.
- Don' t look at me.
- I didn' t tell her.
- No way.
That, that was -- What was that?
Anybody home?
Yeah, they' re gonna tear it down.
Hey, light as a feather.
I wanna try!
Hey, hey!
Yuki, wait!
Get out of here!
Yuki!
Where are you?
Yuki!
Yuki!
Yuki.
{y: i} Where is she?
Hey, you!
You don' t belong here.
{y: i} Go about your business.
Let go!
I' m going, I' il see you guys later.
- Yeah, nothing.
[ENGLlSH]
{y: i} Think you can handle them?
Okay.
- It' s quite a catch.
Will it --?
To convert is its choice to make.
No.
So dreaming lets you know reality exists.
No.
Looks like we are too.
Dreaming already?
He' s had a rough day.
Would you mind?
Hello there.
Sentinels.
{y: i}... must posses a rare degree of intuition, {y: i} sensitivity and a questioning nature.
Your muscles are about to burst!
Listen to me, there are 5000 different reasons why you shouldn' t --
That' s enough already!
Over!
You may run, but if you push yourself any more...... you' il be lucky to break nine minutes!
It' s just not worth it, buddy.
No one will ever beat my record.
What?
Hey, Dan, you got a second?
- Always.
It' s everything I' ve worked for.
And now I' m just hoping I can get back there again.
Someone once said it feels like zero gravity.
I mean, especially considering what happened.
{y: i} American Dan Davis is down!
Do not let him wake up.
I' il tell you something...
She always bakes me one when I visit.
She taught me so many things.
We' d go to Broadway musicals, to the movies.
But, when I go visit, she still bakes me her cherry pie.
Something about biting into it, just for that brief moment tasting perfection.
Anyone can write a novel, but no one can beat her cherry pie.
He will never run again.
He will never walk again, for that matter.
[ENGLlSH]
Mr. Popper, what is my policy on ringing phones in the classroom?
{y: i} Get out.
You are in serious trouble, Mr. Popper.
Neo, I believe.
This is not real.
This world must have been a cold and alienating place for a boy like that.
It' s called denying reality.
He' s gonna make it.
I didn' t save you, kid.
You saved yourself.
To those who loved this world once before and spent time with its friends, Gather again and devote your time...
Look at this!
Found it.
... kinda gross, isn' t it?
I' m counting on you, Reno.
Alright, yo.
Senpai, hurry up!
Who is that?!
Elena!
G- go!
It is the source of all worlds and all of the life on those planets.
But that wore away at the life of the planet...
Shinra tried to use force... against those who stood in opposition.
Jenova' s cell, and buried her.
And then finally came to hate everything.
Shinra and those who stood against them.
There were many battles.
There was sadness in the sheer number of battles.
One who I loved also became part of the Lifestream.
The world' s power itself stopped all of the battles.
These things all happened two years ago.
OK.
But... the world... seems to have been much, much angrier than anyone believed.
(Geostigma)
What' s going on?
Please don' t take Denzel away.
He' s not here anymore~
Where are you...?
We' il deliver anyth...... who is this?
I remember you, yo.
Cloud... have you been doing OK?
Is that big brother' s city?
No way.
Don' t cry, Loz.
Look, it' s big brother.
Where' s Mother?
Big brother' s hiding her, isn' t he?
Mother' s really - there -, isn' t she?
Don' t yell about it.
I don' t wanna talk to you!
Give me the boss.
A new oil field!
He seemed a little weird, though...
Uoryaaaa~~
Just as I expected, yo!
Rude, you' re so cool!
Just as expected, would- be ex- Soldier.
Your skills are as impressive as ever.
Is that you, Rufus?
You' ve got no luck either...
Just before the buildings crumbled...
We at Shinra have a big debt to repay to the world.
You don' t have to worry about it.
Those people who attacked you...
Why did they attack me?
So, we decided to try and hire a skilled bodyguard.
Would- be...
Well, don' t worry about that.
You don' t want to bring smiles back to their faces?
Our ultimate goal is the rebuilding of this world, Cloud.
We' re rebuilding the Shinra Company, yo!
Reno!
Looks like it.
What?
Is Cloud sick too?
He thinks he' s going to fight them by himself.
Tifa?
Let' s go home, Marlene.
I want to see Cloud!
... I guess you' re right.
Hey, what should we do when he gets here?
Agreed!
This time I' il be honest with you.
I swear it.
Then swear it on these.
We have to have it, for Reunion.
And yet we...
Until we find Mother and divide up here cells...
Not for the real Reunion, you see.... what are you talking about?
Boss... you' ve figured it out, haven' t you?
You wanna be a Soldier?
Wanna play?
I see, you don' t want to.
Where' s mother?
It stinks!
There' s no one here!
Then let' s play.
This should be fun!
Tifa!
It' s not here.
I' m not crying.
I' il bring it.
Time to finish this.
Run!
You' ve got Geostigma too, don' t you?
He says he' s gonna cure us.
Tifa?
Tifa!
Who did this?
Someone I didn' t know.
Marlene?!
Dammit!
You were heavy, yo.... you were living with some kids, right?
It' s empty.
That OK?
I...
You' re so annoying, yo.
Brother was hiding it, huh?
The power born from the Lifestream.
These Materia will give us a new power...
Reno and them are searching...
It' s Geostigma... isn' t it?
It' s alright if I die.... is that what you' re thinking?
As I thought.
Why don' t you fight it with us instead of running away?
I can' t save anyone, I don' t think.
No one.
Drifting, drifting....
Drifting, drifting!
There was a witness who saw them being taken away, yo.
A power to fight against this planet... which hurts the people living on it.
Actually, you all have this power.
That' s right.
We' re all siblings.
Chosen siblings... who inherited Mother' s cells that were absorbed in the Lifestream.
The planet is trying to interfere.
It' s trying to stunt our growth!
That' s why our bodies hurt and our hearts seem to give up.
I' il cure you.
We' il bring our family' s power together and get back at the planet!
Denzel!
Denzel!!
So you showed up.
I' m sure this will be a good thing.
Question!
Why exactly did you come here?
I... wish to be forgiven.
Yes, I want to be forgiven.
By who~?
This guy is our Brother.
Cloud!
You really can' t save anyone, can you?
What' s happening?
I come here a lot.
So I saw Kadaj and them here.
It seems that the cause is an overloading of the system to remove parasites in the body.
It fights against the invasion of harmful substances.
Jenova' s cells...
You know a lot about it.
It seemed that they had been put through some hideous torture.
Torture?
And the Mother that Kadaj' s gang is searching for is...
Hmph, I don' t want to think about it.
Denzel and Tifa, they...!
Do you have it?
I can' t believe it!
I can' t approve.
The fight is going to begin now.
The Forgotten Capital.
Ajit.
Take care of it.
Don' t run!
They might be somewhere that we can' t get them back.
You go to Ajit, yo.
Have we lost to our memories?
But... we just let her die.
Why don' t you forgive yourself?
Can sin be forgiven?
Tried it?
Tried it...
Marlene, we' re going home!
I' il try it.
I' il let you know how it turns out.
How' s work going?
If it' s OK, I' d like to help, so I' il contact you again.
That' s plenty right there.
Why are you doing this?!
Denzel!
Denzel!
What are you doing?
This... what is it?
You don' t have any faith in us, huh?
Uorya~~
Tell me one thing.
Just one thing.
What did you mean by that?
He... will return.... Sephiroth.
So you hear?
Poor spirit...
I' il do anything if Mother commands it.
As long as you guys are here, the same thing will keep happening.
It comes and goes in the space between life and death...
It is inevitable that history will repeat itself.
We will obey the fate of life.
I' m... beside myself in anticipation.
Then, shall we go ahead and end this?
Denzel, you have to run!
Uoryaa~~
It' s no use...
I don' t want to look.
Not at all, yo!
You guys are really stubborn, yo.
I told you, if you just give Mother back, that will be the end of this.
What are you planning to do with Jenova' s head?
This Reunion or whatever, are you serious?
We just want so see Mother.
She' s our Mother, but she' s going to decide everything now.
So, where' s Mother?
Don' t call Mother that!
... sorry.
Wait, why are we apologizing?!
Tifa?
You bastard!
Barret!
Huh?
I can' t match this!
Ugh.
Damn them!
Who' s that?
The new version of Sierra!
I' il let you ride it later!
Where' s the phone shop...?
They' re all friends.
Right.
Huh?
Maybe i wore it down by dragging it along so much.
I' il be waiting with Marlene.
Cloud, you' il come back too, right?
A little late there!
What should I call out next?
Figure it out, you who lack filial piety.
Go, Cloud!
There you go!
Haiya!
Nuoo~
Fly!
Not done yet!
Here!
Mother!
Boss!
Hey, pal.
Is this thing powerful?
So you made it...?
You like that, don' t you, pal?
Guess there' s no overtime today, yo?
Mother...
Mother!
Let' s go, Cloud.
I was finally able to meet mother!
What' s going to start now?
Mother will tell me.
... the spirits don' t know anything, huh?
I' m just a marionette, after all.
Just like... the old you!
Cloud, I brought you materia!
Hurry and let us down!
That guy' s a spirit of Sephiroth. ‚ ‚ ¢‚ Â‚ ÍƒZƒtƒBƒ\ x8DƒX‚ ÌŽv” O‘ Ì\ x81E\ x81E\ x81E
Bug?
Let' s leave them alone.
He' s honest.
I' il show you my Reunion.
It' s been a while, Cloud.
You lost your Geostigma?
The spirits of the deceased who carried the Geostigma...
As Mother did before me, you see.
What will happen to this planet?
Sister?
I don' t want to tell you.
I thought of what to give to you as a gift...
Shall I give you despair?
Kneel, and show me your figure, begging for forgiveness.
What is most important to you?
Would you give me the happiness of stealing it from you?
I pity you who understand nothing.
There is nothing that isn' t important!
Stay there for me, trapped in memories.
I won' t become a memory.
Kadaj?
Huh?
Let' s stop working so hard...
Mother?
Let' s go back with everyone, shall we?
OK.
See?
Thank you.
Let' s all go home together.
We can all have fun together.
Cloud!
Cloud' s going to come back too, right?
Mother...?
How many times is it that you called me Mother now? ‰ ½“ x– Ú‚ ©‚ È • ê‚ ³‚ ñ‚ Á‚ ÄŒÄ‚ Î‚ ê‚ ½‚ Ì
Isn' t it nice to be yearned for?
I don' t need a kid as big as this one!
Your place isn' t here, I' m telling you.
Cloud will come here, she said.
Welcome home.
I' m back.
There are still kids who have the Geostigma.
Yeah.
Alright, now we' re getting you cured.
It' s all right now.
Try your best.
It' s cured, it' s cured!
You' re all right now, aren' t you?
Yeah.
I' m not alone.
In the Year 2026
Archaeologists working in the Nevada desert discovered a portal to an ancient city on Mars

Field cams, up and running.
People, this room is a code red which means no one gets in without a permission...... it stays at all costs.

Bullshit.

Geez!
If they left shit like this going around?
They died on some accident when he was a kid.
She followed in their footsteps and he didn’ t.
I know I should’ ve told you.
I didn’ t figure this is a thing I can judge down on a yearly birthday card.
- Bullshit!
Notice anything?
- My molecular genetics is a little rusty.
- What' s the first thing dad taught us to look for?
- Humans only have 23.
Her cells divide 50 times faster meaning she heals almost instantly.
They’ re just naturally superiors.

Dr. Carmack it’ s me, Samantha.
Where are they?
I’ m not gonna hurt you.
- Oh, damn!
Duke, get him to the infirmary with Dr. Grimm.
Anything trying to get away from us will get driven straight to you.
He' s messed up, huh?
He tears off his own ear?

Shut it.

Portman, you need to shut the fuck up!
That' s not what we saw.

- Yes, sir.
Mac, I want you to arm Pinky with a weapon...... with some ST grenades and seal the Ark door.

Ark secured.
We' re not calling in backup?
Are you serious?

It' s too late!
You know, I mean how lucky can you get?
I think you mean wonderland.
Cutest thing in the world.
I haven' t even mentioned all the fury yak' s smell.
You know once you pick the hairs out it' s very nutritious.
It' s at the bottom of the mountain.
You want to go to the village?
Ever since that kid came in, you have ignored everything I said.
So now the truth comes out, doesn' t it?
What about me?
I' m sorry that we stuck out here.
Nice, quiet in the pole.
Sorry, George.
You can' t just... 3 knots...
Finally.
Sullivan was twice scarier than you ever be.
Sullivan!
Let' s get you home.
Finish him off!
Mike?
But I am now.
There can' t be any witnesses.
Somebody' s got to take care of you, you big hairy ball.
lf you are not going to tell what' s going on right now.
We are through, you hear me, through!
Idiots!
Hurry up!
Attention employees.
We' ve got to find Boo' s door and find a station.
Oh, boy!
Don' t look down!
I' m going to be sick.
No.
Just do it.
Come on.
We' ve got to find another door.
Look.
There he is.
Hurry up!
Just slide.
I' m right behind you!
Come on!
Keep moving!
Mike?
Great job, buddy.
Get it up there.
Sulli, what are you doing?
Sulli!
Boo!
You stupid pathetic waste!
You' ve been number one for too long, Sullivan.
Now, your time is up!
No!
Alright.
Mama, the alligator' s got in the house.
Oh, no!
Alright, I' ve got a move here.
You know, you still need her to laugh.
Funny, right?
What' s happening?
Hold on!
I have one thing to say.
Catch!
Stop him!
Wait.
He has the child.
Give me the child!
Open this door.
Don' t do it!
Don' t go in that room!
But kidnapping children?
You know what?
You have destroyed this company.
The energy crisis will only get worst... because of you!
Attention!
Hello, boys.
You' ve intercepted that child, Mr. Sullivan.
Go grow up.
You know...
He' s a happy bear.
And I don' t want to see any paperwork on this.
Now we can the rest the day off.
You idiot!
They are going to shut down the factory.
I' m telling you, pal.
When that wall went up, you should have Waternoose' s face.
Come on, pal.
We did it.
Not to mention that the angry monster will come after us... when there is no more power.
Testing.
The best three years of my life.
Of my life?!
Baseball is the best.
Oh, yeah.
Alright.
Remember to tip your waitresses.
Great job, Mikey.
You are such a charmer.
Come on.
Alright.
She was locked away in a castle guardet by a terrible firebreathing dragon.
She waited in the dragons keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true loves first kiss.
Beware
I think he' s in here.
Hold on.
Do you know what that thing can do to you?
He' il groan into your bones for his brains.
Well actualy that would be a giant.
Now Ogars, huh, they are much worse.
They' il make a supe from your freshily peeled skin.
They' il chew your livers, squize the jelly from your eyes.
Actually, it' s quite good on toast.
I warned you!
Yeah!
Fairytail creatures.
Right, this one is full.
Next. - Come on.
This cage is so small.
You wouldn' t turn me in.
I can change.
Next.
This little wooden puppet.
I' m not a puppet, I' m a real boy.
Five shilings for the possessed toy.
- No!
Well, I' ve got a talking donkey!
Well that' s good for ten schilings, if you can prove it.
Oh, go ahead little fellow.
He' s really quite a chatter box.
You boneheaded donkey!
I have heard enough.
Guards!
- No, no, I swear!
- He can fly!
- He can fly!
- That' s right, fool!
Now I' m a flying, talking donkey!
You might have seen how fly, maybe even a superfly.
But I bet you ain' t never seen a donkey fly!
Get him!
Ogar.
By the order of lord Farquaad.
Oh realy?
Can I say something to you?
Incredible.
Are you talking to...... me?
Can I just tell you that you were really great back there with those guards.
And then you showed up and BAM.
That made me realy good to see that.
Really.
But I...
You and mean green fighting machine.
Oh, a, that was realy scary.
Maybe you don' t mine me saying.
If that don' t work, your breath will certainly do the job done.
Man you' ve...
Man I had some strong gases leaking out of my but that day.
I' il tell you why.
My problems have all gone.
But you got to have... - Stop singing!
Wow!
Only a true frend would be that trully honest.
Take a look at me!
I' m an Ogar.
Doesn' t that bother you?
- Really really.
Man, I like you.
What' s your name?
Shrek?!
You' ve got that kind of:
I like that, I respect that, Shrek.
Oh, it is lovely.
It' s amazing what you did with such a modest budget.
I like that boulder.
That is a nice boulder.
I guess, you don' t entertain much, do you?
You know I do to.
That' s another thing, we have in common.
Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face.
You try to give them a hint and they won' t leave.
Can I stay with you?
Can I stay with you, please.
Of course!
- Please!
You don' t how is like to be concerned like a freak.
But that' s why we have to stick together!
Please!
- But one night only.
No!
We can stay up late, swap the manly strories.
I' m making waffles.
Oh, a, I guess that' s cool.
You know, I don' t know you and you don' t know me...... so I guess, outside is best for me.
I do like that half door.
Sit by myself outside, I guess.
- I am outside.
This is far from the farm, but what choice do we have?
What a lovelly bed.
I found some cheese.
- How did you know?
Oh, no, no, no...
Where would we supposed to put her.
I live in a swamp.
What do I have to do, to get a little privacy?
No, no!
What are you doing in my swamp?
Move it!
And hurry up, hurry up.
Not there!
- What?
Ok, fine.
Do not get comfortable.
In fact.
I' m gona see this guy Farquaad right now and get all off my land and back where you came from.
You' re comming with me.
That' s what I like to hear, man.
- Well, can I hummer?
He' s ready to talk.
Run, run, run as fast as you can, you can' t catch me.
I' m not a monster here.
- Tell me!
- No, no, not the buttons.
Who' s hiding them?
- Do you know the muffin- man?
- Yes, I know the muffin- man.
- The muffin- man!
Don' t tell him anything!
Mirror, mirror on the wall.
A..., felonious.
- What I mean is a...... you' re not a king, yet.
But you can become one.
Go on.
And here they are.
She likes sushi and hottubbing anytime.
Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for two evil sisters.
Batch leeret number two is a kemp wearing girl from a land of fantasy.
Just kiss hers dead frozen lips and find out what a live wife she is.
Give it up for...
And last but certalnly not least.
Batch leeret number three is a firebreathing dragon, brand new, guarded castle, surrounded by a hot boiling lava.
But don' t let that cool you off.
She' s a loaded pistol who likes Pinacoladas and getting cut in the rain.
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona.
Batch leeret number two?
Or batch leeret number three?
No, no, no.
Pick number three my lord.
Number three.
She' s nice.
She' s perfect.
All I have to do is just find someone...
But I probably should mention little thing that happens at night...
- Yes, but after sunset...
I will meke this princess Fiona my queen.
And Dulock will finally have the perfect king!
Aha, that' s the place.
- Hey, you!
Wait a second.
Look, I' m not gona eat you.
I just...
To quiet.
Hey look at this.
All right.
Sorry about that.
That champion should have the honer, no, no...... the privilage to go forth and rescue the lovelly princess Fiona from the fireing keep of the dragon.
And so on, and so forth.
Some of you may die, but it' s a sacrifice I' m willing to make.
What is that?
New plan.
The one, who kills the Ogar, will be named champion.
Now, come on.
No?
Come on.
Use the chair!
Thank you, very much.
Try the bier!
No.
People of Dulock.
What?
I' m already on a quest.
A quest to get my swamp back!
- Yeah, my swamp!
Where you dumped those farrytail cratures.
All right Ogar, I' il make you a deal.
Exactly the way it was?
Ok, let me get this straight!
- Is that about right?
I don' t get it Shrek.
You know, problem...
You know the whole Ogar trick.
Oh, you know what.
Maybe I could have decapitateded entire vilage and put their heads on plate.
Got a knife, cut open thier spleens and drink their fluids.
A, no, not really, no.
OK, a, Ogars are like onions.
- No.
Layers!
O, you both have layers.
Ogars are not like cakes.
Paffe.
Have you ever met a person and you say:
"Hey, let' s get some paffe" and they say I don' t like paffe.
You tensed, irritating, miniature peace of barden.
See you lather.
You know I think I' ve prefered you...
Do you have a tissue or something, 'couse I' m making a mess.
Whu, Shrek, did you do that?
My mouth was opened and everything.
It' s brimstone.
We must be getting close.
Don' t be talking mr.
And they don' t come of stone neither.
Oh, Shrek, remember when you said that Ogars have layers?
Well, I have a confession to make.
??? sleeves.
Donkeys don' t have sleeves.
- Oh, you can' t tell me you' re afraid of highs.
No, I' m just a little uncomfortable of being on a rickety bridge over boiling lake of lava!
Come on donkey, I' m right here beside you.
Ok?
We' il just hackle this together one little baby step after time.
That makes me feel so much better.
Shrek!
Just let me go back, please.
- But you' re already half way.
- Yes, that!
Yes, yes.
Cool.
Inside.
Oh, good.
Here' s a responsible situation.
Not to mention dangerous situation.
I' m sure he' s meaner then a cow or anything, but they' re scare.
You know what I mean.
I' m sure he' s havyer then a cow...
Two things.
Shut, up.
Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs.
I thought we were looking for the princess.
The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower.
I read it in a book once.
You handle the dragon, I' il handle the stairs.
I' il???.
Those stairs won' t know which way they go.
I' m the stair master.
I wish I had a stair right here right now, I' d step all over it.
- But where is the... - Dragon!
Oh, what large teeth you have.
You probably hear this all the time from your food, but you must bleach yourself, becouse that is one dashing smile you got there.
Oh, sure.
'couse you' re just ricking the feminine beauty out.
Do you have something in your eye?
Man, I' d really love to stay, but you know I' m a asthmatic and
You' d be blowing smoke and stuff.
- Wake up!
I am.
Oh, that' s nice.
This be our first meeting.
Yeah.
Sorry lady there' s no time.
You know, you should sweep me out of my feet.
You' ve had a lot of time to plan this, heaven' t you?
You can residing of a poem to me.
Or something.
Well, can I at least know a name of my champion?
Shrek.
I pray that you take this favour as a token of my gratitude.
But this isn' t right.
Yeah.
What kind of knight are you?
I' m not that emotionaly ready for commitment of a, magnitude.
Hey, that is unwanted physical contact.
Ok, ok, let' s just back up a little and take this one step at the time.
I mean, we really should get to know each other first, you know what am I saying.
Hey don' t do that.
- Yeah.
Head for the exit.
Ruuuuun!
You rescued me.
You' re a...
I' m entirely in your debt.
She called me a noble steed.
Please.
But, how will you kiss me?
It' s destiny.
And then they share true loves first kiss.
You think, wait...... you think Shrek is your true love?
What is so funny?
Of course you are.
Look.
- Now!
You' re an Ogar.
No.
Princess, I was sent to rescue by lord Farquaad, ok?
Good question.
You should ask him that, whan we get there.
Not by some Ogar and his pet.
Well so much for noble steed.
You' re not making my job any easyer.
Well I' m sorry, but your job is not my problem.
I' il be waiting him right here.
Hey, I' m no ones messenger boy, all right?
- I' m a delivery boy.
- You wouldn' t dare.
- Put me down!
Yeah, I' m right behind you.
This is not dignified.
Put me down.
Let' s say that a woman 'diged' you, but you don' t really like her.
Now, how you let her down real easy, so her feelings aren' t hurt?
How do you do that?
Everyone knows what happens when you...
Oh, yeah.
You gona love it there princess.
And what of my groom to be, lord Farquaad.
Well, let me put it this way, princess.
Men of Farquaads stature are in short supply.
There are those who think little of him.
Stop it, both of you.
Yeah.
Tomorrow?
- Shouldn' t we stop to make camp?
That would take longer.
But there' s robbers in the woods.
Come on.
I' m scarier then anything we' re gona see in this forest.
Shrek, we can do better then that.
No, no, it' s perfect.
Homey touches?
Like what?
Well, gentleman I..., good night.
Do you want me to come in and read you a bedtime storry, 'couse I will...
Oh, come on, I was just kidding.
Right.
Well, the stars don' t tell future, Donkey.
Look.
There' s Blodna, the???
Now I know you' re making this up.
There he is and there' s a group of hunters running away from the stag.
Man, there ain' t nothing, but a bunch of little dots.
Hey Shrek.
What are you gona do when we get our swamp back, anyway?
When we' re through rescuing the princess and all that stuff.
There' s no our.
And the first thing I' m gona do is build a ten foot wall around my land.
You cutted me deep Shrek, you cutted me real deep just now.
I think this whole wall thing is just a was to keep somebody out.
- Are you hiding something?
No.
- Why don' t you want to talk about it?
- I' m not talking.
- Donkey, I' m warning you.
Just tell me that Shrek.
Everyone, ok?
- Oh, for 'the love of pit'.
I' m not the one with the problem.
Run!
You know what?
When we met, I didn' t think you' re just a big stupid, ugly Ogar.
Well, there' s a Cabby.
Ok, ok.
I see him, now.
That one, over there?
Again.
Mirror, mirror, show her to me.
You know I like that.
- Good morning princess.
You know, we kind of got of to a bad start yesterday and I wanted to maked up to you.
I mean after all, you did reascue me.
- Shrek!
Better out then in I always say.
- Thanks.
You know.
Well, maybe you shoudn' t judge people before you get to know them.
What are you doing???? for I am your saver.
Hey!
Go find your own.
Can' t you see I' m a little busy here?
I don' t know who you think you are.
How rude that was.
Please, let me introduce myself.
Oh marry men!
Oh, you little...
Shall we?
All the???
Whoa, hold on, now.
- That.
That was amazing.
Where did you learn that?
There is an arrow in your but.
Oh, would you look at that.
Oh, no...
I' m so sorry.
- What' s wrong?
- Shrek' s hurt.
Shrek' s hurt!
- Does anyone know how to handle... - Donkey!
Ok, I' m on it.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Don' t die Shrek.
And if you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!
- Donkey!
- Oh, yeah.
Right.
Blue flower, red thorns.
- What are the flowers for?
- To get rid of Donkey.
- Hey!
- I' m sorry, but it has to come out.
- Would you...
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Hold on, Shrek.
We were just a...
Look if you want to be alone, all you had to do is ask, ok?
That' s the last thing on my mind.
Hey, what' s that?
Yeah.
- I' m worried about Donkey.
I mean.
Look at him.
I' m fine.
And the next thing you know you' re on your back.
You look awful.
- Do you want to sit down?
- You know, I' il make you some tee.
- He' s hungry.
- I' il get the firewoods.
What, where are you going?
- What is this?
- No kidding.
- Well, they also great in stews.
I guess I' il be dining a little different late tomorrow night.
Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime.
Swamp -??? soup, fisheyes???, you name it.
- A, princess?
- Yes, Shrek?
Are you... a...
Sunset?!
It' s very late.
- Wait a minute.
I see what' s going on here.
Aren' t you?
That' s it.
I' m terrified.
Hey, no, wait.
I' m still afraid of the dark.
- Good night.
Look, I' m an animal and I got instincts.
I can feel it.
Besides, even if I did tell her that... well you know.
I' m not saying that I do.
'Couse I don' t.
- Shrek!
- It' s ok.
- Donkey, shhh.
I' m the princess.
You ate the princess.
- Can you hear me?
- Donkey!
I' il get you out of there!
Shrek!
This is me.
- Yeah.
Was there something that you ate?
'Couse I told Shrek those rats were a bad idea.
What do you mean?
Look, I' ve never seen you like this before.
I didn' t know you wrote poetry.
I was placed in a tower to await the day when my true love would rescue me.
Calm down.
Look, it' s not that bad.
But Donkey, I' m a princess.
I have to.
And, well, I don' t really like it, but you may like it, becouse you' re pretty.
A....
Who could ever love a pice of hideous and ugly?
Don' t you see Donkey?
That' s just how it has to be.
Shrek!
Shrek.
There' s something I have to tell you.
You don' t have to tell me anything, princess.
- You' ve heard what I said?
- Every word.
- Yeah, well, it does.
I brought you a little something.
Very well, Ogar.
The deed to your swamp.
Take it and go.
Before I change my mind.
For I' ve never seen such a radiant beauty before.
- I am lord Farquaad.
That is so sweet.
- It' s not like it has feelings.
- No.
I ask your hand in marriage.
Nothing would make...
I' il start the plans for tomorrow we' il...
Why wait?
Let' s get married today.
You' re right.
The sooner, the better.
There' s so much to do.
Captain!
Shrek, what are you doing?
There' s something about her that you don' t know.
- I talked to her last night.
You' re great pal, aren' t you?
I want to go with you.
You' re not comming home with me.
I live alone.
Nobody!
Especially usless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!
I tought... - Yeah.
Donkey?
Not throug it.
That' s your half and this is my half.
Yes, my half.
I get half the '???'.
- No.
You back off!
- Let go, Donkey!
Fine!
I' m not through with you, yet.
- Well, I' m through with you!
Well, guess what?
If I treated you so bad, how come you came back?
They forgive each other!
I forgive you for stabing me in the back!
You' re afraid of your own feelings.
There you are, doing it again.
Just like you did it to Fiona.
Love me?
She was talking about...
Well then, who was she talking about?
No way, I' m not saying anything.
Right?
- No!
What did Fiona said about me?
No one likes kissass.
I hadn' t have a chance to install seat belts, yet.
Go on.
If I' il need you, I' il whistle.
Shrek, wait, wait.
- What are you talking about?
- It' s the line, it' s the line you got to wait for.
And that' s where you say:
- I don' t have time for this.
What are you doing?
- You want to hold her!
- Please her!
Then you got to, got to try a little tender love.
- Chiks like that romantic crap.
Cut it out.
- I now pronounce you... - There they go!
- Oh, for 'the love of pit'.
I object!
Oh, now what does he want?
Hi, everyone.
Having a good time, aren' t you?
Very clean.
- What are you doing here?
So if you' il excuse me.
- And why not?
Oh, this is precious.
It' s propos???
Now kiss me!
By night one way, by day another.
I wanted to show you before.
- Now!
Shrek!
I will have...
All right, nobody move!
Celebrety marriages.
- Fiona?
I love you.
But you are beautiful.
I have told my union brothers to walk.
Get me Jimmy McGinty!

- Give me a cigarette - I quit
- See the game today?
Why, you liar
What a pussy
I' m too old to screw around Let me give it to you straight
I want you back - you already have a coach - I' il take care of it
- Like you took care of me - Now, Jimmy your players all flew home to their castles in their private jets
I' m gonna use replacement players
What' s the matter, Jimmy?
Who did you think was gonna win?
Not a bunch of bitchy millionaires
Come on, Jimmy!
I' m thinking
Hello!
Hello!
We thought we' d skip special teams for now
It' il be tough enough to put together a team in a week
Here' s a list of people I' ve been watching over the years
They' ve all played football, not all of them in the pros
If nothing else, they should be fun to watch
Daniel Bateman, SWAT team officer
Clifford Franklin
That' s why I have you
- Andre got traded and they fell apart
Striker out of Cardiff, now residing in Hell' s Kitchen.
Gentlemen the drinks are on the house!
- Has he kept in shape?
Shane Falco
The same.
- Should be well rested then.
you look like a swordfish I caught once
He hit the deck just like that - you know who I am? - yeah you' re Jimmy McGinty
We met just before the Sugar Bowl
- What' d you lose that by?
- That would be 45
Why are you here, coach?
I found the best guards and a wide receiver even you couldn' t overthrow
- I' m retired - Retired?
The great thing about plankton is, it pretty much keeps to itself
The score
I watched films of your games since the Sugar Bowl you shouldn' t have been trying to carry the whole team that first year your teammates leaned on you and you crumbled
- Is that how you want to be remembered?
If you do well, who knows what' il happen after the strike
Rather than scraping crap off the bottom of somebody else' s toys?
you could be part of something
Football fans, what the owners are doing is absolutely unconscionable
Which goes against our Constitution, the Declaration of Independence...... and the Emancipation Proclamation.
I love you, man!
Where did you learn to catch like that?
- My tight end is deaf - yeah, I know
Oh, horseshit!
Look at it this way, he' il never be called offsides on an audible
- How are you?
I thought you told me he was solid muscle
Why don' t we join the others?
Come on, quick feet!
Case in point, we don' t have a quarterback, do we?
- Fire out of there!
And the only good thing I can say about our offensive weapon is it' s wiry What the shit is that?
- However the hell you say it!
"Wiry"
Holy!
Have you lost weight?
Expert at pushing people around That' s what pass blocking is, remember?
Now get this off of me!
"That' il do, pig, that' il do"
Get this off of me!
- I don' t want any trouble - you hear that?
What' s up?
Is that right, Falco?
No, let us do that
Thanks, guys
Hey, Falco
Go!
Thanks, coach
In practice, we don' t hit the fellows with the red shirts on
Huddle up!
Get used to setting up on the run Move fast, think even faster
What a bloody shambles that was you could smell the stink all the way back in Wales
Ready!
Shit!
- you should be glad he' s on your side - yeah
Could anyone play better?
Show those others boys what they Lack, lack, lack
If I gave you a dollar you could keep most of the change
We think your team Needs a little practice
Roll 'em up in toilet paper Kick' em to the moon!
- That was great, thank you - Thank you
Can you dance?
- Chinese spareribs
If you don' t want it, get the fuck out of here
I' m Japanese, not Chinese
It' s the same difference!
I' m bloody Welsh!
- I' m going to sit with the deaf kid!
- Jesus Christ!
Praise His glory, Nigel! you praise His glory!
I played one game in the pros, I blew out my knee and that was it
Wilkinson!
I knew it! you played for Minnesota, baby!
Oh, my God! you' d have been All- Pro if you hadn' t beat up them cops!
What I had meant to say was "allegedly" allegedly beat up them cops and because a good Christian boy like you would never do nothing like that!
- Look at these yummy little monkeys!
Oh, hey you -- yeah
- Are you Heather and Dawn? - yep, we sure are you don' t know how excited I am that I actually have some girls with dance experience!
Me too, too
So Heather, you were in Cats, which is so terrific --
No, Pussycats you know, the club next to the airport?
No I mean
What?
If you guys have any friends down at the club, would you send them over?
I' m Annabelle Farrell
Didn' t anybody have anything better to do that day?
you should get some help to turn this back over yeah, I was thinking I' d call AAA later or something
- Do you want a lift? - yeah yeah, that would be great Thanks
Why' d you stay in the pocket at practice?
I don' t comment to quarterbacks about style but you need to keep scrambling against Detroit, with Prescott back
My friend' s a cheerleader for Detroit She tipped me
- That was fun - This is great! you live out here?
Here you see that white yacht with the satellite dish?
I' m the old boat next to it, covered in seagull shit
What did you name her?
Phyxsius.
- "Putting to flight"
What' s up?
Just watching the game
On the surface everything looks calm but beneath the water, those feet are churning a mile a minute you' il be fine
Find a way to lead your team Earn their respect yeah
Me?
I' m just another duck on the pond
Coach, can I ask you a question?
- yeah, shoot - Why me?
Make for a hell of a football player
Get some sleep, kiddo you play professional football tomorrow
Welcome to Nextel Stadium, in our nation' s capital.
Detroit bought an entire semi- pro team once the strike happened.
It' s good for you
Some will say that your accomplishments will soon be forgotten, you' re not real players, this isn' t a real team
- DC!
And a last shot for a guy like Falco.
Remember that beating he took from Florida?
One thing we do know is that Falco can take a hit
Well, I' il tell you, he' s sure had a lot of practice at it.
Will the medical trainers please report to the east tunnel?
And now, the rest of the Washington Sentinels.
Let' s go, let' s go!
- That' s where I stand - No, it' s not
What do you say?
Don' t mess with my brother
Let' s go
Come on, get it together!
Is that understood?
Tell me before the huddle starts Okay?
DC Right, Switch 25 Blast --
The left!
Number 16 on the offense!
I' ve seen monkey- shit fights at the zoo more organized!
DC Right pro 424 Tomahawk, on one, on one Ready?
Ready?
I' m coming for you, Footsteps!
Hut, hut!
Come on, Shane!
- N!
- Give me a T!
Eagle over cover four!
All day, blue eyes!
I' m gonna bury your dog!
Champ, champ!
The Sentinels set a record for penalties in the first 3 minutes!
Number 56 on the defense!
Half the distance to the goal!
- That should be worse than a penalty.
Don' t worry about it
Jesus Christ!
What' d you eat, man?
Goddamn!
Okay, okay, okay, okay!
What?
19, I think.
Not on a football field
Break!
Blue 42!
Blue 42!
First down, Washington.
- Was it out of bounds? - yes, on 23
Go get 'em
Nigel Gruffkicks and scores!
All right, let' s go!
This guy is a heck of a player, but I don' t know him.
That' s weird!
No college given, no high school.
- He does fancy work with the ball - Weird
Ready!
Green 11!
It' s Detroit' s ball with only a minute remaining.
I need that ball Get me the ball you need the ball
Are you gonna get me the ball?
I' m back!
- Go sit down now, Danny - Okay
- Falco!
Let' s do it!
- Here comes the pain, baby!
- What are you doing?
Black 32!
- What?
Heartbreaker for Washington.
Washington 10, Detroit 14.
- I read blitz - Bullshit
I read blitz
WFAN, the Sports Fan' s Show.
I got season tickets I can' t give away!
- They' re nobodies.
Kept thinking I could never live Without you by my side
And I grew strong
Why' d you play that dumb- ass song?
Can somebody please cut that bullshit off?
- We did the best we could do - you don' t get points for trying
Let' s face it, boys, we screwed the pooch today
Anyone home?
Did I hear an echo?
you got shit for brains, but you' ve got balls
- Forget about it - Okay
Come on!
Come on, come on!
Let' s play football, bitch!
We are all God' s children here!
"And deliver thee into the hands of brutish men!"
This is some old bullshit!
Can' t we all just get along?
Why are we the only ones in this jail?
That was pretty sweet, you sitting on Wilson' s head, Jumbo
Thanks, Jamal
He wasn' t the only one who kicked ass you the man tonight, Clifford Franklin!
What? you were hiding behind the jukebox Wasn' t he?
- Shit, I was petrified - you were petrified?
- The Lord is by your side - Have mercy
And I grew strong you know I hate this damn song
I learned how to get along And so you' re back
From outer space
I should have changed that stupid lock I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second You' d be back to bother me
Weren' t you the one who tried to Hurt me with goodbye
Oh no, not I I will survive
As long as I know how to love I know I' il stay alive
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces Of my broken heart
But I spent oh so many nights Just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry And now I hold my head up high
Okay, all right
Frankie
- Do I make myself perfectly clear? - yes, sir
Let' s get out of here!
Hey, Shane
What are you doing?
When that' s all over, you know
I was on my way to work Do you need a ride?
Flatter But it runs
you hear about that?
The good news is, you guys got into a rhythm
Apart from that vomiting thing, which was on Sports Center.
- No, I should go
Thanks for coming by
- Cold!
Here, your shoulders
Better
you' re the first player I can remember who cares more about his teammates than himself
That' s something this team' s been missing for a really long time
It was just stupid
Thanks
We only make 50 bucks a game Gotta pay the bills, right?
Mac' s, down on A Street Come in, I' il buy you a beer
No, no, no
- He' s not nearly as lenient as I am - On three, fellas
- We' re the guards - And we protect our quarterback
That' s your ride right there, ain' t it?
I' m a son of a bitch?
Come on, goddamn it, help me!
And wax that motherfucker
Wild yam
No questions asked
Understood?
Last Sunday, I saw a team on the field play as hard as they could to win the football game
But leadership means nothing if we don' t believe in each other
Players spend years together before they develop trust
I' m asking you to do it in a week, not reasonable but these aren' t reasonable times
But a real man
Let' s talk about fears
I' m scared of spiders, coach
Well, I didn' t mean that --
- Damn!
Okay, that' s great, but I' m talking about what scares us on the field
- Bees?
Shit, yeah!
It sucks you right in and even if you scream, you get that muck --
That' s not what he had in mind
- What' s he talking about, then?
And another
And another you try to fight back, but the harder you fight, the deeper you sink
Like quicksand
That' s some deep shit Some deep shit
Anything else?
- Going back to the mini- mart - The shipping yard
The auto plant
A second chance
We all are
It' s just me, dickhead
I tell you, he is really putting a hurt on Falco.
Huddle up!
Huddle up!
Same play, except let Morris by Nobody touch him
Here it comes!
I' m coming through!
Because you get a fat guy spike, and then you get a fat guy dance.
That' s not in the playbook yeah
Maybe we should put it in
Aren' t they?
We' il stretch them right here
Green 95!
Green
95!
Start the ball!
Hold the play clock
False start on the offense
That' s bullshit!
The one girl slapped the other girl on the ass, Jimmy you' re killing me! you want to see mine?
I got something for you
They did it again!
Ray Smith with the interception.
First down, Washington.
- Defense, get out there!
- Let' s go
98 Shake 98 Shake!
Green 99!
Not bad, Falco
Touchdown, Brian Murphy.
Everybody in the stadium knows that an onside kick is coming...... with 55 seconds left on the clock.
No one' s gonna tackle him.
Well, he' s trying to run out the clock.
What do you think?
you just hold it, and I' il kick the bloody piss out of it
What the hell!
I think he' s smoking on the field
He wants to keep his pub, he' s gonna stop blowing some kicks!
I' m telling you, that' s him
It' s good!
The 65- yard field goal attempt is good by Nigel Gruff.
Washington 17, San Diego 16.
- Oh, bollocks!
Come here!
These guys are like us.
Go Falco!
- I love you, Annabelle - I know you do, Alan We' re closed
Sure it' s okay?
Come on in you want a beer?
Since I was five years old, I been sitting on those stools
And then after he died, I took over
Is that you and him?
yeah
Other kids got bedtime stories, I got football stories
He used to talk all the time about the glory days of football
I wish he was here to see you guys play
It' s late yeah
Us babies need our rest yeah, you do
Between the guys on the field and the guys in the bar a girl' s gotta keep her guard up yeah, I imagine yeah
you coming to the game on Sunday?
No, we don' t travel with the team
Can I see you when I get back?
- What do you do here, John?
- You go for it.
But Falco' s been shut down by this defense all afternoon.
But I' il tell you this, all it takes...... is one big play to get him back in the ball game.
And here goes Falco.
Falco scores!
Franklin' s gonna get hit right here
This cup is stuck!
I can' t get the damn cup off! you can do this
It' s one on one Ready?
And Franklin catches the ball!
But Jimmy McGinty is anything but a conventional guy
And McGinty says go for it
Ready!
Washington wins!
Clifford Franklin gets better looking every day
We' re beginning to scratch the surface of the talents of Clifford Franklin
Clifford Franklin has moves even Clifford Franklin ain' t seen yet you showed us a few moves today against Phoenix but it could be a different story against Dallas
The football is like a one- man cold to Clifford Franklin
- What are you up to?
Okay, okay, I got some great news
With a deal I made them swallow, I can' t not take them back
He falls apart when the game is on the line!
21 other men put their faith in you to lead them They' d be heartbroken if you abandoned them before the biggest game of their lives you really are a son of a bitch, you know that?
What are you doing?
We might end up in that situation with Dallas
They like to send their safeties put the pressure on yeah, coach?
Martel crossed
I' m sorry
"Chokes with the game on the line" ls that what O' Neil said?
It' s better for the team, right?
I mean, Martel he is the best The guy' s got it all
He doesn' t have heart you do
Thanks for believing
I just wanted to tell you before you left
I think it' s terrible what they do to you guys
They make you believe that you' re better than you really are
The cruelest thing that they can give guys like you is hope
A real class act
She deserves better you' re a sinking ship Don' t drag her down with you
Come on, boys, let' s go!
Nothing but water left in here Let' s go
Bye, you guys, be careful!
Shane Falco!
Falco!
- Cheers - Cheers
Are you all right?
Bloody hell
Shane' s got something to tell you
Damn right Damn right
He crossed
Martel crossed
I' il be drinking beer on my boat
This is to Shane Falco
To Falco!
Thanks
It appears that the strike is coming to a close
I never thought I' d say this, but...... l' m gonna kind of miss those replacement games.
Ladies and gentlemen, leading your Washington Sentinels today...... welcome back number 7, Eddie Martel.
Go on, boys!
Come on, Martel Get moving, get moving!
- Red 38!

Dallas recovered.
What the hell was that about?
Touchdown, Dallas.
What the --?
- That' s not how I coach - I don' t give a shit because that' s the way I play
Coach McGinty!
Miles and miles of heart
There you have it, in a word, from Coach McGinty...
Washington will need "heart" to get back into this --
This isn' t a track meet, asshole you have to look for the ball!
What are you thinking about?
- I can
Traffic
This is bullshit!
I' il end this right now
I got two Super Bowl rings! you' re no more than a replacement yeah
I can live with that
My brothers, will somebody please get this asshole out of here?
Get your hands off me, you gorilla!
Something Washington...... has not been able to do against Dallas in seven years.
Falco?
He seems to be necking with that cheerleader!
That' s what he' s doing!
Fire him? - you give me strength - you' re late for work
Kick ass, Falco!
What' s all the celebrating about?
That' s why girls don' t play the game, coach
Listen up This time tomorrow, the strike will be officially over
This is what you call an old- fashioned melee
Unnecessary roughness, number 16 and number 34
Who do they think they' re playing here?
Did I score? - yeah, you did it - God, it hurts It hurts!
Don' t be sorry Going out in front of 80, 000 people ain' t bad you finish what you started
White 24!
Blue 15!
First down, Washington.
He' s going to jail
- I' il clear the way - I' m right behind you
First down.
Right on, baby Right on!
Flip 90 Dig, on the center Ready?
Washington is playing like there' s no tomorrow... because there isn' t
Son of a bitch!
Daniel Bateman comes up with a big stop on third and one.
Pat, with 28 seconds remaining, Washington needs a decent return...... in order to give Gruff a shot to tie the game.
32 yards is just a chip shot for Gruff
you all right?
Come on, Shane!
He 's running with it!
Holding!
- I broke my arm
Spread formation
No problem Just rip someone' s head off on this one
Consider it done
yeah, you want it, Brian
Gentlemen
It' s been an honor to share the field of battle with you
We ain' t losing this game
Green 86!
Green 86!
I knew it!
Washington 20, Dallas 17.
Washington goes to the playoffs!
you did it!
These men lived it.
Some say there was no good in him at all.
This is our story.
Much obliged.
Hot off the press, only 5 cents!
Thanks, Mr. Miller.
You go fetch your father.
Pa?
Thank you.
- Michael?
Hello.
- No.
Ice helps preserve the body.
Don' t help me.
- Winner!
- Pay the man.
- Hello.
It' s good to have so many friends in this house again.
Well, it' s just been me and my boy rattling around in these rooms.
But lose one of us, it hurts us all.
I' il tell you what I do remember, though, and Finn will remember this too...... and that' s Danny on the high school football team.
A championship game.
Let' s drink to Danny' s honor.
- Amen.
But he was loyal and brave.
Nearly half my life.
I' m gonna bury my brother.
Then I' m gonna deal with you.
You' il take care of all of us.
Take Mike with you.
He works for Mr. Rooney.
They' re very dangerous.
- You' re just making that up.
We' re just talking to him, right?
Don' t get me wrong, Finn.
Make this easy.
- All right.
I am sorry.
- Maybe you should check yours.
My beloved father throws your undeserving little brother...... the wake of his life, and this...
- What a hideous world this is.
- You think you' re so smart.
What was that?
Jesus.
Not to anyone!
It' s one of yours?
Well, can he keep a secret?
When we had nothing...... he gave us a home, a life.
Yes.
- It' s only a plate!
What' s he doing here?
I' m gonna be late for school.
Is he okay?
Well, you turned out.
You can' t protect them forever.
John' s also made it clear that Finn McGovern' s operation...... will be divided up locally...... among two territories that John will select personally.
Thank you, Jack.
What men do after work is what made us rich.
No need to screw them at work as well.
I' d like to apologize for what happened.
Try again.
- Just give me their names.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Mike.
You gonna frisk me?
- Should I?
I' m not from here originally, but jobs ain' t hanging off trees, you know.
I' m a boxer by trade.
You know, anyone like me, for example?
- Thank you, Mr. Sullivan.
I appreciate it.
Yeah.
- I have a letter for you from Mr. Rooney.
I' m sorry.
I curse the fucking day you were born!
You!
I have to protect you now.
- Boy, take it!
Do not go to Father Callaway.
Go ahead.
- He' s in hiding.
You think sticking a gun to my head is gonna make any difference to me?
Think, Mike.
I' ve done some work for him.
- That' s a good boy.
- Hello, fellas.
So, what can I do for you, Mike?
I will work only for you, and you know I can do a good job.
I do.
All these years, you' ve been living under the protection...... of people who care about you.
So if you go ahead with this, if you open that door...... you' re walking through it alone.
And all that loyalty, all that trust, will no longer exist for you.
Not on your own.
I drove all through the night to see you.
I said not the kid.
Press.
You got it, Mr. Maguire.
Sixteen hundred.
But I know his work.
How old?
What do I do with the kid?
Thank you.
Oh, thank God.
I want you to know we' re okay.
We' il see you soon.
- Hello, operator?
- Slow night, huh?
- Is that so?
Everything except the food?
- You ought to be on the stage.
I' m a salesman.
Machine parts.
Terrible thing.
You listen to me from now on, or you start taking care of yourself.
You never wanted me along anyway.
- Stop it.
It was not your fault!
- Just take me to Aunt Sarah' s.
- Why?
You have to listen to me now, okay?
Or else both of us are dead.
There' s one thing Chicago loves more than anything...... and that' s their money.
They' ve got it in banks all over the state.
We have to find it and take it.
Then I have to teach you something.
Right, it clutches.
Hey, 45 miles an hour, that' s a little fast.
That' s for you.
You really trust me not to say anything?
Always trust a bank manager.
- Thank you.
I am the future.
So don' t you ever talk to me that way again.
No...
What' s his name?
This is Mr. Rance in the bridal suite.
Listen carefully...... because I am in no mood.
Pa, can we sleep in a motel room tonight instead of the car?
Can' t we close the curtains, even for a little while?
- I' m ready.
Yes, sir.
May I ask you to lower your weapon.
All right, all right.
What will you accomplish by interfering with our business?
- It' s all business.
You fail to grasp that.
And you, Mr. Sullivan, have nothing to trade.
No, no, not it.
Pa!
Help us!
Help us!
When are you two heading out?
You don' t see it.
You wanna talk about it?
Take a seat...... if you want.
Me too.
No.
Was I?
And you....
We' re leaving.
Here?
Downstairs.
Men like the McGoverns.
I stood there and helped him kill Finn to line his own pockets.
Now, listen to me.
I tried to avoid more bloodshed.
And now I' m telling you, leave before it' s too late.
Think.
- That may be...... but you are asking me...... to give you the key to his room so you can walk in...... put a gun to his head and pull the trigger.
And there is only one guarantee:
Leave.
It' s the only way.
I understand.
But then Al wants your assurance that after that, it' s over.
The Lexington Hotel, room 1432.
That' s it.
Sarah?
It' s me, Mike.
Smile.
Michael.
Michael...... don' t you do this.
Give me the gun, Michael.
Give me the gun.
I couldn' t do it.
- Pa.
And that was the last time I ever held a gun.
And I guess, in a way, I did.
But I lived a lifetime before that...... in those six weeks on the road...... in the winter of 1931.
When people ask me if Michael Sullivan was a good man...... or if there was just no good in him at all...... I always give the same answer.
"He was my father."
But my fate was different.
Do you still smoke?
Pull your shirt.
- Which compensation?
A message from God.
"Honesty is punished, sucker."
I was a good shot.
Then, I found this job.
- My phone.
The girl was very sexy.
I am lost.
That' s where we are going, too.
The murder must be from the City of God.
Cops are coming!
The place is full of cops because of you!
Asshole!
Whoever kills in my ghetto, dies.
He had issues, Zé.
You showed disrespect!
The snake will bite you, Benny.
- A dirty traitor.
Peace and love?
Gangs.. soul fans..
religious people..
Groovies..
You are not going away with that chick.
Are you going to ruin everything for a bitch?
You wanna die?
I wanna see your ass!
Come on you faggot!
- Is it stolen?
- Rocket will probably want it.
Shake your ass!
Bring it here.
- No.
Call an ambulance!
Who the fuck did it?
It' s your fault bitch!
- Why?
You killed the coolest gangster in the City.
We' re fucked, man.
Let me pass.
- We' il be back.
- Are you going to kill him?
Take it easy.
Let me go.
I' m Zé!
I' m hit.
He asked for it.
I won' t let it go.
- That' s a bad hole.
He came out of nowhere.
You give me a headache, Tuba!
- Get the kid!
If you don' t stay with us, you' re dead.
We' il be partners.
It' s between me and him.
Like the Kid here they are all like robots.
Kid, huh?
Ok, I accept.
- Have you got a gun?
I have something personal with him
Robbery!
We said no killings.
The second time, Redhead saved Knockout
An exception.
It' s party time!
Our Father, who art in heaven... hallowed be thy name...
Knockout' s one bullet was like ten of Zé' s bullets.
He attacked.
I decided to go out.
Without knowing what was ahead of me...
Someone from the City Of God worked at the laboratory.
- You have a good taste, Rocket.
A personal revenge leaded to war.
Not to go to a relative.
The Kids.
One of Zé' s guys kicked me.
- He works.
A year later, nobody remembered how it all started.
I sniff, I killed, I stole.
Manuel Massando also known as Knockout Ned... is at hospital after an attack of Zé' s gang.
Many.
If a person knowns me that' s enough for Zé to kill him.
Knockout Ned believes that the war will continue.
I am the boss and he is in the newspaper!
My name must be somewhere.
Nothing.
- Those are the announcements.
- Do you want to be shot?
We' il show them who is the boss!
How much does it cost?
It is yours.
Everything t hat is in the laboratory is for publication.
- Give them to me.
I' ve got your money.
- What' s the problem?
- And the day?
Yes, or not?
You took the right decision.
There is another problem also.
- Yes.
Maybe I was about to die but I had a camera... and a chance to become a photographer.
Try this.
No.
- In which room am I going to sleep?
Unfortunately, I have only one room.
Redhead was helping Knockout to escape. without a shot.
It can even shoot down airplanes.
I' ve got the solution.
I' il fix it, but don' t get involved again.
Tell him...
We' il eat chicken and for dessert...
I have a gift for you.
I know.
He has to find me first.
Kid, grab the chicken!
- Don' t run away!
Fuckin faggot!
Let them kill each other
Why are you standing like this?
Kill the motherfucker!
Hang on, I' il help you.
- What' s your name - My name is Otto.
Zé' s down!
Cops!
Hands behind your head!
Handcuffs on him.
- Rocket, where' re you going; - I got something to do.
Not you.
- Me, a little.
And The Chinese, he thinks he' s too important.
Where is Giant?
Many died.
If someone thinks that he knows me, he' s dead.
- Where are the police?
Knockout Ned claims that the war will be continued.
Police officers promised to take down... both gangs at the City Of God.
Breaker, breaker one- nine.
Breaker one- nine.
Hello?
And we 're like, "Okay --"
He' s been acting serious and weird.
- I mean l -- I told you what he was like, and --
- Wait, hold on.
- I got a final tomorrow.
- I' m sorry.
Looking at me, as if, you know... he totally thought that he knew me... which he so obviously didn' t.
- I broke up with him.
I was kidding.
I- It' s -- Sorry.
He was arrested again.
- You know our dad.
And I haven' t seen him in almost five years.
So, I' m like driving 200 miles out of my way just to help him out.
Repeat offenders, the unrehabilitated --
I watch American Justice, with your host, Bill Kurtis.
- How' s it goin '?
I can' t get -- Look at you, man!
- Thank you for coming.
- Sign out, please.
Listen, I' m supposed to be picking up a friend.
I just, uh, well, I just wanted to see how you' re doin '... and take you wherever it was you needed to go... because I sorta need to hit the road.
- Wait, what?
Her name is Venna.
You' re fuckin 'her?
Um, she' s always dated guys from the right side of the 'burbs.
You were always left on the sidelines.
Right?
- You don' t understand.
I' il give him a seven- mile- an- hour chance to jump and roll.
You did your mom... a big favor, and she' s happy now.
- Downsizing?
You got a view.
Olive branch.
We' re barrelin 'down on ol' Eye- 8- Oh east away, just wonderin '...
Roger, you got a 40- mile clear shot, 'cept for Jamestown.
Could I please get a better handle than Mama' s Boy?
- No, forget it.
Just say it.
Now, say, uh, "I' il see ya later on tonight, honey."
- You got it. and I' il see your beautiful ass in the P. M.
Candy Cane, come on.
Get him goin '.
- Nice.
Man, this drive, it seems like it' s takin 'forever.
You got him!
- Awesome!
We can' t lose this guy!
- Rusty Nail?
- Damn!
"I' d take off your bra."
Hey.
There' s spaces all over the place.
Where' s your boss?
I want the real manager.
- Can you understand that?
You can disturb me all you want.
I' m just --
You' d best not mess with me.
- You just take care of your own shit.
Candy Cane?
- Shh.
Are you there?
- No.
You' re turnin 'in for the night.
Do you just love prison so much?
- We' re in 1 8.
I mean, you saw that prick, right?
You- You saw that?
Glad to know you' re thinkin 'about me.
You wouldn' t be interested in gettin 'together later, would ya?
I- I thought you were meeting with Black Sheep.
Relax.
Pink champagne.
That as good.
Room 17.
This is awesome!
He totally body- checked me on the way out.
You should call sometimes.
- I' m serious.
That I' m the world' s biggest loser.
I don' t need them.
What are you -- Are you Black Sheep?
What was that?
- Front desk.
It was like a -- Iike a thud.
All right.
Hello?
All right.
Thank you.
What' d I tell ya?
- U h- huh.
- Your brother?
- In the room.
- Next door?
There was a "sitchy- ashun" Iast night.
- What happened?
That' s right.
- Which of you was that?
- No, no.
We never met --
- Ellinghouse.
He was staying in Room 1 7.
Yeah, I met him.
It wasn' t comely.
He was found early this mornin 'lyin' face down... on the highway median.
So, you' re saying that the -- the huge guy is the victim.
You have no idea who might have visited Mr. Ellinghouse' s room last night?
- Is he dead?
You know what I' m thinkin '?
I' m thinkin 'that a little look- see might "refreshify" your memory.
Because you sorry- ass punks thought you' d have some fun.
And maybe he drives a truck.
You!
I can' t believe you told them that... we invited Rusty Nail back.
Bullshit!
No, that' s not what I' m doin '.
It' s the closest thing I' ve got to a philosophy.
- I' m asleep.
Candy Cane?
- Hey, Russell.
It was just a joke.
Apologize.
I have something more powerful than your psychosis.
And the only thing I need to make you go away is to turn it counter clockwise.
You copy that?
- Yeah.
- Okay, just stay cool.
At the tone, please record your message.
When you have finished recording... you may hang up or press one for more options.
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on.
- Go, go, go, go!
And I got a MasterCard.
- Yeah.
No, no.
Are you boys all right to get back to the main road?
Thanks a lot for this, man.
I' ve never felt like more of a pussy in my whole life.
Hey, what kind of range is there on a C. B.?
Well, hey, you know, I think we should get to a phone.
Call the cops in Table Rock...
What the hell is that?
Go!
He' s right on us!
Oh, man, he' s right on our ass!
Is anyone out there?
Goddamn it!
Fuck!
Yeah!
Tree!
Come on, let' s go!
- Shit!
- Shit!
All right!
Come on!
We apologize!
A laugh?
So, where are you now?
Yeah.
Blow off Denver and come home with me.
Listen, I don' t want to tell Venna what happened.
Freak her out, you know?
It' s a big car, you know?
- I' ve had it for a while.
- No.
No, actually, I think the dents add some character.
- Actually, I was talking about Fuller.
- Hey.
My friend Charlotte.
Nice to finally meetyou.
- And you' re definitely goin 'with us, right?
- It was nice to meet you.
- It was nice to meet you.
- I loveyou too.
* Ride on, ride on *
Picking me up.
This is the part where you kiss the girl.
* All the bad things will go *
- Hey, the room' s this way.
Ah, look what Uncle Fuller found.
- Uh- huh.
- Mm.
- What' s your name, sweetheart?
- Excuse me?
Hey, look at me, campus boy.
I owe you one.
- Back on the truck with you, Daisy!
Hey!
Hey, Venna' s great, man.
I mean, that' s what you said.
You' re just -- just hangin 'out, and --
Oh, we never got those last drinks.
Yeah.
Yeah, I' d show you my license, but my hands are full, so --
Just kinda... out there.
How I thought you said there was no girl.
Fuller.
Listen, there -- There isn' t any girl.
Then, what' s she doing in the other room with your brother?
- He' s watching us!
Yeah, just now.
- There' s somebody watching us?
He said, "I thought there was no girl."
And what you were doing... in the room with her, which is an excellent question.
- Just do it!
- How scared am I supposed to be?
He knows we' re brothers.
- then we' re goin 'home!
Something weird happened to us before we picked you up.
- Because of something that we did.
Hey, man, what the hell are you doing?
There were signs spray painted back there:
Signs?
What makes you think they' re for us?
No!
- Why?
I say we don' t open the trunk!
We just listen.
I don' t mean my Candy Cane.
Venna?
- How does he know my name?
Just tell me where we' re going.
No one to claim the body.
And then they cut offt hejaw.
Your roommate?
I want you to go to the State Line Truck Stop parking lot.
- Venna, please help me!
I want you two to head inside.
She stays put.
Just stay up front.
God, I can' t fucking believe we' re doing this.
Billy, come on.
They told me what they did to you, and I' m very, very sorry.
Well, it' s a little late for that, isn' t it?
Well, that' s a lesson your friends are gonna have to learn the hard way.
Twelve cheeseburgers, please.
- We' re not joking, man.
Wait.
- What?
- Wait!
Do you hear or see anything?
Hi.
- He' s not gonna stop.
- He' s not slowing down!
Go!
What the hell is he doing?
- Keep going!
That way!
Go!
Let' s go!
Run!
Turn, quick!
Lewis.
* You' re blue *
Lewis!
Venna.
- Venna?
- Hey, Venna.
- I was sitting back there.
- You let her out of your sight?
- Lewis, goddamn it!
- We' il do whatever you want.
Do not be one minute late.
Lewis, gas tank!
And if there' s any way that you could bring a bottle of pink champagne --
Venna.
Seven miles.
Don' t worry.
Hey, man, we' re runnin' out oftime.
God... damn...
Hey.
- Hey.
- Just take it and turn it all the way off, then on.
- There it is.
We' re gonna get Venna.
* My heart My heart is aching *
Venna?
- I said hold on!
I' m sorry.
- Is this your room?
* It' s where, where where it' il be *
Oh!
- Shit!
Come on.
- Comin 'in.
- We' re comin 'in.
Hello?
- Hey.
- Nice, isn' t it... being on the receiving end?
Look, I' m not kidding.
- No, believe me... you made your point, all right?
We told you that.
Pretending the person that I' m talking to is right next to me.
- What?
Not what you expected, is it?
That' s not what I expected when I came to room 17, neither.
Listening through the wall.
We gotta call the cops.
Yeah, that' s right.
And we sure as hell won' t tell the cops.
Come on!
Aah!
Lewis!
Fuller, where are you?
Fuller?
- Fuller?
Oh, jeez!
Kick it open!
- Watch it!
- Come on, come on, come on, come on!
- Twenty- two' s clear!
Jeez!
- Twenty, clear!
Sheriff' s Department!
- Venna.
Go!
Show me your hands!
Don' t move!
- Lewis!
- That' s my brother in the back.
Get on the ground!
- Stay with the girl!
Pull!
Run!
Jeez!
Oh, God!
Yes, sir.
- Uh, excuse me.
Ice company?
What' s goin 'on?
Breaker one- nine, come on.
How' s that storm lookin '?
Is it rainin 'out there?
* Every drop, yeah Every drop *
Please follow the orange line.
They' re not very pretty pictures.
Do you guys have your own lab, or do you have to send it out?
We have a lab.
I mean, what did he do to provoke all of this?
Births, weddings, holidays...... children' s birthday parties.
People take pictures of the happy moments in their lives.
Someone looking through our photo album...... would conclude that we had led a joyous, leisurely existence...... free of tragedy.
- I' m coming!
- Okay.
Make sure you can see me.
- Hey, Yoshi, how are you?
- We' re doing good, thanks.
Got three rolls today.
- Can I get the address?
What have we got today?
- That' s okay.
- He' s great.
- That' s right, he just turned 9.
There we go.
Got a winner.
- When do you need these by?
Mrs. Levitt has a problem, offer her a free roll of film.
I consider it an important job.
The family photos.
Some people think this is a job for a clerk.
But of course, like most things...... there' s far more to it than meets the eye.
Milky, washed- out prints.
I process these photos as if they were my own.
I wanted them 4- by- 6.
It' s okay, I guess.
- Thanks.
- See you.
Good night, A. J.
Look, this is a great shot.
- I remember that.
This one' s going into the trash.
Oh, my God.
- I' m serious.
These your relations?
Yeah, I got him a camera for his birthday.
And he probably has a girlfriend and a mommy and a daddy who love him.
Listen, Jake...... not everybody is as lucky as we are.
You know?
- Yeah.
There.
- You have to go to sleep, pookie.
I love you.
- Good night.
How do you think we pay for all this?
- All of this stuff.
How?
Do you even believe what you' re saying, huh?
And it' s not about money.
You' re not here.
I' m going to bed.
Who' d wanna hurt me?
That' s good, Dad.
The store has several regular customers.
I' ve never seen a picture of a human being.
The usual, Sy.
New parents go photo- crazy.
- What?
Nobody cares until the shift' s in double digits.
I' m preserving a level of quality for my customers.
He thinks that a plus. 3 shift to cyan is insignificant.
It' s massive.
You need to look again at your place on the food chain.
If you haven' t noticed, this isn' t Neiman Marcus.
Right.
Here you are in the flesh.
You got it.
So is the rest of the family here?
I appreciate that.
Great.
- You really want this, don' t you?
- Gotta go.
I' m sure my customers never think about it...... but these snapshots are their little stands against the flow of time.
The shutter is clicked...... the flash goes off...... and they' ve stopped time...... if just for the blink of an eye.
I existed.
I was happy...... and someone cared enough about me in this world...... to take my picture. "
How much for this one?
The used Band- Aid...... the guy at the gas station...... the wasp on the Jell- O.
People don' t take pictures of these things.
I' il bet your mother' s told you a thousand times.
- Hi, Sy.
Uncle Sy.
- How many prints would you like?
Thank you.
- Have you picked up prints here before?
You work around here?
- I' m in here pretty often.
Good shot.
Jake, visualize where you want the ball to go and drill it.
A little focus.
- I will.
I was sick all the time.
Then I broke my collarbone and had a weird cast...... that kept my arm up like this all winter.
- I fell out of a tree.
- Good.
- Yeah, sometimes.
I guess.
- You sure?
- Okay, Sy.
Listen, Jan, I can' t talk right now.
A little sensitive, maybe, but...
That' s right.
You' ve been doing our pictures for a long time.
You' re kidding.
That thing he says about fear...
I wouldn' t say that.
- What' s with the getup?
I was doing the SRS.
That' s Yoshi.
I told you that when you moved him.
We' re not talking a few innocent math errors.
The problem is the shut- down clicks don' t correspond.
Then it' s probably the reorder counter.
- What did he say?
Really?
- We' re talking hundreds of prints, Sy.
That' s not possible, Bill.
I' ve done the math.
No.
These discrepancies would be enough, but you' re spacing out...... taking 90- minute breaks, creating scenes...
-... giving away free merchandise.
- You can' t do this.
Finish out the week and clear out your locker.
I' m sorry?
What was that address again?
- Sy, are you all right?
I' il have these for you tomorrow.
Thanks, Sy.
I' m leaving early today, Yoshi.
Okay, Sy.
- Really.
Sy, I just wanted to...
Come on.
But if you threaten to extend your violence...... this Earth of yours will be reduced to a burned- out cinder.
Your choice is simple:
He noted in his diary that almost every bird he shot that day...... was taken by snapshot...... meaning a hurried shot, taken without deliberate aim.
Just dropping off some film.
Just a customer.
- No, you can' t still shop here.
- I checked.
There' s no reason to come here other than to fuck with me.
All right, Sy.
You can' t just leave your station unmanned.
- You need to see these, sir.
Motherfucker.
Did he seem upset or agitated in any way?
I was surprised to see him, and asked him what he was doing here.
Can you show me where I can get that done?
Your wife and child, they' re somewhere safe now?
They' re at my mother' s.
I' m sorry.
I' m a little upset.
I understand.
Right away.
3- 2 - 1, that' s a 10- 4.
Could you try a Maya Burson?
- Hello.
- Nina Yorkin?
Is Jake all right?
We actually need to speak with your husband.
I need to talk to Will.
Duane, get him on the phone immediately.
This is an emergency.
I' il put you on hold.
- Mrs. Yorkin?
I know he' s fucking Maya Burson.
I don' t care about that now.
- I want a glass of water.
Room service.
Just a second.
- I' ve got plenty of cash in my pants...
- Shut up!
Let me explain what' s going on here.
I' m gonna tell you this one time and one time only.
- Do you understand me?
Now, get on the bed.
No!
- No.
Please leave a message...
What' s this?
Can' t you stop your sniveling?
This is supposed to look like fun.
Okay.
No touching!
You have to look like you' re having fun, like it' s a game.
Come on!
Smile!
You look disgusting.
Put his thing in your mouth.
This is all pretend!
- I' m doing it!
We spoke earlier.
Right.
- Any word from Miss Burson yet?
Mr. Parrish, this is the police.
The retinal implant is a microelectronic prosthesis...... that can reverse the effects of retinal degeneration.
James.
Let' s find Yorkin.
Check 5 11.
Where is it?
- It' s in the back, rear kitchen access.
Miss Burson?
Freeze!
William Yorkin?
Do it!
Put your hands on top of your head.
If you so desire and cannot afford one, an attorney will be appointed...
Dad!
You have any children?
Just one question.
It isn' t.
But I' m guessing by your answer and that ring on your finger that you are.
And that makes you a very fortunate man.
I can also tell by the way you' ve treated me...... and the way you do your job, you' re a good man.
A good husband and father, a man who appreciates his good fortune.
You would never neglect and abuse your children.
Make horrible demands of your children.
You would never take disgusting, sick, degrading pictures...... of your children doing these things!
You would never treat your children like animals.
Will Yorkin had it all, and he threw it all away.
He is not a good father.
I think I understand now, Sy.
You' re welcome.
Can I see my pictures now?
Sure, Sy.
Thank you.
Mommy' s just a little sad, that' s all.
Don' t be sad, Mom.
His name is Paul Martel.
She sees him during the day.
Stays about two hours, maybe three.
Hey, lady!
Wait!
Calm down!
Just a friend.
I' m the liar?
Fine.
What are you doing?
- That' il make you happy.
Fuck you.
- I know.
- You want me to?
- I want you to fuck me.
Thank you.
Sure.
So do I, at home.
By accident.
She never complained.
Sometimes we go out.
She likes this neighborhood?
More?
- Why would she do that?
Hi, it' s me.
Thanks.
He was great.
Really great.
I' il kiss you good night when I get home, okay?
- It' s all right.
It' s nothing.
- We' il talk tomorrow.
What?
We can move back to the city.
I didn' t know he was married.
My boy has some of these.
Dad!
Who was it?
- Hey, Charlie!
Oh, my darling.
Amen.
Very nice, Edward.
Gather close.
Hello, Mrs. Sumner.
Sorry to bother you on the weekend.
We were hoping to talk to you for a few minutes.
- Can I come?
Stay out here.
About Paul Martel.
God, that' s terrible.
- I told you.
I can' t remember.
Can you be more specific?
Well, maybe you met Mr. Martel.
Maybe you' d recognize him.
No.
- Maybe he liked you.
- Hang out down there?
Never.
I can' t remember the last time I was in SoHo.
- It was Tracy and Sally.
Yep.
- Enjoy your weekend.
I' m just picking up my silk suit for tonight.
- No.
I love these things. ls there any place you guys haven' t been?
The Rosenthals got 795 for their place.
- Sealed bids is how they do it now.
What do you think this place is worth, Ed?
Fiji.
Remember, Jeff, I asked you to take me to Fiji.
And then you took me to Hawaii.
You did, didn' t you?
Talk to me.
- Edward, please --
I wouldn' t feel it?
Honey, it' s okay.
That' s okay.
It' s an accident.
Why aren' t you in bed, Mom?
I want you to know...... that I love you, more than anything in the world.
Come on, sweetie.
3200, 3500, 3800, 4000...... 42, 45, 4800!
We could fish all day.
Edit by Marios007 Helios Greece
I don' t know.
Dad!
Dad!
Bo?
Bo?
Bo?
Hey...
Honey...
Morgan?
Are you hurt?
I think God did it.
Did what, Morgan?
At the movies?
Are you sure?
All right, then.
Bye.
Houdini peed.
I think he' s sick.
Spitting!
Pour it in his bowl.
It tastes funny.
It does not.
Houdini?
Bo, don' t run.
What' s wrong, boy?
Look at where it' s bent over, Father.
It' s not broken.
Can' t be by hand.
It doesn' t sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.
They can' t take a piss without wetting the front of their pants.
I was over at Theo Henry' s farm yesterday afternoon, and he would have mentioned something.
Some animals around the county have been acting funny -- and some of them violent.
I don' t think so, Father.
They' re more edgy, you know, and alert.
Houdini' s sick.
Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers are back.
Yeah, we' il be doing Lee a favor.
It' s just for show.
It doesn' t sound natural when I curse.
No, I' m not.
All right, you want them stealing something in the house next time?
-- 1...
I heard.
Bo had an old baby monitor.
Stop!
Get it off!
Now, what' s wrong with this one?
A hair.
This one?
Stimulating.
You are.
Don' t you think that' s kind of odd?
Probably.
Yes, it was.
How certain are you that this was a male?
I don' t know, Merrill.
She scared a couple of the customers.
Dad, where' s the remote?
I don' t know, baby.
Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you -- maybe a- a church member who -- who might not have liked the fact that you left the church?
It' s just, I' m pretty strong, and I' m pretty fast.
There' s only food under the sofa.
Baby, why don' t you just change the channel on the television?
They died out by the early '80s, dismissed as hoaxes.
But there are so many now.
How could so many people be in on it?
And you take care of yourself...
It' s plain and simple.
I have seen 12 soda commercials so far -- 12!
For Morgan Hess.
I' m just a little scared.
Please, I need to clear my conscience.
Shit, I know you.
Got the bat at home o- on the wall.
'Cause he has another record most people don' t know about.
He has the minor- league strikeout record.
Merrill' s a class- A screw- up.
He would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could.
It' s contaminated.
13!
It' s 71.
Is that understood?
Is that him?
Yeah.
What is it?
They' re, like, 30, and they work up little codes together, and they analyze Greek mythology and make up secret societies where other guys who never had girlfriends before can join in.
You' re wasting your time here!
I' m not gonna report this or anything you do to my crops to the news or TV or anybody!
Mexico City officials as well as U. S. officials have confirmed that these are not aircraft from either government' s air force.
My ballet recital.
The history of the world' s future is on the TV right now.
-- Everything they wrote in science books is about to change.
That' s true.
Group number two sees it as just pure luck, a happy turn of chance.
I' m sure the people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way.
For them, the situation isn' t 50- 50.
But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they' re on their own.
And that fills them with fear.
But there' s a whole lot of people in the group number one.
When they see those 14 lights, they' re looking at a miracle.
And that fills them with hope.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person are you?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
She was just sitting there
So I turn, take out the gum, stuff it in a paper cup next to the sofa, and turn around.
And then she said, "Swing away."
For the kids' protection.
Anyways, they closed the schools.
11: 00 a. m.
It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down.
They found the bird.
They think they have some kind of invisible- shield thing going, l- like an optical illusion.
They' re still there, hovering.
All over the place, over us, even.
Oh, of course.
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
If you' re gonna make fun of it, then forget it.
There are pictures.
Dr. Bimbu, one of the authors of the book --
He said there are two reasons why extraterrestrials would visit us -- to make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe, or the other reason -- they' re hostile.
That' s weird.
Yeah, oh, yeah.
Father?
Don' t.
And it had to be at that right moment -- that 10, 15 seconds when I passed her walking.
It was like it was meant to be.
I' m screwed, right?
People who kill reverends' wives aren' t exactly ushered to the front of the line in Heaven.
Wh -- Where are you going, Ray?
To the lake.
All right.
The startling footage we' re about to show you was photographed by a 42- year- old, Romero Valadarez.
We know all about the hoax.
Ah!
That' s why we couldn' t see them that night.
Uh... in this book of yours... did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
They would use ground tactics -- hand- to- hand combat.
'cause they know eventually we would use nuclear weapons.
How could anyone possibly know that information?
What else did it say?
They said there are one of two outcomes of an invasion.
Sounds made- up.
So... we can choose to believe this lake idea, pack up, and go, or we can stay here, hide inside our home, wait it out.
That' s got nothing to do with this.
I change my vote.
You can' t change your vote.
We' re going to board up every window in this house.
How do we know boards will do anything?
The information we' re receiving comes from our affiliates across the world.
Yes?
I was wrong.
It' s like "War of the Worlds."
I' m going to get back to the windows.
Don' t worry.
Good choice.
Understood?
-- Stop crying!
-- Don' t yell at her!
Graham, hurry.
Your eyes were so big and gorgeous.
All the ladies in the room just gasped.
And they said, "We' ve never seen a baby so beautiful."
They put you on the table to clean you up, and you looked up at me and you smiled.
They' re on the roof.
While they were fixing her up, all she kept asking about was you.
We forgot our foil helmets.
Have we got anything to wedge against the door knob?
You' re scaring your sister.
We' re the same.
What does that mean -- pinned?
The truck -- the truck has severed most of her lower half.
She won' t be saved.
And she doesn' t feel much, and she' s -- she' s talking almost like normal, and we didn' t pull the truck out
And that won' t be very long.
Yes, it is.
Okay?
I' m serious.
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared... but who knows for sure?
I know.
We' d have to be sure before we opened up that door, Graham.
The atmosphere here is cautiously optimistic.
-- They' re dancing.
-- Yeah, like this.
-- I see the same expression on every face.
Three small cities there found a primitive method to defeat them.
We have no further details at this time.
Are you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Is it possible... there are no coincidences?
Merrill... swing away.
Dad?
Yeah, baby, I think someone did.
The devil, Malebolgia, has sent a lieutenant to Earth... to recruit men to turn the world into a place of death... in exchange for wealth and power -- a place that provides enough souls to complete his army... and allow Armageddon to begin.
Like him, I killed in the name of good, but the violence of my life... pulled my soul towards the darkness.
This is the test.
Simmons is the best.
Iike the hero he thinks he is.
We made a deal, Wynn.
When the big pinata breaks, you' il get it all.
P. S...
He' s on his way out.
Same routine, all right?
Guard Wanda.
You want someone filling body bags, send Priest.
You will follow orders and do your job.
- Am l?
It' s up to us to take out the plant... and carefully destroy all the biochemical viruses.
This is top priority.
A town with approximately 8, 000 experimental hosts.
You son of a bitch.
Enjoy your retirement, old friend.
I' m gonna have fun with you.
Hey, mister, you thirsty?
You' ve been gone a long time, friend.
Here, Zack, here.
How much is left remains to be seen.
One... two... three!
Spaz.
Just a freak accident with some Jiffy Pop.
Just get out of here and take him.
Don' t want to keep... that side order of potato salad waiting.
- He knew my name.
You can' t get married.
God, I hate them.
I don' t mind being short, fat, and ugly, but the pay sucks!
Get away from me, you freak.
I' m not done with you yet.
Avenge your murder.
A little death, a little destruction... perfect marriage.
And the winners are Wanda and Terry.
I want you to take care of Wynn.
Oh, come on.
In the name of the people and things of Hell,
I dub thee...
Bite me.
Yuck!
This freak stuff will come in handy... when I get my hands on Wynn.
Easy, friend.
Who are you?
I killed for the kingdom of Saxony 500 years ago.
Or is everyone just back from Hell?
I think the government has been attentive... to the sensitivities of the nations involved.
Director Wynn has been meeting with several world leaders... in an attempt to quell the proliferation... of global conflicts.
Fitzgerald may be a spineless bureaucrat, but he' s doing a great P. R. job for me.
The world is going to Hell in a handbasket.
There it is, Jess.
HEAT- 16.
How do you control delivery of the weapon?
You' re becoming quite a powerful man.
You left me to die in that biochem plant, remember?
Simmons!
Wanda was devastated.
I want you to nail him now!
It' s a little early for Halloween.
You' re right.
Will that be the same or separate checks, lady?
Just when I was getting sick of you whining about Wanda, you do us proud.
So congrats on your first mission.
Where the hell did he go?
Negative, sir!
Always bitching at me --
"Am I going to go to Hell?"
Fun?
He killed Priest!
HEAT- 16 is ready to go.
It better be.
The Spawn' s ready.
He' s just the highest- scoring killer of all time.
I almost forgot again.
That' s a good idea.
When all the world is mine,
Ten thousand people died in the first month... after the disaster five years ago.
Thought I was getting rid of the world' s vermin, and I turn out to be one of them.
It' s up to us to put an end... to the suffering of these innocent children.
Spaz!
I' m Cyan.
You have your mother' s eyes.
My, my, my.
What a pretty little dress.
Spawnie, Spawnie, he' s our man.
"S" to the "p" to the "a" to the "awn."
I had the tenure.
It' s not fair!
It' s not fair!
Excuse me.
You' re not supposed to talk to strangers, either.
I' m not going through this again.
I don' t want to take any chances.
What the hell is going on?
You don' t want to be where I' m going.
You think we eat so good you can just spit up what you like?
Don' t talk back to me.
Let' s increase the flow to 3. 5.
Breathe normally, Director.
Sounds like a country song -- "Take your army and shove it."
You' ve got that "I want to beat the fat little man"...
I' il just have to teach you a lesson.
I' m not the vindicator... or the victimizer... or the vaporizer or the vibrator.
I' m... the violator!
I ain' t staying!
We' re going.
Violator, one, Spawnie- boy, zero.
Twinkle, twinkle, little Spawn.
You' re not excited yet?
"Oh, no.
Oh, please, Wynn, don' t.
Forget Terry.
See you at Wanda' s.
Wynn and Wanda sitting in a tree, s- u- c- k- i- n- g.
Gotcha, Jason.
Your vengeance... their pain.
Let him go.
You' re still letting them get to you.
They' il use it to rob you of any humanity you have left.
Your old life is gone.
Accept that.
You' re playing their game.
I might.
It has trillions of neuroconnections.
So... that' s how it works.
You must visualize your objective.
You' ve a lot more to learn.
Take care of your powers.
Won' t be needing these.
Get out of my way!
I' il get Spawn so worked up, he' il kill Wynn without blinking.
When I' m done with you, they' il change your name to "Stain."
Look, Ma, no hands!
I love the smell... of burning asphalt in the morning!
It' s an honor to be a Hellspawn, you hear me?
That' s not fair!
Open wide and say "Aah!"
See you at Wanda' s!
Christ.
OK, baby.
It' s all there?
I want to get it on tonight' s news.
Hey, sweetheart.
Some unfinished business.
You can' t release the virus.
Only those who refuse to join me.
You' re a very lucky man.
Peek- a- boo.
You were at my birthday party.
You sure know how to raise them.
Of course I am.
You don' t know how much your heart means to me.
All right, Spawn.
So what' s it gonna be?
Time' s running out.
I' ve got nothing else to lose.
Feel the burn.
If you kill me, you kill her!
How could you let him kill me?
Whatever happened to love, honor, respect?
You should have killed him!
Never?
I was counting on Spawn killing you.
But first... first, I want to slaughter each and every one of you.
And then I' m gonna have a little creme de Wanda.
I' il let you watch, too.
Tastes like chicken.
He' il be back.
Come on!
I may not be able to hold him off alone.
Come on down to my world and die, suckers!
Come and get your throat cut.
If you won' t lead my army, then you must die.
Bring me Spawn' s head.
You will never escape me.
It' s all right now, baby.
Come on.
There' s no place for me here.
What if I sided with Clown?
I' d have killed you.
- Thanks, kid.
Concentrate!
Bite this!
Cut off his head!
I' m gonna die!
Are the HEAT- 16 bombs still a danger?
Do you have any further comments?
The documents I release to all media outlets... will answer the rest of your questions.
Natalie Ford reporting live.
Spawn has stopped...
For now.
Is what you' ve got cooked up for tonight any better?
Maybe if I came a little closer.
Think you can do it now?
Why didn' t you shoot again, baby?
- What the fuck are you doing? -... when I couldn' t fire that second shot.
What is that?
What the fuck are you doing?
Just tell me one thing.
Where are the diamonds?
Well, I started in software, ordinateur...... and made some money...... then found out that I was interested in other things.
Like what things?
I went back to school in Washington.
America is a country very big, no?
Yes.
That' s terrible.
It' s okay.
- Could be.
Are you eating?
- You know who Bruce Hewitt Watts is?
- New American ambassador?
- No.
Nothing, except you don' t dodge photographers like you' re hiding.
- You are the best.
- On what, IOUs?
I' m not just your agent.
What' s her schedule?
Shit!
- ls this Nicolas Bardo?
Well, I' m sorry, Mr. Shiff, but it' s already been sold.
Unsell it.
That' s very generous, but l --
You don' t realize who you' re dealing with.
Sir, hold on.
Hold on a second.
This paparazzi scum is wearing a wire.
Make sure it doesn' t get past security.
- Okay.
I' m sorry to bother you, but I rented this room last night...
- Disk?
It' s the only copy I have.
I searched like hell for it.
- Do you mind if I take a look?
You didn' t see a disk, right?
It' s not like a CD or DVD or anything like that.
Oh, my --
That' s not your business.
It' s not, but it is.
Give me your arms.
And relax, relax!
I know.
What word?
Coffee?
- Yes.
Why?
I was safe in the States, but here, it only takes one photo.
Like the one today.
Just stay with me.
I need air, but I don' t want to talk anymore.
I feel like shit, but I have to make some money.
Maybe another time.
I' il be waiting out here, just in case you need anything.
- No, no, no.
Nicolas, take my car...... take my purse...... if you' re so worried that I go somewhere.
I could call a taxi...... but I' m not going to do that.
Hold it.
Well, it' s not mine, but somebody loaned it to me.
This doesn' t make much sense.
So she set me up for you guys, to get me out of the way.
I read a lot of mysteries, and I figure out the endings halfway.
- You check out the hotel?
- Yeah.
So I went to a pharmacy to get her prescription refilled.
That' s correct.
That' s right.
- Why would she want to do that?
Well, her husband was beating her up because she wanted to leave him.
Yes, that' s right.
Ambassador' s wife held for ransom.
You didn' t have time to send the ransom note.
No, no.
I am no kidnapper, sir.
I think this is a terrible misunderstanding.
We do not need or want your investigative skills employed...... to discover why Mrs. Watts was in a hotel bedroom with Mr. Bardo.
- No crime.
But, fortunately, in our country and in yours...... they are not compelled to see us.
Good day, inspector.
You really want to report it stolen?
- lf it doesn' t turn up, give me a call.
Look, Bardo, I know who you are.
I don' t know what you' re up to, but it' s not smart.
"Mr. Watts, if you ever want to see your wife again...... bring 1 0 million dollars in bearer bonds to the Passerelle Debilly...... at 2 a. m. this morning.
Okay, Lily.
What the hell do you think you' re doing, Lily?
Explain?
Lie?
I felt responsible for it!
I' m a bad girl, Nicolas.
Rotten to the heart.
People that don' t forget.
So I went back to the States, where I got everything a bad girl ever wanted.
He had to have public glory.
He gave away a ton of money, bought the ambassadorship...... which meant the little missis got dragged out in the Parisian limelight.
Et voilà.
Enter my worst nightmare.
Blackmailer?
You offered me money!
And I have never kidnapped anybody, you fucking bitch!
I' ve got it all thought out for you.
I' m not gonna tell them that story.
Hold on, hold on.
lsn' t sugar better than vinegar?
What?
- Really?
Maybe Napoleon and I should sail off into the sunset...... and you can go fuck yourself.
You' ve ruined everything.
I was jealous.
Nicolas, you don' t have to lick my ass.
A bad choice.
And you know what it got me?
Because this world is hell, and you' re nothing but a fucking patsy.
Fuck you!
You' re not gonna hurt her, right?
- Don' t do anything foolish, darling.
Watts, it' s Nicolas Bardo.
lf you don' t believe me, I got it right here on tape.
What the fuck do you think you' re doing?
I was just being careful.
Fucking bitch!
You didn' t think I' d give you a gun loaded with real bullets, did you?
Baby...... there' s one more thing we gotta do.
My husband.
Where are the diamonds?
Wake up, bitch!
You know what' s in this?
But if you don' t end it here...... and you get your ass on that plane to America...... your future will be sitting right next to you.
And after that, you' re on your own.
Do I pull the trigger?
Or do you get your ass on that plane...... and have a wonderful life?
How do I know that you tell the truth?
Nick, asshole, it' s Johnny.
- I know who you are.
Maybe they' re camera- shy.
I know it' s weird, but they do.
Four?
Sorry that it took so long, but it was the safest way.
Bye, Laure.
It' s best if we don' t see each other again.
I' m just a little shook- up.
Only in my dreams.
