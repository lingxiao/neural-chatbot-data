Look at that!
I' ve never seen anything like that in my life!
That' s incredible!
That' s terrific.
Specifically, you' re bargaining for the right to stay in a horrible social spectacle.
You' ve served those purposes brilliantly.
Why argue when you can quit?
And you say you want to know why decisions are made.
Your future comfort is assured.
You don' t need to know.
Why argue about decisions you' re not powerful enough to make for yourself?
Energy will treat you well, you know that.
If the rule changes stay, Mr Bartholomew, I' m playin 'with my team.
Too late.
The rule change is scheduled and announced.
You' ve seen to that.
I' il see you in Tokyo.
You can be forced!
You can' t make me quit!
Don' t ever say that!
I can!
You can be stopped!
You could have killed someone!
- It' s all goin 'too fast.
I' m not packed...
- You' re not going, Daph.
Here.
Take this extra hat.
Sir, I' ve had a call.
I have to go over to Energy.
- You can' t go to Tokyo?
- What do you mean, I' m not going?
I hope this isn' t an inconvenience.
No, no, it' s no problem.
I' m supposed to go with you.
Well, what' s that mean?
Who told you you' re supposed to go with me?
Nobody told me.
Listen, Jonathan, I really wanna go with you.
I do really.
You' il need me.
Get yourself another assignment, will you, Daph?
Everybody' s an assignment.
Life' s an assignment.
You better do as you' re told, Jonathan.
That' s all I have to say.
Are you threatenin 'me?
- Don' t be here when I come back.
- You won' t be back, Johnny boy...
Don' t try to frighten me, Daphne, you don' t know how.
You go tell them people that I' m going to Tokyo and you' re not, huh?
You tell 'em that.
Keller.
Make sure my gear gets to the track in Tokyo.
You call Transportation and tell 'em.
Yes, sir.
What chance does Houston have of defeating Tokyo tonight?
Both teams have fine players and different styles.
What do you say, Moonpie?
It' s not an even match, see, because the Tokyo team has all these little short guys!
What about the rule changes?
Well, at Houston, we kinda play a wide- open system.
Will you comment on a game where the rules are always changing?
They don' t affect good teams.
You' re a great new player.
What' s the secret of your success?
Oh, it' s no secret.
I just imitate him and plastic surgery keeps me beautiful.
There are rumours that the last game of the season will be without time limits.
Any comments?
I don' t think it will.
It' s still a game.
Some say you retired from the game.
Here I am.
Corporate society was an inevitable destiny, a material dream world.
Everything man touched became attainable.
I' ve been touched all my life, one way or the other.
Either caressed or hit.
Don' t much seem to matter which any more.
I guess that' s why I wanna see Ella again.
To see if I still feel things now.
You know what I mean?
There are some other things, too.
They took Ella away from me.
Now they' re tryin 'to push me out.
I' d sure like to find out why.
I think I' il go to one of them computer centres.
See what I can find out.
Findin 'out things, that' s...
That' s the thing, Moonpie.
Welcome to Tokyo and tonight' s dramatic semifinal match for the world' s rollerball championship between hosts Tokyo and Houston.
Big rule changes tonight.
There will be no penalties called and limited substitution.
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand for our corporate hymn.
The name of the controller for tonight' s game - CC Nakamura.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I' m all right!
I just wanna get out there and hit them little fellas.
Listen, stay close now, all right?
Yeah.
OK, Johnny.
Let' s go, let' s go!
Attention.
Your attention, please.
Rule changes for tonight' s game:
Limited substitution and no penalties.
The controller checks the computer, ready to fire, and the first ball is fired.
The game is under way.
Remember, there' il be no penalties and limited substitutions.
This will be a punishing game for both teams.
- Here they come!
- Next time around.
Spread out!
- All right, boys!
Go ahead!
Stay close now, stay close.
Stick with 'em!
Go, go, go!
There' s a scramble in front of the goal.
Kubo, on his knees, scores!
Kubo scores from a kneeling position in front of the goal.
And Tokyo takes a 1- 0 lead over Houston.
This is a fast- paced game tonight with Tokyo leading 1- 0.
Houston being pressured by the faster Tokyo team.
The second ball is fired.
- Spread out!
- Slow 'em down!
Spread out!
Now the faster tactics of the Tokyo team.
Their bikers and skaters form a wall.
- Watch the ball!
- Get 'em out!
Bike, bike!
Bike him!
Bike him!
You got him, baby, you got him!
The ball is fired, the second period is under way.
Tokyo leading.
Houston forced to come from behind tonight.
Here you go.
Watch the man behind me!
It is scooped up by Carter for Houston.
Houston on the offensive attack.
Come on!
Right in the slot, through three men and he scores!
Houston goal scored by Jonathan E!
The time - 12. 05, second period.
- I love this game!
- Yeah!
Some injuries here as three players are helped off the track.
- Sprint!
- Yeah, right!
Over here!
Over here!
- What the hell are those guys doin '?
- I don' t know.
Stay close.
I told you to stay close.
All right, turn loose next time around.
All right?
Go on, go on, go on, go on!
Moonpie!
I got him, I got him!
Take it easy.
Everything will be all right.
Sit down over here.
Sit right here.
Everything' s gonna be all right.
Medic, hey, medic, come over here!
Come on!
Moonpie!
- Come on, Moonpie.
- Come on, get some help!
Set him down, set him down!
Just a bit more.
Breathe.
Come on now, Moonpie.
Come on, Moonpie!
Come on, Tokyo!
Go get 'em!
Go, go, go, Tokyo!
Jonathan, watch yourself out there!
Now, watch them!
Keep behind, Blue.
Look out!
Jonathan E!
Time in the third period - 11. 35.
Sprint!
Sprint!
Roll out!
Roll out!
Blue!
This way, please.
May I say first, please, that you played a superb game in our city.
Thank you.
A simple problem, yet I know it is difficult for you.
Your team- mate has no family and permission is required now before consummating matters.
So, he' s technically dead?
Yes, unfortunately.
His heart and lungs will function, but his brain is...
It has expired.
From the first minutes, it was hopeless.
I believe this was explained to you.
He' s warm.
Yes.
But if you will, please, you must sign a release form.
It is required.
Does he...
Does he dream?
No, there is no brain wave at all, no sort of consciousness.
Just a deep coma, a vegetable.
No dreams, nothing.
But even a plant feels somethin '.
Who can say?
Please.
It senses life.
I mean, it turns towards the sun.
- It' s alive, isn' t it?
- You must sign.
You...
You just leave him the way he is.
- Just leave him as he is.
- You must sign.
There' s no other way.
- Arrangements will be made.
- Please!
- There are hospital rules that...
- No, there aren' t.
There aren' t any rules at all.
Let me know if you have any problems.
You won' t find any answers in Geneva.
Take care of your arm.
In my opinion we are confronted here with something of a situation.
Otherwise I would not have presumed to take up your time.
Once again it concerns the case of Jonathan E.
We don' t want anything extraordinary to happen to Jonathan.
We' ve already agreed on that.
No accidents, nothing unnatural.
The game was created to demonstrate the futility of individual effort.
Let the game do its work.
The Energy Corporation has done all it can.
If a champion defeats the meaning for which the game was designed, then he must lose.
I hope you agree with my reasoning.
Thank you all.
Will you follow me, please?
Hello!
Hello!
Yes, it is!
The famous Jonathan E. Hard to believe!
Sorry things are in a mess.
The rollerball champion.
Wonderful!
Not many people come to see us, you know.
We' re not easy to talk to, Zero and I.
We' re a little confused again here today.
This is embarrassing.
It' s embarrassing to misplace things.
You' ve misplaced some data?
Mm, the whole of the 13 th century.
Misplaced the computers - several conventional computers.
We can' t find them.
We' re always moving things around, getting organised, my assistants and I.
But this is Zero' s fault.
Zero, he' s the world' s file cabinet.
Pity.
Poor old 13 th century.
Well, come along now.
You want to get started, don' t you?
Yes, sir.
This way.
Now...
We' ve lost those computers with all of the 13 th century in them.
Not much in the century - just Dante and a few corrupt popes.
But it' s so distracting and annoying.
You' ve unlimited restrictions here, of course, but you' il have to come so, so many times.
It all takes such effort.
Do the executives still come here?
Oh, they used to, some of them.
- What about the books?
- Books, books?
They' re all changed.
All transcribed.
All information is here.
We' ve Zero, of course.
He' s the central brain, the world' s brain.
Fluid mechanics, fluidics.
He' s liquid, you see.
His waters touch all knowledge.
Everything we ask has become so complicated now.
Each thing we ask...
This morning we wanted to know about the 13 th century.
He flows out into all our storage systems.
He considers everything.
He' s become so ambiguous now, as if he knows nothing at all.
Could you tell me about the corporate wars?
Wars, wars?
Oh, yes, of course, we have them all here.
Punic War, Prussian War, Peloponnesian War.
Crimean War, Wars of the Roses.
One doesn' t recall them in sequence, but corporate wars...
Well, Zero will or can, I' m sure, tell you anything.
A memory pool, you see.
He' s supposed to tell us where things are and what they might possibly mean.
Look, Zero.
A visitor.
Jonathan E, the rollerball champion.
You' ve filed away a lot of data on him.
Do you remember?
- Does it answer you?
- Oh, yes, it speaks.
It finds things and loses them and confuses itself.
Ask anything, he' il find it for you, section and lot.
Won' t you, Zero?
All right.
I' d like...
I' d like some information about corporate decisions.
How they' re made and who makes them.
Zero, you heard the question.
Answer him.
Negative.
You don' t have to give him a full political briefing.
- Answer.
- Negative.
This is Jonathan E.
He has to know.
Make it simple.
Answer.
Corporate decisions are made by corporate executives.
- Corporate executives make...
- I know we have the answers.
Knowledge converts to power.
Energy equals genius.
- Power is knowledge.
- I don' t want to bully you.
Genius is energy.
- Corporate entities control elements...
- But you have to answer!... of economic life, technology, capital,
labour and markets.
Corporate decisions are made by...
- You have to, Zero! -... corporate executives.
The 13th century...
- Negative, negative, negative...
- It' s so embarrassing!
Hello, Johnny.
How are you, Ella?
Nervous.
How are you?
I' m all right, I guess.
What are you doin '?
Looking at you.
Counting your scars.
Seeing how you' ve changed.
Oh, you mean that' s how I' ve changed?
Just a little more beat- up.
Oh, no!
You' re just not...
Yeah, well...
Come on.
You want a drink or somethin '?
No, thank you.
You have a lovely place.
Thank you.
Well, I' ve seen your house.
You have?
Yeah.
When we played in Rome, I stood a block away and watched your front gate for a couple of hours.
I was just standin 'there wonderin' what your furniture was like, what you said to each other in the mornings.
What' s he like?
What' s he do, this...?
He' s a city engineer.
We have a jet- copter, a son, two cats and a place in the Alps.
You don' t really want to hear all of this.
- A son, huh?
- Yes.
We have a lot of friends.
And he has a lover.
We have furniture a lot like yours.
How about that?
You know, Johnny, all they want is a kind of incidental control over just a part of our lives.
They have control economically and politically, but they also provide.
Provide, huh?
They were responsible for takin 'you away and I started to hate' em.
But they weren' t.
It was the game, Johnny.
I mean, it was so important to you.
It was as if I wasn' t even there.
The play, there was nothing else.
I' m sorry.
You know I wanted you here.
Well, I mean...
This might sound all wrong, but...
Well, I was just tryin 'to remember myself then.
Yeah.
Maybe it was love I wanted to try to remember.
There' s a lot of things I wanna talk to you about.
Yeah.
I' ve been thinkin ', Ella.
Thinkin 'a lot.
I' ve been watching.
It' s like people had a choice a long time ago between... well, having all them nice things or freedom.
Of course, they chose comfort.
But comfort is freedom.
It always has been.
The history of civilisation is the struggle against poverty.
No!
No, that' s not it.
That' s never been it.
I mean, them privileges just buy us off.
Look...
They want me to quit, Ella.
Then quit.
Just like that, huh?
But you' ve got to do it now.
You' ve got to before it' s too late, whether you want to or not.
Look, Johnny...
And no time limit.
You' il die, Johnny.
Everybody will die.
No time limit.
They tell you that?
Yes.
- They tell you to convince me to quit?
- Yes, but that isn' t why I came here.
You have to get out for your own sake.
Please, Johnny, please.
Did they tell you to stay if I did quit?
Are you my big reward?
You still don' t understand why I came here.
You' re the only person I ever wanted.
I wanted you on my side, that' s all.
It' s like you' re a god now.
Maybe you know what I don' t.
I' ve been so stupid for so long.
I' ve been so stubborn.
I don' t even know why.
It scares me.
I' m probably gonna die.
And you' il be in there pumpin 'away long after I' m gone.
You got it made, old buddy.
Bluebonnets and everything.
Jonathan' s dead!
Jonathan' s dead!
Attention.
Your attention, please.
Rule changes for tonight' s world championship game.
No substitutions, no penalties and no time limit!
Watch now, he' s got the ball.
Next time around we defend.
Come on!
Come on, get outta there!
Get him up.
He did it!
Get him in the elevator.
Get off the rail!
Get him off the track!
I don' t want another man on that track!
Houston, what the hell are you doing?
- Ain' t nobody gonna win this game!
This wasn' t meant to be a game!
Never!
Watch his leg.
Easy, easy!
Let me have him, let me have him.
Let me have him!
Move out.
Move out!

Can I persuade you to take a sandwich?
I' il get drive- through.
You' re counting on the Winged Avenger to deliver you from evil...... aren' t you, my friend?
Are you going to kill me?
Maybe, maybe not.
We' re of two minds on the subject.
Are you a gambling man?
Let' s say we flip for it?
One man is born a hero, his brother a coward.
Babies starve, politicians grow fat...... holy men are martyred, and junkies grow legion.
Why?
Luck!
Blind, stupid, simple, doo- dah...... clueless luck!
The random toss...... is the only true justice.
Let' s see what justice has in store...... for you.
It' s like the touch of God.
Wait, wait, wait.
Fortune smiles.
Another day of wine and roses.
In your case, beer and pizza.
Out of here, guys!
- But you said you' d let me live!
- Too true!
And so you shall!
Nothing' s better than live bait to trap a bat.
Hot entrance.
Two- Face?
Two guards are dead.
He' s holding a third hostage.
Didn' t see this one coming.
We should have.
The Second Bank of Gotham...
Second anniversary of the day I captured him.
How could he resist?
I' m Chase Meridian.
I asked her to come here to consult on the case.
She specializes in...
Abnormal psychology, multiple personalities.
I read your work.
Insightful.
Naive, but insightful.
I' m flattered.
Not every girl makes a superhero' s night table.
Can we reason with him?
- He' s got innocent people up there.
- It won' t do any good.
- He' il slaughter them without a thought.
- Agreed.
A trauma powerful enough to create an alternate personality leaves one...
In a world where normal rules of right and wrong no longer apply.
Exactly.
Like you.
I could write a hell of a paper on a man who dresses like a flying rodent.
Bats aren' t rodents, Dr. Meridian.
Really?
I didn' t know that.
You are interesting.
And call me Chase.
By the way, do you have a first name, or do I call you Bats?
Let' s start this party with a bang!
Very punctual, even for his own funeral.
Boys!
Kill the Bat!
Blast him!
Open sesame.
It' s a trap!
Attention citizens of fair Gotham!
Enough cash to rain down upon fair Gotham, a glorious flood of chaos.
And, of course...... you, my boy, dead!
It' s boiling acid!
For your dying pleasure, we are serving the acid that made us the men we are!
No!
- Yes!
Haul away!
Haul away!
- Give me your hand.
- Don' t let go!
I must borrow this.
That' s my hearing aid!
Thanks.
My shoes are melting!
No more!
Hang on.
Hang on?
Get him down.
Take it easy with him.
Just stay calm.
This' il fix him!
Hang on, Batty!
Let' s see.
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Farewell forever to that...... pointy- eared night rat!
Face!
You need help.
Give it up.
Have the good taste to die!
See you!
Despite a valiant effort last night by Batman......
Harvey Two- Face is still at large and extremely dangerous.
In other news today...... billionaire Bruce Wayne extended his profit- sharing program...... to the employees of the successful electronics branch of Wayne Enterprises.
Mr. Wayne.
Your inspections are a departmental highlight.
Oh, my God, it' s him.
I am a winner.
Bioremediation.
Alternative fuel.
Mr. Wayne, look at that time.
Perhaps we should get to R & D as soon as possible.
Mister...?
Oh, Bruce Wayne.
No, that' s my name.
And you are?
Nygma.
Edward.
Edward Nygma.
You hired me personally.
Just like I tell everyone.
We' ve never actually met, but your name was on the hiring slip.
I need that hand back.
Oh, yes, of course.
I' m sorry.
It' s just that...... you' re my idol.
Back to work.
And some people have been trying to keep us apart.
Back to work.
It' s okay.
What' s on your mind?
Precisely.
What' s on all our minds?
Brain waves.
The future...... of Wayne Enterprises...... is brain waves.
I must apologize, Mr. Wayne.
- It' s okay.
I have it!
My invention...... beams any TV signal directly into the human brain.
By stimulating neurons, manipulating brain waves...... this device makes the audience feel like they' re inside the show.
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world?
Did you say "manipulating brain waves"?
Yes.
But...... someone like you would never need it.
Someone so...... intelligent, witty and...... charming.
I need a bit of additional funding for human trials.
Let me show you, please!
Now, listen...... I want a full set of technical schematics on this, okay?
We' il be full partners in this, Bruce.
Two of a kind!
You call my assistant, Margaret.
She' il set something up.
That' s not...... going to be good for me.
I need an answer now.
I think I deserve it.
I' m sorry, then the answer is no.
Tampering with people' s brain waves...... mind manipulation...... it just raises too many questions.
Sorry.
Thanks, keep up the good work.
The factory looks great.
All right, everyone!
Back to work!
We' il discuss this later!
You were supposed to understand.
I' il make you understand.
Lock.
Chair.
I saw the signal.
All is ready.
Commissioner?
He' s at home.
I sent the signal.
What' s wrong?
Last night at the bank I noticed something about Two- Face:
His coin.
It' s his Achilles' heel.
It can be exploited.
I know.
You called me for this?
The Batsignal is not a beeper.
I wish I could say that my interest in you was...... purely professional.
Are you trying to get under my cape?
A girl can' t live by psychoses alone.
It' s the car, right?
Chicks love it.
What is it about the wrong kind of man?
In grade school: guys with earrings.
College: motorcycles, leather jackets.
Now...
... black rubber.
Try a fireman.
Less to take off.
I don' t mind the work.
Pity I can' t see behind the mask.
We all wear masks.
My life' s an open book.
You read?
I don' t blend in at a family picnic.
We could give it a try.
I' il bring the wine...... you bring your scarred psyche.
Direct, aren' t you?
You like strong women.
I' ve done my homework.
Or do I need skintight vinyl and a whip?
I haven' t had much luck with women.
Maybe you just haven' t met the right woman.
I saw the signal.
- What' s going on?
- Nothing.
False alarm.
Are you sure?
Women.
Now I' ve got it!
"Too many questions.
"Too many..."
I' il show you it works!
What the hell is going on here?
I told you this project is terminated!
I' m calling Security!
Caffeine will kill you!
Rise and shine, little guinea pig.
What are you doing?
Untie me!
This won' t hurt.
At least, I don' t think it will.
What are you doing?
You touch that switch and...
This?
Losing resolution.
More power!
Edward Nygma...... come on down!
You' re the next contestant on...... Brain Drain!
I' il take what' s inside thick skull number one!
What have we got for him?
Oh, Stickley, I' m having a breakthrough!
And a breakdown?
Maybe!
Nevertheless, I' m smarter.
I' m a genius.
No, several geniuses.
A gaggle, a swarm...... a flock of freaking Freuds!
Riddle me this, Fred.
What is everything to someone...... and nothing to everyone else?
Your mind, baby!
Now mine pumps with the power of yours!
"I' m sucking up your IQ
"Vacuuming your cortex
"Feeding off your brain"
What a rush!
What the hell just happened?
A very surprising side effect.
While you were mesmerized by my 3- D TV...... I utilized your neural energy to grow smarter.
Bruce Wayne was right!
You demented, bizarre, unethical toad!
It is brain manipulation!
I' m reporting you to the FCC!
The human experimentation board!
The AMl!
And the police!
You are going up on charges...... to court, to jail...... and then to a mental institution for the rest of your life!
But, first and foremost, Nygma, you are fired!
Do you hear me?
Fired!
I don' t think so.
Help!
Hang on!
Babe!
You are fired!
Or should I say...... terminated?
Surf' s up, Big Kahuna!
Nice form, but rough on the landing.
He may have to settle for the Bronze.
"Questions," Mr. Wayne?
My work raises too many questions?
Why hasn' t anybody...... put you in your place?
Harvey Dent, once Gotham' s District Attorney...... was horribly scarred by underworld kingpin, Boss Moroni.
Dent' s left- brain damage turned him into a violent criminal...... who blamed Batman and who has vowed to destroy him.
Harvey Two- Face is extremely dangerous, repeat, extremely dangerous.
That was the Commissioner.
There' s been an accident at Wayne Enterprises.
Horrible way to die.
The surveillance cameras are down here.
We' il dredge the river, but with that current, I doubt we' il find the body.
Why?
Oh, why?
I just can' t believe it.
Two years working in the same office.
He was like my father...... my brother...... or a cousin that visits a lot.
Get a grip, Edward.
I found this in my cubicle.
You' il find the handwriting matches his, as does the sentence structure.
I couldn' t possibly continue on here.
The memories...
This is last night' s security log.
There' s Stickley.
Pretty cut and dry.
Yes, definitely suicide.
Thanks very much for your help, Bruce.
We' il be in touch.
Stickley' s suicide doesn' t make sense.
I want full benefits for his family.
Suicide' s not covered by our corporate insurance policy.
Full benefits.
Gossip Gerty called 32 times.
Who are you taking to the Charity Circus?
I' il let you know.
What' s this?
I don' t know.
I didn' t see anyone.
"If you look at the numbers on my face...
"... you won' t find 13 anyplace."
That' s hideous.
What does it mean?
It' s a riddle.
"Numbers on my face... 13."
One through twelve.
The answer is a clock.
Who would send you a riddle?
That, Maggie...... is the riddle.
Guess what I did today?
Wayne Manor.
See you soon.
Thank you.
I... guess I' m early.
I have an appointment.
I' m Bruce Wayne.
Good.
Then you can afford to buy me a new door.
I' m sorry.
You... sounded like you were in...
... you know, trouble.
I prefer healthy expressions of violence as opposed to breaking in.
So...... how can I help you?
Someone' s been sending me love letters.
One at my office and one at my home.
Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your opinion.
A clock.
Clock.
"Tear one off and scratch my head.
"What once was red is black instead."
A match.
My opinion: this letter writer is a wacko.
"Wacko?"
Is that a technical term?
Patient may suffer from obsession...... with potential homicidal tendencies.
Is that better for you?
So, what you' re saying is...... this guy' s a total wacko.
Exactly.
He' s obsessed with you.
His only escape may be to purge the fixation.
To kill me.
I think you understand obsession better than you let on.
You like bats?
That' s a Rorschach, Mr. Wayne.
People see what they want.
The question is: do you like bats?
Still playing with dolls?
She' s a Malaysian dream warden.
Some cultures believe she protects you from bad dreams.
It' s silly to you, I' m sure.
You look so sad.
Do you need one?
Why would I?
You' re not exactly what you seem, are you?
What is it you really came here for?
Yikes, time' s up.
That' s usually my line.
I' d love to stay here chatting...
Would you?
I' m not so sure.
I must get you out of those clothes.
Excuse me?
And into a black dress.
Tell me, Doctor, do you like the circus?
Ladies and gentlemen...... boys and girls of all ages...... welcome to the greatest show on earth!
Who is this beautiful young woman you' re with?
Dr. Chase Meridian.
A doctor?
What kind of doctor?... for Gotham Children' s Hospital.
Let' s thank our largest single donor:
Bruce Wayne!
Ladies and gentlemen...... 70 feet above the ground...... performing feats of unimaginable aerial skill...... the Flying Graysons!
Listen...... I' m going rock climbing this weekend.
I' d like to.
I really love it.
But?
I' ve met someone.
That' s fast work.
You just moved here.
You could say he just...... dropped out of the sky and...... bang!
I think he felt it too.
He sure did.
What?
Who wouldn' t?
Now......
Richard...... the youngest Flying Grayson...... will perform the awe- inspiring...... death drop...... without the safety...... of a net!
Let' s go.
You' il be okay.
Ladies...... and gentlemen!
Now, the new management of the circus invites you to forget...... this good, wholesome fun...... and join us in a celebration of absolute chaos...... and true jesters!
Bring it on!
Now!
Tonight, a new act for your...... personal amazement.
We call it, "Massacre under the Big Top."
Let us direct your attention to the ring.
Inside this harmless- looking orb are two...... that' s two hundred sticks of TNT.
And in our innocent hand...... a radio detonator.
What do you want?
Want, Mr. Mayor?
One simple thing:
Batman.
Bruised, broken, bleeding...... in a word: dead!
Batman.
Who do we have before us?
Gotham' s finest...... well- to- do...... influential.
Surely one of you knows who Batman is.
Hell, odds are one of you pasty- faced twits is Batman!
You have two minutes.
Harvey!
I' m Batman!
We can stop them.
Go out on the rigging.
Be careful.
Don' t worry.
Go to work, boys!
Our kind of day.
Reach for it!
Stop it!
Oh, my God.
It' s good you took him in.
He hasn' t anyone now.
He' s filled out papers all day.
He hasn' t slept or eaten.
Welcome, Master Grayson.
I' m Alfred.
How' re you doing, Al?
But perhaps you' d like to eat first.
Okay, I' m out of here.
Excuse me?
Telling that cop I' d stay here...... saved me a lot of social- service interviews.
So, no offense, but no thanks.
See you.
Take it easy.
Where will you go?
The circus must be halfway to Metropolis.
Then I' il kill him.
Killing Two- Face won' t take the pain away.
It' il make it worse.
Spare me the sermons, all right?
I don' t need your advice or your charity.
Nice bike.
Hang out at a lot of biker bars?
You' re almost on empty.
Fill it up in the garage.
There' s no gas station for miles.
The pump' s over here.
Is this a garage or a car museum, Bruce?
That' s a 1917 Harley.
Yep.
Indian Classic, fully restored.
This is a Vincent Black Knight.
They only made a hundred.
A hundred and one, actually.
She' s my favorite.
You' ve got two.
That one doesn' t run.
The throttle sticks on this one.
Alfred' s a good mechanic, but...... these need a lot of work.
If someone were to fix them up...... they could keep one.
Anyway...... have a nice trip.
You' il land on your feet.
Is the young master leaving?
Pity.
I' il just toss this away then.
Perhaps the dogs are hungry.
Hey, Al, wait up.
Master Bruce?
Just like my parents.
It' s happening again.
A monster comes out of the night, a scream, two shots.
I killed them.
What did you say?
He killed them.
Two- Face.
He slaughtered that boy' s parents.
No, no.
You said, "I killed them."
Take care of the kid.
Certainly, sir.
Can I help you settle in, Master Grayson?
No.
Thanks, I won' t be staying long.
Is this a robin?
My brother' s wire broke once and I swung out and grabbed him.
My father said I was his hero.
I flew in like a robin.
Some hero I turned out to be.
But your father was right.
I can tell.
Throw this away, will you?
I think I' il just put it in here.
Broken wings mend in time.
One day Robin will fly again.
I promise.
We' il drive.
The Puzzler?
The Gamester?
Captain Kill?
Question Mark Man?
Thank you.
The Bat' s stubborn refusal to expire...... is driving us insane!
Don' t worry, baby.
You' il kill him soon.
Besides...... I made your favorite:
Sparkling champagne and...... yummy poached salmon with little quail eggs and...... a creamy...... dreamy...... lemon soufflé.
No, I made your favorite:
A charred heart of black boar...... a side of raw donkey meat...... and a Sterno and grain alcohol, straight up, baby!
Perfect!
Ladies, you spoil us!
We' re of two minds about what to eat first.
What?
I hope you made extra.
Who the hell are you?
Just a friend.
But you can call me...... The Riddler.
I' il call you dead, is more like it!
Talk!
But then if I talked, what would keep you from slaying me, O Segregated One?
That' s never going to heal if you don' t stop picking.
Let' s see if you bleed green.
It' s not me you want to kill.
That' s just too easy for someone as powerful as you and...... you.
But Batman...... there' s a challenge.
Kill the Bat!
Sounds like a good idea.
But have you thought it through?
A few bullets, a splash of blood, then what?
Wet hands.
Post- homicidal depression.
Why not humiliate him first?
Then, when he is at his weakest...... crush him!
I see that...... sparkle in your left eye.
I can help you get Batman.
That is, if you' Il...... spare my life for just a few moments.
Thank you.
I love what you' ve done with this place.
Heavy Metal meets House and Garden.
Beautiful.
It' s so dark and Gothic and...... disgustingly decadent.
Yet so bright and chipper and...... conservative.
It' s so you!
And yet, so you!
Very few people are both a summer and a winter, but...... but you pull it off nicely.
What' s the point?
Has anyone ever told you, you have a serious impulse- control problem?
This is the point.
This is how I found you.
Let me demonstrate.
This is your brain on The Box.
This is my brain on The Box.
Does anyone else feel like a fried egg?
I' il have more.
But only the first one' s free.
Here' s the bargain:
You' il help me steal production capital...... so I can put a Box on every TV in town...... and become Gotham' s cleverest, carbon- based life form!
And in return...
Is everybody paying attention?
I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all.
The mother of all riddles:
Who is...... Batman?
You violated the sanctity of our lair.
We should crush your bones into powder.
But you pose an interesting proposition.
Therefore, heads: we accept, and tails: we blow your damn head off.
Here' s a good one.
No, no, no!
There is a good one.
I' il attend to it.
- I' m not used to being waited on.
Don' t shoot me!
Give me that!
Two- Face, show me how to punch a guy!
Ball up your fist, reach back...... and assert yourself.
That looks fun.
Let me try.
Ball up the fist, reach way back... assert yourself.
One hundred thousand, two hundred and twenty.
One hundred and...
I lost count!
Last night another robbery, perpetrated by the Green- Suited Menace...... resulting in millions in diamonds stolen, with no sign of Batman.
Teamed with Two- Face, this new criminal' s pattern...... of marking his crimes with puzzles has Gothamites calling him The Riddler.
Apparently, you and Batman have a common enemy.
That was with the morning mail.
"The eight of us go forth, not back.
"To protect our king from the foe' s attack."
Chess pawns.
Clock.
Matches.
All physical, man- made objects.
Small in size, light in weight.
What' s the connection?
With all due respect, that' s why they call him The Riddler.
May I help you?
Why is this the only locked door?
What' s back there?
Master Wayne' s dead wives.
The silver closet.
On your way.
Now, you can be part of the action!
Nygma Tech brings the joy of 3- D entertainment into your home!
Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you...... my vision.
The Box in every home in America...... and one day, the world!
In local news, Edward Nygma' s 3- D Box...... has become the rage of Gotham.
Rioting occurred last night at electronic stores that were sold out.
There is hardly a home without the Nygma Tech Box.
Critics claim The Box turns Gothamites into zombies.
But Edward Nygma just shrugs.
"That' s what they said when TV was invented."
Master Dick!
Up here.
Just checking, young sir.
Intruder alert.
I have something for you.
It' s on the table.
I hope you like it.
Call it clinical intuition.
I thought your dreams needed changing.
My parents were murdered before me...... when I was a kid.
I don' t...... remember a lot of what happened, but...... what I do comes to me in my dreams.
Flashes.
There' s a new element now, though, I haven' t seen before.
It' s a red leather book.
Something else...
My dreams come to me when I' m awake now.
Bruce, you' re describing repressed memories.
Images of a forgotten pain that' s trying to surface.
I' il be right back.
Is it possible there' s an aspect of your parents' death you haven' t faced?
You were so young when it happened.
Maybe I should leave you two alone.
This goes way beyond taking your work home, doesn' t it?
All right.
I think he' s fascinating.
Clinically.
Why does a man do this?
It' s as if he' s cursed to pay a penance.
What crime could he have committed to deserve a life of nightly torture?
It' s more than just...... professional interest, isn' t it, Chase?
Bruce, are you jealous?
No.
I can' t be jealous of Batman.
I want to be close, but you won' t let me near.
What are you protecting me from?
Do you want to know me?
Do you want to know who I am?
I guess...... we' re all two people.
The one in daylight, and the one we keep in shadow.
Rage...... violence...... passion.
Excuse me.
I' m busy.
I have some distressing news about Dick.
Is he okay?
I' m afraid Master Dick has gone traveling.
He ran away?
Actually, he took the car.
He boosted the Jag?
Not the Jaguar.
The other car.
The Bentley?
No, sir.
The other car.
Come for a little ride in my love machine, babies?
It' s Batman!
Open up, Batman.
Wait!
That' s not Batman!
What do you mean?
That' s Batboy!
It ain' t the Bat!
Let her go!
Who the hell are you?
I' m Batman.
I forgot my suit, all right?
Come on, run!
Doesn' t Batman ever kiss the girl?
Go!
Thanks, you saved my life!
I could definitely get into this superhero gig.
Batman!
Bastard!
It should' ve been you!
If you had told Two- Face who you were at the circus...... they' d still be alive!
If Bruce Wayne could' ve given his life for your family, he would have.
All I can think about every day is getting Two- Face.
He took my whole life.
When I was out there tonight...... I imagined it was him I was fighting...... even when I was fighting you...... and the pain went away.
Do you understand?
Yes, I do.
Good.
You must help me find him.
When we do...... I' m the one who kills him.
So, you' re willing to take a life?
As long as it' s Two- Face.
Then it will happen this way:
You make the kill.
But your pain doesn' t die with Harvey, it grows.
So you run into the night to find another face, and another...... and another...... until one terrible morning you wake up and realize...... that revenge has become your whole life...... and you won' t know why.
You can' t understand.
Your family wasn' t killed by a maniac.
Yes, they were.
We' re the same.
If we' re the same, help me.
Train me, let me be your partner.
No.
I can' t.
You still have a choice.
Look, Bruce...... I' m a part of this, whether you like it or not.
Tonight all of Gotham society has turned out for Edward Nygma' s...... gala unveiling of his New Improved Box.
Thanks, Al.
My pleasure, sir.
They' il be dining and dancing the night away...... on the glamorous roof of the Ritz Gotham.
What' s it like to have your face on the cover of every magazine?
Edward, how does it feel to be the city' s newest, most- eligible bachelor?
Gotham must know!
There' s Bruce Wayne!
Oh, Eddie, he is too cute!
How come you don' t look so good in that suit?
Shut up.
You' re here to work!
How' s my mole?
Fine.
What about rumors of a Nygma Tech takeover of Wayne Enterprises?
Nygma Tech stock is outselling Wayne Enterprises two to one.
Are you yesterday' s news, Bruce?
Bruce, old man.
The press wonders what it' s like to be outsold, outclassed, out- coifed and...... generally outdone in every way.
Hello, Edward.
Congratulations.
Great party.
Nice suit.
Wit.
Good.
And you are?
Chase.
And what a grand pursuit you must be.
I' m Bruce Wayne, Miss...?
You can call me anything you want.
Ladies and gentlemen...... the future!
My New Improved Box offers fully- interactive holographic fantasies.
Edward, you' re dashing and a genius.
How do you create these images, hon?
That, my dear, is my little secret.
Fully- interactive holographs.
Only a high- frequency carrier wave, beamed into the brain...... could create such images.
And you wish you thought of it.
Don' t be a sore loser.
Give it a try.
If you can introduce images into the mind, what stops you from...... extracting images out of the mind?
Too timid to try my machine?
Just say so.
Shall we dance?
Naughty, naughty.
Looking for something?
I was just wondering how you turn it off.
Clever.
Thanks.
My pleasure.
Good evening, Mr. Wayne.
Relax.
Tell me your...... dreams.
Tell me...... your fantasies.
Tell me your secrets.
Tell me...... your deepest...... darkest...... fears.
Relax, folks!
It' s only an old- fashioned, low- tech stickup!
We' re interested in the basics:
Cash, jewelry, cellular telephones.
Hand them over nice and quietly, and no one will be hurt!
Emergency, Alfred.
Yes, sir.
Be calm, everybody!
Just stay calm!
Excuse me!
You' re ruining my big party!
Are you insane?
We' re sick of waiting for you to deliver Batman.
Patience, O Bifurcated One.
Patience, hell!
We want him dead!
And nothing brings out the Batman like a little murder and mayhem!
You could have let me in on the caper.
We could have organized it, planned it, pre- sold the movie rights!
Your entrance was good, his was better.
The difference?
Showmanship!
Emergency, Alfred.
Oh, sir...
I could be fired for this.
Perhaps they' il have me back at Buckingham Palace.
All right, boys!
Phase Two!
My place, midnight.
Nothing like a bad case of gas!
Why can' t you just die?
Hi.
What were you doing?
You got a real gratitude problem, you know that?
I need a name.
Batboy?
Knight Wing?
What' s a good sidekick name?
"Dick Grayson, college student."
Screw you!
I saved your life.
You owe me.
You' re going to get yourself killed.
I' m your new partner.
No!
Whenever you go out at night, I' il be watching.
Where Batman goes, I' il go.
How will you stop me?
I can stop you.
Hang this next to the Batsuit...... where it belongs.
You' re encouraging him.
Young men with a mind for revenge need little encouragement.
They need guidance.
You, above all, should know the consequences of the life you choose.
Even Chase calls being Batman a curse.
Perhaps the lady is just what the doctor ordered.
She seems lovely and wise.
I' ve never been in love before.
Go to her.
Tell her how you feel.
She wants Batman, not Bruce Wayne.
Let her decide.
I' m sorry.
I can' t believe this.
I' ve imagined this moment since I first saw you.
Your eyes...... your lips...... your body.
Now I have you and...... I' m wishing you were somebody else.
I guess a girl has to grow up sometime.
I' ve met someone.
He' s not you.
I hope you can understand.
I understand.
Well...
That' s just what I said.
Then I taught my doggie a new trick:
How to map the human mind.
Would you like to see what Bruce Wayne has in his head?
Riddle me this:
What kind of man...... has bats on the brain?
You can say it.
- You' re a genius.
Oh, stop.
So, from this day on...... Batman is no more.
You can' t just quit.
There' s monsters out there.
Batman has to protect the innocent.
I' ve dedicated my life to helping strangers I' ve never met.
Faces I' ve never seen.
Well...... the innocent aren' t faceless anymore.
You can' t tell me what to do with the rest of my life.
My dad told me that every man goes his own way.
My way goes to Two- Face.
You must help me.
And if you do find Harvey...... and then you kill him...... what next?
Exactly.
Then you' d be alone, like me.
No, you must let this go.
Listen to me, I' m your friend.
I don' t need a friend, I need a partner.
Two- Face has got to pay.
Please.
Chase is coming for dinner.
I' m going to tell her...... everything.
We' il talk.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Happy Halloween.
Happy Halloween to you.
I asked you here tonight because there' s something I wanted to tell you.
I wanted to tell you something too.
What I wanted...
Go ahead, you first.
Trick or treat!
All my life I have been...... attracted to a certain kind of man.
The wrong kind.
Look at what I do for a living.
And since...... since I met you, I...
Why am I so nervous?
Don' t eat too much tonight or you' il be sick in your beds.
Happy Halloween!
What' s wrong?
It' s happening again.
Flashes.
My parents' death.
Your memories are trying to break through.
I want to tell you something.
Something I' ve never told anyone.
It' s all right.
It' s all right.
I' m here.
The night of my parents' wake...... the priest' s words gave no comfort.
Of course.
There, on my father' s desk...... the red book.
His journal.
He' d written in it every day.
But now he' d never write in it again.
At that moment I knew...... my life would never be the same.
I raced out into the storm...... trying to outrun the rage.
The pain.
Then I fell.
I fell forever.
The cave was monstrous.
It must have been there for centuries.
I saw...
It was coming toward me.
I was scared at first, but only at first.
The figure in the dark was my destiny.
It would change my life forever.
I would use its image to strike terror into the hearts of those who did evil.
I would ensure what happened to me would never happen to anyone else.
I would have my revenge.
What are you trying to tell me?
I' m...
Twick or tweet!
Trick.
Remember the plan?
Seize and capture.
No killing.
That goes double for you.
If I was a superhero...... where would I hide?
Spank me.
Intruder alert!
Intruder alert!
Shut up!
Now, that' s impressive!
It' s always risky introducing a tamed animal into the wild.
They may have trouble adapting to their new environment.
Somebody tell the fat lady...... she' s on in five.
"Joygasm!"
Get the girl!
Don' t kill him.
If you kill him...
... he won' t learn nothing.
Master Bruce!
How are you, young man?
You haven' t called me that for a long time.
Old habits die hard.
Are you all right?
Where' s Chase?
I' m afraid they' ve taken her.
Master Dick has run away.
The cave has been destroyed.
And there' s another riddle.
I' m coming, my sweet.
Like the jacket?
It keeps me safe when I' m...... jogging at night.
Batman will come for me.
Batman?
Batman, you say?
Coming for you?
I' m...... counting on it.
What is that?
Where' s it coming from?
There!
Who' s doing that?
The Riddler!
"We' re five little items of an everyday sort.
"You' il find us all in a tennis court."
In...
A- E- l- O- U.
Vowels.
Not entirely unclever, sir.
But what do a clock, a match, chess pawns...... and vowels have in common?
What do these riddles mean?
Every riddle contains a number and they arrived in this order:
13, 1, 8...... and 5.
13, 1, 8 and 5.
Meaning?
Letters of the alphabet?
Of course, 13 is M.
1 would be A, 8 would be H and 5 would be E.
M- A- H- E.
Perhaps 1 and 8 are 18.
18 is R.
M- R- E.
How about...... "Mr. E"?
- Mystery?
- Another name for mystery?
Enigma.
Mr. E. Nygma.
Edward Nygma.
Stickley' s suicide was obviously a computer- generated forgery.
You really are quite bright, despite what people say.
Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications.
Tonight' s a good night.
What do you suggest?
By sea...... or by air?
Why not both?
Who' s your tailor?
I took the liberty, sir.
"R?"
What' s that stand for?
Robin.
Riddler and Two- Face can make a pretty lethal combination.
You could use a hand.
Two against two are better odds.
I can' t promise I won' t kill Harvey.
"A man' s got to go his own way."
A friend taught me that.
Not just a friend.
A partner.
He' s not coming.
Shut it down.
Wait a minute!
Hey, go!
A- 14.
Hit!
Sweet!
B- 12.
Hit!
My favorite vitamin.
That sinking feeling.
I like this game.
C- 9.
You sunk my battleship!
Who, me?
This is your captain speaking.
Please return to your seats.
We will be experiencing turbulence.
I got him!
I hope they can find the little black box.
Now...... the real game begins.
Holy rusted metal, Batman!
The ground, it' s all metal.
It' s full of holes: holey.
Wait!
The whole island' s moving!
Looking for us?
That was for my mother!
My father!
My brother!
And this is for me!
Finally, justice is served!
Let us die!
You' re a man after our own heart, son!
I' il see you in hell!
I' d rather see you in jail!
Good boy.
The Bat' s taught you well.
Noble.
Stupid...... but noble.
Riddle me that.
Who' s afraid of the big black bat?
No more tricks, Edward.
Very well, then.
Let' s get real.
Release Chase.
This is between you and me.
And me...... and me!
You' ve sucked Gotham' s brain waves and now you' ve devised a way to read minds.
You betcha!
Soon my little Box will be on countless TV' s around the world...... feeding me credit- card numbers...... bank codes...... sexual fantasies...... and little white lies.
Into my head they' il go.
Victory is inevitable.
For if knowledge is power...... then a god...... am...... I!
Was that over the top?
I can never tell.
By the way, I' ve seen your mind.
Freak!
Yours is the greatest riddle of all!
Can Bruce Wayne and Batman ever truly coexist?
We' il find out today!
But first, let' s meet our contestants.
Behind curtain...... number one...
... the absolutely fabulous Dr. Chase Meridian!
She enjoys hiking, manicures...... and foolishly hopes to be the love of Bruce' s life.
Behind curtain number two...
... "Fatman' s" one and only partner.
This acrobat turned orphan...... likes Saturday- morning cartoons and dreams of one day being...... bare- naked with a girl.
And below these contestants...... my personal favorite:
Just one little touch...... and five seconds later these two players are...... gull feed on the rocks below.
Not enough time to save them both.
Which one will it be, Batman?
Bruce' s love?
Or the Dark Knight' s junior partner?
There is no way for me to save them or myself.
It' s all one giant death- trap.
Judges?
I' m sorry.
Your answer must be in the form of a question.
But thank you for playing.
Wait!
I have a riddle for you.
For me?
Really?
Tell me.
I see without seeing.
To me, darkness is as clear as daylight.
What am I?
Please!
You' re as blind as a bat!
Exactly.
Bummer!
Thanks.
All those heroics for nothing.
No more riddles, no more curtains one and two.
Just plain curtains!
Aren' t you forgetting something?
Your coin.
You' re always of two minds.
You' re right.
Emotion' s always the enemy of true justice.
You' ve always been a good friend.
Why?
Why can' t I...... kill you?
Too many questions.
Poor Edward.
I had to save them both.
You see, I' m both Bruce Wayne and Batman.
Not because I have to be.
Now...... because I choose to be.
Thank you for responding to my request for a consultation, Dr. Meridian.
Edward Nygma...... has been screaming for hours that he knows the true identity...... of Batman.
Edward?
Who...... is it?
It' s Dr. Meridian.
Chase.
Do you remember me?
How could I forget?
Dr. Burton tells me...... you know who Batman is.
I can' t tell you if you don' t say, "please."
Edward, please.
Who is Batman?
I' m...... Batman.
Your secret is safe.
He is definitely a wacko.
"Wacko?"
Is that a technical term?
Listen...
... I won' t need this anymore.
Thank you for giving me a new dream.
Don' t work too late.

G. S. W... that' s what the hospitals call it -- gunshot wound.
The doctor has to report it to the police.
That makes it hard for guys in my line... to get what I' d call "quality health care."

Porter:
Not many men know what their life' s worth.
I do... 70 grand.
That' s what they took from me... and that' s what I was gonna get back.

Um, why?

Twice a week, Tuesday and Friday.
Always between 11: 00 and 12: 00... always the same route.
Hmm.
How much money in the case?
Anywhere between 350 and half a mil.
And how much do you need, Val?
Ah, we split it 50- 50.
No, I mean how much do you need to buy your way back?
lnto the syndicate.
How much?
You mean the outfit?
Jesus, you know everything.
Hi, sweetie.
130 grand.
The beauty of the Chows is they won' t go to the cops.
You notice anything about those guys, Val?
Probably all kung fu motherfuckers.
Did I miss something?
They weren' t wearing their seat belts.

140 apiece.
Total?
That' s what?
That' s 70 grand?
That' s not enough.
It is for me.
I' m taking the next few months off.
Here' s the bag, baby.
Yeah, well, I' m up short.
60 short.
Fucking slants!
Should' ve hit 'em Tuesday.
Fuck!
We got away clean... and got something to show for it.
Always be grateful for what you get.
Rule number one, Val.
Yeah.
What?
Everything' s cool.
It never is, Val.
Hey, baby, just put the money... in the car, will you?
I can' t fucking believe it.
You know what?
You know what, Porter?
This' il kill you.
[Gun Cocks]
You --
Shit!
Jesus, Lynn, wait till I' m out of the fucking way!
Oh!
You were great.
You were great.
Gimme the gun -- OK.
OK, keep the gun.
That' s it.
Everything' s cool.
Just like we planned.
Come on.
Ohh.
[Gasping]
[Gasping]
Lynn did not understand.
I don' t know, pally.
[Gasps]
What?
I didn' t get that.
[Knock On Door]
Come on, Ms. Porter, I don' t have all day!
[Sniffs]
ls, uh... is Ms. Porter here?
Yeah, whatever.
Aah!
[Coughing]
Get up, turn around.
Come on.
What have we got here, huh?
How much in here, huh?
2 grand.
What' s in here?
Helium.
What the fuck you think it is?
Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Val Resnick.
Where is he?
He' s right here.
Look.
Fuck you.
Wrong answer.
Shit!
You motherfucker!
Fuck!
Val Resnick.
I never heard of him, man.
Where' d you get the envelope and the shit?
Aw, come on, man, they' re gonna fucking kill me.
They' re gonna kill me, man.
[Cocks Gun]
What do you think I' m gonna do?
Oh, come on.
OK, OK, OK.
Stegman, man.
OK?
Where is he?
S- South End Taxi.
F- F- Farragut Road, man.
Thanks.
You' re welcome.
I' m looking for Arthur Stegman.
He ain' t here.
Something I can help you with?
No, you can' t.
Where is he?
I don' t know.
He ain' t here.
Take a guess.
What?
Take a guess about where he is.
[Scoffs]
[Sighs]
ls he at home?
Why don' t you go fuck yourself?
All right, here we go.
Hey, come on, roll it!
Not yours, man.
There' s somebody here to see you.
I' m looking for Stegman.
Who the hell are you?
I' m Porter.
Well, Porter... that looks like assault to me.
- Hey!
- Whoa!
Fuck, no!
Not in here.
Jesus, guys, he wants to talk.
Am I right?
Did I call it?
Are you Stegman?
Maybe.
What do you want?
Whoa, Artie.
Listen, don' t worry about it.
Why don' t we talk outside?
Artie, you' re a dealer?
Just forget about it, all right?
And don' t touch my money, either.
Come on.
Let' s --
This is heroin?
Guys, just -- Don' t worry about it, all right?
Just take it easy.
Let' s talk.
What are you guys looking at?
Play your game.
And you' re bleeding all over my couch.
Come on.
Steggie' s been holding out on us.
Check it out.
Val Resnick.
What about him?
No.
Even if I knew... the answer would still be no.
Where' d you meet up with my delivery boy?
ls he dead?
No, but she is.
O. D. ed on that crap you been sending her.
So?
What do you care?
I' m her husband.
You' re not gonna fucking kill me, are you?
Not in front of these kids.
Where is he?
I don' t know.
That' s the truth.
You see, this stuff gets delivered to me, too.
And I won' t see anyone again till next month.
Why all the trouble?
Well, he' s afraid of the girl.
You know, I mean, of -- of Mrs. Porter.
I mean, that' s how it looks to me.
Look, I don' t know nothing about this, OK?
I know Val from the old days.
3 months ago he shows up, asks me to do him a favor.
I make an extra grand a month... so I figure, what the hell, right?
Now you come around threatening to kill me?
Believe me, that much a buddy of Val' s...
He' s in the city.
How do you know that?
He said so.
- When?
- When he -- Then.
When he came around.
Said he squared himself with the syndicate... said he was back in the big time.
He was very excited.
Well, you tell him that Porter is back, too... and Porter wants his money.
Or I' il pay you a visit when these kids are not around.
Well --
When would I tell him this?!
[Ring]
Talk to me.
There' s a young lady to see you, sir.
Her name is Pearl.
She' s got 2 very bad habits.
Right now I' m only interested in one of them.
Apartment 718, ma' am.
[Telephone Rings]
Send her up.
What' s the problem?
Hey, Val, it' s Haskell.
Sorry to call you at home.
Don' t be sorry, sweetie.
Just don' t call.
What is it?
- [Knocks]
- It' s Stegman.
Shit.
Unh!
On your knees, bitch.
I want satisfaction.
I' m on the phone, Pearl.
That' s Mistress Pearl, you piece of dogshit.
I' m on the fucking phone!
Make it quick, huh?
Anyhow, this guy Stegman called.
Sounded like something scared the shit out of him.
He said he had to talk to you.
Yeah?
Did he tell you what it was about?
He said to tell you Lynn was dead.
Said some guy came around talking mean... and wanted you.
That' s all he said.
Thought you oughta know.
Yeah, you did right.
I want to talk to that son of a bitch.
Who, Stegman?
No, President Nixon.
Of course Stegman.
Tell him Varrick' s by the bridge.
Make it... Hmm... make it 20 minutes, huh?
Can' t you see I' m working here?
Can' t you see I' m working here?
Put it on my tab.
I' m looking for a girl.
She goes by the name of Rosie.
Here' s a picture of her.
You know her?
Wouldn' t be freelance.
Probably connected with the syndicate.
Outta my league.
I wouldn' t know her.
Well... maybe you know somebody who would.
Why you looking for her?
I' m her brother.
I got cancer.
You know how it is.
Yeah, you two look close.
Got a cigarette?
Your sister sounds expensive.
Try Michael, bartender at the Regal Hotel.
That wasn' t the name I was looking for.
It' s the only one I got.
I got nothing.
I never gave you my original number.
What did this guy look like?
Well, he had, like, dark hair, blue eyes.
He was a real Cro- Magnon- looking bastard.
lf Lynn' s dead... maybe he did us a favor, huh?
I know what you mean... except I' m out like a grand a month.
Maybe we can work something out.
Mmm.
He said his name was Porter.
He said he was there for Porter?
He said he was Porter.
I' il tell you something.
I wouldn' t want that guy after me, either.
I know how you must feel.
What am I, a nobody?
I' ve got friends.
All I have to do is point.
I pick up a phone, say his name... and he' s a dead man.
And this time he stays dead!
Val, try to keep it down.
It' s OK.
What did he say about me?
Not why?
Nothing else?
Nothing.
Why?
How much you owe him?
None of your goddamn business.
I just got the feeling he' d like to kill you... that' s all.
Oh, Christ.
Porter.
What did you tell him?
Nothin '.
What could I tell him?
The heroin?
He had it with him.
I told him I delivered it.
You didn' t tell him nothin 'else?
I don' t know nothin 'else.
You gave him something.
Someone who knows where to find me.
I swear, Val, on my mother --
Hey, fuck your mother!
Hey, that' s not nice.
What the fuck you looking at?
Not again.
Huh?
What the fuck you looking at?
No, Val, not again.
What the fuck are you looking at?
Val, come on, don' t.
Not again.
Manager: ls there some trouble here?
No.
We' re just -- We' re leaving.
You know what, Val?
This one' s on me, OK?
No.
Sorry.
He just got a promotion... so he' s a little tense.
Hey, pal, is there a Michael here?
That' s him over yonder.
I' m told you' re the man to see... about expensive horizontal refreshment.
I' m looking for a girl named Rosie.
Prostitution is illegal... and you' re speaking Greek.
Aah!
Be discreet now.
[Coughs]
Rosie.
Just call her.
- Rosie?
- Yeah.
Give me the phone.
Take care of that.
Who the hell is this?
Porter.
Try again, honey.
Porter' s dead.
I used to drive for you... provide a safe work environment.
Yeah.
Porter:
Why pour salt on old wounds?
I didn' t need to.
Hi.
Come in.
You look pretty good for a dead guy.
How' d you hear about it?
People who know were talking.
Plus, I heard your wife was back in town alone.
She' s dead.
I' m sorry, Porter.
Why?
Jesus.
Surly Porter.
You' re the same as ever, aren' t you?
Yeah, well, people change.
[Growling]
It' s OK, baby.
It' s OK.
Come on, sweetheart.
It' s OK.
Meet the nastiest damn dog who ever lived.
What' s his name?
Porter.
He took your job after you left.
He' s just as tough... but he won' t leave me, will you, baby?
I need a favor.
A favor?
Maybe you' re not the same as ever.
I' m looking for a syndicate boy.
It' s the "outfit," baby.
We don' t say "syndicate" anymore.
You know what I mean.
Don' t get touchy, Porter.
What' s his name?
Val Resnick.
Oh, that son of a bitch.
You know him?
Yeah.
I met up with him once a few years ago.
He can' t use Star Service anymore... because he beats up all the girls... and he almost killed one.
You?
Does it matter?
You quit looking after me, remember?
Would you happen to have a line... on where he might be?
I suppose he' s at the hotel.
Which one?
The outfit hotel.
They' re all there.
You got an address?
We' re friends, right?
I mean, we used to be.
But I' m an employee, too, and I don' t think the outfit... would like me telling you where the hotel was, would they?
What do you think I' m gonna do?
How strong are you, Porter?
I have ever met.
But I wonder if it' s enough.
For what?
lf I know you... you want this Resnick guy for something he won' t like.
Yeah, I' m gonna kill him.
That' s something he won' t like.
What if something goes wrong, and they grab you... and they ask you where you found out about the hotel?
Why are we even talking about this?
You know I wouldn' t turn you in.
But what if they ask you hard?
I' il -- I' il tell them it was a cab dispatcher named Stegman.
The Oakwood Arms, Union and 17th.
Hi, Val.
Where' s my money?
No, it' s not there.
I took your gun.
You look like a pro.
You keep your mouth shut... and you' il walk out of here.
My 70 grand -- I want it.
I don' t have it right now.
Where is it?
I gave all 130, 000 to the outfit.
I gave it all to them.
Well... tell them you gave them money that doesn' t belong to you... and get it back.
Now, Porter, I can' t do that.
I mean, you don' t know these guy --
You' re gonna kill me whether I get the money or not.
I' il get the money.
Just give me a few days, all right?
What the fuck are you doing?
Noon.
Tomorrow.
Say it.
All right.
You know, this may sound crazy, Porter... but, uh, no hard feelings, huh?
I did what I had to do.
You could appreciate that.
Yeah, I appreciate that, you --
No, no, no.
Don' t.
Please.
[Kissing]
Jesus.
God.
You bitch!
Me love you, baby.
Me love you long... time.
[Laughing]
[Coughing]
Wait up, hon.
You and the money... be at the corner of 7th and Franklin... at the pay phone.
OK.
Where' d you get this?
Hmm?
Some hooker had it on her shelf.
I recognized you.
I swiped it in case I could use it.
Huh?
The hooker -- did you hurt her?
So go boil an egg.
Philip tells me you have a problem... you need help with.
Yes, sir.
Ahem.
Then he breaks into my apartment --
There' s an old expression... that has served me well.
"Do not shit where you eat."
Or "live."
"Do not shit where you live."
Yeah, I like that better.
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry, Mr. Carter.
There are 3 ways that we can handle this.
1 -- We can help you.
2 -- We can allow you to help yourself.
And 3 -- We can have you replaced.
We have an investment in you, Resnick... of time, money, and training... so assisting you would be, in a way... protecting our investment.
And that is always good business policy.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, Mr. Carter.
Thank you, sir.
You won' t regret it.
Yes.
And you say that he' s alone... and that he' s a professional robber... is that correct?
Yes, sir.
Mm- hmm.
What' s his name?
Porter.
[Stammers]
You know, I don' t know it.
He never called himself anything but Porter.
Where did you get the $130, 000?
That' s why this man has come to town, huh?
The $130, 000 that you paid us back?
Yes, sir, but only 70, 000 of it was his.
Well, we never asked you where you got the money.
It' s none of our business... but now it appears it has become our business.
[Philip Clears His Throat]
Here' s his file, Mr. Carter.
Do you understand your value... to the organization, Resnick?
You' re a sadist.
You lack compunction.
But now you' ve allowed an area... of your personal life to become a danger to us.
A man in our organization needs to be tough... and self- reliant.
Were you to handle this problem on your own... there would be no doubt... that you' re the kind of man we want.
I want to.
Ahem.
I want to handle it myself, Mr. Carter.
Great.
I want you to move out of the Oakwood Arms.
Uh, ahem, but I don' t have a place, uh --
I don' t want anymore unpleasantness at the hotel.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me for saying so, Mr. Carter... but it might be easier if Resnick just disappeared.
I thought about that... but I' m not worried about Resnick.
He wouldn' t last 2 minutes out on the street without us.
It' s that other mutt I' m thinking about.
What' s his name?
Porter.
Takes a lot of moxie to walk right into the outfit... and start whacking our guys around.
Either that, or he' s shit nuts.
Frankly, I don' t understand it for $130, 000.
His share.
That' s even worse.
I don' t want Mr. Bronson hearing about this.
He' il think I' m getting soft.
One of his principles has always been...
"lf you don' t understand it, get rid of it."
A stitch in time, so to speak, so... stitch this mutt up, Phil.
Any Polaroids or trophies?
No, not this time.
- [Loud Whimpering]
- Yeah?
They cut me loose, Pearl.
Just like I thought they would.
Hold on one second.
Shut up!
I' m on the fucking phone!
[Whipping, Screaming]
Did your friends make it to town?
Last night, baby.
Now, did you tell them... it was Porter took their payroll?
I did.
And they want retribution.
All right, here' s what we do.
Pearl:
Yeah, that' s Porter.
He' s shit for brains.
Oh, shit.
Shit!
Next time, Porter.
Looks like Porter' s made some new friends.
Easy, mister.
I don' t want to press charges.
Who were they, huh, pal?
I don' t know.
Oh, it' s you guys.
Our buddy Stegman says you got a line... on a load of cash there, Porter.
250 grand, to be exact.
70.
Come on, man.
All right, all right, all right.
What do you take us for, huh?
Nobody' d go through all this shit for 70 grand.
You look like a whole bunch of trouble to us.
We got a witness, though.
A guy with only one nostril.
Remember him?
Hey, don' t worry, Porter.
We' re gonna give you immunity.
Room to operate, "Get Out of Jail Free" card.
All you got to do is get the money.
Oh, we can' t help you, though.
You understand, Porter?
It' s my money.
Wrong, Porter.
It' s our money, Porter.
Me and my partner' s money.
You be a good boy, we' il give you a piece.
We' il be easy, Porter.
You got it?
Yeah, he' s got it.
You understand?
You take it easy, huh?
We' il be in touch.
Sure, thanks.
Fuck.
Porter:
Did they come any other way?
lf I had been just a little dumber...
I could have joined the force myself.
Yeah.
It' s gonna sting.
Just clean it up, all right?
You hold it there.
Yeah, right.
I' il do it.
Tell me something, Porter.
When did you decide to leave?
Was it that night we slept together?
No.
It was the next day when I had to drive you to work.
You could have asked me to quit.
You could have asked me to drive you somewhere else.
Thanks.
Does it fit?
Oh, yeah...
like it was made for me.
It' il look great in your casket.
You know what I think?
I think that, uh... all those stories about you being dead were true.
You' re just too thick- headed to admit it.
Porter.
God, I missed you.
Don' t talk.
Don' t.
Oh, no, I...
I got, uh... stuff to do.
[Sighs]
Porter.
Where is he?
Where is he?
He' s in the bedroom.
No.
That' s bullshit.
Porter, here I come, pally.
Goddamn!
- Goddamn!
Whoa.
[Chuckles]
Ahh.
[Whimpers]
Where is he?
Yeah.
He used to drive me.
Yeah.
I' m driving you now, honey.
[Chuckles]
You know what you are?
'cause he' s too terrified of his own fucking shadow!
ls that right?
ls that right?
Then I guess you must be the lucky girl.
Ho.
I knew I' d seen that ass before.
Jesus.
Aah.
Hiya, Val.
This syndicate -- or outfit... or whatever the hell you call it -- it' s got a head man, right?
Who is it?
They' il kill me, Porter.
What do you think I' m gonna do to you?
Worry about me.
Aah!
Goddamn!
Fairfax and Carter.
Fairfax and Carter.
Where do I find them?
Fairfax isn' t in town right now.
What about Carter?
ls he in town?
Porter, it won' t do you any good.
They' re gonna -- Jesus!
You mo -- f...
Frederick Carter lnvestments.
120 Commerce Avenue.
Ahh.
Hey, thanks.
All right.
All right!
I' il help you out.
You' re fuckin 'nuts... going up against the outfit for 70 grand... but I' m gonna help you out.
Yeah?
Here.
Keep talking.
Thank -- Mmm.
How many guys in there?
But, uh, well... it' s tighter than hell.
[Chuckling]
You got a light?
You got a light?
Uh... no.
No.
Wait!
Check my pocket!
[Muffled Gunshot]
Rosie.
ls your name on the lease here?
The outfit.
The outfit pays for everything.
I want you to gather everything up you need... say good- bye to this place.
[Dog Whimpers]
It' s OK, baby.
It' s OK, puppy.
How are you?
I know, I know.
It' s not much... but at least you' il be safe.
Nobody knows I' m here.
What?
What?
[Ring]
[Ring]
[Ring]
He' s taking long enough.
Maybe the dog, too.
You think so?
[Line Ringing]
Give it a minute.
Shit.
- Aah!
Porter:
It' s not just anybody that gets a hit put on them... by a big firm like the outfit.
I was moving up in the world.
Maybe it was time to pay them a visit.
Carter wouldn' t be expecting that.
And who knows...
Hicks:
Told you he' d show up.
Give me my goddamn money, please.
Give me my money, too.
Sure that' s him?
Yeah.
Thank you very much.
Hey, fellas.
What you up to, buddy?
Well, our money' s in there... if you' re still interested.
Huh.
What' s he doing here?
It' s a ride- along, Porter.
See, your piece of the pie just got a little smaller.
But don' t worry, I' il leave you some crust.
What are you waiting for, Porter?
Go get it.
Go get our money.
You guys do me a favor?
We' re here to help, buddy.
They' re probably gonna frisk me when I go in there... so I wonder if you wouldn' t mind holding on to this.
Jesus.
You know, just for a little while.
Hey.
Nice balance.
Douche bag.
[Chuckles]
Can I help you?
I wanna see Mr. Carter.
And who are you?
Tell him I' m the guy that whacked Val Resnick.
I' m sorry, I don' t --
[Garbled Radio Noise]
Didn' t copy.
Repeat.
Right.
Mr. Carter will see you.
Uh, turn around so I can frisk you.
Bravo.
Sit down.
My compliments.
They were 2 of my best.
Didn' t know how they' d lull too easy.
There' s something you want from me.
Val Resnick gave you $130, 000.
It was a debt. $70, 000 is mine.
I want it back.
Resnick told me... but I seem to have misplaced your name.
Porter.
Porter.
Right.
I won' t forget it again.
The outfit is not unreasonable, Porter... but no corporation in the world... would agree to what you' re asking.
What about Fairfax?
Will he give me my money?
Resnick told you quite a bit, didn' t he?
Fairfax will tell you the same thing I have.
We' re not authorized to do things like this.
Who is?
Who makes the decisions?
No.
One man.
You go high enough, you come to one man.
Who?
Yes.
Mr. Bronson...
I have Mr. Carter on the line.
Put him through.
Go ahead, sir.
Hey, Carter, how' s business?
You wanted to see me, Dad?
Pretty good up till now.
Hang on, Carter.
Look in that green box, Johnny.
Are you kidding me?
Ha- ha! ls it the convertible?
You thought I forgot, didn' t you?
Have a happy birthday, son.
Johnny:
This car... and Nick' s got us ringside... at the championship fight tonight.
Gonna be a good one, too.
My money' s on Rankin.
No, I don' t think so.
That' s got nothing to do with it, son.
Well, I gotta get going.
Thanks.
Happy birthday.
Drive safe!
You got it, Dad!
Sorry, Carter.
What is it?
I have a problem.
70, 000.
It' s 70 --
How much is this guy Carter worth to you?
What do you mean?
Either I get my money, or I' il kill Carter.
Are you threatening me?
Bronson:
An audacious man.
Who are you?
Uh, heh... my money -- yes or no?
No.
Carter?
[Phone Bell Jingles]
Bronson:
Carter, talk to me.
Call Fairfax and tell him I just croaked Carter.
And he' s next.
And after that, I' m coming to get you.
Are you out of your fuckin 'mind?
You just dug your own grave.
I don' t see any cash.
They write you a check?
They gave me the run- around.
I have to go and see another guy.
Last one, then we got a dead woman, an assault... and all kinds of stuff to talk to you about.
That means more paperwork, Porter... and we don' t like paperwork.
Damn shame, Porter.
Don' t let the bastards get you down.
Don' t give up.
Hey, can I have my piece back?
Oh, yeah.
Nice roscoe, Porter.
Heavy enough to be a nutcracker.
We' il be in touch, Rocky.
Nobody likes a monkey on their back.
I had 3... and they were cramping my style.
I was gonna have to lighten the load.
[Door Slams]
Where have you been?
You know, evening up the odds a little.
These guys aren' t gonna stop until they kill us... are they?
No.
I' m sorry.
Sorry I got you involved in this.
So why did you?
You' re a clever guy.
You didn' t need me.
So why did you?
Yeah, you' re right.
I came back here with nothing.
No hope.
You were the only good thing in my life... that hadn' t been taken from me.
I couldn' t stay away.
I had to see you... just to make sure I wasn' t in hell.
So why don' t we get out of here?
We can' t.
Why?
They' re not gonna stop until they bury us.
So...
So we bury them first.
I should' ve quit.
I should' ve driven you somewhere else.
[Cheering]
[Fight Bell Clangs]
Hey, look.
Hey, look.
Whoa.
That' s me!
Happy birthday, Johnny.
What' s next?
You' re the man.
You' re totally the man.
This is your night.
Hey, Johnny.
Who is that?
Yes!
We didn' t do it.
We had nothing to do with this.
Go!
Boy, you are cute, aren' t you?
You must have some pretty wonderful friends, Johnny.
Wealthy, too, 'cause I' m not cheap.
Don' t wait up, boys.
[Laughing]
See you, man!
Damn!
[Giggling]
Mmm.
Yeah, right there.
Who' s the professional here, Johnny?
So go with it.
I promise you won' t regret it.
Hello.
Get hurt?
What' s he talking about?
Shh.
[Blues Playing On Radio]
Good to have you back in town...
Mr. Fairfax.
I wish I could say I was glad to be back.
I was swimming with the dolphins this morning.
Easy, would you?
It' s genuine alligator, for God' s sake!
What' s the matter with you?
Sorry, Mr. Fairfax.
Hello, Mr. Fairfax.
How' s it going, Charlie?
Porter and Fairfax.
Well, between us and our neighborhood cops...
I' d say we got him pretty well covered, huh?
Walter!
Wake up!
Keep those bags up, boys.
Come on.
Who the hell are you?
I' m the reason you' re home early...
You' re Porter?
That' s it.
Keep them up, boys, at shoulder level.
Drop them, and I' il drill you.
[Grunting]
Well, what' il you have me do... stand on my head?
I want you to do me a favor.
Call Mr. Bronson... see what we can do about getting my money back.
Well... he let Carter die.
But that poor buck- toothed bastard' s... probably better off dead anyway.
He' d probably let me die, too.
No, with Carter, he thought I was bluffing.
Try him.
You might find him more receptive than you think.
All right.
Hello.
Well, it' s like this...
I' m standing in my living room... and there' s a man here named Porter... who says that he expects you... to pay him sooner or later.
Yes, of course.
He wants to talk to you.
Put it on the speaker.
This is Porter.
You got balls, Porter.
You' re proving to be a real pain in the ass... a mosquito.
To get rid of you, I' il swat you with 130 grand.
It' s not 130 --
Hey, what the hell are you doing, man?
Fairfax?
Fairfax.
Oh, it' s all right.
That' s just mean.
That' s mean, man.
You people aren' t listening.
It' s not 130 gr --
No, you listen.
I' il get you your money... but you' re never gonna live to enjoy it.
You let me worry about that.
I want you to deliver the money yourself.
You' re one hell of an optimist.
What in the world makes you think...
Well, if you don' t... you' il never see little Johnny again.
Didn' t come home from the fight last night... did he?
He' s a good- looking kid... but you indulge him too much.
I told him so.
Bullshit.
You haven' t got him.
You wouldn' t be that stupid.
My dad never bought me a Ferrari.
I had to steal my first one.
Nice inscription on the key chain.
A little sappy.
Want me to read it?
You' re dead, Porter.
You hear me?
Bronson:
You' re a dead man.
That' s Johnny, Mr. Bronson... unless you turn up with the money.
ls that a yes?
Hmm?
What' s the matter, cat got your crotch?
Some decisions are hard, Mr. Bronson.
Where?
I' il let you know.
I' il be in touch.
You just signed your own death warrant... for $130, 000.
I don' t -- I don' t get that.
What is it?
I' m getting misty.
And tell him it' s 70, will you?
70?
What do you mean it' s only 70?
Only 70, 000?
Hell, my suits are worth more than that!
Aw, man.
"Ocean Ray Sundancer.
Camper canvas.
Vacuum flush head. "
80, 000 bucks.
[Breathes Deeply]
I' m telling you, you ain' t gonna have it.
You wanna bet?
No, I don' t wanna bet.
I' m out 150 already.
150 I' m getting my damn boat.
Better come down with something.
Hey, hey.
Hicks, Leary.
lnternal Affairs.
You boys wanna back off?
We' re on a stakeout here.
Wanna step out of the car, please?
What for?
I think you better step out of the car.
What the hell' s going on?
I don' t know.
ls this your badge, Detective?
The one you reported missing?
Yeah.
Where exactly did you lose it?
Does this belong to you?
It' s Porter.
Follow him.
Hey.
Get in, Porter.
Stegman:
Close the door.
Now set the roscoe on the floor.
[Clunk]
See, I' m gonna turn you in to the outfit for a reward.
And maybe they' il be so impressed... that they' il ask me to join... and I' il be on easy street.
Medical, dental.
I' m just -- I' m gonna walk you right in.
Unless you get rambunctious.
Then I' il just have to take care of you mysel --
You' re not gonna fuckin 'kill me, are you?
[Groaning]
Oh.
Ay, uh...
Hey!
Who are you?
What are you doing?
Hey, fatboy!
Yeah, I' m talking to you.
[Engine Starts]
[Tires Squealing]
Ohh.
I hate it.
Look at this stinking place.
Just tell us where he is... so we can get the hell out of here, huh?
Come on.
Too late now.
He doesn' t wanna say anything.
He just wants to get himself beat up... that' s all.
Here it is.
[Sighs]
That' s as close... as you' re ever gonna get to it... but I' il make you a deal.
Tell me where John is... and I' il finish you quick.
I promise you won' t have to find out... what your left ball tastes like.
I' il make this last 3 weeks.
Where is he?
[Coughs]
I' m waiting.
Shit!
I' m listening.
This little piggy stayed home.
It' s starting to look like roast beef.
8 to go.
Then it' s your knees, Porter.
You can guess where we go from there.
Where is he?
Hmm?
24...
24 Fielding.
Apartment 11.
You' il understand... if I don' t entirely trust you.
Put him in the trunk.
We' il take him along.
Let' s go, tough guy.
[Grunting]
Fairfax:
You two, watch the front.
[Grunting]
Aah!
Fuck.
Come on, Porter.
[Grr]
Hey, do me a favor.
Give me your lighter for a second.
[Breathing Rapidly]
[Jiggles Doorknob]
Come on.
[Telephone Ringing]
[Ring]
Bronson:
What the hell' s going on?
[Clicking]
Get out.
[Groaning]
[Engine Starts]
[Grunts]
[Honk Honk]
[Grunts]
Come on, Porter.
It' s been fun.
Hey!
You bitch!
Come on, Porter.
Let' s go.
What took you so long?
Oh, hi, Rosie.
Come on.
Come on, Porter.
Come on.
Get in there.
Good.
Oh, my God.
What happened to you?
I got hammered.
Are you OK?
You got it.
Piece of cake.
[Engine Starts]
Where to?
Just drive, baby.
Porter:
We were going for breakfast... in Canada.
We made a deal.
lf she' d stop hooking...
I' d stop shooting people.
Maybe we were aiming high.
[Big Band Music Begins Playing]
[New Big Band Song Begins]
I was orphaned at an early age
I had no name, so people called me Nameless
Being a nobody, I studied swordsmanship
After 10 years of practice, I acquired a unique skill
The King of Qin has summoned me
My deeds have astonished the Kingdom
By order of His Majesty we have brought the mighty warrior
His Majesty has known no peace
To the astonishment of all a mighty warrior of Qin has smashed them
His Majesty can finally sleep at night!
We rejoice for our King!
This warrior sent from Heaven has exterminated the assassins
Summon the warrior!
Remain 100 paces from His Majesty
Or you will be executed Never forget that
No one is allowed within 100 paces of me
Do you know why?
To guard against assassins
Yes.
That' s why I am confined in this armor
You have removed a great peril for me
How should I reward you?
My service was for Qin, not for a reward
Achievements must be rewarded
Sky' s silver spear... wounded many of my brave warriors
Announce my edict!
By order of His Majesty he who kills Sky will receive gold and land and be allowed to drink within 20 paces of His Majesty
I am informed you' re a citizen of Qin
I am a Prefect from Leng Meng County
A County Prefect of only 10 square miles!
Surely the lowest- ranking official in Qin
How did you defeat such opponents?
I took them on one by one
Tell me the details
Does Your Majesty know Flying Snow and Broken Sword were lovers?
Yes, I do
And that they hadn' t spoken for three years?
For three years?
Why?
Flying Snow had an affair with Sky
Broken Sword never forgave her
Why haven' t I heard this before?
I went to great lengths to uncover it
To divide Flying Snow and Broken Sword I first needed to eliminate Sky
I have an idea of what you planned
Your Majesty is wise
What did you use to defeat Sky?
The sword
I' m in charge of arresting criminals in my county
On the fifth day of the sixth month Sky attended a chess house
I had learnt he enjoyed playing chess and listening to music there
So, the seven masters of Qin Palace
We are here to arrest you!
Identify yourself by showing your spear
Halt!
What can a minor official do?
This is my territory
So?
You are on the King' s most wanted list.
I am placing you under arrest
Old man, please play one more tune
Martial arts and music are different but they share the same principle
Both stress attaining a supreme state
SKy and I faced each other for a long time
Neither of us moved We fought the battle in our minds
How swift thy sword!
I thought I knew everything about my Kingdom
I didn' t know that Leng Meng County held a talent like yours
Broken Sword
Flying Snow
By order of His Majesty!
Flying Snow and Broken Sword have teamed up for assassination
He who kills either of them will receive gold and land and be allowed to drink within 10 paces of His Majesty
Three years ago, Flying Snow stormed the palace with Broken Sword 3000 elite troops couldn' t stop them
I' ve since emptied the palace so assassins cannot hide
Was your sword swifter than theirs combined?
No
How did you do it, then?
Disguised as a citizen of Zhao I sought them in the Kingdom of Zhao
I learned they were hiding in a calligraphy school under the names Highcliff and Springbrook
Rumor had it the Qin army would attack that day
Most of the townspeople had fled Only the school' s students remained
Why have you come at this time?
Who are you?
I' m from Yi County in the Kingdom of Zhao
My father' s dying wish was for one of your scrolls
I fear this may be our school' s last day
Which calligrapher do you seek?
I respectfully request Master Highcliff
Highcliff was Broken Sword
Legend said his skill as a swordsman was rooted in his calligraphy
So I had my concerns I needed to find out if it was true
What do you want written?
"Sword"
You are fond of the sword?
It was my father' s dying wish
What size scroll?
Eight feet
For that size I will need red ink
My master asked me to borrow some red ink
My master wants to borrow some red ink
Did you hear me, Master Springbrook?
Master Highcliff wants to borrow red ink
Tell him to come himself
Could I have some red ink?
The character "sword" was still being written when Your Majesty' s troops arrived at the city gates
Your Majesty' s army is invincible not only because it is brave but also because of its archery with a greater range than any other army
Hail!
Please remember their arrows might destroy our town and topple our Kingdom but they can never obliterate our culture
Hail!
Those Zhao people didn' t flee?
They drew strength from their calligraphy
What was so difficult about "sword"?
There are 19 different ways to write it
I asked Broken Sword for a 20th way
Both calligraphy and swordplay rely on one' s strength and spirit
The 20th style would reveal the essence of his swordsmanship
How odd to write it in 19 ways
Impossible to comprehend
Once I' ve conquered the six Kingdoms and all the northern tribes
I will eradicate this problem by mandating one style of writing
Wouldn' t that be ideal?
Your Majesty won' t stop at the six Kingdoms?
The six Kingdoms are nothing!
Hail!
Master Springbrook
Why are you going outside?
To fend off the arrows
You aren' t needed.
The Qin archers are powerful
Hail!
You are good
You are even better
You didn' t come here for calligraphy
Who are you?
I' ve travelled here to deliver an item
Please meet me in the library at midnight
Great calligraphy
Great swordplay
You didn' t even see my swordplay
I couldn' t have written without it
At midnight meet me in the library
Several thousand Qin troops were readying for the next onslaught
I studied the character all night trying to unlock the secret of his skills
It would reveal his swordsmanship?
But it' s just an ordinary word
Calligraphy and swordplay are similar
One must comprehend their true essence
It eluded me
So how did you challenge them?
Sky died by your sword?
Yes
Who are you?
Why are you here?
I' m from the Kingdom of Qin I have a message from Sky
Go on
He said he lived a life without responsibilities or commitments
He cared for only one person
Who?
Flying Snow
Sky was certain she' d avenge his death
To fight, meet me at the Qin camp
You can leave now
Go!
I know you saw us!
I let you see us on purpose!
I no longer care about you at all!
We were both very foolish
I' m not going to fight you.
Go away!
I will kill you in honor of my master!
You ask to die.
I will help you
Why do you laugh?
What you did last night was stupid
When Flying Snow was fighting me she was disturbed and disoriented
I defeated her easily
like Broken Sword and Flying Snow allowing their emotions to be a liability
It sounds as if you did divide them
Yes
In that case, they must have been petty and narrow- minded
True
Your story sounds logical
But you have underestimated one person
Who?
Me
Would you like my impression of them?
Three years ago they stormed the palace
I was impressed by their valor and dignity
Their character could not be petty
So Flying Snow' s affair with Sky is a lie
Their betrayal of one another is a lie
The story you just told is a lie!
Except for one thing Sky did know one of you
Who?
You
I surmise you two were old friends
And Sky' s defeat has only one explanation
What' s that?
He permitted it
To kill me, the two of you formed a pact using my men as witnesses
That was not hard to arrange
The hardest part was to persuade Sky to put his life in your hands
You were not fast enough to defeat Sky
He died willingly under your sword
Such devotion deserves true respect
He was the first to sacrifice himself for your mission
Sky was proud
He saw himself as an unrivalled fighter
What convinced him you could succeed where he had failed?
You have trained, perhaps for 10 years with one goal, my assassination
You have a great skill that few can counter
Killing Sky got you within 20 paces of me
So why seek out Broken Sword and Flying Snow?
I presume that your skill requires you to come within 10 paces
You needed a second sacrifice to claim another reward to bring you within 10 paces
Although Broken Sword and Flying Snow had never met Sky they instantly understood the reason for his defeat
How far am I from the bookshelves?
About 10 paces 10 paces is fine
I need one of you to help me
Please decide between yourselves
Meet me at the Qin camp tomorrow morning
How swift thy sword!
True
Sky was a superior warrior
He willingly gave his life to this man
He can kill the King
We must proceed
That means... we will die
Then we die together
You were one step ahead of me
Did I hurt you too much?
I should be the one who fights him
I want you to live
If you died, how could I live?
You will live on, promise me
Say it!
All right
Moon is on her way
I had better go
I am Nameless, Prefect of Leng Meng County
She is on His Majesty' s most wanted list
Now she' s here, I will arrest her
The assassin and I have an agreement to fight one on one
Should I be unable to defeat her please apprehend her
Your permission is sought
Hail!
Hail!
I die willingly
Hail!
How swift thy sword!
I believe you and Broken Sword also fought
It was not real but rather it was a battle in your minds
A fight to honor Flying Snow
My master wishes you to have his sword
Why?
He and she are bound in life and death
They will never part, nor will their swords
It is his dying wish that you take his sword for your mission
Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword sacrificed themselves so you can be within 10 paces of me
All three gave you their lives
The best of friends could not give more
Therefore you are the most dangerous assassin of all
How did you uncover my plan?
The flames of these candles are disturbed by your murderous intent
I' m ashamed to say I' m not that committed
Your Majesty has seen through our plan
If I had realized this sooner
I wouldn' t have allowed you so close
A citizen of Qin would not do this
Who are you?
A man of Zhao
Your Qin soldiers killed my family
I wandered into Qin and was adopted
I discovered my real identity 10 years ago and set my heart on this plan
You' ve come to avenge Zhao
I see
If your special skill has a name
As Your Majesty guessed there is only one crucial move
What is that?
"Death within 10 Paces"
"Death within 10 Paces" A good name!
All my guards are 100 paces away outside the palace
You are within 10 paces
It would seem that today I am doomed
But I sense your hesitation
You Majesty is perceptive
However you too have underestimated someone
Who?
Broken Sword
I needed to prove to them that my sword was fast and accurate
Within 10 paces my sword strikes with surgical precision
If it enters at precise pressure points it will not cause any fatal injury
If one of you would take a blow before witnesses, we can fool the King
Such a blow is hardly child' s play
How is Sky now?
Fully recovered
His trust in your sword was amazing
The King' s security is impregnable
There was no other way
His Imperial Guards were useless before
He should have died three years ago
What went wrong?
I abandoned the plan
The King must not be killed
He said that?
Yes
Why?
I also asked him
What did he say?
He would not explain that day
Broken Sword is the strongest among of the three assassins
He and I are probably equal in skills
What he told me later greatly unsettled me
While I' m alive I' il stop you from assassinating the King
I will help you
He let the opportunity go by once
This time, we must succeed
I will see you tomorrow at the Qin camp
Please do me a favor
Help me fight Broken Sword!
Master!
What are you waiting for?
Although I had agreed to help attacking from behind is dishonorable so I couldn' t draw my sword
If we did not stop Broken Sword we would never succeed
Moon, don' t!
You' re no match for him.
Stop
I knew this would happen
You can' t stop me now
Even wounded, I would still stop you
Then I will kill you!
Did I hurt him too much?
Your special medicine should heal his wounds in a day
Have you delivered it?
I tended to the wound myself
After the battle, take my sword and follow Nameless to see the King
Yes
They won' t treat a servant harshly
If the assassination succeeds wave a red flag on your return
If it fails, a yellow one
If something happens to you my message will be useless
If I see a red flag
How is Flying Snow?
Recovering
She doesn' t know I' ve come
You said you' d stop me
Please abandon the mission
You know I' m a man of Zhao
So am I
Doesn' t Qin want to conquer Zhao?
Yes
Isn' t the King the enemy of Zhao?
Yes
Who are you trying to defend?
You call yourself a man of Zhao?
Flying Snow has asked me that too
When we first met
I was living a carefree life
Who died in battle with Qin
She inherited his sword
She wanted to avenge her father
I promised to help her
Calligraphy and swordplay share the same principles
We did calligraphy to inspire our swordplay and to heighten our powers
She knew I' d drifted since childhood calling no place home
Once we' d killed the King, she said She would take me to her home
There' d be no more swordsmen Only us
The essence of calligraphy is from the soul
Swordsmanship is the same
Both aspire to truth and simplicity
Gradually I recognised a greater cause
Three years ago we perfected our skills
Flying Snow insisted on going ahead
Together, we stormed the palace
She asked why I had abandoned the mission
I told her the King must not be killed
That is what calligraphy taught me
I didn' t kill the king
After that she refused to talk to me
Please abandon your plan
No
Was your sword forged in hatred?
Yes
For 10 years, the hate has only grown I can' t stop now
How can I dissuade you?
Only by killing me
Yes
Allow me to convey my conviction in three words
These words express my heart
Please consider them
Moon, give my sword to Master Nameless
Flying Snow and I will never part Neither will our swords
Allow me to say a few words
I' ve been with my master since I was eight years old
He taught me martial arts and how to be a decent person
Whatever my master does is for a good reason
The words he has given you carry a deep meaning
Master Nameless, please take his advice
What were the words he wrote?
"All under Heaven"
All under Heaven...
Broken Sword said
"The people have suffered years of warfare
"Only the King of Qin can stop the chaos by uniting all under Heaven."
He asked me to abandon the assassination for the greater good of all
He said, one person' s suffering is nothing compared to the suffering of many
The rivalry of Qin and Zhao is trivial compared to the greater cause
The person who really understands me is my most feared enemy
Alone, I have endured so much criticism
So many attempts on my life No one understands my intentions
Even my court officials see me as a tyrant
But I never imagined that Broken Sword, my arch- enemy would truly understand and appreciate my real motives
I would like to know how you mean to kill me without your sword?
By capturing yours!
This sword has protected me through all my battles
Let "All under Heaven" guide your decision
It just dawned on me!
This scroll of Broken Sword' s isn' t about sword technique but about swordsmanship' s ultimate ideal
Swordsmanship' s first achievement is the unity of man and sword
Once this unity is attained even a blade of grass can be a weapon
The second achievement is when the sword exists in one' s heart when absent from one' s hand
One can strike an enemy at 100 paces even with bare hands
Swordsmanship' s ultimate achievement is the absence of the sword in both hand and heart
The swordsman is at peace with the rest of the world
He vows not to kill and to bring peace to mankind
Your Majesty, your visions have convinced me that you are committed to the highest ideal of ultimate swordsmanship
Therefore I cannot kill you
Remember those who gave their lives for the highest ideal: peace with no more killing
Nameless went to within 10 paces of the King
He could' t fail
There can be only one reason He must have abandoned the mission
What did you say to him?
I wrote three words
What words?
"All under Heaven"
Is that all you care about?
And you
I don' t believe you
How can I convince you?
Draw your sword
You' ve misled Nameless
You' ve ruined Sky and the Kingdom of Zhao
Draw!
When we first met...
I had to prove myself to convince you
What can I do this time?
Just draw your sword!
Why didn' t you fend off my sword?
So that you' d be convinced
I always wanted to go home with you
Sadly, it won' t happen
Take good care of yourself
Why didn' t you defend yourself?
Why didn' t you defend yourself?
Why didn' t you?
No more drifting, no more roaming
I' m taking you home now
Our home
Your Majesty, permission to execute?
Permission to execute?
Your Majesty, permission to execute?
Permission to execute?
He conspired to assassinate Your Majesty
Show no mercy!
This is the law of Qin!
To conquer all under Heaven the law must be enforced
Set an example for the world!
Execute him!
Execute him!
Execute him!
Execute him!
Hail!
{y: i} Here was Troy 3000 years ago, {y: i} a city of destiny... {y: i}... so situated that it dominated {y: i} the Hellespont... {y: i}... today known as the Dardanelles.
{y: i} This was the only sea route {y: i} to and from the east.
{y: i} As a result, Troy grew prosperous... {y: i}... a tempting prize of war {y: i} for the Greek nations.
{y: i} The Trojans had long memories of the {y: i} time when the Greeks, led by Sparta... {y: i}... had pillaged and burned {y: i} the city of their fathers.
{y: i} They had prepared strong defenses {y: i} against the possibility of future assault.
{y: i} That is why new Troy, {y: i} their rebuilt city... {y: i}... was guarded by mighty walls, {y: i} an impregnable shelter... {y: i}... for a happy people in love with beauty.
{y: i} In the palace square {y: i} and the busy streets... {y: i}... the industrious citizens were enjoying {y: i} the works of peace... {y: i}... as though this carefree era {y: i} would last forever.
{y: i} There was Lord Aeneas, {y: i} nephew of King Priam... {y: i}... on his way to the palace... {y: i}... where the future of Troy {y: i} was being weighed by the royal council.
And so we' ve locked out the understanding of nations...... and we' ve locked in the poison.
Trojans jumping at every rumor...... pointing fingers at each other.
I tell you there' s only one solution.
Have your way.
Go to Sparta.
Go wherever you will...... but don' t try to drag the destiny of Troy with you.
What destiny, to live like a crab in a shell?
We live well.
We tax traders at the sea gate.
That' s our blood.
Stupidity!
We' il choke on our own fat unless we sail our ships of trade.
But how can we, when every harbor is an enemy' s?
- Oh, I' m sick of your crazy dreams.
- Careful, brother.
Paris has always been able to crack your neck.
And you can thrash us both.
- Tell him he' s a fool, Hector!
- My sons...... the fool is the man who makes a quarrel of a debate.
Paris, I bless your plan to sail to Sparta.
I know I can trust you not to beg for peace.
I' il try to convince the Greeks our power makes a treaty advisable.
I' d convince them.
I' d take 100 ships of war and burn the soil of Sparta black!
I' m sure you would, Polydorus, and create endless war.
And you, Hector, do you aspire to anything...
-... but to excel at swordplay and boxing?
- Yes, sire.
The javelin and the discus.
Hector' s a good son, Priam.
And a good husband, my lord.
Is that not sufficient glory?
By your leave, Paris' ship is ready to sail.
Do the gods approve the day and the hour?
The omens are good and also the prophecies, with but one exception.
One troubled priestess of the temple.
- My daughter.
- Don' t be angry, Priam.
- Cassandra is ill.
- Sick in the mind.
Arise, Paris...... and go.
The virgin Cassandra does make one point that causes me much concern.
Prince Paris, it appears, gives all his worship to one goddess alone.
- Aphrodite.
- I' m not sure I worship anything.
No.
Admiration is the better word.
Admiration for the beauty of a marble image.
It was not the goddess of beauty who taught us to arm against our enemies...... but Athena, the goddess of wisdom...... and the patroness of the horses of war.
Athena does not rejoice in this....
This solitary adoration of yours.
Neither is she delighted that you undertake a mission of peace.
And I suppose that evil horse of hers will spring out and trample me.
Very well.
Let it come, my lord...... if that' s the price of living in a world of fables.
Do not say that, Paris.
Do not seek peace elsewhere, dear brother...... until first you have pacified Athena.
My little Cassandra, there can be no postponement.
Give me your blessing for a happy voyage.
I cannot bless what I see in your future.
Cassandra!
- Cassandra, stop this.
- But, Father, it' s true.
What I see and feel is true.
Go, Paris.
Come, Cassandra.
- Come and rest a while.
- How can I, Mother?
Oh, I wish it hadn' t been given me...... this agony I live with.
Paris!
Paris, don' t go.
Please don' t go.
- I must sail at once.
- If you have any love for Troy...... don' t bring this dreadful thing upon us.
- And I thought you loved me best of all.
- I do, but...... the noise, the storm grows so great.
The screaming of horses, the cries of dying men.
- Take care of her.
- My dear, my dear.
Perhaps it could not be otherwise.
What must be, no one can change.
Where are we today?
Elysium?
Far from it.
We' re nearing Sparta...... a harsh military land, where a man will cut off his arm to prove he' s brave.
- I wonder what the women look like.
- My profound Cousin Aeneas.
To think deeply, Paris, one must think of women.
They bring all life into the world and much death.
- They sway the destinies of men.
- Not my destiny.
What' s the matter?
Oh, just a quickening of the breeze.
But I don' t like the hot breath of it.
Oh, it' s nothing.
Only one drifting cloud up there.
Up the mast with you!
Climb the mast!
- Drop the sail!
My prince, the ropes are fouled, and these men refuse to climb the mast.
- I' il flay them!
- No!
There' s only one way to cure these fantasies.
No, my prince, not you.
No!
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Megas!
Aphrodite.
What?
Some ship had bad luck.
She does exist.
- Who?
- The fairest goddess.
This creature is crazy.
But with a nice sort of craziness.
What was your ship?
{y: i} The Dolphin...
-... of Troy.
- A Trojan.
Cut him loose, Andros.
Maybe we can warm some life into him before we turn him over to the soldiers.
Women!
Why warm a man to cut his throat?
Cover him up, quickly.
We' re looking for our sovereign lady, the Queen of Sparta.
She came to the shore to visit a nurse of her childhood days.
- My lady.
- I left orders not to be disturbed here.
But there are certain developments which make this beach unsafe today.
A strange ship was sighted running out of the storm.
Heavy seas.
She might have been Trojan.
It' s possible she left spies.
You see Trojan phantoms everywhere.
- This was no phantom ship.
- The emblem of the royal House of Troy.
The king would want me to insist that his queen return at once.
lnform King Menelaus that Cora is taking excellent care of me.
Go along now.
Very well, my lady.
Andraste!
- Andraste, help us carry this man.
- A man, my lady?
How interesting!
- I can' t risk hiding a Trojan.
- Yes.
What if he' s a warrior and only pretending?
You must be careful.
Women who are always careful miss much in life, Andraste.
He doesn' t seem to recover.
But his heart beats.
Give him some broth, and we' il turn him over.
- Good.
- Oh, no!
They' il kill him.
- I still say good.
- And I, too, would say so...
-... if he were as unattractive as you.
- Thank you.
To whom am I indebted for this gallant defense?
Nobody of importance.
I am only a slave.
Now tell us about yourself, Trojan.
Did I mention that?
My memory is clouded.
But I do recall I thought you a vision.
A goddess.
Dear Aphrodite...... allow me to present myself.
- Prince Paris of Troy.
- We' il dispense with impudence.
You' re a bit impudent yourself for whatever you are, a slave?
- Silence!
You' re addressing -- - A slave of the palace, Andros.
Of what importance is that?
I tell you truly, I am Prince Paris.
I come to offer a treaty of peace to King Menelaus.
But of course, you don' t believe me.
My articles of identity...... all the gifts I was bringing to the Court of Sparta....
My crew won' t come near a Spartan harbor now.
They' il swear the gods hurled lightning at me.
Perhaps I do believe you.
The sea has damaged your appearance, but not your manner.
You must leave here at nightfall.
Follow the coast.
You' il reach a cove where Phoenician ships put in.
- No.
I still have a mission.
- Do as I tell you!
Our soldiers have a habit of plunging a dagger into strangers.
And why should that worry you?
The feelings of a slave are of no importance.
They are to me.
In any place but Sparta, one so fair would be a queen.
In Troy, we' d make songs about you.
King Menelaus would not permit that here.
Because you' d make his queen look plain.
She would be pained to hear you say that.
Do you know her?
She owns me.
I' m her shadow.
And I always thought I knew her.
No, I don' t believe anyone knows Queen Helen very well...
-... including Helen.
- Not even the king?
Great power doesn' t need knowledge.
Wait.
I only ask these questions...
-... because I must go to the palace.
- Don' t chance it.
I intend to be discreet, so prepare me.
If Menelaus won' t help me, I' il ask the queen.
I --
Oh, if you were old and ugly, maybe then she could help you.
But you' re not old, nor ugly.
It' s late, Andros.
We must get the fish to market.
Gladly.
If the soldiers find him here, I don' t want to be involved.
I wouldn' t mind.
We must get back to the palace, Andraste.
I' ve stayed here too long.
Promise me...... we' il meet again.
You can go back now.
Supplies, for your voyage home.
So you still hope I won' t go to the palace?
More than ever.
The kings of Greece are gathering there to consider a war against Troy.
Then my mission was well- timed.
- When will they be in council?
- Tomorrow, perhaps.
But tonight...... there are only you and l.
Under the magic of the moonlight.
Here.
See what I brought you?
My dear little slave girl...... I don' t want what you steal from the palace.
I only want what I steal from the palace.
No, my prince.
Very well, then, I' il borrow you.
But we' il be quite honest about it.
- I' il offer to buy you from the queen.
- Oh, no!
That would mean death!
Nonsense.
I' il explain to her that you' re no slave to me...... but my future Princess of Troy.
Let me go, Paris.
Don' t you believe I could love a slave?
Yes, I believe.
My heart believes and loves you.
My heart is yours, Paris, but I can never be.
You must not seek out the queen, nor anyone at the palace.
And this moment must be our last.
Don' t ask me why.
Call it magic, call it a dream.
And never speak of it to anyone.
Hear our Spartan host, King Menelaus.
- Are you sure Ulysses is coming?
- His ship was not far behind mine.
This great Ithacan refused to leave his wife and farm.
He' s so sick of war, he wouldn' t let go of the plow.
Till his child was cast in front of it, to convince him Greece' s glory...... comes before contentment.
I' il take Troy' s gold.
Not my share, brother.
Ulysses, King of lthaca!
Greetings, friend.
You' re acquainted with everyone.
Ajax, Prince of Salamis.
Nestor, King of Pylos.
Diomedes, ruler of Aetolia.
And I think you know my brother, King Agamemnon of Mycenae.
Greetings, fellow pirates.
It is a righteous war we plan, Ulysses...... a war of defensive aggression.
A neat sort of righteousness.
You think the Trojans built a citadel for peace- lovers?
Have you heard of Priam' s sons?
Polydorus begs for war!
Hector wants only a challenge.
Paris is anyone' s equal with a cestus, bow and javelin.
You believe they want peace?
All the more reason why we cannot plan without Achilles.
But he hates my brother and me --
He hates you almost as much as he loves war.
In order to lock himself from all temptation of joining with us...... he hid himself securely, in a house of women.
That' s where I found him, hiding from all persuasion...... dressed as a woman!
Did you persuade him?
Yes.
He' s here at the stables, seeing to the care of his horses.
Achilles, a blushing girl.
I shall commend him for the beauty of his face and figure.
The man who blows his own horn.
Commend him, Menelaus.
I commend you, Achilles.
And I despise you.
And you, Agamemnon.
But it seems we must unite...... so I am here to lead you.
- Lead us, Achilles?
- Of course.
I and my good friend Patroclus.
Since we were boys, we could stand alone and defy an army.
- I question that.
I, Ajax.
My imitator.
You disgusting glory- hunter.
To imitate him, I' d need to wear three layers of armor.
That' s where he gets his reputation for being invulnerable.
Silence this fool, Menelaus.
I would prefer not to be angered by him.
The truth of the matter is, his skin' s as tender as his vanity.
And especially his heel.
- He can' t even stand leather against it.
- I do not fight with my feet.
Take your ease, my prince.
I' il handle this buffoon.
Enough of this.
We must remain united.
lmpossible.
We' ve never been united, and we never will be.
Keep my horses ready.
Patroclus, we shall leave.
I see no ethical purpose for a raid on Troy.
- Nor I.
- Now, wait.
Here.
You talk of ethics.
Here' s the sign of a Trojan ship prowling our shores.
No peaceful trader, but a royal ship of the House of Priam.
It was my ship, sire.
I am Paris of Troy.
- You are King Menelaus?
- Yes.
Sorry to present myself like this, I was swept overboard in the storm.
Fortunately, this gathering of the most royal of Greece...... makes my mission easier.
- How' d you know we were here?
- I beg my lord' s indulgence, I know.
So I' m saved from journeying to each king...... if you decide against offers of peace I bring from Troy.
- What?
- Troy does not plan war?
You are wrong, Menelaus.
Stop this or lose your Trojan plunder.
- Where' d you find this impostor?
- He came to the palace.
- I thought you' d question him.
- You interrupt council!
- Hear him.
- This is our business.
He' s only some wandering vagabond.
See the rags he wears.
These roving jesters come often to my palace.
And they never fail to have some nimble talent.
What do you do besides this royal imposture?
It seems I try to do the impossible.
The cesti.
If he' s Paris, he should have some skill with the cesti.
- Brilliant, brother, brilliant.
- You heard, Ajax, Achilles?
Achilles is weary from travel.
Achilles did not make his reputation fighting children.
This Sparta, my son, is a viper' s nest.
- I' il see you aren' t -- - If we offend the pretender...
-... I give him leave to go.
- No.
After all, part of my task was to spread civilization.
But I must exact an agreement.
If I come fairly out of this fight, will you believe that I am Paris...... and hear the Trojan peace terms?
If your head' s still on your shoulders, yes.
Paris!
My good Trojan, you have used a Spartan persuasion on me: courage.
My courage almost failed me at the thought of meeting Ajax.
You shall rest.
And tomorrow we shall talk.
About your adventures, your voyage...... and the secret charm that makes me call you "friend."
And Troy shall call Sparta "friend."
Alpheus, find quarters for our guest.
And, Alpheus...... they say the Trojans have great eyes for beauty.
Find him a slave and see that she is beautiful.
There is one slave in your palace for whom I' d gladly become a slave myself.
Menelaus!
You expressed a wish yesterday to present your guests to me.
A proud wish.
Helen, Queen of Sparta, wife to Menelaus...... I present Paris, Prince Royal of Troy.
Why are you here, Trojan?
To study our arts and culture?
Yes, my lady.
The art of self- preservation.
Trojan impudence!
By your leave, my lord...... I shall receive the Greeks at some happier moment.
I heard my lady was truly Spartan this afternoon.
My heart behaved like a fool.
I' m sure Menelaus could hear it beating.
Tell your servants to go.
You may go.
- Get out!
- When will you learn?
The man can neither speak nor hear.
What did you think of the Trojan?
- You saw what I thought.
- Yes, I saw what you thought.
Of this Trojan anyway.
What is this game you' re playing?
Helen, you reveal yourself.
So does he.
Speak plainly.
If I' ve given you some offense, punish me...... but don' t welcome a stranger with one hand and strike him with the other!
So now we' re fond of Trojans?
I might do many things with him.
I might send him home...... with his appearance altered.
I might hold him hostage to bleed tribute out of Priam.
I imagined once I had married a king.
- You married a king.
- I married a robber.
Why did you marry him?
Why did you marry him?
When a king takes spoils, he robs no one.
When he kills, he commits no murder.
He fulfills justice.
The way of a Spartan.
I understand these things.
You do not.
I understand enough.
Then understand your place in the palace, nowhere else!
You' ve seen this man before.
Admit it.
Your silence condemns you.
You' ve been out of the palace secretly.
Admit it.
You know this man.
Silent as ever.
I am your husband!
- Don' t.
- Say "husband" to me.
Say "husband" to me.
I can think of many ways of dealing with your Trojan, Helen.
Andraste.
I am the slave sent to the Prince of Troy.
The queen' s handmaiden, eh?
The king commands me to entertain his guests.
A fine Greek custom, but guest?
He' s in a prison, if he only knew it.
Oh, I' m instructed that he shall not know it.
Must King Menelaus command you himself to admit me?
The royal temper' s already running a fever.
Shall I tell the king you said that?
Get to your business, you little troublemaker.
You should be in bed.
Yes, I should but --
But your mistress sent you to play another trick on me.
No.
She sent me to help you escape.
Escape?
Those two soldiers on watch down there...... are they going to help me too?
You' re a captive.
The king plans tortures for you.
You must leave quickly.
Return to the fisherman' s hut.
I' il go a distance with you to point the way.
My good friend Menelaus.
- The door is also watched.
- Then what chance have I?
Helen thought to make you look like a merchant.
Any fool could see you' re a prince.
- Soldiers.
- Fisherman!
- Yes?
- Fisherman!
Yes?
- What do you want?
- A cup of wine.
- Our throats are salted by the breeze.
Cora, the wineskin.
Does he think the man will swim?
He' d be deep in the forest by now.
Here.
Take it with you.
Go, and remember, there will be soldiers above...... so you' d best try the rocks under the cliff.
Get to a cove beyond the tower.
There, a boat will send you to the ship.
Wings of Mercury speed you.
Why do you wait?
It was just a foolish hope.
- I half- imagined she' d come.
- Here?
What more, Trojan?
I didn' t really expect her to come.
- I only hoped.
- Don' t even breathe it.
If she should show her face here and be recognized....
I know.
And I wish I could repay you for your kindness.
And for the queen...... tell her she' il walk in all my dreams.
Wait!
The ship is not yet in the cove.
Helen.
Andraste, you are free.
- Go as far away as you can from Sparta.
- My lady.
You made clear to Adelphus what I said?
- He is far off by this time.
- Then be on your way.
Freedom is made of quicksilver sometimes.
Go.
Hurry.
Helen.
Helen is the queen.
The girl you thought you knew was quite nameless and without reality.
I can' t believe that.
- It was she who helped me to escape.
- No.
That was the queen who hates cruelty.
She would have done the same for any slave.
I see.
She is the queen who comes here to say this.
She will always remember the gentle Paris.
And she will do her small part to turn this nation from war.
- You' re not a Spartan.
- I am.
Daughter of a king who chose a Spartan husband for me.
A man you despised.
I despise oppression, as do many others here.
We need to be Spartan to endure it.
And we need to be understood.
You are.
You, not Menelaus, will be Sparta to me.
I' il tell my father there' s still hope.
I' il tell Troy what I' ve seen and heard.
The rulers divided, unable to find cause for war...... even the Spartan people.
The kings have been carousing all night.
And so she is real, that one I loved.
Yes.
The gods sometimes change the bravest of intentions.
They are kind.
I' il never doubt them again.
Oh, Helen.
Helen, you are a slave as long as Menelaus possesses you.
Come away to freedom.
Come to Troy with me.
And destroy the hope of peace you were taking home with you?
No.
If even one Trojan dies on the walls, I' m a failure.
Forgive me, Helen.
You are two women, both wise and good.
I am two men.
One fairly good, I try to believe.
The other, very bad indeed.
One is a man.
The other just a boy, I think.
Paris, let him be so always.
Never let him grow old.
Helen.
The ship.
And now I must go back.
It is a way the gods have...... to give with one hand and take with two.
Oh, no.
This is not goodbye.
You shall still be with me across the sea.
And you with me.
And always young, Paris, remember?
What is remembered is forever young.
Halt!
Stand still, Trojan.
- My lady, I ask you remove yourself -- - Send your archers away.
I beg the queen to stand out of danger.
You wouldn' t dare.
You' il die.
I can no more than lose my own life, and it' s lost if I let him go.
Silence!
Helen!
Helen!
Helen!
- You lie.
She' s in there.
- She' s in there.
Break the locks!
- Break them.
Break.
It' s true.
The Trojan' s taken Helen.
He' s carried her away.
By force, against her will.
To think of her struggles, her fruitless cries for help.
We had our differences, but she was my wife.
It goes deeper than that.
This is the assault of all women in Greece.
Shame.
Shame on every Greek nation.
Then man your ships.
Follow them.
Ulysses, why do you sit?
She must be restored to me.
- Not now, Menelaus.
Later.
- Yes.
Now, now, now!
Will you not stand with me?
Menelaus, we will reclaim her, and with her, all the loot of Troy.
But only if you wait.
We' il send out a call to every city in Greece.
All Greeks united in a war of honor.
Yes.
That' s what the future will call it.
I call it that now.
This Prince of Troy has asked for war, not peace.
Ulysses.
I' m sure you' il agree with me that it is my duty to become our leader.
Leader?
I' il see no one but Achilles as leader.
It is my consecrated duty to become our leader to avenge my dear brother.
Quite, quite, Agamemnon.
And I will follow you.
And tell you what to do, as usual.
And I will persuade the sensitive Achilles...... with certain fascinating facts...... about the great store of gold to be found in Troy.
I seek no treasure.
I will kill.
So shall we all, brother.
To defend your honor.
Who are they?
I don' t know, but I know the color of their gold.
Sparta is the past, Helen.
Troy is this way.
What will they call us there?
A woman who left her husband.
A prince turned thief.
What else can we ever be?
Two people in love.
Against the world, if need be.
If I could make a bargain with the gods...... we would escape the world...... never landing on any shore.
A lovely dream, but somewhere we must land.
Paris, there' s an island called Pelagos.
The sea can feed us.
And there are little houses near the village well.
Let' s go there.
I cannot.
I was born to an obligation.
Paris, son of Priam, heir to responsibility.
I could leave the kingdoms of the world and never miss them.
- But you -- - Helen...... our life together will fade if I run from this.
It will become a slight thing that any storm can tear apart.
No, Paris.
Forgive me.
I forget you are a woman, not a goddess.
Captain.
- You know the island of Pelagos?
- It' s far southward...
-... through the Cytherean straits.
- Sail southward.
- Captain.
- Yes?
We have decided otherwise.
Sail north to Troy.
- What is it?
- You' il have to see, Lord Aeneas.
Wait.
Aeneas, call the queen.
Paris!
Paris.
Come and meet my brothers.
Hector, Polydorus.
I told you about them.
Lucky Paris.
You could fall in the black pit of Hades...... and come out with arms full of sunshine.
He' s always had a fine flair for surprises.
I' m happy to see that you diverted your mission...... to an enterprise more to your talents.
Come.
- Aeneas.
- Paris.
- Paris.
- I should have had faith.
The great god Zeus would never let him die...
-... and with him our hopes of peace.
- It' s a miracle.
Tell us what happened, Paris.
Here is your miracle.
I would never have seen Troy again but for her.
It would have taken a sea sprite to save you.
How could one so tender have managed it?
Postpone your questions.
She suffered an ordeal that I shan' t relate in her presence.
It' s enough that our son has been given back to us by you, my dear.
You are welcome, my child.
Paris, call the high steward.
See that she is made comfortable.
Later, you shall tell me of your adventures.
At your command, Father.
My brother seems to have forgotten his courtliness.
By what name, my lady, shall we know you?
- My name is -- - Her name is death.
- Cassandra!
- Forgive her.
She suffers an illness.
Wait.
You were going to say?
I am Helen, Queen of Sparta.
The wife of King Menelaus?
- His wife no more.
- The goddess of beauty, Aphrodite...... come down to Earth in mortal form.
She will bring the disaster I have prophesied.
Her name will be written in letters of fire.
Helen.
Helen of Troy.
And she saved my life again...... but at such risk to herself that I couldn' t leave her...... to the mercy of the Spartans.
I can see I' ve troubled you, sire.
But in your affection for me and mine for you...... I hope you will judge me fairly.
I would never have believed that this could happen...... not through this son of mine.
This son who shared my hope of everlasting peace.
Who promised he would bring it.
And what have you brought?
Dishonor.
You have united the Greeks.
You have kindled a flame that will weld them together against us.
This will bring them to our very shores.
That should delight you.
You may have to answer for the death of many a good Trojan.
You have presumed too much upon our affection.
Paris...... send her back to Sparta and make your peace with Menelaus.
I' il never send her back.
- You reject every word of wisdom?
- My love has no logic.
It could only choose between Troy and Pelagos.
Helen wanted to go to Pelagos...... but I had to bring you the warning.
And she had the courage to come with me.
But she was right.
There is no heart in Troy.
We' il seek it elsewhere.
The coward' s way to avoid the fight?
- You exceed the rights of a brother.
- And you....
You scorn every Trojan duty.
The damage is done.
It matters not.
- I shall not see you again.
- Priam.
Bring to the council chamber the armory masters and the granary stewards.
Tell them I want an estimate of Troy' s ability to withstand a siege.
There were times when I almost forgot that I had other children, Paris...... others to die, perhaps.
Destiny, Paris.
Destiny.
Every Trojan woman with son or husband will curse you.
Well, don' t worry, brother, a war may clear the atmosphere.
War, the only thing that could make you happy.
Keep out of my way, or you' il never live to enjoy it.
- Lord Aeneas.
- You may go.
The ship that brought you to Troy is still in the harbor.
My charioteer will take you there.
I see.
Or if my lady prefers, I' il arrange for a royal escort.
No, I won' t delay.
Wait for us.
My chariot will be in the courtyard.
Athena wields much power, it seems.
- If I return to Menelaus -- - No.
Pelagos?
Yes, I' il take you to Pelagos.
You said our lives would fade if you ran away.
I also said that you' d be happy in Troy.
Paris, the word has spread.
- They are not armed with flowers.
- Quick, before they overrun the courtyard.
They won' t as long as they enjoy their carnival.
- Take Helen to the harbor.
- Don' t show yourself to them.
- See her aboard the ship.
- Paris!
Dog!
You expect us to fight a war for your amusement?
My brave Trojans...... will you show as much spirit against the Spartan army...... as against one Spartan woman?
Can you stand alone, each, in battle...... or do you need the cowardice of numbers to make you bold?
Go home and search your hearts, Trojans...... for all this must be answered soon.
- You can leave safely now.
- Without you?
I' ve gained a victory of a sort tonight.
I mustn' t lose it, Helen.
There' s no Pelagos if I' m there alone.
But there' s always one island where the storm can' t touch us.
It' s anyplace, Paris, where we' re together.
- Here?
- Oh, yes, even here.
The Trojans prepared for war.
Our signals have never warned of so many ships.
We' re ready.
- Hundreds.
- Many more than we can count.
- Five, 600.
More.
- No less than 1000 ships.
- We' il make them pay a heavy price.
What shall we pay?
Aeneas, bring them here.
Let them see.
Yes, sire.
Faster.
Faster.
- See what you have brought upon us?
- Father.
The face that launched 1000 ships.
Now remember, these Trojan walls are our strength and our substance...... so let no eager fool attempt to charge this plain...... until these ramparts have served their purpose.
Well, to your posts.
Hector, where is my place?
Beside your Spartan woman.
Come with me, brother.
I' il share Spartan blood with you.
You can have my share.
No Trojans to greet us?
I had hoped they' d be foolish enough to scatter their forces.
- Where do we make camp, Agamemnon?
- Camp?
No, onwards.
Every moment of delay, my Helen suffers.
Our camp is the Trojan palace.
We must attack at once.
No.
We must equip to take this fortress.
Ulysses is right.
We must prepare.
{y: i} The canny counsel of Ulysses prevailed.
{y: i} The Greeks consolidated their beachhead {y: i} and built machines for attack... {y: i}... on a scale big enough {y: i} to match the Trojan walls.
Follow Achilles!
Hector.
Back!
- We' re outflanked!
Fall back!
Return to your towers.
Back!
Back!
Polydorus.
It' s a good war, Paris.
Hector, the man of peace...... now our greatest warrior.
Thank Helen for your destiny.
- Thank Paris.
- I thank him for my life.
Oh, great Zeus, king of all...... we give to you Polydorus, Prince of Troy.
I pray you, judge him with compassion and understanding.
Let not Athena' s hatred feed on my defenseless son...... but on our sorrow here.
We, the living dead of Troy, shall pay his debt...... in the years of siege to come.
{y: i} And the Greeks did prepare {y: i} for years of siege.
{y: i} They unloaded provisions {y: i} from their ships... {y: i}... and as time went on {y: i} they looted and raped... {y: i}... the small surrounding villages.
Take your hands off her!
- A warrior commanding his commander?
- She' s mine.
Great as you are, I' m still your chieftain, protector of all the spoils of war.
- Take her to my quarters.
- No.
Agamemnon, if you take this girl, I shall sail home.
Fly.
- Agamemnon!
- He didn' t mean that, Achilles.
- Sail home, great warrior.
No, Achilles.
Out!
Out!
Out!
Achilles, Agamemnon does not speak for all our people.
Dogs!
Jackals!
I' il never fight his battles again.
But for Greece, you' il fight.
No more.
{y: i} During these years of stalemate, {y: i} the Trojans... {y: i}... from the safety of their walls, {y: i} constantly harassed the invaders... {y: i}... with night raids on their camps.
- Helen, how perfect.
- The girl you fell in love with?
Always keep that image with you, Paris.
I have the source of its magic.
Right here, I hold its living warmth...... and its spirit is always with me on the ramparts.
Then it can' t be lost, can it?
What has been lived and shared is never lost.
- Never, Helen.
- But if you should lose me...... could you resign yourself to that?
Don' t worry, nothing will happen to you.
Nothing endures on Earth, Paris, neither sorrow nor happiness...... or people in love.
Dear Helen, she looks for shadows in the one bright place in Troy.
People in love should not be blind.
They should look to the future and prepare for separation.
But not so gloomily, my love.
I' il meet you in Elysium...... where an age of years is just a wink of time.
You charter a ship.
I' il take the flying horse, Pegasus.
To our island, Paris?
Oh, goddess come to Earth, make me immortal with your kiss...... and we' il live on nectar and ambrosia.
- But I' m not sure I like being so ethereal.
- Nor I.
How many years, fellow Trojans, shall we suffer?
Our only respite, a truce to burn our dead.
The holiday of a Troy that once knew happy times.
Must the Trojans always set their funeral pyre so near this house?
- How long will they accuse me?
- They lost many loved ones, my lady.
Lulled by the promises of peace forever.
I, for one, believe we might have had that peace....
I thought I could escape from it, but there is no place --
- And no victory for anybody.
Leave me.
Paris commanded me to stay with you while he' s on duty.
Leave me, I tell you.
No, friends!
Hear me, Trojans.
Cast her to the Spartans.
Cast Paris out of Troy.
- If you haven' t the fiber for this....
- Helen, don' t go out.
Their mood is dangerous.
I' ve sent soldiers to disperse them.
- You' ve come to ask me to leave Troy.
- No, Helen.
No.
But for Paris, I would have lost Hector.
I must love my sons equally...... and whomsoever they love.
You are good.
The high priest says that even the gods fight each other.
Some for Athena and Greece, some for Troy and Aphrodite.
How, then, could I blame you for this war?
- I could stop it.
- No one could.
I could...... if I return to the Greeks, to Menelaus.
Go back to someone you so despise?
If it brings an end to war and restores Paris to the love of the Trojans....
- He' d never let you go.
- And could I ever leave him?
- You must help me to decide.
- Would you defy the Fates?
No mortal should attempt so much, Helen.
And yet I wonder...... is one so lovely quite mortal?
Lovely?
No.
I am everything I was determined not to be.
I have only been selfish.
All the despair, the pain and the tears I' ve brought.
How different from that island dream.
Return to your King of Troy...... and tell him we will receive Helen at the appointed place.
But warn him there must be no treachery or deceit.
I assure you, my lord, no deceit exists.
It is her wish to return to King Menelaus.
- It' s her wish.
You hear that, brother?
- I' ve heard it often.
Wait, herald.
Tell your master from Menelaus that we demand --
No, no, no.
Nothing else.
Nothing else, only the return of Helen.
The Trojans wish to make peace.
As men of peace, we accept their offer.
Have we suffered to return empty- handed?
Empty- handed, Menelaus?
With Helen returned, integrity satisfied?
You are too outspoken, brother.
When the Trojans have handed over Helen, we' il teach them...... that we' re not easily bought off.
But I' d like Achilles with us, in case they prove troublesome.
He still refuses to fight so long as you' re in command...... and your lovesick jackass of a brother brays upon this beach.
Then he' il get not one obol of Trojan tribute.
Helen?
Helen.
- Where is she?
- She' s not here, Paris.
Not here?
Where?
She' s gone to the camp of the Greeks.
To Menelaus?
She was determined to end the destruction...... and restore you to the hearts of the Trojans.
- And you conspired with her -- - She was not a captive here, Paris...... but a woman of self- determination, a queen with more courage...... than I would have had to sail against the tides of heaven.
- He shan' t take her.
- The hour has passed, Paris.
You can' t prevent it.
Wait, Trojans.
You' ve returned the wife of Menelaus, but that isn' t all your debt.
Debt?
- We recognize no claim of debt.
- No?
Then who pays for the Greek blood shed on this plain?
Trojan blood has paid in full.
Trojan blood is not valid currency in Sparta...... nor does it pay for launching 1000 ships.
The terms of this truce were clear.
The return of Helen, in exchange for which...... you agreed to sail from these shores.
- You trusting fools.
Half the treasury of Troy before we depart...... and after that, 1000 talents every year.
Take these nobles as security!
- Here' s payment, Menelaus!
- To the gates with her!
Bring her back to Troy!
Follow them!
After them!
After them!
Back!
Turn back!
Don' t go too close to the Trojan walls.
Not against Hector.
Patroclus!
Patroclus!
- Bring me my armor.
- Yes, master.
Thank you, Trojan, for bringing us the body of Patroclus.
Thank you very much.
My son, Greek treachery has proved that theirs is not a war of honor.
Helen, through you, we have learned that they seek plunder, not justice.
I ask forgiveness of you both.
Cassandra...... we have found there is great wisdom in you.
- What more can you tell us?
- New storms shall ride the sky...... but the guilt will be Athena' s, not Helen' s.
- Thank you, Cassandra.
- Such courage must not go unrewarded.
Helen, you will be a princess of Troy.
Where is Hector and Andromache?
They are to bestow the laurels.
Where is Hector?
By the Scaean gates, sire.
He anticipates a call to single combat for the death of Patroclus.
I killed him.
Any Greek challenge would come to me.
But Hector didn' t want you to be challenged by Achilles.
- He was devoted to Patroclus.
- Hector sent him his friend' s corpse...... with personal compliments.
No one can match Achilles, not even Hector.
This must not happen.
He cried like an animal in grief, my lord, and then called for his armor.
Ah, so he comes.
Hector!
Hector!
- It is done, Andromache.
- Achilles?
By his hand, my father and my brothers fell.
- While you live, I still have them in you.
- I intend to live, Andromache, for you...... and for our son.
This helmet always frightens him.
Let' s pray that he may never need one...... that he finds peace.
Arms to bear.
If Achilles wins, we move.
We strike at once!
To the palace!
And if Achilles dies, we retire to consider a certain plan of mine.
- There' s an immortal shield around him.
- Mighty Zeus, help me find a weakness.
Achilles is dead!
So dies Greek courage, but not Greek cunning.
Defeated by men, deserted by the gods.
I used to number the months by a battle, a pestilence, a famine.
Now it' s all one long nightmare.
I fought wars since most of you were sucklings, but never one like this.
Let' s take our ships and sail back home.
That we shall do.
I have a plan that first required a Trojan victory.
- That much, at least, is accomplished.
- You speak treason.
As you will, but let' s be realistic.
The greatest army on Earth has lost its war.
What are you dreaming, Ulysses?
I' m dreaming of my wife, the good, constant Penelope.
And in my dreams, I see myself returning to her with all the treasures of Troy.
- But how?
- Has this anything to do with the work...... that Apagos and his men have been doing in the woodlands?
They' re building a monument to the triumph of Paris and Helen.
A gift from the goddess Athena.
A sacred horse, so big and so beautiful...... that Troy cannot help taking it to her heart.
Remember, blow the retreat loud enough for Troy to hear.
Let the ships sail but keep sufficient force in the woodlands.
The ships will return at dawn.
Are you sure the Trojans will take this monstrosity into the city?
I promise.
Their gratitude to Athena for her victory will be tremendous.
And they' il give a loving welcome to her wondrous horse.
And to Bacchus, the god of grapes.
Make ready, men of Greece!
First they sounded retreat, and now the call to man the oars.
Their torches are moving back to the sea.
- Aboard the ships?
- We' il soon know.
Lord Aeneas has gone to the shore with scouts.
Sire, they' ve sailed.
The last of their ships has gone to sea.
Sound the cry!
Carry it through the streets.
Good, Priam.
Good.
- Our heroes would wish us to rejoice.
- Light the victory torch!
You' il see a Troy you' ve never known before.
I see it in your faces.
Open it!
Open it!
Let us look at the world again!
The night smiles on us.
Look, Priam.
I was trying to tell you of it, sire.
Some strange monument that the Greeks have left at our doorstep.
Beware the Greeks bearing gifts.
My sister speaks truly.
It is a thing of evil that should be burnt upon the plain.
I agree.
The enemy doesn' t give joyful presents.
My children, this is no gift from the Greeks...... but a symbol of worship they had to abandon.
Sire, the people beg permission to bring this amazing prize into the square.
They have fought long and bravely.
I cannot deny them.
Father, please hear me.
It is not the end of ruin, but the beginning.
We must not be ungrateful...... to a goddess who has proved herself our goddess.
Bring in her sacred horse.
It shall be a monument to Trojan valor.
Yes, sire.
It is a great and perfect thing.
How childish I was to have misgivings.
And I to be afraid of a wooden giant.
What was that for?
Athena.
So forgiving of a rival goddess.
Are you jealous, Aphrodite?
I' m only Helen...... who wonders if she' il ever be a Trojan, really.
When the Trojan people look upon that plain...... won' t they always think of Helen of Sparta?
There is peace everywhere now.
We' re not bound to remain here.
Wherever you wish to go, Helen, I' il take you.
Hail to Prince Paris and his Helen!
Hail to Helen!
- All hail to Paris!
- Hail to Helen!
Destiny, Paris.
Destiny.
There is no escape, it seems.
Not even from happiness.
No, and I am happy.
Very happy.
Men of Sparta!
Men of Sparta, to the palace!
Forward!
Troy is lost, but you must not die.
While the Greeks plunder, make for the north gate.
- Do you think I would leave you now?
- Or I?
Obey your king.
Aeneas, take care of Andromache and my grandson.
Paris, Helen...... I command you, go.
Magnificent leadership, Agamemnon.
Athena will reward you with all the glory.
All of you, break in!
Helen!
Take them!
The rest of you, search!
Find her!
- Don' t let me get lost, Paris.
- Never.
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Oh, Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
I thought I was lost!
The gods are with us.
Come.
Paris!
For a moment, I thought...
-... that you were that little slave girl.
- Oh, I am.
Whatever your love wishes me to be, whatever is in your heart.
You are my heart.
Paris.
No.
My ship has returned for you.
Go there.
Wash his blood from you.
That can never be.
It' s my blood.
{y: i} It can 't be lost, Paris, can it?
{y: i} What has been lived {y: i} and shared is never lost.
{y: i} Never, Helen.
{y: i} Then this is not goodbye.
{y: i} You shall always be with me.
{y: i} And you with me.
And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.
Revelation - Chapter 12: 4
Just like in the forecast data.
Excuse me.
I hope the anesthesia did no harm to her.
Sir, Deunan Knute is secured!
Such a beauty...
8 hours 12 minutes, she slept so long.
This legendary soldier is so cute even when she' s asleep.
About what happened to your body?
She will be surprised!
When we get to the Utopia.
Utopia, eh...
Did we get the landing permit from Olympus A5?
Don' t get too close before ID is confirmed or the multi- legged cannon will fire at us.
Here is Olympus A5.
Lading permit confirmed.
ESWAT109 landing.
Briareos
I' il take a look up ahead.
I will go with you.
You stay here.
Don' t worry.
I' il be back soon.
Briareos...
Such a detailed inspection this time.
According to the order from legislative institute.
Still sleeping... perhaps wrong dosage of anesthesia?
Don' t move or I' il break your neck!
Deunan Knute, second team captain, stand down!
Briareos
I can' t believe it.
Can' t blame you.
But this is the truth...
So after such a large scale World War, there is no winner?
Yes.
After that, the previous administration took over.
In other word, Olympus is now controlling this world.
That means I blindly kept fighting for months with no cause?
That' s how war is, isn' t it?
But it' s different here.
Olympus is the ideal government that mankind has search for ages.
Why brought me here?
Because you are an elite soldier.
Your name on the top of ESWAT' s human enhancement list.
My mission is to bring people on the list from outside world to Olympus.
ESWAT?
I know you must have lots of questions.
But, please take a good rest tonight.
We will continue tomorrow.
I will show you around the city.
I' m sure Deunan you will fall in love with our Utopia.
Here is the bedroom.
Haven' t slept on a soft bed for a long time, haven' t you?
I' il pick you up at 10 am tomorrow.
You are Hitomi, right?
Yeah.
Haven' t we meet before?
I don' t think so.
Good night.
When...
In the battle of North Africa,
I lost my body.
It' s been over one year.
Don' t let them get it.
Call me if you have trouble.
Briareos
Do you know those who attacked me?
No.
So sad.
Athena you arranged that attack, didn' t you?
It' s impossible for the mercenaries to confront with ESWAT.
Did you forget the mission of Bioriod?
General Uranus will be pleased.
We won' t be able to control them by ourselves.
Gaia might have reached its limit.
Athena, we don' t have much time left.
Nike
They' ve found out.
I' m so sorry.
Nike
We need our man inside ESWAT.
I' il prepare right now.
But the worst is,
we didn' t find that thing.
It' s not yet the time to use the last resort.
But the fire has to be put out before it grows.
Secure Deunan Knute by all means!
Yes sir!
Human is such a strange creature that will fall into its own traps.
Never thought Captain Hades will be here personally.
Imagine how ESWAT is chasing after the fake information...
Preparation is 98% finished.
Wonderful...
The problem of special part on the leg was also solved.
General Uranus will be pleased.
Now, Bioriod won' t be able to do as they wishes.
We should not be protecting wolves. instead we should protect the sheep like human, shouldn' t we?
Indeed that' s the principle for our first generation Bioriod.
However some wolves are under sheep' s skins.
So sad.
We' ve already known the answer to this.
Even then, we have to debate with Gaia like this.
Then let' s continue to debate with Gaia.
Deunan
Briareos
Morning, Deunan.
It fits well.
Come on, let' s go.
Your entry permit was approved this morning.
So Deunan you are offically a member of our Olympus.
Beautiful city, isn' t it?
Comparing with where I was yesterday, it' s like a dream.
From today on, this is the reality.
Everyone seems happy.
Because in this city 50% population are Bioriod.
Bioriod?
Man- made human.
Clones?
No, not simple clones, but man- made human with carefully selected human gene.
Does it mean that the city is controlled by clones?
It' s not polite to say "clone".
I am a Bioriod myself.
Bioriod doesn' t control human.
Bioriod aims to coexists with human peacefully. and become an integral part of human to human relations.
Half of them are Bioriod...
This car is sort of strange.
The experimental ultravibrate gravity system is installed on this car.
Ultravibrate gravity?
Yes, like hovering.
It' s said the driver would have a longer life.
So the ultravibrate gravity control technology is finished.
But, you control the car by that steering wheel?
In this city, the use of automation technology has reached such level, this wheel is a symbol of the "for the people" idea.
Simple theory, complicated structure, makes human more human.
What' s that all about?
City planners used to say that.
That is the symbolic building.
Tarutarus and Tartarus.
Inside there, an enormous I. N. structure that controls Olympus.
I. N.?
Means "Intellectual Network".
Commonly called Gaia.
Gaia grows with the network and monitors all of Olympus.
Especially we Bioriod.
Why?
Human has emotions.
They argue and start wars.
Bioriod is restrained on emotions.
They don' t hate others so there won' t be any fighting.
On the top of Tarutarus, there is a perfect defense system protecting the "D- Tank" virus storage system
It' s the product of human defense instinct.
But it' s a insult to Bioriod.
You mean human is more dangerous.
So the balance between human and Boiriod is more important.
Gaia monitors the effect of the Bioriod with human.
But the one being monitored are still human being.
You spoke like General Uranus.
Who is General Uranus?
General commander of Olympus military.
An extremist that hates Bioriod.
An being that' s unfit in Utopia.
Bioriod controls Olympus.
Premier Athena is a Bioriod too.
Athena?
You know her?
Probably not.
Premier is just like the president.
However the military is controlled by human.
Scary, right?
Recently the ESWAT under Athena' s control is growing bigger.
The relations with military has gone from bad to worse.
But all decisions of Olympus are controlled by Gaia.
Something wrong?
We' ve got company.
Hitomi, are you okay?
Sure.
But they are...
They sure know what to do.
So I am the target.
No question about it.
Such is the reality.
Briareos.
Cannot unseal the Apple Seed.
How are you doing, grandpas?
Hitomi, are you alright?
Are you hurt?
I am okay.
And I bring you the long awaited Deunan Knute.
Ahh, the legendary beauty!
Goddess of fighting.
You have the same eyes like Carl.
You know my father?
Not only that,
Most Bioriod in Olympus have inherited part of Carl Knute' s gene.
That means Hitomi is your sister.
We heard you met some unpleasant things.
Recently, it' s very complicated to control people from outside.
We are worried that the balance will be broken.
First let' s introduce Gaia to you.
Enemies of the general...
The legislative institute and administrative institute began to confront each other over the issues of Bioriod population increasing, etc.
Athena is really targeting Carl' s daughter?
Absolutely.
All the preparation is done.
It' s level 5.
General, Please make a decision!
Human cannot be the tool of souls any more.
This is Gaia.
Gaia lets the network grow and controls Olympus.
Gaia speaks with the seven elders and the conclusion becomes the consciousness of Olympus.
Gaia is the combine product of many scientists' intelligence and consciousness.
It' s absolute stable, a reliable tool.
But it has no emotions and no feelings.
Only if combine with seven elder' s feelings
Gaia could think more like a human.
But recently you have very different opinions with Gaia.
Our work is to argue with Gaia.
The conclusion of the debate can lead Olympus to the correct direction for future development.
Deunan, you were still in battlefield yesterday, right?
What did you fight for?
Well...
That' s why we built Olympus.
The last hope for human being is the coexistence of human and Bioriod.
Gaia continously monitors this balance.
Bioriod is totally different from human.
Without the reproductive ability, they cannot have children.
No sex.
No love, no desire, and therefore no hatred.
However if the life- prolonging procedure is not performed regularly, they will get old really fast and die.
We wanted to make Bioriod different from human, so we supressed their reproductive ability, and changed their life cycle.
Hitomi, aren' t you late for the life- prolonging procedure?
No problem, I will have it done there soon.
Hopefully, someday Bioroids don' t have to go through such troublesome procedure.
Kudo, all your team members are dead.
You are still too young, sorry for that.
Started with only one knife, she killed 16 men in ten minutes.
You brought in a really good newcomer!
You bloat too much.
Your team members might save your life some day.
You shouldn' t say those words to them.
So long haven' t seen you, can' t you say something else?
Something nicer?
Such as "how have you been in two years?"
Or "Nice to meet you again".
Someone has an interest on you.
I know.
But why would any one be interested in me, and who are these people?
I don' t know.
What is "Apple Seed"?
I don' t know.
I don' t want hear such mechanical answer.
Sorry.
Right now, my mission is to protect you.
Mission...
Tomorrow we meet at 9.
So... you are the legendary fighter Deunan Knute.
It' s said that you died during the Great War.
Your story at the War of North Africa became a legend.
May I sit here?
Sure.
He died before the Great War.
Sorry to hear that.
Your mother?
I cannot remember anything about her.
My father didn' t tell my anything either.
You and Briareos were lovers, right?
That' s when he was still human.
So the body is more important for love.
That' s not what I mean.
But to men, the body is a sex symbol none the less.
What is it like to be in love?
Ahh...
You know Bioriod' s emotions are restrained.
So we don' t know what love feels like.
I can learn about it from the readings...
But I never experienced personally.
So I become more and more curious.
On this point, I really envy human beings.
People in love, what are they like?
The feeling of love someone.
You bastard!
You are only a Bioriod!
How dare you be in front of human!
Olympus military, annoying guys.
Always make a scene.
Synchro- test finished, No problem found.
Only thing left is to adjust the safety belt.
I want to confirm one more time before that.
The reason for the reduction of shock- absorbing is...
I said that already.
Dynamic structure can absorb shock.
But the cartilage has many structures, joints, bearings and depressor mechanism are self- restrained, they will dislocate under too much stress.
Yoshitsune, don' t worry.
This is Deunan Kunte.
But usually no woman can operate a Land Mate.
Ok, let me try.
Help me adjust the safety belt.
Deunan, Yoshitsune is the best mechanics in Olympus.
Only limited to Land Mate though.
Now you are studying the Hecatonchires structure, right?
Next time let me see the inner structure please.
Forget it, I am blushing.
All secured?
Hmmm, no problem.
Ok, this is the start switch.
First you need to practice, slowly.
Right.
What' s happening?
The emergency launch alarm.
Unidentified Land Mates invaded Gaia Research Center!
ESWAT launch immediately!
Stop wasting time, let' s move!
Ok like this is fine.
I' m moving out.
Like that?!
Deunan
Stop!
The are coming...
Targeting is...
Deunan
Hold on, don' t come here!
Drop the weapon!
Briareos
Sorry
Such foolish actions.
The third generation Bioriod are all destroyed.
The DNA system for life- prolonging procedures are all destroyed as well.
They came in from the underground elevator shaft.
Seven levels of security system are broken through in one shot.
No sign of insurgents from outside of Olympus.
We don' t know who owns those land mates.
This is too much!
Looks like it is fate that we have to take on the burden of today' s human reality.
No other choice.
From now on, block all surrounding of Tarutarus and Tartarus.
No one is permitted to access the D- Tank on the top.
Yes.
Emergency meeting right now!
And the Lord said unto Moses, ’’ Go.
Return into Egypt. ’’
And Moses took his wife and his son and he returned to the land of Egypt.
And Moses took the rod of God in his hand. ’
Let the ambassador from Priam, king of Troy, approach the Pharaoh.
Great Pharaoh, the gift of Troy is a fabulous fabric from the land of the five rivers.
Our thanks to Priam.
It is fabulous indeed.
- It shimmers like the Nile.
- How is it made?
No one knows.
It is spun on the looms of the gods.
They call it silk.
The ambassador from Jericho.
What kingdom has sent you?
The kingdom of the Most High.
- What gifts do you bring?
- We bring you the word of God.
What is this word?
Thus sayeth the Lord God of lsrael, ’’ Let my people go! ’’
The slaves are mine.
Their lives are mine.
All that they own is mine.
I do not know your God, nor will I let lsrael go.
Who are you to make their lives bitter in bondage?
Men shall be ruled by law, not the will of other men.
Who is this God that I should let your people go?
Aaron.
Cast down my staff before Pharaoh that he may see the power of God.
ln this you shall know that the Lord is God.
Mother!
He turned his staff into a cobra!
Nothing of HlS will harm you, my son.
The power of your God is a cheap magician’ s trick.
Jannes.
Mother, look!
Jannes, do you see?
Moses ’ serpent swallows up the others.
You gave me this staff to rule over scorpions and serpents, but God made it a rod to rule over kings.
Hear his word, Rameses, and obey.
Obey?
Are there no magicians in Egypt that you have come back to make serpents out of sticks?
Or cause rabbits to appear?
I will give your staff a greater wonder to perform.
Bear it before your idle people and bid them make bricks without straw.
- How can that be done?
- Let his staff provide them.
Or let them glean straw for themselves.
But their tally of bricks shall not diminish.
So let it be done.
(Man) Aaron.
Aaron, when do we leave Egypt?
We do not leave Egypt.
But Moses promised us.
But you said we’ d be freed!
I have brought more evil upon you.
God forgive my weak use of his strength.
(Man) Moses, what have you done to us?
It is Pharaoh ’ s order that you be given no straw to make your tally of bricks.
No straw?
How can we make bricks without straw?
You will glean the fields by night.
Your women and children, too.
ls this the deliverer?
You’ ve brought the wrath of Pharaoh upon us!
You put a sword in their hands!
Stone him!
Stone him!
Stand aside!
Come!
Follow!
There goes your deliverer.
Now go find your straw.
Remember the tally must be the same.
Not one brick less.
I cursed you.
Each time Rameses took me in his arms I cursed you, not him, because I love you.
The Moses who loved you was another man.
No, he was not.
You believe you’ ve changed, but you haven’ t.
You call yourself a prophet, a man of God, but I know better.
I don’ t believe only the thunder of a mountain stirs your heart, as you stir mine.
Nefretiri, I have stood in the burning light of God’ s own presence.
It was not he who saved you just now.
I did that.
Why, of all men, did I fall in love with the prince of fools?
But I believe anything you tell me when l’ m in your arms.
Why must you deny me and yourself?
Because I am bound to a God and to a people and to a shepherd girl.
A shepherd girl?
What can she be to you?
Unless the desert sun has dulled your senses.
Does she... grate garlic on her skin?
Or is it soft as mine?
Are her lips chafed and dry as the desert sand?
Or are they moist and red like a pomegranate?
ls it the fragrance of myrrh that scents her hair?
Or is it the odour of sheep?
There is a beauty beyond the senses, Nefretiri.
Beauty like the quiet of green valleys and still waters.
Beauty whose spirit you cannot understand.
Perhaps not.
But beauty of the spirit will not free your people, Moses.
YOU will come to me or THEY will never leave Egypt.
The fate of lsrael is not in your hands, Nefretiri.
Who else can soften Pharaoh ’ s heart?
Or harden it?
Yes.
You may be the lovely dust through which God will work his purpose.
Fill every jar with water.
For seven days there will be none to drink.
- But this well has never run dry.
- And the river is high.
- Whose word is that?
- One who knows.
So fill your jars or go thirsty.
- Miriam is always right.
- Yes, l’ m going back for more jars.
Yes, Joshua.
She comes to the well every day.
Wait and you will see her.
It is wise of Dathan to send you to the well, Lilia, or he might find his water poisoned.
They told me you were dead.
To all I love, Joshua, I am dead.
- Dathan?
- Yes.
Dathan.
Of your own free will?
Of my own free will.
You are no man’ s slave.
The hour of deliverance has come.
Not for me, Joshua.
Hail to thee, great god of the Nile!
Thy waters are the blood of Egypt.
Hail to thee, maker of barley, feeder of cattle, carrier of ships, greatest of all the gods.
Pharaoh of Egypt!
You have not yet obeyed the Lord.
Let my people go!
The point of the sword...
Let him rave that men shall know him mad.
Obey the Lord or he will raise his hand against the waters of the river.
I have come to bless the waters, you have come to curse them.
We will learn if a shepherd god is stronger than the gods of Pharaoh.
Water of life, give drink to the desert and make green the meadow.
Aaron.
Stretch out my staff against the waters.
Look!
Where he’ s touched the river, it bleeds.
The water turns to blood!
Blood flows from the god!
See how it spreads.
It lS blood!
That you may know the power of the Lord, for seven days, Egypt will thirst.
- Seven days without water!
- Pestilence will be everywhere!
Were it seven times seven days, no magician’ s trick will set your people free.
Sacred water, make pure the flood from which you came.
’ And God smote the land with all manner of plagues, ’ but still Pharaoh ’ s heart was hardened. ’
Great one, you hear the cry of Egypt.
They would cry louder if THEY had to make the bricks.
Send them away.
The people have been plagued by thirst, by frogs, by lice, by flies.
They can endure no more.
Why do you bring this worker of evil before me?
The people desert the temples and turn from the gods.
What gods?
You prophets and priests MADE the gods, that you may prey upon the fears of men.
When the Nile ran red, I too was afraid... until word came of a mountain beyond the cataracts which spewed red mud and poisoned the water.
Was it the staff that caused this?
Was it the wonder of your god that fish died and frogs left the water?
Was it a miracle that flies and lice should bloat upon their carrion and spread disease?
These things were ordered by themselves, not by any god!
Now go.
That you may know these things are done of God...
you shall see hail fall from a clear sky and burn as fire upon the ground.
You shall see darkness cover Egypt when the sun climbs high to noon.
And you shall know that God is God and bow down to his will.
Nothing of this Earth can make me bow to you, Moses.
Behold, the hail comes.
When darkness has covered Egypt for three days, your ministers will send for me.
ln the three days of darkness, you have whined like frightened children in the night.
Moses said the sun would shine in three days and it is true.
Let his people go, or Egypt will be barren from the cataracts to the sea.
Will my father free the slaves?
Can taxes be collected from blighted harvests?
Does fear rule Egypt... or do l?
We fear no army of the Earth, but can we fight plagues with swords?
There is no shame in this.
It is not Pharaoh who yields to the slave, but his counsellors.
I have summoned Moses at your request.
(Counsellor) People will bless you, great one.
Does the world bow to an empty throne?
Empty?
Does a Pharaoh harden his heart against his son?
lf you let the Hebrews go, who will build HlS cities?
You told Moses to make bricks without straw.
Now HE tells YOU to make cities without bricks!
Who is the slave... and who is the Pharaoh?
Do you hear laughter, Rameses?
Yes, the laughter of kings in Babylon, in Canaan, in Troy... as Egypt surrenders to the god of slaves!
Bring the Hebrew in.
Go into the garden.
lt’ s not good for a son of Pharaoh to see his father humbled by a son of slaves.
My son, stand beside me.
Have the days of darkness made you see the light, Rameses?
Will you now free my people?
Great one, bid the scribe read the order.
Give me the writing.
You cannot resist the power of his god!
I know not his god!
Neither will I let his people go.
How long will you refuse to humble yourself before God?
lf you bring another plague upon us, it is not your god but I who will turn the Nile red with blood.
As your father’ s father did with the blood of our male children!
lf there is one more plague on Egypt, it is by YOUR word that God will bring it.
And there shall be so great a cry throughout the land that you will surely let the people go.
Come to me no more, Moses, for on the day you see my face again, you will surely die.
So let it be written.
I will give this spawn of slaves and his god an answer the world will not forget!
Commander of the Host, call on the chariots from Talis.
There SHALL be one more plague... only it will come upon the slaves of Goshen!
First- born of each house shall die, beginning with the son of Moses.
You are the shepherd girl that Moses married?
The queen of Egypt lS beautiful... as he told me.
My husband is not here.
ls this Moses ’ son?
Yes, this is our son.
What do you want of us?
You need have no fear of me.
I feared only his memory of you.
You have been able to erase it?
He has forgotten both of us.
You lost him when he went to seek his god.
I lost him when he found his god.
At least he left you a son to cherish.
I am here to save his son.
From what?
From Pharaoh ’ s decree that the first- born of lsrael must die.
Die?
God of Abraham!
Don’ t let him do this!
Not to the children!
A caravan for Midian awaits you and your son.
My chariot will take you to it.
l’ m surprised you noticed me.
You didn’ t at the palace this morning.
Why?
Were you afraid to look at me?
What do you want, Nefretiri?
You, Moses.
Everything about us is coming to an end!
You will destroy Egypt or Egypt will destroy you.
I belong to you, Moses.
She’ s gone with your son to Midian.
Why did she leave?
She knew you’ d try to save the other children before your own son.
From what?
Rameses is massing the Libyan axemen, the chariots, Sardinian swordsmen.
Why?
Tell me why!
To destroy the first- born of lsrael.
Oh, God!
My God!
Out of his own mouth comes thy judgement!
But I have saved your son!
It is not my son who will die!
It is the first- born of Egypt!
YOUR son, Nefretiri!
You would not dare strike Pharaoh ’ s son!
ln the hardness of his heart, Pharaoh brings death to his own son!
But he’ s MY son, Moses.
You would not harm MY son?
I, myself, am nothing.
God’ s power uses me to work his will.
You would not let him do this to me.
I saved YOUR son.
I cannot save yours.
Your god listens to you, Moses.
About midnight, the destroyer will come into the midst of Egypt and all the first- born shall die, from the first- born of Pharaoh to the first- born of his servants.
When you were Prince of Egypt, you held me in your arms.
I threw myself at your feet before the court of Pharaoh.
Because I loved you, Moses.
It is the Lord who executes judgement, Nefretiri.
Go back to your son.
Your love for me is stronger than the power of any god.
You will not kill my son.
Turn from thy fierce wrath, O Lord!
# Death cometh to me
# To set me free
# Death cometh to me... #
No, Lilia, death will not come to you.
Joshua, you risk your life in coming here.
- You are first- born.
- So are you.
I bring lamb’ s blood to mark the doorposts and lintel... that the Angel of Death may pass you by.
Joshua, it is enough that you have come to me.
I am outcast among our people.
Don’ t save me from death, Joshua, save me from life.
Tomorrow will bring a new world.
And no blood on this door!
Dathan, it will save her life!
Moses has God’ s promise!
Moses has words, Pharaoh has spears.
Remember, Joshua, of her own free will she’ s mine.
# And under his wing shalt thou trust # ’’ Though we stand in the shadow of death, ’’ the Lord is our God.
The Lord is one. ’’ (All) ’’ The Lord is one. ’’
# His truth shall be thy shield... # ’’ Shield us through this night of terror, O King of the Universe. ’’ (Woman screams)
Why is this night different from all others?
# Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night # (Knock at door)
Pharaoh ’ s soldiers!
Or worse!
# Or from the arrow that flyeth by day #
Bithiah!
ln fear of your god they have set me free.
May a stranger enter?
There are no strangers among those who seek God’ s mercy.
My bearers?
All who thirst for freedom may come with us.
The darkness of death will pass over us tonight.
Tomorrow the light of freedom will shine upon us as we go forth from Egypt.
I shall go with you, Moses.
- A princess of Egypt!
- From the house of Pharaoh!
An idol- worshipper!
This woman drew me from the Nile and set my feet upon the path of knowledge.
Mered, bring a chair for Pharaoh ’ s daughter.
There is a great light shines from your face.
Perhaps some day I shall understand it.
He is God’ s messenger, Princess.
lf it is not forbidden to look upon the breath of pestilence, then see, for it is here.
Do not look, Eleazar.
Close the door, Joshua, and let death pass.
Will it pass, Moses?
Will it pass?
That is God’ s promise, Elisheba.
’’ Blessed art thou, o Lord our God ’’ Who bringeth forth bread from the earth. ’’ (Distant shouting)
(Man) Run!
There shall no evil befall you... or any plagues come near you.
# A thousand shall fall at thy sight #
Why do we eat unleavened bread and bitter herbs?
(Hoofbeats outside) (Man) Faster!
The herbs remind us of the bitterness of captivity, Eleazar.
This is the bread of haste, that you will remember this night from generation to generation forever.
(Woman) Give me back my baby!
- They are my people!
- All are God’ s people.
Death is all around us!
But it passes those who have believed the Lord.
Always remember, Eleazar... he passed over your house.
Are the captains of Egypt afraid of a night mist?
- The death cry is everywhere.
- Some devil’ s curse!
l’ ve known battle for 30 years, Pharaoh, but never fear till tonight.
Aide.
Have the captains join their men.
At the coming of dawn we will strike.
No first- born Hebrew shall live.
Let the Hebrews go, great one, or we are all dead men.
He was your son?
My first- born.
There is no magic cure, no spell to use.
He is the first- born of Pharaoh.
We have no skill before this... pestilence.
My father.
My son.
Your own curse is on him.
- Where did you hear this?
- From Moses.
I would not let his people go because your serpent’ s tongue hardened my heart.
You only thought to keep Moses here.
You cared nothing for my throne... or my son.
I asked Moses for his life.
The shadow of death is on his face.
No...
He will not die.
Captain.
Take my fastest chariot.
Bring Moses to me.
I will bring him, mighty Pharaoh.
He’ s my only son.
You have conquered, Moses.
The foot of a slave is on the neck of Egypt.
You were saved from the Nile to be a curse upon me.
Your shadow fell between me and my father, between me and my fame, between me and my queen.
Your shadow now fills all things with death.
Go out from among us, you and your people.
I set you free.
It is not by your word, nor by my hand that we are free, Pharaoh.
The power of God has freed us.
Enough of your words!
Take your people, your cattle, your god and your pestilence.
But go!
O Lord God... with a strong hand thou dost bring us out of bitter bondage.
Tomorrow we go forth a free nation.
For every man shall reap what he has sown and bow no knee except in prayer.
We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters...
With our flocks and with our herds will we go, for I know that the Lord is great and that our Lord is above all gods.
He’ s dead.
Soca, great lord of the lower world...
I, who have denied the gods of Egypt, bow before you now.
Show that you have power above the god of Moses, and restore the life he has taken from my son.
Guide back his soul across the lake of death to the place of living men, and I will raise a temple to you mightier than the pyramids.
Hear me, dread lord of darkness...
Arise, O lsrael!
Behold the dawn of freedom!
’ And it came to pass, after the stifling night of terror, ’ came a day such as the world had never seen. ’ From east and west, from north and south, ’ they came with all they had, driving their flocks ’ and their herds and their camels before them. ’ By tens, by hundreds, by thousands, ’ unending streams of man and beast and burden, ’ and even very much cattle, ’ poured into the Avenue of Sphinxes. ’ Beneath the stone feet of the four colossal images of Rameses, ’ which their own sweat and blood and sinew ’ had hewn from solid rock, ’ a nation arose and freedom was born into the world. ’
(Child) Father, have you got Rebekka?
No, I haven’ t got Rebekka.
Here’ s the trough.
Sling it on your shoulders.
This is a blessed day!
- Here’ s Rebekka!
- Thank you!
- Can we take the cow?
- We’ re moving to the gates.
Rachel, help me with this brick yoke.
Don’ t forget the oil for the baths!
Where are we going?
To some land flowing with milk and honey!
l’ ve never tasted honey.
Anybody know the way?
lt’ s away from the whip!
Freedom will wet your throats in the desert.
This is the governor’ s house!
You cannot enter.
Out!
All of you!
Why do soldiers come here?
I put no blood on my door.
Then stone bleeds!
Your stonecutter did this to me!
All your gold cannot wipe that mark from your door... or from my heart.
For that, you’ il walk all the way to...
Where are we going?
Do you know where we’ re going?
To hell, I hope!
’ Like Dathan, they did not know where they were going, ’ and cared no more than their flocks. ’ Now they used the brick yokes for a very different burden. ’ There went forth among them ’ planters of vineyards and sowers of seeds, ’ each hoping to sit under his own vine and fig tree. ’ Out of this glorious chaos, ’ it is Joshua who brings order and purpose. ’
Set the standard of each tribe before the people!
Levite in the centre, Judah to the right, Hephron left.
(Woman) Watch where you’ re going!
Watch out for my geese!
Aaron and the elders are carrying a shrouded body, Grandfather!
They are the bones of Joseph, to rest in his own land.
Nubians, Grandfather!
- Here come treasure wagons!
- Spoils of Egypt.
All who shared the toil will share this gold!
Here, boy!
For the blind one!
A little golden calf, Grandfather, with horns!
An idol.
For idol- worshippers!
There are the fire- bearers!
Plant your fires at night beside the standards, that all may light their torches!
Eleazar, hang this on the wagon.
Now the cradle...
I have wagons for midwives and physicians.
Place them at 5, 000 cubits...
l’ il pay you back every lash you gave me, Dathan!
- ls this a day for hard feelings?
- l’ ve felt your whip!
Lilia is no slave, Dathan!
You can carry your own carton.
(Others laugh)
So, now, my brother, we have NEW task- masters.
We serve no masters now!
Yes, but not for long.
- Here.
Old woman.
That’ s it.
- Joshua!
Make way for the governor!
- You know who I am.
- I know who you WERE.
Go and tell Rameses l’ m coming back to my house.
That rabble may follow Moses into the desert today, but when their eyes are seared red by the sun and their cracked lips bleed with thirst, when their stomachs cramp with hunger, they will curse the name of Moses and his god.
Then I will lead them back to Pharaoh and the brick pits.
There are so many.
So many.
How shall I find thy road through the wilderness, Lord?
How shall I find water in the desert for this multitude?
Moses... the people are assembled.
Then let us go forth to the mountain of God, that he may write his commandments in our minds and hearts forever.
We march, praising his mighty name!
- What is the word, Joshua?
- Let the trumpets sound!
Hear, O lsrael!
Remember this day, when the strong hand of the Lord leads you out of bondage!
(All) The Lord is our God!
The Lord is one!
The Lord is our God!
The Lord is one!
- Come on!
- Yes!
Come on!
Joshua!
400 years in bondage and TODAY he won’ t move!
# The Lord is one!
Praise to God...
# Thank thee, O Lord... #
My litter can carry him.
I am poured out like water, my strength dried up into the dust... of death.
- We shall plant your fig tree!
- Children shall eat of its fruit!
Do you hear that?
You have a strong new son!
’ And he brought forth the people with joy and gladness. ’ He bore them out of Egypt ’ as an eagle bears its young upon its wings. ’ But again...
Pharaoh ’ s heart was hardened. ’
How many more days and nights will you pray?
Does he hear you?
Dread Lord of Darkness, are you not greater than the god of Moses?
I have raised my voice to you, yet life has not come to the body of my son.
- Hear me!
- He cannot hear you.
He’ s nothing but a piece of stone with the head of a bird.
He WlLL hear me.
I am Egypt.
Egypt?
You are nothing.
You let Moses kill my son.
No god can bring him back.
What have you done to Moses?
How did he die?
Did he cry for mercy when you tortured him?
Bring me to his body!
I want to see it, Rameses!
I want to see it!
This is my son.
He would have been Pharaoh.
He would have ruled the world.
Who mourns him now?
Not even you.
All you can think of is Moses.
You will not see his body.
I drove him out of Egypt.
I cannot fight the power of his god.
The priests say that Pharaoh is a god, but you are not a god, you are even less than a man.
Listen to me, Rameses, you thought I was evil when I went to Moses, and you were right.
Shall I tell you what happened, Rameses?
He spurned me, like a strumpet in the street.
I, Nefretiri, Queen of Egypt!
All that you wanted from me he would not even take.
Do you hear laughter, Pharaoh?
Not the laughter of kings, but the laughter of slaves on the desert!
Laughter?
Laughter?
My son, I shall build your tomb upon their crushed bodies!
lf any escape, their seed shall be scattered and accursed forever!
My armour.
War crown.
Laughter?
I will turn the laughter of these slaves into wails of torment!
They SHALL remember the name of Moses, only that he died under my chariot wheels!
Kill him with your own hands.
Let the trumpet sound.
Alert the watch towers.
Assemble all the chariots at the city gate.
I obey!
Ready my chariot.
I will bring you back your temple treasure!
Bring it back to me stained with his blood.
I will!
To mingle with your own!
(Commander) Salute!
(All) Hail!
(All) Hail!
Remember your first- born!
- (All) Death to the slaves!
- Death to their god!
Hail!
Forward!
Do you hear thunder?
Over the sea?
No, it comes from the desert.
That’ s the thunder of horses!
Pharaoh ’ s chariot!
We’ re trapped against the sea!
Caleb, warn the north tents!
Joshua?
That’ s Joshua’ s horn!
All men to the pass!
Form a barrier!
What’ s the alarm?
Pharaoh ’ s chariot!
Block the pass with carts!
Women and children, to the sea!
Bring shovels!
Mallets!
Hear me!
Hear me!
Will your cart stop Pharaoh ’ s chariots?
Women, do you want your men killed?
Pharaoh ’ s chariots!
l’ ve ordered men to block the pass!
- We can’ t fight chariots!
- Order the men to move back, Joshua.
Move back?
Where? lnto the sea?
lnto the hand of God.
Deliverer?
He’ s delivered you to death!
Look!
Look!
Blame Moses for this!
Deliver him to Pharaoh!
(All) Yes!
Stone him!
The god of Moses is a poor general... to leave him no retreat.
Ten times you have seen the miracles of the Lord!
And still you have no faith!
He delivers you to death!
Stone him!
Stone him!
Listen to Moses!
He speaks God’ s will!
- They will stop for me!
- A chariot knows no rank.
Was it because there where no graves in Egypt that you took us to die in the wilderness?
Fear not!
Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord!
- A pillar of fire!
- The work of God!
Through it!
No, great one!
You cannot breach the fire of God!
Gather your families and flocks.
We must go with all speed.
Go where?
To drown in the sea?
How long can the fire hold?
After this day you shall see his chariots no more!
No!
You’ il be dead under them!
The Lord of Hosts will do battle for us!
Behold his mighty hand!
The wind opens the sea!
God opens the sea with the blast of his nostrils!
- Lead them through the waters.
- His will be done!
He opens the waters for them and he bars our way with fire.
Let us go.
Men cannot fight a god!
Better to die in battle with a god, than live in shame.
Praise God and down into it!
God has delivered us!
- Help us!
- Never mind the wheel!
Pull!
Pull for your lives!
ls your life worth so much?
Save the bread if you can!
Bring Caleb to help with the wagons!
Moses!
Stand on the rock where the people can see you and have hope!
Above us!
The fire dies!
Sound the pursuit!
Chariots, halt!
This is work for a butcher, not a Pharaoh.
Destroy them all.
But bring Moses to me alive.
Level spears!
Forward!
- Here!
Take him!
- Wait!
Wait!
Grandfather, look, the horses are coming!
The chariots!
Run!
Better to serve than to die here!
Who shall withstand the power of God?
Thou didst blow with thy winds and the sea covered them!
Who is like unto Thee, O Lord?
From everlasting to everlasting... Thou art God!
(All) The Lord is one!
The Lord is one!
Before you strike... show me his blood on your sword.
You couldn’ t even kill him.
His god... lS God.
’ And Moses led lsrael from the Red Sea ’ into the wilderness of Sinai. ’ And they camped before the holy mountain. ’ And when the people saw ’ that Moses delayed to come down out of the mountain, ’ they gathered together. ’
Could anyone live on that summit for 40 days and nights?
- Yes!
By the will of God!
- Who knows the will of God?
Do l?
Or you, Sephora?
His grieving wife.
She came back to find her husband.
But even she cannot hope he lives!
Moses went up into the forbidden ground to receive God’ s law!
But he’ s not returned!
We share your pain.
We sympathise.
But will sympathy lead us to this land flowing with milk and honey?
(Man) Now we have no leader!
Moses WlLL return... AAH!
Would a God who’ s shown you such wonders
let Moses die before his work is done?
His mother!
So beautiful is the hope of a mother!
But there are other mothers among you!
What will become of your children?
- We must have faith!
You, Aaron?
Can you lead us to this land of promise?
- Do you know where it is?
- Across the wilderness!
- Then who is to lead us?
- YOU, Dathan!
Where could I bring you but Egypt?
- Where there is death?
- No!
Where there is food!
- Pharaoh would kill us.
- Not with a god of Egypt before us!
- Make one, Aaron.
- Aaron knows the art of the temple!
(Others implore)
He will not!
He would rather see our flesh rot in the wilderness.
You WlLL make a god for us!
A god of gold!
A golden calf!
Korah shall be the high priest!
Bring baskets!
Buckets!
Shawls!
Anything you have!
Take off your earrings, your bracelets, your necklaces...
Aaron will make us a golden calf!
- The gold we took from Egypt!
- There!
From the burning bush, O Lord, you charged me to bring the people to this holy mountain, to behold your glory and receive your law.
What have I left undone?
’ l am... ’ l am... ’ l am the Lord thy God. ’ Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
’ Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.
’ And they overlaid the image with pure gold. ’ And Aaron fashioned it and smoothed it with the hammer, ’ ready to be graven by cunning art and man’ s device. ’ And he fastened it with nails that it should not move. ’ And he that smote the anvil ’ did beat the molten gold into thin plates. ’ For they had gathered their treasure into the midst of the furnace, ’ and did blow the fire upon it to melt it. ’ And they adorned themselves in rich apparel and costly array, ’ veils of blue, purple and scarlet, and fine linen wrought in Egypt. ’ And the women tread grapes into new wine. ’ ’ Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.
’ Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
’ Honour thy father and thy mother.
’ Thou shalt not kill. ’
(Cheering) ’ And the people sinned a great sin, ’ for they had made them a god of gold. ’ And they bore him upon their shoulders and rejoiced, ’ saying, ’’ This be our god, O lsrael. ’’’
Are you mourners of Moses afraid to face the new god? ’ Then they were as children who have lost their faith. ’ They were perverse and crooked and rebellious against God.
They did eat the bread of wickedness, ’ and drank the wine of violence, ’ and did evil in the eyes of the Lord. ’ And the people cried, ’’’ The graven image hath brought us joy, ’’ ’ and they worshipped the golden calf and sacrificed unto it. ’
Here is your sacrifice!
’ Thou shalt not commit adultery.
’ Thou shalt not steal.
’ Thou shalt not bear false witness ’ against thy neighbour.
’ Thou shalt not covet anything that is thy neighbour’ s. ’
(Moses) Written with the finger of God.
’ Go!
Get thee down, ’ for thy people have corrupted themselves. ’
’ And the people rose up to play and did eat and drink. ’ They were as the children of fools ’ and cast off their clothes. ’ The wicked were like a troubled sea ’ whose waters cast up mire and dirt. ’ They sank from evil to evil and were viler than the earth. ’ And there was rioting and drunkenness, ’ for they had become servants of sin. ’ There was manifest all manner of ungodliness and works of the flesh. ’ Even adultery and lasciviousness, ’ uncleanness, idolatry and rioting, ’ vanity and wrath. ’ And they were filled with iniquity and vile affections. ’ And Aaron knew that he had brought them to shame. ’
Abiram!
Korah!
Bind the sacrifice with cord!
Even unto the horns of the altar!
The light of God shines from you, Moses.
Do not kneel to me, Joshua.
These tablets of stone...
The writing of God.
His Ten Commandments.
There is a noise of war in the camp.
It is not the noise of war.
It is the noise of song and revelry.
Moses!
Joshua!
Woe unto thee, oh lsrael.
You have sinned a great sin in the sight of God!
You are not worthy to receive these Ten Commandments.
Aaron!
We are gathered against you, Moses!
You take too much upon yourself!
We will not live by your commandments.
We are free!
There is no freedom without the law.
Whose law?
Yours?
Did you carve the tablets to become a prince over us?
let him come to me!
(Confused shouts)
- You have cursed us.
- These people made me.
He showed you no milk and honey!
I show you a god of gold!
Come with me!
Follow me!
Blasphemers! ldolaters!
For this you shall drink bitter waters!
God has set before you this day his laws of life and good and death and evil.
Those who will not live by the law... (Shouts of panic) shall die by the law!
’ And the Lord’ s anger was kindled against lsrael. ’ And to prove whether they would keep his commandments or no, ’ he made them wander in the wilderness 40 years, ’ until the generation that had done evil in the sight of the Lord ’ was consumed. ’ But Moses ’ eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. ’ And he went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountains, ’ and the Lord showed him all the land ’ that was beyond the river Jordan. ’
The Lord was angry with me because I disobeyed him by the waters of strife.
And he said unto me, ’’ Behold the new land with thine eyes. ’’ Thou shalt not cross over this river Jordan. ’’
Then I shall stay.
I am called by the Lord, Sephora.
I go alone.
Look, Moses.
The people have come to the river Jordan.
ln the Ark they carry the law you brought them.
You taught them not to live by bread alone.
You are God’ s torch, that lights the way to freedom.
I love you.
Joshua, I charge you and strengthen you, for you shall go over Jordan to lead the people.
As for me and my house, we shall serve the Lord.
Mered, give me the books.
Eleazar... set these five books in the Ark of the Covenant, by the tablets of the Ten Commandments, which the Lord restored unto us.
Go.
Proclaim liberty throughout all the lands, unto all the inhabitants thereof.
Once upon a time in a kingdom far, far away, the king and queen were blessed with a beautiful baby girl.
And throughout the land, everyone was happy... until the sun went down and they saw that their daughter was cursed with a frightful enchantment that took hold each and every night.
Desperate, they sought the help of a fairy godmother who had them lock the young princess away in a tower, there to await the kiss... of the handsome Prince Charming.
It was he who would chance the perilous journey through blistering cold and scorching desert traveling for many days and nights, risking life and limb to reach the Dragon' s keep.
For he was the bravest, and most handsome... in all the land.
And it was destiny that his kiss would break the dreaded curse.
He alone would climb to the highest room of the tallest tower to enter the princess' s chambers, cross the room to her sleeping silhouette, pull back the gossamer curtains to find her...
What?
Fiona?
- No!
Oh, thank heavens.
Where is she?
- She' s on her honeymoon.
- Honeymoon?
With whom?
So she said what' s the problem, baby?
I don' t know
Well, maybe I' m in love
Think about it every time I think 'bout it
Can' t stop thinking 'bout it
How much longer will it take to cure this?
Just to cure it, 'cause I can' t ignore it
But I don' t know nothing 'bout love
- Turn a little faster
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
So I said I' m a snowball running
Running down into this spring that' s coming all this love
Shimmering love
To the strawberry ice cream
Well, I didn' t mean to do it
But there' s no escaping your love
These lines of lightning mean we' re never alone
Come on, come on
Jump a little higher
If you feel a little lighter
Hyah!
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally
I' m in love, I' m in love
Accidentally in love
I' m in love
It' s so good to be home!
Just you and me and...
- Two can be as bad as one...
- Donkey?
Shrek!
Fiona!
Aren' t you two a sight for sore eyes!
Give us a hug, Shrek, you old love machine.
And look at you, Mrs. Shrek.
How 'bout a side of sugar for the steed?
Donkey, what are you doing here?
Oh, you mean like... sorting the mail and watering the plants?
- Yeah, and feeding the fish!
- I don' t have any fish.
You do now.
I call that one Shrek and the other Fiona.
That Shrek is a rascally devil.
Look at the time.
I guess you' d better be going.
Don' t you want to tell me about your trip?
Or how about a game of Parcheesi?
Shouldn' t you be getting home to Dragon?
Oh, yeah, that.
I don' t know.
She' s been all moody and stuff lately.
I thought I' d move in with you.
You know we' re always happy to see you, Donkey.
But Fiona and I are married now.
We need a little time, you know, to be together.
Just with each other.
Alone.
Say no more.
You don' t have to worry about a thing.
I will always be here to make sure nobody bothers you.
- Donkey!
- Yes, roomie?
You' re bothering me.
All right, cool.
Me and Pinocchio was going to catch a tournament, anyway, so...
Maybe I' il see y' all Sunday for a barbecue or something.
He' il be fine.
Now, where were we?
I think I remember.
- Donkey!
Alone!
I' m going.
What do you want me to tell these other guys?
Enough, Reggie.
"Dearest Princess Fiona.
"for a royal ball in celebration of your marriage
"at which time the King
"will bestow his royal blessing... upon you and your..." uh...
"Prince Charming.
"Love, the King and Queen of Far, Far Away." aka Mom and Dad. "
Mom and Dad?
- Prince Charming?
- Royal ball?
Can I come?
- We' re not going.
- What?
I mean, don' t you think they might be a bit... shocked to see you like this?
Well, they might be a bit surprised.
But they' re my parents, Shrek.
They love me.
They' il love you, too.
Yeah, right.
Somehow I don' t think I' il be welcome at the country club.
Stop it.
They' re not like that.
How do you explain Sergeant Pompous and the Fancy Pants Club Band?
Oh, come on!
You could at least give them a chance.
To do what?
Sharpen their pitchforks?
No!
They just want to give you their blessing.
Oh, great.
lf you want to be a part of this family, yes!
Who says I want to be part of this family?
You did!
So that' s it.
You won' t come?
Trust me.
We are not going!
Come on!
We don' t want to hit traffic!
Don' t worry!
Hit it!
Rawhide!
Move 'em on!
Rawhide!
Move 'em on!
Rawhide!
Knock 'em out!
Meet their mamas!
- Are we there yet?
- No.
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet.
- OK, are we there yet?
- No.
- Are we there yet?
- No!
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.
- Really?
- No!
- Are we there yet?
- No!
- Are we there yet?
- We are not!
- Are we there yet?
- Are we there yet?
- That' s not funny.
That' s really immature.
- This is why nobody likes ogres.
- Your loss!
- I' m gonna just stop talking.
- Finally!
This is taking forever, Shrek.
There' s no in- flight movie or nothing!
The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey.
That' s where we' re going.
Far, far... away!
All right, all right, I get it.
I' m just so darn bored.
Well, find a way to entertain yourself.
For five minutes...
Could you not be yourself...... for five minutes!
Are we there yet?
- Yes!
- Oh, finally!
It' s going to be champagne wishes and caviar dreams from now on.
We' il be back to pick you up later!
We are definitely not in the swamp anymore.
Halt!
Hey, everyone, look.
Talk about, talk about movin '...
Hey, ladies!
Nice day for a parade, huh?
Swimming pools!
Announcing the long- awaited return of the beautiful Princess Fiona and her new husband.
Well, this is it.
- This is it.
- This is it.
This is it.
Uh... why don' t you guys go ahead?
I' il park the car.
So... you still think this was a good idea?
Look.
Mom and Dad look happy to see us.
- Who on earth are they?
- I think that' s our little girl.
That' s not little!
That' s a really big problem.
Wasn' t she supposed to kiss Prince Charming and break the spell?
Well, he' s no Prince Charming, but they do look...
Happy now?
We came.
We saw them.
Now let' s go before they light the torches.
- They' re my parents.
They locked you in a tower.
That was for my own...
Good!
Here' s our chance.
Let' s go back inside and pretend we' re not home.
Harold, we have to be...
Quick!
While they' re not looking we can make a run for it.
Shrek, stop it!
Everything' s gonna be...
A disaster!
- You can do this.
- I really...
Here!
Mom...
Dad...
I' d like you to meet my husband...
Shrek.
Well, um...
It' s easy to see where Fiona gets her good looks from.
- Excuse me.
That' s good.
I guess not.
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don' t tell me you don' t know who I am.
What' s happening, everybody?
Thanks for waiting.
- No!
No!
Down!
No, Dad!
It' s all right.
He' s with us.
- He helped rescue me from the dragon.
Waiter!
How 'bout a bowl for the steed?
Oh, boy.
- Um, Shrek?
- Yeah?
Oh, sorry!
Great soup, Mrs Q.
Mmm!
No, no.
Darling.
Oh!
So, Fiona, tell us about where you live.
Well...
Shrek owns his own land.
- Don' t you, honey?
- Oh, yes!
It' s in an enchanted forest abundant in squirrels and cute little duckies and...
What?
I know you ain' t talking about the swamp.
An ogre from a swamp.
How original.
I suppose that would be a fine place to raise the children.
It' s a bit early to be thinking about that, isn' t it?
- lndeed.
- Harold!
- What' s that supposed to mean?
- Dad.
It' s great, OK?
- For his type, yes.
- My type?
I got to go to the bathroom.
- Dinner is served!
- Never mind.
I can hold it.
Bon appetit!
Oh, Mexican food!
My favorite.
Let' s not sit here with our tummies rumbling.
Everybody dig in.
Don' t mind if I do, Lillian.
I suppose any grandchildren I could expect from you would be...
Ogres, yes!
Right, Harold?
Oh, no!
Of course, not!
That is, assuming you don' t eat your own young!
Dad!
No, we usually prefer the ones who' ve been locked away in a tower!
- Shrek, please!
- I only did that because I love her.
Aye, day care or dragon- guarded castle.
You wouldn' t understand.
You' re not her father!
It' s so nice to have the family together for dinner.
- Harold!
- Shrek!
- Fiona!
- Fiona!
- Mom!
- Harold...
Donkey!
Your fallen tears have called to me
So, here comes my sweet remedy
I know what every princess needs
For her to live life happily...
Oh, my dear.
Oh, look at you.
You' re all grown up.
- Who are you?
- Oh, sweet pea!
I' m your fairy godmother.
- I have a fairy godmother?
Now, don' t worry.
With just a...
Wave of my magic wand Your troubles will soon be gone
With a flick of the wrist and just a flash You' il land a prince with a ton of cash
A high- priced dress made by mice no less
Some crystal glass pumps And no more stress
Your worries will vanish, your soul will cleanse
Confide in your very own furniture friends
We' il help you set a new fashion trend
- I' il make you fancy, I' il make you great - The kind of girl a prince would date!
They' il write your name on the bathroom wall...
"For a happy ever after, give Fiona a call!"
A sporty carriage to ride in style, Sexy man boy chauffeur, Kyle
Banish your blemishes, tooth decay, Cellulite thighs will fade away
And oh, what the hey!
Have a bichon frisé! '
Nip and tuck, here and there to land that prince with the perfect hair
Lipstick liners, shadows blush To get that prince with the sexy tush
Lucky day, hunk buffet You and your prince take a roll in the hay
You can spoon on the moon With the prince to the tune
Don' t be drab, you' il be fab Your prince will have rock- hard abs
Cheese soufflé, Valentine' s Day Have some chicken fricassee!
Look...
Be that way.
- We didn' t like you, anyway.
- Fiona?
Fiona?
Oh!
You got a puppy?
All I got in my room was shampoo.
Oh, uh...
Fairy Godmother, furniture...
I' d like you to meet my husband, Shrek.
Your husband?
What?
When did this happen?
Shrek is the one who rescued me.
- But that can' t be right.
- Oh, great, more relatives!
She' s just trying to help.
She can help us pack.
We' re leaving.
- What?
- I don' t want to leave.
When did you decide this?
- Shortly after arriving.
- Look, I' m sorry...
No, that' s all right.
I need to go, anyway.
But remember, dear.
lf you should ever need me... happiness... is just a teardrop away.
Thanks, but we' ve got all the happiness we need.
Happy, happy, happy...
So I see.
Let' s go, Kyle.
- Very nice, Shrek.
- What?
You could' ve at least tried to get along with my father.
I don' t think I was going to get Daddy' s blessing, even if I did want it.
Do you think it might be nice if somebody asked me what I wanted?
Sure.
Do you want me to pack for you?
You' re unbelievable!
You' re behaving like a...
Say it!
- Like an ogre!
Here' s a news flash for you!
Whether your parents like it or not...
I am an ogre!
And guess what, Princess?
That' s not about to change.
Think about that.
That' s real smooth, Shrek.
"I' m an ogre!"
I knew this would happen.
You started it.
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
Not me.
I think, Harold, you' re taking this a little too personally.
This is Fiona' s choice.
But she was supposed to choose the prince we picked for her.
I mean, you expect me to give my blessings to this... thing?
Fiona does.
And she' il never forgive you if you don' t.
I don' t want to lose our daughter again, Harold.
Oh, you act as if love is totally predictable.
We used to walk down by the lily pond and...
- they were in bloom...
- Our first kiss.
It' s not the same!
I don' t think you realize that our daughter has married a monster!
Oh, stop being such a drama king.
Fine!
Pretend there' s nothing wrong!
La, di, da, di, da!
lsn' t it all wonderful!
I' d like to know how it could get any worse!
- Hello, Harold.
- What happened?
Just the old crusade wound playing up a bit!
I' il just stretch it out here for a while.
You better get in.
We need to talk.
Actually, Fairy Godmother, off to bed.
Already taken my pills, and they tend to make me a bit drowsy.
So, how about... we make this a quick visit.
What?
Ha- ha- ha!
So, what' s new?
You remember my son, Prince Charming?
ls that you?
My gosh!
It' s been years.
Oh, about five minutes ago, actually.
After I endured blistering winds, scorching desert...
I climbed to the highest room in the tallest tower...
Mommy can handle this.
He endures blistering winds and scorching desert!
And what does he find?
Some gender- confused wolf telling him that his princess is already married.
It wasn' t my fault.
He didn' t get there in time.
Stop the car!
Harold.
You force me to do something I really don' t want to do.
Where are we?
Welcome to Friar' s Fat Boy!
May I take your order?
My diet is ruined!
I hope you' re happy.
Er... okay.
Two Renaissance Wraps, no mayo... chili rings...
- I' il have the Medieval Meal.
- One Medieval Meal and, Harold...
- Curly fries?
- No, thank you.
- Sourdough soft taco, then?
- No, really, I' m fine.
Your order, Fairy Godmother.
This comes with the Medieval Meal.
There you are, dear.
We made a deal, Harold, and I assume you don' t want me to go back on my part.
lndeed not.
So, Fiona and Charming will be together.
- Yes.
- Believe me, Harold.
Not only for your daughter... but for your Kingdom.
What am I supposed to do about it?
Oh...
Come on in, Your Majesty.
With a little drop of poison
Excuse me.
Do I know you?
No, you must be mistaking me for someone else.
Uh... excuse me.
Ah!
Right.
You see, I need to have someone taken care of.
- Who' s the guy?
- Well, he' s not a guy, per se.
Um...
He' s an ogre.
Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.
There' s only one fellow who can handle a job like that, and, frankly... he don' t like to be disturbed. he don' t like to be disturbed.
Where could I find him?
Hello?
Sorry!
I hope I' m not interrupting, but I' m told you' re the one to talk to about an ogre problem?
You are told correct.
But for this, I charge a great deal of money.
Would... this be enough?
You have engaged my valuable services, Your Majesty.
Just tell me where I can find this ogre.
Everyone says I' m getting down too low
Everyone says you' ve just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
I need some sleep
Time to put the old horse down
And the wheels keep spinning round
Everyone says you' ve just gotta let it go
Dear Knight, I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
Dear Diary...
Sleeping Beauty is having a slumber party tomorrow, but Dad says I can' t go.
He never lets me out after sunset.
Dad says I' m going away for a while.
Must be like some finishing school.
Mom says that when I' m old enough, my Prince Charming will rescue me from my tower and bring me back to my family, and we' il all live happily ever after.
Mrs. Fiona Charming.
Mrs. Fiona Charming.
Mrs. Fiona Charming.
Mrs. Fiona Charming.
I hope I' m not interrupting anything.
No, no.
I was just reading a, uh... a scary book.
I was hoping you' d let me apologize for my despicable behavior earlier.
- Okay...
- I don' t know what came over me.
Do you suppose we could pretend it never happened and start over...
- Look, Your Majesty, I just...
- Please.
Call me Dad.
We both acted like ogres.
Maybe we just need some time to get to know each other.
Excellent idea!
I was actually hoping you might join me for a morning hunt.
I know it would mean the world to Fiona.
Shall we say, 7: 30 by the old oak?
Face it, Donkey!
We' re lost.
We followed the King' s instructions exactly.
"Head to the darkest part of the woods..."
"Past the sinister trees with scary- looking branches."
- The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!
- We passed that three times already!
You were the one who said not to stop for directions.
Oh, great.
My one chance to fix things up with Fiona' s dad and I end up lost in the woods with you!
Don' t get huffy!
I' m only trying to help.
I know.
- I' m sorry, all right?
- Hey, don' t worry about it.
I just really need to make things work with this guy.
Yeah, sure.
Now let' s go bond with Daddy.
Well, well, well, Donkey.
I know it was kind of a tender moment back there, but the purring?
What?
I ain' t purring.
Sure.
A hug?
Donkeys don' t purr.
What do you think I am, some kind of a...
Ha- ha!
Fear me, if you dare!
Look!
A little cat.
- Look out, Shrek!
He got a piece!
- It' s a cat, Donkey.
Come here, little kitty, kitty.
Oh!
- Whoa!
I' m coming!
- Come on!
Get it off!
No!
- Look out, Shrek!
- Get it off!
Hold still!
- Did I miss?
- No.
You got them.
Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from...
Puss... in Boots!
I' il kill that cat!
Ah- ha- ha!
Hairball.
That is nasty!
What should we do with him?
Take the sword and neuter him.
Oh, no!
Por favor!
I implore you!
It was nothing personal, Senor.
I was doing it only for my family.
My mother, she is sick.
And my father lives off the garbage!
The King offered me much in gold and I have a litter of brothers...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Fiona' s father paid you to do this?
The rich King?
Si.
Well, so much for Dad' s royal blessing.
Don' t feel bad.
Almost everybody that meets you wants to kill you.
Gee, thanks.
Maybe Fiona would' ve been better off if I were some sort of Prince Charming.
That' s what the King said.
Oh, uh... sorry.
I thought that question was directed at me.
Shrek, Fiona knows you' d do anything for her.
Well, it' s not like I wouldn' t change if I could.
I just wish I could make her happy.
"A tear drop away."
Donkey!
Think of the saddest thing that' s ever happened to you!
Aw, man, where do I begin?
First there was the time that old farmer tried to sell me for some magic beans.
Then this fool had a party and he have the guests trying to pin the tail on me.
Then they got drunk and start beating me with a stick, going "Pinata!!"
What is a pinata, anyway?
No, Donkey!
I need you to cry!
Don' t go projecting on me.
I know you' re feeling bad, but you got to...
Aaaahhh!
You little, hairy, litter- licking sack of...
Is it on?
Is it on?
This is Fairy Godmother.
I' m either away from my desk or with a client.
But if you come by the office, we' il be glad to make you an appointment.
Have a "happy ever after."
Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?
That' s more like it!
Shrek and Donkey, on another whirlwind adventure!
Ain' t no stoppin 'us now!
Whoo!
We' re on the move!
- Stop, Ogre!
On my honor, I am obliged to accompany you until I have saved your life as you have spared me mine.
The position of annoying talking animal has already been taken.
Let' s go, Shrek.
Shrek?
- Shrek!
- Aw, come on, Donkey.
Look at him... in his wee little boots.
You know, how many cats can wear boots?
Honestly.
- Let' s keep him!
- Say what?
Listen.
He' s purring!
- Oh, so now it' s cute.
- Come on, Donkey.
Lighten up?
Look who' s telling who to lighten up!
Look who' s telling who to lighten up!
Shrek!
Shrek?
They' re both festive, aren' t they?
What do you think, Harold?
Yes, yes.
Fine.
Try to at least pretend you' re interested in your daughter' s wedding ball.
Honestly, Lillian, I don' t think it matters.
How do we know there will even be a ball?
Mom.
Dad.
- Oh, hello, dear.
- What' s that, Cedric?
Coming.
Mom, have you seen Shrek?
I haven' t.
You should ask your father.
Be sure and use small words, dear.
He' s a little slow this morning.
- Can I help you, Your Majesty?
- Ah, yes!
Mmm!
What do you call this dish?
That would be the dog' s breakfast, Your Majesty.
Ah, yes.
Very good, then.
- Dad?
Dad, have you seen Shrek?
- No, I haven' t, dear.
I' m sure he just went off to look for a nice... mud hole to cool down in.
You know, after your little spat last night.
You heard that, huh?
The whole kingdom heard you.
I mean, after all, it is in his nature to be... well, a bit of a brute.
Him?
You know, you didn' t exactly roll out the Welcome Wagon.
Well, what did you expect?
Look at what he' s done to you.
Shrek loves me for who I am.
I would think you' d be happy for me.
Darling, I' m just thinking about what' s best for you.
Maybe you should do the same.
No, really?
Oh...
Oh, no.
That' s the old Keebler' s place.
Let' s back away slowly.
That' s the Fairy Godmother' s cottage.
She' s the largest producer of hexes and potions in the whole kingdom.
Then why don' t we pop in there for a spell?
Ha- ha!
Spell!
I' m here to see the...
The Fairy Godmother.
She is not in.
Jerome!
Coffee and a Monte Cristo.
Now!
Yes, Fairy Godmother.
Right away.
Look, she' s not seeing any clients today, OK?
That' s OK, buddy.
We' re from the union.
The union?
We represent the workers in all magical industries, both evil and benign.
Oh, right.
Are you feeling at all degraded or oppressed?
Uh... a little.
We don' t even have dental.
They don' t even have dental.
Okay, we' il just have a look around.
By the way.
I think it' d be better if the Fairy Godmother didn' t know we were here.
Huh?
- Stop it.
- Of course.
Go right in.
Naughty!
A pinch of passion.
lust!
Excuse me.
Sorry to barge in like this...
What in Grimm' s name are you doing here?
Oh- ho- ho!
And there' s some question as to why that is?
Well, let' s explore that, shall we?
Ah.
Princess.
Cinderella.
Here we are.
"Lived happily ever after." Oh...
No ogres!
Snow White.
A handsome prince.
Oh, no ogres.
Sleeping Beauty.
Oh, no ogres!
Hansel and Gretel?
No!
Thumbelina?
No.
The Golden Bird, the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman...
No, no, no, no, no!
You see, ogres don' t live happily ever after.
All right, look, lady!
Don' t you point... those dirty green sausages at me!
Your Monte Cristo and coffee.
Oh!
Sorry.
Ah... that' s okay.
We were just leaving.
Very sorry to have wasted your time, Miss Godmother.
Just... go.
Come on, guys.
TGlF, eh, buddy?
Working hard or hardly working, eh, Mac?
Get your fine Corinthian footwear and your cat cheeks out of my face!
Man, that stinks!
You don' t exactly smell like a basket of roses.
- Well, one of these has got to help.
- I was just concocting this very plan!
Already our minds are becoming one.
Whoa, whoa. lf we need an expert on licking ourselves, we' il give you a call.
Shrek, this is a bad idea.
Make yourself useful and go keep watch.
Puss, do you think you could get to those on top?
No problema, boss.
Ha- ha- ha- ha!
Shrek, are you off your nut?
Donkey, keep watch.
Keep watch?
Yeah, I' il keep watch.
- What do you see?
- Toad Stool Softener?
I' m sure a nice BM is the perfect solution for marital problems.
- Elfa Seltzer?
- Hex Lax?
Sorry.
How about "Happily Ever After"?
Well, what does it do?
It says "Beauty Divine."
ln some cultures, donkeys are revered as the wisest of creatures.
Especially us talking ones.
Donkey!
That' il have to do.
We' ve got company.
Hurry!
Nice catch, Donkey!
A good use for your mouth.
Come on!
Fallen in love with
Just get this place cleaned up!
And somebody bring me something deep fried and smothered in chocolate!
- Mother!
- Charming.
Sweetheart.
This isn' t a good time, pumpkin.
Mama' s working.
Whoa, what happened here?
- The ogre, that' s what!
- What?
Where is he, Mom?
I shall rend his head from his shoulders!
I will smite him where he stands!
He will rue the very day he stole my kingdom from me!
Oh, put it away, Junior!
You' re still going to be king.
We' il just have to come up with something smarter.
Pardon.
Everything is accounted for, Fairy Godmother, except for one potion.
What?
I do believe we can make this work to our advantage.
Maximum strength.
"For you and your true love.
"Happiness, comfort and beauty divine."
- You both will be fine?
- I guess it means it' il affect Fiona, too.
Hey, man, this don' t feel right.
My donkey senses are tingling all over.
Drop that jug o 'voodoo and let' s get out of here.
It says, "Beauty Divine."
How bad can it be?
See, you' re allergic to that stuff.
You' il have a reaction.
And if you think that I' il be smearing Vapor Rub over your chest, think again!
Boss, just in case there is something wrong with the potion... allow me to take the first sip.
It would be an honor to lay my life on the line for you.
Oh, no, no.
lf there' il be any animal testing, I' il do it.
Now give me that bottle.
How do you feel?
I don' t feel any different.
I look any different?
You still look like an ass to me.
Maybe it doesn' t work on donkeys.
- Well, here' s to us, Fiona.
- Shrek?
- You drink that, there' s no going back.
- I know.
- No more wallowing in the mud?
- I know.
- No more itchy butt crack?
- I know!
- But you love being an ogre!
- I know!
But I love Fiona more.
Shrek, no!
Got to be...
I think you grabbed the "Farty Ever After" potion.
Maybe it' s a dud.
Or maybe Fiona and I were never meant to be.
What did I tell you?
I feel something coming on.
I don' t want to die.
I don' t want to die!
Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy.
I' m melting!
I' m melting!
It' s just the rain, Donkey.
Oh.
Don' t worry.
The sun' il come out...
Tomorrow
Bet your bottom...
I' m coming, Elizabeth!
Donkey?
Are you all right?
- Hey, boss.
Let' s shave him.
- D- Donkey?
There you are!
We missed you at dinner.
What is it, darling?
I' ve been thinking about what you said.
Ah!
Excellent!
That' s my girl.
It was a mistake to bring Shrek here.
I' m going to go out and find him.
And then we' il go back to the swamp where we belong.
Fiona, please!
Fiona!
Look at him!
Quiet.
Look at him.
Good morning, sleepyhead.
Good morning!
Oh...
My head...
- Here, I fetched a pail of water.
Thanks.
Aahh!
A cute button nose?
Taut, round buttocks?
I' m...
- Gorgeous!
I' m Jill.
What' s your name?
- Um...
Shrek.
- Shrek?
Wow.
Are you from Europe?
- You' re tense.
- I want to rub his shoulders.
- I got it covered.
- I don' t have anything to rub.
Get in line.
- Have you seen my donkey?
- Who are you calling donkey?
- Donkey?
You' re a...
- A stallion, baby!
I can whinny.
I can count.
Look at me, Shrek!
I' m trotting!
That' s some quality potion.
What' s in that stuff?
Pah!
"Warning:
Side effects may include burning, itching, oozing, weeping.
"Not intended for heart patients or those with... nervous disorders."
What?
Senor?
"the drinker must obtain his true love' s kiss by midnight."
Midnight?
Why is it always midnight?
- Pick me!
I' il be your true love!
- I' il be your true love.
I' il be true... enough.
Oh...
And take it from me, Boss.
You are going to have one satisfied Princess.
And let' s face it.
You are a lot easier on the eyes.
lnside you' re the same old mean, salty...
- Easy. -... cantankerous, foul, angry ogre you always been.
And you' re still the same annoying donkey.
- Yeah.
Look out, Princess.
Here comes the new me.
First things first.
- We need to get you out of those clothes.
- Ready?
- Ready!
Oh, God!
My racing days are over!
I' m blind!
Tell the truth.
Will I ever play the violin again?
You poor creature!
ls there anything I can do for you?
Well, I guess there is one thing.
Take off the powdered wig and step away from your drawers.
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.
Father?
ls everything all right, Father?
Thank you, gentlemen!
Someday, I will repay you.
Oh, yeah
Ch- Ch- Changes
Don' t wanna be a richer one
Ch- Ch- Changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can' t trace time
Halt!
Tell Princess Fiona her husband, Sir Shrek, is here to see her.
Still don' t know what I was looking for
And my time was running wild, a million dead- end streets
Every time I thought I' d got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
- Ch- Ch- Ch- Ch- Changes
- Shrek?
Time may change me
Fiona?
Hello, handsome.
Shrek!
- Princess!
- Donkey?
That potion worked on you, too?
What potion?
Now, we' re sexy!
Shrek?
For you, baby...
I could be.
- Yeah, you wish.
- Donkey, where is Shrek?
He went inside looking for you.
Shrek?
Fiona!
Fiona!
You want to dance, pretty boy?
Are you going so soon?
Don' t you want to see your wife?
Fiona?
Shrek?
Aye, Fiona.
It is me.
What happened to your voice?
But not the way I feel about you.
Fiona?
- Charming?
- Do you think so?
Dad.
- Um...
Who are you?
- Mom, it' s me, Shrek.
I know you never get a second chance at a first impression, but, well, what do you think?
Fiona!
Fiona!
Fiona!
- Fiona!
- Fiona, Fiona!
I don' t think they can hear us, pigeon.
Don' t you think you' ve already messed her life up enough?
I just wanted her to be happy.
And now she can be.
Oh, sweetheart.
She' s finally found the prince of her dreams.
Look what I' ve done for her.
It' s time you stop living in a fairy tale, Shrek.
She' s a princess, and you' re an ogre.
That' s something no amount of potion will ever change.
I love her.
lf you really love her... you' il let her go.
Shrek?
Senor.
What' s going on?
Where are you going?
You wouldn' t have had anything to do with this, would you, Harold?
People just ain' t no good
I think that' s well understood
There you go, boys.
Just leave the bottle, Doris.
Why the long face?
It was all just a stupid mistake.
I never should have rescued her from that tower in the first place.
I hate Mondays.
I can' t believe you' d walk away from the best thing that happened to you.
What choice do I have?
She loves that pretty boy, Prince Charming.
Come on. ls he really that good- looking?
Are you kidding?
He' s gorgeous!
He has a face that looks like it was carved by angels.
- Oh.
He sounds dreamy.
- You know... shockingly, this isn' t making me feel any better.
Look, guys.
It' s for the best.
Mom and Dad approve, and Fiona gets the man she' s always dreamed of.
Everybody wins.
Except for you.
I don' t get it, Shrek.
Aye.
And that' s why I have to let her go.
Excuse me, is she here?
She' s, uh... in the back.
Oh, hello again.
Fairy Godmother.
Charming.
You' d better have a good reason for dragging us down here, Harold.
Well, I' m afraid Fiona isn' t really... warming up to Prince Charming.
- FYl, not my fault.
- No, of course it' s not, dear.
I mean, how charming can I be when I have to pretend I' m that dreadful ogre?
No, no, it' s nobody' s fault.
Perhaps it' s best if we just call the whole thing off, okay?
- What?
- You can' t force someone to fall in love!
I beg to differ.
I do it all the time!
Have Fiona drink this and she' il fall in love with the first man she kisses, which will be Charming.
- Umm... no.
- What did you say?
I can' t.
I won' t do it.
lf you remember, I helped you with your happily ever after.
And I can take it away just as easily.
ls that what you want? ls it?
- No.
- Good boy.
Now, we have to go.
I need to do Charming' s hair before the ball.
He can never get to the back.
Oh.
Thank you, Mother.
Mother?
A talking horse!
The ogre!
Stop them!
Stop them!
The abs are fab and it' s gluteus to the maximus here at tonight' s Far, Far Away Royal Ball blowout!
like Miss Muffet' s curds and whey.
And, oh my, the outfits look gorgeous!
Look!
Hansel and Gretel!
What the heck are the crumbs for?
And right behind them, Tom Thumb and Thumbelina!
Who' s this?
Who' s this?
Who is this?
Oh.
It' s the one, it' s the only...
It' s the Fairy Godmother!
Hello, Far, Far Away!
May all your endings be happy and...
Well, you know the rest!
We' il be right back with the Royal Far, Far Away Ball after these messages.
They bore me to tears.
Flip over to Wheel Of Torture!
I' m not flipping anywhere, sir, until I see Shrek and Fiona.
Whizzes on you guys.
Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing!
No, to your left.
Your left!
- Tonight on "Knights"...
- Now here' s a good show!
We got a white bronco heading east into the forest.
Requesting backup.
It' s time to teach these madcap mammals their "devil may mare" attitudes just won' t fly.
Why you grabbing me?
Police brutality!
- Ow!
Ow!
You capitalist pig dogs!
- That' s not mine.
Find Princess Fiona!
I' m a donkey!
Tell her Shrek...
I' m her husband, Shrek!
Quick!
Rewind it!
I' m her husband, Shrek!
Darling?
I thought I might find you here.
How about a nice hot cup of tea before the ball?
I' m not going.
The whole Kingdom' s turned out to celebrate your marriage.
There' s just one problem.
That' s not my husband.
I mean, look at him.
Yes, he is a bit different, but people change for the ones they love.
You' d be surprised how much I changed for your mother.
Change?
He' s completely lost his mind!
Why not come down to the ball and give him another chance?
You might find you like this new Shrek.
That' s mine.
Otherwise I' m up all night.
I got to get out of here!
You can' t lock us up like this!
Let me go!
What about my Miranda rights?
You' re supposed to say I have the right to remain silent.
Nobody said I have the right to remain silent!
You have the right to remain silent.
What you lack is the capacity.
I must hold on before I, too, go totally mad.
Shrek?
Donkey?
Too late.
Gingy!
Pinocchio!
Oh...
Fire in ze hole!
Quick!
Tell a lie!
- What should I say?
- Anything, but quick!
I am wearing ladies' underwear.
- I most certainly am not!
- I am not!
- What kind?
- It' s a thong!
- Are too!
- Are not!
- Are too!
Ow!
Hey, hey, hey!
Ow!
- What?
Puss!
- Sorry, boss.
- Quit messing around!
We' ve got to stop that kiss!
I thought you was going to let her go.
I was, but I can' t let them do this to Fiona.
That' s what I like to hear.
Look who' s coming around!
It' s impossible!
The castle' s guarded.
- What?
- Do you still know the Muffin Man?
Well, sure!
He' s down on Drury Lane.
Why?
Because we' re gonna need flour.
Lots and lots of flour.
Gingy!
Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man!
It' s alive!
Run, run, run, as fast you can!
Go, baby, go!
There it is, Mongo!
No, you great stupid pastry!
Come on!
Mongo!
Down here!
Look at the pony!
That' s right!
Follow the pretty pony!
Pretty pony wants to play at the castle!
Ladies and gentlemen.
Presenting Princess Fiona and her new husband, Prince Shrek.
Shrek, what are you doing?
I' m just playing the part, Fiona.
ls that glitter on your lips?
Cherry flavored.
Want to taste?
What is with you?
- But, Muffin Cake...
C Minor, put it in C Minor.
I' d like to dedicate this song to...
Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.
Will you honor me with a dance?
Where have all the good men gone
And where are all the gods?
To fight the rising odds?
Since when do you dance?
Fiona, my dearest, if there' s one thing I know, it' s that love is full of surprises.
And I dream of what I need
Hit it!
I need a hero
All right, big fella!
Aim!
- Brace yourselves!
- Ooh!
Not the gumdrop button!
Ha- ha!
All right!
Somewhere after midnight In my wildest fantasy
Go, Mongo!
Go!
Man the cauldrons!
After you, Mongo.
- That' s it!
Heave- ho!
- Watch out!
Shrek!
Up where the mountains Meet the heavens above
Out where the lightning Splits the sea
I could swear there is someone Somewhere watching me
Heave!
No...!
- Be good.
Let me go!
Donkey!
Go!
Go!
Your lady needs you!
Go!
Aww...
On guard!
He' s gotta be strong And he' s gotta be fast
And he' s gotta be fresh From the fight
- I need a hero - Stop!
- Hey, you!
Back away from my wife.
- Shrek?
You couldn' t just go back to your swamp and leave well enough alone.
- Now!
- Pigs und blanket!
Pinocchio!
Whah!
Ah!
Donkey!
I' m a real boy.
- Ah.
That' s mine!
And Donkey!
She' s taken the potion!
Kiss her now!
- Hi- ya!
- Fiona.
- Shrek.
Harold!
You were supposed to give her the potion!
Well, I guess I gave her the wrong tea.
- Mommy!
- Mommy?
Ha!
Oh, Dad!
- ls he...?
He croaked.
Harold?
Dad?
I' d hoped you' d never see me like this.
- And he gave you a hard time!
- Donkey!
No, no, he' s right.
To both of you.
I only wanted what was best for Fiona.
But I can see now... she already has it.
Shrek, Fiona...
Will you accept an old frog' s apologies... and my blessing?
Harold?
I' m sorry, Lillian.
I just wish I could be the man you deserve.
You' re more that man today than you ever were... warts and all.
Boss!
The Happily Ever After Potion!
Midnight!
Fiona. ls this what you want?
- What?
- Because if you kiss me now... we can stay like this.
You' d do that?
- For me?
- Yes.
To live happily ever after...
with the ogre I married.
Whatever happens, I must not cry!
You cannot make me cry!
Aaah!
Oh, no.
Hey.
You still look like a noble steed to me.
Oh.
I remember.
Hey! lsn' t we supposed to be having a fiesta?
Uno, dos, quatro, hit it!
Puss and Donkey, y' all...
Black cats and voodoo dolls
- I feel a premonition
Here we go!
Hey gorgeous!
KRALER:
Mr. Frank.
Mr. Frank?
Kraler.
Mr. Kraler.
Miep.
My good friends.
It is so good to see you home.
We had heard nothing.
I' m alone.
You must come home with us...... and rest now.
- You must stay with us.
FRANK:
No, I can' t stay in Amsterdam.
Mr. Frank, this is your home.
- Amsterdam is your home.
- It has too many memories.
Everywhere there' s something, Miep.
Everywhere.
Even seeing you and Mr. Kraler....
I shouldn' t talk to you like this, after all you did.
Why, we' d do it again.
Everything' s gone.
The book....
They took everything, except some papers.
We saved your letters and papers.
Please burn them.
Burn everything.
I told her...... if I got back here, I' d find her book.
Anne' s diary?
It' s where she left it.
"The 9th of July, 1 942." 1 942.
Is it possible, Miep?
Only three years ago?
"Dear Diary, since you and I are to be great friends...... I will start by telling you all about myself.
My name is Anne Frank.
I am 1 3 years old.
I was born in Germany, but since my family is Jewish...... we emigrated to Holland when Hitler came to power.
Things went well for us until the war came and the German occupation.
Then things got very bad for the Jews. "
You could not do this and you could not do that.
We had to wear yellow stars.
I had to turn in my bike.
I couldn 't go to a Dutch school anymore.
I couldn 't go to the movies or ride in an automobile...... or even on a streetcar.
And a million other things.
But somehow, we children still managed to have fun.
This morning, Father woke me at 5: 00...... and told me to hurry and get dressed.
We were going into hiding.
I was to put on as many clothes as I could.
It would look too suspicious if we walked along carrying suitcases.
We were going to disappear...... vanish into thin air.
I' m living a great adventure.
Three other people were coming in with us.
Father knew them.
We had never met them.
- Something' s happened.
They had a 3 mile walk.
PETER:
- They' ve been arrested, I know.
Will you stop that?
- Mother.
Father.
We' re here.
You see?
- Mr. Van Daan.
Hello.
- Mrs. Van Daan.
- Mr. Frank.
Peter.
There were too many Green Police on the streets.
We took the long way around.
Did you introduce yourself?
My daughter Anne.
My wife, Edith.
Margot.
Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan.
Oh, and this is our son, Peter.
So, now, please let us take off some of these clothes.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Kraler.
Morning, Mr. Kraler.
- Mr. Frank.
You' re all here.
That is good.
- We hoped to have everything in order.
- Please, don' t even think of it.
We' il have leisure to arrange everything ourselves.
- Brought sandwiches for lunch.
- Thank you, Miep.
The canned goods are here, and your beans and potatoes.
- I' il get you ration books this afternoon.
- Ration books?
If they see our names on ration books, they' il know we' re here.
Don' t worry.
It won' t be your names that' il be on them.
ANNE:
The Westertoren!
- Anne!
No!
You must never touch a curtain.
Never.
No one must ever touch a curtain, day or night.
If someone on the streets should look up or someone should see...... we would be lost.
Remember, it' s not only our lives at stake...... but Miep' s and Mr. Kraler' s.
FRANK:
Thank you.
Miep or I will be up each day to bring you food and news.
Come, Miep, we must go.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye, Mr. Kraler.
How can we thank you?
I never thought I' d live to see the day when a man like Mr. Frank...... would have to go into hiding.
When you think of it....
Goodbye.
PETRONELLA:
Thank you, Mr. Kraler.
Goodbye.
EDlTH:
Anne!
- It' s all right, I have on three more.
PETRONELLA:
Excuse me, Mr. Frank.
- What do they mean, "1 3 minutes"?
- Before workmen come.
Now...... while the men are in the building below, we must be quiet.
Every sound can be heard down there, in the offices and in the workrooms too.
The men come at about 8: 30.
They leave at about 5: 30.
So to be perfectly safe, from 8 a. m. until 6 p. m...... we must move about up here only when absolutely necessary...... and then in stockinged feet.
We must not speak above a whisper or run any water.
We cannot use the sink or even, forgive me, the W. C.
No trash must ever be --
[SlREN APPROACHlNG]
No trash, which might reveal someone' s living here.
Not even a potato peeling.
We must burn everything in the stove at night.
This is the way that we must live until it is over, if we are to survive.
Until it is over.
After 6: 00, we can move about.
We can talk and laugh...... have our supper, read, play games, just as we would at home.
Now it would be wise if we all went to our rooms...... and were settled before 8: 00.
Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan, you' re upstairs.
I regret there' s no place up there for Peter.
But he' il be here, near us.
- And where am l?
- You and Margot will be in there.
Excuse me, Mr. Frank.
FRANK:
Yes?
Where do you sleep?
This room is our bedroom.
Oh, no, no.
You take the upstairs.
We' il sleep down here.
I' ve thought this out.
It' s the best arrangement.
The only arrangement.
Edith?
You must have some rest, dear.
You didn' t close your eyes last night.
Now, go in the girls' room.
- Well, how about Anne?
- I feel fine.
I' m going to help Father.
This way, Mrs. Van Daan.
Excuse me.
Up here.
PETER:
Mr. Frank?
- Mr. Frank?
Peter?
ANNE:
You' ve a cat?
Go ahead, but be quick.
- You only have about five minutes.
- He couldn' t live without that cat.
I didn' t know you had a cat.
I love cats.
What' s its name?
- Mouschi.
- What is it?
Mouschi.
A him or her?
- It' s a tom.
It doesn' t like strangers.
- Then I' il have to stop being a stranger.
PETER:
No.
You ought to have him fixed, to keep him from fighting.
What a nice cat.
Where do you go to school?
ANNE:
That' s where Margot and I go.
- Yeah, I know.
- I' ve never seen you around.
- I used to see you sometimes.
- You did?
Why didn' t you ever come over?
Oh, I don' t know.
I' m sort of a lone wolf.
You can' t be a lone wolf here.
I wonder what our friends will say when we don' t show up today.
I had a date with Sanne.
Do you know Sanne de Vries?
- No.
Sanne' s my best friend.
She' s thin like me.
They always yell at us:
"Anne and Sanne, the skinny bananas."
You took off your star.
That' s right.
You can' t do that.
They' il arrest you if you go out without your star.
Who' s going out?
- Help me.
- I' m helping.
- What are you going to do with it?
- Burn it.
It' s funny, I don' t think I could burn mine.
- I don' t know why.
You couldn' t?
Something they make you wear so they can kick you around.
I know.
But after all...... it is the Star of David, isn' t it?
Annele, it' s almost 8: 00.
Don' t you wanna sit with us?
It' il be a long day.
No, thanks.
This is fine.
You won' t forget to take off your shoes, will you?
Peter...... it' s nice to have you with us.
Yes, Mr. Frank.
See you later.
[CHURCH BELLS RlNGlNG]
ANNE:
It' s comforting that Mr. Kraler and his secretary...... are down there below us, in the office.
Our protectors, we call them.
I asked Father what would happen to them...... if anyone found out they were hiding us.
Father said they would suffer the same fate that we would.
We are over an old spice factory.
You can smell the spices all through the building.
I read A Tale of Two Cities through in that first day.
"It is a far, far better thing I do...... than I have ever done.
It is a far, far better rest that I go to...... than I have ever known.
The end. "
It was the saddest book I ever read.
It is us, Miep and Kraler.
Good evening, Mr. Kraler.
Good evening, Miep.
Good evening, Annele.
- Oh, Mr. Frank.
- Yes?
- This is the box you asked for.
- Thanks.
Oh, my dear friends, you were all so quiet up here.
- I thought you' d gone out for a walk.
Can you imagine me?
I didn' t talk.
I hardly moved for one whole day.
Wish they could hear that at school.
Mouschi!
Mouschi!
Peter!
Peter.
Mouschi.
- Annele!
Annie!
- Annele!
- Peter, I' m warning you.
Please, quiet.
Margot.
Margot!
- What are these?
- You don' t have to whisper now.
- There you are.
- He' s such a nice cat.
MARGOT:
You' re welcome.
Annele.
There' s a box there.
Will you open it, please?
Know how I' m going to think of it here?
As a boarding house, a very peculiar boarding house.
Father, my film stars!
I was wondering where they were.
And Queen Wilhelmina.
How wonderful.
There' s something more.
Go on, look further.
A diary.
I' ve never had a diary.
And I' ve always wanted one.
A pencil?
I' m going downstairs to get a pencil.
- Anne, no!
- There' s nobody down there.
Doesn' t matter.
Don' t go beyond that door.
- Never?
- Never.
I' m sorry, Anne, it isn' t safe.
FRANK:
It' il be hard, I know that.
But always remember there are no walls, no locks...... no bolts that anyone can put on your mind.
As a matter of fact, just between us, Annele...... being here has certain advantages.
For instance...... remember that battle with your mother about overshoes?
You said you' d rather die than wear overshoes.
Remember?
What happened?
In the end, you had to wear them.
Now, for as long as we are here, you won' t have to wear overshoes.
Isn' t that good?
And the piano.
You won' t have to practice it.
I tell you...... this is going to be a fine life for you.
It' s an odd idea for someone like me to keep a diary.
Not only because I have never done so before...... but because it seems to me, neither I, nor for that matter anyone else...... will be interested in the unbosomings of a 13- year- old schoolgirl.
Still, what does that matter?
I want to write, but more than that...... I want to bring out all kinds of things...... that lie buried deep in my heart.
First of all, I expect I should be describing...... what it' s like to go into hiding.
But I don 't really know yet myself.
I only know it' s funny never to be able to go outdoors.
Never to breathe fresh air.
Never to run and shout and jump.
Wednesday, the 23rd of September, 1942.
The news of the war is good.
Stalingrad is still holding out.
The Russian offensive continues in the Moscow area.
- It' s safe now.
- Whee!
- Anne!
- l 'm first for the W. C.
- Six o' clock, Margot.
School is over.
- Where are my shoes?
- Have you seen my shoes?
- What shoes?
- You' re gonna be sorry.
- I am?
- Annie, dear.
- Wait till I get you.
I' m waiting.
Stop!
Peter!
- Annie!
Peter!
Peter, where are you going?
- Gonna give Mouschi his dinner.
- Peter!
Annie, dear...... you shouldn' t play like that with Pete.
That' s not dignified.
I don' t wanna be dignified!
You complain I don' t treat you like a grownup, but when I do, you resent it.
I only want some fun.
I don' t know what' s the matter with that boy.
Give him a little time.
He isn' t used to girls.
Time?
Isn' t two months time?
I could cry.
She' s usually so prompt.
[SlREN APPROACHlNG]
- Margot, come and dance with me.
- I' ve got more work to do, Anne.
You know, we' re going to forget how to dance.
When we get out, we won' t remember a thing.
- Where is Peter?
Where would he be?
With his cat.
He hasn' t finished his lessons, has he?
Peter.
- Peter!
- What is it?
Your mother says to come out.
I' m giving Mouschi his dinner.
You know what your father says about wasting time with that cat.
- I haven' t looked at him since lunch.
- I' m only telling you.
I' il feed him.
- You stay out of here.
And I mean out.
Is that any way for you to talk to your little girlfriend?
Mother, I asked you...
-... would you please not say that?
- Look, he' s blushing.
- He' s blushing.
- Please, I' m not, but --
- Leave me alone.
- Like it' s something to be ashamed of.
Nothing to be ashamed of to have a girlfriend.
That' s crazy.
She' s only 1 3.
So what?
You' re 1 6.
It' s just perfect.
Your father' s 1 0 years older than me.
Mr. Frank, I warn you...... if this war lasts much longer, we' re gonna be related.
- Mazel tov.
- I haven' t seen my cat since lunch.
I' m giving Mouschi his dinner.
My little Mouschi.
I couldn' t live without my precious Mouschi.
You wonderful cat, you.
All right, Miss Quack- Quack.
- What' s that?
- Miss Quack- Quack!
- You!
You talk so much they call you Miss Quack- Quack.
You' re the most intolerable boy I ever met!
Quack, quack, quack!
- Ooh!
Anne, dear, you' re hot.
- You' re warm.
Are you all right?
- Mother, please.
- You don' t have a fever, do you?
- No.
You know we can' t call a doctor here, ever.
There' s only one thing to do, watch carefully.
Prevent an illness before it comes.
Let me see your tongue.
- Mother, this is perfectly absurd.
- Anne, dear, don' t be such a baby.
Let me see your tongue.
Otto.
Anne, you hear your mother, don' t you?
Come on, open up.
Quack.
Annie.
- Otto.
- Anne.
You' re all right.
I think there' s nothing the matter with our Anne that a ride on her bike...... or a visit with her friend Sanne de Vries wouldn' t cure.
Isn' t that so, Anne?
I keep wishing that Peter was a girl instead of a boy.
Then I' d have someone to talk to.
With all the boys in the world...... why did I have to get locked up with him?
Is it someone?
- ls it Miep?
It' s strange we don' t hear.
Maybe she got hurt.
- She' il come.
I wish she' d get here.
I' m going crazy without cigarettes.
Anne, you got "excellent" in your history paper...
-... and "very good" in Latin.
- Yes, but how about algebra?
Well, I have a confession to make.
Up until now, I managed to stay ahead of you in algebra.
Today, you caught up with me.
We' il leave it to Margot to correct.
- lsn' t algebra vile, Father?
- Vile.
- How did I do?
- Excellent, of course.
Anne, please.
Your French composition today, Margot, was just wonderful.
- Mrs. Van Daan, may I try it on?
- No, Annie.
It' s all right, really.
But please be careful with it.
My father gave me this coat the year before he died.
He always bought me the best money could buy.
Mrs. Van Daan, did you have a lot of boyfriends before you were married?
Annie, that' s a personal question.
It' s not courteous to ask personal questions.
I don' t mind.
Anneke, our house was always swarming with boys.
- When I was a young girl -- - Oh, no, not again.
Shut up!
One summer, we had a big house in Hilversum.
The boys....
The boys would come buzzing around like bees around a jam pot.
When I was 1 7....
Well, we were wearing short skirts then, and I had such good- looking legs.
I still have.
I may not be as pretty as I used to be...... but I still have my legs.
How about it, Mr. Frank?
All right, all right.
We see them.
I' m not asking you, I' m asking Mr. Frank.
- Mother, for heaven sakes.
- Oh, I embarrass you too, do l?
Let me tell you something.
I only hope the girl you marry has as good.
Anneke, my father used to worry with all the boys hanging around.
And he used to say to me:
"lf any of those boys get fresh, you just say to him:
'Remember, Mr. So- and- So, remember, I am a lady.' "
Look at you, talking that way with her.
Don' t you know she puts it in her diary?
PETRONELLA:
I' m only telling the truth.
Haven' t you finished?
- No.
VAN DAAN:
Leave him alone.
- I' m a dunce.
A hopeless case.
PETRONELLA:
It' s just you haven' t got anyone to help you...... Iike Father helps Anne and me.
But if l -- Well, if we could help....
What about it, Peter?
Would you like to study with us?
Shall we make our school coeducational?
Thanks, yes.
- Mr. Frank.
FRANK:
Yes?
You are an angel, an absolute angel.
Why didn' t I meet you before I met that one there?
I think it might be better if you went into your room, Peter, to work.
Excuse me.
Peter, you listen to Mr. Frank.
Mr. Frank is a highly educated man.
It' s after 8: 00.
Where are they?
- At least one of them should' ve come.
- They' il come.
Don' t worry.
Don' t tell me.
I know something' s wrong.
Isn' t it bad enough here without you sprawling all over?
If you didn' t smoke, you wouldn' t be so irritable.
- Am I smoking?
- You already smoked all the cigarettes.
- Miep only brought me one package.
- It' s a filthy habit...
VAN DAAN:
Please.
You' re smoking up all our money.
Will you shut up?!
And what are you staring at?
I never heard grownups quarrel like that before.
I thought only children quarreled.
This isn' t a quarrel, it' s a discussion.
I never heard children so rude before.
- I, rude?
- Yes!
- Annie, drink your milk.
- You' ve been spoiled.
What you need is a good spanking.
Remember, Mr. So- and- So, I am a lady.
You' re the most aggravating -- Why aren' t you nice and quiet...... Iike your sister, Margot?
Why do you show off all the time?
Let me give you a little advice.
Do you know that?
A man likes a girl who' il listen to him.
A girl who cooks and sews and cleans.
I' d cut my throat first.
I' d open my veins.
I am going to be remarkable.
I' m going to Paris...
-... to study music and art.
- Yeah, yeah.
I' m going to be an actress or a writer or a dancer.
ANNE:
I' m sorry.
You clumsy little fool!
- My father gave me this coat!
- I' m so sorry.
All ruined, and what do you care?
You ruined it!
I could kill you!
I could just kill you!
Petronella.
Petronella, it' s only a coat.
Only a coat.
Anne, you must not behave in that way.
It was an accident.
Anyone can have an accident.
I don' t mean that.
I mean the answering back.
You must not answer back.
They' re our guests.
You don' t hear Margot getting into arguments with them.
Try to be like Margot.
And have them walk all over me the way they do her?
No, thanks.
I don' t know what happens to you, Annie.
If I had ever talked to my mother as you talk to me....
Things have changed, Mother.
People aren' t like that anymore.
"Yes, Mother.
No, Mother.
Anything you say, Mother. "
I' ve got to fight things out for myself.
Make something of myself.
It isn' t necessary to fight to do it.
Margot doesn' t --
"Margot." That' s all I hear.
"Why aren' t you like Margot?"
Everything she does is right, and everything I do is wrong.
You' re all against me, and you worst of all.
I don' t know how we can go on living this way.
I can' t say a word to Annie, she flies at me.
You know Anne.
In a half an hour, she' il be laughing and joking.
And them.
I told your father it wouldn' t work with two families.
But no, no, he had to ask them.
Every time I hear that sound, my heart stops.
It' s Miep.
Father.
Yes?
It' s Miep.
EDlTH:
Thank you.
Is it Miep?
- Yes.
- At last, I' il have some cigarettes.
- Miep' s here.
I can' t tell you how sorry I am about the coat.
Don' t worry.
- Hello.
- Miep.
Mr. Kraler.
When Mr. Kraler comes, the sun begins to shine.
- Dirk has had to leave.
- Dirk is Miep' s fiancé.
He had to go into hiding in the country to escape a labor call- up...... but he has let me have the radio for you.
- He shouldn' t have.
- It was too dangerous.
Look!
Our blessed radio.
It gives us our eyes and ears out into the world.
We listen to the German station only for good music.
The Axis forces in the Western....
MAN ON RADlO: -- ceaseless attacks by land and air forces are now in full retreat.
The 8th army continues to advance.
It' s good.
All right, Peter.
Now, let' s see what they have to say about the Nazis, huh?
Berlin.
Must we listen?
All right, Peter, that' s enough.
The Green Police, they' ve found us.
This way, Mr. Dussel.
It' s Kraler.
And Miep.
Please open.
Bless them.
They' re here.
Kraler?
KRALER:
Open, please.
- Well, we had a visitor last night.
- We had a visitor last night.
- Y es, yes.
- A thief.
- It was a thief?
- Did you hear him?
- Yes.
- He was right under you.
In the office right under here.
We did not know.
We thought it was the police.
- Are you sure, Miep?
- You were, of course, quiet?
We didn' t move.
We hardly breathed all night.
- That is good.
It was close.
- Too close.
He went through everything, the desk and the files.
And he found the safe, but he could not get it open.
He' s looking for our ration card supply from the underground.
- Somebody knows.
- They are in that safe.
They' il come back.
You should get rid of that safe.
Get it out of here.
"Burglars do not come back.
The safe is gone. "
- Jokes, yeah.
- Mr. Frank, I must talk to you.
- Of course.
- Maybe we should get rid of the radio.
Burn it.
If the Green Police found that radio....
Then they' d find her diary.
We' il burn that too.
Not my diary.
My diary goes, I go with it.
- Where is it?
- Mr. Van Daan.
If they find us, they might as well find the diary, the radio....
- Usually, I try to bring good news.
- Yes, I know.
But something has happened.
A man came to me.
He told me that he has a Jewish friend, a dentist.
He begged me, could I find him a hiding place?
So I have come to you.
It is a terrible thing to ask of you, living the way you are...
-... but could you take him in?
- Well, of course we will.
- His name is Jan Dussel.
- Dussel.
I think I know him.
I think it' s fine to have him.
- Thank you.
But, Otto, where are we going to put him?
Where?
- There' s so little food as it is -- - We can stretch the food a little.
He can have my bed.
- No, thank you.
Margot will move in with us, and he can have her bed.
I' il get my things out.
Mr. Dussel.
Don' t bump your head.
Come in, Mr. Dussel.
This is Mr. Frank.
- Mr. Otto Frank?
- Yes.
Let me have your things, please.
Thank you, Mr. Frank.
I leave you in good hands.
Mr. Dussel, I must return your coat.
- What can I say to thank you?
- Mr. Kraler and Miep...... they' re our lifeline.
Without them, we couldn' t live.
KRALER:
You make us seem very heroic.
It isn' t that at all.
- We simply don' t like the Nazis.
"Nobody' s going to tell us Dutchmen what to do with our damn Jews."
We' il be up tomorrow, see if they' re treating you right.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Mr. Kraler.
Goodbye, Mr. Dussel.
DUSSEL:
Goodbye, Miep.
- Welcome, Mr. Dussel.
- Thank you.
This is my wife, Edith.
Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan.
Their son, Peter.
My daughters, Margot and Anne.
Hello, Anne.
- How do you do?
- Margot.
- How do you do?
Please, Mr. Dussel, sit down.
Thank you.
I' m dreaming, I know it.
Mr. Otto Frank here.
You' re not in Switzerland, then?
Someone said that you had escaped.
- And you' ve been here all this time?
- Ever since July.
Did Mr. Kraler warn you you won' t get much to eat here?
You can imagine.
Three ration cards among the seven of us.
Now you make eight.
DUSSEL:
Mr. Van Daan, you don' t realize what' s happening outside...... that you should warn me of a thing like that.
You don' t realize what' s going on, right here in Amsterdam.
Every day, hundreds of Jews disappear.
They surround the block.
They search house by house.
Every day, children come home from school to find their parents gone.
Hundreds are being deported.
People that you and I know: the Hallensteins, the Wessels.
Oh, no.
You get your call- up notice:
"Come to the station on such and such a day and hour.
Bring only what you can carry. "
If you don' t, they come drag you from your home...... and ship you off to Mauthausen, the death camp.
We didn' t know that things had got so much worse.
Forgive me for speaking so.
Do you know the de Vries?
They' re gone.
Sanne and I are in the same class.
Sanne is my best -- My best friend.
She returned home from school to find her parents gone.
She was alone for two days, and then they came and took her away.
Gone?
Yes, with all the others.
Oh, no.
People named Meyerberg, they lived near us.
- Do you know --?
- We should put this off.
I' m sure Mr. Dussel would like to get settled.
Would you take Mr. Dussel to his room now?
If you' il come with me, Mr. Dussel.
Forgive me if I haven' t expressed my gratitude.
This has been such a shock to me.
I always thought of myself as Dutch.
I was born in Holland.
My father was born in Holland, and my grandfather.
And now, after all these years....
If you will excuse me.
It' s so different from what Mr. Kraler tells us.
Mr. Kraler says that things are improving.
I like it better the way Kraler tells it.
Good night.
- Say good night!
- Good night, Mother.
Good night, Mr. Frank.
Good night.
Do you have any children, Mr. Dussel?
No, I never married.
- Have you no family at all?
No one.
How dreadful.
You must be terribly lonely.
I' m used to it.
I don' t think I could ever get used to it.
Didn' t you even have a pet?
- A cat or a dog?
- No.
No, no, I have an allergy to furbearing animals.
- Gives me asthma.
- Oh, dear.
What?
Peter has a cat.
- He has?
He has it here?
- Yes.
We hardly ever see it.
- He keeps it in his room all the time.
- Yeah.
- I' m sure it' il be all right.
- Well, I hope so.
Yes.
I hope I won' t be too much of a bother to you, Mr. Dussel.
No.
I seem to be able to get everyone' s back up.
Oh, I always get along very well with young people.
My patients all bring their children to me...... because they know I get along well with them.
So don' t you worry about that.
Thank you, Mr. Dussel.
Good night.
I' il be back.
Good night, Mr. Dussel.
Be careful.
Sanne.
Sanne?
Sanne!
Save me!
Save me!
No, no!
- No!
Don' t take me!
Stop it!
Save me.
Hush, Annie, hush.
It' s all right.
It' s all right.
Please, Mr. Dussel, turn on the light.
It was just a dream.
You' re here, safe, you see?
Something must be done with that child.
Yelling like that.
Who knows who might be in the street?
She' s endangering our lives.
Mr. Dussel, after all, Anne is not exactly a trained frontline soldier.
Please, Mr. Dussel, go back to bed.
She' il be herself in a minute or two, won' t you, Annie?
Hmph.
Excuse me.
I' m going to the W. C., the one room where there' s peace.
Go back to bed now.
Would you like some water?
Was it a very bad dream?
Perhaps if you told me?
I' d rather not talk about it.
Try to sleep, then.
ANNE:
You don' t have to.
But I' d like to stay with you.
Very much, really.
I' d rather you didn' t.
Good night --
You' il be all right?
There' s nothing that you want?
Will you please ask Father to come?
Yes, of course, Anne, dear.
She asked for you.
- Edith....
Go to her, Otto.
She' s still trembling with fear.
She wants nothing of me.
She pulled away when I leaned down to kiss her.
Anne.
It' s just a phase.
All girls turn to their fathers at this age.
They give all their love to their fathers.
You weren' t like this.
You didn' t shut me out.
So....
- Do you want me to read to you?
- No, just sit with me for a minute.
Was I awful?
- Do you think anyone outside heard me?
Now, lie down quietly so.
Like this.
Now try to sleep.
I' m a terrible coward.
I' m so disappointed in myself.
I think I' m really grown- up...... and then something happens, and I run to you like a baby.
I love you, Father.
I don' t love anyone but you.
- Annele.
ANNE:
It' s true.
You' re the only one I love.
I' ve been thinking about it for a long time.
It' s fine.
It' s fine to have you tell me that you love me...... but I' d be much happier if you said that you loved your mother as well.
She needs your help so much.
Your love.
We have nothing in common.
She doesn' t understand me.
Whenever I try to explain my views on life, she asks me if I' m constipated.
You hurt her very much just now.
She' s crying.
She is in there crying.
Oh, Father, I was horrible, wasn' t l?
What' s the matter with me?
Tell me.
Don' t say it' s just a phase.
Help me.
There is so little that we parents can do to help our children, Annie.
We can only try to set a good example, point the way.
The rest you must do yourself.
I' m trying.
Really, I am.
Every night, I think back over all the things I did that day that were wrong.
Like putting the wet mop in Mrs. Van Daan' s bed.
And now this with Mother.
I say to myself, "That was wrong."
And I make up my mind never to do that again.
Never.
I may do something worse, but I' il never do that again.
I have a nicer side, Father...... but I' m scared to show it.
I' m afraid people will laugh at me.
So the mean Anne comes to the outside...... and the good Anne stays in the inside.
And I keep on trying to switch them around...... have the good Anne outside...... and the bad Anne inside.
It would be what I' d like to be.
And might be.
If only....
She' s asleep.
Thursday, the 29th of October, 1942.
Mr. Dussel and I had a great battle yesterday.
Yes, Mr. Dussel.
According to him, nothing, I repeat, nothing, is right about me.
While he was going on at me, I thought:
"Someday, I' m going to give you such a smack...... that you 'il fly right up to the ceiling."
Why is it that every grownup thinks he knows the way to bring up children?
Particularly the grownups that haven 't any.
Monday, the 9th of November, 1942.
Wonderful news!
The Allies have landed in Africa!
That measure of....
MAN ON RADlO: -- which they have so often meted out to others.
Ah, this is not the end.
It is not even the beginning of the end.
No, but it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.
The air raids are getting worse.
The British planes come over, day and night, on their way to Germany.
It' s too much.
It' s just too much.
Suppose they hit this house?
What will we do?
We can' t go out in the street.
What will we do?
If they hit this house, your worries will be over.
That big explosion, an English plane fell right in this block!
Peter.
Peter!
It' s far away from here.
Please don' t.
Just look at them.
Mrs. Van Daan, this should be music to your ears.
FRANK:
Of course.
The more planes they send, the sooner the war will be over.
- The sooner we' il be home again.
- I don' t believe it' il ever be over.
Do you know what I' d like right now?
A cup of tea.
Oh, yes, please.
You can' t have tea, then, for breakfast.
If you have it now, you won' t have any tomorrow.
- I don' t care.
- Neither do l.
Me too, please.
How about you, Mr. Dussel?
Tea now or tomorrow morning?
- Tomorrow morning.
- Sure?
Sure.
I' il take mine now.
The skylight!
Edith, come!
Oh, Peter!
Peter!
Peter!
Peter!
Peter!
"Praised be thou, Lord, ruler of the universe...... who' s sanctified us with thy commandments...... and bidden us kindle the Hannukah lights.
Praised be thou, O, Lord, our God, ruler of the universe...... who wrought wondrous deliverances for our fathers in days of old.
Praised be thou, O, Lord, our God, ruler of the universe...... that thou hast given us life and sustenance...... and brought us to this happy season. "Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Monday, the 7th of December, 1942.
The Hannukah holiday came early this year.
"We kindle this Hannukah light...... to celebrate the wonderful deeds wrought through the zeal...... with which God filled the hearts of the heroic Maccabees 2000 years ago.
They fought against indifference...... against tyranny and oppression, and they restored our temple to us.
May these lights remind us that we should ever look to God...... whence cometh our help. "Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
"I lift up mine eyes unto the mountains from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved.
He that keepeth thee will not slumber.
He that keepeth lsrael doth neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord is thy keeper.
The Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.
The Lord shall keep thee from all evil.
He shall keep thy soul.
The Lord shall guard thy going out and thy coming in...... from this time forth and forevermore. "Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
May I have the hats, please?
Thank you.
Very nice, very nice.
- That was very moving.
- It isn' t over yet.
VAN DAAN:
Where are you going?
There' s lots more.
Songs and presents.
- Presents?
Not this year, unfortunately.
But always on Hannukah, everyone gives presents.
Everyone.
- That' s right.
- Like our St. Nicholas Day.
St. Nicholas Day.
No, not like St. Nicholas Day.
What kind of Jew doesn' t know Hannukah?
I remember particularly the candles.
First one, as we have tonight.
The second night, two.
The next night, three, and so on, until eight candles are burning.
When there are eight candles, it' s truly beautiful.
What I remember best are the presents we used to get, eight days of presents.
Each day, they got better and better.
We are all here, alive.
That' s present enough.
No, it isn' t.
I' ve got something.
Previously on "Lost"...
It was them.
The Others...
Have you seen other people on this island?
I hear them.
Out there, in the jungle.
They whisper.
They' ve attacked us, sabotaged us, abducted us!
We' re not the only people on this island, and we all know it!
Maybe it' s time we stopped blaming us and started worrying about them!
They came the first night, took three of us, then they came back and took nine more.
They' re smart, and they' re animals, and they could be anywhere at anytime, and if you think that one gun and one bullet is gonna stop them... think again.
Shannon!
This is not your island.
This is our island, and the only reason you' re livin 'on it is' cause we let you live on it.
They' re getting closer!
Move it!
Burn those!
Shred faster!
Hurry up!
Sayid!
Take these files!
Burn them!
Keep shredding you cowards!
We leave when I say!
Stop again, and I' il kill you myself!
I' m your commanding, officer, and you will do --
Stop!
Get down!
Get the hell down!
Get down, get down!
You, no, no, no, drop your gun on the ground now!
Freeze!
On the ground now!
Stop burning that stuff!
Get the hell down!
Who' s in charge here?
I said who' s in charge?!
Somebody better tell him to stop, or god help me, he' s dead!
They don' t understand, sergeant.
They understand.
Listen up!
I' il fire on three!
One, two...
Stop shredding or they' il kill you!
You!
You in charge?
- No, I am not.
- Who is?
There is no commanding officer here.
He left two hours ago for Hillah.
Your English is good, Abdul, but you' re lying, and that ain' t so good.
That' s him, sergeant.
Let' s go, hombre.
Son, we don' t want to be here any more than you do, and your pal Saddam had to go marchin 'into Kuwait, so here we all are.
Buccelli here says you speak English.
You ever do any translatin '?
Formally?
No.
Hell, fact you know what "formally" means, well, we' re good.
Apache helicopter went down in this sector two days ago.
Our sources tell us the pilot was captured.
It' s very important that we get this pilot back.
We know he was taken to the local Republican Guard intelligence commander -- a man named Tariq.
Do you know him?
Yes, he was our commanding officer.
You know where he is?
When the bombing started, he fled to Hillah.
Hillah, huh?
Yes, that is right.
Welcome to Hillah.
Where' s Jack?
Why?
There.
See?
Go back.
I' il deal with this.
What?
Go back, Ana Lucia, and don' t tell anyone what you saw.
What are you doing here, Danielle?
Looking for you.
Where are we going?
You said you were looking for me.
What was your plan -- to hide in the woods, hoping I would pass you by?
I was going to wait until dark, then find you at your tent.
Why?
We need to keep moving.
Not until you tell me where we' re moving to.
Trust me.
The last time we met, you arrive to warn us the others were coming, which they weren' t.
In fact, it was a diversion to kidnap Claire' s baby, so pardon me for not trusting you.
This place I' m taking you to -- there is something that will help you, something important.
So trust.
Take this.
If I' m lying, it' s yours to use.
How much further?
Not far.
Ask him where he took the pilot.
They want to know where the pilot is.
Tell him his mother is a goat.
He says he does not know.
Look, we know for a fact he interrogated the pilot day before yesterday -- hell, probably in this room.
Tell him we get our man back safe and sound, he goes free.
They will let you go if you tell them where the pilot is.
You are a disgrace.
You' re an Iraqi soldier!
Steal his gun and kill them all.
Right there on his belt.
You can get a few of them before you are killed.
What' s he saying?
He says he does not know.
I was born, but I wasn' t born yesterday, son.
Now you don' t help me out here, someone else will take over, and that someone, he won' t play nice at all.
I am sorry.
He does not know.
Okay.
You had your chance.
G uards?
Lock him back up.
This is unbelievable.
Hey.
Hey, you hear that thing?
You hear that frog?
The frog?
You want to help me find it?
What, we ain' t friends anymore?
What do you got there, Rerun?
Nothin '.
Yeah, well, you got a spot of "nothin '" on your chin, there.
"Dharma initiative ranch dressing."
You know, you' re supposed to refrigerate that after you open it.
Well, actually on the back it says it' il keep at room temperature for up to 7 years.
Well, well, looky who' s got a secret stash.
Please, dude, you can' t tell.
What, that you stole food from the group?
Now why would I want to do that?
Come on, man, please?
Son of a bitch.
Dude, it' s just a tree frog.
- Have you seen it?
- Yeah.
Tell you what -- you help me find that thing, you can keep right on ranch dippin '.
We got a deal?
How much further?
- Danielle?
- We' re here.
And where exactly is "here"?
What is that for, Danielle?
Help me!
Hey!
Over here!
Wait.
- Help!
- Sayid, listen to me.
Hey!
Aah!
Over here!
Please!
Help me!
Help me!
Don' t believe a word he says.
Hey!
He' s one of them.
I have no idea what she' s talking about.
She' s crazy.
How long has he been up there?
Since last night.
Please, just cut me down.
My name is Henry Gale.
I' m from Minnesota.
- Please.
- He' s lying.
I' m going to cut him down.
Don' t.
Thank you.
You' re making a serious mistake.
It' s okay, it' s okay.
You' re all right.
You' re all right.
Hold on.
Take it easy.
Oh, no.
Wait!
Danielle, don' t!
You could have killed him.
If I wanted to kill him, I would have killed him.
You shot this man with no provocation.
He is one of them!
Tie him up.
You should take him to your doctor.
He' s no good to you dead.
And then what?
You talk to him, Sayid.
As I recall, that is what you do.
But know this -- he will lie.
For a long time, he will lie.
I want to talk to you about your buddy Tariq.
All right, look, I get it.
You' re a man who values loyalty.
Even doing a little translating for us, you feel like you' re doing the wrong thing.
I get that, and I respect it.
This is what Tariq was doing before he took over command of your intelligence unit.
He was the head of a chemical warfare battalion in the north, personally supervised the use of Sarin gas on this village.
You recognize it, don' t you?
You had relatives in that village, didn' t you, Sayid?
So you know what Sarin gas does.
No discrimination.
The entire marketplace.
Innocent women... children.
Enough...
Please.
Loyalty is a virtue, but unquestioning loyalty --
I don' t think that' s you.
Why should I believe you?
How do you think we knew you had relatives in that village?
We liberated your personnel file and Tariq' s.
All we want is our pilot back, so we can send him home to his family.
Tariq will never talk to you.
That' s why you' re gonna have to make him talk to you.
John.
John, wake up.
What?
Come out here.
Minnesota, huh?
That' s the question, isn' t it?
Where am I?
- Who are you?
- Henry.
Henry Gale.
Aah!
My back!
We' re going to take it out, but first I want you to relax.
How did you get to this island?
Four months ago, we crashed, my wife and I.
- Crashed in what?
- A balloon.
We were trying to cross the Pacific.
Your wife -- where is she?
She died.
She got... she got sick three weeks ago.
We were staying in a cave off the beach.
My shoulder.
At least untie my arms!
What the hell is going on here?
Rousseau trapped him in the jungle.
- She believe she' s an other.
- An "other" what?
- You shot him with an arrow?
- Do I have a bow?
Hey, hey, you with me?
What, you were just gonna let him bleed to death?
I was trying to get honest answers while he was able to give them... and his wound is far from life- threatening.
We should let Jack treat him first, then we' il get our answers.
Jack... do not untie him.
This is how people get killed in scary movies.
If it were a scary movie, I' d be with a hot chick, not you, Barbar.
- It' s Babar.
- How about you shut up, Hammo, or your ranch disorder' s gonna be the new lead item on the coconut internet.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Tell everyone the fat guy' s been hiding ranch dressing, the fat guy who likes to eat.
You think I don' t know that?
At least people like me.
You know what?
Find the damn frog by yourself.
Hurley, wait!
Wait!
Hey, Hurley!
Look, man, I' m sorry, all right?
This frog is killin 'me.
You gotta help me out...
Please.
So what do you think?
What do you think, John?
I think he' s pretty convincing.
Yes, he is.
The real problem is there' s no way we can be sure he' s telling the truth.
That is not necessarily true.
Does Jack have the combination to the armory?
For now, he does.
How long would it take for you to change it?
looking for someone to punish...
Why would I need to punish anyone?
I want to find out who he is.
I want the truth.
And I think we both know that Jack will have issues with what must be done in order to get it.
So how long, John, to change the combination?
A couple minutes, tops.
Then I suggest you get started.
Did he say anything while you were treat --
No, he didn' t.
He was in shock.
We can' t just leave him layin 'here, Jack.
People will see him and create a panic.
Yeah?
Well, where do you think we should put him?
I say we put him in the armory.
It' s secure.
Better to err on the side of safety, Jack, at least until we can be sure.
Okay.
For now.
All right, pull that cot in here.
He shouldn' t be on his back.
Good idea.
Sayid!
Hey, what the hell you doin '?
What needs to be done.
They' re letting speak to me alone now?
You need to tell me where the helicopter pilot is.
This is their new bluff?
That you' re going to torture me?
They think you will do this?
Sayid, you are a loyal soldier.
The son of a great hero.
Do not disgrace your father!
You wouldn' t dare harm me!
You will follow my orders as your commanding officer!
Take that bag.
Put it over your head and tape it up.
Kill yourself, now!
That' s an order.
Do it and die with what little honor you have left.
You would have me take my own life... the information means nothing to you!
The pilot was executed two days ago.
He is buried in a field 4 kilometers from here.
I can take you there.
Damn it.
Sayid, open the door!
- Sayid, answer me!
- Jack.
Why isn' t this combination working, John?
Did you change it?
Yeah.
Why would you do that?
You' re raising an army.
What?
And why you didn' t ask me to help, well, that' s your business, but there' s only one reason to raise an army, Jack, and that' s because we' re at war.
And like it or not, whatever Sayid has to do behind that door, that' s a part of it, too.
What if he' s telling the truth, John?
What if he' s not?
Get up.
What' s happening?
Here, let me help you.
You said you' ve been here for four months.
What?
You said you came to this island four months ago, yes?
Where am I?
Please answer my question.
Yeah -- yes, we landed four months ago, maybe more.
Who are you?
And you were in a cave for all that time?
Off the beach... on the north shore of the island.
How far from this beach to where you were captured?
I don' t know.
- How many days' walk?
- Two -- two days.
Why did you stay on the beach for so long?
Why wouldn' t we?
We wanted to be there for flyovers.
We had an emergency beacon -- a transmitter.
- What kind of transmitter?
- An A. D. F. beacon.
We wanted to make sure we' d be spotted.
Look, whatever you think I am, I' m not.
Please -- please just... tell me your name.
You wife -- what is her maiden name?
Murphy.
- Where did you meet her?
- University of Minnesota.
How did she die?
She got sick.
She got sick?
It started as a fever.
After two days, she was delirious... then she died.
I don' t know why you' re asking me all these questions.
I don' t know why you' re treating me this way... why I have to explain to you who I am when you don' t tell me who you are.
I was 23 years old when the americans came to my country.
I was a good man.
I was something different.
I did things I wish I could erase from my memory, things which I never thought myself to be capable of... but I did come to learn this -- there is a part of me which was always capable.
You want to know who I am?
My name is Sayid Jarrah... and I am a torturer.
Where is it?
There it is.
Gotcha.
Dude, nice catch.
Well, I' il be damned.
All that noise from this tiny critter.
Kind of reminds me of a turtle I once had.
His name was Stewart.
He ran off when I was 10.
Well, that' s what mom said.
I kinda think she threw him out.
Well, you' re a happy little fella, ain' t ya?
I have an idea.
Why don' t I take him far from here, two beaches away?
Tree frog.
That way, he won' t keep you up anymore, and everyone' s happy.
Yeah, that' s one idea.
Here' s another.
Dude.
I hear with a little ranch, they taste just like chicken.
Give you a hand?
- Jack, I know this -- - Shut up.
Where are the pliers?
Tell me about this balloon.
What?
This balloon that brought you here with your wife -- tell me about it.
What do you want to know?
Everything.
She' s 140 feet high, 60 feet wide... and when she' s up in the air, 550, 000 cubic feet of helium and 100, 000 of hot air keep her up.
And if you could look down on her, you' d see a big, yellow smiley face on top.
Why would you travelin that way?
Because I was rich, because... it was my dream...
and Jennifer thought it would be neat.
You were rich.
I guess I' m thinking of things in the past tense now.
How' s that for optimism?
What did you do to become so rich?
- I sold my company.
- What kind of company?
- Mining.
- What did you mine?
We mined nonmetallic minerals.
I know, everyone wanted to talk to me at cocktail parties.
Give me your hands.
Give me your hands!
Where is she buried?
- What?
- Listen to me.
You said you buried your wife.
Tell me where.
- What are you gonna -- - Wwhere?!
In the jungle!
By the balloon, in the jungle.
How deep?
How deep did you dig the grave?
I don' t...
How deep?
How many shovelfuls of earth?
Did you use your hands?
How long did it take you?!
- I don' t remember!
- You would remember!
You would remember how deep!
You would remember every shovelful, every moment!
You would remember what it felt like to place her body inside.
You would remember if you buried the woman you loved.
You would remember, if it were true!
Did you... did you lose someone?
Did you lose someone here on the island?
Did you lose someone, too?
What happened to her?
It was an accident.
It was an accident.
The woman responsible thought she was someone else, someone coming to hurt her.
Someone like you!
Just -- just -- this is all a mistake.
Slow down here, okay?
Hurting me isn' t gonna bring her back.
You know what I lost!
Tell me the truth!
Tell me who you are!
No!
No!
No!
Help!
Stop!
Tell me the truth!
Tell me who you are!
Sayid!
Sayid!
Jack.
- Open it.
- Jack, this has to happen.
Open that damn door, you understand me?!
You open it now!
No.
Now!
What do you want me to say?!
Whatever you want me to do, I' il do it!
Just -- please...
I want you to tell me the truth!
Open the door.
- Let go of me, Jack.
- Or what?
You want to pushthe button?
Open the door.
It' s under a minute now, John.
You better think fast.
- You wouldn' t.
- What?
I wouldn' t what?
If we don' t... you would risk everyone' s lives?
You talked me into pushing that button once, John, but it' s yours now.
You' re the onewho won' t risk it, you.
Me?
I don' t think anything' s gonna happen when we get down to zero.
Jack...
You want to see what' s gonna happen?
Let' s just see what' s gonna happen.
Who are you?!
Who are you?!
Okay, okay, okay, right, 15, left --
You think I' m stupid?
You open it!
- He' s lying!
- Not like this!
I' il tell you whatever you want!
He' s lying!
He' s lying!
That' s enough!
What the hell was that?
He is one of them.
Yeah?
Did he tell you that?
- No.
- Then how do you know?
Because I know.
He is one of them.
I think that' s what Rousseau thought about you once, Sayid.
If I' m not mistaken, she strapped you down, she shocked you, all because she thought you were one of them.
- He is.
- What?
He is one of them.
To Rousseau, we' re all "others."
I guess it' s all relative, huh?
You got a wife?
Kids?
I' il take him.
It' s over.
We' re pulling out, not going to Baghdad.
So your man Saddam gets to stay in power, which means you, in all likelihood, will remain in his employ.
Guess you' re lucky to have a new skill set you can use.
What you made me do, no human being should ever have to do to another.
One of these days... there will be something you need to know.
And now... you know how to get it.
I will never do that again.
Yeah.
Good luck to you, Sayid.
Bus fare back to Ramadi.
Let' s move out.
There is a man down in the hatch... a stranger captured by Rousseau.
I beat him.
I beat him badly.
Why are you telling me this, Sayid?
Jack asked me how I knew -- knew for sure that this man was lying, how I knew for sure that he was one of them, one of the others.
I know because I feel no guilt for what I did to him.
But there is no way I can ever explain that to Jack or even Locke... because both of them have forgotten.
Forgotten?
What?
That you were strung up by your neck and left for dead, that Claire was taken and kept for days, during which God only knows what happened to her, that these people, these "others", are merciless... and can take any one of us whenever they choose.
So tell me, Charlie.
Have you forgotten?
Transcript:
Travis www. subtitlesbox. com
- Ready Virge?
- Anytime.
Turn him out!
VlRGE:
He' s yours, Bo.
Get him.
Get on him, Bo!
Turn him over!
Get him over.
Get him over.
- What' s my time?
- Five- eight.
I' il win every prize they' ve got down at that rodeo!
Bo...... when you was 5, I throwed you on a horse, and you was riding.
- Remember?
- Yeah.
When you was 8, I throwed you in the creek, and you was swimming.
- Ain' t that right?
- Sure, Virge.
Splash!
You' re 21 years old, and we' re on our way to a big city:
- It' s time you met up with a gal.
Nothing to be scared of.
Women and swimming is pretty much the same.
You got good reflexes.
You' il make out just fine.
Win some prize money.
- Take it easy!
- Two for Phoenix.
- We' re going down for the rodeo.
I' m gonna win me about every prize they got.
That' s nice.
You got a long ride ahead of you.
Bo, the lady' s hat!
- Oh, sorry, ma' am.
- Look where you' re going.
It' s his first time off the ranch.
Virge, that' s a lie, and you know it!
I' ve been all the way to Helena.
That was when he was 12, to have his tonsils out.
- That still counts!
- Give me that.
Virge?
I' ve been thinking, you know, about what you said.
What was that?
You know, about me finding a gal.
Oh.
What about it?
I don' t know anything about gals, Virge.
Nothing at all.
That' s what I mean.
It' s about time you learned.
Ain' t nothing to be scared of, Bo.
You liked swimming when you got used to it.
Besides, I know the idea crossed your mind.
I seen you looking at them pictures in Orville' s magazine.
Maybe I glanced at them pictures a couple of times.
But if I do find me a gal, it won' t be one from those magazines.
I already decided.
I' m gonna get me a angel.
- A angel?
- That' s right.
I wouldn' t set my sights too high if I were you, Bo.
You just pick out some plain- looking little gal...... with a cooperating nature and a good personality.
I mean, we gotta be realistic.
What' s some angel gonna want with a cowhand like you?
What' s that got to do with it?
That steer didn' t wanna get throwed.
Well, I throwed him.
Breaking in a wild horse...... you don' t let what he wants stop you.
What makes you think a gal' s different?
This trip will be mighty educational.
Listen, Virge, I' m gonna find me an angel, a real hootenanny of an angel.
She gives me any trouble...... she' il find herself with her wings pinned right to the ground!
- Morning, ma' am!
- What are you doing?
Pushups, to get the kinks out of my bones.
Get up off that floor.
Thirty.
Did 30 sit- ups too.
Stop bothering folks.
Woke up everybody on the bus.
It' s morning.
It' s time to get up.
That' s the trouble with you city folk.
Lay in bed all day long.
Then you get soft.
When do we stop for breakfast?
Look, there' s a place.
You passed it!
This is a public vehicle.
Stops where it' s scheduled to stop, no place else.
Meanwhile, what' s a passenger to do?
Starve to death?
Poor old lady' s stomach is rumbling.
Bo!
You' re in civilization.
Forgive him, ma' am.
He didn' t hear a thing.
Our next stop is Grace' s Diner...... couple of miles up the road.
That' s where we stop.
Grace' s!
Can we get some breakfast here?
- Hello, Grace.
- Look what the cat dragged in.
- Elma, you the passenger?
- Right.
- She' s going for the concert.
- And to see my sister.
Service!
- Your passengers are hungry.
- I' il go and wait on them.
Some crazy cowboys.
That young one is a real troublemaker.
His friend ain' t so bad.
He just sits playing guitar.
Little music' s nice when you' re driving along.
I' m very fond of music myself.
Are you, Grace?
I didn' t know that.
Yeah, I' m a very musical person.
Come on in.
I' il fix you something to eat.
Ma' am!
Ma' am --
Give me three hamburgers.
- Three?
How do you want them?
- Honest?
- That' s the only way to eat them.
With a hunk of onion and some pickle, and a piece of pie.
And a quart of milk.
He' s still a growing boy.
All right.
Pie and coffee.
I' m growing too, but in a different way.
Gotta watch my figure.
Real nice place you got here.
Much as I' ve seen of it.
What does that mean?
I bet that apartment you got upstairs is real nice too.
I' d love to see it sometime.
Have you got it fixed up?
Don' t pour it!
Let' s get going.
We' il never make Phoenix...... sitting in this miserable restaurant!
- Hey, you!
- All aboard, folks.
Wait!
I happen to be the owner of this miserable restaurant.
Don' t pay him no mind, ma' am.
It' s just his way of talking.
- I don' t care for it.
- I don' t blame you a bit.
Virge!
This place is nice and clean and well- run.
You couldn' t ask for a prettier owner.
Wait a minute.
I mean it, and I wanna apologize for this barbarian.
- What you doing?
- Something I seen in a movie.
- It don' t offend you, I trust.
- No, just caught me up short.
Hand kissing!
That ain' t my idea on how to get a gal.
We know that.
- Bye, Grace.
- So long, honey.
- You the guitar player?
- That' s right, ma' am.
I' m real fond of music myself.
All aboard.
Grace, see you in a couple of days.
So long, Carl.
Good luck in the rodeo, cowboy.
- Thanks, ma' am.
- Come back real soon.
- So long, Carl.
- So long, Grace.
Come back soon, hear?
Talk about angels!
How about her?
Well, she may be a angel, Virge.
- She ain' t my angel.
- How can you tell?
I' il know.
When I see my angel, I' il know right off the bat.
Fasten your seat belts.
Take off your coats.
We' il be landing in Phoenix in an hour.
I' m sorry to leave you folks, but this is where we get off.
"Welcome, cowboys.
The town is yours. "
That' s us, Virge!
That' s us!
Don' t let him take any wooden nickels.
I' il drive you back, if you' re still in one piece.
Don' t you worry about us.
We' il be all right.
You just drive your bus.
Let' s register.
- ls that our hotel?
- Bo!
Bo, wait till the corner!
Remember, they go when it' s green, they stop when it' s red.
Never seen so many gals.
There must be a hundred head of them!
Bo!
Wait till it turns green.
You' re gonna wash yourself away!
What are you doing?
Ain' t got this at home.
Shower and bath at the same time.
Bo, you have a terrible habit of overdoing everything.
Come on!
lf you' re gonna dawdle, I' m gonna step across the street.
That Blue Dragon seems interesting.
You go ahead.
I' il be there in a couple of minutes.
MAN:
Wait outside!
Why aren' t you outside where you belong?
I' ve had enough of you, you ignorant hillbilly.
Get to work!
Better change into your costume.
- He called me an ignorant hillbilly!
- Ain' t you?
Not ignorant, but you do come from the Ozarks.
I ain' t sung hillbilly since I was....
Well, not since I turned chanteuse.
I' ve been trying to be somebody.
Can you imagine Hildegarde doing her number...... sitting in some truck driver' s lap?
- I don' t know why you just don' t quit.
- I can' t.
Look!
I don' t get paid till Wednesday.
I owe for my room and everything.
Besides that, it took me too long to get this far.
- What' s that line for?
- That line?
You might say that this line here is a history of my life up till now.
- Yeah.
That' s River Gulch, the little old town where I was born.
- I never even heard of it.
- Well, it ain' t there anymore.
Floods washed us all away, all except me and my sister, Nan.
I just picked her up and took her along this line...... till we got to Lubbock, Texas.
You know what happened there?
Nan got this job as a waitress, and I worked in Liggett' s Drugstore.
And this amateur contest opened...... and Nan said to me, "Why don' t you enter that contest?
You' ve been watching people in movies. "
We used to live in the movies.
"You' ve watched people put over their gestures."
And so I did it, and I won it.
- First prize?
- No, second prize.
Two boys juggling milk bottles won first prize.
Anyway, that' s how I got my direction and all.
- Direction?
- lf you don' t have a direction...... you keep going round in circles.
Look, you can see by this just how straight my direction is.
River Gulch.
And look where I' m going.
- Where?
- Hollywood and Vine!
Look, straight as an arrow!
River Gulch...... Hollywood and Vine!
What happens when you get there?
You get discovered.
You get tested, with options and everything.
And you get treated with respect too.
What' s going on in here?
She' s changing into her costume.
You want her out there naked?
Take care of them tables.
Come on, Dinah Shore.
Them cowboys is getting real lonesome.
Zip her up.
Go zip yourself up.
He looks like the safest.
I never know what to say.
It' s easy.
Just say some cute little joke.
Like, "Hello, buy me a drink?
I' m so dry, I' m spitting cotton. "
That' s a real cute one.
Go on.
Hello, mister.
- Howdy.
- I wonder if you' d buy me a drink.
I' m so dry, I' m spitting cotton.
That' s a good one, it is.
Whiskey for the lady, beer for me.
You sure have a good head for whiskey.
I' m not keeping track, but that' s four in a row.
Oh, that' s the way I am.
Sometimes I drink all night long.
Happy days.
What you doing?
Let go of me.
- That ain' t whiskey.
- Let go!
- That' s tea.
- That' s all they let us drink here.
Last night I had to drink 15 tea and sodas.
You' ve been hustling me for drinks!
I can' t stand a woman making a sucker out of me!
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen!
I know you ain' t paying attention, you' re too busy enjoying yourselves.
But we got this little floorshow and we have to do it.
Hope it don' t disturb you none.
Okay, baby, take it away.
- That' s her, Virge.
That' s my angel.
Angel?
She' s just a gal works in a saloon.
Look at her gleaming there...... so pale and white.
Quiet!
Shh!
Keep quiet over there!
That' s better!
Now keep it quiet!
The lady' s trying to sing!
Sit down, cowboy.
- That goes for you too, mister.
Quiet!
Okay, miss, you can go on with your song now.
- Where were we, Henry?
"I should stay away."
The lady' s finished.
You can start your yammering again.
Go ahead, start yammering!
My name' s Beauregard Decker.
I' m 21, and I own a ranch in Montana.
I got a herd of cattle and horses...... and the finest sheep, hogs and chickens.
And you' re it.
I don' t have time to sweet- talk...... so I' d be obliged to you if you' d step outside with me.
What' d you say?
My name is Beauregard Decker.
I' m 21 years old, and I own my own ranch in Timber Hill, Montana --
- I heard all that.
- Let' s get out of here.
No, uh... l' m mighty grateful to you for what you did...... but we' re not allowed to go out with the customers.
But you can buy me a drink if you want to.
- I' m so dry, I' m spitting cotton.
- I don' t use it.
I ain' t got time.
I wanna be in bed by 10: 00.
I' m in the rodeo tomorrow, so I need my sleep.
- Will you come on?
- We' re not supposed --
VlRGE:
- Hold my hat.
- Where you going?
- Splash!
- You' re sure a good singer.
- I' m a chanteuse.
That' s why I call myself "Cherie."
That' s my name, Cherie.
- That' s all the name you' ve got?
- That' s all you need.
Like Hildegarde.
She' s a chanteuse too.
Cherry.
Cherie!
It' s French.
It means "dear one."
It means something too.
- What' s it mean?
You' d laugh.
- No, I wouldn' t.
- Yes, you would.
Honest, I wouldn' t.
Well...... it means "good- looking."
I never told that to a single person.
My ma was French.
That' s a real pretty name.
Beauregard.
You are too.
Real beauregard.
Everybody just calls me Bo.
- Cherry.
- Cherie.
It was nice how you made everybody shut up.
Like you had respect for me.
You made them have respect too.
- I liked that.
- You did?
- Yes.
- Did you like me too?
At first, I thought you was some kind of a hooligan...... yelling and stomping like that.
But when I realized you was doing it for me...... l was attracted to you.
Attracted?
- You was?
- I still am.
You still are?
Really attracted?
- It' s only a physical attraction.
- Physical?
I mean, you' re so big and strong and...... well, so darn healthy looking.
Guess I am in pretty good shape.
You gotta be to compete in all five events --
Cherry.
Beauregard.
Sir, have you seen Cherie?
The gal you were sitting with.
She went off with another customer.
It' s time for the second show.
I want you to be the first to know.
After all, it was your idea.
- What was?
- I' ve found me that gal like you said.
Cherry and me, we' re engaged.
- We' re what?
- Engaged.
Virge, I want you to meet Cherry.
Cherry, this is Virge.
He' il be living with us.
- We already met.
- Someone' s got the wrong idea here.
- What do you mean, Cherry?
- I told you my name is Cherie.
I can' t say it fancy like that.
What' s the matter with Cherry?
Well, it ain' t dignified.
The rodeo starts tomorrow afternoon.
We' il get married out there!
- Married?
Out where?
- At the rodeo.
Tomorrow, after the finals, we' il all catch the bus back.
You don' t know nothing about this gal.
I know she' s my angel, that' s good enough for me.
Sixty cents a shot.
And it wasn' t whiskey she was drinking, it was tea.
Of course it was, Virge!
Angels don' t touch no liquor!
I just can' t help myself.
Cut it out!
Everybody' s looking.
Let them.
Ain' t no crime when we' re getting married tomorrow.
We' il be very happy together, till death do us part.
I better get to bed.
Virge, come on, let' s get going.
We' il make the rest of the plans in the morning.
For a wedding present...... l' il get you a deep- freeze or an electric washer...... or any other major appliance you want.
Good night, darling.
You' re on again.
What' s the matter?
What happened?
You know something?
I' m not quite sure.
This whole thing is probably my fault.
I told you it was about time you started learning about women.
I ain' t saying this gal you picked ain' t a good one to practice on.
But a fella can' t go marrying the first gal he meets.
- Why not?
- Better get your mind on that rodeo.
Fellas at the ranch got their money on you.
She has no intention of marrying you.
Yes, she has, Virge.
She' s got a physical attraction to me.
She said so herself.
- Virge.
- Yeah, Bo?
What' s the difference between a physical attraction...... and just a regular attraction?
A gal can be attracted to a fella...... for lots of reasons.
- His mind, for instance.
- His mind?
Sure.
Like if he' s smart or reads poetry...... or something.
- No kidding?
- That' s right.
I can read and write.
I don' t know no poetry, but I can recite the Gettysburg Address.
- Would that count?
I doubt it, but it might.
That old black magic has me ln its spell, that old....
l should stay away but what can I do l hear your name
Cherry!
- Morning, ma' am!
- Wait a minute.
We' re gonna be married.
[KNOCKlNG]
Cherry, wake up.
It' s Beauregard!
Morning, Cherry!
Let' s get a little air.
- Young man, I don' t allow callers --
Get out of bed.
The parade starts at 10: 30.
- I don' t want any trouble.
- How do I know you' re engaged?
Cherry, wake up and tell her you know me.
What?
- Oh, it' s you!
- You see, she knows me.
For the love -- I don' t know what' s going on....
Come on.
We gotta get going.
We' re getting married today.
We got lots to do.
What' s the idea, busting in here like that?
- What time is it?
I' ve been up for hours.
I didn' t get to bed till 5!
Five?
No wonder you' re so pale and white.
Cherry, know what that is out there?
That' s the sun.
Will you get out?
I' il call the police.
You shouldn' t stay up so late.
When we get up to the ranch, we' il hit the sack every night at 7: 30.
We better get something straight.
I have no intention in the world of marrying you.
- So get it out of your head.
- We' il talk all that over on the way.
You see, the problem is...... you just haven' t had time yet to get attracted to my mind.
I know all about your mind I ever wanna know.
I know the Gettysburg Address.
Busting in here like a wild lndian of some kind.
Cherry?
What?
"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth a new nation...... dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we' re engaged in a civil war...... to determine whether any nation so conceived can long endure.
- We are met on a battlefield -- "- I hate parades.
I' m not going.
"The world will not remember what we say here...... but it' il never forget what they did here.
- It is for us to be...
- Let me sleep.... so concentrated and so dedicated.... "
Any further and you' il miss the parade.
Elliot, got anything?
Would you hold it please, miss?
We' re from LlFE.
LlFE magazine?
That' s right.
"LlFE Goes to a Rodeo."
Or "rodeo" to you.
They wanted me to ride in the parade, but then I couldn' t see it.
Come on in here.
Excuse us.
Come on, we' re gonna see us a parade real good.
Can' t we find a place to sit down?
You didn' t let me get no sleep.
Hop up on my shoulder.
You can rest and see good at the same time.
- Bo, you put me down!
- This is a nice arrangement.
Can you see everything?
- Too much.
Look!
I' m glad I' m not in this parade so I can see it.
Here come Daniel Boone' s men!
This is a hootenanny of a parade.
Ain' t they talented?
Ain' t they resplendent?
Look, there' s cowgirls, and they got --
Where is he?
- You gonna marry him?
- No!
- Then you gonna go to the rodeo?
- No.
- What you gonna do?
- Run away.
What' s going on up there?
Who you signaling at?
Two.
Vera is a friend of mine.
She' s gonna get two tickets to the rodeo to watch you.
Get two tickets for the rodeo.
Two?
Hey, there' s old Virge!
Yahoo!
Stop it!
- Here we are, Virge.
We' re watching.
You' re doing just -- CHERlE:
Hello there.
Stop it, Bo!
Sorry, lady, you' re over there in the bleachers.
Over there?
It' s so much nicer here in the shade.
That' s right.
Come on, honey.
They got us over here with the livestock.
We go into our first contest of the afternoon:
Cowboy saddle bronc riding.
The contestant is required to ride 10 seconds.
That was Duane Howard from North Dakota.
The next rider up is Guy Weeks from Texas.
There' s Casey Tibbs, five- time World Champion Rider...... twice All- Around Champion Cowboy of the World.
Watch our pickup man as he recovers Casey Tibbs, South Dakota.
- Cherie, wake up.
It' s him!
- Tell him to go away.
It' s him!
He' s gonna ride now.
We' re at the rodeo!
- What' s that green thing?
- That ain' t green.
Know what that is?
That old black magic That' s gonna make me win
What' s that he' s got around his neck?
Ain' t that your scarf?
So that' s where it went!
We have a newcomer from Timber Hill, Montana:
Bo Decker.
- I can' t look!
- You are stuck on him!
How about a hand?
Hey, Cherry!
Yahoo!
Yahoo!
You know, I think he is crazy.
Sure he is.
Crazy as a bedbug.
I told you he was.
He thinks we' re getting married this afternoon at the rodeo.
What makes him think that?
I don' t know.
Sure weren' t nothing I said.
After the parade, he dragged me to City Hall...... and bought a marriage license.
You didn' t sign nothing, did you?
I had to.
He was making such a fuss in front of all those people.
Honey....
Here' s a ride to watch.
The cowboy...... has drawn the toughest horse in our contest.
Don' t fall off.
He fell off.
ls that a diamond?
It ain' t exactly a diamond...... but it ain' t exactly not a diamond, either.
- He paid $43 for it.
- No kidding!
Plus tax.
He made me take it, but it ain' t on my finger.
And neither is that wedding ring he bought.
Wedding ring?
Oh, honey!
Calf roping is our next contest.
lt' s a race against time, and every second counts.
Notice the work of the horse, keeping the rope tight.
I' m gonna pretend that calf is Cherry.
- I' m gonna get her and rope her.
- Don' t let the calf get away.
Get going, Cherry!
Here' s our newcomer again, Bo Decker of Montana.
Was that fast enough for you, Cherry?
Who is she, Bo?
Come on.
Photographers from LlFE.
They' re heading this way.
- LlFE magazine?
- They almost took my picture.
Quick, my lipstick!
Would you please hand me my lipstick?
Smile!
Basic.
Thank you.
I didn' t have my lipstick on yet!
The most dangerous event is wild Brahma bull riding.
We have Cousin Hugo...... our bullfighting chimpanzee.
lt' s his job to ride on the dummy and attract the bull.
Cowboy clowns also distract the bull...... when the cowboy gets bucked off.
Don' t break your neck.
lf I was to break my neck, I couldn' t get married.
Him breaking his neck is the only hope you' ve got.
Here' s our old friend Bo Decker.
He still wears that green scarf.
Let' s hope it brings him luck.
Good ride, Bo.
Cherry!
Did you see me ride that bull?
Cherry!
Stop it!
- Cherry!
- He don' t have no manners at all!
No, but he' s got something else.
And he' s gonna get some little gal, you just watch.
Well, it ain' t gonna be me.
Besides, how can we get married?
He ain' t made no arrangements.
Silly.
Cherie, look.
Ain' t that a preacher?
Oh, my goodness!
Excuse me, please.
Where' s the one getting married?
- Getting married?
Here?
- That' s right.
- Boing!
Cowboy' s girl.
ANNOUNCER:
Bo' s also entered in our bulldogging contest.
How do I get out?
The exit' s over there.
To get to it you gotta go around --
Hey, where are you going?
Cherry!
What' s going on here?
Wait!
Where are you going?
- My shoe!
Cherry, come back!
Hey, somebody hold this thing for me.
She ain' t here, and I don' t know when she' s coming back.
I don' t believe you.
She' s here someplace.
She ain' t here.
We gotta go get you ready for the finals tonight.
I don' t care about the finals.
I want Cherry!
Cherry!
He don' t give up that easy.
I' m gonna end up in Montana with him and a bunch of cows.
What are you doing?
We' il stash your suitcase at the club for a quick getaway.
That' s the first place he' il look.
lf you don' t show up for work, you won' t get an advance.
You' re safe till it' s over.
Tell that cashier you gotta have money...... for your sick grandmother.
- My grandmother?
- I don' t understand that boy.
- What' s he got on his mind?
- Me.
I' m gonna find her, and I' m gonna marry her!
Get her off your mind till after the rodeo.
I ain' t gonna be in the rodeo tonight.
lf you go to the rodeo, I' il find her and hold her for you.
I' m not saying she' il marry you, but she' il be at the Blue Dragon.
- Okay, Virge, if you promise.
- I promise.
My poor old grandmother' s sick. lf I could just have an advance.
The boss has to okay it.
He' il be back when the rodeo' s over.
- Her grandmother' il be dead by then.
Let' s have a little drink.
Come on.
I' m so dry, I' m spitting cotton.
Two whiskeys, miss.
Take it easy, I' m on your side.
I don' t want him to marry you, neither.
- You don' t?
- I sure don' t.
ls that it?
I didn' t say that.
- Suppose he' s as pure as driven snow.
- As a matter of fact, he is.
You trying to tell me --
He never even kissed a gal before he met you.
He spent his whole life pretty far out in the country.
I know what happens there.
I' m from the country myself.
I' ve been kissing boys since --
That' s it.
You' re kind of sophisticated for Bo.
He didn' t kiss like it was the first time.
Well, Bo picks things up real quick.
- First time?
- That' s right.
Sure ain' t never had that honor before.
I hate to put you through this, but I promised I' d keep you here.
But I didn' t say anything about where you might go after that.
Vera' s sure gonna miss you, honey.
Oh, what was I supposed to say?
- I never was good at lying.
- It ain' t that complicated.
We just talk to him a while, then you turn casually and say:
"The show is gonna start pretty soon.
I guess I better go powder my nose. "
Then you go to your dressing room where your suitcase is.
You change, climb out the window and get down to the bus station.
The rodeo must be over.
Where' s Bo?
I know what.
He' s probably yelling and pushing some helpless animal around.
Whatever gave you an idea like that?
Nice to see you.
I was afraid you got trampled in that crowd.
- Where you been, Bo?
- I had a couple of errands to run.
I bought us three tickets for tonight' s bus to Montana.
By the way...... there' s $4000 I got for winning every event at the rodeo.
Except steer wrestling.
They gave me a bum steer.
Don' t give me credit for that.
Another fella thought it up.
Well...... our gear' s packed and waiting outside in the taxi.
We' il stop by Cherry' s house and get her suitcase.
Your nose is kind of shiny, ain' t it, Cherie?
Bo, the show is gonna start in just a minute...
... and I gotta go powder my nose.
Wait, you' re not gonna do your show tonight.
- I ain' t?
- You gotta go pack your suitcase.
It' s already packed --
I mean, I gotta go powder my nose.
Cherry, what' s the matter with you?
Are you sick?
No, I ain' t sick, Bo.
I just can' t lie to you.
I can' t marry you.
I ain' t going to Montana with you.
- And goodbye forever.
- Cherry, wait a second.
Cherry!
You ain' t got the manners they give a monkey!
I hate you and I despise you!
And give me back my tail!
Cherry!
- Here' s your bag.
- Here' s your coat and hat.
Cherry!
You can change down at the bus station.
I didn' t mean to rip your tail off.
You can sew it back on.
Good luck, honey.
Thanks, Vera, you' ve been real sweet.
Let her go, Bo.
Where' s she going?
Cherry!
Where' d she go?
Los Angeles, please.
One way. $9. 35.
Los Angeles bus at Gate 2.
Help me unload this stuff.
Forget her, Bo.
You' il find somebody else.
Hank told me about this new schoolmarm --
I don' t want no schoolmarm!
I want Cherry.
Cherry!
Cherry!
You just can' t take people places.
There' s laws against it.
- Which way is the Los Angeles bus?
Through there.
Miss, to the rear of the line.
Cherry, don' t get on that bus!
I made up my mind.
I ain' t gonna take no for an answer.
Miss, stand to the rear.
What are you doing?
Anything I ever wanted in this life I went out and got!
I' m sorry to wake you, but could you help me?
- What' s the matter?
- I' m being abducted.
- Abducted?
- You know, kidnapped.
By him.
Oh, that' s awful.
What are you gonna do?
I thought when we got someplace, I' d ask the driver to let me off.
We still ain' t no place at all.
Not only that, I' m freezing to death.
I don' t have much on under my coat.
You mean just your underthings?
No, it' s my costume, but it' s just a little old thing, without its tail.
lts what?
lts --
It' s a long story.
You' re shivering.
Don' t you have anything warm to put on?
- Will you help me change?
- Of course.
- Here, hold this up for me, will you?
- Sure.
Cherry?
Cherry, where are you?
Cherry!
Cherry?
What' s going on up here?
Get away from me!
I' m getting dressed.
You' ve caused enough trouble for one night.
Sit down!
I can' t figure it out.
Why don' t she like me?
Why?
Of course, if you loved him, it wouldn' t be so bad.
Yeah, but I don' t.
Not at all?
Some gals don' t like to be pushed and grabbed and lassoed...... and drug into buses in the middle of the night!
How else was I gonna get her on the bus?
Well, I' m asking you.
Go to sleep!
I don' t know why I keep expecting myself to fall in love, but I do.
I know I expect to someday.
I' m beginning to wonder if there' s the kind of love I have in mind.
- What' s that?
- I don' t know.
See, I' ve been going with guys since I was about 12.
Honest?
I almost married my cousin when I was 14.
Pappy wouldn' t have it.
I never heard of marrying so young.
Down in the Ozarks we don' t waste much time.
I sure am glad I never married my cousin Malcolm...... because he turned out real bad, just like Pappy predicted.
But I sure was crazy about him at the time.
And I' ve been losing my head about some guy ever since.
Bo' s the first one that ever wanted to marry me...... since my cousin Malcolm.
Naturally, I' d like to get married and have a family and all them things.
But you' ve never been in love?
I don' t know.
Maybe I have and I didn' t know it.
That' s what I mean.
Maybe I don' t know what love is.
I want a guy I can look up to and admire.
But I don' t want him to browbeat me.
I want a guy who' il be sweet with me.
But I don' t want him to baby me, either.
Whoever I marry has some real regard for me...... aside from all that...... loving stuff.
- You know what I mean?
- I think so.
This storm is getting terrible.
There' s Grace' s lights.
We' il make it.
You can sneak off when I get off.
I can if that wild man don' t wake up.
I wish I had my chains on.
Shh!
That' s as close as I can get.
We' il have to walk from here.
You sure picked some night for traveling.
Come on in.
This is Cherie.
We need someplace for her to hide.
She' s being abducted.
- She' s what?
- You know, kidnapped!
Yes, that' s right.
By a man in the bus.
A cowboy.
lf I could stay here till the bus pulls out again, I' d appreciate it.
- Huh?
- Road' s closed.
The bus is staying.
It may take the highway gang the rest of the night.
The rest of the night!
Driver, are we staying here?
My aunt and uncle are meeting us.
Don' t you think we ought to wake those cowboys up too?
It' s cold.
- Well, look what the cat dragged in.
- Hi, Grace.
Who' s that with you?
Aren' t they cute?
They' re visiting their aunt.
Looks like they' il visit their Aunt Grace.
For tonight, anyway.
Everybody is.
Highway' s all closed up ahead.
Oh, now, ain' t that too bad.
I hear you' re carrying a kidnapper on your bus.
You mean that cowboy?
He ain' t kidnapping nobody.
He' s asleep.
He' il freeze out there.
Wake him up.
Oh, no!
Couldn' t you let him sleep longer?
He' s had a busy day.
Two rodeos and a lot else.
Sure, let him sleep.
Works out better for everybody that way.
GRACE:
Ain' t no buses tonight.
You' re all stuck right here.
For the time, anyway.
You know something?
This is the first time we' ve had more than five minutes together.
- So what?
- I don' t know.
I was thinking about that apartment upstairs.
Sure would be nice to sit up there and listen to the radio.
Maybe have a couple of beers.
That wouldn' t be a hint, would it?
Where' s this place we' re at now, anyway?
Here.
It' s so little, it' s not even on the map.
I sure am way off my direction.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Your hands.
You got real big hands.
I' m big all over.
I used to be all- state wrestling champ.
No kidding?
I always admire a man who can fight.
Why didn' t anybody wake us up?
We might' ve froze!
Hey, close the door!
Cherry!
- How come you didn' t let me know?
- Shut the door!
How come you slip off the bus and come in here by yourself?
- Where was you brought up, in a barn?
- He was!
What' s the matter, afraid of a little fresh air?
Man' s right, it' s cold out.
Don' t give him no right to insult my manners.
No man ever had to tell me what to do, did he, Virge?
You opened the door, you should' ve closed it.
That' s all.
Door' s closed now, so what you arguing about?
Cherry, let' s you and me sit down --
That' s your suitcase.
For crying out loud, will you leave me be?
- Ain' t that your suitcase?
- Yes, that' s my suitcase.
What' d you bring it in here for?
I' m asking you a simple question.
What did you bring it in here for?
- Keep away from me, Bo.
- Will you --?
Keep out of this.
This is between me and Cherry.
ls that what it was?
- Take your hands off of me!
- Tell me.
- You tell me!
- Okay, cowboy, leave the lady alone.
You better keep out of this too.
It ain' t none of your business.
I ain' t so sure.
A bus driver' s like the captain of a ship.
The welfare of the passengers is his responsibility.
- Anything happens in the bus -- - We ain' t in a bus!
We' re in a bus stop.
This here' s an official, authorized bus stop!
- Ain' t it?
- When the sign' s up.
You still can' t interfere between two people gonna get married!
We ain' t getting married, but you' re too bullheaded to listen!
Cherry, you' re gonna marry me, and I ain' t gonna discuss it no more.
- ls there a preacher around here?
- Down the road, but he' s asleep.
We' re gonna wake him up and put him to work.
Help!
Shut up.
I' il make you a good husband.
- Now, cowboy, put her down.
- Open the door, Virge.
Virge, open the door.
I ain' t gonna open it, Bo.
- You ain' t?!
- No.
You been against this from the start!
That' s right.
I figured she wasn' t good enough for you.
Now I figure you ain' t good enough for her!
- You' re gonna put her down?
- You' re gonna get out of my way!
- You' il have to fight me first.
- I love a good fight.
I can' t stand a bully.
- Who says I' m a bully?
- I do!
Quiet!
A man' s got to fight for what he wants!
There' s a difference between a fighter and a bully!
But you' il only learn that if someone beats the living tar out of you.
He' s ripe for it.
I' d do it myself if I was big enough.
But you ain' t big enough!
And neither is he!
Ain' t no man ever got the best of me, and there ain' t gonna be!
I' m willing to try, cowboy.
Just step outside.
Delighted!
Make them stop!
Save yourself a lot of trouble.
Go in there and tell her you' re sorry.
- I ain' t sorry!
- He never is, that' s his trouble!
I' ve had enough of you telling me what' s right and wrong!
No, you ain' t!
You can stand a little bit more!
Virge!
What are you doing?
I' m starting a fight.
He' s gonna finish it for me.
Remember, every time he hits you, it' s me hitting you.
- Do you hear that?
It' s me!
- And it' il be me hitting you back!
Move over, I' m getting cold.
You' re doing great, mister!
- Gouge him, cowboy.
Bite him.
- Make them stop.
Come away from this window.
You don' t wanna watch things like that...... or you' re gonna grow up mean, just like all my brothers and cousins.
Sit down and behave yourselves.
You ought to be in bed.
Grace has a big bed upstairs, and a sofa too.
All right, boys, lay off them gas pumps.
Had enough, kid?
This is getting good.
Cherry....
Oh, Virge, make them stop before somebody gets killed!
Give up!
Come on, give up.
You ain' t got a chance.
- You had enough?
- No, he has to apologize to everybody.
And quit molesting that little girl!
- You heard what he said?
- Bo, you' re whipped, admit it.
Okay.
- Bo?
- Get away, damn it!
How about the promise, Bo?
- ls she gone?
- She' s gone.
- Okay, I promise.
- All right.
He' il be all right.
Come on, Bo, the storm is over.
I' m sorry it had to be like this.
It' s all over now.
Come on inside and wash up.
Get some coffee.
Come on.
You can' t stay out here.
I can' t go in there.
She seen me get whipped.
Carl, honey, you was just plain tremendous.
But I think I earned a cold beer you' ve got in the icebox...... upstairs.
Snowplow' s out.
Shouldn' t be too much longer.
Come on, Bo, cheer up.
We' il be back on the ranch tomorrow.
I don' t care if I ever see that ranch again.
Lonesomest place I ever did see.
Just like going back to a graveyard.
- Morning, honey.
- They' re sleeping just fine.
Must' ve read myself to sleep.
Such an interesting story.
- Can I have a cup of coffee?
- Elma just run it through.
- Bo?
- Yeah?
This would be a good time to keep your promise.
- Why should you be so scared?
- Who' s scared?
I' m gonna do it.
Just give me a little time.
I warn you, it ain' t gonna do no good unless you really mean it.
- I mean it.
- All right, then.
Go ahead.
Ma' am, I want to apologize.
- For what?
- For causing all that ruckus.
You don' t need to apologize to me.
I love a good fight.
You' re welcome at Grace' s Diner anytime.
- I mean anytime.
- Thanks.
I must' ve acted like a hoodlum.
I apologize.
- That' s all right.
- Thank you, miss.
- Have I got to wake him up?
- No, he can wait.
Virge, I can' t do it.
I just can' t do it!
- Why not?
- She seen me get beat.
You made me your promise.
You owe that girl an apology...... and you' re gonna say it to her.
Now go on, Bo.
Go on!
Well, don' t watch!
I' il do the dishes.
- I can do them.
No, you go on with the kids' breakfast.
Cherry?
Yes?
Cherry...... wasn' t right of me to do what I did to you, treating you that way.
Trying to make you marry me whether you wanted to or not.
Do you think you can ever forgive me?
I guess I' ve been treated worse in my life.
Well, I reckon that' s all there is to be said.
- I wish you luck, Cherry.
- I wish you the same, Bo.
Here' s your bandana back.
Thanks.
Here' s your ring.
I wish you' d keep that.
All right, Bo.
- Well, so long.
- So long.
Have some breakfast.
- I ain' t hungry.
- I couldn' t get it down.
[PHONE RlNGS]
- Phone!
- Turn the water off, honey.
Grace' s Diner.
What?
Oh, it is?
Okay, I' il tell him.
Hate to wake him, but the road' s cleared.
Hey, Carl!
The road' s cleared.
But put your chains on.
Still awful slick.
Elma?
Elma, better wake the kids up.
Bus will be ready to leave just as soon as I get my chains on.
Anybody wanna help me?
Sit here, Bo.
I' il help him.
Bo?
Yeah?
I wanted to tell you something.
It' s kind of personal, and embarrassing too.
But I ain' t the kind of girl you thought I was.
What do you mean, Cherry?
Well, I guess a lot of people' d say I' ve led a real wicked life.
And I guess I have too.
What are you trying to tell me?
I just figure that since you met me at the Blue Dragon...... that you took it for granted that I' d had other boyfriends before you.
You had?
Yes, Bo.
Quite a few.
Virge tried to tell me that, but I wouldn' t believe him.
Well, it' s true.
So you can see....
You' re better off.
I ain' t the kind of gal you thought I was at all.
Cherry...... would I be molesting you if I was to tell you something?
No.
Well, since you brought the subject up...... you are the first gal I ever had anything to do with.
I never thought I' d hear myself saying that, but I said it.
Virge told me that, but I couldn' t hardly believe him.
It' s the truth.
You see, I' ve lived all my life on a ranch.
I guess I just didn' t know anything about women.
- 'Cause they' re different from men.
- Well, naturally.
All ready to roll, folks.
Feeling better, cowboy?
Ain' t the happiest critter that' s ever been born.
I feel a little shook- up myself.
How about shaking hands?
Go ahead.
He' s just trying to be friends.
I don' t mind.
- No hard feelings?
- No hard feelings.
There' s a nice state, miss.
How about a cup of coffee, Grace?
- Nice fella, Bo.
- Maybe I' il think so someday.
Maybe we better be boarding the bus.
Cherry?
Hi, Bo.
Cherry, you won' t be getting on this bus.
I know that I promised not to molest you.
But if you' d give your permission that it' d be all right...... l' d like to kiss you goodbye.
I' d like for you to kiss me, Bo.
I really would.
- What?
I think this time it ought to be different.
Golly.
When you kiss somebody for serious...... it' s kind of scary, ain' t it?
Yes, it is.
- Here they are, all breakfasted.
- I' m still hungry.
See you Wednesday.
- Keep that beer on ice, Grace.
Maybe next time I' il get a chance to finish it.
All aboard!
Come on, kids.
Throw this water on the fire.
This bus stop is closed as of now.
Cherry?
Yes?
Virge has been figuring things out.
He says that seeing as how you had all them other boyfriends before me...... seeing as I never even had one single gal friend before you...... he figures that between the two of us it kind of averages out...... to things being proper and right.
That' s what Virge thinks.
What do you think, Bo?
I' ve been thinking about them other fellas, Cherry.
Well, what I mean is, I like you the way you are...... so what do I care how you got that way?
That' s the sweetest, tenderest thing anyone ever said to me.
It' s hard for a fellow after he' s been turned down...... to get up enough guts to try again.
You don' t need guts, Bo.
- I don' t?
- That' s the last thing you need.
Anyhow, I just don' t have any now.
So I just have to tell you what I feel in my heart.
Yes?
I still wish you was going back to the ranch with me.
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.
I' d go anywhere in the world with you now.
Anywhere at all.
- You would?
- Anywhere at all.
- You would?
- Yes, I would.
- You would!
- I would, I would, I would.
- You would?
- I would.
Yes, I would.
I would.
Virge.
Virge, she....
She' s gonna marry me!
Ain' t it wonderful when somebody so terrible turns out so nice?
Our ranch is gonna be the nicest place in the world!
We' re gonna have an angel on it.
- Here' s your map.
- Here' s your bag.
- This old thing!
- I' il show you the way to Montana.
Captain!
You got yourself another passenger!
- Wait a second.
Come on, we wasted enough time already.
- What you waiting for?
- You hush for a second!
Hear me!
- Bo, I ain' t going.
- You ain' t what?
You don' t need me to look after you.
Fact is, you got someone you gotta look after.
Here' s your wedding ring.
Virge, I wish you' d come.
I liked you long before I ever liked Bo.
- Folks, gotta get rolling.
- The bus can' t wait all day.
You' re my buddy.
I ain' t gonna let you go.
You' re coming with us.
We want you to!
- Bo!
- Let me be.
Let me be.
You can' t do it that way.
You can' t.
lf he don' t wanna come, you can' t make him.
Whatever I got left up there, the boys can have it.
- Goodbye, Bo.
- Come on, Cherry, let' s make it fast.
Why, you' re liable to freeze to death in that skimpy little thing.
But what about you?
You need something.
Bye, everybody.
Bye!
Bye.

Get over here.
Now stop it!
Hello!
ls they dead?
They' d better be, cos I' m gonna bury 'em!
Let' s go.
My brother.
My brother.
He' s dead.
His shoulder and leg is pretty badly broken.
- You a doctor?
- Horse doctor.
But bones is bones.
Also a blacksmith.
Bring brother.
More in the centre.
God, we pass on to you the body and soul of this nameless peckerhead.
At least he went quick, and he ain' t going to suffer scurvy, the dysentery, spotted fever or the cholera not to mention other maladies contracted in consort with low women.
Or waste years digging in the dirt and finding dirt, like I have.
- Talk about him!
- You wanna be next?
And seeing how he survived all that, he could have been hit by timber, fall down a shaft, starved, get murdered or committed suicide on Christmas Eve.
What I mean, God, is you have no pity for your living children, so that' s why we' re asking you to be a little kinder to them when they' re dead.
So, with all due reverence, Lord, we pass on to you this corncracker' s body and soul to take him and to keep him...
I stake this claim for me and my new pardner, whatever his name is...
Forever and ever.
Amen.
Pull him up.

We' re on our way
I still see Elisa
She keeps on returning
As breathless And young as ever
I still hear Elisa
And still feel a yearning
To hold her against me again
Her heart was made of holidays
Her smile was made of dawn
Her laughter was an April song
That echoes on and on
Since I saw Elisa
The shadows are falling
And winter is calling above
But I still see Elisa
Whenever I dream
Of love
- Elisa.
That the name of your girl?
- Yeah.
I found this.
I thought it might make a good crutch now that you seem to be getting around good.
Thanks.
It just don' t seem right, Mr Rumson.
You doing all the work and me getting half.
I mean, it' s your mule, your tools and all.
- It was your brother.
- Well...
Where I come from, we' re cautious of strangers who talk in an easy manner.
You got me down for some kind of low scuff from New Orleans?
Sell you patent medicine with one hand, pinch your purse with the other?
That' s what I was thinking.
Actually, you' re right, but I ain' t yet sunk to horse stealing.
I' ve salted claims, yeah.
And I' ve sold whisky to lnjuns.
Once a man come at me with a gun, and I killed him.
I can' t think of one commandment I ain' t shattered.
I never did fancy my parents, let alone respect or honour them, and I have coveted my neighbour' s wife...
Whenever I had a neighbour and whenever he had a wife.
And I gamble and I cheat at cards, but there is one thing I do not do.
I ain' t never gulled a pardner.
The one sacred thing, even to low scuff like me, is a man' s pardner.
Two pennyweight short of four ounces.
Pass me your pouch, I' il pour your share.
And, Pardner, I' il swap pouches with you anytime you say.
I meant no offence, and I appreciate you saving my life and all.
But what' s expected in return?
That' s right.
I like to know what crops I' m planting.
I expect you to come get me, cos I don' t want to die muddy drunk.
I expect you to be my companion and solace me.
What happens when you get in a fight?
lf four of anything come at me at one time, you might lend a fist.
Up until that, I can take care of myself.
You see, I don' t fight fair.
Well, I don' t fight at all unless I absolutely have to.
I got kind of a temper, and once I start, I just can' t quit.
Well, good.
Just remember that I' m on your side.
I hear a shopkeeper' s pulled into town with a wagon full of whisky.
What do you say I hoist you up that mule and we go get boiled?
I ain' t a boozing man, either.
Well, I am.
Town meeting tonight!
There' s gonna be a town meeting tonight!
Town meeting tonight, Ben.
- Ben!
Ben Rumson!
- Mooney!
This is my pardner.
- I thought you went back to lreland.
- I am.
I' m just passing through.
- It' s right on the way.
- Mooney.
- How' s it going, Willie?
- I ain' t won a hand in three weeks.
This is my pardner.
He calls himself Rotten Luck Willie, but that' s just to get the suckers.
You can' t beat him, so don' t play.
- I don' t gamble.
- Neither does he.
My name' s Ben Rumson.
This here' s my pardner.
And I' m buying whisky for any man that can stand up.
- I was sitting there.
- Now you' re standing there.
Whisky!
Ben Rumson, you have an outstanding account in the amount of $68 from Yuba City, and which you skipped town on me.
Skipped town on you?
I was run out.
Don' t you remember?
I want to be paid now before they run you out of this town.
Put that damn gun down and stand these boys the whisky.
Dry your hands before you weigh it.
We need supplies.
A pound of sugar, half a case of whisky, and pneumonia for Schermerhorn there.
A pound of sugar and a two pound sack of flour, please.
Evening.
Horace Tabor, Worcester, Massachusetts.
When did you get in?
Arrived this morning.
Hit a vein this afternoon, and I aim to be back in Worcester by Christmas.
It says here California' s going to be admitted to the Union.
Just what it needs... law and order.
- That' s good news.
- Well, it ain' t to me.
It' s my policy to bust out of any territory the day it become a state
- and head for the wilderness.
- I don' t agree, sir.
You look around the human race, you wonder what was God thinking.
God made the mountains God made the sky
God made the people God knows why
He fixed up the planet As best as he could
Then in come the people And gum it up good
The first thing ya know
They civilise the foothills And everywhere he put hills
The mountains and valleys below
They come along and take 'em And civilise and make' em
A place where No civilised person would go
The first thing you know The first thing you know
They civilise what' s pretty By puttin 'up a city
Where nothin 'That' s pretty can grow
They muddy up the winter
And civilise it into A place too uncivilised even for snow
The first thing ya know
They civilise left They civilise right
Till nothin 'is left Till nothin' is right
They civilise freedom till no one is free
No one except By coincidence, me
The first thing ya know
The boozer' s in prison And the criminal, he isn' t
And only the rascals have dough
When I see a parson I gotta put my arse in
The wagon that follows the tail of a crow
The first thing ya know I pick up and blow
The first thing you know
Ben Rumson!
You bloody old rumpot!
Mad Jack Duncan!
This is my pardner.
I heard you was in town.
Wait till I tell you what happened to Harry and Ernest and me.
- What?
- We never went home.
We' re having a dance.
Jump in!
Climb on, Pardner.
We' re going to a dance!
Out the window go the beans Out the window go the beans
Out the window go the beans I had a lucky day
Mary, my Mary My sweet canary
We' re goin 'out this evenin'
Mary, my Mary I' m gonna take you out tonight
So hand me down that can o 'beans Hand me down that can o' beans

Good times are here to stay
- Anybody seen Ben Rumson?
- He left here about 20 minutes ago.
- Thanks.
- Are you his pardner?
He owes me $80.
He said you would stand good.
Pardner.
- Can you help me get up on the mule?
- You all right?
I get melancholy every now and then.
It' s a disease common to mountain men who live alone a lot, but if you stay with me such times, I' il be OK.
All right.
Did Ezra Atwell come to you for that $80?
Yeah.
I stood good for you.
I guess this is what you meant, when you said you expected me to come get you muddy drunk in the street.
And now you' re gonna be my companion in my moment of despair.
- Well, you' re my pardner, ain' t you?
- I like you, Pardner.
I like you, Ben.
My mother and father' s dead, and my two brothers and myself, we worked the farm.
Then last year, my older brother, he took himself a wife.
Me and my kid brother decided to leave Michigan and come out here, maybe dig some gold, get enough money to buy some land.
Except now that he' s gone, I don' t have too much appetite for farming.
What about your girl?
- Girl?
- Yeah.
Elisa.
ls she gonna come out and join you, or did she marry your brother?
To tell you the truth, there is no Elisa.
I just read that name somewhere and made it up.
Them' s the best kind, but what I need now is the worst kind.
It' s a living hell up here, what with the bloody rain and the bloody loneliness, and that bloody, bloody wind.
Maria, Maria
They call the wind Maria
Away out here they got a name For rain and wind and fire
The rain is Tess The fire' s Joe
And they call the wind Maria
Maria blows the stars around And sends the clouds a- flyin '
Maria makes the mountains sound
Like folks were up there dyin '
Maria, Maria
They call the wind Maria
Before I knew Maria' s name And heard her wail and whinin '
I had a girl and she had me And the sun was always shinin '
But then one day I left my girl I left her far behind me
And now I' m lost So goldurn lost
Not even God can find me
Maria, Maria
They call the wind Maria
Out here they got a name for rain For wind and fire only
But when you' re lost and all alone There ain' t no word but lonely
And I' m a lost and lonely man Without a star to guide me
Maria, blow my love to me
I need my girl beside me
Maria, Maria
They call the wind Maria
Maria, Maria
Blow my love
To me
Women!
Look at the women!
Look!
Two women!
Look at the two women!
There' s five women!
I wanna get one of them gals!
Women!
Women!
There' s 64 women coming into town!
Men, 80 women coming down the river!
Lady, I got $50 here in gold dust.
You can have it all if you let me hold the baby.
Very well.
No, I don' t want your money for it.
You' il hurt his feelings, Sarah.
Take it.
Look at them eyes, glowing like he just hit pay dirt.
He' s a girl, you bummer!
Would anyone else care to hold the baby?
- Not now, Jacob.
- Just where are you people from?
lilinois, originally.
I' m Jacob Woodling.
- This is my wife Sarah.
- And who is this fine young lady?
- Her name is Elizabeth Woodling.
- Your sister?
No.
My wife.
Your wife?
I thought that one was your wife.
- They both are.
- Holy Moses!
They' re Mormons!
- Du lieber Himmel!
- Nice work, old man!
- Can we get something to eat there?
- With $50, you can, sir.
Follow me.
- What the hell is a Mormons?
- lch weiß nicht.
Bridegroom, I don' t give a damn how a man prays.
There' s room in hell for all of us, but it just ain' t equitable, for you to be having two of something all of us got none of.
So I' il tell you what I' m gonna do.
Your mule' s lame, and I got a beauty that cost me $140.
I' il swap you straight, my mule for one of your wives.
Now, which one' s baby' s mother?
God knows I wouldn' t want to separate mother and child.
- I am.
- Good.
I fancied t' other one, I did.
- This is immoral.
- I hope so!
- The woman' s married.
- No, she' s not!
We don' t recognise plural marriage in California.
Then I bid $250 in gold for her.
- 260!
- 265!
Wait!
You can' t buy a woman for money.
Try and get one without it.
All right, what about it, Mormons?
Jacob, we need every penny, and I can' t bear another day of those martyred looks.
- There it is again.
- This ain' t a martyred look, Sarah.
This look is pure hatred.
Quiet!
Brigham Young has 27 wives, and he hasn' t had half the trouble with them.
Then simplify your life, Jacob.
Sell me.
But, Elizabeth, you don' t know what you' il get.
I know what I' ve had.
- Go ahead, Jacob.
- Gentlemen...
Out here I ain' t a Mormon.
Elizabeth is a headstrong woman, especially since her own baby died two weeks ago, but she' s given her consent to be sold.
Therefore, if any of you want to bid for her, so be it.
But let' s go outside, where there' s room for more people.
Come on!
Come on!
You wait here and feed the baby.
It' s not proper you standing on a block.
lf anyone wants to inspect you I' il send them in.
Order!
Order!
I intend to conduct this auction in an orderly manner!
And no bids in Spanish.
The last bid was $265 and two blankets. $265, two blankets and a jackass!
A two- pound sack of coffee, a two- pound sack of brown sugar...
Holbrook, even if she is bought, how will she marry who bought her?
She' il be married by the prevailing law of this community, which is mining law, and she will be treated like any other legal claim!
Order!
Order!
Order!
Order!
The man bids $275, four blankets, one pickaxe and a bedpan.
Mooney, there' s a woman in the saloon with a baby pressed against her breast.
That' s right.
Wait.
It ain' t every day that we got a woman in Atwell' s
- pressing her breast with her baby.
- That' s right.
Clendennon, there' s a woman in Atwell' s pressing her breast to the saloon.
I know, and we' re bidding for her.
Sam Fletcher bids $300, four blankets...
Ben, where you going?
There' s a breast in Atwell' s pressing a woman against her.
You better stay here.
- Look!
There' s another one!
- He' s a Mormon.
He has two wives.
- I' il kill him.
- They' re bidding on her now.
What' s the bid?
Whatever the bid is, I double it!
$400 was bid last!
Mr Ben Rumson gallantly doubles that bid to $800!
800 once...
I' m his pardner, and he withdraws the bid.
- You have power of attorney?
- Power of what?
Written permission, signed and witnessed.
lf he could do that, he' d talk for himself.
- 800 twice!
- Wake up, Ben.
Come on.
Sold to Mr Ben Rumson for $800!
He only looks that way when he' s drunk.
I think you' il be agreeably surprised.
Get the soap and water
Get the soap and water
Got a sweet perfumer To try his humour
It' s Ben' s weddin 'day
Wash him down and clip him
Wash him down and clip him
He' s got a blue- eyed wonder To put him under
It' s his weddin ', Ben' s weddin' Ben' s weddin 'day
Where am I goin '?
I don' t know
Where am I headin '?
I ain' t certain
All I know is I am on my way
Amen
Dearly beloved, we have gathered together to grant this man, Ben Rumson, exclusive title to this woman, Mrs Elizabeth Woodling, and to all her mineral resources.
I have drawn up this record of claim, which here and henceforth will be recognised as a certificate of marriage.
So I ask you, Ben, do you recognise this claim as a contract of marriage, and do you take this woman to love, honour and cherish?
He does.
Elizabeth Woodling, do you take this man, Ben Rumson, to love, honour, and obey him until death do you part?
She does.
I now pronounce you claimed and filed as Mr and Mrs Ben Rumson.
Mr Rumson went to town Ridin 'on a pony
Bought a wife and brought her home And called it matrimony
Mr Rumson bought a bride Out in Californy
He' d have saved a lot of money Stayin 'drunk and horny
Oh, Susannah He' s happy as can be
For he' s got him somethin 'better Than a banjo on his knee
Rumson, he got married today Married today, married today
Rumson, he got married today What' il he do tomorrow?
I' il be glad to help you work your claim!
I' il be bedding down by the fire if you need me.
You' il not regret taking me in, I' il make you a good wife.
You sure as hell will.
I don' t fault you for taking me for an easy woman.
I was bought and paid for.
But you bought me for a wife, not a whore.
lf you come again at me again like a slavering dog, I' il shoot you!
Watch where you point that thing.
You' d blow my manhood halfway to the moon.
I mean to make you a good wife and honour this contract of marriage, but only if you will honour it as well.
I don' t know what you mean by honour it.
I know your sort of man.
My father was the same sort, born under a wandering star.
I ain' t fool enough to bond you with all the tyrannies of marriage.
All I want is your name, Mr Rumson, and the least measure of respect due to a man' s wife.
But most of all,
I want you to build me a cabin.
A cabin that' il stand up in winter with a fireplace of stone and a door I can bolt if I have to.
And if you do that, I will say you have honoured the contract.
But if you regret having bought me, say so now.
And if I have to work forever, I' il see you get your $800 back.
I admire your pioneer spirit and your straightforward manner.
- ls that what you' ve been admiring?
- I' ve been admiring you.
All right, I' il build you a cabin, and I' il give you my name proudly.
You' re Mrs Ben Rumson, and I' il kill any man that says you ain' t, and I' il stick to it till I move on, which is when the gold pinches out or the first snow of winter.
You ain' t gonna claim duress later just cos I held a gun on you?
No, ma' am, I ain' t going to claim duress.
I seem to lack all sense of shame with you.
These men came all the way from Fiddler' s Camp just to see your wife.
Hiya, Ben!
Looks like I married myself a tourist attraction.
Some of these boys hiked 15 miles.
Ben, how' s married life?
Pardner, it was so good, I forgot that I was married.
I' d hike 15 miles to look at that myself.
I can see it ain' t gonna be easy, married to the only woman in these mountains.
All right, boys!
The lady wants a cabin to live in, a proper cabin made out of wood that' il hold up in the winter!
So just don' t sit there gaping, get to work!
Send back the world There' s too much night for me
The sky is much too high To shelter me when darkness falls
Four cabin walls Would be just right for me
I need a threshold I can cross
Where I can sit And gather moss forevermore
A million miles away
Behind the door
Roll up the plains There' s too much view for me
There' s so much space Between the waiting heart
And whispered word It' s never heard
One room will do for me
Where every evening I can stare at someone
Smiling from his chair Across the floor
A million miles away
Behind the door
Where every evening I can stare at someone
Smiling from his chair Across the floor
A million miles away
Behind the door
No fears, no fools
No lies, no rules
Just doing with my life
What life is for
A million miles away
Behind the door
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth?
- Where have you been?
- Down at the rapids taking a bath.
You mean you was taking a bath?
I mean I was taking a bath.
What do you think I mean?
You was down at the rapids just now, bare beam and buck naked?
I' m not like to take a bath with my clothes on, Mr Rumson.
Are you trying to tell me you was taking a bath?
- That' s right.
I was taking a bath.
- ln the middle of the night?
Mr Rumson, in a community of 400 men, would you rather I took my bath bare beam and buck naked in the middle of the day?
- What' s the matter with you?
- What' s the matter with me?
I ain' t running around in the middle of the night in my drawers.
Hey, boys!
Listen to this.
"The proprietors of the Hares and Hounds Club in Sonora
"wish to announce that six ladies are expected to arrive by stage
"from San Francisco on the 15th of August."
- How about that.
- That' s a hundred miles away.
What good is that gonna do us?
Ain' t no one trying to steal your wife, Ben.
I' il admit there' s a few who wouldn' t mind trying.
Horace Tabor, for instance.
He likes to give her a look.
- Horace Tabor?
- Come on, Ben.
He just looks.
She doesn' t encourage him or anybody else.
But you' re beginning to cut a comical figure.
- Everybody' s laughing at you.
- I would' ve never thought of Tabor.
What the hell are you looking at, Horace Tabor?
I' m looking for my stirring stick.
You make any more advances towards my wife, and I' m gonna shoot you down like the dog you are!
And the rest of you horny gorillas!
You want something to do?
Put up your money for them six French tarts coming into Sonora!
But keep your lusting minds off of my wife!
I' d advise you, Rumson, not to refer to me as a dog again.
- ls that clear?
- I' il stick my fist in your ear!
- Why you...!
- Grab Tabor!
Stop him!
Get back!
Get ahold of him!
Mr Rumson!
- Rumson, I...
- Mr Rumson!
Nobody has behaved unseemly to me.
I have been treated with nothing but kindness in this camp, and you owe every one of these men, especially Mr Tabor, an apology.
By God, you' re right!
I don' t know what' s come over me.
I' ve been behaving like a damn fool, and I wish to beg your communal pardons, especially yours,
Horace Tabor.
I suppose if I was married to the only woman in the neighbourhood, I might be just as demented.
And, Mrs Rumson!
May I extend my compliments?
You are as wise as you are fair.
- Get your hands off!
- That lunatic tried to kill me!
I demand a town meeting to consider a proper course of action.
lf that knife had come one inch lower, I would not be here today.
- That' s right.
- Fellow citizens, as long as that madman prowls among us, no one is safe.
Therefore, we must find a solution by tonight.
Let us not wait until the condition worsens or his aim improves!
- Thank you.
- Order!
- Mr Chairman!
- The chair recognises Ezra Atwell.
I would like to ask Ben Rumson directly if he doesn' t think that with a little sober effort he could control these fits of jealousy?
It' s getting worse every day.
Sorry, I can' t help you.
- The chair recognises Ben' s pardner.
- Thank you, Mr Holbrook.
I' ve been giving it some considerable thought, ever since Ben Rumson, my pardner here, poor bastard...
Excuse me, ma' am...
Well, ever since he became a lunatic.
What' s putting the strain on Ben' s mind is having the only woman for 90 miles around here.
My proposal is that we get some more women for this town.
How you gonna get women to come up here?
- Order!
Order!
- I know where we can get some women.
The six French bawds arriving in Sonora a week Saturday.
You' re right.
Let' s get them to come up here instead.
How? lf I was a French bawd, I' d go to Sonora.
lf you was a French bawd, we' d have no trouble.
How will we get 'em up here?
They gotta take the stage from Sacramento, and change horses at Starbottle' s Pass.
So five of us go down there, hijack that stage, re- route them tarts up here instead.
What' s so hard about that?
It all sounds just fine to me.
- When do we go?!
- Order!
Order!
ls it your proposal, Mr Rumson, that we knock out the stage driver, steal a coach and kidnap six women?
Sounds better every time I hear it.
- You don' t see what' s wrong with it?
- What?
lf you don' t consider assault and battery, grand larceny and kidnapping wrong, what the hell do you consider wrong?
- You maniac!
- Sit down!
- You insane man!
- Schermerhorn, you' re out of order.
- What?
- I yield the floor.
- Proceed, Schermerhorn.
- What?
- Speak!
- You maniac!
You insane man!
What do you think them people in Sonora will do when we hijack their Fräuleins?
They grab their guns and come up here to get them back!
Order, order!
- Gentlemen!
- Mr Atwell has the floor.
Gentlemen, it is 50 miles from here to Starbottle' s without a road or a trail.
Not even my mule can do it, how...
You lunatics!
Besides a civil war with Sonora, you want to put us in the white slave business!
Schermerhorn, you' re out of order!
- Again?
- You haven' t been recognised!
I' m Schermerhorn.
- Mr Holbrook.
- Oh, sit down!
Ben, these boys are right.
Mr Holbrook, I withdraw the proposal.
Have you gone out of your skull?
You can' t expect them to build a two- storey building
- just to get women here.
- Who said two storeys?
Somebody has to run the faro tables.
Rotten Luck Willie will.
You can' t expect him to build a fancy building with chandeliers and masterpieces of art and gambling, and six beautiful tarts upstairs.
We' d have every bummer for miles around coming here to spend his money on women and whisky at Atwell' s and Schermerhorn' s.
You think that' s bad?
Why, it' s terrible!
Just terrible!
You' d turn this camp into a boom town!
We don' t want to do that.
- Soon there' d be another saloon.
- And a bawdy house!
- And another gambling hall!
- And another bawdy house!
- And hotels!
- Property would shoot straight up.
They' d make more money selling old claims than gold.
These men didn' t come out here to forge a nation!
That' s for men with a big dream, with visions of America' s greatness.
I' m warning you, if you want to turn us into a dreary boom town metropolis filled with nothing but millionaires, all you gotta do is put up one little, tiny two- storey cathouse!
I say let' s put it to a vote, and any man opposed is a traitor!
All those in favour of bringing prostitution to this camp, say aye!
Passed!
There' s a shifty side to you that I' m just beginning to appreciate.
- Why can' t I go along with you?
- Who' il take care of Elizabeth?
It' il take three days to get them tarts back here.
You don' t expect me to leave her alone in the middle of this?
Who can I trust if it ain' t you?
You didn' t say being pardners meant wife- guarding.
Well, it just come up.
- Howdy.
- Captain Barnsfeather, Fort Sumter.
- When does the Sonora stage come?
- About four o' clock tomorrow.
Why?
Supplies for the troops.
Unmount!
Come in, Pardner.
- You sure I' m not intruding?
- Come in.
Will Ben really get back in three days?
- Why?
- I' d like to know.
Who you expecting for dinner?
You!
Sit down.
Thanks.
I didn' t know you was expecting me.
I talk to the trees
But they don' t listen to me
I talk to the stars
But they never hear me
The breeze hasn' t time
To stop and hear what I say
I talk to them all
ln vain
But suddenly my words
Reach someone else' s ear
Touch someone else' s heartstrings too
I tell you my dreams
And while you' re listening to me
I suddenly see them Come true
I can see us on an April night
Looking out across a rollin 'farm
Having supper in the candlelight
Walkin 'later arm in arm
Then I' il tell you how I passed the day
Thinking mainly how the night would be
Then I' il try to find the words to say
All the things you mean to me
I tell you my dreams
And while you' re listening to me
I suddenly see them
Come true
They' re coming out of Starbottle' s!
All right!
Fall together!
Put me down, you bloody idiot!
Put me down!
- Down, down, down, down!
- Get in line!
Come on, move!
Captain Barnsfeather, Fort Sumter.
At your service, ladies.
Here to protect you along the way!
We' re gonna have to take this detour.
- A detour through open country?
- The road up ahead ain' t safe.
- lnjuns!
- Ain' t no lnjuns around here!
Get back in the coach, ladies.
- There' s a coach comin 'in!
- Comin 'in!
There' s a coach comin 'in lf you listen, you can hear it
A- clip- cloppin 'over the hill
And the sound that you hear ls as good to your ear
As the call of the wild whippoorwill
There' s a coach comin 'in You can feel it gettin' near
All at once And it bursts into view
And it looks to your eye Like it fell from the sky
Like a coach Full of dreams come true
For it' s bringin 'me Eyes that are moonlight
And it' s carryin 'lips That are wine
# To fall down at your door
So we' re planning our next vacation.
I want Australia, she wants ltaly.
She likes garlic.
All of a sudden, out of nowhere, she says to me: do I need her?
Jesus, Benny.
What kind of a question is that?
Need?
What does it really mean to need somebody?
Benny, fuel line.
Waldo, could you answer that phone?
- Hello.
In a minute.
All right.
Whoa!
I got a fuel line broke.
Joon' s on the phone again.
- I' il call back.
Find out what she wants.
It' s an emergency.
She says you' re runnin 'low on Peanut Butter Super Chunks.
An emergency...
The issue is jelly.
You only like two kinds.
Which is it?
All right.
I know.
Super Crunch.
I' il see you at six, OK?
Bye.
Thanks for waitin ', ma' am.
I' m afraid the best we can do for you is gonna be...
It' s gonna be $750.
If you check around, you' il see that that is a really good deal.
- Yeah?
- That is a really very good deal, ma' am.
A little too good.
Let' s do it.
Come here.
You' re not doing your job!
What is your job, anyway?
To clean this house, but not any more!
- Get out of my sight!
- You wouldn' t dare, Joon!
What is going on here?
Joon?
Mrs Smail, please, let me explain.
Beware, the winds of reason shall blow stern.
- What?
- I' m done, Mr Pearl.
I' m done!
The mule' s turned to glue!
She has sudden outbursts.
She' s simply unmanageable.
Mrs Smail, wait.
Please, let me talk to her.
I can talk to her.
You can' t quit on such short notice.
I' m sorry, sir.
In lreland, we have a sayin '.
"When a boat runs ashore, the sea has spoken."
Come on!
We can' t play three- handed poker.
I' m not leavin 'her alone at night, too.
Shejust paints and reads.
- Yeah, and lights things on fire.
I got a fire extinguisher.
Just bring her.
Don' t forget the Louis Prima record.
Remember, always play for keeps.
All right, all right, all right.
OK.
Joon, dinner!
Spaghetti and salad?
In that order?
What happened between you and Mrs Smail?
She was given to fits of semiprecious metaphors.
She' s a housekeeper, not an English professor.
She moves things.
She said you wandered off.
Did you leave the house alone?
Define "alone".
You know full well what I' m talkin 'about.
I can' t be worried about you knocking another housekeeper into retirement.
A woman deeply and hygienically disturbed.
- Her hair smelled.
- But then it was Mrs Piltz.
Piltz?
The answer' s in the question.
Let' s face it, Benjamin.
Hiring housekeepers is not your forte.
Well, until I do find another housekeeper, you are gonna stick close to the house. understand?
Now have some salad.
By the way, I want you to come with me to my poker game.
- Benny...
You' il have a good time.
Web belt and buckle.
Classical Greek martini shaker.
Six turkey- feather darts.
I' il see you with a Deanna Durbin album.
Come on.
- And I' il raise you with a stethoscope.
- Does it have little plastic earpieces?
- What do you care?
You never win, Mike.
Steering- wheel knob.
Salad Shooter.
'56 Plymouth tyre iron.
- Fold- o.
- You must have a good hand, huh?
No, I' m bluffin '.
Really?
You gotta play to find out.
1 50 feet of coaxial cable.
Show 'em.
Jacks over fours.
- Oh, shit.
I thought he was bluffin '.
Will someone get some air to his brain?
He was bluffing about bluffing.
You' re a real pal, Benny.
You can have my roommate.
Save you from the chore of Smail shopping.
Those places are such drudgery.
Montgomery and Smails, Smails and Roebuck, Smails- R- us...
Joon.
- When did you get a roommate?
- Since last week.
My cousin pounded into town and life' s gone from heaven to hell in seven days.
- Just like the good Lord intended.
- 26 years old, he can' t even read.
Spends all day polishing my plastic forks.
When you say he can' t read, what do you mean?
Like words?
And he keeps me up all night watchin 'stupid old movies.
My work' s starting to suffer.
- You install cable TV.
- Joon, will you please glue your sequins?
Have we an internal sequin issue to deal with, Benjamin?
All right, can we make this the last hand?
Play cards.
Two tickets, tomorrow night' s baseball game.
One Pocket Fisherman.
- Fold.
- Do you ever stay in?
Snorkel mask.
She knows how to rattle the day help.
I think we need to find someone more understanding than Mrs Smail.
Tell me, how are you two getting along? us?
You know, fine.
- Why?
- I' il level with you.
I think it' s time you gave some serious consideration to a group home.
- She already has a home.
- Benny, she' d be with her peers.
She' s already quit the two day centres to prove it.
Look, all we need right now is a new housekeeper.
You' ve been up and down the list.
You might want to consider that there are some people more capable of handling these episodes than you.
I think that you two living together may not be the best thing any more.
I' m her brother, and I' m her only family.
And we' ve done just fine, the two of us, for 1 2 years.
Yes, but her stress level is always a factor in her display of symptoms.
Her agitation should be kept to a minimum.
Sometimes it' s the only option.
Benny, don' t get me wrong.
But a group home would let her develop other relationships.
We don' t know this, but what if she were capable of a job?
They' d encourage her in that direction.
These are very nice places - nurturing, supportive.
I' m not farming her out.
- I have every right.
- Yes, ma' am.
May I see some ID, please?
- Waldo, did you start that brake job yet?
You' ve run out of tapioca.
- She what?
- Oh, and the police will corroborate.
Holy shit.
Listen, Jack, you wanna go to the baseball game tonight?
- Hey, thanks, Benny.
- Box seats.
Joon?
Time for your medicine, Joon.
Good night, Steve.
How' s it goin '?
- I appreciate the deal on the engine.
Is it runnin 'all right?
- Yeah, it' s running great.
- Good.
- So... can I...
Can I make it up to you with some dinner?
Some dinner?
- Are you serious?
Dinner with you.
I can' t.
- I mean, I' d like to...
- It' s OK.
OK.
Stupid.
Stupid.
- 18- 1 5.
- 17- 16.
- 18- 1 5!
- It caught the corner.
- It was not.
- Juniper...
- Benjamin...
We know how to count.
- OK, fine.
17- 16.
- You can' t give me what was mine.
- You' re trying to cheat.
- I' m not.
- You' re cheating.
- Joon, you' re the one who' s cheating.
You' re all trying to cheat me.
You' re trying to cheat.
I spoke to some of the guys on the staff, Benny.
Nobody wants to be a housekeeper.
But I gotta tell you honestly, I don' t think so.
Thanks.
Bye.
OK, Stevie.
What chance do I have with Joon?
If somethin 'bad happened to her, I' d...
A group home is the right thing for her, Benny.
This is definitely for her own good.
Hey, it' s for both your own good.
How much longer can you do this to yourself?
Your life is literally passing you by.
You' re right.
You' re right.
What am I doing with myself?
I spend my life workin 'on cars and takin' care of my sister.
Once she gets settled in, you could actually take a vacation.
I can hold down the fort.
Travel?
- Travel?
- Benny, there' s a whole world out there.
I mean, picture yourself on the open road.
Wind in the hair in the EI Camino.
Highway stretchin 'out...
A lovely motorist, stranded.
Carburettor trouble.
Better investigate.
Yeah, right.
I' m gonna be stoppin 'every 1 5 minutes to call Joon to see how she' s doin'.
Black Sabbath, over there.
- It' s a brush kind of a thing.
Here' s a hat.
- Where' s the batteries?
- You didn' t win batteries.
- Those are mine.
Hey, guys, hurry it up!
Or we' il start without you.
I' ve been known to play a little cards.
Box of 30- aught- 6 cartridges.
Medium- sized, green- haired troll.
Soap- on- a- rope, slightly used.
- Cards?
- Three.
- Cards?
- Two.
And the dealer takes... three.
Pass.
Re- grout my shower.
Blue grout.
I fold.
Shampoo my dog.
Lava lamp.
Paint the exterior of my house.
This is supposed to be reasonable stakes.
That' s a see and a raise.
You follow me?
- You take my cousin off my hands.
Just stop.
- Benny' s gonna strangle you guys.
- Chill out, Thomas.
- Joon, we gotta go.
- Flush!
Full house.
Yes.
Yes!
- Benny, tonight' s your lucky night.
- Mike warned her it was for keeps.
What was for keeps?
I lost.
- A cousin.
Without 'em there' s no order in the universe.
Don' t you give me that crap.
You took advantage.
Of your sick sister.
A heart flush is a perfectly respectable hand.
- Not respectable enough.
- Hey, shut up, Mike.
I am not takin 'this guy home.
Remember the bet I lost last year?
When I had to re- plate your socket set, I didn' t back out.
You can' t bet a human being!
Oh, well, if you' re gonna be a baby about it...
All right, Mike.
You wanna play like that?
I' il take him.
I may not be responsible for what I' m gonna do to him, but I' il take him.
Oh, man.
- What are you doin ', you jerk?
- Somethin 'wrong with your car.
- What did you do with my hubcaps?
- I don' t know.
- I' m Sam.
- So I hear.
I' m Benny.
With an n?
Two of 'em.
- This is Joon.
- With an n?
One.
You' re out of your tree.
It' s not my tree.
I think I need a beer.
Where are you going?
Hey!
You' re goin 'with them.
God bless you.
Hey, pal, we' re tryin 'to work here, if you don' t mind.
Oh, my God!
"I' ve been looking for my boyfriend.
Have you seen him? "
Ruthie, a ghost come back to haunt you?
"Oh, Brad!
Oh, Brad!
Brad, please don' t be dead! "
Oh, Brad, please! "
It' s you, Ruthie Mallenek, co- star of The Prom Queen Mutilator with Dick Beebee.
- You saw that?
- "He was mine!"
"He was mine!"
"No.
You need help! "
"No, Cindy!
No!
No! "
Don' t touch it.
It' s paint.
Yes.
Kirk Douglas.
Van Gogh.
Ear.
All right?
Let' s brush your teeth and hair.
- I can brush my own teeth, Benjamin.
- Fine.
- Hair, too.
- Perfect.
Come on.
Oh.
Oh, Benny.
Hey, Benny.
Thanks for the couch.
Mike made me sleep under the sink.
You' re welcome.
- Good night.
Mentally ill.
- Really?
- Yeah.
But, I mean, don' t worry about it.
Her routine is everything to her.
Oh, and don' t hang around her room while she' s painting.
- She hates that.
- No.
If she runs hot and cold on you, just ignore it.
That' s just the way it works.
Listen, if she starts talkin 'to herself, don' t worry about it, but don' t answer.
OK.
She sometimes hears voices in her head.
That comes with the territory, too.
And... just make sure that nothin '- and, you know, I mean nothin' - happens to her.
OK.
All right.
Having a Boo Radley moment, are we?
- Morning.
This today?
Yeah.
So... what' d you do with the cousin?
The river?
What?
You throw him in the river?
- You took him home?
- Yeah.
- To your house?
- Yeah, to my house.
- What, are you crazy?
Hey, believe me, it' s only temporary.
Hey, maybe he can tell Joon about the group home, huh?
If I' m gonna do this group- home thing, I gotta figure out the best way to tell her.
Where' s Waldo? ls he not here yet?
- No.
I' m gonna have a talk with him.
- No, you' re not.
- Yes, I am.
What' s his phone number?
555- 0944.
Too loud!
Too loud!
What?
Where' s Sam?
I mean, I didn' t kick him out, he just left.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did something happen?
He just left.
It was really loud...
It was really loud.
And I just kept seeing...
He didn' t mean to do it.
Do it?
What?
What did he do?
He cleaned the house.
And you kicked him out for that?
Maybe I should invite him back in.
Before someone sticks a stamp on his head and mails him to Guam.
Some cultures... are defined by their relationship to cheese.
Is that a fact?
He can really cook, can' t he?
Yeah.
Although, for grilled cheese, I might' ve used the wool setting.
That' s what I told him.
Really?
- What did he use?
- Rayon.
Silk would' ve been too soggy.
- Cotton would' ve...
- Would' ve burned it.
Right.
Fortunately he consulted me before giving it steam.
I was against it.
I wish he could be my new Smail.
Good night.
Good night.
You need some help?
"Dear Mom, I' ve departed Mike' s with love and gratitude and am now living with Benny and Joon Pearl, two devoted new friends."
"Benny' s predisposition to hypertense lrish monologists notwithstanding, he has given me a job as a domestic engineer and seems pleased with me so far."
"Love, Sam."
Wow.
I didn' t know I could talk like that.
Tapioca?
Yeah.
- OK.
- Thank you, Ruthie.
You' re welcome, Sam.
Let me know if you need anything, OK?
You don' t like raisins?
- Not really.
- Why?
They used to be... fat and juicy.
They had their lives stolen.
They taste sweet, but really they' re just humiliated grapes.
I can' t say I' m a big supporter of the raisin council.
Did you see those raisins on TV?
The ones that sing and dance and stuff?
- They scare me.
Me, too.
They make them sing and dance so people will eat them.
It' s a shame about raisins.
- Cannibals.
- Yeah.
Do you like avocados?
They' re a fruit, you know.
Ruthie?
Do you got any avocados?
You' re very pretty when you' re off work, Ruthie.
Maybe I should quit my job.
- Where the hell have you two been?
They were with me, running some errands.
How you doin '?
- Hi.
Running errands?
You ran an errand?
I ran an errand.
One with a v and one with a ph.
- Look, look, look!
- Yes.
And she' s staying for dinner, too.
Come on in.
- So why' d you leave?
I wasn' t that good of an actress.
Well, that' s not how Sam tells it.
- He' s ravin 'about you.
- Well, he' s sweeter than he is judgmental.
How long have you known him?
Sam? uh... 72 hours.
- Be serious.
- I am serious.
- Really?
- I' m always serious.
I' m too serious.
D' you ever get to the point in your life where nothin 'makes any sense?
Brad?
This isn' t funny any more.
Can we turn this off?
Can we just turn this off?
No!
You!
Cindy!
Why did you do this?
You' re sick.
You need help.
Let me...
Don' t!
He was mine.
He was mine!
And ifl can' t have him, no one can.
Not even you.
You didn' t have to buy that same dress.
But you are my sister, Cindy.
I' m sorry about Brad.
Itjust happened.
There' il be other boys, other midnight swims, other prom dresses.
No!
No, Cindy!
Try it again.
Ah.
There' s only two reasons a car won' t start: either you' re not gettin 'fuel or you' re not gettin' fire.
You' ve got fire.
I think you' d better let me drive you home.
- Sorry.
- Thanks.
It' s right here.
- Second job, huh?
- Yeah.
Gotta make those ends meet, you know.
This is just how I imagined your place.
Or you wanna...
Oh.
No.
For a minute.
What is this?
- Nice place.
- Pretty nice fish Joon gave you.
Those fish.
I was...
- Nice fish.
- I never had a fish.
Not even as a kid?
No. underprivileged childhood, I guess.
- Yeah.
- You can have one of mine, if you want.
They were a gift.
Like joint custody.
You could take it on the weekends.
What is this?
You' re makin 'me nervous.
- Wanna beer?
- Yeah.
I better not.
I better get goin ', OK?
Yeah.
- OK.
- I' il take a rain check on the beer.
I got the doors.
- Wanna go to dinner?
- Ever been married?
- No.
- Yeah.
Yeah?
Great.
- See ya.
- See you next week.
Thank you.
Benny, would you come inside a moment?
Sure.
- Who' s the new housekeeper?
This... friend just came to stay with us for a while, but...
Joon tells me he' s a man.
Well, you know Joon, how flowery she gets with words.
So she' s lying?
I mean, is it a man or isn' t it?
Yes, technically.
He' s really just a guy, a friend.
Where does this leave the group home?
I take it you haven' t talked to her about it.
No, not yet.
The admission date is less than a week away.
She seems content.
Let' s just leave it at that for now.
Let me know when you want to tell her about it.
I' il let you know.
Bye.
- Hello.
- I want to help.
If you' d like to fill out this application, I' il be right with you.
Not so hard.
You actually have cuticles.
That' s amazing.
What the hell is he doin '?
Mashed potatoes.
So are you and Ruthie considering itemhood?
Are you?
# Benjamin and Ruthjamin, sittin 'in a tree
# K- i- s- s- i- n- g
# First comes love, then comes marriage
- Get outta here! - # Then comes a little baby carriage
I' m just takin 'her out to dinner.
- That' s a good joke.
- Did you like that?
- What time you got?
- It' s eleven.
- On the nose?
- Right exactly.
I don' t think I' ve asked anybody the time before and had it been right on the nose.
That' s weird, isn' t it?
It' s right on the nose.
Do you want to come in for a while?
I' ve got that beer waiting for you.
You know what?
I should probably go.
- OK.
- Listen.
Can I tell you somethin '?
What?
You see, my life is just real... complicated, and...
Gimme a break, Benny.
I just offered you a beer, OK?
No.
Why don' t we pick up Ruthie and get some ice cream?
- Yeah, let' s get her.
- No.
- Why?
- Because she doesn' t want to talk to me.
We should go.
Knock it off.
He' s incredible.
He' s amazing.
- Did you have to go to school for that?
- No, I got thrown out of school for that.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
Why don' t you guys go ahead?
I' m just gonna hang out here for a while.
- Really?
Go ahead.
I' il see you at home, later.
- All right?
- OK.
- That was great.
- No, no, no.
- Thank you.
Bye- bye.
Joon?
What?
I love you.
Me, too.
- Don' t tell Benny.
- OK.
Did you see the way you had everyone in the palm of your hand, huh?
You' ve got this gift and you shouldn' t ignore it.
- You should be doin 'something with it.
- Like what?
I don' t know.
All I know is I looked at you and I said "This guy is somethin 'else."
You' re not some schmo like the rest of us, who do what we do because we have to.
You' re blessed.
- Benny?
- What?
- How sick is she?
- She' s plenty sick.
- Now, I' ve been doin 'some thinkin'.
- Because it seems to me, except for bein 'a little mentally ill, she' s pretty normal.
Do you realise you could be the next Buster Keaton?
I' m tellin 'you, Randy.
You' ve got to see this guy.
- Tell him, Eric.
- He' s funny.
- He' s amazing.
Will you see him?
You never know.
Most of these guys just work locally, but the better ones I can book out of town.
- You book 'em out of town?
Detroit, Boston, sometimes LA.
Really?
Can you see him tonight?
I' d love to see him tonight.
- Hi.
- Is my car ready?
How you doin '?
Come on in.
That all came out wrong.
No, it' s OK.
- No, I really...
- How' s my car?
- It' s runnin 'great.
It' s great.
How much do I owe you?
I' m not gonna charge you for labour.
OK?
Listen, if you' re not doin 'anything later, I just lined up this thing for Sam.
- It' s kinda like an audition.
Maybe his chance to make a living at all this crazy stuff he does.
Who knows?
I don' t know, you know.
So if you' re not doin 'anything later and...
I don' t know, Benny.
I got food to deliver, apartments to rent...
You know?
Thanks.
Bye.
We' il lay out the whole routine right after dinner.
You know what you could start with?
Remember the roll thing in the diner?
Who died and made you Ed McMahon?
What is your problem?
This is his chance to do somethin ', be somebody.
- He is somebody.
- Yeah, I know, but he wants to be more.
You don' t know what he wants.
I know he doesn' t want to be a housekeeper for the rest of his life.
If you' re worried about a new Smail, don' t worry, we' il get a new Smail.
He' s not my Smail.
Housekeeper, whatever.
We have to tell him.
What?
Tell me what?
Benny...
Joon... and... and I... are... you know.
Bullshit.
You...
- Don' t!
- Get the fuck out.
I won him.
Just settle down.
- I love him!
- Yeah?
Well, you are crazy!
I am not crazy.
You see?
I hate you!
Can I get you anything?
Tapioca.
OK.
Anything on it?
Raisins.
OK.
Hi.
How you doin '?
- You' re out late.
Yeah.
Listen.
Do you have any tapioca?
- Jeez, I' ve heard a lot of lines in my life...
It' s...
It' s for Joon.
- Come on in.
- Yeah?
Joon.
OK?
- Yeah.
- Good, good, good.
I' m not.
No, no, I' m not.
All right?
Hold tight.
OK.
Shh.
It' s OK.
It' s OK.
I am not!
Shut up!
No, no.
- Joon, please, come on.
- No, it' s not all in my head.
Sir?
Sir!
Stop the bus, please!
Please stop the bus!
No!
Joon.
You wanna step out?
- Yeah, OK.
Yeah, OK.
- How you doin ', hon?
- You think I don' t know who you are?
I know just who you are!
Leave.
Leave!
Don' t touch me!
Joon?
Joon!
Would you please just tell me her room number?
- Please, just come back in the morning.
- Let me talk to her goddamn doctor!
She doesn' t want any visitors.
Not you or anyone else.
She doesn' t wanna see me?
And she doesn' t want to leave.
Get some sleep.
I promise I' il keep in touch.
I hope you' re happy.
I hope you are happy with what you have done to her.
You just stay the hell away from my sister.
No.
Wanna know why everyone laughs at you, Sam?
You' re a first- class moron.
- You' re scared, Benny.
- I' m what?
You' re scared.
And I know why.
I used to look up to you.
But... now I can' t look at you at all.
- I think Fred Astaire is the way to go.
- Yeah?
- That' s a good choice.
- Who was that woman in Roman...
- Audrey Hepburn.
Sam, thanks a lot.
Have a nice day.
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I hope so.
- Hi, Benny.
- Thomas.
How is she?
Tell me the truth.
- She' s been better, Benny.
- You gotta tell me what room she' s in.
But don' t even think about it, Benny.
It' s a closed ward.
No visitors.
Please.
- Thomas, get us in there to see her.
- It' s impossible, Benny.
- What do you mean, it' s impossible?
Listen, I just need two minutes with her.
Benny, I' il get fired!
I' m beggin 'you, as a friend.
I' d love to help you out, but Garvey' s gonna be in there to check on her soon.
My hands are tied.
My hands are tied!
What room did he say?
335.
Shit.
What are you doin '?
Mommy?
- What are you doin 'here?
- I don' t think you' re supposed to be here.
- Get the door.
- How' d he get past Security?
Hey, watch the door.
Joon.
Look, I know you want to be left alone.
But you do not belong in here.
Now, how would you like to try livin 'in your own apartment?
- An apartment?
- Yeah.
There' s an apartment available in Ruthie' s building.
You' d let me live in an apartment?
That' s up to you.
I' m through makin 'those decisions for you.
Listen, I...
I' m sorry I was such a jerk.
I was dead wrong.
- No, you didn' t.
He' s here.
- He is not.
He got me in here!
- He' s somewhere in the building.
- He is not.
You' d never let me have him.
God.
Why do you hate me so much?
I don' t hate you.
You need me to be sick.
Juniper Pearl' s chart, please.
Thank you.
Hey, wait!
Wait!
I' ve been lookin 'for him.
- Are you sure?
I' il take care of him.
- Sam, you can' t be in here.
- Where' s Joon' s room?
- I' ve gotta see her.
- Come on, come on.
Give me a reason why I shouldn' t have you arrested.
- It' s that one.
- Yeah.
Sam, where you goin '?
Benny, this is exactly what we were trying to avoid.
By now, Joon would be in a caring and controlled environment.
Isn' t it obvious now that you two need some distance?
Why don' t we ask Joon what she wants?
Sam, what are you doin '?
Hey, Sam, come on!
Get down, right now!
I don' t know exactly what I want.
I do know... that I am tired of everyone telling me what to do.
Sam, come on!
Don' t touch that!
Sam, leave that!
I' m beggin 'you!
Joon, we want what' s best for you.
I know that.
Sam, come down now!
You' re gonna get in trouble!
I think I want to try living in my own apartment.
I don' t know.
Sam, stop swinging!
But I' m willing to let you try.
I' il prepare the papers for her release.
Thank you, Dr Garvey.
Sam!
- Ouch!
Ouch!
I know.
Me, too.
I' m gonna check you out, OK?
OK.
Haven' t we tried this before?
Yeah, but my life' s a lot less complicated now.
- Is Joon inside?
- Yeah.
OK.
Popular resistance to a series of unpopular dictators was growing in Nicaragua for over 50 years.
By the spring of 1 979, Nicaraguans from all walks of life joined together in a final attempt to overthrow President Anastasio "Tacho" Somoza.
As the fighting got worse in Central America, journalists throughout the world began to realize this could become a
CHAD, AFRlCA, 1 979
- Can I get a ride?
Hey, Pricey.
You tuna- sucking piece of raw meat, get your ass over here.
Move over.
Sit down here.
- How you doin '?
- Good.
Good to see you.
What the hell you going to Zambeze for?
I thought I' d get some great shots of your head being blown to smithereens.
Smithereens!
- Thought you were with the government.
- I am.
- This is the government.
- These are the rebels.
The fuck they are.
This is a government convoy to Calunda.
This is the Abou Deian revolutionary front.
You' re shittin 'me.
They' d be pissed off if they knew.
This is the dumbest motherfucker I ever signed up for, man.
It don' t even pay shit.
Nicaragua.
That' s the spot.
Cheap shrimp, lotta rays.
It' s real thin in the spook department too.
You dig me?
Price, I don' t what you' re doin ', but you' d better get your ass down here.
Come on, man.
You' re gonna get ripped to shit.
Oates, what the hell is this?
The US government offers that house to any Cuban pilot flying MiGs for the rebels who chooses to defect to America with a Russian jet.
- But that' s bullshit.
- We know that, but they don' t.
They figure the Cubies will go for that pool, so they don' t let them near the jets.
The rebels can' t fly MiGs.
Pricey, that' s the point.
They destroy their own air force.
It' s an old scam, but it' s guaran- fuckin '- teed.
- Who is this?
- Yeah.
The smartest guys in the world.
I guess we found out where the government is.
You can walk to work from here.
What a break.
I guess I' il get goin '.
Be careful.
(Price) I love Africa.
(woman) So this strange war grinds into its seventh year.
From Ndjamena, Chad, this is Claire Sheridan.
No, no, you didn' t hear any music.
It must be the connection.
Goodbye.
Alex, don' t play that goddamn thing when I' m filing.
We' re late.
It' s my party.
We' il be late.
You called it a strange war.
lf you filed that story with me, I would say you were editorialising.
Well, I like to editorialise.
- Are you drunk?
- Drunk?
Only with the memory of making love to you on the plains of Fianga, with the First Liberation Army marching by, and opening fire.
- We freed the proletariat?
- And we freed...
I' m going to the party without you.
I don' t wanna go to this party.
I' m bad at false modesty.
- You' re great at it.
- You' re right, I am.
Alex, you' re gonna make a great anchorman in New York.
Undoubtedly I could win an Emmy as a hostess, but I' m not going with you.
You could operate out of New York.
We could buy a place, burn our suitcases.
I still like suitcases.
I' m tired of memorising the President of the Republic of Maldives.
- You tired of Third- World wars?
- No, I' m tired of Third- World elevators.
Look...
Wait.
Don' t leave me.
I have to, Alex.
Fuck Abou Deia and New York.
I' m goin 'to Nicaragua with you.
- It' s a neat little war and a nice hotel.
Yeah!
All right, I want you to know this is the man that hired me for my first job.
And fired you from your first job.
- And then hired me for my second job.
- And fired you!
Some of you may be asking yourself "What am I doing in this strange war?"
Another chapter in an endless struggle that' s grinding into its seventh year.
But who of us can forget the giant struggle on the plains of Fianga?
The give and take, the lunging, the parrying for position, the jockeying around, knowing full well...
Thank you very much.
Look at this.
Oh, excuse me.
I didn' t know you were in here.
Yes, you did.
You were taking pictures of me all over the room.
Well, you know...
I mean...
- Jeez, you look great.
- Thanks.
Here.
This is for Alex.
That' s lovely, but it' s not the best thing you could give him right now.
- Why not?
- We just split up.
- Who split up from who this time?
- This time?
This time I' m the villain.
I thought it would be cleaner with me in Central America and him in New York.
Did he shout about burning your suitcases?
I don' t own any suitcases.
There' s nothing to burn.
This is a great shot.
Yes, it is.
NlCARAGUA, 1 979 (band playing and singing)
- Hey, Russel.
How are you?
- Hey!
Welcome to Managua.
- Did you have anything to do with that?
Well, I thought of calling your photographs "The Pictures of a Lost War".
The New York editors loved it, since they didn' t know where Chad was.
It kinda legitimised their ignorance.
You got your cover, I got a feature.
A class struggle in three little words.
Nifty, huh?
Nifty, I say.
- I' m Russel Price.
- This is lsela Cruz.
She works at the hotel, also as a translator.
My pleasure.
You guys have a few problems down here, between the "poets"... and the government?
Problems?
Down here it' s called a war.
It started in 1 930, before you were born...
My Spanish is not good.
What did he say?
He said he considers it an honour to be able to photograph our war.
- He' s got a real way with words.
- I can tell.
- You' re a hell of a translator.
- I know.
I' m much in demand around here.
Will you excuse me?
- lf you have any questions, just ask.
- Who' s Rafael?
Depends on who you ask.
Comandante Rafael.
He is either a Marxist dupe of Russia and Cuba or the most popular leader of a democratic revolution.
Take your pick.
Hell of a face.
Would he like to be photographed?
- You would never find him.
- Wanna bet?
You would lose.
He' s never been photographed.
- Congratulations on your elephants.
- Oh, thank you.
So far, Alex, this war has the hell beat out of Africa.
- You' re gonna have a ball.
- (man) Alex!
I need a translator much more than you do right now.
Aren' t you hangin 'in there with Claire?
I' m hangin 'in there, like an interim post- war government waiting for the palace to be overrun by younger men.
Younger men?
Yeah, Russel.
You know, I still only have one major weakness.
- Oh, only one?
- Yeah.
I hold onto things too long.
I' m too loyal.
OK, Alex, listen.
Jody borrowed 100 rials from me in Tehran.
Good rate.
But you gotta pay Eddie in dollars, so I can square it with Chuck.
We got it all worked out - cash.
- You take Nicaraguan?
- No cordobas.
But I' il go double or nothing with you on the whole pile.
November 2nd, 1 963.
Martin Luther King - "I have a dream."
- Diem was assassinated.
- Oh, shit!
How' d you know that?
- Your first cover.
Right.
Thank you.
- I' m sorry.
Sometimes the flash...
- Maybe I can fix it.
(singer) Thank you very much.
Alex, please come here.
- That' s you.
- Not many places where I can still play.
Oh, that' s great.
I like it.
Well, I just got off the boat.
Give me the scoop on Nicaragua.
Well, about 60 years ago, the US marines invaded to protect American business interests.
Put down a small peasant revolt led by a very small man named Augusto Sandino.
I don' t mean the peasant stuff.
I mean the real stuff.
Come on.
Tona and Victoria.
Victoria' s better.
And two... watch out for Miss Panama.
Hot, hot, hot, but don' t touch.
She belongs to Tacho.
El presidente has said that if he catches anybody with her, he will cut off his...
- Pecker?
- Right.
And throw it in Lake Managua.
You' re gonna love this war.
There' s good guys, bad guys, and cheap shrimp.
And Alex singing in the background.
We' ve gotta get alone somewhere.
Jesus, he' s doing that on purpose.
Alex is one of the world' s experts on military strategy, you know.
- Price!
- Regis.
Congratulations on the African snaps.
Hello, Claire.
Haven' t seen you since, uh...
- Three Mile lsland?
- Yes.
Holiday lnn, right?
(Claire) Well, look who walked in.
Before you fall in love, that' s Marcel Jazy, friend of wine, women, and Somoza.
Yeah, I know.
He' s also a businessman in search of a business, who doesn' t try to cover up his connection to Washington.
I like his connection in Nicaragua tonight.
But look at those moves.
Can the ClA light cigarettes like that?
Champagne.
Thought we might make a toast.
Please to stay at your table... and you won' t be hurt.
We don' t want to waste ammunition on someone like you.
- What do you want?
- Shut up!
Come with us.
We won' t hurt you.
We' il trade you for some Nicaraguans who care about their country.
Come on.
Let' s go.
Hold on.
Alex, it' s Charlie from New York.
He says a nightclub bombing isn' t big enough to hold for the world section.
There were bits of body in the piano and the song was "Moonlight in Vermont".
- What' s he got better than that?
- He' s got the Pope in Egypt.
Terrific.
Forget the Pope.
You got the Pope someplace every week.
There' s a big story down here, because it' s the first sign of fighting in Managua.
Get a map, Charlie.
Look up Nicaragua.
You drive to New Orleans and then you turn left.
Oh, like hell I' m editorialising.
Look, it happened in a room full of press and ClA.
How do I know they were ClA?
What do you think?
We' re backing a fascist government.
I know that' s not news, but see if you can find an angle, huh?
Alex, there' s fascist and there' s fascist.
Let' s not use words like that, OK?
No, we don' t have any pictures of Rafael, because nobody knows where he is.
Anybody crazy enough to go and look for him is gonna get his nuts shot off.
Same to you, Charlie.
- What do you want?
- We' ve met, Alex.
Hub Kittle, from Lewitsky and Knupp, New York, public relations.
- I have a client down here.
- Who' s your client?
President Somoza.
Yeah, I know, I know, but there' s an untold story here.
The man has a point of view too, right?
Right.
Price, right?
Russel?
I need to know whether Russian or Cuban- made guns were brought in.
lf the guerillas had help, the war would have ended long ago.
- Claire!
It' s your daughter from Los Angeles.
Hello, darling.
How are you?
Has your grandmother spoiled you silly by now?
She has?
Great.
Yes, I got the letter with the picture of your dress.
You don' t think it' s cut a little too low?
You don' t, huh?
Well, I do.
Gringo.
You' re under arrest.
Periodista.
Here, I got my passport.
You take too many pictures.
Wake up, Priest, son of a whore.
You' re a priest, huh?
A padre?
What are you doing here?
The government accused me of knowing Rafael.
Governments are always wrong, huh?
- Periodista.
I' d like to find Rafael myself.
- Whose side are you on?
- I don' t take sides, I take pictures.
No side?
Go home.
Mr Price.
It was all a misunderstanding.
Your camera.
I' m sorry.
Passport.
Before you go, you will sign some papers.
- What papers?
- Your visitation papers, Mr Price.
You were not arrested.
You just came to visit, in case your embassy asks.
You want your passport back, yes?
- You OK?
- I' m fine.
- How' d you know where to find me?
- Where else?
What happened?
Oh, I was just visiting.
Jazy was there.
I think he had me released.
- Jazy?
Think there' s a story?
- I don' t know.
But I can start looking.
- Looking for what?
- I' m gonna find Rafael.
Now, Russel, we have to be clever with Jazy.
Don' t worry.
I won' t come right out and ask him if he' s a spy or not.
- Are you a spy or aren' t you?
- Spy is such a nonword, Mr Price.
- Nobody is a spy any more.
- Russel prefers pictures to words.
You don' t have to apologise.
You are journalists.
- And you' re a businessman?
- A businessman...
That sounds good.
OK, I' m a businessman.
Why was I arrested and then released?
Who the hell are you?
- No water?
- No, no water.
Marcel, you told me there' d be water in the pool this week.
lf she dove in, I assure you she would not notice.
My darling, the guerillas destroyed the pumping station in Masaya.
We must ration water for now.
Maybe I should go back to Panama?
Maybe you should.
Please.
You were arrested because the Guardia are clowns who specialise in excess.
You were released because I told them to release you.
Thank you.
Those aren' t the normal duties of a businessman.
But they are the normal duties of a spy.
You win, I am a spy.
I feel better.
Now we can relax.
You can turn off your little thing.
Oh, I trust you won' t say anything to hurt me.
Why would we wanna do that?
ln some ways, I am a terrible spy.
I used to be much better at it, but now it seems everyone knows who I am.
I have too many girlfriends.
I like to be photographed.
I talk too much.
I always talk too much.
But my girlfriends like that.
- No matter.
- (woman) Marcel?
- Do you know who she is?
That' s Miss Panama.
Do you know who that is?
Yes, I do.
She' s in love with me.
I' ve got to get some water in the pool.
And once a week I have lunch with President Somoza to discuss security measures against the Sandinista insurgents, and all he wants to talk about is Miss Panama.
He is worried about her.
- He thinks she' s seeing another man?
- He assigned me to find out who he is.
Thank you.
We all know the revolutionaries are going to win.
Don' t we?
You know, I saw this picture on a leaflet in Africa.
You know what they all say about it?
That you' re the genius that created that idea.
It was a lot of people' s idea.
Have you been to León?
- No, we' re going to Masaya.
We understand the rebels have entered the cuartel.
You would love León.
Beautiful light.
- Of course, of course.
Only I have heard that Comandante Rafael was recently in the area.
- Rafael' s near León?
- Well, it' s a rumour.
What do I know?
- She' s lonely.
- Well, we don' t want to keep you.
It' s my job.
Do you think I talk too much?
(Russel) So Rafael' s near León.
Did you dream about Miss Panama last night?
I dreamed about you.
- Did you have a good time?
So did you.
ls that an old war injury flaring up?
- ls that tape recorder on?
- Absolutely.
I was sunning myself on the USS Pueblo when the North Koreans attacked.
I took a bullet in the chest.
But I was lucky.
I had a roll of Ektachrome in my pocket here over my heart...
And the bullet ricocheted over the film and grazed your cheek...
Saved my life.
You heard about it, huh?
- Do you ever dream about me?
- Yeah, once.
How was it?
Fast.
- How fast?
- Real fast.
You mean this fast?
That' s another Rafael sign.
LEÓN PROVlNClAL CAPlTAL
It' s June 10th.
The evacuation of León.
Signs for the FSLN are everywhere.
A woman carries a pig.
(man) Carlos!
Do you want photographs?
Come with us.
- You must help us one more time.
- For León, for Nicaragua.
No, I don' t want to.
- Yes.
Journalists, sí?
Pedro, there' s no time to waste.
When you get back to the States, I want you give this ball to Dennis Martinez,
- from me, sí?
Dennis Martinez, sí?
Enrique is dead.
The Guardia control the church and we need your help.
You come, huh?
Use the back way.
The Guardia have the stairs covered.
Go through the courtyard.
It' s not safe.
Come with me.
Bring out your dead and wounded.
Price, is that you?
- You motherfucker, Price, is that you?
Where are those bastards?
They away?
They' re away.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
It' s not my blood.
- Yeah.
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- What the fuck are you doing here?
Man, my ears are freakin 'out.
You' re lookin 'good.
- How do you like Nicaragua?
- It' s beautiful.
Yeah, there' s a shitload of greasers, though.
- Pricey, I' il see you later, man.
- Yeah, I' m fine.
The kid' s got a hell of an arm.
Sandy Koufax, no?
Koufax was good.
But Dennis Martinez, he is the best.
He' s from Nicaragua.
He pitches major leagues.
- I' d like to find Rafael.
- He was here, but he' s gone.
He' s going to Matagalpa, no?
You control a baseball better than your words.
Rafael cannot be found.
You understand, compañeros?
What' s Rafael doing in Matagalpa?
Just keep your talk to baseball.
You see Dennis Martinez, you tell him that my curve ball is better, that I have a good scroogie.
I like Sandinistas.
And I like Baltimore Orioles.
(Russel) You bastard!
- What are we gonna do about him?
- He' s dead.
(Claire) You can' t believe everything you hear in the news.
I think about you all the time.
I' il try and get back before you graduate.
I love you very, very much.
I' il finish this up back at the hotel, honey.
Bye- bye now.
I know who shot Pedro.
Somebody in the bell tower.
- Why didn' t you tell the guerillas?
- Because I knew they' d kill him.
And I didn' t wanna interfere.
It wasn' t an easy choice.
I think I made the wrong one.
Do you know that you didn' t shoot any pictures after that whole thing was over?
I didn' t, did l?
Oh, Jesus, I picked up the gun.
ls something happening to us?
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, I know.
- How was Matagalpa?
- No bang- bang, Alex.
None at all.
- Did you find anything?
Half the press corps.
Hello?
Claire.
- Alex.
- How you doing?
- How was León?
- Bloody.
Claire, I' m tired of Nicaragua.
- Yeah.
Long enough.
Long enough.
You' re right.
Everybody' s right.
About what?
My cheekbones.
What do you think of 'em?
I like your cheekbones, Alex.
ls there anything the matter?
It' s a face made for television.
You mean you decided to go with the network?
They' re gonna give me ten grand a week to read the news.
I' m gonna be in 60 million homes every night.
When I take a breath, all of America will do so.
When my voice trembles, all of America will tremble.
I' m gonna be a star.
My voice will be more important than who controls Congress.
- You' il become a household name.
I should never have come down here.
I' m sorry, Alex.
I think it' s a lot better this way.
It' s all right.
Don' t worry about me.
I' m speaking in song titles.
- But promise me one thing.
- I' il promise you anything.
No farewell parties.
I don' t wanna make a speech to anyone.
- Russel?
- Russel who?
Him too.
You' re running late, Mr President.
We can schedule this for another time.
Nonsense.
Let them wait.
We are a stunning couple, huh?
My stomach is like a rock.
I' ve been working out.
Yes, we are a stunning couple.
Mr President, you own one fifth of the land in Nicaragua.
You own the port, the airlines, the Mercedes dealership...
ls it a crime to be a car dealer?
Let me show you something.
It' s said that the Guardia operates a torture chamber at Coyotepe.
This is a portrait of my father.
He was very special to me.
Every Sunday morning I drive out to the cemetery and put flowers on his grave.
I think people should know that.
Would you comment on the fall of León to the rebels?
Let' s grow up, huh?
It' s easy to fall in love with the underdog, but there' s an upside and a downside to this thing.
I just wanna remind you all this stuff about a "revolution of poets" is crap.
It' s great PR though, isn' t it, Hub?
So what' s the upside?
Simple, and it could happen.
Our pal.
- Yeah.
- What' s the downside?
- Commies take over the world.
Señor Kittle.
Excuse me, Russel, but the war may be over.
This is a democracy, and I have been freely elected by my people.
- Presidente!
I have to conclude this encounter.
Something happened.
I have many more questions, Mr President...
Did he tell you about his parents and the graveyard?
- Yes, I know about that, but I' d like to...
- Good, good.
- Sí, rápido.
My friends, this gathering was not supposed to be a press conference as much as a get- together.
But I' ve just been handed a piece of news.
Rafael is dead.
He has been killed in an ambush near Matagalpa.
- Mr President!
- How many people killed?
Sorry, my friends.
No questions, please.
A press release is being prepared.
Call Washington.
What do you think?
Tacho makes that speech about every six months.
Maybe he got lucky.
- Hub, is this for real?
- Yeah, sure.
Russel, excuse me, but Miss Panama would like her picture taken with Tacho.
- ln colour?
A little embarrassing, huh?
That' il be fine right there.
How in the hell could Tacho find Rafael?
I have my hands full.
That' s fine right there.
ls Tacho lying again?
They did kill him, didn' t they?
What do I know?
Tacho needs a victory very badly.
He needs to prove to Jimmy Carter that he is still winning.
The death of Rafael is the proof he needs.
Carter doesn' t need proof.
No, no.
He didn' t.
The State Department is getting nervous about what is going on down here.
Pardon my French, but whose fucking side are you on?
- I work for everybody.
- That' s a great job.
I send messages to Jimmy and I tell him that the revolution is a flood which cannot be stopped, but it can be controlled.
Nobody listens to me.
I can' t even get a little water in my pool.
Would you switch sides, please?
For just one more.
That' s very nice, very nice.
Thank you.
I' m gonna find him.
Thank you very much.
MATAGALPA NORTHERN PROVlNCE (gunfire)
- There' s the guy we' re lookin 'for.
- Terrific.
Go one more block.
Oh, shit!
I' m not gonna die in Matagalpa.
Slow down, my Queen.
Why so?
Are you not happy that unwonted joy now fills my breast?
M y prison cell is the open sk y.
I longed so for this!
Oh!
How dear is the delight that now surrounds me!
Know you not that sorrow, sorrow awaits you within those walls?
Look:
France' s sweet shores, tells me to rejoice as in the happy days of my first youth.
Oh cloud!
Lightly drifting in the sk y, you bear my affection, you carry my sighs to the blessed land that once nurtured me.
Ah!
Take me to that land, lift me away from my torments!
Yet the cruel cloud flees too towards the blessed land that once nurtured me.
What sounds!
The stag appears...
- What voices!
I think it is the royal hunt!
The sounds come nearer...
The steeds...
- The Queen!
- Ah!
- The Queen!
- That dreaded name!
The tyrant is wandering through the park.
In the peace of my melancholy rest she will strike me with a new shock.
I cannot find this courage in my breast!
Let her stay, stay upon the beloved throne, and her gaze be far from me, too sorely am I despised; pity for me lies mute in everyone' s heart.
She is coming.
Let us run, run.
Run; my heart cannot bear this.
Her heart cannot bear this, no!
I n the peace of my melancholy rest she will strike me with a new shock.
I cannot find this courage in my breast!
Let her stay, stay upon the beloved throne, and her gaze be far from me, too sorely am I despised; pity for me lies mute in everyone' s heart.
Ah!
D oes joy deceive me?
Leicester, is it you?
You?
He who adores you has come to break your chains.
Shall I finally be free of my prison?
Free?
And yours for ever?
M y troubled heart can scarce believe it.
Elizabeth is coming here, to her royal presence the hunt offers an excuse.
You must appear submissive...
Submissive to her!
Today you must.
Oh heavens!
What must I hear?
Ah, spare me this dreadful sight!
I f you love me, ah!
Stay.
M ust I?
And you must hope.
Prey to cruel pain, oppressed, forsaken, what hope is in my heart?
I am condemned to weep, to sigh for ever; your love alone can quiet my woes.
No:
You must not mistrust; she is greater on her throne...... Her heart was moved by your letter...
- What are you saying?... in her eye I glimpsed...... a tear appearing.
Ah!
I f you listen to me, and trust in me...... you will see that all will change.
I am convinced, convinced of her heart!
Yet often it holds mercy and pity.
Not for her who casts a shadow over her throne!
No, do you think so?
Then I myself, if she be deaf to your prayers shall take my own revenge.
What are you saying?
What can you do?
E xpose yourself to risk for me!
Ah, I would not have this.
I shall take my own revenge.
Ah!
I f ever my heart trembled at the cruel sight of death, do not make me tremble for your life.
All that I wish, all I seek is to see you, true and grateful; for you do I wish that my condition were not so wretched.
Yes, faith, honour binds it; and my heart which loves you swears it.
You will rise up from the misfortune that robs you of all your glory.
And if then I cannot offer you a throne, or the hand of a sovereign then I shall offer you the hand that released you from prison.
D o not open yourself to risk.
I swear that you will rise up from misfortune.
- Ah!
No!
- Yes, faith.
- Ah!
I do not wish - Yes, faith, honour binds it...
Ah!
D o not make me tremble for your life.
Yes, faith and honour bind me.
You will rise up from the misfortune
What place is this?
Fotheringhay.
Oh, Earl!
Where do you see me?
Have no doubt; presently M ary will be led into your presence by wise Talbot.
To what sacrifice do I stoop for you!
D o you see?
Remove the hunters from the adjacent avenues; the people' s path is too busy.
You see, my Queen, how Anglia adores you.
Ah!
You know it demands you to be its head.
Silence.
Ah!
I led you.
The hand that brought her squalor can give her again the happiness of yesterday.
I abhor her!
He recalls only her.
C ome.
Ah!
Leave me.
Take me back to my shelter.
Here she is.
Oh God.
She is still the same, haughty, proud; with her magnificent spirit she fills me with fury; but hush now; she is oppressed by just terror.
On the face of that tyrant I see the mark of her fierce sentence, and dread malice.
M y spirit is oppressed by cruel fear.
Ah!
Receive her.
I would fain flee her.
D o not hold back.
The abyss stands before me.
Too proud is she.
B eaten down by cruel fate she stands wretched before you.
I beg only your forgiveness, be not unrelenting
Ah!
Sister, be satisfied now with the outrages you have inflicted on me!
Alas!
Raise a miserable maiden who counts on your heart.
Pay no heed, I implore you, to her false lips.
No, that station suits you in dust and shame.
Suffering.
Who has made you so cruel to me?
Who?
You yourself; your soul, that haughty soul, vile, iniquitous...
And shall I suffer this?
Shall I?
Go, ask this, oh wretch,
of the betrayed bed of the unavenged ghost of that wretched husband; ask it of your arm, your wicked heart which midst the dalliance of love did plot crimes and betrayal and nought but treachery.
Ah!
Robert!
I can take no more.
Ah!
Have a little faith, I beg you...
Call upon your constancy!... to her false lips.
S ome hope is left yet.
You shall not pay with honour and your life for a pardon granted to you, a favour which our love was oft denied by heaven.
What words in my presence!
You, Robert?
What shall I say?
Where is the charm of love, and that face so fair?
I f all long to praise it for favours as a reward; but on the Stuart' s head eternal shame has fallen again.
- Ah!
Robert!
Hold back!
I can take no more.
What an insult!
Oh wrongful mockery!
What insult!
Tremble, tremble!
I mpure daughter of B oleyn,
can you speak of dishonour?
Obscene, unworthy whore, my shame falls upon you, the soil of England is defiled, vile bastard, by your foot!
Ho, guards!
What words are these?
She rants!
There is no more hope for her!
On your despised head I shall cast infamy.
Drag away the wild creature who has condemned herself!
Ah, reckless one, I lose you, when I sought to save you.
When I came back to you in true faith destiny struck us down.
Yes, be silent, tremble, tremble, all hope now is lost.
Drag her away!
Lead me now to death; I shall challenge my final lot.
One single moment of triumph has repaid all my torment.
They were my two best friends in the whole world.
For five weeks.
It was a total accident we even met.
Me, a bum from Brooklyn using phoney frequent- flyer miles.
Tony Croft was kind of a golden boy from Harvard School of Architecture.
We met Lewis McBride, this long- haired Greenpeace tree- hugger guy.
So the plan was to party till we ran out of cash in Malaysia.
It was a paradise of rum, girls, and good, cheap hash.
I don' t understand a word you' re saying to me.
But this is my least favourite part anyway, the talking stuff.
- Hm.
You do?
Good morning, bro '.
What' s up?
Did you sleep good, you little dreamer?
What did you do that for?
It' s my last day, Lew.
Get up.
We' il go do some stuff.
- Maybe it shouldn' t be your last day.
- Maybe it shouldn' t.
Maybe you should get a haircut.
- Wow!
- You' re up early.
- What kind of party' s this?
- My party.
Your party?
Oh, yeah.
I can hear them.
- Where you boys from?
America?
- Malaysian for, "Do you have money?"
- Yes, we' re from the States.
- You have fun here?
Uh, it could be better.
Listen, I got something special for you.
- Yeah?
What?
- I got special animal potion.
- You want?
- Animal potion?
Number one aphrodisiac.
You want?
It sounds painful.
Thanks.
It' s all right.
- Yeah, I want to see this.
- You want to see.
- Your friend?
You want to see?
- Sure.
Yeah.
- OK.
Follow me.
- I' il tell you what this is about.
Yeah.
All right, this is good.
This is all good.
Lewis, this doesn' t look like the number one pharmacy to me.
Hey, yo!
Brother, yo!
- Special delivery for you.
- Oh, this is good.
Good stuff.
Original.
Very good.
- This is rhino horn, isn' t it?
- Ah, smart man.
Rhino horn good.
American, Japanese like it.
- What are you doing?
Come on.
- You take it.
Listen, listen.
Keep you hard.
Keep you hard.
Good.
Even if this worked...
You listen to me.
If this worked, which it doesn' t, you' re murdering an endangered species.
- They' re not gonna get that.
- Yo, yo!
- I know you' re trying to make a buck...
Ten bucks!
It doesn' t have to get fuckin 'violent.
I' m talking to you.
- You listen!
Hey, man!
Fuck!
What the fuck is up, man?
Get the fuck out of here.
- Fuck you, you little fucker!
OK.
OK.
Stop moving the bike.
You' ve got to balance it.
- Slow it down!
- This is a really steep hill.
- Brake!
Are you all right?
- Are you OK?
Oh, my God.
Holy shit, bro '.
Thanks for the help, guys.
Are you gonna push that back to Penang?
- Let the bike go, brother.
- I' m not gonna leave it.
Lewis, the deposit we put down on that bike is five times its worth.
Why are you pushing the fucking bike?
I' m not gonna leave it.
This is his bread and butter.
- You' re out of your mind.
- Maybe if you helped me out.
- We' d go so much quicker.
- Here, I' il push it.
Here.
Thank you.
- You know what?
Nice shot, Sheriff.
Really.
Oh, that' s great.
- Let' s get home.
Come on.
Friends for life, man.
- You guys gotta give me your addresses.
- Yeah, give me yours.
When I get mine, I' il give you my address, down there in Borneo.
- Where?
Borneo.
You got a girlfriend there, man?
No.
I got the Orang- utan Reintroduction Project.
- The what project?
- This group rescues orang- utans that have been kept as pets, and integrates them back in the wild.
I' m gonna go down and volunteer.
Bro ', if the apes need humans to save them, then they' re fucked.
Pay no attention to him.
He' s always dumping on somebody.
- That' s cool.
- What about you, golden boy?
You can' t wait to put all those things you call buildings up in New York.
Skyscrapers.
No, man, they' il be beautiful.
Touching the clouds.
You guys don' t realise how good you have it right now, right here.
So eager to get on with your charmed lives that you miss what' s happening now.
You know what I mean?
We got mellow hash, right?
We got coconuts filled with rum.
We got beautiful, gracious chicks that like us just cos we' re Yankees and tall.
- Some of us.
- And you' ve got this warm, calm water.
It' s like God' s own bathtub or something, man.
Hey, Lew, are you really gonna stay here and try to save those gorillas?
- Yeah.
- That' s cool, man.
That' s totally cool, Lew.
Totally cool.
You sound, uh, interested.
You wanna join me?
[Lewis]
Can' t change the ticket.
No refund.
Think about it.
- Morning.
- Hey, good morning, man.
- How do you feel?
- Good, good.
So?
Is it civilisation and its discontents or uh... you, me and the monkeys?
I don' t think I' m cut out for that kind of thing, Lew.
That' s for you, man.
To tell you the truth...
I don' t have that kind of stuff in me.
Well, I think you' re wrong about yourself, but...
- Give 'em hell.
- Where are you gonna go?
New York is calling you home.
Martinis, pretty girls, the Yankees.
Or do you want to stay here?
Don' t smoke it all in one bowl.
You keep this.
I got Tony' s.
I wouldn' t take Excedrin out of this country.
- Why did we buy so much hash?
- At those prices we had to.
Yeah?
- See ya, buddy.
Good luck.
- I' m gonna miss you guys.
Bullshit.
You' il find a couple of chimps prettier than both of us.
You fucker.
Take care.
- I' il see you.
- All right.
Safe travels.
Yeah, Gaby, listen.
Yeah.
OK.
You know what?
No, I just, you know, I can' t talk about anything right now.
Listen uh...
No, I' m not interested in discussing this right now.
I got two people in the back of my car.
I' m working.
Gaby, maybe when this shift' s over, I' il call you, we' il grab a bite, OK?
I gotta go.
I gotta go.
Bye.
Yeah, it' s Four, under way.
Can you sling a pick- up at the Stanhope?
Lady named Eastern, asked for you.
Eastern?
Eastern, yeah.
Where' s the drop at?
She didn' t say.
Fuck!
I apologise for the sudden stop, folks, but hopefully you were belted in.
OK.
Here we are.
[man]
Take that.
Pleasure serving you as always, Mr Homer.
- This is Ravitch.
- Hey, it' s Sheriff.
How much is a famous divorce attorney worth to you?
He' s worth squat, brother.
I' m single.
What if he' s out boinking and getting bombed and his wife' s not with him?
- That' s a different story.
- Ravitch, can' t you find another desk?
- I say two bills.
- You' re a cheap son of a bitch.
- Grab a pen.
- I' m sorry.
OK, give it to me.
Thank you.
We headed anywhere in particular?
How about we just drive around the park for a bit?
You got it.
Around the park.
I haven' t driven you before.
I never forget a face.
Do you mind if I smoke in the car?
It' s the only place in town left that you can smoke.
Go ahead.
So who recommended me, Miss Eastern?
- Please call me Beth.
Who recommended me, Beth?
- Lewis McBride.
- Lew?
Did he say to look up old Sheriff when you got to town?
- How did you know where to find me?
- Lewis said you lived in Brooklyn.
- Odds were you' d be in the book.
- Yeah, huh?
And odds were I' d still be stuck in Brooklyn, which obviously I am.
So where is Lew?
Is he in town here?
Sheriff, the day you and Tony left Penang, a man came looking for a bike you guys had rented.
He brought the police.
Only they didn' t find the bike, but they did find 104 grams of hashish, some stashed in the hut, some in the trash.
Jesus Christ.
And Lewis caught hell for that, huh?
Yeah.
He' s spent the last two years in prison.
Jesus Christ.
What a nightmare that must be, huh?
Is he still in prison now?
- For eight more days, yeah.
- I wish I' d have known sooner.
I don' t know if I could have done anything but...
At least he' s getting out in eight days though, huh?
That' s not the case.
Anybody found with more than 100 grams of hashish is considered to be trafficking.
Trafficking?
What is that, like, dealing?
Sheriff, in order for Lewis not to be considered a dealer, you and Tony have to fly back to Penang and accept your share of the responsibility.
And what about me and Tony?
What happens to us?
The deal was that if both of you go back, it' s three years apiece, and if only one of you goes back, it' s six.
It' s three?
It' s six?
Finish that sentence for me please.
You' re talking about three years in prison.
Six years in prison.
Let me make this clear to you.
In Malaysia, dealers get death.
Jesus Christ, for a shitty brick of hash?
- So in eight days from now...
- Lewis McBride is going to hang.
What are you, his lawyer?
I' m his American lawyer, yeah.
So how about we have dinner and talk more about this?
I can' t.
I' m on till 2: 00.
But thank you very much.
- Drinks then?
- At 2: 00?
Don' t you sleep?
- I want to do this more.
Breakfast?
- Can' t.
- Lunch?
- I pulled a day shift.
Let' s have dinner then.
Here.
Say 7: 00?
- Tomorrow at 7: 00.
- Night.
Thanks.
- Excuse me, I' m looking for Tony Croft.
- Yeah, he' s up top.
Thanks.
So if you don' t go back, Tony, Lewis will hang.
Sorry.
You can' t come out of nowhere and tell me the bottom' s dropped out of my life and I' ve got a week to brace for the impact.
I' m sorry, Tony.
That' s exactly what I am doing.
I don' t understand.
How come it took you guys two years to tell me this?
Lewis never mentioned the two of you.
Not when he was convicted two years ago, not when he was sentenced to death.
It was only last week when his final pardon appeal was rejected.
I found a detective, the second he found you, here I am.
You gotta understand, this isn' tjust about me, all right?
Like anybody, I have a lot of responsibilities.
I have a fiancée.
I want to start a family.
Family' s wonderful.
Lewis would like to have kids too.
If you can postpone having yours for a few years, he' il have that chance.
I' m staying at the Stanhope.
Could you call me there tonight?
- All right.
I will.
- Thanks.
Thanks, Tony.
- This is Beth.
- Miss Eastern?
Hi.
It' s Tony Croft.
- Tony, hi.
- Listen.
Kerrie and I talked this over and we want to, um...
Well, first of all I wanna say... this is ridiculous.
There is no way in hell that I' il do the six years.
But if Sheriff agrees to go back...
Um... well, that' s another...
In that case, um... you know, it' d be pretty hard to say no.
What you' ve said has been very clear.
I' m about to have dinner with Sheriff.
I' il call you in the morning.
- All right.
I' il talk to you then.
- Thank you, Tony.
Good night.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Surprised I showed?
- No.
Why?
- Cos I am.
- Eastern party?
- Yeah.
- Right this way.
Thanks.
- Would you care for a cocktail?
- Glass of house red.
- OK.
- I' il have a rum and Coke, please.
Thank you.
Reminds me of Malaysia.
Rum and Coke.
- So have you spoken to Tony?
- Yes, I did.
Tony said he was going to go back.
Yeah?
Tony said he was going to call me when he got back from Penang.
So...
So what are you saying?
I can' t count on Tony' s word?
Just, uh...
I think it' s good Tony says he' s going back.
How come?
- Because I' m...
- Excuse me.
Your drinks.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
Tony' s only going back if you' re going back.
- You didn' t say that.
- I didn' t finish.
OK, please finish then, Beth.
Finish what you were going to say.
I don' t expect you to do this without some sort of compensation.
Both of Lewis' s parents have passed on.
They left a little something.
How does $50, 000 sound? $50, 000?
That sounds fine.
Just fine.
But for each year. $50, 000 a year.
You want me to pay you $150, 000 for assuming what is, in fact, your share of the responsibility?
No, not you.
Lewis' s estate.
I mean, they got the heavy money, right?
You come to New York on what was pretty much a fishing expedition.
You stay on the Park, eat here, not some coffee shop.
All right.
If you promise me right now that you' re going to go back.
You know what' s funny to me?
Really funny?
People like you think you can just buy people like me.
I wouldn' t walk into your shit storm for any price.
Any chance there might have been that I' d go back went bye- bye when you tried to pay me off.
- Menus?
- I' m sorry.
There' s been a mistake.
Because then I would be exploiting you.
Good night.
I' m sorry.
I didn' t mean to insult you.
You insulted yourself.
You made your play.
We' re finished.
I would make any play to save Lewis' s life.
I know you care about that.
Don' t let my nickname fool you.
It' s a bastardisation of my name, Volgecherev.
I keep my mouth shut and my head down.
But I do wish Lewis luck.
But I am persistent.
That' s great.
You' ve only got a few days left.
You' re appealing to emotions I don' t have and morality I can' t afford.
That doesn' t change the fact that a man' s life hangs in the balance.
Good night.
How' re you doin ', man?
What' s up, Sheriff?
How' re you doin ', Tony?
Yep.
Here we are.
- Look, I' m freezing.
My secretary' s out today.
I apologise for the inconvenience.
You' il have to seat yourself.
So this is the office, huh?
Let' s just sort this out without that lawyer breathing down our necks.
- She' s pretty intense, huh?
- No shit, man.
After she ambushed me, I couldn' t eat for two days.
I threw it up.
That' s kind of a dry run for our next three years in Penang Prison.
So you' re gonna do this?
You' re going back?
No.
You don' t give a shit, do you?
- You think I don' t care about Lewis?
- That' s what you' re acting like.
You don' t know the first thing about me.
Fine.
Then how come you' re so ready to slam the door on him?
I know something about guys who have clubs and badges.
I' ve had my ass kicked by those bastards.
It' s not how you think.
Doing something good doesn' t mean there' il be a happy ending.
- You could very easily die over there.
- Yeah.
- You think of that?
- This is the other side of the coin.
If this goes down, God forbid, and Lewis hangs, you don' t think this is gonna be headline news?
Sheriff, this is gonna follow you around the rest of your life.
Whereas the other way we come home heroes and the city throws us a parade?
Tony, you' re a fucking boy scout.
You really are.
Listen to me, OK?
Lewis would have gone back for either of us.
You know that.
That' s why I' il never be mistaken for Lewis McBride.
- Afternoon, Miss Eastern.
- Thank you.
Beth Eastern?
Hi.
I' m MJ Major, a reporter for the New York Examiner.
- You' re a what?
- A reporter.
Really?
And what would you want with me?
Come on, Beth.
I know the hanging' s in less than a week.
Press is exactly what you and the family need for a public outcry.
- The family wants this kept quiet.
- Really?
In this instance, your interests and the interests of the public converge.
- How did you find out about this?
- My sources at the State Department.
There' s a blackout at the State Department.
They sold it as diplomacy.
That' s why you need me, and fast.
I can make this happen fast.
- In 48 hours, Lewis McBride can be...
- No.
Listen to me.
The American kid who graffitied a car?
Because of the media frenzy, they had to cane the kid.
That was a caning.
To show some national backbone.
- This is a hanging.
- I know that.
Some Aussie dope dealer' s mother went on every talk show from Sydney to London.
They hung her son a week early to shut her up.
Excuse me, I' ve got a really big week.
Beth, I can make miracles happen in a week.
Don' t do this.
Don' t do it.
Why...
- What?
Jesus Christ!
I' m sorry.
I' m very sorry.
Just...
Can I have that, please?
- Is he boyish?
- What?
Is he cute?
Is he clean- cut?
- Cos if I put him on the front page...
- Give me some time.
Give me some time, some space, and I' il give you your story.
When?
Soon.
I' m gonna call you, Beth.
What are you doing here?
- I have a tape I want you to watch.
- Yeah?
Jesus Christ, you don' t let up, do you?
- I can' t.
- You know what?
I' m gonna watch this.
Honest to God I am.
But I was actually gonna go get something to eat.
So I' il watch it later.
Are you inviting me to dinner, or are we still mad at each other?
Both.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
It' s a toast to Lewis.
Sweet guy.
Loved his beer.
- Did he?
- He did.
I never knew that about him.
Tell me something else.
- Beer is all I really remember.
- That' s it?
- Yeah.
- Wow.
- Lewis?
Are you kidding me?
- Have you spent a lot of time with him?
- I' ve never had a beer with him.
He is, honestly, Beth, one of the sweetest people I' ve ever met.
You' d have a beggar on the street, and he' d just... he' d touch them somehow, talk to them.
The guy could have an illness, language barrier, whatever it was.
He just could see people, I guess.
Got a big heart.
Yeah.
That' s nice.
What else can you tell me about him?
You are good, aren' t you?
Oh, Sheriff, what do you think about me?
I don' t know.
You seem to think I have all these wiles and stratagems.
I don' t.
I have a man' s life in my hands.
I get that.
But let me ask you a question, Beth.
And ask yourself this honestly.
Would you go back?
I wouldn' t ask you or Tony to do this if I hadn' t already answered the question for myself.
Yeah.
But I guess, you know, I don' t think you could ever honestly answer that unless you were in that situation yourself.
- Hi, Gaby.
- I' m not a piece of dirt you get off on then flush down the john, all right?
He' il fuck you and then sneak out, by the fire escape if he has to.
Unless you' re some whore.
I' m his wife.
What?
Fuck you for not wearing a ring.
That' s my friend Gaby.
Good thing you didn' t give her a social disease.
We' d all be dead.
- Thanks, Frank.
I appreciate it.
- So when did you guys tie the knot?
You know what, Frank?
Get the hell outta here, will you?
- Yeah.
- Well, that was fun.
- That was something.
"I' m his wife." I like that one.
"I' m his wife."
Thanks.
You left this on the table.
- Please watch it.
I will.
Good night.
OK.
OK, Lewis, go ahead.
Hey, guys.
Sheriff.
Tony.
Long time, huh?
I guess if you' re seeing this tape you' ve kind of figured that my vacation plans... changed.
I was set to go off and try and save the orang- utan, do what I can.
Kind of ironic, isn' t it?
Look who' s caged and... they say soon to be extinct.
Um... this little docudrama here was not my idea.
I' m sorry, but, um... the folks at the American Citizen Service have done all they can and now they tell me that you guys are my last chance.
So...
I don' t know if you' re even thinking about coming back.
But if there' s the slightest chance, I will tell you this.
I haven' t been. uh... harmed in any way.
I haven' t been tortured... except by boredom and hunger.
There' s not a whole lot of good stuff to eat.
No burgers for you, Sheriff.
But, uh...
There' s rice.
Plenty of rice.
Your rice needs definitely will be met.
But, um...
If you do...
I already do, just for asking you.
But... at least I won' t feel the fear, and I know that' s not fair.
Um... so that' s why I' m doing this.
[hissing, whirring]
- Hey!
- I' m busy!
- Can' t take you today.
- Yeah, well, I can' t take you either.
Pop, remember that trip I took a couple of years back, to Malaysia?
Yeah, I remember.
Some sleaze was selling frequent- flyer miles, right?
That' s not the point.
The point is this guy is still over there in Penang.
He' s kind of a pal.
But anyway, they' re gonna hang him.
But some of the hash was mine.
I' d have to serve three years in prison, Penang Prison.
But if I don' t go back, they hang this guy.
They don' t hang guys for hashish.
I' m not that naive.
You' re leaving something out.
I' m not leaving anything out, Dad.
That' s the way it is over there.
All right.
So maybe you' re right and I' m wrong.
You still want my advice in this hanging stuff?
- Yeah.
- It feels like an easy call.
If you weren' t wasting your life here, it might be different.
But this pal you' il save, odds are he' s worth more than you.
So my advice, you go, you do the time.
What' s the matter?
You look sick.
You' re my dad.
You' re supposed to beg me not to go back.
It' s just not what I expected to hear, I guess.
Lighten up.
I' m just yanking your crank.
Why put yourself through the agony when you know you' re not going?
I mean, who' s kidding who?
What are we, suckers here?
No, they did what?
They weighed him?
For what?
Jesus.
I have to get the call.
It might be one of the guys.
We' il talk tomorrow?
This... this is Beth.
Beth, hi.
You sound stressed.
This is MJ Major.
Is this a bad time?
No.
No, it' s not a bad time.
Beth, what' s wrong?
How can I help?
You know...
You want to know how you can help?
Just leave me alone, MJ.
Just leave me alone.
I' ve got the resources to a daily paper with worldwide readership.
We are picked up by the International Herald Trib.
We could be doing anything you want.
Photographs, articles, petitions...
A death warrant.
Now, I' ve asked you nicely to stay out of this until after the hearing.
If I don' t get something from you soon, I' il go straight to your two guys.
You don' t know who they are, or you' d already be there.
- I' m hanging up.
Beth, I' m gonna need to hear from you very soon.
You will.
Sheriff.
Well, hi.
I didn' t expect to see you.
Come on in.
Thanks.
How are you doing?
- Couldn' t be better.
- Yeah?
Please give me some good news.
Did you get my message about dinner?
Yeah, I got your message but I can' t make dinner.
The tape.
OK.
- Did you watch it?
- Yeah, I watched the whole thing.
I did a lot of soul- searching last night with this.
And I figure you' ve got to know sooner than later because of everything.
I just wanted to come and let you know where you stand with me.
That' s good.
Where do I stand with you?
He' s halfway to Penang already.
I think he' il probably go back.
You know, I looked inside, deep inside, Beth, to find something, but, uh... it isn' t in me.
Oh, it isn' t... in you.
Do me a favour?
Write that down for me.
Just a few words.
I' d love to give them to Lew before he hangs.
Letter from a pal.
Listen, I... "Searched my soul" was the best part for me.
That' s great.
He' d love to know that you searched your soul before you decided not to go.
Yeah.
They just told me that they weighed Lewis today for the trap doors of the gallows.
- Beth...
- Get out of here.
Get the fuck out of here, Sheriff.
- Sheriff is here.
- What do you say?
How' re you doing?
- I thought you had plans.
- I did.
A thing at Lincoln Center.
You know what I mean?
Ready to discuss.
What did I order?
Sheriff, this is Kerrie, my fiancée.
Kerrie, John Volgecherev.
Kerrie, nice to meet you.
You' re not as platinum as I expected you to be.
Listen, Sheriff...
It' s pretty obvious that you have no intention of going back, right?
Where?
- Is he drunk?
- Oh, you mean, like, back to prison.
Right, well, I' ve never actually been.
Do you have a fork I could use?
I' ve never been to prison, thus, I can' t go back to somewhere I' ve never been.
Thank you.
That is brilliantly unhelpful.
- Yes.
- Beth, I checked.
Penang Prison is at a third- world level of sanitation, nutrition, rice rations don' t meet minimum...
Lewis is provided with food from Amnesty International.
So would Tony be.
- Inmates have been tortured.
- He hasn' t been.
- Inmates have died of typhus.
- Because of overcrowding.
Lewis has his own cell, as would Tony, and Sheriff if he goes back.
That' s really good.
And the other thing I think you' ve overlooked is that that building' s not up to code.
- Oh, Jesus.
- What are you, the class clown?
And who are you to tell them to give up their freedom?
I represent a boy sentenced to death.
Right.
For the sake of some client, you demand...
No, no, no.
I don' t demand.
I have not demanded anything.... that they endure three or six years of God knows what.
That' s insane.
Yeah, it' s insane, OK?
- I' m gonna go back.
- What?
OK?
I' m sorry, honey.
In the middle of this, what matters?
That Lewis doesn' t die.
Somebody' s got to do something.
Please.
Where' s the document that guarantees this deal?
The Attorney General of Malaysia has agreed...
So where is it?
Why don' t we have a copy?
- It' s an oral agreement.
- No.
Tony goes nowhere till we have that document.
They don' t work that way.
I wish they did.
I cannot get anything to you in writing.
I' il be at home if you want me.
Sorry, Tony.
I' m sorry.
She' s just scared, all right?
She' s more scared than I am.
You' re gonna have to excuse me.
If I' m gonna get her to wait three years for me...
I shouldn' t keep her waiting tonight.
Tony, what can I say?
Thank you.
Sure.
All right, Tony.
- See you, man.
- See you later.
Good luck with that.
Right, Sheriff.
I' il go talk to the firm.
Well, quite a party.
- Are you gonna go back to your hotel?
- Oh, yes.
Give them the good news.
So I guess Lew' s gonna be OK then, huh?
Which means, you know...
You' re off the hook?
- I' m off the hook, huh?
- Good night.
Jaffe, I want a follow- up on the Canarsie fire.
- Nice of you to join us, Ravitch.
- It' s my pleasure.
I' d like some pictures of the shopkeeper, burnt out.
You got it.
MJ, where' s my pension fund fraud?
I thought you had a CPA who was ready to talk.
I did.
And she' s given me gold.
I' m just fact- checking a few points.
And I' m looking for a source called Sheriff.
Ring anybody' s bell?
Sheriff?
[editor]
Let' s go, then.
- [Sheriff]
Yeah?
It' s Beth.
I talked to the garage and they said you called in sick.
- Can I come up and see you?
- Uh... sure.
- Hi.
- Hi there.
- Hi there.
- I brought some goodies from Zabar' s.
Jewish penicillin.
Cure you right up.
Isn' t that nice?
Should I beware of lawyers bearing gifts?
Think I' m gonna have a beer.
Do you want one?
Uh... beer?
Sure.
You' re quite the avid reader, aren' t you?
- Or is this just...
- Yeah, just for showing off.
I keep my place real impressive, don' t I?
It' s nice.
The books are a recent development.
When I was in school, I tried to avoid reading.
Then I graduate and realise I don' t know shit.
- Yeah.
Who does?
- You know what I mean?
So anyway, I start getting the books and... do some reading, learn about the world around me.
Just trying to be civilised I guess, Beth.
That' s good.
Lewis said you were better than you thought you were.
That kind of thing.
Where' s your passport?
- What?
- I just want to see your passport.
I can renew it tomorrow on an emergency basis if you decide something different.
So when you said about me being off the hook, you were just lying to my face?
I think you were lying to yourself.
Come on, Sheriff.
Only a total bastard would let Tony go back alone.
Yeah, well, I' m not in charge of Tony.
- I' m not his dad.
- I know that.
Tony' s a great guy.
But he' s got a future and a sexy fiancée.
Yeah.
Six years under any circumstances would be hard as hell, but this case, it' s inconceivable.
I think Tony' s a man of his word.
Tony called me three days ago and told me that he couldn' t do six years.
I applaud his idealism.
I can' t count on it.
I have to have you on that plane, Sheriff.
Please show me your passport.
No that it' s any of your business, but my passport' s good.
- It is?
Show it to me.
- Take my word for it.
Show it to me.
You' d take three years from me but you wouldn' t take my word?
OK.
All right.
I pushed it.
I' m sorry.
I trust you.
You know what?
Come on.
You' re gonna go for me if you don' t have a client?
What?
You offer me money and I don' t take that so you figure, "Why don' t I fuck the guy cos then he' il do what I want."
That' s exactly me.
That' s actually exactly me.
I' il get you to go back because I' il give you a little sex.
That' s me.
- Go fuck yourself.
- Whoo!
That' s fun.
I' m the guy who' s gotta clean up.
That' s fun.
- [man]
Shut up!
You' re too noisy!
You fucking crazy bastard!
Shut up!
You' re making too much goddamn noise!
Open the door!
Open the door, you fucking pussy!
Open the fucking door!
- Open your fucking door!
Sheriff, that' s enough!
I' m calling the cops.
Sheriff.
Turnabout' s fair game, huh?
Now that you' re news, all' s fair.
You son of a bitch!
Taking pictures of me?
- I' il bust your fucking face open!
- I' m doing my job, man.
I' m doing my job!
- Get the fuck outta my face.
I' il sue your ass.
Sheriff, can I talk to you for one second?
Please?
- Is that your photographer?
- Is that Sheriff?
Are you gonna print pictures now?
This story is about to blow wide open, OK?
I found this story first, I' m gonna print it first, period.
Your story could cost Lewis' s life.
Do you understand that?
You give me three days - three days - until the hearing is over, OK?
You promise me that you will not talk to a soul and that I have Lewis exclusively.
Exclusive.
You promise me you' re gonna hold off on the story.
Three days, Beth.
Slow down, driver.
You' re making me nervous.
I' m sorry, sir.
It' s a bad habit I got.
I was all mellowed out but you fucked that up.
I hope you' re not gonna say I can' t smoke.
It' s the only place left in town you can smoke.
What the fuck are you doing?
Smoking crack?
Crack is for our African- American brethren.
This is pure rock cocaine.
If you don' t like it, driver, you can raise the partition.
- I can?
- Whatever you want to do.
You want to see what I want to do?
Cocksucker.
What do you want?
I want to see you.
OK.
What' s happening here, Beth?
You tell me, Sheriff.
I' m not sure but I know that I just...
I can' t take this any more.
So don' t take it.
What do you want?
Oh, my God.
You' re killing me, Beth.
I' m killing you?
You' re killing me.
Sheriff?
Oh, shit.
Sheriff, are you there?
I was just gonna say that I hope that, um... you don' t think last night was about...
Um... could you call me when you get this message?
That' d be good.
All right.
Can I sit next to you on the plane?
Hi, Tony.
Tony?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I' m fine.
- Sure?
Do you want to switch with us?
- Yeah, do you want to switch seats?
It' s fine.
Sheriff, I' m a big boy.
I don' t need somebody to hold my hand.
- OK.
- All right.
At least until we get over the Philippines.
Come on, move it, man!
Let' s go!
- Look out!
Maybe we should all wash up, meet in a half hour or so.
Fine with me.
- Is that cool with everyone?
- Yeah, it' s fine.
- I' m right here.
- All right, man.
Hi.
Sheriff...
What' s the matter?
What' s wrong?
What?
I' m gonna miss you.
I' m gonna miss you.
They won' t bend.
Only one visitor allowed in there.
- One at a time?
- No, only one today.
- Oh, great.
- What do you want to do?
Do you mind if I go back there and see him?
- No.
No, you go.
- Are you sure?
Go ahead.
- Tell him I' il see him soon.
- OK.
Can you come back here?
- I hear you.
- Sheriff?
- Yeah.
Didn' t they tell you I was coming?
I was praying.
I thought you were a dream cos no prayer of mine' s ever been answered here before.
Yeah?
I' il tell you that.
It' s good to see you.
- It' s good to see you.
You too!
- How are you, man?
- I' m better now.
That' s good.
- How are you?
- I' m all right, man.
- You look good.
Nice.
- Spiff on.
Are you thirsty?
Do you want some tea?
- I can make some tea.
Yeah.
Let' s have some tea.
- It' s not warm or anything but...
- It' s OK.
- You' re not cold, are you?
- Nah, I' m not cold.
No?
Tony is here to see you too.
He' s outside.
- You see, they took away my blanket.
- Why did they take your blanket away?
Cos they were scared that I was gonna tear it into strips to hang myself.
I said, "Hey, guys, what do you think I' m paying you for?"
Thank you, man.
That' s good tea.
I know why Tony didn' t come in here.
I know.
Cos there' s no God in here.
They only let one visitor in at a time.
That' s why I pray now, Sheriff.
Cos...
Out there there' s no need to... to pray where- where- where God' s hand is felt.
You know?
Where God is apparent?
But in here there' s definitely a need to- to pray, t- t- t- to beg, to plead, to sing for... for a sign like...
You know how... how your voice sounds so pretty in the shower?
Because... because there' s nothing else there.
Because it echoes off the walls and it sounds so pretty.
That' s why prayer sounds so perfect in here.
Because it' s so...
Because it' s so totally empty.
Because it' s so... it' s so godless.
It' s so void of... of anything.
And do you know how I know, Sheriff?
Do you know how I know?
I ask myself... would I come back for you?
And the only answer is a godless empty evil "No."
I' m sorry I wouldn' t have come back!
- I' m sorry.
It' s OK.
Because I didn' t come back just for you.
I didn' t come back just for you, you know?
It' s all right.
Man, it' s OK.
Do you know what I mean?
Come here.
- It' s OK.
- OK, man.
- OK.
All right?
Thanks for the tea.
I liked that.
See you in a couple of hours.
It' il be good.
Sheriff.
Yeah?
I knew you' d come back.
Even if you didn' t.
Thank you.
[Tony]
I don' t know.
I don' t know how bad it was.
It was not good.
What wasn' t good, the prison or Lewis?
The prison sucks, for sure.
It' s dirty, it' s scary, it' s third- world.
How' s Lewis?
Is he sick?
Is he all there mentally?
Is he the same guy we used to know?
I don' t think he' s lost his mind, but it' s not easy sitting around a cell waiting to hang.
[Tony]
What did he say?
Did he tell you anything?
He just babbled a little bit, Tone.
You know, like, rambled a little bit, you know?
Like stream- of- consciousness stuff.
God' s not in here.
There' s no God in here.
The sound' s beautiful, like singing in the shower.
Basically you' re saying he lost it.
He' s hanging onto anything he possibly can.
- No one' s questioning his courage.
- But his sanity?
Find one.
But Lewis has always talked that way.
What do you mean, always?
You' re only his lawyer.
You' ve known him for two years.
24 years.
- I' m his sister.
- What?
He' s my baby brother.
Why didn' t you tell me?
I thought you wouldn' t trust me, Sheriff.
I thought you' d think I' d do anything, that I' d say... say anything, that I' d sell you out, that I' d...
I wanted to...
I tried to tell you.
But you didn' t tell me.
But you didn' t tell me.
Sheriff?
What are we still doing here?
I wish it was that simple, Tony.
I think it' s that simple.
I came back here based on what she told me, OK, and she gave me her word and she lied.
How are we going to trust her, Sheriff?
She drags us into this nightmare, we find out it is her personal nightmare.
I don' t know her.
You don' t know her.
- What?
- I know her.
Like, know her.
Don' t.
Fuck.
All right, I' m an asshole.
No, Tony.
This time I' m the fucking asshole.
Why didn' t you tell me?
What do I owe you to tell you that?
It' s not like it' s been going on forever.
- It happened.
- Listen to me...
Don' t make it like I' m holding out on you because I swear to God I' m not.
All right.
Listen to me, Sheriff.
This girl will do anything to get you to do what she needs you to, all right?
Her blood.
She' il lie to you, she' il sleep with you, she' il tell you she loves you.
She' il get down on her knees and beg you.
But don' t believe it.
It' s a setup.
If we walk out of here, that boy hangs.
And if we stay maybe we hang.
But if we leave, we live.
That' s the one thing I know for sure right now.
He doesn' t have clothes?
Can' t you give him a shower before he turns up in court?
OK.
Listen.
I...
What can I do for you, sir?
We need two seats on any flight to New York, as fast as possible.
What, Sheriff?
What is it?
I trashed that bike, Tony.
So fucking what?
Get on the plane, Sheriff.
Do you want to rot in one of these prisons?
- I' m gonna take my chances, Tony.
- You don' t have any chances, Sheriff.
Don' t leave your life to fate.
This is stupid.
I don' t know, Tony.
You have a safe flight.
- What' s he saying?
- He says they returned but became frightened and may have left.
We request adjournment till the two can be found.
Um... he' s worried about the appearance of preferential treatment.
Hey, Lew.
How are you?
My faith in humanity is half restored.
In returning voluntarily, you are to be commended for your courage.
Is there anything you wish to say to this court, Mr Volgecherev?
Not really, Your Honour.
Just that we were young and stupid, I guess.
But not evil.
I didn' t come back here today because I' m courageous.
I came back here because I' ve been careless for a very long time, and I' m sick of that feeling.
The simple fact, Your Honour, is that I am responsible.
And I' m also scared.
But I am willing to do whatever is necessary... in order for you to spare my friend' s life.
How do you plead?
I' m guilty.
You will be detained in Penang Prison to await sentence.
He asked the prosecutor if he will now reduce the charges.
The prosecutor has agreed.
Chief Justice will be back shortly with his decision.
Beth?
We' re back in session.
- We' re back?
- Yeah.
The Deputy Home Minister is angered about some international news story.
I' m not sure what.
A story that was picked up by the Asian International Tribune.
"In a country proud of its many species of exotic butterflies, a butterfly is about to be broken on a wheel."
"The wheel is Malaysian justice, a term which strikes one American woman as a cruel joke."
- Your Honour...
- "The woman is Beth McBride..."
- I didn' t do this. - "... whose brother was arrested two years ago in Penang."
"Blamed for having bought hashish with two friends, this nature- loving young man now, incredibly, faces death."
- She was determined to write the story.
Silence!
We know you westerners don' t understand our attitude toward drugs.
But we don' t understand yours.
Your cities are decaying, the souls of your young people are stolen from you.
Our laws may seem harsh but our streets remain safe and our youth is protected.
So when an American journalist criticises ourjudicial system...
- Your Honour, I begged her not to.
- Silence!
Lewis McBride... [continues in Malay]
What is he saying?
What is he saying?
He will not amend the charge now.
Lewis must be hanged tomorrow.
What?
Lewis!
Your Honour, I came back here.
You can' t hang him!
- You hang on, Lewis!
- Beth, I love you!
Get your fucking hands off me.
What is the matter with you people?
What is the matter with you people?
You are gonna go straight to hell, you motherfucker!
You lying son of a bitch!
Goddamn it!
Sheriff!
I don' t wanna die!
No!
You fucking bastards!
I don' t wanna die!
Help!
Please let go of me!
You fucking bastards!
No!
No!
Lewis!
Lewis, goddamn it!
Look up here!
- Sheriff!
- I' m here, Lewis!
I' m right here!
You' re not alone, Lewis!
Look at me, Lewis!
You' re not alone, Lewis.
Look at me.
You' re not alone.
I' m here.
Look at me.
See me, Lewis.
You' re not alone.
I' m right here.
I' m right here, Lewis.
I see you, Lewis.
I' m right here.
Lewis, you are not alone right now.
I' m right here.
You are not alone, Lewis.
I see you.
I see you, Lewis.
I' m here.
You' re not alone.
You are not alone, Lewis!
Right.
OK.
- Where am I going here?
Beth.
- Were you there?
- Yeah.
He wasn' t afraid, Beth.
He walked right past me.
And then I saw him go past all the guards and he was calm.
Come on, Sheriff.
Tell me the truth.
It was hard.
It was hard.
But, uh...
You know, I think that, uh... he found, at the end, Beth, at the end...
I mean, he was Lewis, you know?
I swear to God, he was at peace with everything.
He was.
I just wish I could have done something.
Fight harder.
You did everything you could.
Nobody could have done more.
You' ve gotta believe that.
Nobody did more than you did.
Nobody could have done more.
- You did everything you could.
- You should have gone back with Tony.
Why didn' t you go back with Tony?
I couldn' t go back with Tony.
I couldn' t go back because I knew that you were waiting for me.
And I' m not sorry, Beth.
I' m not sorry right now.
I' m not.
I don' t think I' d be able to look at you ever again.
And that' d be a lot harder than this shit.
You know what I mean?
I like to look at you.
I like to look at you.
I like to look at you.
The ambassador heard through back channels that when all this publicity dies down, they' re gonna let you go, Sheriff.
They' re gonna do it quietly to save face, but it' s gonna be six months, maximum.
Sheriff?
Yeah.
Oh, goddamn it!
Sheriff.
I am gonna take my brother home... and I' m coming right back here.
And I will not leave Penang until you' re with me.
I know, Beth.
I know.
The legend tells us that at one time, the empire offered its most beautiful girls to the Python- God in return for prosperity,,,
But, where today does our story unfold?
In which epoch?
Jean Cocteau said;
"Legends have the privilege of being ageless,"
So, it is as you please,
I salute you, people of Koumbi.
I salute your suffering, your poverty.
I salute you all.
I am grateful to you all.
I salute Kaya Maghan and his people.
Woman!
The night belongs to spirits, the day belongs to doings.
Listen!
Hear you not the thunderbolt?
See you not the whirlwind?
Trapped!
Koumbi, you are trapped!
Kaya Maghan, leader of the universe!
They say your empire is boundless, stretching from east to west, from earth to sky.
But I, Kerfa, am not impressed.
I fear nothing!
Misery!
Misery!
He who sows misery, reaps but penury!
Misery!
Misery!
He who sows misery, reaps but penury!
Kaya Maghan, your reign is eternal?
False!
Most false!
I say it loud and clear.
And I say it once again!
Let go of me!
See?
They fear my tongue yet they break my nose!
See the blood?
Look!
Look!
Kerfa, you are unreasonable.
What have you been saying?
Beware of those people.
The vulture does not sing.
The hyena does not dance.
People of Koumbi, wake up!
Sleep does not rule this world!
Goats who would be free!
Orphaned ewes!
Hide yourselves!
Stay away!
Be gone!
The cruel feast of Kaya Maghan begins!
Our customs are fundamental.
Most true.
Their root is memory.
Their fruit is the given word.
Welcome, honourable priests.
So the big day has come!
Indeed.
The oracles have spoken...
They have named Sia Yatabere.
She is the most beautiful, the most noble, and a virgin.
Deliver Sia to the Python- God' s lair.
There, we shall offer her up.
Now you shall speak.
Kaya Maghan, it is for us to speak.
Let that which has been said, be done.
Kaya Maghan hereby offers to Sia' s parents their daughter' s weight in gold.
Honourable, priests, beseech the Python- God to give us prosperity at last.
May he grant us long life, and to our children and grandchildren.
Forgive me.
But Sia Yatabere is not free of engagements.
She is the fiancée of my nephew Mamadi.
He is at the front, leading our armies.
How can we offer up Sia without telling him?
It would be best to choose another girl for the rite.
The oracles have chosen Sia, it is not up to us.
I shall summon Mamadi so he can bid his farewells.
He must not come!
A soldier does not leave the front for his fiancée!
What has been given may not be taken back.
We cannot rob Mamadi of his betrothed.
Rob...
We are robbing nothing!
We are acting for the good of all!
Kaya Maghan, the head of your armies has blasphemed.
He must repent.
Out of the question.
I have not blasphemed.
I have spoken the truth.
What has been given may not be taken back.
- He is procrastinating.
Enough!
What has been said shall be done.
Wakhane, you are right.
But you spoke more as an uncle than as the head of my armies.
Mamadi shall be informed after the sacrifice.
What is it?
Nothing serious.
Then speak.
The priests came to see us...
We know.
Indeed...
They brought news to the palace.
Honour has come knocking on your door.
Balla, what do you mean?
Sia Yatabere, has been chosen...
Your daughter.
Balla, this news is overwhelming.
But tell our venerated emperor, if the country' s survival depends upon the sacrifice of my daughter, then so be it, may custom be respected.
Nobility is not given to everyone.
Of the Yatabere nobles, you are a thoroughbred,
Yatabere.
In your daughter' s stead the emperor gives you the equivalent of her weight in gold.
We will come for her.
Yatabere.
Fatou, dry your tears.
Our pain is great, but we must save our honour.
What?
My daughter is to die and I must hold my tongue!
That beats everything!
You too will die...
Death spares no one.
We all die one day.
But Sia' s death is honourable.
Sia!
Sia, where are you going?
Do not flee.
Wait, listen to me.
Sia, my daughter...
Hey man, it seems that last night
Sia ran away.
It' s great!
I hope she holds out.
For the good of all, we must find her.
Stop blaspheming, it' s not good.
What?
Blaspheming?
Who' s fucking blaspheming?
A girl is to be murdered and you talk of blasphemy!
Mind your language, okay?
You' re taking risks...
Wakhane has ears all over the place.
I don' t want any trouble!
Let Wakhane do what he likes with me.
I' il not sanction heinous crimes!
Never!
Never ever!
Good day, noble folk!
Yatabere, we have come to fetch Sia.
Yatabere!
Worthy son of nobility!
We have come for Sia.
Sorry, but Sia fled in the night.
What?
Fled?
That' s impossible!
Where has she gone?
We looked for her, without success.
Search every room!
If she' s vanished, sparks will fly for you and for me.
But much more for you.
- Well?
- She' s not there.
Not anywhere.
Nowhere to be found.
We' il be back.
Find her!
- Where' s your friend Sia?
- I' ve no idea!
Let go of my daughter, she knows nothing!
Take her away.
She' s in cahoots!
Where is Sia?
Grandmother, where is she?
Search the house.
- No sign.
- Let' s go.
Misery!
Misery!
He who sows misery, reaps but penury!
What do you intend to do, Wakhane?
What shall you do?
Will you too pursue and deliver up Sia?
I am the head of the armies.
I have already told you, interests of State come before those of family.
Do you understand?
We have sought Sia in vain.
No trace of her in the town.
What?
You dare say that to my face?
Bunch of good- for- nothings!
I want Sia here within the hour.
She' s hiding in the town.
Arrest her parents immediately and all possible accomplices.
Away with you!
The emperor has announced that all accomplices of Sia shall be severely punished!
People of Koumbi!
Be reasonable!
Error is only human, but to persist in it, is diabolical!
People of Koumbi...
Python- God!
God who devours his children!
His most beautiful daughters!
Python most misshapen!
Deep in your stinking cave what do you know of beauty?
Be gone!
All our daughters are beautiful!
In fact, all is beautiful in Wagadu!
The earth, the sky, the sun, the stars, the water, even the wind!
Did you hear?
Break the skull of that blasphemer!
We have orders not to touch him.
Do not fear death!
Death spares no one,
If you are afraid, you will die,
Even if unafraid, you will die just the same,
Kaya Maghan offers 18 kilos of gold to whosoever succeeds in finding Sia!
Sacrificing human beings, how appalling,
Human life is sacred!
I declare it, most solemnly!
Sacrificing human beings, how appalling,
Misery!
Misery!
He who sows misery, reaps but penury!
Men and women!
Heed what I say!
Listen to the good news from the palace.
Kaya Maghan has announced that whosoever succeeds in finding Sia will be rewarded with 18 kilos of gold.
The word of our Emperor, Kaya Maghan!
Men and women of Koumbi!
Informers!
May you be cursed to damnation!
Kaya Maghan!
Master of the Universe!
No need to hurry!
Like this cat!
Completely drowned!
Be patient, you wretch.
We' il have your hide.
Sia cannot have disappeared, it' s impossible.
Wakhane.
I want her at my feet... without delay.
Wakhane, laxity is rampant in this country.
That madman insults me all over town.
And you let him do it.
You must understand.
Kerfa would be more of a nuisance dead than alive.
As long as he speaks, he' s but a madman keeping the people amused.
But any violence unto him would make him a martyr.
You are right.
Now, find Sia.
As for the rest, we shall see later.
I know you enjoy Kerfa' s talk.
Kerfa is crazy, but not you.
Beat them good and well.
And you, do your job, castigate them.
Repeat:
Kaya Maghan the benefactor!
Python- God the saviour!
They give us rain!
They give us gold!
They protect us!
Very well.
Lock them up.
And make them talk.
Twins!
Close off the town and root out that girl.
Put down all subversion and resistance.
Soldiers!
With one exception.
Kerfa!
Don' t touch him.
He continually insults the emperor!
Do not touch him!
I said, not a hair on his head!
Is that clear?
It' s clear.
- Arrest them!
- It' s him!
- Who?
- You!
Why?
Let me go!
Take them away!
Let go of me!
Mercy!
That' il do!
I know you regularly hold subversive meetings.
True or false?
This farce has gone on long enough.
You will reveal Sia' s hideout.
Lock them up and put the screws on, until they talk.
Take them away!
Mercy!
Bring forth Sia' s parents!
Who are Sia' s parents?
Leave them be!
They are innocent.
Bunch of cowards!
Did you hear?
I wasn' t dreaming!
She insulted us!
Take her away!
Sacrifice me in Sia' s stead and stop torturing these people.
Even if they are accomplices, they' il never confess.
They' ve got balls.
And you have none!
This girl is possessed.
Lock the witch up!
On your feet!
So?
Still don' t want to confess?
We know nothing.
We have no reason to hide her.
Sia is not the first, nor will she be the last.
Penda is right!
If I were an accomplice, I' d never own up!
In this land, bastards have a name.
We ought to find one for unworthy fathers!
Woman, what do you mean by that?
Ignore her, she is beside herself, she is mad.
I am not mad!
Wakhane knows what I mean!
Let them go.
What?
Let them all go!
Why does Wakhane arrest everyone only to let them go?
Queen of queens, every ill has its remedy.
He knows what he' s doing.
It' s a subtle strategy!
Wakhane is hiding something from you.
Nothing!
Wakhane can hide nothing from me.
Without me, Wakhane is nothing.
The corpse doesn' t play hide and seek with the undertaker.
Fine!
Don' t say I didn' t warn you.
Cat is better than chicken,,, All a question of recipe,
Where is Sia?
Perhaps you know.
Good- for- nothing!
She is not here.
She wouldn' t hide out with a madman.
From now on, mind your manners, or we' il break your face, crazy old fool!
Move out!
Kerfa, I' m afraid.
Kerfa, listen.
I think he saw me.
Have no fear, they won' t be back.
I don' t want to die.
No one wants to die.
Who told you you' re going to die?
It' s done!
Come, it' s really good.
A delicious cat!
- No, I' m not hungry.
- Then hide.
You said they' d not be back!
Did I say that?
Perhaps it' s true!
But nothing is sure.
It all depends.
It' s red hot!
I don' t want to die.
Then, you' il not die!
How do you know?
The griots will one day tell the country' s children, that a young girl called Sia Yatabere was chosen from among the most beautiful to be sacrificed to the Python- God.
Her fiancé hastened to save her.
But Sia refused to flee.
In the name of all girls sacrificed, she preferred to brave death...
Speak, Kerfa!
I want to know all!
You' il know when the story has run its course...
If you still live.
But you said I won' t die.
I fear for my parents...
What does this story hold for them?
What does it hold for them?
They will be forgotten.
A father and a mother, are but a trifle.
A simple meeting.
- I' ve just seen Sia.
- Where?
In Kerfa the madman' s hut.
Did anyone else see her?
No, no one.
Then don' t tell a soul.
Have Mamadi return from the front as soon as possible.
So he can say his farewells to Sia.
Does Mamadi know I' m in danger?
Mamadi?
Who is Mamadi?
My fiancé!
You just spoke of him...
He' il come to save me.
Mamadi!
He will come, but you won' t get far.
Why not?
Wakhane' s soldiers are everywhere.
And you, what does this story hold for you?
Me?
What matter!
All stories have their madmen, but madmen never have stories...
Sleep well, tomorrow will be a long day.
Well?
If your men don' t find Sia, choose another girl!
There are lots of other virgin, noble girls in this land.
Never!
It shall be Sia.
I gave my word.
My authority will not be bargained with.
There' il be no affront to my power.
Well said!
So what do you intend to do?
You speak of authority?
You have no more authority!
The people are party to this flight.
Your authority' s been ridiculed.
Your army leader will walk out on you.
I' m telling you again.
Your griot and your advisors are but your echo.
A bunch of yes men!
Wake up, quick, if you value your skin.
The fire burns the forest!
The water quells the fire!
The sand drinks the water!
The wind scatters the sand!
Master of the sand, master of the forest, master of the water.
The greatest of great heroes, Cisse!
So, honourable court...
This Sia affair is threatening the stability of the country.
You too, may have your say.
Kaya Maghan wants to have your opinion on the situation.
Kaya Maghan, my investigation is progressing.
My men are mobilised.
They are working on it.
Give me one more day, just one!
And Sia will be at your feet.
Majesty!
The priests' patience has its limits.
We must save the people from the Python' s wrath.
The fate of the country is in our hands.
We must find another solution.
Balla, what do you think?
Absolutely, what matters is the sacrifice.
Never!
To give up on Sia, is a slight to my authority.
How could you dream of such a thing?
Majesty...
You are right...
You are totally right!
If we give up on Sia, the people will take it as a sign of weakness.
Wakhane!
Bring that madman here forthwith.
Fetch him here, I want to meet him.
Right!
That' s what we' il do.
Cut out the tongue of that madman who incites the people to disobedience.
Do not arrest him.
Have him come.
I want to see him, meet him, speak to him.
Speak to him?
That bothers you?
You, Kaya Maghan... speak to a madman?
I' d rather speak to a madman than to a bunch of puppet advisors, who are inapt and opinionless.
Kerfa the madman, we salute you,,,
Stop!
Little brats!
Kerfa!
Calm down!
Filthy urchins!
It' s you who are crazy.
Me, I have no name.
I even have no age.
I am invisible and imperceptible!
A curse on you!
And on your parents!
Malingering parents who abandon their children!
Let go of me!
What do you want?
- Move, scum!
- Shut it and move!
Get going!
Majesty!
Here is the man whose tongue has agitated the entire town.
This is he.
See?
They' d have my tongue, yet they bind my arms!
Stupid!
On your knees before justice!
No!
Never!
Never!
Is your rule on its knees?
If it is upright, I will remain standing!
Break his face and his legs!
On your knees!
Let him go!
Lay not a finger on him.
If he wishes, let him stand and let him speak!
Speak, me?
It is for you to speak.
I didn' t ask for an audience.
I' m giving you the chance to repent.
I shall offer your life to the priests for having blasphemed.
Kill me?
I' m not afraid of death!
I know how to wake up when I die.
Kaya Maghan, you are not like me.
If you die...
If you die, you do not know how to wake!
In fact, you are already dead, because you are asleep!
Sleep does not govern.
- Leave us.
- What?
Leave you alone?
This man is mad!
I cannot.
I am responsible for your safety.
I said leave us alone!
Untie him.
Out.
All of you!
So you are Kerfa the madman...
He who insults me all over town.
Despite all, I don' t wish to harm you.
I want you to speak for me too.
I want to be closer to my people.
Speak for you?
Out of the question!
You have too many!
The griots, the advisors, the soldiers, already speak but for you.
I am tired of hearing them.
They' re a bunch of yes men.
I' m awash in an ocean of complacency.
That' s why I need you!
I want to hear the voice of my people!
Kaya Maghan seeks his people!
Listen awhile to the murmurs of the town.
I have often listened, yet neither joy nor pain comes to my ears.
Help me.
I want to know my people better.
He wants to know his people better.
Your people are there!
Outside!
Today, they sing for you.
But tomorrow, they will trample you and sing for another tyrant.
The voice of the people is clear!
It resounds like an emperor' s fart, a fart that everyone pretends not to hear!
Who are you?
Me?
I am but the dream of others.
- Right!
Then Kerfa, be my dream too!
Dream for my people!
- What' s this?
- Here.
- What?
- Take the throne and dream.
Me?
Never!
Keep your throne!
My dreams belong to me alone!
Nothing is anyone' s!
All belongs to me, even you and your madness!
Leave my madness alone!
Hands off!
Let me seek myself.
Me, I seek myself!
He is already dead!
Kaya Maghan is dead!
Kerfa!
I will kill you!
I' il wipe you out!
Kill me?
But I am already dead!
Dead, but awake!
Every day I die.
If you cannot die and wake, you are nothing!
Believe me...
Nothing!
- Still here...
- Where were you?
- At the palace, with Kaya Maghan.
- Kaya Maghan?
Yes, with Kaya Maghan.
- They' re going to kill me too.
- Kill you?
Why?
Because of me?
No, because of myself.
They wanted my dreams, my madness.
I refused!
Not just anyone can be mad!
You must earn it!
Kaya Maghan is thinking ahead, he wants to be rid of his advisors, his priests.
He wants to reach out to the people before the revolt.
But it' s too late.
The wind is against him.
The force of the waves will engulf him.
What are you on about?
I don' t understand a thing!
He wants to make a hippopotamus of me and hang onto my back.
What he wants is...
I don' t care what Kaya Maghan wants.
I want to live!
Live!
Women!
You can never fathom them!
She has the honour of being the prettiest and she gets angry!
The honour of the sacred sheep!
I am not a sheep, I am a woman!
I don' t want to be sacrificed.
Help me.
Get up.
Listen...
Dry your tears.
He' s coming.
Who?
Who?
Your horseman!
Mamadi!
He who acts more than he speaks.
We' il see if he deserves his reputation.
Come!
Kerfa, I' m lost for what to do.
Whatever you do, the story will run its course.
Follow your instinct!
Come, I' il take you away!
I thank you for having come, but we won' t get far.
Your uncle' s men are everywhere.
Nothing can stop me.
Let' s be gone from here.
Be gone from here?
You mean, flee from here!
Fleeing...
Always fleeing!
Some valiant soldier you are!
Don' t touch him!
He saved my life.
I' d have cut your head off!
Thanks to Sia, I spare you.
You fool!
My head wouldn' t make you a hero.
Go see the Python, he has seven.
You can chop off as many heads as you like.
Be off!
I' il stay here and wait for death.
Very well!
I' ve understood.
Come and hide, carnage is brewing.
Come.
I' m scared, Mamadi is risking his life.
Risk?
Risk is everywhere!
There' s as much risk at the front as in town...
Come.
Come!
Seize her!
Kerfa!
Let go of me!
Sia!
Don' t worry!
Whatever happens, I will be there with you!
In the Python' s lair!
My uncle, you have betrayed me.
I' ve betrayed no one.
You have said your farewells to Sia as was my duty.
Now you have seen her, go back to your post.
I will never abandon Sia.
Then I must arrest you for desertion.
I no longer obey Kaya Maghan.
Mamadi!
Listen!
Whatever you do, Sia will be sacrificed.
There is nothing you can do, I' ve already arrested her.
You dare deliver my fiancée to death with your own hands?
Sia' s death is no less worthy than the death you court at the front.
Sia must die for the entire country.
Sia will not die.
I shall kill the Python.
What?
Did I hear you right?
I shall kill the Python to save Sia.
You would kill the Python- God and dare say it to the head of the armies?
I say it to my uncle.
It' s up to you, whether the uncle or the general heard me.
This boy has lost his wits.
Lock him up!
Do as I say!
Listen!
We must take to the streets and say no to Kaya Maghan and his priests.
No way!
You' re crazy!
Forgotten what we' ve been through?
Have you forgotten?
Next time they' il cut our balls off.
Get out of here!
You lily liver!
Kaya Maghan is neither devil nor genie.
He' il not wipe us out!
He needs us in order to exist!
Fine, if you want to die, off you go.
Stop blubbering and work!
We bring grave news.
Fraught with consequences.
Twins, speak!
Wakhane is preparing a coup d' Etat.
Mamadi has returned from the front to help him.
But they haven' t yet made their move.
We spied upon their plot.
We must act quickly!
Are you sure of your accusations?
Of course, go to Wakhane' s, Mamadi is there.
Wakhane has never been clear.
He must be dismissed.
Balla!
Go and get Keletigui.
Discreetly.
I appoint him head of my armies.
Let him organise Wakhane' s arrest.
At once!
Good day, where is your husband?
He' s sleeping.
Sleeping?
You seem pretty worked up.
Wake him.
It' s very urgent.
Keletigui, grave news.
Wakhane is preparing a coup d' Etat.
The emperor has named you in his stead.
Quick, to the palace...
- Wait, who' s spreading this gossip?
- The twins!
They overheard Wakhane and Mamadi plotting to kill the Python- God.
This information is false.
In any case, I shall remain loyal to my general, Wakhane!
It' s false, isn' t it?
Wakhane could never do such a thing, he' s no traitor!
Release your nephew, you are of the same blood.
We have given enough.
I repeat, the interests of State come before those of family.
Bad news, the emperor is out for your blood.
Why?
What' s going on?
I' m telling you, it' s serious.
The priests accuse you of plotting against Kaya Maghan.
They' re sure of it.
The twins told them.
Kaya Maghan has already dismissed you.
You' re in real trouble.
Keletigui!
Free Mamadi.
The emperor has lost his mind.
He' s flipped!
You saw him!
He wanted to ally with Kerfa the madman.
We are all in danger.
Careful!
Great Master, from the dawning of time, we have been your griots.
You well know, I wish to die by your side.
Untie him.
- Where is Sia?
- There is no time to lose.
Rally our troops and meet me at the caves.
Incredible!
Never does the vulture sing!
Never does the hyena dance!
People of Koumbi, you are cursed!
I hate your songs and dances.
They stink!
Blind tam- tams!
Deaf tam- tams!
Blind tam- tams...
Deaf tam- tams...
Wakhane, Keletigui and Mamadi deserted before my very eyes.
Exactly as we feared.
They must be found, arrested before they act.
Balla!
I entrust the troops to the twins.
May they bring back Wakhane dead or alive!
Twins, the troops are yours.
What are you waiting for?
Follow me.
- You want we act together?
- Yes, of course.
It gives me the chance to make amends.
I have been tormented by a feeling of guilt.
"Little- Mother"?
Yes.
Who is "Little- Mother"?
My daughter...
Your cousin, "Little- Mother".
You don' t remember, you were only a child.
At sixteen, they delivered her up to the Python.
I' il never forget the look on her face that day.
Her distraught antelope eyes, begging.
- My poor uncle...
- Let me speak.
There is a time for everything.
Do not console me, I am not to be pitied.
I am an unworthy father.
You know what "Little- Mother" said to me on the day of the sacrifice?
Do you know?
She said:
"Father!
You always told me that death was invisible.
"I am not afraid of death.
"It is the serpent that I fear...
"I don' t want to see the Python!"
Do you know what I did that day?
Do you know?
I refused!
I closed my eyes so not to see her tremble...
I sinned out of sheer pride.
I didn' t want that a girl of my flesh and blood tremble before death.
Uncle, for "Little- Mother" and for Sia, we must kill this monster.
Kaya Maghan named me head of the armies to console me for her loss.
But it is impossible to forget.
My only reason to live is to take revenge upon myself.
Mamadi, listen well.
What I' m about to tell you is capital.
Tomorrow, I will make you Kaya Maghan.
- Kaya Maghan?
- Right.
I don' t understand.
You want to kill the Python- God.
When one kills the gods, one must reinvent the world.
I don' t want to reinvent the world!
All that matters to me is Sia.
You have no choice.
If you refuse, I lay down our arms, we are arrested, Sia is sacrificed.
Is that your wish?
So be it, Uncle.
But why not you?
No, you know how unpopular I am.
I have inflicted too much suffering upon the people.
They' il not forget that.
I' ve told you before, the people need heroes.
Majesty, the town is on state of alert.
We have the situation under control.
There is nothing to fear.
And my people?
Are my people worried?
- What do they say?
- Your people?
Your people is calm.
We' ve imposed a curfew.
The streets are empty.
Good luck.
Move out!
So...
What news of Kerfa the madman?
You ordered me to protect him.
Your instructions have been respected.
Now... do away with him... and spread the rumour that Kaya Maghan had him killed because of his blaspheming.
Go!
Let go of me!
You, you, you...
This way.
The others, that way.
Remove your caps.
You, that way.
What happened?
The Python doesn' t exist...
Does it?
So what happened?
The priests raped me.
They stole my virginity.
All seven set fire to my belly.
You should have let me die.
I' d rather death... than life.
I am completely sullied.
I want to die.
I want to die.
Catch them!
Where is Kerfa?
Kerfa!
Kerfa promised to die there with me...
Kerfa!
Well?
How did it go?
Answer me!
Have you lost your tongues?
The Python- God doesn' t exist.
What?
What are you saying?
In the lair, there were only some human skeletons.
No python?
And the priests?
They raped Sia.
They were preparing to kill her, we put them all to death.
Here are their soutanes.
Let no one move from here.
Wait for my instructions.
How is she?
I don' t know.
She' s not speaking.
Come...
It is not over.
So...
We have to keep this news secret.
What do you mean?
We shall pretend that you killed the Python- God.
You will be "the emperor who dethroned a god".
But it' s not true!
I' ve already told you, the people need heroes.
You are a good soldier, a fine master of arms, but your political education is wanting.
I will take care of it.
Some secret!
All my men know about it!
I' il see to them.
The real danger, is Sia...
Sia?
Why Sia?
You have killed the Python- God, in the eyes of the people you will be a god.
Sia must preserve the mystery of this power.
Return by her side.
Go...
Go on!
Give that here.
I am proud of you.
You' ve done a good job.
But... this news must be kept secret.
I will entrust you with another mission.
Wait here.
You, go tell Keletigui to meet me in my cave.
Hurry!
Greetings!
Come in, I was expecting you.
The soldiers who were present must die immediately.
They must speak to no one.
As you wish.
Consider it done!
Off you go!
Traitors!
Got what they deserved.
Bury them together.
Do you hear this din around the palace?
Lay down your arms!
The Python- God is dead!
All the troops have sided with us!
Never!
Not on your life!
We' il fight to the last man!
- To arms!
- Live or die!
What' s going on?
I hear cries outside.
What are my soldiers doing?
I want to know!
I' il go see.
Lay down your arms!
There must be no slaughter!
Why?
It cannot be!
Kaya Maghan has ordered it!
Lay down your arms!
Tell the others outside!
Lay down your arms!
Kaya Maghan has ordered it!
Follow me!
Valorous liberators!
Follow me!
Saviours of the people!
The puppet Kaya Maghan is overthrown!
Move!
No power is eternal.
You have long oppressed the people, now it' s your turn.
We' re arresting you!
Wait!
Respect him!
He was our emperor.
Do not tie him.
Show some tact.
Take him away!
Do your work!
Mother!
Mother!
Sia has been saved!
What?
The python is dead!
Mamadi killed it!
Incredible!
Out!
Understand?
Out with you!
Hurry up!
Let' s go!
Give them provisions and escort them out of the country.
Take them away.
Long live Mamadi!
Long live Mamadi!
Let go of me!
Don' t get so worked up!
This business is far from clear.
You' re always so sceptical.
- Beat it!
- Same to you!
Long live Mamadi!
Everything' s ready.
They' re waiting for us.
Very well, go and get Sia.
Right away.
Sia!
Most beautiful of queens, it is time to emerge!
Sia, I' m talking to you, Mamadi is waiting.
Sia!
All is ready, the people are waiting.
What' s come over her?
What' s wrong with her?
Come, it is time.
Let' s go!
What is Balla up to?
The people are calling for us.
The people are getting restless.
Let' s go!
I do not speak of puppet heroes!
I do not speak of ordinary heroes!
But of heroes who defy all heroes, who have vanquished the underworld, who have overthrown a god, who have ended the bloodthirsty reign of Kaya Maghan.
Heroes of the people!
The dog who defies the panther!
The lizard who defies the crocodile!
The people are proud of you!
The new... new...
Kaya Maghan!
Your will is our will!
We salute you!
We salute you!
Hero of heroes!
Wakhane of noble lineage!
We salute Wakhane Sakho, uncle of the new Kaya Maghan.
People of Koumbi!
People of Wagadu!
The murderous god, the Python is no more!
Kaya Maghan is no more!
They are dead!
Henceforth, you are free!
We shall open all the prisons!
Our new power is the power of the people!
Your power!
Sia!
Empress Sia!
We salute her!
We salute her!
The new empress is tired after her ordeal.
An ordeal, such as only heroes can surmount.
Let her rest a little.
In a few moments, she will shine like the full moon...
Here I am!
Mamadi, what' s going on?
What is going on?
Sia, listen to me...
Heroes who tremble...
When I will have told all you will tremble even more.
It is we who saved your life.
We can reduce you to silence.
You want to perpetrate a lie?
To change falsehood into truth?
Sia, do not wreck our hopes...
I was raped, Mamadi.
I was raped, sullied.
Be patient.
She is not yet over the shock.
Give her a little time.
Mamadi, that' s enough.
Now you must choose.
Either she perishes, or we do.
Let me handle this.
Keletigui!
Take her away!
Wait!
Arrest him for cruelty to the people!
Arrest him, I am the new Kaya Maghan!
Keletigui!
I said arrest that girl!
Is that clear?
Arrest her!
Mamadi, my nephew, well played...
You did well...
You' re a quick learner...
Ah!
"Little- Mother"...
When I think of my daughter...
She, who was so scared... of snakes.
Keletigui!
I name you head of my armies!
Take Wakhane away.
He was a great leader.
The new Kaya Maghan is dead!
Dead in the well of endless falsehood!
Dead from the very beginning!
That he die...
That he live...
What matter!
Let go of me!
Don' t touch me.
There' s no use in dying if you don' t know how to wake up.
Keletigui!
Take this madwoman out!
Kaya Maghan is dead.
Let her be gone.
She has lost her wits.
I salute you all!
I salute Kaya Maghan and his people!
The night belongs to spirits, the day belongs to doings!
People of Koumbi, wake up sleep does not rule this world!
Misery!
Misery!
He who sows misery, reaps but penury!
Misery!
Misery!
He who sows misery, reaps but penury!

Wher e ar e they?
Dad!
Uncle Merrill!
Morgan!
Bo?
Bo, wher e' s Morgan?
Ar e you in my dr eam, too?
-- This is not a dr -- -- Dad!
What' s happening?
The dogs wer e barking -- woke us up.
Ar e you hurt?
I think God did it.
Did what, Morgan?
Look, Lee, I don' t even car e if it was him.
And you can just have a word with him, and that' d be enough f or me.
See, it was strange finding the crops that way.
The kids wer e conf used by it, and, uh, it' d sur e take the strangeness away if I knew it was just Lionel and the Wolfington brothers messing around, that' s all.
Ar e you sur e?
Alright, then.
Uh, thanks f or your patience, Lee.
Houdini peed.
I think he' s sick.
Why don' t you take him outside?
I' il call Dr. Crawf ord.
He doesn' t tr eat animals.
Well, he' il know what to do.
That was quick, Caroline.
I only called you f olks two hours ago.
Old Mrs. Kendleman twisted her ankle, as she puts it, diving f or her lif e when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards.
She went down to Thornton' s stor e this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards.
Spitting!
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed the whole damned place.
And she must have had a cold or something.
I' m telling you, I won' t eat f or a week.
So, what happened to your crops?
Dad' s gonna burn these again.
It' s contaminated.
You don' t even know what that word means.
It' s not contaminated.
Pour it in his bowl.
It tastes f unny.
It does not.
And besides, he licks his butt every day.
I don' t think he' il mind.
Bo, don' t run.
What' s wrong, boy?
Stop it, Houdini.
Look at wher e it' s bent over, Father.
It' s not broken.
Now, what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without br eaking it?
It' s too perf ect.
It doesn' t sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.
They can' t take a piss without wetting the f ront of their pants.
I don' t think anyone else around her e has had any problems.
I was over at Theo Henry' s f arm yesterday afternoon, and he would have mentioned something.
Why wer e you at Theo' s place?
Some animals around the county have been acting f unny -- and some of them violent.
What is it, a virus?
I don' t think so, Father.
They' r e mor e edgy, you know, and alert.
It' s almost like they act when they smell a pr edator around -- peeing on themselves and everything.
Caroline... please stop calling me "Father."
What' s wrong?
I don' t hear my childr en.
He f ell on me.
He wanted to kill Bo.
Did he hurt you?
No.
I' m so sorry, Morgan.
Wher e wer e you?
Houdini' s sick.
Tie Isabel up to the back of the shed, please, and make sur e the knot' s very tight.
What' s the matter?
Ther e' s a monster outside my room.
Can I have a glass of water?
What' s wrong with the water next to your bed?
It tastes old.
What ar e you thinking about?
Why do you talk to Mom when you' r e by yourself?
Makes me f eel better.
Does she ever answer back?
She never answers me either.
Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers ar e back.
It' s time f or an arse- whupping.
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Lee is a f riend of mine.
Yeah, we' il be doing Lee a f avour.
Alright, listen -- we both go outside, move around the house in opposite dir ections.
We act crazy, insane with anger -- make them crap in their pants, f orce them around till we meet up on the other side.
Explain "act crazy."
You know, curse and stuff.
You want me to curse?
It' s just f or show.
Well, it won' t be convincing.
It doesn' t sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises, then.
Explain "noises."
Ar e you gonna do this or what?
Alright, you want them stealing something in the house next time?
On the count of thr ee --
I' m insane with anger!
We' r e gonna beat your arse, bitch!
We' r e gonna tear your head off!
I' m losing my mind!
It' s time f or an arse- whupping!
I cursed.
I heard.
How did he get...
Ar e you sur e this is Lionel Prichard?
You like that?
You got an old baby monitor around?
Bo had an old baby monitor.
You can use Bo' s baby monitor as a walkie- talkie.
It only works one way, but that' il do fine.
That is, until someone gets you an old walkie- talkie left over at the station.
Doy- da!
You' r e too old to still be doing this.
You take a glass of water, and you finish it.
Now, what' s wrong with this one?
It has dust in it.
This one?
A hair.
Morgan took a sip, and it has his amoebas in it.
So, how ar e you, Merrill?
Fine.
How is work at the gas station?
Stimulating.
I never got a chance to tell you, but l- I thought your moving in her e with your brother after -- it was a nice thing to do.
Well, I don' t think I' m helping much.
You ar e.
Okay, so f ar I have, "It was very dark."
You can' t describe him at all?
Don' t you think that' s kind of odd?
A little.
I don' t know whether to look f or a giant or a midget.
No, he definitely wasn' t a midget.
So he was tall?
l- I would say so, yes.
Probably.
Over 6 f eet?
It was very dark.
Yes, it was.
How certain ar e you that this was a male?
Oh, I don' t know -- I don' t know any girls who could run like that.
I don' t know, Merrill.
They can run like the wind.
This guy got on our roof in, like, a second.
O- Our roof is 10 f eet high.
They have women' s high jumping in the Olympics.
They got these Scandinavian women who can jump clean over me.
Caroline, I know you' r e making a point her e, but I just don' t know what it is.
An out- of- town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yelling and cussing because they didn' t have her f avourite cigar ettes at the vending machine.
She scar ed a couple of the customers.
And my point is, we don' t know anything about the person you saw, and we should just keep all possibilities available.
Dad, wher e' s the r emote?
I don' t know, baby.
Why don' t you check in the sof a cushions?
Ex cluding the possibility that a f emale Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else might be a possibility?
I' m not done asking questions, and I don' t appr eciate sarcasm.
Do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you -- maybe a- a church member who -- who might not have liked the f act that you left the church?
I don' t think so.
Okay, I was out of line with the whole f emale - Scandinavian- Olympian thing.
It' s just, I' m pr etty strong, and I' m pr etty f ast.
And I was running as f ast as I could, and this guy, he was -- he was just toying with us.
Ther e' s only f ood under the sof a.
Baby, why don' t you just change the channel on the television?
I did.
Same show' s on every station.
Bo, turn up the volume.
Crop signs first emerged in the late '70s with r enewed inter est in extraterr estrial lif e.
They died out by the early '80s, dismissed as hoax es.
This new r esurgence is wholly diff er ent.
The speed and the quantity in which it has appear ed implies the coordination of hundr eds of individuals over many countries.
Ther e ar e only a limited number of explanations.
Either this is one of the most elaborate hoax es ever cr eated, or basically... it' s f or r eal.
Extraterr estrials.
What in God' s name is going on?
I did some r esearch after I saw your crops.
Two or thr ee guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overnight using just boards and ropes.
That' s how these things have been done in the past.
But ther e ar e so many now.
How could so many people be in on it?
I can' t think straight.
I' m -- I' m gonna go back to the station and have a cup of Edgar' s coff ee and -- and try to think clear.
I might make some calls.
But I' il tell you something -- what I said in ther e, it still goes.
Your -- your f amily has been through a lot.
And the last thing these childr en need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world.
Now, take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things, hmm?
Good medicine.
That' s good advice.
And you take car e of yourself...
Graham.
The f ootage you' r e watching was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34- year- old local cameraman in Bangalor e, a southern city of India.
It' s the 18th r eported crop sign f ound in that country in the last 72 hours.
Uncle Merrill, will you turn on the radio?
They ar e signs intended to be seen f rom the sky --
No radio either.
Just f or a while.
Book money?
Just one.
Be back f or pizza in 15.
It' s just a bunch of crock.
They' r e trying to sell sodas.
Been watching these r eports since morning.
I have seen 12 soda commercials so f ar -- 12!
You have any books on extraterr estrials?
Now, don' t tell me you believe this horse manur e.
As a matter of f act, I think we have one.
Came by mistake in a shipment -- decided to keep it f or the city people.
Last row, third book on the left, honey.
Why is no one saying the obvious?
These ar e just copycats.
Someone somewher e does the first one...
It was asthma medicine, right, Father?
For Morgan Hess.
In less than an hour, a couple hundr ed people get the same brilliant idea, and her e we ar e, on the verge of mass hysteria.
Can I ask you a f avour, Father?
I need to clear my conscience.
Will you listen to me?
Tracey... I am not a r ever end anymor e.
I haven' t been f or six months.
You know this.
All this stuff on TV -- two girls came in her e talking about the end of the world --
I' m just a little scar ed.
Please, I need to clear my conscience.
I' ve got it figur ed.
I' ve had two separate f olks tell me ther e have been strangers around these parts last couple nights.
'cause they' r e staying in the shadows -- covertlike.
Nobody' s been hurt, mind you.
And that' s the giveaway.
I see.
It' s a military procedur e.
You send out a r econnaissance group -- very small -- to check things out.
Not to engage but to evaluate the situation -- evaluate the level of danger, make sur e things ar e all clear.
Clear f or what?
For the r est of them.
You got a pamphlet or something I can r ead?
You didn' t used to play baseball, did ya?
Shit, I know you.
You' r e Merrill Hess.
I was ther e the day you hit that 507- f ooter over the left- field wall -- set the r ecord.
Man, that thing had a motor on it.
It' s still the r ecord, right?
Got the bat at home o- on the wall.
You' ve got two minor- league home- run r ecords, don' t ya?
Five.
Why wer en' t you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting your toes licked by beautif ul women?
'Cause he has another r ecord most people don' t know about.
He has the minor- league strikeout r ecord.
Merrill' s a class- A scr ew- up.
He would just swing that bat as hard as he could every time.
Didn' t matter what the coaches said, didn' t matter who was on base.
He would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could.
Looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tr ee.
Merrill her e has mor e strikeouts than any two players.
You r eally got the strikeout r ecord?
Felt wrong not to swing.
It' s contaminated.
Carl, ther e' s something wrong with our water.
Your water' s fine.
Bo has this thing about her drinking water.
She had it her whole lif e.
It' s like a tick people have, ex cept it' s not a tick.
Is that right?
13!
I wanna pop
I cursed 37 times last week.
I said the "F" word a couple times, but mostly... "shits" and... "bastards."
Is "douche bag" a curse?
I suppose that would depend on its usage.
How about, "John, you' r e a douche bag f or kissing Barbara"?
It' s a curse.
Then it' s not 37.
Pharmacy crowded?
I don' t want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone.
Is that understood?
Is that him?
Who is he?
What is it?
It' s Bo' s baby monitor.
I f ound it in the basement.
I' m gonna use it as a walkie- talkie.
What if it' s catching a signal f rom them?
It' s not.
But it wasn' t working.
Morgan, this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlf riend in their lives.
They' r e, like, 30, and they work up little codes together, and they analyse Gr eek mythology and make up secr et societies wher e other guys who never had girlf riends bef or e can join in.
They do stupid crap like this to f eel special.
It' s a scam.
Nerds wer e doing it 25 years ago, and new nerds ar e doing it again.
It' s just static, Morgan, alright.
See.
It' s a code.
Why can' t they get girlf riends?
Can I see that, please?
It' s noise.
It' s just gonna keep doing this.
Maybe some new batteries...
We might lose the signal.
This is exactly what the nerds want.
I' m getting out now.
Nobody move.
Voices.
Did you hear that?
Not English, though.
You heard the voices, right, Uncle Merrill?
I heard them, Morgan.
Probably picking up another baby monitor.
See, this is why we' r e not watching TV.
People get obsessed.
I' m letting go now.
No, Dad!
Don' t do it!
You' il lose the signal.
Don' t let go.
It gets clear er the higher you hold it.
Bo, honey, I don' t want you climbing on the car.
Ther e' s two of them talking.
Isabel, you' r e gonna f eel very silly when this turns out to be all just make- believe.
You' r e wasting your time her e!
I' m not gonna r eport this or anything you do to my crops to the news or TV or anybody!
You' r e not going to get f amous!
Let' s turn on the TV.
It first appear ed 52 minutes ago.
Mexico City officials as well as U. S. officials have confirmed that these ar e not aircraft f rom either government' s air f orce.
The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 7 47 en route f rom Mazatlán to New York as the unidentified crafts enter ed Mexico City air space.
They wer e not detected by radar by either country.
The nerds wer e right.
We have to tape this.
My ballet r ecital.
Listen, Bo, this is very important.
Everything people have written about in science books is going to change.
The history of the world' s f utur e is on the TV right now.
We need to r ecord this so you can show your childr en this tape and say you wer e ther e.
For your childr en, Bo.
My ballet r ecital.
Dad!
Find another tape.
Uncle Merrill, I' m using your tape.
You ar e seeing a live f eed f rom our affiliate down her e in Mexico City.
This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way.
It' s unbelievable.
Everything they wrote in science books is about to change.
I told you.
Some people ar e probably thinking this is the end of the world.
That' s true.
Do you think it could be?
How can you say that?
That wasn' t the answer you wanted?
Couldn' t you pr etend to be like you used to be?
Give me some comf ort.
People br eak down into two groups when they experience something lucky.
Group number one sees it as mor e than luck, mor e than coincidence.
They see it as a sign -- evidence that ther e is someone up ther e watching out f or them.
Group number two sees it as just pur e luck, a happy turn of chance.
I' m sur e the people in group number two ar e looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way.
For them, the situation isn' t 50- 50.
Could be bad, could be good.
But deep down, they f eel that whatever happens, they' r e on their own.
And that fills them with f ear.
Yeah, ther e ar e those people.
But ther e' s a whole lot of people in the group number one.
When they see those 14 lights, they' r e looking at a miracle.
And deep down, they f eel that whatever' s going to happen, ther e' il be someone ther e to help them.
And that fills them with hope.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person ar e you?
Ar e you the kind who sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Or look at the question this way -- is it possible that ther e ar e no coincidences?
I was at this party once.
I' m on the couch with Randa McKinney.
looking beautif ul, staring at me.
I go to lean in and kiss her... and I r ealise I have gum in my mouth.
So I turn, take out the gum, stuff it in a paper cup next to the sof a, and turn around.
Randa McKinney throws up all over herself.
I knew the second it happened it was a miracle.
I could have been kissing her when she thr ew up.
That would have scarr ed me f or lif e.
I may never have r ecover ed.
I' m a miracle man.
Those lights ar e a miracle.
Ther e you go.
So, which type ar e you?
Do you f eel comf orted?
Then what does it matter?
I never told you the last words that Colleen said bef or e they let her die.
She said, "See."
Then her eyes glazed a bit.
And then she said, "Swing away."
You know why she said that?
Because the nerve endings in her brain wer e firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games just popped into her head.
Ther e is no one watching out f or us, Merrill.
We ar e all on our own.
What do you know?
Well, ther e was an accident -- drunk driving, they wer en' t sur e --
Ray f ell asleep at the wheel.
-- Is he okay?
That was the first thing Colleen asked, too.
She' s talking.
What ambulance is she in?
She' s not in an ambulance, Father.
For the kids' protection.
All they wer e doing was watching TV f rom 5. 00 a. m.
I f elt like they wer e getting obsessed, like you said.
They should be playing f urry, f urry rabbit or tea party or something.
What' s f urry, f urry rabbit?
It' s a game, isn' t it?
Anyways, they closed the schools.
And ther e' s been some inter esting developments.
What time is it?
11. 00 a. m.
They' r e gone, but they' r e not r eally gone.
We just can' t see them.
It stopped dead in the air and f ell straight down.
They' ve been playing it all morning.
The f ootage looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.
His -- his head was crushed in.
They think they have some kind of invisible- shield thing going, l- like an optical illusion.
They' r e still ther e, hovering.
Some people think ther e' s mor e of them now... all over the place, over us, even.
Ther e' s a theory about the c -- the crop circles.
They could be some kind of -- some kind of landmark, visual mapping system so they could navigate, coordinate -- makes sense.
So the aliens can' t r ead our minds.
Oh, of course.
They tell you everything in this book.
It says they' r e probably very small, like my height, because as their brains develop, ther e was no use f or physical development.
It also says they' r e probably vegetarians because they would have r ealised the benefits of such a diet.
Who wrote this book?
Scientists who have been persecuted f or their belief s.
That means they' r e unemployed.
If you' r e gonna make f un of it, then f orget it.
This is serious.
I don' t know what got into me.
Ther e ar e pictur es.
Dr. Bimbu, one of the authors of the book --
-- Dad.
I just asked his name.
You had a tone.
He said ther e ar e two r easons why extraterr estrials would visit us -- to make contact in the spirit of exploration and f urthering the knowledge of the universe, or the other r eason -- they' r e hostile.
They' ve used up all the r esources on their planet, and they' r e looking to harvest our planet next.
Looks a little like our house, doesn' t it?
Same windows.
That' s weird.
That' s enough f rom Dr. Bimbu f or now.
Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some f ruit or something.
I' m going out f or a f ew minutes.
No one leaves this house -- no one.
Wher e you going?
Ray Reddy' s house.
Why?
I think he just called her e.
Why?
You have one of your f eelings again?
Is it bad?
I won' t let anything bad happen to you.
I don' t want you to die.
Who said I was gonna die?
Who said I was gonna die?
What happened?
I wrote your number down to call you.
It' s been sitting next to the phone f or 6 months.
I couldn' t think of any other number to call.
Thank you f or coming, Father.
You' r e welcome, Ray.
I worked so long that night.
I' ve never f allen asleep driving bef or e... never since.
Most of the ride home, ther e wasn' t a car in sight in either dir ection.
I would have ended up in a ditch with a headache.
And it had to be at that right moment -- that 10, 15 seconds when I passed her walking.
It was like it was meant to be.
I' m scr ewed, right?
People who kill r ever ends' wives ar en' t exactly usher ed to the f ront of the line in Heaven.
Wh -- Wher e ar e you going, Ray?
To the lake.
The way I see it... these places marked in crops and such -- none of them ar e r eally near water.
I don' t think they like water.
Can' t be any worse than her e.
Did you see something, Ray?
I know what I' ve done to you.
I made you question your f aith.
I' m truly sorry f or what I' ve done to you and yours.
And don' t open my pantry, Father.
I f ound one of them in ther e and locked him in.
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son' s 7th birthday in the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil.
It was sent to the local news bur eau ther e and sent to us via satellite just a f ew minutes ago.
All initial opinions ar e this is genuine.
What you' r e about to see may disturb you.
Move, childr en!
The police ar e her e.
I am with them.
I am a police officer.
I just want to talk with you.
We alr eady took some of your f riends downtown in a paddy waggon.
Just tell us your name and why you did it, and we' il give you the same deal we gave the others.
Don' t throw your lif e away, son.
Their skin changes colours.
That' s why we couldn' t see them that night.
Uh... in this book of yours... did they happen to detail what would happen if they wer e hostile?
It said they would probably invade.
They would use ground tactics -- hand- to- hand combat.
Then the planet would be useless to them.
How could anyone possibly know that inf ormation?
What else did it say?
They said ther e ar e one of two outcomes of an invasion.
One, they fight and ar e def eated and have to r eturn again with f ull f orces hundr eds, maybe even thousands, of years later.
What' s two?
They win.
I' m sorry, what -- what book is this?
Is this r eally happening?
I heard a theory that, uh, they don' t like places near water.
Maybe we' d be saf e f rom them near a lake or something.
Sounds made- up.
I saw one of them at Ray Reddy' s house.
I can' t be sur e, but I got the distinct f eeling he wanted to harm me.
So... we can choose to believe this lake idea, pack up, and go, or we can stay her e, hide inside our home, wait it out.
We might be overr eacting, but I' m willing to live with that.
Either way, at least we' il be together.
All those in f avour of the lake idea, raise your hand.
All those in f avour of home, raise your hand.
My vote counts as two.
You' r e cheating!
I get two votes because I r epr esent two par ents her e.
We don' t know anything yet.
We' il be saf e her e anyway.
I don' t want to leave home.
This is wher e we lived with Mom.
That' s got nothing to do with this.
I change my vote.
You can' t change your vote.
All those in f avour of home, raise your hand.
This is ridiculous.
You lose, 3- 2.
We' r e going to board up every window in this house.
How do we know boards will do anything?
Because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors.
The inf ormation we' r e r eceiving comes f rom our affiliates across the world.
Amman joins Nairobi, Beijing, and Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights.
Ther e ar e lights in over 27 4 cities.
They think it' il be 400 within the hour.
They' r e appearing at or within one mile of crop signs.
They were f or navigation.
They made a map.
They' r e gonna be within a mile of us.
They think these ar e staged immediately pr eceding an attack manoeuvr e.
I was wrong.
They' r e hostile.
It' s like "War of the Worlds."
Ground f orces have been assembled in countries throughout the globe.
Hundr eds of thousands have flocked to temples, synagogues, and churches.
God be with us all.
I' m going to get back to the windows.
Hey, you guys okay?
Some guy had a sign saying it was the end of the world.
Don' t worry.
You won' t let anything happen to us, right?
No way.
I wish you wer e my dad.
What did you say?
Don' t you ever say anything like that again.
Ever.
Ther e' s too many windows in the bedrooms.
We don' t have enough boards.
We' il board up the bedroom doors.
Wher e ar e we gonna sleep?
In the f amily room.
What about Isabel?
We' il tie her up in the garage after dinner.
I' il make some sandwiches.
I want spaghetti.
We' il just eat f ast, Bo.
Spaghetti sounds gr eat.
What do you want, Morgan?
Anything?
Fr ench toast... and mashed potatoes.
Now we' r e talking.
How about you, Merrill?
Chicken teriyaki.
Good choice.
I' m going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.
Extra bacon.
What' s the matter with everyone?
Maybe we should say a prayer.
Why not?
We' r e not saying a prayer.
Bo has a bad f eeling.
I had a dr eam.
We ar en' t saying a prayer.
Eat!
I hate you.
That' s fine.
You let Mom die.
I am not wasting one mor e minute of my lif e on prayer.
Not one mor e minute.
Understood?
Now we ar e going to enjoy this meal.
No one can stop us f rom enjoying this meal, so enjoy it!
Stop crying!
-- Don' t yell at her!
I' m gonna try some of everything.
It' s happening.
Graham, hurry.
Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you wer e born, Bo?
You came out of your mama, and you didn' t even cry.
You just opened your eyes, and you looked around the room at everybody.
Your eyes wer e so big and gorgeous.
All the ladies in the room just gasped.
I mean, they literally gasped.
And they go, "Oh, she' s like an angel."
And they said, "We' ve never seen a baby so beautif ul."
And then... you know what happened?
They put you on the table to clean you up, and you looked up at me and you smiled.
They say babies that young can' t smile.
You smiled.
Let' s go down now.
We f orgot Isabel.
Should we turn off the lights?
They alr eady know we' r e her e.
Do you know what happened when you wer e born, Morgan?
You came out, and your mama kept bleeding, so the doctors rushed you out of the room bef or e I even had time to see you.
They' r e on the roof.
While they wer e fixing her up, all she kept asking about was you.
They' r e in the house.
I wanted your mama to see you first because she had dr eamt about you her whole lif e.
Then she got f eeling better, they brought you in, and they placed you in her arms, and she looked at you, and you looked at her, and you just star ed at each other f or the longest time.
And then she said r eal soft,
"Hello, Morgan.
I' m your mama.
You look just how I dr eamt. "
The attic door.
We f orgot our f oil helmets.
Have we got anything to wedge against the door knob?
You' r e scaring your sister.
I' m alr eady scar ed.
I' m looking!
They' il know our secr et thoughts.
I' m not r eady.
Got it!
Wher e' s Bo?
I' m okay.
What' s happening out ther e?
I can' t even imagine.
I hope they' r e doing better than we ar e.
We don' t even have helmets.
They' r e only making noises.
They' r e not trying to get in.
Why would they do that?
They want our attention on the door?
From what?
The book says they' r e probably very good problem solvers.
They' il find a way in.
Morgan, give me your flashlight.
They used to pour coal down in this basement.
Ther e' s a coal chute in her e.
I can f eel air.
Me too!
It' s getting stronger.
I' m close.
We don' t have his medicine.
Don' t be af raid, Morgan.
We' il slow this down together.
Feel my chest.
Feel it moving in and out.
Br eathe like me.
I dr eamt this.
Stay with me.
I know it hurts.
Be strong, baby.
It' il pass.
Don' t do this to me again.
Not again.
I hate you.
The f ear is f eeding him.
Don' t be af raid of what' s happening.
Believe it.
Just wait.
The air is coming.
Believe.
We don' t have to be af raid.
It' s about to pass.
Her e it comes.
Don' t be af raid.
Feel my chest.
Br eathe with me.
The air is going in our lungs.
Together.
We' r e the same.
We should save the flashlights.
Ray' s truck swerved off the road and hit Colleen and then a tr ee, and she was pinned between the two.
What does that mean -- pinned?
The truck -- the truck has sever ed most of her lower half.
What did you say?
She won' t be saved.
Her body is pinned in such a way that it' s alive when it shouldn' t be alive, and the truck is holding her together.
And she doesn' t f eel much, and she' s -- she' s talking almost like normal, and we didn' t pull the truck out
'cause we -- we wanted you to come down her e and be with her as long as she' s awake.
And that won' t be very long.
Now, Father, do you understand what I' ve told you?
Caroline... is this the last time I' m gonna talk with my wif e?
That' s bull.
I don' t think that.
My f riend and I saw them.
I f ound a pack of light bulbs.
They dragged them away.
Nobody believes it, but they didn' t come her e f or our planet.
They came her e f or us, to harvest us.
We' r e lucky as hell they' r e leaving her e.
They' r e leaving?
That' s what they' r e saying.
How long have we been sleeping?
12 hours or so.
He said they had poison gas... they secr ete in small amounts.
A lot of people died.
But they' r e leaving.
They left r eal f ast this morning,
like something scar ed them off.
They left some of their wounded behind.
Why ar e they going?
People must have figur ed out a way to beat them.
Everyone has a weakness, right?
You didn' t think we' d make it through the night, did you?
Listen... ther e' s things I can take and a couple things I can' t.
One of them I can' t take is when my older brother, who' s everything I want to be... starts losing f aith in things.
I saw your eyes last night.
I don' t want to ever see your eyes like that again.
I' m serious.
He' s been like that f or a while.
He needs his medicine.
Have they said anything about our ar ea?
Philadelphia and its outlying counties ar e clear ed... but who knows f or sur e?
He' s not strong enough.
If he has another attack right now --
I know.
We' d have to be sur e bef or e we opened up that door, Graham.
It' s good enough f or me.
Me too.
We may need to give him an epinephrine shot.
-- People ar e celebrating.
-- They' r e dancing.
-- Yeah, like this.
-- Do you want to see it? -- we will be left with a lot of questions.
-- I' il bring the TV in her e.
We know the battle turned around in the Middle East.
Thr ee small cities ther e f ound a primitive method to def eat them.
We have no f urther details at this time.
Merrill, wait.
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, baby.
I was... just taking a walk bef or e dinner.
It was meant to be.
Does it hurt?
I don' t f eel much.
Good.
Tell Morgan... to play games.
It' s okay to be silly.
I will.
Tell Bo to listen to her brother.
He' il always take car e of her.
And tell Graham --
I' m her e.
Tell him... see.
Tell him to see.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
See, what you have to ask yourself is, what kind of person ar e you?
Ar e you the kind that sees signs, sees miracles?
Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
Is it possible... ther e ar e no coincidences?
Swing away, Merrill.
Merrill... swing away.
That' s why he had asthma.
It can' t be luck.
His lungs wer e closed.
No poison got in.
Give him a minute.
Don' t touch him.
What happened?
Did someone save me?
I found a paw print this morning and a cow has vanished.
That' s mine.
This is the third night in a row.
All the villagers are scared shitless.
A monster.
Yes. a big one.
Featuring Banlop Lomnoi & Sakda Kaewbuadee
Once upon a time. there was a powerful Khmer shaman. who could turn into various creatures.
He roamed the jungle and played tricks on villagers.
Excuse me. is anyone up there?
Who' s there?
What are you doing here?
I came to fetch you.
My mother has a high fever.
It' s dangerous.
Show me the way.
The hunter shot the tiger and trapped the shaman in the tiger spirit.
The tiger corpse is on display at Kanchanaburi Museum.
Now every night. the shaman' s spirit turns into a tiger to haunt travelers.
The villagers and their livestock have started to disappear.
HQ. do you copy?
HQ. do you copy?
As the tiger ghost tries to enter his dream. the soldier thinks about the missing villager.
The ghost is fascinated by the soldier' s mysterious sound device.
HQ. do you copy?
This is Ekarat.
Calling HQ.
Suddenly. a strange feeling gripped the soldier' s heart.
Soldier!
The tiger trails you like a shadow.
His spirit is starving and lonesome.
I see you are his prey and his companion.
He can smell you from mountains away.
And soon you will feel the same.
Kill him to free him from the ghost world.
Or let him devour you and enter his world.
Wait for me.
Once upon a time...
there was a powerful shaman who could turn into animals.
A creature whose life exists only by memories of other.
And now...
I see myself here.
My mother.
My father.
Fear.
Sadness.
It was all so real... so real that...
they brought me to life.
we are neither animal nor human.
Stop breathing.
I miss you... soldier.
Monster...
I give you my spirit. my flesh...
and my memories.
Every drop of my blood.
sings our song.
A song of happiness.
There...
Do you hear it?
Hi.
I' ve got an appointment with Mr. UIlman.
My name is Jack Torrance.
His office is the first door on the Ieft.
Thank you.
Mr. UIlman?
I' m Jack Torrance.
Come on in, Jack.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
This is my secretary, Susie.
- Susie, how do you do?
- Any trouble finding us?
No problem at aIl.
I made the trip in 3 1 / 2 hours.
That' s very good time.
Sit down a minute, Jack.
Just make yourself at home.
Like some coffee?
Thanks.
- Susie.
- Sure.
And ask BiII Watson to join us.
Yes, I wiIl.
Mom?
Yeah?
Do you reaIly want to go and Iive in that hoteI for the winter?
Sure I do.
It' II be Iots of fun.
I guess so.
Anyway, there' s hardly anybody to play with around here.
I know.
It always takes a Iittle time to make new friends.
Yeah, I guess so.
What about Tony?
He' s Iooking forward to the hotel, I bet.
No, I ain 't, Mrs. Torrance.
Don' t be siIly.
I don 't want to go there.
How come you don' t want to go?
I just don 't.
Did they give you any idea in Denver...... about what the job entails?
Only in a very generaI way.
The winters can be fantasticaIly cruel.
The basic idea is to cope with the very costly damage...... and depreciation which can occur.
This consists mainly of running the boiler...... heating different parts of the hoteI on a daily rotating basis...... repairing damage as it occurs...... and doing repairs so the elements can' t get a foothold.
That sounds fine to me.
PhysicaIly, it' s not a very demanding job.
The only thing that can get a bit trying here during the winter...... is a tremendous sense of isolation.
That just happens to be exactly what I' m Iooking for.
Five months of peace is just what I want.
That' s very good, Jack.
Because, for some people...... solitude...... and isolation...... can, of itself, become a problem.
Not for me.
Do you think they' II take to it?
They' II love it.
Great.
Before I turn you over to BiIl...... there' s one other thing I think we should talk about.
Not to sound melodramatic...... but it' s been known to give a few people...... second thoughts about the job.
I' m intrigued.
I don' t suppose they said anything in Denver...... about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970.
I don' t believe they did.
My predecessor in this job...... hired a man named Charles Grady as the winter caretaker.
He came up with his wife and 2 Iittle girls of about 8 and 10.
And from what I' ve been told, he seemed...... Iike a completely normaI individual.
But at some point during the winter...... he must have suffered some kind of a complete mentaI breakdown.
He ran amuck...
... and kiIled his family with an ax.
Stacked them neatly in a room in the west wing, and then...... he put both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth.
A kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur...... when people are shut in together over Iong periods of time.
That is...... quite a story.
Yeah, it is.
It' s stiII hard for me to believe it actuaIly happened here.
But it did.
I think you can appreciate why I wanted to teII you about it.
I certainly can.
I also understand why your people in Denver...... Ieft it for you to teII me.
Obviously, some people can be put off...... from staying in a place where something Iike that happened.
You can rest assured that' s not going to happen with me.
And as far as my wife is concerned...... I' m sure she' II be absolutely fascinated when I teII her.
She' s a confirmed ghost story...... and horror film addict.
Tony, do you think Dad' II get the job?
He already did.
He' s going to phone Wendy up in a few minutes to tell her.
- Hi, babe.
- Hi, hon.
How' s it going?
Great.
I' m at the hoteI and I stiII have a Iot to do.
I don' t think I can get home before 9 or 10.
Sounds Iike you got the job.
Right.
You and Danny are going to love it.
Tony, why don' t you want to go to the hotel?
I don 't know.
You do too know.
Now come on, teII me.
I don 't want to.
Please.
No.
Now, Tony, teII me.
We must reaIly be high up.
The air feels so different.
Dad?
I' m hungry.
You should' ve eaten your breakfast.
We' II get you something as soon as we get to the hotel.
Okay, Mom.
Wasn' t it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
I think that was farther west, in the Sierras.
What was the Donner party?
They were a party of settlers in covered wagon times.
They had to resort to cannibalism in order to stay alive.
You mean they ate each other up?
They had to, in order to survive.
Jack.
I know aII about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.
See, it' s okay.
He saw it on the television.
- What time does the plane Ieave?
That gives us plenty of time to go over everything.
- Goodbye, Mr. UIlman.
- Bye.
Good morning.
I hope you haven' t been waiting too Iong.
We had time to grab a bite to eat.
Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.
Is your family having a Iook around?
No, my son' s discovered the games room.
- Has your Iuggage been brought in?
- Right there.
In view of aII we have to cover today...... I suggest we have a quick Iook at your apartment and get started.
Have the Torrances' things brought to their apartment.
I' d better coIlect my family first.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
It' s beautiful.
My God!
This place is fantastic, isn' t it, hon?
It sure is.
This is the staff wing of the hotel.
None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
- Goodbye, Mr. UIlman.
- Goodbye, girls.
And here are your quarters.
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.
And a smaII bedroom for your son.
Perfect for a child.
When was the Overlook built?
It was finished in 1909.
They had to repeI a few Indian attacks as they were building it.
That' s our Snowcat.
Can you both drive a car?
That' s fine.
BasicaIly the Snowcat operates very much Iike a car.
It won' t take you Iong to get the hang of it.
This is the kitchen, huh?
This is it.
Is it big enough for you?
It' s the biggest place I ever seen.
This whole place is such an enormous maze.
I' II have to Ieave a traiI of breadcrumbs every time I come in.
Don' t Iet it get you down.
It' s big, but it ain' t nothing but a kitchen.
A Iot of this stuff you' II never have to touch.
I wouldn' t know what to do with it if I did.
One thing for sure, you don' t have to worry about food.
You could eat here for a year and never have the same menu twice.
Right here is our walk- in freezer.
This is where we keep aII of our meat.
We got 12 turkeys, about 40 chickens...... 50 sirloin steaks, two dozen pork roast...... and 20 Iegs of Iamb.
You Iike Iamb, Doc?
You don' t?
What' s your favorite food?
French fries and ketchup.
I think we can manage that too, Doc.
Come along.
Watch your step.
How' d you know we caII him Doc?
- Beg your pardon?
- You caIled Danny "Doc" twice.
I did?
We caII him Doc sometimes, Iike in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.
But how did you know?
I guess I heard you caII him that.
But I don' t remember...... caIling him that since we' ve been with you.
Anyway, he Iooks Iike a Doc, doesn' t he?
What' s up, Doc?
Now, this is the storeroom.
In here is where we keep aII the dried goods and the canned goods.
We got canned fruits and vegetables...... canned fish and meats, hot and cold cereals.
We got 60 boxes of dried milk...
How' d you like some ice cream, Doc?
... Sociables, finger roIls...... and 7 kinds of what have you.
We' ve got dried peaches, dried apricots...... dried raisins and dried prunes.
You know, you got to keep regular if you want to be happy.
- How' re you getting on?
- Fine.
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We' re on our way to the basement.
I promise we won' t keep her very Iong.
No problem.
I was just getting to the ice cream.
You Iike ice cream, Doc?
I thought so.
You mind if I give Danny some ice cream?
- Not at aIl.
- We don' t mind.
- Good.
- Sound good to you, Doc?
Okay, you behave yourself.
What kind of ice cream do you Iike?
Chocolate.
Chocolate it shaII be.
Come on, son.
It' s amazing, aII this activity today.
The guests and some staff Ieft yesterday, but the...... Iast day' s always hectic.
Everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
By 5: 00 tonight, you' II never know anybody was ever here.
Just Iike a ghost ship, huh?
Do you know how I knew your name was Doc?
You know what I' m talking about, don' t you?
I can remember when I was a Iittle boy...... my grandmother and I could hold conversations...... entirely without ever opening our mouths.
She caIled it "shining."
And for a Iong time I thought it was just the two of us...... that had "the shine" to us.
Like you probably thought you was the only one.
But there are other folks...... though mostly they don' t know it, or don' t believe it.
How Iong have you been able to do it?
Why don' t you want to talk about it?
I' m not supposed to.
Who says you ain' t supposed to?
Tony.
Who' s Tony?
Tony' s the Iittle boy that Iives in my mouth.
Is Tony the one that teIls you things?
How does he teII you things?
It' s Iike I go to sleep and he shows me things.
But when I wake up, I can' t remember everything.
Does your mom and dad know about Tony?
Do they know he teIls you things?
Tony told me never to teII them.
Has Tony ever told you anything about this place?
About the Overlook Hotel?
I don' t know.
Now think reaI hard, Doc.
Think.
Is there something bad here?
You know, Doc, when something happens...... it can Ieave a trace of itself behind.
Say, Iike...... if someone burns toast.
Maybe things that happen Ieave other kind of traces behind.
But things that people who shine can see.
Just Iike they can see things that haven' t happened yet...
... sometimes they can see things that happened a Iong time ago.
And not aII of them was good.
What about Room 237?
Room 237?
You' re scared of Room 237, ain' t you?
No, I ain' t.
Mr. HaIlorann, what is in Room 237?
There ain' t nothing in Room 237.
But you ain' t got no business going in there anyway.
So stay out.
You understand?
Stay out!
Good morning, hon.
Your breakfast is ready.
What time is it?
It' s about 11: 30.
Jesus!
I guess we' ve been staying up too Iate.
I know it.
I made them just the way you Iike them, sunny- side up.
Nice.
It' s reaIly pretty outside.
How about taking me for a walk after you finish your breakfast?
I suppose I ought to try to do some writing first.
Any ideas yet?
No good ones.
Something wiII come.
It' s just a matter of settling into the habit of writing every day.
That' s aII it is.
- AII right.
- And you' re going to Iose.
And I' m going to get you.
You' d better run fast!
Look out!
I' m coming in close.
Loser has to keep America clean.
Keep America clean.
Danny, you win.
Let' s take the rest of this walking.
Give me your hand.
Isn' t it beautiful?
Dead end.
We made it.
Isn' t it beautiful?
It' s so pretty.
Did you?
Hi, hon.
How' s it going?
Fine.
Get a Iot written today?
The weather forecast said it' s going to snow tonight.
What do you want me to do about it?
Don' t be so grouchy.
I' m not...... being grouchy.
I just want to finish my work.
Okay.
I understand.
I' II come back Iater with a couple of sandwiches.
Maybe you' II Iet me read something then.
When you come in and interrupt, you' re breaking my concentration.
You' re distracting me...... and it wiII then take time to get back to where I was.
Fine.
We' re making a new rule:
Whenever I' m in here...... and you hear me typing...
... or whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here...... when I' m in here, that means I am working.
That means don' t come in.
Do you think you can handle that?
Fine.
Why don' t you start right now and get the fuck out of here?
Missed!
Don' t have!
No fair anymore.
I knew it.
This is KDK 12 caIling KDK 1.
KDK 12 to KDK 1.
This is KDK 1.
Over.
This is Wendy Torrance at the Overlook Hotel.
How are you folks getting on up there?
Over.
But our telephones aren' t doing too weIl.
Are the Iines down, by any chance?
Over.
Over.
Any chance of them being repaired soon?
Wouldn' t Iike to say.
Most winters they stay that way untiI spring.
This storm is reaIly something, isn' t it?
Over.
It' s one of the worst we' ve had for years.
Anything else we can do for you, Mrs. Torrance?
Over.
If you folks have any problems up there, just give us a caIl.
And, Mrs. Torrance?
It might be a good idea if you leave your radio on all the time.
We' II do that.
It was reaI nice talking to you.
Over and out.
HeIlo, Danny.
Come and play with us.
Come and play with us, Danny.
Forever...
... and ever...... and ever.
Tony...... I' m scared.
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.
"It' s just like pictures in a book, Danny.
It isn 't real. "
Can I go to my room and get my fire engine?
Come here for a minute first.
How' s it going, Doc?
Having a good time?
Yes, Dad.
Good.
I want you to have a good time.
I am, Dad.
Do you feeI bad?
I' m just a Iittle bit tired.
Then why don' t you go to sleep?
I can' t.
I got too much to do.
Do you Iike this hotel?
I do.
I love it.
Don' t you?
I guess so.
Good.
I want you to Iike it here.
I wish we could stay here forever...... and ever...... and ever.
What?
You would never hurt Mommy or me, would you?
What do you mean?
Did your mother ever say that to you?
That I would hurt you?
No, Dad.
You sure?
Yes, Dad.
I love you, Danny.
I would never do anything to hurt you...... never.
You know that, don' t you?
Yes, Dad.
Good.
Mom, are you in there?
What happened?
Honey...... what' s wrong?
I had the most...... terrible nightmare I ever had.
- It was the most horrible dream.
- It' s okay now.
ReaIly.
I dreamed that I...... that I kiIled you and Danny.
But I didn' t just kiII you.
I cut you up into Iittle pieces.
My God.
I must be Iosing my mind.
Everything' s going to be aII right.
Let' s get up off the floor.
There.
Now sit up.
It' s okay.
It' s okay.
Danny!
Everything' s okay!
Just go play in your room for a while.
Your dad' s just got a headache.
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.
Honey, Iet me just get him out of here.
I' II be right back.
Why don' t you mind me?
Oh, my God.
What happened to your neck?
What happened to your neck?
You did this to him...... didn' t you?!
You son of a bitch!
You did this to him!
Didn' t you?!
How could you?!
How could you?!
I' d give anything for a drink.
I' d give my goddamn soul...... for just a glass of beer.
Hi, Lloyd.
A Iittle slow tonight, isn' t it?
Yes it is, Mr. Torrance.
What wiII it be?
I was afraid they' d be there untiI next April.
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...... a Iittle glass and some ice.
You can do that, can' t you?
You' re not too busy, are you?
I' m not busy at aIl.
Good man.
You set them up...... and I' II knock them back, one by one.
White man' s burden.
Say, Lloyd...... it seems I' m temporarily Iight.
How' s my credit in this joint, anyway?
Your credit' s fine, Mr. Torrance.
That' s sweIl.
I Iike you, Lloyd.
I always Iiked you.
Best goddamn bartender...... from Timbuktu to Portland, Maine.
Or Portland, Oregon, for that matter.
Thank you for saying so.
I never Iaid a hand on him, goddamn it.
I didn' t.
I wouldn' t touch one hair on his goddamn Iittle head.
I love the Iittle son of a bitch.
I' d do anything for him.
Any fucking thing for him.
But that bitch!
As Iong as I Iive...... she' II never Iet me forget what happened.
I did hurt him once, okay?
It was an accident.
Completely unintentional.
Have you got any biscuits over there?
Here' s some cornbread.
I am cold.
- Still with us, Brett?
- Right.
- Oh, I feel dead.
- Anybody ever tell you you "look" dead?
Oh, yeah.
Right!
Before we dock, I think we ought to discuss the bonus situation.
Brett and I, we think we deserve full shares.
Mr Parker and I feel the bonus situation has never been on an equitable level.
You get what you' re contracted for, like everybody else.
Yes, but everybody else gets more than us.
Dallas, Mother wants to talk to you.
Yeah, I saw it.
Yellow light' s for my eyes only.
OK, get dressed, huh?
Parker?
I haven' t finished my coffee.
It' s the only thing good on this ship.
Morning, Mother.
- Right?
- OK.
Plug us in.
Thank you.
- Where is Earth?
- You should know.
It' s not our system.
Scan.
I can' t believe this.
Contact traffic control.
This is commercial towing vehicle "Nostromo", out of the Solomons, registration number 180924609, calling Antarctica traffic control.
Do you read me?
Over.
Commercial towing vehicle Nostromo, out of the Solomons.
Registration number 180924609.
- Nothing.
- Keep trying.
Calling Antarctica traffic control.
Do you read me, Antarctica?
Over.
I' ve found it, just short of Zeta II Reticuli.
We haven' t reached the outer rim yet.
That' s hard to believe.
What the hell are we doing out here?
Don' t know.
What the hell are you talking about?
That' s not our system.
I know that.
Do you ever notice how they never come down here?
This is where the work is, right?
Same reason we get a half share to their one.
Our time is their time.
Same old shit, man.
I think I know why they don' t come down.
It' s because of you.
You have no personality.
- You happen to be in my seat.
Can I have it?
- Yes.
Of course.
Sorry.
What' s happening now, baby?
Well, some of you may have figured out we' re not home yet.
We' re only halfway there.
- What?
- Mother' s interrupted ourjourney course.
Why?
She' s programmed to do that should certain conditions arise.
They have.
It seems she has intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
- She got us up to check it out.
- A transmission?
Out here?
What kind of a transmission?
Acoustical beacon that repeats at intervals of 12 seconds.
- SOS?
- I don' t know.
- Human?
- Unknown.
- So what?
- We are obligated under Section...
I hate to bring this up, but this is a commercial ship, not a rescue ship.
- Right.
- It' s not in my contract, this kind of duty.
And what about the money?
If you wanna give me some money, I' d be happy to oblige.
Let' s go over the bonus situation.
I' m sorry, can I say something?
There is a clause which states "Any systematised transmission indicating intelligent origin must be investigated...
I wanna go home and party.
Parker, will you just listen to the man?
.. on penalty of total forfeiture of shares. "
No money.
- Well, yeah!
- We' re going in.
Yeah.
- Good God.
What was the position?
Well, that' s it.
- Any rotation?
0. 86.
Approaching orbital apogee.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
DOR' s in line.
- Status on the lifters?
- Give me an AC pressure reading.
48 seconds and counting.
Prepare to disengage from platform.
20 seconds.
18, 17... 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, lock.
Disengage.
Clear.
Money' s safe.
Let' s take her down.
- Roll 92 degrees, port yaw.
- Prime the port.
I' m not getting anything.
Turbulence.
Locked and floating.
You can drop us any time now.
Initial damping' s going off.
Hold on, people, there' s going to be a little bump.
What the hell was that?
Pressure drop.
Must have lost a shield.
Let' s go with it.
I' m still not getting anything.
Yeah.
Dropping off now.
Still dropping.
There we are, we' ve got it.
Take her down.
Navigation lights on.
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Kill drive engines.
What the hell happened?
- Somebody give me an answer!
- Is the hull breached?
I don' t see anything.
We still have pressure.
- Push the screen.
- Why?
Secondary load- sharing unit is out.
Three of the four cells are gone.
- Is that it?
- No, hold on.
We can' t fix it out here anyway and we need to reroute a couple of these ducts.
Dry- dock time.
Dry- dock.
Tell him to dry- dock!
We couldn' t fix it out here anyway.
We' ve gotta reroute all these ducts.
In order to do that, we' ve got to dry- dock.
What else?
Some fragments caked up.
We' ve got to clean it out and repressurise it.
How long before we' re functional?
- Look...
- 17 hours, tell her.
At least 25 hours.
Get started.
I' il be right down.
- What the hell' s she coming down here for?
- She better stay the fuck out of my way.
Any response yet?
No, absolutely nothing, except the same transmission every 12 seconds.
All the other channels are dead.
Kick on the floods.
We can' t go anywhere in this.
Mother says the sun rises in 20 minutes.
- How far to the source of transmission?
- Northeast.
Walking distance?
- Can you give me an atmospheric?
- Yes.
It' s almost primordial.
There' s inert nitrogen, high concentration of carbon dioxide crystals, methane...
- I' m working on the trace elements.
- Anything else?
Yes.
There' s rock, lava base.
Deep cold, well below the line.
I' il volunteer to be in the first group to go out.
- You, too, Lambert.
- Swell.
You' d better break out the weapons.
- I can' t see a goddamn thing!
- Ash, are you receiving?
Good contact on my board.
Clear and free.
Keep the line open.
Let' s go.
Hey, Ripley.
Hey, Ripley, I want to ask you a question.
If they find what they' re looking for, do we get full shares?
Don' t worry, Parker, you' il get whatever' s coming to you.
I' m not gonna do any more work until we get this straightened out.
Brett, you' re guaranteed by law to get a share.
- What?
- Why don' t you just fuck off?
- What?
- What did you say, Rip?
If you have any trouble, I' il be on the bridge.
Hey, Ripley, come back here!
- Son of a bitch.
- What' s the matter?
Can' t see a goddamn thing.
Quit griping.
- I like griping.
- Come on, knock it off.
- Ash, can you see this?
- Yes, I can.
I' ve never seen anything like it.
It' s very bizarre.
You said it.
All right.
Moving on to second... position.
What is it?
Let' s get outta here.
We must go on.
We have to go on.
Will you say that again?
Shit!
Ash, as you can see, it' s hard to describe.
I' m going back to the console.
Come on down here.
There' s something different here.
I don' t know what it is, but if we can get up that wall, we can find out.
Alien life form.
It looks like it' s been dead a long time.
Fossilised.
Looks like it' s grown out of the chair.
Bones are bent outward.
Like he exploded from inside.
I wonder what happened to the rest of the crew.
Let' s get the hell outta here.
Dallas!
Lambert!
Come on over here!
Come on.
- What have you got?
- See what you make of this.
It doesn' t look like an SOS.
Well, I...
It looks like a warning.
- I' m gonna go out after them.
- What' s the point?
Yes?
Are you OK down there?
- Can you see anything?
- I don' t know...
A cave.
I don' t know, but it' s like the goddamn tropics in here.
What the hell is this?
The pit is completely enclosed.
And it' s full of leathery objects, like eggs or something.
There' s a layer of mist covering the eggs that reacts when broken.
Kane?
Are you all right?
Yeah, I' m OK.
I' m OK, I just slipped.
It appears to be completely sealed.
Wait a minute, there' s movement.
It seems to have life.
Organic life.
- Are you there, Ripley?
- I' m right here.
- OK, Ripley.
I' m at the inner lock hatch.
- Right.
Are you there, Ripley?
We' re clean, let us in.
- What happened to Kane?
- Something attached itself to him.
What kind of thing?
An organism.
Open the hatch!
If we let it in, the ship could be infected.
You know the quarantine procedure.
- 24 hours for decontamination.
- He could die.
Open the hatch.
Listen to me.
We break quarantine, we could all die.
Could you open the goddamn hatch?
We have to get him inside!
No.
I can' t, and if you were in my position you' d do the same.
Ripley, this is an order.
Open that hatch, do you hear me?
- Yes.
- Ripley, this is an order!
Jesus Christ.
What is that, man?
- He still alive or what?
And why don' t you guys freeze him?
How come they don' t freeze him?
What' s going on in there?
- You bitch!
How are we gonna get that off of him?
- How are we gonna get it off?
- Just a minute!
I' il get some instruments.
Right.
Now, if I make an incision here to try and remove one of the digits from his face...
You' re gonna do what?
Finger.
I' il try and get this finger off.
Get this cleating on there...
- It' s tearing his scalp!
- I know!
It' s not coming off without tearing his face off with it.
We' il have to take a look at him inside.
How come they don' t freeze him?
How come you guys don' t freeze him?
You can take your mask off.
- What' s it got down his throat?
- I would suggest it' s feeding him oxygen.
Paralyses him, puts him in a coma, then keeps him alive.
What the hell is that?
- We' ve got to get it off him.
- Just a minute.
Let' s not be too hasty.
We don' t know anything about... it.
We' re assuming it' s feeding him oxygen.
If we remove it, it could kill him.
I' il take that chance.
Let' s cut it off him now.
- You take responsibility?
- Yes, yes.
Get him out of there.
Where do you want to do this?
We' il make an incision just below the knuckle there.
- Right here?
Good God!
That crap' s gonna eat through the hull.
I think it' s going to eat through the goddamn hull.
Come on!
What' s going on?
This way.
Next deck.
There it is.
Don' t get under it!
Looks like it' s stopping.
Take a look at this, man.
Brett, give me your pen.
Give it to me, quick.
Come on, come on!
Don' t get any on your arm.
It' s stopped.
I haven' t seen anything like that, except molecular acid.
It must be using it for blood.
It' s got a wonderful defence mechanism.
You don' t dare kill it.
What about Kane?
Here' s your pen back.
- What do we do now?
- Leave Kane to Ash.
You get back to work.
Oh...
What...?
OK.
Try it.
- Damn it.
I felt sure that was it.
- Try it again.
Feel like I' ve been in this place a month.
We shouldn' t have landed here in the first place.
We shouldn' t have landed on this damn ball, I know that.
The sooner we patch this thing up and get outta here, the sooner we can go home.
This place gives me the creeps.
It' s amazing.
What is it?
I' d say it' s, um...
I don' t know yet.
- Do you want something?
- Yes, I, uh...
How' s Kane?
He' s holding.
No changes.
And, uh, our guest?
Well, as I said, I' m still collating, actually.
But I have confirmed that he' s got an outer layer of protein polysaccharides.
He has a funny habit of shedding his cells and replacing them with polarised silicone, which gives him a prolonged resistance to adverse environmental conditions.
Is that enough?
What does it mean?
- Please don' t do that.
Thank you.
- I' m sorry.
It' s an interesting combination of elements, making him a... tough little son of a bitch.
And you let him in.
I was obeying a direct order, remember?
Ash, when Dallas and Kane are off the ship, I' m senior officer.
Oh, yes.
I forgot.
You also forgot the Science Division' s basic quarantine law.
- No, that I didn' t forget.
- Oh, I see.
You just broke it.
What would you have done with Kane?
Hm?
You knew his only chance of survival was to get him in here.
Unfortunately, by breaking quarantine, you risk everybody' s life.
Maybe I should have left him outside.
Maybe I' ve jeopardised the rest of us, but it was a risk I was willing to take.
It' s a pretty big risk for a science officer.
It' s not exactly out of the manual, is it?
I do take my responsibilities as seriously as you.
You do yourjob and let me do mine.
Yes?
- Where' s Dallas?
- In the shuttle.
- Why?
- Something' s happened.
- Serious?
- Interesting.
Ripley, meet me in the infirmary right away.
- Where is it?
- Well, I don' t know!
- We have to try and find it.
- Let' s check it.
Dallas, please be careful.
Sorry.
No, not in the corner!
Have one of these.
Just in case.
Kane?
Are you OK?
- I didn' t see it.
Was it in the overhead?
- It was up there somewhere.
- My God.
- Cover the damn thing, will you?
It' s alive.
We' ve got to have a look at this.
Excuse me.
- It seems dead enough.
Let' s get rid of it.
Ripley, for God' s sake, this is the first time we' ve encountered a species like this.
It has to go back.
All sorts of tests have to be made.
Ash, are you kidding?
This thing bled acid.
Who knows what it will do when it' s dead?
I think it' s safe to assume it isn' t a zombie.
Dallas, it has to go back.
I' d soon as not burn it at the stake, but you' re the science officer.
- It' s your decision, Ash.
- Dallas!
- You won' t make me change my mind...
- I' m not trying to change your mind.
I just want you to listen...
Will you listen?
- How can you leave that decision to him?
- I just run the ship.
Anything scientific, Ash has the final word.
- How does that happen?
- That' s what the company wants.
- Since when is that standard procedure?
- Standard procedure is to do what they say.
- What' s happening with the repairs?
- They' re pretty much finished.
- Why didn' t you tell me?
- There' s still some things to do.
We' re blind on B and C decks, the reserve power system' s blown...
That' s horseshit.
We can take off without that.
- We can.
You think that' s a good idea?
- Look, I just wanna get the hell outta here.
Dust in the intakes.
Number two' s overheating.
Spit on it for two minutes, for Christ sake!
We' re hot and we' re getting hotter.
Engine room, red clip status.
- One kilometre on ascension.
- Engage artificial gravity.
- Engaged.
- I' m altering the vector... now.
Inhibit CNG.
- Struts retract.
- Struts retracted.
Walk in the park!
When we fix something, it stays fixed.
Don' t we, Brett, baby?
Right!
We should freeze him.
If he' s got a disease, why don' t we stop it there?
- We can get to a doctor back home.
- Right.
Whenever he says "anything," you say "Right", Brett, you know?
Right.
Parker, your staffjust follows you around and says "Right"!
Just like a parrot.
- Shape up!
What are you, a parrot?
- Right.
Come on, knock it off!
- Kane' s gonna have to go into quarantine.
- Yes, and so are we.
- How about something to lower your spirits?
- Thrill me, will you, please?
According to my calculations, based on time spent...
- Give me the short version.
How far to Earth?
- Ten months.
Oh, God.
Yes?
- Dallas, I think you should see Kane.
- Has his condition changed?
- It' s simpler if you come.
- We' re on our way.
Right.
How are you feelin '?
- How are you doing?
- Terrific!
Next silly question?
Oh, thank you.
Do you remember anything about the planet?
What' s the last thing you do remember?
I remember some horrible dream about smothering and...
Anyway, where are we?
- Right here!
- We' re on our way home.
Back to the old freezerinos!
- I' ve got to have something to eat first.
- I need something to eat myself.
One more meal before bedtime.
I' m buying.
Hey, that' s a break!
The first thing I' m going to do when I get back is to get some decent food.
I can dig it.
I' ve eaten worse food than this, but then I' ve tasted better.
You pound down the stuff like there' s no tomorrow.
I' d rather be eating something else, but right now, I' m thinking food.
You should know, you know what it' s made of.
I don' t wanna talk about what it' s made of.
I' m eating this!
What' s the matter, man?
The food ain' t that bad, baby!
What' s wrong?
What?
What?
- Kane!
Get the spoon!
- Get it into his mouth!
- I' m trying!
Oh, God!
- Dallas?
- Yeah.
- Anything?
- No.
You?
Nothing.
- Did you see anything?
- No.
Inner hatch sealed.
Anybody want to say anything?
This is just an ordinary prod, like a cattle prod.
It' s got a portable battery.
It' s insulated from here to here.
Just make damn sure nobody puts their hand on the end of it.
It shouldn' t damage the bastard unless its skin is thinner than ours.
But it will give him a little incentive.
Now we just have to find him.
I' ve taken care of that.
I' ve designed this tracking device.
You just set it to search for a moving object.
Hasn' t got much of a range, but within a certain distance, it gives off a signal.
What does it key on?
Micro changes in air density.
Gimme a demo.
See?
And again...
Gotcha.
Two teams.
Ash, Lambert and I. Ripley, you take Parker and Brett.
Catch it, put it in the airlock, get rid of it.
The channels are open on all decks.
I want you to communicate, keep in touch at all times.
Let' s go.
I thought you fixed 12 module.
We did.
I don' t understand it.
The circuits must have burned out.
- What have we got here?
- Damn it, hold your light over here.
Yeah, that' s it.
I don' t know if this is going to work.
- Put this in there.
- Right.
Check the insulation.
Shit...
According to this, it' s within five metres.
Micro changes in air density, my ass.
It' s within five metres.
Be careful.
- Hey, don' t creep up on me with that thing.
- You guys stick together.
- Whoa, whoa now...
- What?
Parker, Brett, it' s in this locker.
In where?
Here, take it.
I got it, I got it.
Wait.
All right, Parker?
When I say.
- All right.
- Easy.
- Don' t let him go!
- What the hell are you doing, man?!
It' s the cat.
Hey, look, now.
We had to bag it.
Now we might pick it up on the tracker again.
I' Il...
- Go and get it, man.
You get him, we' il go on.
Here, kitty!
Here, kitty, kitty.
Kitty crap.
Jones!
Jonesy?
Here, Jonesy!
Jonesy?
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, Jonesy!
Jonesy?
Here, kitty, kitty.
Kitty, kitty, kitty.
Jonesy.
Kitty, kitty.
Kitty, kitty, kitty.
Jonesy?
Hey.
Hey, come on, Jonesy.
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.
Hey, I' m not gonna hurt you.
Brett!
Brett!
Whatever it was, it was big.
No question.
It' s...
It' s using the air ducts to move around.
Could he want Brett alive?
- What?
No.
I mean, I...
I don' t think so.
Now, this air shaft may work to our advantage.
It leads up to and comes out in the main airlock.
There' s only one big opening along the way.
We can cover that up and then we drive it into the airlock and zap it into outer space.
The son of a bitch is "huge!"
I mean, it' s like a man.
It' s big!
Kane' s son.
Come on, Ash.
The science department should be able to help.
How can we drive it?
It' s adapted well to our atmosphere, considering its nutritional needs.
But we don' t know about temperature.
- OK, temperature.
What if we change it?
- Let' s try it.
Most animals retreat from fire.
Fire, yeah.
Parker, can you rig three or four incinerator units?
- Who gets to go into the vent?
- I do.
No.
You and Ash, take the main airlock.
Parker, Lambert, you cover up that maintenance opening, please.
- I' m at the firstjunction.
- Dallas, I' m right here.
- Parker?
- Yeah.
- Lambert?
- In position.
I' m trying to get a reading.
- The airlock is open.
- OK, Ripley.
Ready.
All right, I' ve got a reading on you now.
Open the hatch to the third junction.
OK, I' m through.
I' m moving on.
Dallas, hold on.
I think I got it.
- Yes, I' ve got it.
- Where?
It' s somewhere around the third junction.
OK.
Moving on.
It is right around there.
Dallas, you' re gonna have to be careful.
All right.
I' ve reached the third junction and I' m going down.
What the hell' s the matter with that box?
Dallas, hold your position for a minute.
I...
- I' ve lost the signal!
- What?
You sure?
Are you sure it' s not there?
It' s got to be around there.
Check that out, Lambert.
You may be getting interference.
Dallas, are you sure there' s no sign of it?
It is there!
It' s gotta be around there!
Dallas?
All right.
Am I clear?
I wanna get the hell outta here.
Oh, God!
It' s moving right towards you.
Move!
Get out of there!
Move!
Dallas!
Move, Dallas!
Move, Dallas.
Get out!
No!
Not that way!
The other way!
Dallas?
- No.
- Take it easy.
Dallas!
We found this laying there.
No blood.
No Dallas.
Nothing.
- I don' t hear anybody sayin 'nothing.
- I' m thinking.
Unless somebody has got a better idea, we' il proceed with Dallas' s plan.
What?!
And end up like the others?
Oh, no.
You' re out of your mind!
- You got a better idea?
- Yes.
I say that we abandon the ship.
We get the shuttle and get the hell out of here, and hope somebody picks us up.
Lambert, shh.
- The shuttle won' t take four.
- Then why don' t we draw straws?
I' m not drawing any straws.
I' m for killing it now!
Let' s talk about killing it.
It' s in the air shafts...
Will you listen to me, Parker?
Shut up!
Let' s hear it.
Let' s hear it.
- It' s using the air shafts.
- We don' t know that...
That' s the only way!
We' il move in pairs.
We' il go step by step and cut off every bulkhead and vent until we have it cornered, then we' il blow it the fuck out into space.
Is that acceptable to you?
If it means killing it, yeah.
But we have to stick together.
- How are our weapons?
- The weapons are fine.
This one needs refuelling.
Will you get it, please?
- Ash, go with him.
- No, I can manage, Ash.
Don' t follow me.
Ash!
Any suggestions from you or Mother?
No.
We' re still collating.
You' re what?
You' re still collating?
I find that hard to believe.
- What would you like me to do?
- Just what you' ve been doing, Ash.
Nothing.
I' ve got access to Mother now, and I' il get my own answers, thank you.
All right.
There is an explanation for this, you know.
I don' t wanna hear your goddamn explanation!
Parker.
Lambert?
Ash!
Will you open the door?
Let me by, Ash.
What the hell are you doing?
Get her up!
Get her up, get her up!
It' s an android!
Jesus...
It' s a robot!
Ash is a goddamn robot.
God!
Holy shit!
Help me get this fucking thing off!
Oh, Jesus...
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
How come the company sent us a goddamn robot?
They must have wanted the alien for the weapons division.
He' s been protecting it right along.
- Parker, will you plug it in?
I don' t know...
Because he may know how to kill it.
Ash, can you hear me?
Yes, I can hear you.
What was your special order?
You read it.
I thought it was clear.
- What was it?
- Bring back life form, priority one.
All other priorities rescinded.
The damn company!
What about our lives, you son of a bitch?!
I repeat, all other priorities are rescinded.
How do we kill it, Ash?
There' s gotta be a way of killing it.
- How do we do it?
- You can' t.
That' s bullshit!
You still don' t understand what you' re dealing with, do you?
The perfect organism.
Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility.
You admire it.
I admire its purity.
A survivor, unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.
Look, I' ve heard enough of this and I' m asking you to pull the plug.
Last word.
I can' t lie to you about your chances, but... you have my sympathies.
We' re gonna blow up the ship.
We' il take our chances in the shuttle.
- Blow up the ship.
- Good.
Come on.
When we throw the switches, how long do we have?
- Ten minutes.
- No bullshit.
Or else we won' t need no rocket to fly through space.
We' il need coolant for the air support system.
You two go down and get all the coolant you can carry.
I' il get the shuttle ready.
I' il give you about... about seven minutes.
Come back up here, I' il shut the switches off and we' il blow this fucker off into space.
- Ready?
- Take care of yourself.
Seven minutes.
Take it easy.
Jones?
Jones?
OK, check the bottles.
Jones?
- How are you doing?
- Fine.
OK, go ahead.
Jones?
Kitty, kitty, kitty.
Come here, Jones, come here.
Jones.
Come here, boy.
Come here.
Nice kitty.
Jones?
Jones?
Come here.
Come here, sweetheart.
Jones.
Jones.
Jones.
Jones.
Jones!
Goddamn it.
Now I' ve got you.
Come on, sweetheart.
Nice kitty.
Oh, my God...
- Get out of the way!
- I can' t.
It' s gonna kill us!
I can' t!
- For Christ sake, get out of the way!
Lambert...
Get out of the way, Lambert!
Lambert!
Lambert...
Parker...
Parker?
Danger.
The emergency destruct system is now activated.
The ship will detonate in T minus ten minutes.
Kill me.
The option to override automatic detonation expires in T minus three minutes.
The option to override automatic detonation expires in T minus one minute.
29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20 seconds.

The option to override detonation procedure has now expired.
Mother!
I' ve turned the cooling unit back on!
Mother!
The ship will automatically destruct in T minus five minutes.
You bitch!
Goddamn it!
Jones.
You now have one minute to abandon ship.
The ship will automatically destruct in T minus one minute.
27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20 seconds.

9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
I got you, you son of a bitch.
It' s all right.
All right, it' s nice to see you, too.
It' s OK.
Come on.
You are my...
lucky star.
You...
OK.
You are... my lucky star...
You...
.. my lucky star...
You are my lucky star...
You are my lucky...
You... are my lucky star...
Final report of the commercial starship "Nostromo".
Third Officer reporting.
The other members of the crew -
Kane,
Lambert, Parker, Brett, Ash and Captain Dallas - are dead.
Cargo and ship destroyed.
I should reach the frontier in about six weeks.
With a little luck, the network will pick me up.
This is Ripley, last survivor of the "Nostromo", signing off.
Come on, cat.

- Good sleep?
- Not bad.
So where are we?
Where you from?
San Diego.
Left yesterday.
So you came Honolulu- Guam- Pago- here?
Long trip.
What do you do?
l’ m a psychologist.
Hey, a shrink.
They’ ve called in everything else.
How do you mean?
We’ ve ferried people out of Guam for the last 2 days.
Physicists, biologists, mathematicians, you name it.
Everybody being flown to the middle of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean.
What’ s going on?
They’ re not telling us anything, sir.
What did they tell you?
There was a plane crash.
Do you get called in on crashes?
l’ m on a list of psychologists the FAA brings in when a plane goes down.
So where exactly are we now?
That’ s where we’ re headed.
Over there.
Here.
Take a look.
What is that?
All that for a plane crash?
I never mentioned a plane crash.
- Any other gear?
Watch your step.
- l’ d like to call my family.
We’ il get you settled in quarters first.
Remain there till we send for you.
- l’ d like to get started.
- We’ il send for you.
- lt’ s critical I see them -- - Who?
The survivors. lf I don’ t get to them in the first 24 hours --
- What survivors?
- The survivors of the plane crash.
Plane crash?
I deal in post- traumatic stress and survival guilt.
Maybe I should talk to someone who knows what’ s going on here.
- Talk to the ship’ s psychiatrist.
- l’ m a psychologist.
That’ s why I was sent here.
I told you people I need a phone.
Discuss that with Mr. Barnes.
That’ s fine.
Give me a phone, l’ il call him.
Why are you here?
Take your hands off me, please.
Do you have any idea who I am?
Tell him the name of the book you wrote.
Astrophysics You Can Use.
It was a Book- of- the- Month Club Main Selection.
Never heard of it.
You really thought he read your book.
You haven’ t changed.
It was written for the layman.
He’ s not impressed.
ls there a phone in here?
- l’ ve been trying to call my wife.
- Would you stop touching me?
Wait a minute.
Beth?
Flight quarters.
All units make your flight quarters...... condition one stations for landing.
Stay clear of the fantail --
Goodman, you been here long?
- l’ ve been here 3 hours.
- Welcome aboard.
This thing scares the hell out of me.
lt’ s already too late.
You might as well helicopter me back...... because the damage is done to the survivors already.
- Hold on.
We’ il get to that.
- I don’ t even know who you are.
I know who you are.
Who are you?
Military?
What are you?
You ever hear of the OSSA?
They don’ t know who I am.
That should reassure you.
You haven’ t talked to anyone about this?
- I talked to the helicopter pilot.
- What’ d you tell him?
I told him I was here to see the plane crash.
That’ s my job.
Plane crash.
Good.
There was no plane crash.
Spacecraft.
A spacecraft.
I guess that explains a lot.
- NASA?
- That doesn’ t surprise you?
At least it explains the secrecy.
The secrecy’ s critical, Norman.
You made that explicit in your report.
What report?
ULF.
I wrote that for the Bush administration.
And that’ s our bible here.
But that was a report about a possible encounter with an alien being.
You want to come with me?
Oh, boy.
About 3 weeks ago...... a ship laying fiber- optic cable between Honolulu and Sydney...... hit an obstruction 1, 000 feet underwater.
Cut this cable here clean as a shears.
The Navy got interested, sent out a search ship.
It turned out that what did it...... was this.
We took this with side- looking sonar.
This is an aerodynamic fin longer than a football field...... bigger than any known wingspan.
This is the fuselage.
This is ultrahigh- res SLS bottom scan.
Came in a week ago.
There it is, buried under about 8 yards of coral.
Something’ s wrong with that measurement.
You can set your watch by it.
That’ s right.
So you’ re saying this spacecraft crashed in the year....
1709.
So you’ re saying this spacecraft crashed 300 years ago?
288.
That’ s impossible.
lt’ s not impossible if this spacecraft came from an alien civilization.
Wait a minute.
You think this is an alien spacecraft?
lt’ s not impossible.
lt’ s ridiculous.
We think there’ s an Unknown Life Form on the spacecraft.
That’ s why you’ re here.
You are the contact team that was recommended in the Goodman Report.
We have a biochemist...... to assess the physiology of the Unknown Life Form.
A mathematician, because that’ il probably be our common language.
And we have an astrophysicist to locate its place in the cosmos.
- Led by a psychologist.
- Right.
Nowadays, the little green men say, ’ ’ Take me to your therapist ’ ’?
Listen up.
’ ’ Contact teams meeting an Unknown Life Form or ULF...... must be prepared for severe psychological impact.
Stress reaction of confronting such life has not been sufficiently studied...... and cannot be entirely predicted in advance.
But the most likely consequence of contact is...... absolute terror. ’ ’
That’ s from Norman’ s report.
l’ m sorry, are these parameters correct?
You’ re saying that you have a spacecraft over a half a mile long...... that crashed into the ocean 300 years ago and it’ s completely intact?
That’ s right.
And the kicker is, our sonar is picking up a low- level hum.
Something’ s still running inside.
There’ s no way this coral could’ ve grown faster than an inch a year?
That’ s what we’ re going there to see.
Who says?
Harry, that’ s a joke, right?
This is the greatest scientific discovery since Copernicus.
Bigger!
The idea that we’ re not alone, it’ il change everything.
Evidence of extraterrestrial life.
You don’ t want to see that?
I got to say that I resent this briefing very much.
And how’ s that?
lf Norman’ s report calls for a biologist, a mathematician...... an astrophysicist and a psychologist...... why are you here?
Physical protocols start in a half an hour.
You always wear glasses?
I just started wearing these.
Are the glasses a problem?
I don’ t actually need them.
They’ re just for reading.
And they’ re more of a crutch.
I see fine without them.
But they didn’ t anticipate l’ d be going 1, 000 feet under the water.
Do you take prescription medication?
No.
None at all?
Once in a while sometimes I might take like a...... a piece of Xanax or something if l’ m nervous.
Something like that.
But not...... much.
Knee surgery.
Complete reconstruction of ACL, right knee.
Still have steel pin here, steel pin here, little medial collateral damage.
I see that you have a scar on your neck.
Car accident.
- Were you drinking?
- Yeah.
But I wasn’ t driving.
Wait, I just want to apologize for putting your name on the list.
Why?
When I made the report a few years ago, I picked names of people I knew.
And?
I know Ted because of his father.
- Yeah, so what?
- Beth was a patient.
lt’ s a bogus report.
What?
Did you tell Barnes?
You can’ t do that.
That’ s fraud.
They came to me, new administration, right?
Political agenda.
They said, in case of an alien invasion, do’ s and don’ ts.
Why didn’ t you just say no?
$35, 000.
It paid the down payment on my house.
New administration wanted to prove they’ re doing something new.
How’ d you come up with this team...... of a biologist, an astrophysicist and a mathematician?
Right.
- How?
- I don’ t know.
It sounded good, right?
Made them come to me.
I forgive you, Norman.
I forgive you!
But I don’ t forgive you for Ted.
He’ s a pain in the ass.
l’ il talk to him.
We’ il be there 2 hours.
You don’ t have to be around him.
He idolizes you anyways, but l’ il talk to him. l’ il buy you dinner.
- l’ m sorry.
- Your secret’ s safe with me.
Come on.
l can’ t believe this thing could....
Like a dream.
Have you called your wife?
Why not?
This’ il be a saturation dive.
You’ il be going to a habitat in 1, 000 feet of water.
A sub will take you to the Habitat and you’ il transfer aboard.
At 1, 000 feet, your body will be pressurized for that depth.
The pressure wouldn’ t bother you.
Although I wouldn’ t recommend it because the water’ s so cold...... you’ d freeze to death in less than 2 minutes.
That’ s the reason for the diving suits.
Your helmet has a rebreather for your air supply.
Following this briefing, l’ il take you to an onboard dive tank.
For the next 8 hours...... you’ il train in deep- saturation dive techniques and emergency procedures.
Once you’ ve gone down 1, 000 feet...... if you surface, you’ il have to commit to several days of decompression.
There is no real quick return.
However, there is a mini- sub...... that may be used as an emergency escape vehicle.
But there must be a ship at the surface to mate to for decompression.
Without decompression, your body would literally burst.
Under these circumstances, you’ re very well- controlled.
The dive has been planned well and professionally monitored.
The descent will take about 13 minutes, descending at 80 feet a minute.
lt’ s going to get chilly.
Try to relax.
Next time, just tell us when you’ re going to push the button.
Mozart...... Horn Concerto in E- flat...... K- 447.
How you holding up, Captain Nautical?
- l’ m loose.
- You’ re loose?
l’ m loose. l’ m loose.
l’ m uptight.
- We okay?
- We’ re in the river now.
What river?
It flows like a river inside the ocean.
- Under the ocean and there’ s a river.
- That’ s right.
You okay?
Right now, l’ m not okay.
Would you please not touch me?
We’ re both nervous.
Yes?
Would you cut that out, please?
You’ re having a stress reaction.
That’ s Harry’ s stress reaction.
Those noises we’ re hearing, that’ s normal?
Those noises are the water pressure attacking the sub’ s integrity.
You know a little something about that, don’ t you, Norman?
How the pressure can attack your integrity.
Come on, you be nice this trip.
Were you nice last time?
You two want to sit together?
My God!
Norman, look at this, look at this.
Jesus!
That’ s just the fin.
That’ s the Habitat.
The Navy moved it in sections and set it up as a base...... as soon as the spaceship was discovered.
It' s manned by 2 naval personnel.
It will be your home- away- from- home while we investigate the spacecraft.
It ain’ t the Motel 6.
Approaching docking bay from R- 4.
All personnel, descent sub one engaging lock area.
You are now depressurized.
We’ re going to pressurize you now.
lt’ s hot in there, but you’ re going to feel coolness.
That’ s the helium.
- Helium?
- Was I the only one paying attention?
Oxygen is a corrosive gas, in the same family as fluorine and chlorine...... hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid.
That’ s why we’ re breathing helium.
Because oxygen at any level higher than 2. 3 becomes toxic.
Can you run that by me again, Ted?
I don’ t speak balloon.
What?
That’ s my voice.
The helium resonates differently with my vocal chords. ’ ’ Follow the yellow brick road. ’ ’
Kiddies, cut it out.
The voice regulators are behind you.
Put them on.
The Navy dive team is setting up a hydraulic robot...... in the air lock outside the spacecraft.
We’ il use that to open its door.
ls that the door?
Yeah, we used sonar imaging to pinpoint it before the divers went down.
- How tall is that robot?
- Five feet.
And it’ s roughly the same size as an airplane door, isn’ t it?
- Excuse me, Ted.
- I think that’ s worth taking note of.
Excuse me.
Tell them our team is in place and ready, okay?
This is Habitat to Navy dive.
Has it occurred to anyone maybe we shouldn’ t open that door?
Why do you say that?
We assume they’ il be green...... or insect- like, but basically human.
But what if they inhale air and exhale cyanide gas? lt’ s plausible.
Or live forever, like a virus or a yeast.
But why would you assume that a ULF would want to kill us?
An immortal creature wouldn’ t think killing was right or wrong.
lt’ d have no concept of it.
lnstant eradication. lt’ s what all the serious scientific stuff talks about.
What little there is on the subject.
You did put that in your report?
lt’ s in there.
Get us the ETD for team’ s departure to surface.
Tell them we’ re in ready and thank them.
Habitat to Navy Dive.
Our team’ s ready to take over.
Descent sub ready for your return to surface.
Thanks for all your help.
We’ il let you know what we find.
l’ m not too thrilled at the prospect of this.
What if you have to go to the bathroom?
Just go down your leg, Ted.
Really?
You can urinate in these?
You can.
The question is, do you want to?
Where’ s the switch?
Okay, let’ s go.
All right, Fletcher...... we’ re at 1, 022 feet.
The ambient temperature, 34 degrees.
Heading out north- northwest...... 330.
lt’ s a firm bottom.
lntermittent coral.
This is great, you guys.
Look at the size of that thing!
My God!
You see that tunnel?
That’ s where we’ re going.
lnto the heart of darkness.
We’ re in the coral pipe now, Fletcher, approaching the air lock.
l’ m feeling pressure in my ears.
ls that normal?
Just use your equalizer.
A little better.
The most toxic creatures on Earth live down here.
The venom of the land animal is nothing by comparison.
Even the weakest sea snake is invariably lethal.
ls that supposed to make me feel good, Beth?
This is our air lock.
lt’ il take us from a wet to a dry environment.
We’ re assuming the inside of the ship is sealed.
This thing is enormous.
That' s not budging, is it?
- Turn it at 45 degrees.
- What’ s happening here?
Is that piston broken?
Can you get the suction cup flat to the plane of the door?
Maybe it’ s the hydraulics.
The pressure messes everything up at this depth.
Time for a demonstration in basic physics, gentlemen.
What is it, Harry?
Take a look.
lt’ s chipped.
All right, it’ s chipped.
So what?
l thought you said this thing wasn’ t damaged when it crashed...... that this titanium alloy was so super- strong, you can’ t hurt it.
I did.
So why does it chip when this scientist just bangs it with a hammer?
ls there heat coming off this thing?
You’ re right.
Get out of there.
Back up.
Just a minute.
I mean, get back now!
Get back.
Jesus.
Anybody else wonder who the hell opened that door?
How did that happen?
l’ m not sure about the atmosphere.
Helmets stay on.
All right.
We come in peace.
Always wanted to say that.
Fletcher, inform the Navy we’ ve gained access...... to the spacecraft.
There' s a hell of a lot of radiation shielding in here.
Huge grids of catwalks and plumbing...
... and a lot of steam.
lt’ s endless.
We’ il stay in touch here.
Somebody’ s been here.
There’ s footsteps and they ain’ t ours.
So what do you say, Norman?
Time to turn back?
l’ m a little curious.
We’ il never cover the territory otherwise.
Split up?
He’ s got a point.
We’ ve only got about a half- hour of breathing time left.
Ted and Harry, you come with me.
Beth, Norman, stick together.
Come on.
I think the people who built this place would call that ’ ’ divide and conquer. ’ ’
Whoever built this thing wanted us dead, we’ d be dead already.
These guys offer a federal grant to study the effects of an alien invasion.
I told all this to Harry.
You made up the report?
No, not all of it.
I mean, I did research on half of it.
Who did the other half?
I borrowed from, you know, good writers.
lsaac Asimov, Rod Serling....
Rod Serling?
Who would’ ve thought anyone even reads those government reports.
You know?
I show up here, half the Pacific fleet is here.
I just didn’ t know what to do.
I wanted to tell you, that’ s all.
ls this in the same category as, ’ ’ Beth, I thought you knew I was married ’ ’?
I don’ t think we have enough oxygen --
- Oh, my God.
- Did you push something?
It did it on its own.
That must be the cockpit.
Hold on.
Look at this.
Cross- stress bracing on the outer hulls.
All axes supported.
Look at this stuff.
This is interesting.
Soft and strong at the same time.
lt’ s, like, better than rubber, better than steel.
You know a lot about this stuff.
I studied aeronautical engineering at M. l. T.
lsn’ t that where you got your Ph. D.?
lt’ s where I got mine.
All 3 of them.
I hated M. l. T.
Envy?
Puberty.
How old?
First Ph. D., 18.
Damn.
One year, Harry.
You beat me by one year.
Let’ s push on.
Let’ s go.
Man, they didn’ t tell you how heavy these things were out of the water.
Look at this.
Come here.
’ ’ Trash. ’ ’
"Basura."
Trash?
Oh, God.
Jesus!
lt’ s human.
You mean humanoid.
No, Norman, I mean human.
Blunt force trauma.
You can see by the direction that the fracture runs...... that he was hit in the back of the head.
What’ s in his hand?
I don’ t know.
What is it?
’ ’ Smokehouse Almonds ’ ’?
My God, it’ s an American spaceship.
It can’ t be an American spaceship.
There weren’ t even Americans, let alone spaceships.
It can’ t be, but it is.
Let’ s see if there’ s some kind of flight recorder or data computer...... where we can ring up some kind...... of a flight history.
I mean....
Look at this. lt’ s in English.
Come here.
Okay, good.
Right there.
And there.
Look at the dates!
Can’ t be.
Could be.
It could be 2043 or 1643.
I don’ t know which one is weirder.
’ ’ Unknown Entry Event. ’ ’ Press it.
You sure?
This is Barnes, Norman.
Yeah, I can hear you.
I can’ t explain it, but I think we’ re inside an American spaceship.
It gets better.
What the hell is it?
Whatever it is, it seems to be what this bird was designed to do.
Go out into space and gather things like this up and bring it back.
Yeah, but back from where?
Don’ t get too excited, Ted.
Turn this thing over, it’ il probably say ’ ’ Made in Korea. ’ ’
Somehow I doubt that.
No doors.
No hinges of any kind.
l’ il bet if you put a laser micrometer on this, it’ d be a perfect sphere.
Perfect to a thousandth of an inch.
That’ s a message in and of itself.
- Really?
- What do you mean?
When Pope Benedict asked Giotto to prove his worth as an artist...... Giotto drew a perfect circle...... freehand.
Perfection.
lt’ s a powerful message.
- I know what the Zen masters would say.
- What’ s that?
’ ’ This ball wants to be caught. ’ ’
Nobody built this thing looking into their third eye.
They went to a lot of trouble and they didn’ t do it for nothing.
Something put this thing out there to get picked up and brought back here.
Have you forgotten the Trojan horse?
It could be a trap.
Don’ t you think that’ s a little paranoid?
No, l’ m going to put a video camera on this thing and keep an eye on it.
Can I ask you something about this reflective surface?
Yeah, it appears to be mercury, doesn’ t it?
Except mercury’ s liquid at this temperature.
That’ s not what l’ m talking about.
What worries me is that it’ s reflecting everything but us.
I hate to be the one non- scientist that picks this up, guys.
You know what I mean?
What do you think it is?
I don’ t know.
Whatever it is...
... it’ s alien.
Okay, an American spacecraft, materials, technology...... more advanced than what we know, crashes into the ocean.
Why wasn’ t it damaged?
The materials are obviously super- strong.
lf that’ s true, why did it chip when you hit it?
Better:
It didn’ t crash.
It arrived...... 300 years ago.
- From where?
- Not ’ ’ where. ’ ’ When.
So you’ re saying this thing took a wrong turn?
That’ s right.
I mean, what if the craft...... inadvertently flew into a black hole?
It arrived in our past from its present.
The dates in the flight record -- 43, 47.
That has to be 2043, 2047.
The image you saw, what you described...... sounds like a black hole, a tear in the space --
We know what a black hole is.
I don’ t know.
lt’ s a collapsed star with so much gravity it’ s like a vacuum cleaner...... sucking everything into it, light, interstellar dust, time --
- Time?
- lt’ s possible, but not plausible.
lt’ s more than probable.
lt’ s rudimentary astrophysics.
We just haven’ t been able to fly into one and prove it.
I just got off the horn topside.
They’ re expecting a bad blow up there.
And they’ re pulling us out.
Pulling us out?
Wait a minute!
What do you mean?
What part of ’ ’ pull out ’ ’ don’ t you understand?
Extraction.
We’ re leaving.
That’ s ridiculous.
We haven’ t even begun to scratch the surface here.
lf you’ ve ever seen a Pacific cyclone, what we call a tornado is a little fart.
So I suggest you go back to the dormitory and take a nap.
You need to lower your metabolism before we start the decompression.
You’ re leaving a time- traveling spacecraft at the bottom of the ocean?
l’ m just following my orders.
But, no aliens.
- It was made in America.
- What’ s your point?
My point is, l’ m a biochemist and there’ s no life down here.
What is wrong with you?!
That doesn’ t mean there’ s nothing to learn, to explore!
She’ s right.
You guys are the human contact team for an Unknown Life Form.
There is no Unknown Life Form, so we pull out at 0900.
- Please say something to him.
- What?
I don’ t know.
Do you not have an opinion about this?
l’ m delighted we’ re going back up top.
You know what I mean?
This may look like a roadside diner, but in the meantime...... my ears won’ t pop and if I pull this thing away from my neck...... l sound like someone’ s squeezing my testicles.
Let’ s go home.
Barnes is wrong, you know.
You mean, wrong about the storm?
No, about the Sphere.
What about the Sphere?
lt’ s alive.
Why do you say that?
There’ s something inside it.
How can there be anything inside it?
There’ s no door, no seams.
The Sphere chooses what it will and won’ t reflect.
Doesn’ t that seem like the actions of a conscious being to you?
Pop psychology.
I think, for whatever it’ s worth, you’ re angry...... towards our friend Ted in there...... because he figured this out before you did.
You really think so?
This is my first underwater session.
You’ re right.
Ted did figure it out first, didn’ t he?
Good shrinkage.
We’ re all going to die down here, you know.
What?
What?
You see, it’ s curious.
Ted did figure it out.
Time travel.
And when we get back, we’ re going to tell everyone...... how it’ s possible, how it’ s done, what the dangers are.
But why 50 years in the future, when the spacecraft encounters a black hole...... does the computer call it an ’ ’ Unknown Entry Event ’ ’?
Why don’ t they know?
lf they don’ t know...... it means we never told anyone.
And if we never told anyone...... it means we never made it back.
Hence...... we die down here.
Just as a matter of deductive logic, Norman.
Damn, I wish I could get inside that Sphere.
- What’ s wrong?
- Talk to Mr. Barnes.
- Where is he?
- Video feed room.
Where is that?
I don’ t know where the hell anything is.
Where am l?
Where?
What’ s going on?
I don’ t know.
You tell me.
- What the hell is he doing?
- I don’ t know.
Do you know what he’ s doing?
- I need to know what you know.
- Nothing.
He wanted to go inside.
We are inside.
You mean outside?
- He said, ’ ’ inside. ’ ’ - What? lnside the spacecraft?
I think inside the Sphere.
Holy shit!
My God.
Did he go inside?
- I don’ t think so.
- What the hell’ s going on?
He didn’ t just disappear.
I think it’ s a glitch in the video.
Give me playback on that.
You’ il have it in a minute.
You knew he was doing this and you said nothing.
- You didn’ t think!
- I didn’ t think it possible.
Where are Beth and Ted?
I don’ t know.
I woke up, I heard bells ringing and I started running --
I' m not getting an image on the sub.
Impossible!
I got a cable in my quarters!
They’ il be here in 25 minutes or less!
The only logical explanation is that the sub is still at the surface.
ls it also logically possible your sonar is messed up?!
Let’ s just calm down, all right?
He didn’ t just disappear.
We are not going to leave him.
You got that right.
I am not going to lose a civilian on my watch.
You have just screwed up our trip to the surface.
We are not going up to the surface.
Harry!
We are not going up!
Harry!
Can you hear me?
Harry, can you hear me?
Norman, this is not a triage situation.
Go find me Ted and Beth.
Norman, stop.
Still no reading on the sub.
Forget the goddamn sonar, Teeny.
All right?
What the hell?
Can you hear me?
ls he alive?
We have a problem.
Harry’ s out cold.
His pulse is normal.
All his vitals are normal...... but I don’ t get it.
Hello.
Hello!
Norman, can you hear me?
We lost video here.
Can you hear me?
- That tears it.
- What, sir?
We’ re on internal power.
I don 't follow you.
For some reason the sub turned back.
Break out your 5- day deodorant pads.
We' re here for the duration.
Everything’ s normal.
What’ s going on?
ls he all right?
ls it true?
Did he go inside?
What did he say?
He didn’ t say.
He’ s aphasic.
He’ s asleep, Ted.
I can’ t believe he went inside.
He didn’ t say anything?
There’ s no door, no entry.
How did he get in?
Can I have your attention, please?
We' ve lost contact with the surface.
The Habitat is now operating solely under internal power.
We have plenty of food, oxygen and fresh water...... to sustain us until the storm is over...... and we reestablish contact with the surface.
But until that time, this mission is subject...... to emergency authority under my command.
l’ m taking this out to the mini- sub.
- Are you up on the duty roster?
- Yes, sir.
Where’ s she going?
lt’ s procedures.
Everything in the Habitat is videoed.
Every 1 2 hours we take the videos to the mini- sub and press the reset button.
The idea is, if something happens to us and we don’ t reset it...... the sub goes to the surface automatically.
lf we’ re all dead, they at least have a partial record of what went wrong.
Cheerful thought, huh?
Mind the store a minute.
l’ m going to the head.
What the hell’ s that?
lt’ s so beautiful down here.
lt’ s so tranquil.
This is beautiful.
lt’ s hard to believe we have a typhoon 1, 000 feet above our heads.
Hey, it' s snowing down here.
You see them?
There' s got to be a million...... jellyfish down here.
Man, this is really beautiful.
These jellyfish are getting a little friendly.
Having a hard time seeing.
Hey, guys, you getting this?
It' s getting thick down here.
Hello, hello.
I can 't see what I' m doing.
They’ re sticking to my faceplate.
Fletcher, this is Dr. Fielding.
Just swim through them.
They’ re harmless.
Guys, these jellyfish are everywhere.
Fletcher, get out of there.
What are jellyfish doing at 1, 000 feet?
I think they feel the heat from my body.
I can’ t get them off me!
They’ re stinging through my suit!
Get back to the Habitat on the double.
I can’ t move my legs!
Come back to the Habitat.
They’ re inside my suit!
Keep moving!
Just keep moving!
Help me!
Jesus, Barnes, she' s dead!
There' s no bubbles.
Edmunds.
Yes, sir?
Come on down here.
Something...... happened to Fletcher.
God!
When I was 5 years old I went out on a boat with my father.
He told me not to jump in the water, so of course I did and....
Oh, my!
I jumped right into a school of these guys.
Not this big, though.
l think every one had a shot at me.
I don’ t know what this lady felt...... but, man, it went beyond pain.
l’ ve been...
... afraid of them since.
Would you feel any better if I told you this wasn’ t exactly a jellyfish?
You mean...?
I mean, jellyfish like this are unheard of.
I don’ t know what this is, but it isn’ t God’ s creation.
Here I am Your special island
Come to me
Bali Ha 'i
You can come in.
Have a seat.
You want some coffee?
- No, thanks.
- How well do you know Dr. Halperin?
I used to teach at UC San Diego years ago.
She came for her master’ s.
Don’ t take it personally, but I assume she wasn’ t a romantic interest.
Don’ t take what personally?
She’ s a tall, vibrant, younger woman.
What’ s your point?
You knew her as a patient.
l’ m not at liberty to discuss that.
You understand.
I understand an exotic- gas environment 1, 000 feet under water...... with no lifeline to the surface...... is about the most dangerous environment on the planet.
lf there’ s a problem, I got to know about it.
- Beth is fine. - ’ ’ Beth is fine. ’ ’
- Beth’ s fine.
- She’ s very fine.
Would you like to read this and tell me what it says?
- Are these my actual notes?
- What does it say?
- How in the world did you get -- - Does it say ’ ’ suicide attempt ’ ’? ’ ’ Electroshock therapy ’ ’?
lsn’ t that what it says?
What’ s your point?
Didn’ t it seem important enough to tell somebody?
You were willing to jeopardize these people’ s lives...... to have someone here who could be mentally unstable?
Are you aware of the term, ’ ’ overreact ’ ’?
We’ re 160 fathoms down.
And we’ ve got a nutbag down here who can flip out and crack up.
You selected the team.
Why didn’ t you tell me?
When I wrote this, I didn’ t know the team would be 1, 000 -- 1, 000 or 10, it makes no difference!
Why didn’ t you tell me about Beth?
It wasn’ t pertinent.
That was not your call to make!
Yes, it was and it still is.
It was a passive attempt.
A passive attempt?!
Those who really want to kill themselves shoot themselves or go over a bridge.
They don’ t call their boyfriend and say, ’ ’ I just took 20 Nebutol.
Help me. ’ ’
She took 20 yellows, and you’ re telling me she’ s perfect.
What is it?
Come in.
What?
He’ s awake?
He’ s really awake.
Man, oh, man!
You’ re going to have a problem with me.
lf my good buddy Norman keeps cooking like this, I ain’ t going nowhere.
This toast is good.
Bacon?
Better.
But these eggs!
These eggs are fantastic!
Norman, what did you put in these eggs?
No, no, wait.
Don’ t tell me.
Parsley.
Chives.
Tarragon and....
What is that?
Chervil?
ls that chervil?
Yes, it is.
l’ m glad you like it, Harry.
I love eggs!
They sure seem to cheer you up.
Do you remember what happened?
Yeah.
I went inside.
How did you get inside?
There are no doors.
There are doors all over this place and we can’ t get out.
- We’ re still here.
- Yes, we are.
You didn’ t answer my question.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Harry, are you saying we shouldn’ t still be here?
Where’ s Teeny?
I thought she did all the cooking.
She had an unfortunate accident, Harry.
She was killed.
Killed?
How?
Jellyfish.
Jellyfish?
That’ s strange.
Yes, it is strange, isn’ t it?
Here you go, Harry.
- Little onion rings.
Look at that.
- lt’ s not onion rings.
Good, though.
Guess what it is.
Calamari!
You all right?
Cough, cough, cough.
- No, you’ re doing it wrong.
- I know what l’ m doing.
Bring it up.
Come on, bring it up.
He’ s trying to say something.
He’ s trying to talk.
You don’ t listen.
He wants to say something!
- l’ m not choking, you asshole!
- See?
I hate squid.
I hate squid.
l’ m sorry.
I was trying to help.
You okay?
Harry, let me ask you something.
Before you went in the Sphere, you were convinced we would die here.
Yeah, I remember that.
You still believe it?
You afraid of dying, Norman?
Bullshit!
He’ s hiding something and you know it.
He went inside the Sphere and whatever it is he saw, he won’ t tell us.
- He said he doesn’ t remember anything.
- You bought that?
The whole food thing was all a diversion.
The guy’ s willing to put all of our lives on the line...... because he doesn’ t want to share information.
I can see it.
He’ s making notes for a book.
He wants to win the Nobel Prize.
And you don’ t?
Norman, you’ ve known me since I was 17 years old.
I would love to be the guy who gets --
Do you know how respected --
l’ m not! l’ ve written one ’ ’ Fun With Dick and Jane ’ ’ book on physics.
I mean, Niels Bohr...... he published ’ ’ The Quantum Theory of Atomic Structure ’ ’ at 28.
Einstein, relativity, 26.
Newton, gravity, 23.
ln physics, if you haven’ t done it by 35, chances are you never will.
This doesn’ t have anything to do with your competitiveness with Harry?
19.
Wunderkind!
I rest my case.
Mr. Barnes would like to see you.
Something’ s wrong with the computer system.
- Try purging it.
- I tried.
It just keeps coming back.
Discharge from the buffer memory?
I ruled that out.
The helium is getting to the chips.
lt’ s probably a saturation effect.
- lf that’ s true, what are our options?
- You have to change all the chips.
Forget it.
Run this place on manual?
lt’ s going to be a long 4 days.
Hey, boss.
- Figured that out yet?
- lt’ s a saturation effect.
I don’ t think so. lf it’ s a saturation effect, it would be random.
What do you mean?
This has a pattern.
See? lt’ s like a code.
A code from where?
How’ d you do that?
How’ d you see that?
Try binary.
See?
Letter breaks.
You think this is coming from the Sphere?
Don’ t know.
This mission is ultra top- secret.
What you translate is for my eyes only.
lf you were it, how would you know our alphabet?
Same way it’ s configured on a keyboard.
But reflected in an orb, spherically.
A keyboard, but spherical.
Take a keyboard...... wrap it around a sphere...... then starting at the center key, G, number the letters...... spiraling out.
- You the man!
- I still got it.
I still got the juice.
Keyboard.
They let you keep those?
Here, you want them?
All we got to do now is plug in the numbers.
Friends...... in the 8, 000 years of recorded history, this is a first.
You’ re now on- line with an alien intelligence.
You got to be kidding.
You must’ ve messed up the translation.
I don’ t think so.
lf this is right, this alien sounds like an idiot.
That’ s something to consider.
A stupid alien.
They must have them.
I will admit the message is childlike, but actually it’ s quite perfect.
lt’ s short, to the point, non- threatening...... kind of the way you talk to a small child or a dog.
Look at this.
He’ s making a speech.
Ask him for his last name.
What?
I want a full name for my report.
l’ m not putting in my report I lost a crew member on a deepsat expedition...... to find an alien named Jerry.
Please! ’ ’ Jerry ’ ’?
We ought to tell him that we’ re enjoying it too.
Ask him where he’ s from.
Where are you from?
’ ’ I make a journey.
You make a journey.
We make a journey together. ’ ’
I think Jerry’ s channeling Deepak Chopra.
A journey from where?
He’ s happy.
He’ s crafty.
What happened?
Damn, I think we lost him.
We’ re not alone.
We are definitely...... not alone.
lt’ s trying to make contact with us.
Whatever it is, it was inside that Sphere.
Now it’ s out, free to act.
What do you mean by that?
Free to take over our computers...... call us on the phone, come knock on the door if it wants to.
A physical presence.
What are you thinking about?
That last part where he said, ’ ’ I am happy. ’ ’
Don’ t you want Jerry to be happy?
Honestly?
What’ s on your mind?
I would be happy if Jerry had no emotions whatsoever.
Because the thing of it is, here’ s Jerry...... an emotional being, cooped up for 300 years with no one to talk to...... none of the socialization, the emotional growth...... that comes from contact with other emotional beings....
So?
What happens if Jerry gets mad?
What is that sound?
Did you hear it?
You hear that thump?
What is that sound?
Can you hear me?
Did you hear that thump?
You are a hell of a woman.
I wish I knew you in the old days.
Norman told me you were --
Norman told you what?
Let’ s put it this way, that if Jerry could read your mind...... he’ d be bored with ours.
What is that sound?
Can you hear me?
This is Norman.
I get no answer from Edmunds and there’ s strange noises.
Something’ s going on.
It looks like Edmunds is up on the side of the Habitat.
I' m not getting anything on sonar, but watch yourselves out there.
Would you hit your callback buttons, please?
What’ d you tell Barnes?
About what?
About me.
You told him I took 20 Nebutol and tried to kill myself.
Didn’ t you?
He had my notes.
What do you want me to do?
Did you tell him who I called?
Oh, God.
Come in.
Did you guys find that thumping yet?
