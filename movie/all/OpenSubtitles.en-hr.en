Senators, consider the opportunities for the Empire.
At last, the destinies of the planets
Shinzon of Remus is offering us a chance to make ourselves stronger than ever before.
It would be madness to reject it.
I beg you not to let prejudice or politics interfere with this Alliance.
By joining Shinzon' s forces with ours, not even the Federation will be able to stand in our way.
That' s enough!
The decision has been made.
The military does not dictate policy on Romulus.
Shinzon' s proposal and rejected it.
He and his followers will be met with all deliberate force and sent back to that black rock they came from.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, sir.
If you will excuse me, Praetor,
I have an appointment with the Tholian Ambassador.
Of course.
Senators, are there any others who wish to speak?
Then I call for a vote on the motion to open trade negotiations with Celes Il.
As you know, the Reman mines have not been filling their quotas for months now.
I hope you will all bear in mind the Trade Committee' s findings.
As much as we don' t want...
Would someone alert Security?
Bring back Senator Tal' aura.
Duty.
A starship captain' s life is filled with solemn duty.
I have negotiated peace treaties between implacable enemies.
But none of this compares with my solemn duty today... as best man.
Of course, you' re happy, but what about my needs?
This is all a damned inconvenience.
I will be training my new First Officer.
He' s a tyrannical martinet who will never, ever allow me to go on away missions.
That is the regulation, sir.
Starfleet Code Section 12, Paragraph Four...
Sir?
Shut up.
Yes, sir.
15 years I' ve been waiting to say that.
No, seriously.
Will, Deanna, there' s still time to reconsider.
- No.
- No.
No?
Oh, very well, then.
Will Riker, you have been my trusted right arm for 15 years.
You have kept my course true and steady.
Deanna Troi, you' ve been my guide and my conscience.
You have helped me recognize the better parts of myself.
You are my family.
I wish you both clear horizons.
My good friends... make it so.
The bride and groom!
To the bride and groom.
You ever think about getting married again?
No.
23 was my limit.
Are you all right?
Romulan ale should be illegal.
It is.
It was from the heart.
And you needn' t worry.
I' m going to brief your new Counselor on everything she needs to know.
Oh, like hell you are.
You already know too much about me.
But I take it that there will be no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
No, no speeches and no clothes.
I have discovered it is traditional to present the happy couple with a gift.
I have elected to present the following as my gift in honor of their conjugation.
Never saw the sun
Going so right
Irving Berlin...
It' s tradition, Worf.
You, of all people, should appreciate that.
I will not do it!
Won' t do what, Mr. Worf?
Oh, come now.
A big, handsome, strapping fellow like you?
What can you be afraid of?
Captain, I am picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarun system.
What sort of signature?
Positronic.
It' s very faint, but I' ve isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarun system.
Uncharted.
We' il have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize there is an android on Kolarus ill.
Just what I was afraid of.
It' s still well on our side.
I think, uh...
Don' t worry, Number One.
We' il still have you to Betazed with plenty of time to spare.
Where we will all honor the Betazoid tradition.
Now, if you' il excuse me,
I' il be in the gym.
Warp five.
What do you think, Data?
A long- lost relative?
I' m reading six distinct positronic signatures spread out over a few kilometers on the planet' s surface.
What do we know about the population on Kolarus ill?
Isolated pockets of humanoids.
It appears to be a prewarp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
Captain, I wouldn' t recommend using the transporter.
That ion storm doesn' t look very neighborly.
It could head in our direction without much warning.
Understood.
You' re with me.
Captain, I don' t have to remind you...
But, uh, I' ve been itching to try the Argo.
I' il bet.
Captain' s prerogative.
There' s no foreseeable danger.
And your wife would never forgive me if anything were to happen to you.
Mr. Troi.
I will always be puzzled by the human predilection for piloting vehicles at unsafe velocities.
Half a kilometer.
The radiant electromagnetic field is interfering with my tricorder but we are within a few meters of the signal.
Fan out.
Let' s search around.
It appears to be a robotic arm.
Very astute.
Mr. Worf, bring it to the vehicle.
This doesn' t feel right.
The final signature is approximately 100 meters to the north, sir.
It' s you.
The resemblance is striking.
- Fascinating.
- Fascinating.
To the vehicle.
I think it' s time to try some unsafe velocities.
Why do you have a shiny head?
Why?
Because the Captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
Why?
- Data!
Sorry, sir.
Have I said something wrong?
Data.
I think you have nicer eyes.
Our eyes are identical, Doctor.
So what have we got, Geordi?
The neural pathways aren' t nearly as sophisticated.
I' d say he' s a prototype.
Something Dr. Soong created prior to Data.
I am...
B- 4.
Dr. Soong' s penchant for whimsical names seems to have no end.
Can you tell us how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
I do not know.
Do you remember anything of your life before you were on the planet?
No.
Why does the tall man have a furry face?
Number One, keep me informed and, uh, Geordi, reassemble him.
Aye, sir.
B- 4, do you know who I am?
You are me.
No.
My name is Data.
I am your brother.
Tea, Earl Grey, hot.
Captain, you have an alpha priority communication from Starfleet Command.
Acknowledged.
Admiral Janeway, how good to see you again.
Jean- Luc, how' d you like a trip to Romulus?
With or without the rest of the fleet?
A diplomatic mission.
We' ve been invited, believe it or not.
Seems there' s been some kind of internal political shakeup.
New Praetor?
There' s more.
He' s Reman.
Believe me, we don' t understand it either.
You' re the closest ship, so I want you to go and hear what he has to say.
If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire Quadrant.
Understood.
We' re sending you all the intelligence we have, but it' s not much.
Hardly.
The Son' a, the Borg, the Romulans... you seem to get all the easy assignments.
Just lucky, Admiral.
Let' s hope that luck holds.
Janeway out.
Helmsman, lay in a new course.
Take us to Romulus, warp eight.
Aye, aye, sir.
Course plotted and laid in.
Romulus?
Engage.
As you can see, one side of Remus always faces the sun.
Due to the extreme temperatures on that half of their world, the Remans live on the dark side of the planet.
Almost nothing is known of the Reman homeworld although Intelligence scans have proven the existence of dilithium mining and heavy weapons construction.
But they also have a reputation for being formidable warriors.
Cannon fodder.
Yeah, but how did a Reman get to be Praetor?
I don' t get it.
Coup d' etat?
Praetor' s power has always been the Romulan fleet.
They must have been behind Shinzon for him to have overthrown the Senate.
What have we learned about Shinzon?
Starfleet Intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record.
We can infer he is relatively young and a capable commander.
He fought 12 major engagements in the war, all successful.
Beyond that, we know nothing.
Well, it seems as though we are truly sailing into the unknown.
Anything you can give me will be appreciated.
Dismissed.
I still can' t believe the Captain went along with the memory download.
Captain Picard agrees that the B- 4 was probably designed with the same self- actualization parameters as myself.
If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
Yeah, but he would also have all of your memories as well.
You feel comfortable with that?
I feel nothing, Geordi.
It is my belief that with my memory engrams, he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
An individual more like you, you mean.
Yes.
Maybe he' s not supposed to be like you, Data.
Maybe he' s supposed to be exactly the way he is.
That might be so, but I believe he should have the opportunity to explore his potential.
Okay, we' re done.
B- 4, do you know where you are?
I am in a room with lights.
Can you remember our father?
Our father?
Yes, Dr. Soong.
No.
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
No.
Data, he' s assimilating a lot of programming.
Remember, he' s a prototype, a lot less sophisticated than you are.
We just don' t know if his matrix will be able to adapt.
We really need to give him some time.
Geordi, what purpose does this serve?
What?
This.
That' s a redundant memory port.
Maybe the provisional memory storage is in case his neural pathways overload.
Do you mind if I keep him here for a while run a few diagnostics?
No, I do not mind.
Data.
You must remain with Commander La Forge.
He is going to try to help you.
Captain' s Log, Stardate 56844. 9.
The Enterprise has arrived at Romulus and is waiting at the designated coordinates.
All our hails have gone unanswered.
Counselor?
They' re out there, sir.
Captain, I recommend we raise shields.
Not yet, Mr. Worf.
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocol, the Federation Council isn' t sitting out here; we are.
Patience.
We will wait.
Captain...
- No!
- Captain...
Tactical analysis, Mr. Worf.
52 disruptor banks, 27 photon torpedo bays primary and secondary shields.
She' s a predator.
We are being hailed.
On screen.
Enterprise, we are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
Praetor Shinzon, I' m pleased...
I am not Shinzon.
I am his Viceroy.
We are sending transport coordinates.
Not very chatty.
Away team to Transporter Room 4.
I hope you' il forgive the darkness.
We are not comfortable in the light.
Praetor Shinzon?
Captain Picard.
Jean- Luc Picard.
I' d always imagined you a little taller.
Isn' t that odd?
You may scan me without subterfuge, Commander Data.
No?
You are human.
Why have you asked us to come here?
Praetor?
I' ve never met a human woman before.
I' m only half human.
Deanna Troi... of Betazed.
Empathic and telepathic abilities, Ship' s Counselor... all this I knew, but I never knew you were so... beautiful.
You seem quite familiar with our personnel.
Oh, I am, Commander Riker.
May I touch your hair?
We came to Romulus on a matter we were assured was of great importance.
Yes.
I' m sorry, Captain.
There is so much we need to talk about.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
Unity, Captain.
Tearing down the walls between us, to recognize that we are one.
I' m talking of the thing that makes us the same... peace.
We want peace.
But you' re also thinking that the chance for peace is too promising to ignore.
Am I right?
Yes.
Then perhaps it' s time to add some illumination to our discussion.
Computer, raise the lighting four levels.
I was stricken with an odd disease.
I developed a hypersensitivity to sound.
Even the slightest whisper caused me agony.
No one could do anything about it.
Finally, I was taken to a doctor who had some experience of Terran illnesses and he diagnosed me with Shalaft' s syndrome.
Do you know of it, Captain?
Then you know it' s a very rare syndrome.
Genetic.
Apparently, all the male members of a family have it.
Eventually, I was treated, and now I can hear as well as you can, Captain.
I can see as well as you can.
I can feel... everything you feel.
In fact, I feel exactly what you feel... don' t I, Jean- Luc?
Come to dinner... tomorrow on Romulus, just the two of us.
Or should I say... just the one of us?
I think you' il be wanting this.
Till tomorrow then, Captain.
We have much to discuss.
Computer, return lighting to previous level.
There' s no doubt, Captain... right down to your aggressive strain of Shalaft' s syndrome.
He' s a clone.
They probably used a hair follicle or a skin cell.
Why?
I intend to find out, Number One.
Inform Starfleet of the situation.
I need to know where the hell he came from.
Counselor.
We supported you, Shinzon, when you assassinated the Senate.
You told us the timing was perfect for an attack on the Federation.
I don' t understand why now, you delay.
You don' t have to understand.
And bringing the Enterprise here...
What possible purpose could that serve?
Then perhaps you' il enlighten us.
Silence from you!
You really must learn patience, Commander.
Spend 18 hours every day under the lash of a Romulan guard, and you' il soon understand patience.
Now go.
Commander Donatra.
Please, remain.
I want you to consider: allegiance.
It' s something I demand from those who serve me.
Do I serve you?
And I think, faithfully.
Commander Suran, on the other hand... gives me pause.
Here' s another word, Praetor: trust.
Do you trust me?
How far does that trust extend?
How... deep does it go?
What must a Commander do to prove herself faithful to you?
What must a woman do?
You... are not a woman.
You are a Romulan.
Serve me faithfully, and you will be rewarded.
Keep those lovely eyes on Commander Suran.
And at the first sign of treachery...
Dispose of him.
Then you will have proven yourself.
Now go.
And, Commander...
if you ever touch me again...
I' il kill you.
The Romulans had somehow gained possession of your DNA and I had been created.
And when I was ready, they were going to replace you with me... put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet.
It was a bold plan.
What happened?
As happens frequently here on Romulus... a new government came to power.
They decided to abandon the plan.
They were afraid that I might be discovered, that it would lead to war.
Not quite.
A lifetime of violence will do that.
They broke my nose my jaw... but so much is the same.
The eyes...
Yes.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don' t they?
And yours are so confident.
Well, I had always hoped I might hit two meters.
As had I.
How did you end up on Remus?
How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines?
Not that it mattered, as I was no longer part of their plans against the Federation.
In those terrible depths lived only the damned.
Together with the Reman slaves, I was condemned to an existence of unceasing labor and starvation under the brutal heel of the Romulan guards.
Only the very strongest had any hope of survival.
I was only a child when they took me.
The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me.
But one man took pity on me.
The man that became my Viceroy.
He protected me from the cruelty of the guards and taught me how to survive.
And in that dark place where there was nothing of myself
They showed me the only true kindness I have ever known.
You' re doing this to liberate the Remans?
That is the single thought behind everything I have done... from building the Scimitar at a secret base to assembling my army finally coming to Romulus in force.
I knew they would never give us our freedom.
And how many Romulans died for your freedom?
But the point is, that finally the Empire is realizing that there is a better way.
You don' t trust me.
I have no reason to.
If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people you would be standing where I am.
And if you had lived my life, you would understand my responsibility to the Federation.
I cannot allow my personal feelings to unduly influence my decisions.
All I have are my personal feelings.
I want to know what it means to be human.
The Remans have given me a future, but you can tell me about my past.
I can tell you about my past.
Were we Picards always warriors?
I think of myself as an explorer.
Well, were we always explorers?
I was the first Picard to leave our solar system.
It caused quite a stir in the family.
Looking up at the stars dreaming about what was up there.
New worlds.
I' m trying to believe you, Shinzon.
If there is one ideal that the Federation holds most dear it is that all men... all races can be united.
What better example than a Starfleet captain standing in the Romulan Senate.
Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friendship... in time... when that trust has been earned.
Captain, we have had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
Source?
The data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
What programs were accessed?
Well... that' s what I can' t figure out.
It' s mostly just basic stellar cartography.
Star charts, communications protocols, some uplinks from colony tracking stations.
Nevertheless, we must learn the source.
Keep me informed.
Captain, there' s something else.
I was reviewing the sensor logs.
Look at this.
When the Scimitar de- cloaked there was a momentary spike in the tertiary EM band.
There.
You' re not going to believe this.
It' s thalaron.
I thought thalaron radiation was theoretical.
Which is why our initial scans didn' t pick it up, but he' s got it, Captain.
Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its biogenic properties.
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level.
I can' t overestimate the danger of thalaron radiation, Jean- Luc.
A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
I understand.
I want to know what he has and how we can neutralize any threat.
I need options.
This was a mistake.
We' re wasting time.
My time.
And I shall spend it how I choose.
Do not forget our mission, Shinzon.
We must act now.
We' il return to the Scimitar.
Come.
Beverly, come in.
Remember him?
He was a bit cocky as I recall.
He was a damned fool.
Selfish, ambitious very much in need of seasoning.
He turned out all right.
I really wanted to believe Shinzon.
But this thalaron radiation just can' t be explained away.
Whatever he' s after, it isn' t peace.
Is he very much the way you were?
Data to Captain Picard.
Go ahead, Data.
Captain, Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access and I believe we have found a way to gain a tactical advantage.
On my way.
Will... as Ship' s Counselor, I recommend you get some sleep.
Some honeymoon.
Come to bed.
Imzadi.
He can never know you as I can.
He can never touch you as I can.
This isn' t real.
Feel my lips.
I' m with you, Imzadi.
I' il always be with you now.
- Deanna... what' s the matter?
- No.
- Deanna.
No!
The bond has been broken.
Find her again.
Praetor, we' ve received the transponder signal.
It' s accelerating.
You have no more time for games.
Have the doctors prepare.
Transport.
Begin the download.
Hot.
Aside from slightly elevated levels of adrenaline and serotonin, you' re perfectly normal.
It was a...
It was a violation.
Shinzon' s Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts.
I' ve become a liability.
I request to be relieved of my duties.
If you can endure more of these assaults,
I need you at my side, now more than ever.
The Enterprise is far from Federation space and...
Shields up!
Hello, Jean- Luc.
Why am I here?
I was lonely.
What are you going to do?
I need a sample of your blood.
What is it your Borg friends say?
Oh, yes... the android.
The bait you couldn' t refuse.
All of this so you could capture me.
Don' t be so vain.
After we found it, we had to make a few modifications.
An extra memory port, a hidden transponder.
I' ve now gained access to Starfleet' s communications protocol.
I now know the exact location of your entire fleet.
You may go.
Out of my sight.
What is all this about?
It' s about destiny, Picard.
It' s about a Reman outcast.
So what am I?
- [Radio Static Crackling]
Six minutes.
Almost got one of the fuses fixed.
Thirty seconds.
Get out now.
- Yeah.
- It' s Duncan.
What are you doing at home?
- Jogging.
- How long does it take you to get to work?
- Harry, what time is it there?
- How long?
- Thirty, 40 minutes.
Why?
- [Hanging Up]
- Duncan.
- What the hell' s goin 'on?
- Read the cable.
- Look, if I' m walking into a shitstorm,
I' ve gotta know which way the wind' s blowing.
- Boy Scout' s in trouble.
- What kind of trouble?
- Where are you calling from?
Are you in your car?
Are you out of your fucking mind?
He' s a big boy.
He can take care of himself.
You call me from secure when you get there.
Let' s see your driver' s license.
Sorry, sir.
You need to come to the desk with me, please.
Mr. Muir.
Duty roster has you checking out tonight.
Just a reminder: on your way out, we need to sign out your I. D., card key, parking pass.
It' s a date.
You got a cable from Hong Kong?
You check the operations center?
I go up there, Billy Nyland' s gonna want to collect... that hundred I owe him from the 'Skins game.
Pull it off the mainframe for me, will you?
My last day.
Gladys.
Cubans are in the drawer on the left.
If these walls could talk, huh?
All this history.
I envy you.
- Bag your job.
You can be just like me.
- No, really.
The debt this country owes you guys.
Chuck, are we gonna dance all night with your hand on my ass, or are you gonna make your move?
You used to run an agent named Bishop.
- Tom Bishop.
Yeah.
How is he?
- We' d like to take a look at his files.
Did you try Records?
Of course, we have his main files.
It was your personals.
- What do you want to know?
- We' il have your Bishop op reports downloaded... and sorted in an hour or two; for now, I' il just take your files.
Grab yourself a seat and make yourself comfortable.
It' s gonna take me a while to dig 'em up.
Call my office as soon as you have 'em.
ASAP.
Oh, Muir?
Good luck with the retirement.
The director sent this down.
Actually, it looks like he signed it himself.
Oh, and Harker said I' m supposed to collect all your files on Tom Bishop.
Finally get to use one of these burn bags.
Hold this, till you hear otherwise.
- You didn' t see what I put in.
- Are we feeling a little paranoid on our last day?
When did Noah build the ark, Gladys?
Before the rain.
Before the rain.
Hey, Billy, you got my hundred?
Harker said to bring this file up.
You want to buzz me through?
No, I can' t, sir.
But I' il make sure he gets it.
Sir?
Can you get that Chinese translator?
No, that looks pretty good.
Looks good.... as for the upcoming trade negotiations in the Far East, a team of negotiators has been working with the Chinese... in an effort to streamline the proceedings... and lay the ground work for the President' s trip next week.
In other world news...
Jeez. now that the Cold War is finally over, Berliners are proclaiming a new era... here where Soviet and American tanks faced each other... in the darkest days of the Communist --
Is this it?
It' s all I could find.
Packed, misplaced -- you know how it is.
Moving day and all.
It' s probably mostly up here anyway.
Old school, you know?
Muir?
Step this way?
Sit down here, please, Muir?
Jesus, Aiken.
How long has it been?
This task force have a name?
This isa tough one, Troy.
I' m gonna see you later.
You got it, Cy.
Good to see you.
Thanks for stoppin 'by.
For the record, we' ve been joined by Nathan Muir, Near East ops.
We' re in the process of dealing... with a fairly specific... international flap.
We brought you in here as a stop gap.
- Fill in a few holes for us.
- So I' m like the little Dutch boy, huh?
Yeah!
We just need you to be a team player on this one, Muir.
- Why is that funny?
Every time my coach told me that, I knew I was about to get benched.
Due to the nature of this task force, Nathan, there will be certain information which you don' t need to know.
A week ago, Tom Bishop disappeared in Hong Kong.
Last night he turned up outside Shanghai.
He' s been arrested for espionage.
We' re working up a profile based on relevant personal histories and op records.
This has to be handled with kid gloves.
- Twenty- four hours.
- Starting when?
As of now, Nathan.
Bishop has been classified as a common criminal, and will be executed at 8: 00 A. M. tomorrow morning, our time.
What about the press?
Why not leak it and throw the spotlight on China, and buy us some time?
We need the press on this like we need a third teat.
- [Troy Chuckling]
We don' t want outside influences to... limit our options.
What was Bishop doing in China?
He was with an operation for Harry Duncan.
Was?
Yes.
Until he took matters into his own hands.
Well, where are they holding him?
- Oh, I' m sorry, Nathan.
- It would be nice to know what gaps are filled.
I' ve only got ten fingers here, you know?
I guess, kind of tough timing, hmm?
A week before the president' s road trip.
You guys afraid there' s gonna be a congressional hearing?
That' s why we' re transcribing and videotaping.
Right?
Are you gonna want me to testify?
- No.
- No?
Absolutely not.
- You met Bishop in Vietnam, right?
- Yeah.
Spring of' 75.
Hue had just fallen.
Danang would go in a couple of days.
And I had flown in country to get an ARVN sniper... who' d been with us throughout the Phoenix program.
Spent the last year Rocky Mountain way
- I gotsome bad news for you, sir. he' s dead.
- Dead?
Just before dawn.
Caught a mortar round with his teeth.
Got anybody else?
There' s a staff sergeant came my way a while back, but he' s nowhere near Binh' s 40 confirmed.
How many has he got?
Three kills.
Christ, and that' s the best you got?
He' s a fine shot, sir.
Where is he?
Right over there.
Where, in the back?
Yeah.
There is another guy, 20 kills, but he' s at least two days away.
- Confirm that for me?
- Yes, sir.
Why is he over there?
They live separate... from the other men, cook their own food -- gook food.
Smells awful, sir.
Not to the enemy.
Send him in.
Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir?
- Bishop?
That' s correct, sir.
- [Clears Throat]
- Hemet, California, sir.
Have a seat.
I take it you didn' t get to be a marksman putting food on your mama' s table.
No, sir, we have a Safeway back home.
Where' d you learn to shoot?
Boy Scouts, sir.
[Laughs]
No, sir.
When did you get pulled in?
I volunteered, sir.
[Muir Narrating]
He came acrossas one of those idealistic types -- you know, a little bit of an attitude?
Starts out trying to see what he' s made of, and ends up not liking the view.
- Who was the target, Muir?
- General Hun Chea.
He' s Laotian?
Yeah.
Unofficial enemy.
Code name:
Red Shirt.
He' s responsible for the western flank of the upcoming Saigon offensive.
His name -- Don' t need a name, sir.
You don' t need it?
Or you don' t want it?
Yeah, I' il do it, sir.
[Helicopter Engine Roaring]
The target will be at a location... twenty- one clicks away, tomorrow morning at 0900.
It' s a high- powered meet- and- greet with the Vietcong.
Will he be alone, sir?
He sometimes travels with a bit of an entourage.
"A bit ofan entourage?"
- Red Shirt located.
Do you have in sight?
- Red Shirt confirmed.
Niner- eight- zero to gate.
One- zero- zero- five to table.
Wind... five miles left.
Target in sight.
Bravo Six, Bravo Six.
Delta Two.
Over.
- Go, Delta Two.
- We have target in sight, but no shot.
- Say again?
- No shot.
- Helo is obstructing target.
- Helo?
NVA doesn' t have air support.
Position in jeopardy.
Our position is compromised.
Over.
- Say it again.
Over?
- Shh.
We' re still a go.
We have no go.
Clear.
- Don' t take the shot!
See if you can get 'em back.
Delta Two, Delta Two --
Move!
Come on, come on.
Delta Two, Delta Two.
Bravo Six, over.
Sorry about your man, Captain.
You want to make another pass, sir?
Hold it.
Go back again.
Hell of an ad for the Boy Scouts.
Did you have a presidential finding authorizing those kills?
I don' t believe we' ve met.
- Who are you?
- Dr. William Byars.
National Security Council.
Was there a finding, Muir?
Well, we were in a place we weren' t supposed to be, assassinating a general from a country we weren' t at war with -- of course, we weren' t officially at war with North Vietnam, either --
- Is that a "no"?
- Oh, come on, guys.
We' re on the clock.
The president admits Bishop is ours, denies he' s a spy, we put out the fires and negotiate a deal.
Unless I' m missing something.
[Whispering]
Muir' s secretary' s on -- [Indistinct]
- [Whispering Continues]
This will just take a second.
Stop tape.
She says it' s urgent.
Go ahead.
Want to take it outside?
No, no.
I' il take it in here.
That' s fine.
- Hello?
- Got your message.
You want me to start a fire yet?
Oh, uh, right.
This' il just take a second.
Right.
Tell you what.
Why don' t you hold that reservation, and, uh, we may still be able to use it.
You might just.
As we speak, there are three guys rummaging... through everything I spent a week packing.
Uh- huh.
Okay.
Uh- huh.
- [Muir]
It' s insubstantial.
Right.
Mm- hmm.
Okay.
That' il be good.
- have no real importance.
- You still there?
Y- Yeah.
So he was an assassin, recruited to kill.
Sounds good.
Bye- bye.
[Sighs Deeply]
Wife planning a retirement dinner.
Assassin?
I think I just figured it out.
- The Bishop files.
- Where?
My office.
Closet.
It' il just take a second.
I' il send a security officer down.
No, hey, you guys... have better things to do than to rummage through my office, right, Chuck?
[Hanging Up Receiver]
You were right.
It rained.
What about these?
- Burn 'em.
- What is this about?
Money.
Free trade.
Microchips.
Toaster ovens.
And what does that have to do with you?
Nothing.
Get me Digger Gibson' s number.
Shit!
Agency' s looking for a reason to let the Chinese kill Tom Bishop.
No!
Ah, they shut down my secure line -- last day and all.
Thanks.
Aw, well -- [Clears Throat]
It' s classified.
Do you mind?
Oh!
Uh, right.
There' s nothing there.
It' s not in English?
- It' s not in English either.
- This fax just came in a few moments ago, sir.
Yeah.
So, sir, you and Muir came up together, right?
Mm.
How well do you know him?
Not really.
Do you trust him?
He' s a man who got the job done.
Is he on the job now?
Office of Security, Hong Kong.
Ten to seven this morning, a call originated from station to Muir' s home.
He knew about Bishop before he got here.
And he played dumb.
Yeah, this is Harker.
I need confirmation on all calls... in and out of Nathan Muir' s office.
Gee, I' m hungry.
Hong Kong Herald.
- Digger Gibson, please.
- One moment, sir.
Hello?
Gibby, old boy.
Nathan!
To what do I owe this honor?
Still have contacts at CNN?
I got something for you.
Talk to me.
How about "C. I. A. operative caught in the act ofespionage"?
- Can you get that on the air?
- That' s not gonna be easy.
Come on, Gibby.
- [Chuckles]
- Give me 30 minutes.
- Yeah.
I remember seeing something about Bishop in my South American box, but it wasn' t there.
Those op files downloaded yet?
Let' s go with this.
Bishop' s recruitment.
Yeah.
Well, back then, recruitment took time.
Bishop was evacuated with the last of them on the 30th of April, and that gave me a month to do my homework.
I talked to his neighbors, his teachers, his mom -- scoutmaster --
Pulled his dad' s records from the Pentagon.
Then started to move some pieces around on the board.
Your valleys and your farms
I had his C. O. give him just menial duties... with non- English- speaking personnel.
And I kept him in limbo about even the possibility of going home.
[Rock Guitar]
This consignment is a complete misdirect.
It needs to go to Military H. Q in Mannheim.
You understand?
- These mist- covered mountains
But my home is the lowlands
Uh, sorry sir.
It' s Bishop.
Sergeant Bishop?
Oh, Christ.
Of course!
[Woman]
Yeah, hi.
Sandy, this is Tom Bishop.
Tom, right?
- Yes, sir.
- Tom.
How are you?
Nice to meet you.
- Sandy?
- My second wife.
- Second wife?
- He asked me what I was doing in Berlin, and I told him I was there as a military liaison of a sort.
It' s good to hear an American voice again, I' il tell you that.
I' il bet, I' il bet.
What are you doing for Christmas?
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
Central Intelligence?
Train you as an agent.
You' d be working for me.
Mostly undercover.
Europe?
Wherever the action is.
What if I preferred... to just go home?
That' s okay.
It' s fine.
I can probably make arrangements for you to end your tour of duty in San Diego.
In which case, I' il presume you' il forget we ever had this conversation.
All the way home I' il be warm [Chuckles Softly]
The next day, we started his tradecraft.
The technology gets better every day, and that' s fine.
But most of the time, all you need is a stick of gum, a pocket knife and a smile.
[Man]
Guten Morgen, meine Herren.
Today we' re going to be discussing a radio set.
Not just any radio set, but a Russian radio set.
Every building, every room, every situation is a snapshot.
While I' m sitting here talking to you, I' m also checking the room, memorizing it.
The people.
Then I ask the question,
"What' s wrong with this picture?
[Shouting]
- without looking, without thinking.
- Without thinking?
It' s just like breathing.
You breathe, don' t you?
Always carry cigarettes and a lighter too.
Great ice- breaker.
- Eine Kaffee, bitte.
- Zwei.
Okay, I want you to listen, but I want your concentration to be on something different.
Anything else, so you don' t react.
Understand?
Yes.
So when do I get my first assignment?
When I decide you' re ready.
- What is your name?
- Michael Sandville.
The suit in the kitchen.
- Threat?
- Wait, how' d you see that?
Ah!
- See that apartment building?
- Yeah?
Know anyone who lives there?
No.
Within five minutes, I want to see you standing on one of those balconies.
Come on.
- Did you serve in Vietnam?
- No, I did not.
- Favorite color?
- Why don' t we discuss it over coffee?
You just lost ten seconds.
Solicit information from someone.
Gladly.
The guy reading the menu.
Don' t look at him.
- He wasn 't reading the menu.
- He' s not reading at all.
Threat?
Only to the hostess.
You just gave her four pieces of personal information... for one dubious, impersonal fact.
Just trying to find out where she got that dress.
Where are you from?
When' s your birthday?
You know everything about me.
I don' t know a thing about you.
Okay, what did you tell her?
Three, tomorrow' s your girl' s birthday, and four, you have no taste in women' s fashions.
What if she were an asset?
You told her four lies that now have to be true.
Okay.
I thought spies drank martinis.
Scotch, never less than 12 years old.
Is that right?
Agency rules?
My rules.
All right, so what else?
What else do I need to know?
Put away some money so you can die someplace warm.
Don' t ever touch it.
Not for anyone.
Ever.
Okay.
Is that it?
Don' t ever risk your life or your career for an asset.
If it comes down to you or them, send flowers.
He was a natural.
look him straight in the eye, and ask him to go back... to the place he just fled and spy for us.
He got so good at it he could close in a single afternoon, send the guy out with a smile.
Let me get this straight: you allowed a contract agent to develop assets?
He was that good.
I thought he' d make a fine case officer someday.
Let' s get on with it.
I' d like to hear whatever you can offer about...
Operation Rodeo.
Rodeo?
Hold transcription, hold tape.
I' il be right back.
You know, this would go a lot faster, you guys, if you' d tell me a little something about the op.
What' s it called?
Sideshow?
What about it?
- How' d you come by this information?
- Just stuff we learn in the field.
Sorry about that.
Okay, where were we?
I think we were talking about...
Operation Rodeo -- right, Chuck?
You' re on.
My East German contacts... discovered that we had an unidentified mole in the embassy.
We had the ambassador in our crosshairs, until some information leaked when he was out of the country.
So that just left one possibility.
- Ah, Ann.
- Hello.
- [Muir]
Yeah.
Bishop was involved in a small but integral part of the operation -- going East to bring across an East German functionary named Schmidt.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Ah, fuck!
The passport' s in the glove box.
There' s some vodka.
Spill it on your coat.
If they stop us, don' t say a word.
Remember, you' re drunk.
- And where is Mrs. Muir?
- Patricia left me and filed for divorce.
Oh, I' m so sorry, Nathan.
How is it I always say the wrong things?
- Patricia?
Yeah, my third wife.
- My God, how many wives have you had?
- Four.
You want to hear about them, or Bishop?
- [Young Woman]
Yeah?
He' s the ambassador.
Why don' t you go over there and say hello to him?
Okay.
Okay?
Your scotch is older than she is.
Am I supposed to feel bad about that?
They know.
They have my family already, I know it.
If they knew, they would have stopped us.
Tomorrow, your wife, your kids, will all be safe in Munich.
- I gotta make a stop.
- What?
- It' s a scheduled stop.
I gotta make a phone call.
- They follow you.
Friedrich, it' s all taken care of, okay?
If they ask, tell 'em I got sick.
Why don' t we go outside?
I' m sure we won' t be missed.
I wish I could.
I have to stay near the phone.
Working on a Saturday night?
Are you bringing someone across?
- Bitte.
- Yes?
- Vodka did me in.
I' m comin 'home.
- Throw out the bottle.
- Repeat that?
Throw out the bottle.
They know.
They don' t know.
They don' t fuckin 'know.
They' il be waiting.
Drop as close to checkpoint as possible.
- Negative, we' re comin 'across.
- No.
That' s an order.
- [Whispering]
They will kill him.
Change of plans, Friedrich.
No.
You will drive me across, just as you said.
If I do that, they' il kill us both.
This way, we still have a chance.
You' re a liar.
This way, you still have a chance.
I can' t help you.
- Just get out of the car.
- I will not get out.
Get out!
- I will not get out!
I will not!
No!
No!
No!
Get out.
Get out!
Please.
My wife.
My children.
I can' t help you!
Nathan, what happened?
What went wrong?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
Actually, one thing.
Ever.
What?
I gave you an order, you take it.
You don' t ask why.
Those ten seconds on the phone could have blown the op.
The op was bringing Schmidt across!
The op was setting up Ann Cathcart.
And your end had to look legit.
What are you telling me?
Schmidt was bait?
- Yes.
- Nathan, they executed him on a shitty cellar floor!
It could have been you.
Let me tell you something about Schmidt.
He went to the Russians a week ago, and said he had a contact, an American.
- Somebody he could use.
- Don' t tell me that.
You didn' t look in his eyes.
Don' t tell me that!
He was your asset.
Somebody you used for information.
Aw, Jesus Christ!
You don' t just trade these people like they' re baseball cards.
It' s not a fuckin 'game!
Oh, yes, it is.
That' s exactly what it is.
And it' s no kid' s game, either.
This is a whole other game.
And it' s serious and it' s dangerous -- and it' s not one you want to lose.
Nathan, we killed this man.
We used him, and we killed him.
Okay, then you gotta help me understand this one.
You -- Nathan, what are we doin 'here?
Don' t give me some bullshit about the greater good.
That' s exactly what it' s about.
Because what we do is unfortunately very, very necessary.
And if you' re not willing to sacrifice scum like Schmidt... for those that want nothing more than their freedom, then you better take a hard look at your profession, my friend.
Because it doesn' t get any easier.
Why did you use me?
Do you want to walk?
Walk.
You should have told me about the op.
I did.
And listen to this, because this is important.
If you had pulled some stunt over there,
I wouldn' t come after you.
You go off the reservation, I will not come after you.
Fuck your rules, Nathan.
Okay.
But tonight, they saved your life.
Can we have the relevant files on Ann Cathcart?
Ann Cathcart' s body was found... in the lobby of a cheap hotel in East Germany, just two months after she defected.
Yeah.
Beaten to death.
- Vopos never solved the case.
- And Bishop was in Berlin when this happened.
We were both in Berlin -- Do you recall Bishop' s reaction... to the news that Ann Cathcart was dead?
Motive and opportunity.
Nathan, you should leave here knowing that we' re looking into every possible scenario.
What' s "Sideshow"?
You don' t need to know.
Why are you trying to burn Bishop?
Troy?
Hold transcription, hold video.
Sideshow was a bugging op.
Listening to government offices in eastern China.
- The trade talks?
- Mm.
And you' re afraid the lid to the cookie jar is gonna slam shut on our hand?
Oh, come on, guys!
Chinese need trade status more than we need to give it.
That' s not necessarily so.
Twenty- four hours after capture, Bishop' s allowed to start talking.
That gives you, what?
Ten, twelve hours to make a trade.
Come on.
You' re on the clock.
He doesn' t know anything.
Bishop wasn' t on Sideshow.
He wasn' t working for us.
He was arrested during a rescue attempt... at a prison outside Su Chou.
- Who was he after?
- Don' t know.
[No Audible Dialogue]
For more on this late- breaking story, we go live to Hong Kong.
It has been confirmed that the Chinese claim... to have arrested an American operative for the C. I. A.
While the State Department remains quiet, official sources say that the individual, working out of American consulate in Hong Kong, was captured in an act of espionage.
If confirmed, this comes at a bad time for an administration... which is in the middle of trade negotiations with China.
The U. S. government is in the process of negotiating his release.
We are so fucked. of the situation as it develops.
- This is Frank Nall, live in Hong Kong.
- Guess that limits our options.
I want to know what you have to say about this, and I want it on the record.
When I was a kid, I used to spend summers on my uncle' s farm.
And he had this plow horse that he used to work with every day.
He really loved that plow horse.
One summer she came up lame, and could barely stand.
The vet offered to put her down.
You know what my uncle said?
No, Muir.
What did he say?
He said, "Why would I ask somebody else to kill a horse that belonged to me?"
Get me Peter Brody at the FCC.
I don' t care.
Just get him.
Looks like Bishop' s gonna be okay.
Good.
- What about the flag?
- Keep it.
Something to remember me by.
You know where to store this stuff, right?
Yeah.
What do I do with the storage key?
If I need it, I' il send for it.
I' il send you a postcard.
- From where?
- Not a chance.
You' d show up and try to clean the place, and scare the native girls away.
I wish.
I' il be working for Andy Unger down the hall.
You' re gonna miss it.
You know that, don' t you?
Thank you.
Mm- hmm.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mm- hmm.
Thank you.
For more on this story, we go live to Hong Kong.
And, in a late- breaking development of the incident reported earlier, rumors that Tom Bishop, an alleged C. I. A. operative, had been captured in an act of espionage, now appears to be a hoax.
Tom Bishop died 14 months ago.
While the C. I. A. has made no official comment, sources close to the agency have confirmed Bishop' s death late last year.
The discredited story has been attributed... to an overzealous member of the Chinese government, who leaked the false information in the hopes of undermining the current U. S. trade negotiations.
This is Frank Nall, live in Hong Kong.
- [Gasping]
- Mr. Muir?
Told you you' d miss it.
Who do you trust in military intelligence?
I co- signed Martha Rayburn' s car loan.
Listen, Gladys.
I gotta buy some time here.
I' m gonna need Imagery Analysis fora military prison near Su Chou.
And if you use the phones, don' t use these.
Any chance I could lose my job over this?
Good.
I didn' t want to work for Andy Unger anyway.
I know who it is.
I know who Bishop was after.
Well, so do we.
But do you know why?
I mean, if anybody knew the back story,
I mean, it would, well, uh,
It' s just that it would make a congressional hearing really worth watching.
By the way, that' s not in the op reports.
Muir, you' re not cleared to be in here.
Relax, Kappler.
If I didn' t have clearance, how did I get in?
Where' s this report?
I just came from the seventh floor, and there' s some people pretty disappointed it hasn' t arrived yet.
Hold on!
What report?
You were at the briefing.
I' m talking about Tom Bishop.
Bishop went rogue.
Yeah, and they were gonna... pull him out until somebody up there -- and I' m not gonna say who -- said that your department claimed there weren' t enough resources.
Who said that?
Look, I can buy some time while you pull this together.
Now, Operation Sideshow.
That' s near the prison, right?
Near Su Chou.
China.
Come on.
Any air support?
P' eng Hu Islands.
Commander Wiley' s outfit.
Forty minutes from Su Chou Prison.
Oh, hey,
I' m having a little retirement dinner party tonight.
- Services library.
- Sure.
I didn' t know you liked me.
What was that all about?
What did Muir want?
What?
He was just talking.
- What about?
- His party.
I don' t think you' re invited.
[Phone Ringing]
Hello?
It' s me.
- Where are you?
- First floor coffee shop.
- Imagery Analysis.
They' ve got every angle on the prison... you could want, collecting dust.
Gladys?
Get me whatever they have.
That' il have to go through Folger' s office.
I' m aware of that.
I also need info on an outfit of ours in the P' eng Hu Islands.
- Commander Wiley' s outfit.
- Muir?
Muir, wait up.
And call Kappler in the map room.
- Tell him my party' s cancelled.
- Your party?
[Elevator Dings]
What' s that?
I said, we' re gonna need you upstairs a bit longer.
You got something in your teeth.
Harker says you might care to enlighten us on information that' s not in your op reports?
I just want to help out.
Is it relevant to the issue at hand?
I know who Bishop was after.
Elizabeth Hadley.
Pull up what we have on Hadley.
Intended to be clean and efficient in aplace that was any thing but.
By '85, the place was a nightmare.
- = ***** = - Created & Spell Checked by HxHPRC
Thanks to Jack1st!
HxHPRC:
Enjoy your hours!
Carmen, Juni, time for bed.
- Did you brush your teeth?
- I already did.
- Juni, don' t forget to brush -- - I am, I am.
All right, all right.
OK, warts.
Yeah.
It' s good.
It' s fine.
OK.
Well, lights out.
Bedtime story first.
What story do you want to hear?
Hmm.
I haven' t told that one in a while.
You probably remember that better than I do.
- Want to hear a story, Juni?
- I' m listening.
OK.
Once upon a time... there was a man and a woman.
- And they were both spies.
- Yes.
She from one country, he from another.
She had a very important mission assigned to her.
- He was her mission.
- Correct.
Her mission was to take him out.
No.
Uh, take him --
Oh, you mean...
I shouldn' t be telling you this.
Go on.
- You have to understand... these were dark and confusing times.
INGRlD:
Out off ear... a new kind of soldier was created -- brilliant, brave soldiers... whose greatest weapons were their minds.
Those men and women were spies.
They were masters of disguise.
They could sense danger a mile away... and through their work... wars were ended before they even started.
[Electronic beeping]
The only things spies were truly afraid of... were other spies -- enemy spies.
So, sometimes, one spy' s mission... was to make the enemy disappear.
He was the assignment that changed her life... but when the moment finally came... to carry out her mission...
He was different than she expected.
Sure, he was charming and intelligent... but he was unexpectedly honorable... and it made her realize... how years of working with detached emotion... had taken its toll.
So they kept contact... through lunch dates -- very discreet.
After all, they were on different sides... so they could never be seen together.
Dinner dates followed... wherever their mutual travels took them.
And they fell in love... and they decided that, together... they would embark... on the most dangerous mission of all time.
What?
They decided to marry.
CARMEN:
INGRlD:
Oh, yes.
On her wedding day... she felt like she would rather brave... a thousand deadly missions... than go through with what she was about to attempt.
Why is that?
Well, marriage is a mission so complex... that only the most courageous and slightly insane need apply.
There' s such an amazing series of obstacles... one has to navigate to keep a marriage together -- much less family -- that it frightened even her... a hardened and experienced secret agent.
But when she saw him... standing there with no doubt whatsoever... so assured of his decision... so enamored with what they were about to do... she took his hand...
looked deep into his eyes... and said the two most dangerous... most trusting words you can say to anyone.
CARMEN:
What?
INGRlD:
CARMEN:
Oh, that' s so cool.
Then the problems started.
INGRlD:
Now, there was always some faction... that wanted at least one of them gone.
[No audio]
So, they retired... settled down... had a few kids.
In a way, they exchanged... one life of adventure for another... trading espionage for parenthood -- a mysterious and compelling mission in its own right.
And they' re better off.
The end.
No "happily ever after"?
I said they were better off.
It needs monsters.
Is that right?
Do you want me to look at your --
I put the medicine on.
OK, munchkin.
Good night.
Mmm.
Ours.
How many nights, I wonder... do you send the children off to bed with nightmares?
Carmen asked for the story.
That life is over now.
We are consultants, not spies.
Hmm?
Carmen' s been skipping school twice a month.
- Why?
- I don' t know.
Yeah.
Diego somebody and Renaldo?
No such beasts.
It turns out, the other kids pick on him.
He has no friends.
[Beep]
They' re keeping secrets from us, Gregorio... and I think it' s our fault.
They' ve gotten this from us.
We have good reason to keep secrets.
If we told them we were spies... they' d have visions of danger every time we leave the house.
Speaking of secrets... what are you working on over here?
Oh, nothing important.
It' s just...
Why do we have to do this every morning?
We already have P. E. at school.
You gonna hang there all day, scaredy cat?
I can' t help it.
Uhh!
Hurry up!
- Uhh!
- Whoa!
Uhh!
[Moaning]
You just fell a thousand feet.
You' re a pancake.
- Am not.
- Are too.
[Crash]
Butterfingers.
We' il see about that.
Donnagon?
He' s missing.
Is this what you were hiding last night?
I didn' t want to worry you.
GREGORlO:
Juni, why do you watch that show?
Why?
Because that' s all you ever do.
Play its video games and watch the tapes.
Do you know why, son?
So, always remember, whatever you do... believe in yourself.
CARMEN:
What' s this, a self- portrait?
[As Carmen]
"What' s this, a self- portrait?"
- Mom, he' s mimicking me!
- "Mom, he' s mimicking me!"
Carmen, leave your brother alone.
Juni, stop talking like your sister.
- Stop it.
- "Stop it."
It' s hideous.
- Well, talk to him.
I designed it myself.
Today we' re very excited, because today... we have a new character!
We found him snooping around the castle last night.
I want you all to meet Donnamight.
Dad, when Floop makes a toy out of that one...
I want it!
[Speaking in alien tongue]
- Honey!
Juni.
Anybody gives you a hard time in there... remember, you are a Cortez.
What' s so special about being a Cortez?
Lots of things.
Hey, it' s the mummy.
Nice- looking bandages, mummy.
Just stop it, man.
When I' m talking to you, you listen.
Ay yi... yi... yi.
Nice dolls.
Have a good day, son.
Show them who' s boss.
Can I help you with something, macho?
I said, "Can I help you with something, chief?"
I didn' t think so.
My dad was gonna beat up your dad.
No more secrets.
Deal?
Definitely soon.
I even have to share a room with him... because he' s so afraid of being alone.
"Watch out for Juni, Take care of Juni.
"Show Juni right from wrong."
GlRL:
You' re so right, Carmen.
What' s so special about being a Cortez?
I wish I could go away to your world, Floop.
MR. LlSP:
I thank you all... for attending today' s demonstration.
Year after year... we pay outrageous sums of money to several inventors... to come up with our technologies.
Mr. Floop is one such visionary.
However, his inventions are somewhat questionable... and, therefore, need to be evaluated.
You promised us an army, Mr. Floop... but our first billion dollars bought us only this -- mutated secret agents.
The mutative process and brain wipe... caused their minds to turn to mush.
I have found little use for them except as novelties on my -- well, my children' s show, currently rated number two?
What the devil are these finger men?
They' re called Thumb- thumbs.
Very capable robots.
All thumbs.
FLOOP:
Mr. Lisp, I think you' il enjoy this.
Through that door, an awesome power will emerge.
You will have but a moment to disarm it.
Seven...
Five...
Three...
FLOOP:
One.
Johnny?
[Lisp groaning]
- I had to.
He' s my son.
Are you sure?
Actually, I designed him.
I built him!
His name is...
X- 5- 2- 4- 9- 5, the second.
This is your big idea?
Robot kids that look like my children.
The president' s daughter?
An almost- exact replica.
Sometimes in order to think big... you have to think small.
Through physio- electrical imaging...
I can make them look like anyone... yet the cunning and intelligence... of the world' s greatest espionage agents... all rolled into tiny packages I call "Spy Kids."
Tell me, Spy Kids... with your vast stores of knowledge... what are four of the five physiological indications... that a human being is lying?
[Speaking in robot language]
They' re not quite finished.
Missing one crucial element.
Missing what?
Their brains.
These buckets of bolts will never pass as children!
We have a schedule to keep, Floop -- a window of opportunity that' s closing fast!
We will be back in two days to pick up our army... or we' il take whatever you do have, cut our losses... and lay your entire silly empire to waste!
No more time.
Escort Mr. Lisp back to his chopper, children.
Ow!
- That was brilliant, sir.
- Thank you, Minion.
Now all I have to do is make them work for real.
Ow!
- On assignment.
Several OSS agents are missing, including Donnagon.
No ransom, no demands.
They just disappeared.
After nine years, you are accepting an assignment?
- Why?
- In a word, Devlin.
Devlin himself called?
GREGORlO:
He called, asked me to go in.
I' m going with you.
GREGORlO:
We can' t both leave.
I want to go on an adventure.
I want to save the world.
Again?
Honey, it' s old.
If it wasn' t for Donnagon and the other agents...
I mean, clearly.
You' re gonna turn me down?
[Whispering]
Ingrid, Ingrid... Ingrid.
What -- what about the children?
- Uncle Felix!
Hey, churros, how are you?
Last time I saw you, you were this big.
What' s up?
Here, take this bag.
That' s what families are for.
That' s what I hear, anyway.
Do I know you?
[Engine starts]
- Feels, uh -- - Like old times?
Yeah.
Missing OSS operatives.
Agents Ingrid and Gregorio Cortez en route.
Well, it' s good to hear those names again.
- Good evening, Ms. Gradenko.
- Hello, Greg.
- And Mrs. Cortez.
GRADENKO:
They' re being loaded into your central now.
Scan the area.
All right.
Why don' t we call them?
They' il be getting up for school soon.
They should know what we' re up to.
You' re right.
Oh, our first time out in nearly a decade... and all we can do is think about the children.
You should see OSS escort, Agent --
[Scrambled transmission]
[Static]
Believe in yourself.
Picking up a -- a TV satellite?
And you, Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez.
No.
I know who that is.
That' s -- We' ve got a follower.
Not for long.
Watch this.
What' s that?
Uhh!
And this is what Carmen would look like as a Fooglie.
[Alarm sounding]
- Oh, my God.
Is this a fire drill?
Put these on quickly.
We don' t have any time to --
Follow me.
Come on!
Follow me!
There' s a lot for you to know and very little time to explain.
Uncle Felix!
The first of which is, I' m not your uncle.
Your parents are international spies.
Good ones, but they' ve been mostly inactive... for the last nine years.
What are you talking about?
I was assigned to protect your family... but something' s gone wrong.
I have to take you to the safe house.
My parents can' t be spies.
They' re not cool enough.
That' s cool.
According to the coordinates... in my locating device, they' re being taken to Asia... or South America.
Go in there.
I' il be right back.
And if you' re not?
Hit the blue button to seal the door... and the green button to go.
[Muttering]
Cool!
Carmen!
You' il have to go to the safe house without me.
- Go now!
- Felix, look out!
Yeah!
Tell them the Third Brain lives!
You must find --
Felix, behind you!
Get them!
Felix!
Get them!
Press the blue and green buttons.
We can' t leave Felix behind!
Oh, yes, we can.
Quick!
Here' s the green button.
Blue button first!
Juni!
Blue, then green!
You gotta seal the door!
I can' t find the blue!
CARMEN:
JUNl:
What are those things?
I don' t know, but they' re catching up!
- Where' s the gas pedal?
Don' t touch anything!
[Electronic sounds]
You weirdo!
JUNl:
How do you work this thing?
CARMEN:
It was programmed to take us to the safe house.
- Aah!
[Carmen and Juni scream]
Juni?
Juni?
Juni, what are you doing down there?
[Screaming]
I' m coming to get you!
Uhh!
Uhh!
Aah!
Wow!
Welcome to the N. I. X. Super Guppy.
Juni, don' t touch anything.
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Destination -- safe house.
- Juni, close your eyes.
- Why?
Just keep them shut, all right?
OK, you can open your eyes now.
Thanks.
I just don' t want you crying all over me.
We' re never gonna see them again, are we?
[Chiming]
Refreshments ready.
Would you care for a lullaby, sir?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[Chittering]
Characters from Floop' s TV show.
They' re prisoners.
We need the Brain, Minion.
We' re running out of time.
Don' t worry, sir.
Ingrid and Gregorio Cortez... are the only agents I know of that never had a weakness...
MlNION: but times change.
Now they have two.
[Theft alarm beeping]
CARMEN:
That' s the safe house?
Looks more like an outhouse.
Your name?
Carmen Cortez.
Your full name, please.
It' s too long.
Your full name, please.
Carmen Elizabeth Juanita Costa- Brava Cortez.
My name' s a pass- code?
[Machines beeping]
Empty.
How safe is a safe house if there' s nothing to eat?
"Machete' s Buddy Pack"?
Emergency cash?
From every country.
I think I' d better take all of that.
Check it out.
Thank you, Carmen!
We' il see them again.
Just like they said.
So this time we' re supposed to believe them.
Let' s stop worrying about the children.
They still wear diapers.
Only one is in diapers and only at night.
It' s not that unusual, OK?
This is why I never wanted to go on another mission.
Are you blaming me for this?
An hour ago you seemed happy to be back in the game.
An hour ago I was not a prisoner of war.
OK, we' re a little rusty, that' s all.
This is one way to find out who' s behind all this.
If I can just get the pressure right.
She' s still got it.
How did you do that?
Hey, hey, hey, what about me?
[Floor cracking]
- Those were the days.
- Yeah.
No.
Aah!
Sweetheart!
Oh!
Oh!
Clever.
Let' s go.
Where are we?
You gotta give him points for imagination.
Whoa!
[Ticking]
Fifteen minutes to escape.
Finally, we can eat!
So, you are Floop.
You watch my show!
GREGORlO:
No, my son does.
Carmen and Juni.
But not your daughter...
Carmen, isn' t it?
And Juni?
Your children will be joining us soon.
Careful!
Heh heh!
Where are the OSS agents you' ve taken?
Twelve years ago... they were part of a research team for the OSS... attempting to create a synthetic intelligence... a compendium of spy knowledge, if you will.
Research since destroyed.
If the OSS destroyed its research... it was for a reason.
We all have our reasons, hmm?
Someone else who could rebuild it.
Isn' t that right, Mr. Corteth?
[Gulps]
I think he' s gonna be a best- seller.
And just in time for the holiday rush.
I will never, ever build anything for you.
Whoa!
"How To Be A Spy."
Author unknown.
[Voice booming]
Gosh!
"A good spy uses his head."
Got that?
It' s the first one in the book.
Ew, gross!
- What do you see?
- You.
Very funny.
Whoa!
Maps and readouts.
CARMEN:
That' s the computer screen.
It' s a database of some kind.
The wedding from the story.
It was theirs.
They should' ve told us about this stuff.
What about Diego and Renaldo... and all your make- believe friends?
Should Mom and Dad know about that?
What about all the days you skip school?
- Want them to know about that?
- That' s my business.
Uh, Carmen?
Go knock it against something.
"A good spy has no fear."
Guess you can' t be a spy.
"in the mind- set of the opponent."
Mind- set.
That' s exactly what we' il do.
I think it' s up to us.
You with me?
- With you what?
- Find the OSS like Felix said.
- OK.
- Then let' s go.
I' m Ms. Gradenko.
We work for your parents.
"We?"
I can understand if you don' t trust me...
You were a baby when we first met.
Sorry.
You see?
We' re all on the same side.
We' re here to protect you.
My mom has a bracelet like that.
OSS standard issue.
We all have one.
OSS?
You work with my parents?
Yes.
Now, please listen closely.
Open your ears.
You father was able to send one last communique this morning... before he disappeared.
It consisted of five letters.
O... P!
But you' re wrong.
Fabulous Floop would never do that.
In fact, recognize these?
Floop' s Fooglies.
I' ve got toy versions.
CARMEN:
You mean these mutants are captured secret agents?
- Told you Floop was a freak.
We' re trapped!
Floop is a madman!
Save us!
Floop is a madman!
Help us!
Save us!
A cry for help.
Will Floop do that to Mom and Dad?
Definitely.
Unless he gets something your father helped develop.
If there' s anything you can possibly remember --
- The Third Brain lives.
- What?
Felix gave us a message to deliver to the OSS... and here you are.
Here I am.
What' s the message?
The Third Brain lives.
Carmen... you have just joined the ranks of women spies in the OSS.
Brilliant.
- Now.
Where does the Third Brain live exactly?
Did Felix tell you that?
I don' t think he said.
GRADENKO:
He didn' t say?
Are you sure?
Search the place.
You were at our house?
Oh, no!
Oh, my God.
It exists.
Oh!
It' s so beautiful!
She' s working for Floop!
Fly this to Floop' s castle immediately.
- Yes, ma' am.
[Instruments whirring and clicking]
GRADENKO:
You don' t even know what those things are.
I know they' ve heavy.
GRADENKO:
Aah!
Send in the thumbs.
How do you work this thing?!
Ah, ah, ah!
Don' t you want to see your parents... you little brat?
- Unh!
- Whoops!
Get back!
What' s wrong with you?
Aah!
Uh- oh.
Uh- oh.
What?
Where did you go?
I' m right behind him!
Where are you?
I' m toast.
Give me back that brain!
Get away from me!
Tough guy, huh?
Whoa!
Oh, my sister!
Oh, brother!
I can' t hold on much longer!
Get a grip, you big baby!
- I' m slipping!
- Hang on, butterfingers!
I' m not gonna make it!
We' re almost there!
- I' m not gonna drop you!
- Oh.
What would you do without me?
Cut!
Whoa!
What does it need, Minion?
- I don' t -- - My show!
That thing that will take it to number one.
I can feel it... but I can think straight enough to figure it out.
Floop, you' re spending too much time on this program.
You should be more concerned with our grand diabolical plan.
- The army of robot children.
This hardware gets in the way of my creative abilities.
You lost the children.
Not only did they escape... they took the Third Brain with them.
It exists?
Completely.
Cortez lied to us.
Send our best Thumbs.
Sir, if you want to catch a criminal... you send a criminal.
If you want to snare a spy ---
Please speak English, Minion!
I' ve been baking under those studio lights.
Send a child.
That is brilliant, Minion.
Thank you... sir.
[Horns honking]
[Computer beeping]
Some locating device.
I can' t even figure out where the coordinates point to.
Who makes this?
"Machete Products."
What are you doing?!
That' s our bargaining chip on getting Mom and Dad back.
This is what Floop wants.
I think Mom and Dad would want this destroyed.
How do you know what they want?
Until this morning, you didn' t even know who they were.
For now.
Why are you still wearing that?
They could be tracking us.
Don' t start pointing fingers at me.
I didn' t do anything stupid, stupid.
You better stop calling me names.
Or what?
Or I' m gonna call you names.
I hate that!
Thought I ditched you.
Why are you dressed like a geek?
[Speaking gibberish]
Get away from me.
Hey!
Put me down!
[Motors whirring]
Always wanted to do this.
Juni!
Put me down!
CARMEN:
Destroy the brain!
Destroy it!
Ohh.
[Juni moaning]
[Kids shouting]
They took the brain?
Yeah, but I took her necklace.
- She didn' t even notice.
- They weren' t very smart.
Yours couldn' t even speak.
"One of five hundred..."
Floop could have hundreds of these flying around.
The Third Brain makes them smart.
They' re building an army.
We' ve got to save Mom and Dad.
Only they can stop the robots.
But who' s gonna help us?
We had it working.
A synthetic intelligence as smart as any spy.
Why don' t you go ahead and tighten that brain up?
The Third Brain System.
The OSS Director realized it was too dangerous... if the wrong forces found the technology.
We were ordered to destroy it.
Why keep that a secret from me?
To protect us from something you destroyed?
[Clears throat]
All these secrets from me, from the children.
It has to stop.
I' m sorry.
He wants the Brain.
If we save our children, we risk the world.
So what in the world do we do?
Thanks for taking us this far, but... this is all we got.
[Tires screeching]
What are we doing here?
Dad' s code name must be Hombre.
So, this must be Machete.
We' re getting help from Dad' s best man?
What are you working on?
World' s smallest camera.
Ah, but it sees you.
You sell counterintelligence stuff here?
- Come back with your parents.
- We can' t.
We need something fast that can get us here.
Who are you?
Carmen Elizabeth Juanita Costa- Brava Cortez.
Gregorio Cortez is our father.
You will leave my shop.
Because I never want to hear my brother' s name again.
You' re our uncle?
Our real uncle?
'Cause we already got a fake uncle.
Gregorio Cortez is my younger brother.
President' s daughter.
President' s son.
Oh, good.
Prime Minister' s son.
General' s daughter.
They' re all here as planned.
I have to get back to my show now.
You must focus on the task at hand.
We have to prepare the army before Mr. Lisp arrives.
FLOOP:
I don' t think I ever did.
Explain.
The mutated agents, the robot kids.
FLOOP:
So what?
I think that' s why they' re not working.
Not yet they' re not.
But, you see...
I now have the Third Brain.
MlNION:
Minion?
And you, Floop, have served your purpose.
[Gasp]
You' re a secret agent, aren' t you?
What makes you say that?
According to the database, you' re always traveling... and no one knows what you do for a living.
I think we all have uncles like that.
"Another fine Machete product."
MA CHETE:
That' s correct.
But you sell them to both sides, good and bad.
That' s why Dad hasn' t spoken of you in all these years.
Ever sell stuff to Floop?
Why?
CARMEN:
Our Mom and Dad -- your brother -- are his prisoners... and if we don' t do something to help... something really bad' s gonna happen to them.
I don' t see why you won' t help him!
You think I want to baby- sit my brother the rest of my life?
"Watch out for Gregorio.
Take care of Gregorio.
"Make sure Gregorio knows right from wrong."
Not anymore.
Machete' s not responsible for nobody but Machete.
But that' s not what family is.
We' re just brothers.
Look how they ended up.
Now, the only thing that will get you... to Floop' s castle fast enough... is this.
It' s tiny.
It' s built for one passenger, but it' s fast.
Will you go?
No.
- For your brother?
- No!
Then how about for us... your niece and nephew?
No.
- How about if -- - No!
No!
Pass the pig intestines.
I' m not eating that now.
- Can I have a -- - No!
Thank you for letting us stay here... while we ponder our parents' terrible fate.
If you weren' t a Cortez, I wouldn' t be doing this much.
No.
Ready?
CARMEN:
Now we' re talkin '.
[Snoring]
[Whispering]
What are you doing?
Shh.
It' s just a reflex.
Look.
He' s still asleep.
CARMEN:
Oh, yeah.
What can I do to help?
Remember that spy plane up on the roof?
Yeah.
No!
Hurry up!
He' s coming!
He' s coming!
JUNl:
CARMEN:
Thanks for the plane!
OK, so here' s the new plan.
We get to the castle, rescue Mom and Dad... then somehow stop Floop... from using the brain on the robots... before they' re sent out to dominate the world.
- Think we can do that?
[Alarms sounding]
I didn' t do anything.
OK.
Airspeed -- fine.
Altitude -- fine.
Autopilot... failing?
Oh, great.
Another fine Machete product.
Take control.
We have to go to manual.
Now!
You were supposed to read all the instructions!
You skipped a chapter, meathead.
Better stop calling me names.
Pull up, booger breath!
CARMEN:
Go ahead.
You got nothin 'on me, warthog.
Try me... diaper lady.
Hope you' re wearing one now.
- How long have you known?
- Since forever.
Mom made me swear not to mention it.
So now we' re even!
CARMEN:
Oh, now you' ve done it!
I knew this was gonna happen!
CARMEN:
JUNl:
But now it' s balanced!
Landing gear.
No landing gear.
We' re gonna crash!
CARMEN:
We' re gonna drop.
Get your regulator ready.
Com systems check.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Let' s try that cave over there.
The water' s warmer in here.
Oh, I just peed.
- Sorry.
A Thumb- thumb.
A real live --
What did you do to him?
Machete' s electroshock gumballs.
But I don' t trust wrappers.
Come on.
Over here.
Juni, come on.
What are you doing?
World' s smallest cameras.
I just placed them all over the main hallways.
- Sweet.
- Thanks.
Thumb- thumbs and Fooglies coming up the south hall.
Got an idea?
Yeah.
Agent Donnagon?
[Speaking backwards]
Thanks.
- I got it.
- What' d he say?
I' il play it backwards.
They' re in the dungeon.
Hurry.
Uh- oh.
Thumb- thumbs -- everywhere.
Let' s see if they like bubbles.
We' il be back for you, fellow agents.
Sknaht!
All robots please report... to docking bays four, five, and six for immediate loading.
This is the ventilator shaft here.
But the dungeon' s on the other side of the castle.
[Whispering]
I think they' ve gotten smarter... since the last time we met.
ALL:
- Can you make it?
- I think so.
Come on.
- Carmen!
- Find Mom and Dad!
I hope this leads to the dungeon.
You there.
What' s that on your hands?
Warts, aren' t they?
Oh, great.
FLOOP:
Do you know why you have sweaty hands?
From being scared all the time.
You don' t look very scared to me.
That' s because I' m mad.
You kidnapped my parents... made psycho robot children, and swallowed up my sister.
But I didn' t want any of that.
- I thought Floop was a genius.
- You did?
You watch my show?
More than you know.
Alexander Minion.
Agent Cortez.
Wonderful to see you again.
- You know him?
- Yeah.
He was on the Third Brain Project... until I noticed he was trying to inject... his own ideas into the system.
I turned him in.
He was thrown out of the OSS.
But not to worry.
I have something else in mind.
What do you think you' re going to accomplish by doing this?
I' ve always been methodical, goal oriented.
Psychotically so.
I' m not afraid of you, Alex.
MlNION:
They' il still be able to see you.
Uhh!
I trust this time Floop will have a success to show us.
The Fabulous Floop is away on other business, sir.
Your army is complete.
The ultimate destructive force is now within your grasp.
I' il believe that when I see it.
Welcome back, Ms. Gradenko.
It' s good to be back, Alex.
Let' s never have children.
- So Minion is the evil one.
But I will be blamed.
You have every reason to be disappointed in me.
So what would you do if you could shut this thing off... and get out of here?
It' s impossible.
It can only be turned off from the outside.
Just suppose.
FLOOP:
I' d stop the robot army and hope... that the world would forgive me.
[Gagging]
You' re my hero, Floop... so I' m gonna help you, then you' re gonna help me.
- Minion must be stopped.
- Just one thing.
My show -- what does it need?
I know it needs something desperately... but I can' t figure it out.
Maybe you can?
It needs children.
Hold still.
Now let' s stop Minion.
Must be stopped!
This one' s for my sister!
Oh, Juni.
Hola.
Juni?
- Mom!
It' s dad.
You' re here!
- What' s he doing here?
How did you get here?
It' s OK.
It' s OK.
I know.
We' il talk about it when we get home.
- Running off to Belize.
- What?
You went where?
Let' s just talk about this when we get home.
No, no, no, no.
You can tell me everything now, OK?
Is that where you want to be, free from your family?
I used to.
No, I didn' t.
But I might be able to change him back.
MlNION:
MlNION:
Your faith and your patience... have meant more than you know.
FLOOP:
Minion!
This is Floop.
Please report to the robotics lab at once.
LlSP:
I thought you said Floop wasn' t here.
He' s not.
A problem, Mr. Minion, as in mucho grande problemo.
I' m gonna... just be a moment.
Minion!
Floop?
Where are you?
Behind you.
What do you think you' re doing?
You' re supposed to be in line with the others.
You' re supposed to be with the others.
- Stop that.
- Stop that!
- Stop that this instant!
Stop that right now!
No.
Clever boy you' ve got there, Cortez.
Very clever indeed.
He gets that from his mother.
Can I offer some sort of truce in exchange for your daughter?
Spoken for.
There you are.
Didn' t see her.
Yaah!
INGRlD:
Yes.
Promising.
Thank you.
- You couldn' t possibly.
- No, but you can.
Don' t let go, Ingrid.
Hey, you two, come on.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Come on.
We have to keep the army from leaving the castle.
Our only chance is to get to the control room... and hope that their missions have not been programmed.
And what if they have?
Then there' s no one on earth who can stop them.
- One at a time.
Go.
Left, left, left, left!
That way.
Where' s Mom and Dad?
Your doppelgangers have them.
Can you shut them down from here?
It' s too late.
The Third Brain is linked not only to them... but to all the robot children.
- Can' t you remove it?
- So don' t.
- That would take weeks!
- Just two words.
- A binary switch.
So they would define right as wrong...
Come on.
But it' s not that simple.
Figure it out.
Teach them to be good.
Have a seat, Mr. Lithp.
You' il be more comfortable.
It' s Lisp.
My army, Ms. Gradenko, is the only comfort I need.
Minion?
What happened to your head?
Oh, don' t worry.
Mom!
Dad!
Careful.
So are we.
Oh, shi... take mushrooms.
Whoa!
Ohh!
Ohh... ohh... ohh... ohh... ohh... ohh...
Let' s go.
Should have known you were behind this.
[Giggles]
Ms. Gradenko... I think.
Oh, it' s me, all right.
I owe my new look to your children.
LlSP:
Certainly.
Argh!
Your parents were so easy to capture... and you' re not any better.
Poor little Juni.
Defenseless and weak.
Juni!
Don' t listen to her.
You' re not worthless!
You helped Floop realize he was good, not bad.
You talked to the Fooglies and saved Mom and Dad.
You' re strong, Juni!
You' re strong!
Ow.
Puny... Juni.
It' s all over.
Instant cement!
That should hold them.
- Let' s go find Mom and Dad.
- Good idea.
- Mom, Dad!
- Juni!
INGRlD:
Carmen, Juni, close your eyes.
We don' t want you to see this, OK?
[Punching, socking]
- Carmen?
GREGORlO:
I think I got it.
Tell us.
I' il take the hundred on the right.
Ingrid, you take the hundred on the left.
Carmen, hundred center- left.
It' il work.
It' il work.
That' s 500 total, Dad.
We need one more person.
- Hello, little brother.
Children!
Tear them limb from limb.
How?
I' il have to teach them.
- Haaah!
Minion!
Tell them to put me down!
Their mind is a mirror now, sir.
Anything we tell them goes in one ear and out the other!
Why did you come back?
For the same reason I left.
You know what?
I don' t remember that reason.
[Sniffling]
It' s OK, it' s OK.
It' s OK.
Let it go.
Let it go.
He' s fine.
He' s gonna be fine.
Latinos.
That' s it.
That' s it.
So, what did you teach them?
It' s not what I can teach the children... but what you taught me.
You won today, Juni, and not because... you were the biggest or the strongest... but because you were pure of heart and of mind.
And now the robots have learned that as well.
Thank you.
And we didn' t do one thing right.
Nope.
We did two things right.
There is something that we have to tell you.
INGRlD:
Your father and I... we' re secret agents.
We have something to tell you.
We' re secret agents, too.
Eight more incidents witnessed today... all in different countries... of yet another group of children... who' ve done some incredible good deeds.
It seems that a day doesn' t go by... that another amazing child... performs some outstanding act of charity... or community service.
Who are these children... and why are they so good at being good?
I gotta have the business section.
I thought you closed down your shop.
CARMEN:
Boys, can we please stop fighting?
Hey, kids, it' s time for...
Good morning, my children.
Today, I' d like to introduce you... to two new characters on our show...
Carmenita and Junito.
Ah, Cortezes.
An emergency assignment has come up in the Far East.
I need you on it right away.
Oh, sorry, Devlin.
We haven' t talked about this as a family yet, so...
GREGORlO:
Ey?
No, this assignment is for Carmen and Juni.
You up for it?
Keeping a family together... that' s difficult.
Then we' re gone, you' re safe
Are gonna save the world
Move fast, everything' s all right
And make no mistake
Look out, always in danger
- Look out - Spy Kids
It' s a cruel, cruel world
And some mean, nasty people
It' s a cold, cruel world for the nasty boys and girls
You can dream
Our world is gone now...... smashed by the wars.
Now I am the keeper of his body...... embalmed here, in the Egyptian ways...
I followed him as Pharaoh, and have now ruled 40 years.
I am the victor...... but what does it all mean, when there is no one left to remember...... the great cavalry charge at Gaugamela?
Or the mountains of the Hindu Kush...... when we crossed a 100, 000- man army into India...?
He was a god, Cadmos...... or as close as anything I' ve ever seen.
Tyrant, they yell so easily.
I laugh.
No tyrant ever gave back so much.
What do they know of the world, these schoolboys?
It takes strong men to rule.
Alexander was more, he was Prometheus, a friend to man.
He changed the world.
Before him, there were tribes, and after him... all was possible.
There was suddenly a sense the world could be ruled by one king...... and be better for all.
It was an empire, not of land and gold, but of the mind.
It was a Hellenic civilization...... open... to all.
But how can I say it?
How can I tell you what it was like...... to be young, and to dream big dreams?
Anything.
In his presence, by the light of Apollo... we were better than ourselves!
Truly..... I' ve known many great men in my life, but only one colossus.
And only now, when old...... do I understand who this force of nature really was.
Or do I?
Did such a man as Alexander exist?
Of course not!
We idealized him, make him better than he was.
Men... all men, reach and fall...... reach and fall.
In the East...... the vast Persian Empire ruled almost all the known world.
In the West, the once- great Greek city- states...... Thebes, Athens, Sparta, had fallen from pride.
For a hundred years now, the Persian kings had bribed the Greeks...... with their gold to fight as mercenaries.
It was Philip, the one- eyed, who changed all this.
Uniting tribes of illiterate sheepherders from the high and lowlands...... with his blood and guts, he built a professional army...... and brought the devious Greeks to their knees.
He then turned his eye on Persia...... where it was said the new "Great King" Darius, himself...... on his throne in Babylon, feared Philip.
It was from these loins of war that Alexander was born, in Pella.
Dreams are yours for keeping Pella, Macedonia
Some called his mother, Queen Olympias, a sorceress...... and said that Alexander was the child of Dionysus...... others Zeus.
But, truly, there was not a man in Macedonia...... who didn' t look at father and son, side- by- side...... and wonder.
Her skin is water
Her tongue is fire.
She is your friend.
Take it.
If you hesitate, she will strike.
Remember that, hmm?
Never hesitate.
Yes.
They are like people.
You can love them for years...... feed them, nurture them,... but still... they can turn on you.
He calls me a barbarian.
Philip makes a mockery of Dionysus every night!
Women are the only ones...... who know Dionysus.
My little Achilles.
- Mama!
What is it you want?
Not here!
Proud bitch!
I' m still your king!
Sheepherders?!
The blood of Herakles runs in my veins!
You are nothing but a drunken whore!
Shut your foul mouth, you ten- titted bitch from Hades!
Do you think people respect you?
You think they don' t know your bastards?
I told you not!
I told you not!
You' il obey me.
You' il obey me, or I' il kill you with my own hands!
No!
No, stop!
Papa!
Your Majesty!
No!
Never!
In my womb, I carried my avenger!
In the world he grew up to...... I' ve come to believe it was in friendship that Alexander found his sanity.
When you' re in the front ranks of a battle...... facing some Northern barbarian tribe...... courage won' t be in the lining of your stomach, Nearchus.
It' s in the heart of a man!
You don' t need to eat everyday...... or until you' re full, Ptolemy!
You don' t need to lie in bed in a morning...... when you can have some good bean soup, Cassander, after a forced night march!
Come on, Alexander.
Come on!
Do you think it' s because of your father?
The first rule of war is to do what you ask your men to do...... no more, no less!
Well done, Hephaistion!
Come, come, come.
You did well, but you lost.
Now, both of you, congratulate the other.
Go on!
Would you want me to let you win, Alexander?
You' re right
But I promise you I will beat you one day, Hephaistion.
It was said later that Alexander was never defeated...... except by Hephaistion' s thighs.
Although an inferior race... the Persians control at least four- fifths of the known world.
But is it possible... that the source of Egypt' s mighty river Nile...... could rise in these distant mountains of the Outer Earth?
If so, an experienced navigator could find his way here...... by this river east, down into the great plains of India...... out into the Eastern Ocean at End of the world...... and by this route, up the Nile...... back to Egypt, into the Middle Sea, and home...... to Greece.
Now if only these frogs could look outward...... and act on their favored position at the center, Greece could rule the world!
Why is it, master...... in myth these lands you speak of are known?
India, where Herakles and Dionysus traveled...... all these men who went East, Theseus...... Jason, Achilles, were victorious.
Why?
Unless there was truth to them.
Tales of Amazons?
No, Alexander.
Only common people believe these tales, as they believe most anything.
We are here precisely to educate ourselves against such foolish passions.
But if we are superior to the Persians, as you say, why do we not rule them?
It has always been our Greek dream to go East.
The East has a way of swallowing men and their dreams.
Yes?
Out with it!
Why are the Persians so cruel?
That is not the subject for today, Nearchus.
But, it is true that the Oriental races are known for their barbarity...... and their slavish devotion to their senses.
That is why we Greeks are superior.
We practice control of our senses.
Then what of Achilles at Troy, master?
Was he not excessive?
Achilles simply lacks restraint.
He dominates other men so completely that even when he withdraws from battle...... crazed with grief over his dead lover, Patroclus...... he seriously endangers his own army.
He is a deeply selfish man!
Would you say that the love between Achilles and Patroclus is a corrupting one?
When men lie together in lust, it is a surrender to the passions...... and does nothing for the excellence in us.
Nor does any other excess, Cassander...... jealousy among them.
But when men lie together and knowledge and virtue are passed between them...... that is pure and excellent.
When they compete to bring out the good, the best in each other...... this is the love between men that can build a city- state...... and lift us from our frog pond.
Philip brought such as Aristotle from Athens to educate our rough people.
And growing more ambitious, he now planned the invasion of Persia.
Back to the phalanx with you, I' il ride him myself!
No one will ride that beast, Your Majesty!
He' s been beaten far too often.
My noble King, he' s a high- spirited animal, yes.
High- spirited and worthy of, of Philip of Macedon!
Why would I want such a beast?
I already have a wife!
Do I seem so old?
He' s too nervous for battle.
Sell him for meat.
Buy him for me, Father!
I' il ride him.
And if you don' t?
I' il pay for him myself!
With what, your singing voice?
I' il pay you!
His mind is broken.
He can be ridden...... by me!
If you can rule that horse, I' il make him yours...... at half the price.
That horse' il kill him, Philip.
Will he?
Perhaps she' il make a musician out of him!
The boy doesn' t have the craft.
He could hurt himself.
He' il have to figure that out for himself.
You don' t like your shadow, do you?
It' s like a dark spirit coming up to get you.
It' s just a trick of Apollo' s.
He' s the god of...... the sun.
But I' il show you how to outwit him...... you and me together.
That' s what I' il call you...... strong and stubborn
Bucephalus and Alexander.
Come now, let' s ride together.
Attalus!
For Zeus' s sake, he beat you, man!
Show them.
My son!
My son!
He' s my favorite!
Why?
Because he loved Patroclus, and avenged his death!
And his fate?
That he must die young, but with great glory.
Yes!
He could live a long life, but there would be no glory.
Your mother encourages you.
But there' s no glory without suffering and this she will not allow.
One day I' il be on walls like these.
Prometheus stole the secret of fire and gave it to man.
It made Zeus so angry, he chained Prometheus to a rock in the Great Caucasus...... and each day his eagle pecked out the poor man' s liver.
Each night it grew back again...... so that it could be eaten the next day.
Miserable fate.
Why?
Anyway...
Oedipus tore out his eyes... when he found out he' d murdered his father...... and married his mother.
Knowledge that came too late.
Medea, she slaughtered her two children in vengeance...... when Jason left her for a younger wife.
My mother would never hurt me.
It' s never easy to escape our mothers, Alexander.
All your life, beware of women.
They' re far more dangerous than men.
Even after he accomplished his Twelve Labors...... he was punished with madness, slaughtered his three children.
Poor Herakles
Great Herakles!
All greatness comes from loss.
Even you, the gods will one day judge harshly.
When I' m king like you one day, Father?
Don' t rush the day, boy.
You risk all.
My father threw me into battle before I knew how to fight.
"Now you know!"
I hated him then, but I understand why now.
A king isn' t born, Alexander, he' s made...... by steel and by suffering.
A king must know how to hurt those he loves.
Ask any of them!
Fate is cruel.
No man or woman can be too powerful or too beautiful without disaster befalling.
They laugh when you rise too high...... and crush everything you' ve built with a whim.
What glory they give, in the end, they take away.
They, they make of us slaves.
Pregnant so soon...... the little whore.
He will marry her in the spring, during Dionysus' Festival...... and when her first son is born...... her sweet uncle, Attalus, will convince Philip...... to name the boy his successor, with himself as Regent
And you...... you will be sent on some impossible mission...... against some monstrous northern tribe,... to be mutilated in one more meaningless battle over cattle.
And I, no longer queen, will be put to death...... with your sister and the remaining members of our family.
I wish...... sometimes you could see the light, Mother.
Truth is, he' s taken nothing from you that you' ve not been long without.
The only way is to strike.
Beget a child of pure blood, he would be one of them, not mine...... and he would have no choice but to make you King!
There is still Kynnane.
Eurydice was perfect. lf your father, that pig, had not ravaged her first!
Say nothing more of my father!
Say nothing.
You' re right
Forgive me.
A mother loves too much.
Who shall I sing to sleep at night anymore?
I wish we could spend more time together.
Like we used to, when you were the sweetest boy.
There' s never been time, Mother.
Since I was a child, I' ve been groomed to be ever the best.
My poor child, you' re like Achilles...... cursed by your greatness.
Take my strength.
You must never confuse your feelings with your duties, Alexander.
A King must make public gestures for the common people.
I know.... but you will be nineteen this summer... and the girls already say you don' t like them, you like Hephaistion more.
I understand.
It' s natural for a young man
But if you go to Asia without leaving your successor, you risk all.
Hephaistion loves me... as I am...... not who.
Loves?
Loves?
In the name of Dionysus...... understand how Philip thinks...... for your own sake.
Your life hangs in the balance!
Stop!
I' m his only worthy son!
You crazed woman.
He' d never hurt me.
Even if Eurydice had a boy, he' d be twenty before he' d let him rule!
Yes, and you would be 40!
Old and wise...... like Parmenion...... and Philip' s young son would be 20!
Like you now...... but raised by him, his blood.
He will never give you the throne now, Alexander.
Never
Come, Alexander, drink this sadness away!
If only thirst could quench sorrow, Ptolemy.
There' s only one thing better than winning a battle, son...... and that' s the taste of a new woman!
You' il find it far sweeter... than self- pity.
What' s your name, darling?
- What' s your name?
I love you, my little imp!
And I love you, Cleitus.
I' il sleep in my grave, Hephaistion.
While alive, I prefer dancing.
Who' s your new friend?
- There' s your new friend.
A toast,
A toast!
I drink to our Greek friends...... and to our new union,... Macedonia and Greece...... equals in greatness!
And to Philip, our King... without whom this union could not be possible.
Come, Attalus, leave some damn air in the Hall!
And last, I drink to... the King' s marriage to my niece, Eurydice...... a Macedonian Queen we can be proud of!
To Philip and Eurydice...... and to their legitimate sons!
What am I, you son of a dog?
Shut up!
Shut up, all of you!
Not some public brawl!
Apologize, by Zeus, before you dishonor me!
You defend the man who called my mother a whore and me a bastard
And I dishonor you?
You listen like your mother!
Attalus is my family now, the same as you!
Choose your relatives more carefully!
Don' t expect me to sit here and watch you shame yourself.
You insult me!
I insult you?
A man not fit to lick the ground my mother walks on?
Shame?
I' ve nothing to be ashamed of, you arrogant brat!
And I' il have as many sons as I want!
And there' s nothing you or your Harpy mother can do about it!
Why must you think everything I do and say comes from my mother?
Because I know her heart, by Hera...... and I see her in your eyes!
You covet this throne too much!
Now we all know that she- wolf of a mother of yours wants me dead!
This is the wine talking.
Leave the boy, it will wait till morning.
Now!
I command you... apologize to your kinsman!
Apologize!
No kinsman to me.
Good night, old man.
And when my mother remarries, I' il invite you to her wedding.
You bastard!
You' il obey me!
Come here!
And this is the man who is going to take you from Greece to Persia?
He can' t even make it from one couch to the next.
You' re exiled, you bastard!
Banished from the land!
You' re not welcome here!
You' re no son of mine!
Everything suddenly changed for him.
His father, King Philip, was murdered...... and Alexander, at 20...... became the new ruler of Macedonia.
And breaking their treaties with us, dismissing Alexander as an untried boy...... several Greek city- states rose up in revolt...... much to Persia' s delight...... and perhaps sponsored by their gold.
Truly, Alexander could love like no other...... but to betray him was to rouse a vast and frightening anger...... and he massacred several thousand of the men of that tragic city, Thebes, and sold the survivors into slavery.
This, as intended, stunned and defeated the Greeks.
And though, in the end, he treated most populations with magnanimity,... it is these exceptions -- Thebes, Gaza in Syria...... and later Persepolis in Persia, and others...... that are always remembered by those who hate Alexander and all he stood for.
At 21, Alexander invaded Asia...... with an army of 40, 000 trained men and liberating one city- state after the other...... he conquered all of western Asia, south to Egypt...... where he was declared Pharaoh of Egypt...... worshiped as a god.
It was in Egypt...... that the respected oracle at Siwah...... declared him the...... true son of Zeus.
He finally provoked Darius himself to battle...... in the heart of the Persian Empire, near Babylon.
40, 000 of us against 250, 000 barbarians.
It was the day Alexander had waited for all his life.
Alexander, son of a god.
I know.
I saw his eyes...
There!
In the crack of the Persian line, we' il go for the head.
Kill Darius?
The gods have brought him to us at last!
Here.
Right here, we cut the throat of the Persian army!
You' il never get within a hundred paces of him.
Have you seen the sheer size of his force?
Not if you hold them on the left, my brave Parmenion...... with your son Philotas, for just one, two hours tomorrow.
The center phalanx.
Perdiccas.
Polyperchon.
If you pin them on the walls of your sarissas here, in the center...... their cavalry will follow me out to the right.
And when bold Cassander breaks, stretching their left...... a hole will open.
Then I and my cavalry, our revered...
Cleitus, Ptolemy, and Hephaistion...... we' il strike through that gap...... and deal the death blow to Darius' s head.
Or we' il be picked apart by bandit tribes on the long journey home.
But do you understand, Parmenion...... Babylon' s my new home.
Use your numbers well.
We should attack tonight when they least expect us.
I didn' t cross Asia to steal this victory, Cassander.
No, you are too honorable for that.
No doubt influenced from sleeping with "Tales of Troy" under your pillow.
But your father was no lover of Homer' s.
The hand of his daughter in marriage?
When has a Greek ever been given such honors?
Too long!
Do you forget that the man who murdered my father lies across the valley floor?
We' re still not really sure if it was Persian gold behind the assassination --
Parmenion, you know that' s not true!
Your father taught you never to surrender your reason to your passion.
Now I urge you:
Regroup, fall back to the coast, raise a larger force!
I would...... if I were Parmenion, but I am Alexander.
And no more than Earth has two suns, will Asia bear two kings.
These are my terms...... and if Darius isn' t a coward who hides behind his men...... then he' il come to me tomorrow.
And when he bows down to Greece...... Alexander' il be merciful.
By Ares' chains, he' s got balls, men!
I mean, give the man his due, Parmenion!
And lads, feast tonight...... for tomorrow we will dine in Hades.
To whom do you pray?
Phobos.
Fear?
I' ve come to believe that fear of death drives all men, Hephaistion.
This we didn' t learn as schoolboys.
It is the cause of all our misfortunes.
- So, mighty Crateros...
- Your Majesty!
Are you ready for tomorrow' s dawn?
It' s been too long coming, if you ask me.
Good!
Fear makes men fight better.
Post your sentries alertly, but rest them well.
Don' t you worry, General, I' m known to sleep with my eyes open as a baby' s arse.
Only because someone might steal his loot, sire.
- The gods are with us, Your Majesty.
We' il stain the ground with Persian blood, my king.
I' ve always believed, Alexander..... but, this seems so much bigger than us.
Did Patroclus doubt Achilles when they stood side- by- side at the siege of Troy?
Patroclus died first.... if you were to fall, even if Macedonia were to lose a king...... I will avenge you...... and follow you down to the House of Death.
I would do the same.
On the eve of battle, it' s hardest to be alone.
Then perhaps...... perhaps this is farewell...... my Alexander.
Fear not, Hephaistion.
We are at the beginning.
Blood makes the world rise.
Blood makes the rain fall.
And in blood...... all men are born...... and die.
Blood is the food of the gods below.
Come, Bucephalus.
Today we ride to our destiny.
Phalanx!
Attention!
I remember you the day you jumped the siege tower at Tyre, you were a giant!
And today?
How will you fight?
Dexippos, by Athena...... how far was it you threw your man wrestling at the last Olympic Games?
Will you match it with your spear?
And Timander...... son of Menander, a great soldier to my father.
I still mourn your brother, Addaios, who died so bravely at Halicarnassus.
What an honored family you descend from, Timander.
You fight for them today!
You' ve all honored your country...... and your ancestors.
And now we come to this most distant place in Asia...... where across from us...... Darius has at last...... gathered a vast army
Who is this great king who pays assassins in gold coins...... to murder my father, our king...... in a most despicable and cowardly manner?
Who is this great king, Darius, who enslaves his own men to fight?
Who is this king...... but a king of air?
These men do not fight for their homes.
They fight because this king tells them they must.
We are here today as Macedonian free men!
Some of you...... perhaps myself...... will not live to see the sun set over these mountains today.
But I say to you...... what every warrior has known since the beginning of time, conquer your fear...... and I promise you, you will conquer death!
When they ask why you fought so bravely, you will answer, "I was here this day at Gaugamela...... for the freedom...... and glory...... of Greece!"
Zeus be with us!
Four columns, go!
Where does he go?
I don' t know, Majesty.
Envelop him, Bessus.
Hephaistion, go!
He makes a mistake, Pharnakes.
Yes, great King.
Steady on the left, lads!
Bend if you must, but never break, and keep watching the cavalry on the left!
Pick up the pace!
Prepare to repel chariots!
Go!
Forward, men!
Infantry, clear.
Hold your position!
We must fall back to the gully, Father.
Where is he?
We' re far too thin!
Move!
Yes, sir!
Ride!
Ride!
To Alexander!
Drive for the hole!
Back and to the left!
Back and to the left!
And if he won' t listen, then survive me and avenge this betrayal!
Pay attention, lad!
Your father still watches over you!
Find your horses!
Go!
Go!
Go all night and catch Darius at dawn!
Provision the horses!
Alexander!
They' ve overrun the flank!
Parmenion' s crumbling!
Alexander, if you chase him, you risk losing your army here!
And if we capture him, we gain an Empire!
You can run to the ends of the earth, you coward...... but you' il never run far enough!
May I tend to your wounds?
No, Hermolaus, not now.
There' s far worse than me, go to them.
Your Majesty!
You' re very brave.
What shall I call you?
Glaukos!
- And where' s your home? - illyria.
Let your body go loose.
Think of home now.
Be brave again, Glaukos... and you will live on in glory.
Alexander.
The Persian Empire, the greatest the world had yet known, was destroyed
And Alexander at twenty- five was now king of all.
Alexander once said to me:
We are most alone when we are with the myths.
And thus, it came to pass, in a dream as mythical... to all Greeks as Achilles defeating the Trojans, at this one glorious moment in time...... Alexander was loved by all.
But in the end, I believe...... Babylon was a far easier mistress to enter than she was to leave.
Imagine the minds that conceived this.
With architects and engineers like these, we could build cities such as we' ve only dreamed!
Aristotle may have called them barbarians, but he never saw Babylon.
We have enough gold here to support another three generations of Macedonian armies.
And Macedonia would soon corrupt, Cassander.
Wealth in great quantities brings the crows.
Not for the men who fought, I trust?
We' il pay them well, Antigonous... but not as mercenaries for future services.
Now you sound like Philip.
Philip never saw Babylon.
No, he didn' t, Hephaistion.
I know you think me a stiff old sod, but whatever our differences...... know this day your father would be very proud of you!
Thank you, Parmenion.
I ask you to forgive me my own anger, my pride.
They, too, blind me.
You overvalue us.
For as long as Darius breathes, he is the legitimate King of Asia...... and I but the King of Air.
But he has no power, Alexander!
He' s lost in the mountains with no army.
As long as he' s lost, Philotas, he can be believed in.
Only when he' s found will it be decided.
It seems you' ve already made up your mind.
We must finish what we failed to do at Gaugamela.
We must hunt Darius down, if it be, to the ends of earth!
- That was not your father' s mission!
- And I am not my father.
Have you so quickly forgotten fortune favors the bold?
What is this?
No wonder Darius fled when he had this to come back to.
I venture one for every night of the year.
Help me, Aphrodite!
How will I ever go back to Lysimache after this?
I advise you not to touch, Leonnatus.
Here, I' il take care of it for you.
Aristotle was perhaps prescient.
Do these images fool us with their beauty and degrade our souls?
Great King, Alexander.
The Princess of the Thousand Roses...... and eldest daughter of the formerly Great King, Darius...... Stateira
Noble Alexander...
... I come...... to beg for the lives of my sisters...... my mother, my grandmother.
You are not wrong, Princess Stateira.
He, too, is Alexander.
Please.
I plead for my family' s lives.
Sell me as a slave, Great King, but please do not --
Look now, in my eyes...... Princess...... and tell me... how would you like to be treated?
As I am... a Princess.
Then so be it.
You and your family shall be treated as my family.
You shall live in this palace as long as you choose.
Have you any other requests for me, my noble Princess?
No.
Everything I wish, I have...
Requested.... requested.
You truly are... a Queen.
Yes, she would be a perfect match for you...... but you do nothing.
Three months you have been in Babylon...... and leave me in Pella at the mercy of your enemies...... of which you have many.
Antipater, accustomed now to the power that you have given him...... I must watch him grow stronger.
I am certain that he communicates secretly with Parmenion, who is dangerous, but beware, most of all, of those closest to you.
They are like snakes, and can be turned.
Even Cleitus, your father' s favorite...... and Ptolemy, your friend, yes.
But beware of men who think too much.
They blind themselves.
Only Hephaistion do I leave out.
But all of them you make rich...... while your mother and yourself you leave in generous poverty.
Why won' t you ever believe me?
For they are dark, Alexander...... so dark...
But in you...... the son of Zeus, lies the light of the world.
Your companions will be shadows in the Underworld...... when you are a name living forever in history...... as the most glorious, shining light of youth...... forever young, forever inspiring.
Alexander the Great!
I can only help you, for they know if they harm you...... they will face my wrath as Queen of Babylon!
It' s a high ransom she charges for nine months' lodging in the womb.
Joy?
When I' m the cracked mirror of her dreams?
Stay with me tonight, Hephaistion.
I' il take my own bath.
Thank you, Bagoas.
The generals question your obsession with Darius.
Naturally.
They want only to return to their homes, rich with gold.
But I' ve seen the future, Hephaistion.
These people want...... need, change.
Aristotle was wrong about them.
How so?
Look at those we' ve conquered.
They mate in public!
What can they think, or sing, or write, when none can read?
But as Alexander' s Army, they can go where they never thought possible.
They can soldier or work in the cities...... the Alexandrias, from Egypt to the Outer Ocean.
We could connect these lands, Hephaistion, and the people.
Some say these Alexandrias have become extensions of Alexander himself.
They draw people into the cities so as to make slaves of them.
But we freed them, Hephaistion, from the Persia where everyone lived as slaves!
To free the people of the world...... such would be beyond the glory of Achilles, beyond Herakles... a feat to rival Prometheus...... who was always a friend to man.
They suffered greatly.
Oh, we all suffer.
Your father, mine.
They all came to the end of their time, and in the end, when it' s over, all that matters is what you' ve done.
You once said, "The fear of death drives all men."
Are there no other forces?
Is there not love in your life...... Alexander?
I wonder sometimes, if it' s not your mother you run from.
So many years, so many miles between you.
What is it you fear?
Who knows these things?
When I was a child, my mother thought me divine, my father weak.
Which am I, Hephaistion?
Weak or divine?
All I know is, I trust only you in this world.
I' ve missed you.
I need you.
It is you I love, Hephaistion...... no other.
You still hold your head cocked...... like that.
I' ve stopped that.
You strike me still, Alexander.
And you have eyes like no other.
I sound as stupid as a schoolboy about it.
You' re everything I care for...... and by the sweet breath of Aphrodite...... I' m so jealous of losing you to this world you want so badly.
You' il never lose me, Hephaistion.
I' il be with you always.
Till the end.
The campaign in the northeast of Persia...... turned into a hard guerilla war of almost three years.
We chased Darius towards Bactria...... but missed taking him by hours.
He was dying when we found him, sire.
He asked for water, he drank and died.
The Great King Darius had been betrayed by his own commanders.
Fully honoring his corpse...... Alexander hunted down these commanders into unknown lands...... crossing even beyond the River Oxus into Sogdia...
We fought them as far as the unknown Steppes of Scythia...... where only legendary heroes had once trod.
The surveyors told us we were now on the borders of where Europe and Asia meet.
In fact, as our new maps showed, we were totally lost.
Here Alexander founded his tenth Alexandria...... and settled it with veterans, their women...... and any who would dare the frontier life.
Unable to accept defeat in any form...... Alexander persisted in breaking every tribe that resisted... until the day he received the head of his last enemy in surrender.
For Alexander, there could be no pretender to the throne of Asia...... which now included all of Sogdia and Bactria.
It was here that Alexander made one of his most mysterious decisions.
Her eyes tell me she cares for you, Alexander...... perhaps too much.
In the ways of my country...... those who love too much lose everything...... and those who love with irony...... last.
Your father must be turning in his grave.
After all this time, a hill chief' s daughter.
This girl has spirit!
But what' s the point, Alexander?
Just take her as your concubine.
Damn you, Philotas!
Then half your nobles have sisters who' d make fine Macedonian mothers.
To take an Asian as my Queen, not a captive, is a sign of deep respect.
It will, more than anything, bring us together, unify us.
You insult Macedonia!
Exactly!
What can be won, Alexander?
We' ve achieved that!
For what?
To give these people cities?
To found cities and expand our reach is not to drift.
- What benefit to Macedon?
- It' s far richer than before!
How dare you, Nearchus!
General Nearchus to you, boy.
Philotas!
Alexander, I' ve known you since you were born.
I supported you at your father' s death.
At the very least, for Zeus' sake...... and in respect to the Council that chose you King...... give us a Macedonian heir!
A Macedonian heir!
You have been heard clearly.
And after the wedding, you' il take two brigades back to Babylon...... where I look to you, and Antipater in Greece...... to maintain our Empire and supply this expedition.
I pray to Apollo you soon realize how far you' ve turned from your father' s path!
Damn you, Parmenion, by the gods and your Apollo!
War was in my father' s guts, wasn' t overripe and reason like yours!
He never lusted for war, Alexander, or enjoyed it so!
He consulted his peers in council...... among equals, the Macedonian way!
He didn' t make decisions based on his personal desires!
I' ve taken us further than my father ever dreamed!
Old man, we' re in new worlds!
Alexander, be reasonable!
Were they ever meant to be our equals?
Share our rewards?
You remember what Aristotle said.
What would a wedding vow ever mean to a race that has never kept their word to a Greek?
Aristotle be damned!
By Zeus and all the gods, what makes you so much better than them, Cassander?
Better than you really are?
In you and those like you is this.
What disturbs me most is not your lack of respect for my judgment...... but your contempt for a world far older than ours.
And so ten years after his mother' s insistence he marry a Macedonian...
Through our union, Greek and barbarian may be reconciled in peace.... the most powerful man in the world, took a girl of no political significance.
Why?
Some say it was for alliance with the tribes...... others the desire for a successor.
And yet others said Alexander truly fell in love.
I doubt that any of us ever saw further than the pools of those black eyes.
Alexander...... special for you.
I toast this great Army that has given so much!
I pronounce all your debts paid forthwith from the Royal Treasury!
And in honor of my bride...... my beautiful bride...... we recognize the many women who' ve shared the long, hard road with us...... and grant them dowries befitting a proper marriage!
And lastly...... lastly, the gods demand no less of us...... that your children with these women be given...... a proper Greek education and military training, under our protection...... so as to be the new soldiers...... of our Kingdom...... in Asia!
I found it in Egypt.
The man who sold it to me said it came from a time...... when man worshipped sun and stars.
I' il always think of you...... as the sun, Alexander.
And I pray your dream will shine on all men.
I wish you a son.
You' re a great man.
You love him?
He is Hephaistion.
There are many different ways to love, Roxane.
Come.
You have no fear.
It' s fitting.
A man searches for a woman at Earth' s Top...... and finds her.
The myth becomes real.
Yeah...... great man!
You, I kill now.
End it!
I would do --
I would do the same.
I' il die a fool, for this...... love.
My life is now yours.
You will have my son.
Who is this woman you call your Queen, Alexander?
With your breeding?
Already she makes enemies with her strong, clumsy nature.
Do not confuse us.
I was never a barbarian, as Philip said.
We are of Achilles' royal blood!
Zeus is your father!
I understand, she brings you some happiness...... but hear me when I tell you, act and act soon!
After seven years, people wonder, "Who is this King Alexander?"
I have given you ample proof.
Antipater daily undermines your authority.
Return to Babylon and strengthen your center...... or come home to Macedonia and reorganize,
But do not chase your dream further East.
Your life and mine depend on it.
As you, too, must face your glorious destiny...... think kindly of your mother.
Provide for me.
Protect me from your enemies when you are gone...... and remember, always,... it is I who love you more than any.
If only you were not a pale reflection of my mother' s heart.
Tell me!
Hermolaus!
Never will you find a man as devoted as I.
The conspiracy deeply upset Alexander...... not only because it involved the young pages who' d shared his dream...... more intimately...... it implicated Philotas, his companion from boyhood...... who was Captain of Alexander' s Royal Guards.
Remember me for who I am.
I do remember you, Philotas, but not as you remember yourself.
It appears to me and your peers here that the true weather of your soul is ambition.
None of us defended Philotas...
I didn' t do this!
But then again, none of us ever liked him...... and of course, his power was carved up by the rest of us.
Before he died, we tortured him to find out what his father, Parmenion, knew...... but this we never learned.
What to do with Parmenion and his 20, 000 troops guarding our supply lines...... was a far more delicate matter.
Was he innocent in this...... or had he decided to act before age further withered his power?
They' il be divided.
The men' il follow their King.
Alexander won' t be there.
Necessity required Alexander to act...
He sealed the camp within the hour of the first accusations against Philotas.
Then go, Antigonous, and Cleitus.
Three days hard riding sent Antigonous and Cleitus to Parmenion.
His soldiers accepted the finding of guilt against Parmenion...... as they understood the head of family was responsible...... for the behavior of all.
Antigonous!
Parmenion.
I remember a remark of Bagoas' once, that love eluded Alexander...... as much, if not more, than finding the End of the World.
Alexander marched an army of a hundred and fifty thousand...... across the passes of the Hindu Kush...... into the unknown.
In his dream, it was the promised route to the End of the World.
She shivers in the wind like the last leaf on a dying tree
I let her hear my footsteps
She only goes stiff for a moment
Care for a smoke?
Sure.
I' il take one
Are you as bored by that crowd as I am?
I didn' t come here for the party
I came here for you
I' ve watched you for days
You' re everything a man could ever want
It' s just not your face
Your... figure
Or your voice
It' s your eyes
All the things I see in your eyes
What is it you see in my eyes?
I see a crazy calm
You' re sick of running
You' re ready to face what you have to face
But you don' t want to face it alone
No
I don' t want to face it alone
The wind rises electric
She' s soft and warm and almost weightless
Her perfume is sweet promise that brings tears to my eyes
I tell her that everything will be alright
That I' il save her from whatever she' s scared of and take her far far away
I love her
The silencer makes a whisper of the gunshot
I hold her close until she' s gone
I' il never know what she' s running from
I' il cash her check in the morning
Just 1 hour to go.
My last day on the job
Early retirement.
Not my idea
Doctor' s orders.
Heart condition
"Angina", he calls it
It and the 35 years of protecting and serving and tears and... blood and terror, triumph that represents
I' m thinking of Aileen' s slow smile about the thick fat steak she picked up at the butcher' s today
I' m thinking about the one loose end I haven' t tied up
A young girl who' s out there somewhere helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic
Damnit, Hartigan
I won' t let you do this, you' re going to get yourself killed
You' re going to get us both killed
I' m warning you
Let go of my coat, Bob
You' re draggin me down with you.
I' m your partner
They can kill me too.
I ain' t putting up with that
I' m getting on the horn and calling for backup
Sure, Bob.
We' il just wait
Sit on our ass while that sick Rourk brat gets his sick thrills with victim number 4
Victim number 4
Nancy Callahan, age 11
And she' il be raped and slashed to ribbons and that backup that we' re waiting on will just so happen to show up just late enough for Rourk to get back to his U. S. Senator daddy
Take a deep breath, Hartigan
Settle down and think straight
You' re pushing 60 and you got a bum ticker
You ain' t saving anyone
Got a great attitude, Bob
Real credit to the force, you are
Aileen' s home waiting for you.
Think about Aileen
Heck, Bob
Maybe you are right
I' m glad to hear you' re finally talking sense
Hell of way to end a partnership
Hell of a way to start my retirement
Nancy Callahan, age 11
For all I know, she' s dead already
You' ve been a very good, Nancy
You' ve been very quiet
Don' t be scared
We' re going to be taking you home really soon
But first, we' re going to introduce you to somebody
He' s a very nice man
Half way to the warehouse where Weevil said they took her and it hits
At least that' s what I pray it is
I seek only the most lighthearted and momentary degression
The briefest indulgement in automotive pleasure... for cheap thrills.
Such shortlived durability, Mr. Shlubb
You would risk engendering an ill will on the part of our employers
Burt Shlubb and Douglass Klump 2 any- job- there- is thugs with dellusions of eloquance
This Jaguar you so pinheadedly covet temporarily remanded to our customer, though it may be remains the property of the son of Senator Rourk
Got to keep this quiet
Take them down fast
A single dent, the mearest scratch, thereupon on the before mentioned consequences of which I so recently made mention shall surely be afford us
Catch your breath.
Give your heart time to slow down
But it won' t slow down
Get over it
She needs you
Give them some privacy
Be with you in a minute, Lenny
I' m just making sure they get along really well
What kind of beast couldn' t get along with a precious little girl like this
You must be awfully scared now
But you got nothing to be scared of
All we' re going to do is have a nice little talk
That' s all.
Just a nice talk, just you and me
Don' t you cry now
Doctor said it' d be like this
Just take the pill he gave you
No need to play it quiet.
Not anymore
Breath steady old man.
Prove you' re not completely useless
What the hell.
Go out with a bang
He likes to hear them scream
I' ve seen his victims and their twisted little faces all wide- mouthed and bug- eyed frozen in their last horrible moment of living
No screams.
Either I' m just in time or I' m way too late
It' s nothing.
Barely a flesh wound
On your feet, old man
Rourk
Give it up
Let the girl go
You can' t do a goddamn thing to me, Hartigan
You know who I am
You know who my father is
You can' t touch me, you piece- of- shit cop
Look at you.
You can' t even lift that cannon you' re carrying
Sure I can
Cover your eyes, Nancy
I don' t want you watching this
I mean it baby.
Cover your eyes right now
I take his weapons away
Both of them
Hell of a way to end a partnership
For God' s sakes, don' t make it any worse
Don' t make me kill you
I' m doing fine, Bob
Never better
Ready to kick your ass
Keep it talking
By time, just a few more minutes.
Just until backup gets here
Sit down and stay down
I' il kill you if I have to
Keep his mind off the girl
Skinny little Nancy
Can' t kill her once the backup gets here
Run home, Nancy.
Run for your life
Hey.
Don' t listen to him, he' s a crazy man
A tough man you are, huh?
You stay right where you' re at
You shoot your partner in the back then you try to scare a little girl
Plug you a couple times.
Show you how it' s done
We could' ve worked something out, but you' ve blown that
Sit down or I' il blast you in half
You' re so slow, you' il never stop me
Sit down
You' il never be able to stop me
I finally sit down, just like you told me to
The sirens are close now.
She' il be safe
Things go dark.
I don' t mind much
It' s OK
She' il be safe
An old man dies.
Little girl lives
Fair trade
THE HARD GOOD- BYE
The night is hot as hell
It' s a lousy room in a lousy part of a lousy town
I' m staring at a goddess
She' s telling me she wants me
I' m not going to waste one more second wondering how I' ve gotten so lucky
I want you
She smells like angels ought to smell
The perfect woman
The goddess
I need you
Goldie
She says her name is Goldie
3 hours later and my head' s feeling several sizes too big and that cold thing happens to my stomach and I realize Goldie is dead
Not a mark on her
You' d have to check her pulse to notice those perfect breasts of hers aren' t moving like they would if she was breathing
She was murdered and I was right here when it happened
Lying next to her stone drunk, just like she was
Damnit Goldie.
Who are you and who wanted you dead?
It sure wasn' t my looks
So why the sleazy salloon
Why the kindest Goldie
The cops
They' re telling me too much
Showing up before anybody but me and the killer could know there' s been a murder
Somebody paid good money for this frame
No reason at all to play it quiet
No reason to play it any way but my way
Whoever killed you is going to pay, Goldie
Open up.
Police
I' il be right out
I don' t know why you died, Goldie
I don' t know why and I don' t know how.
I never even met you before tonight
But you were a friend and more when I needed one
And when I found out who did it it won' t be quick and quiet like it was with you
It' il be loud and nasty.
My kind of kill
And when his eyes go dead, the Hell I send him to will seem like Heaven after what I' ve done to him
I love you Goldie
Claire?
Don' t worry, Lucille.
I was just grazed
Got any beers around this place?
No way I' m giving you any alcohol
Besides, it' s not what you came here for anyway, is it
No
Go ahead.
It work' s without them
Thanks.
You' re the best
Lucille' s my parole officer.
She' s a dyke, but God knows why
With that body of her' s, she could have any man she wants
The pills come from a girlfriend who' s a shrink
She tried to analyze me once, but she got too scared
Haven' t seen you like this in awhile
Had a fight with some cops
Didn' t happen to kill any of them, did you?
Not that I know of
But they know they' ve been in a fight, that' s for damn sure
How the hell do you suppose I' m going to square this with the board
There ain' t no squaring it, not this time
This isn' t some bar room brawl or some creep with a gas can trying to torch someone
Hey hey, this is big
Settle down, Marv.
Take another pill
Hey, there isn' t no settling down
This is blood for blood and by the gallons
This is the old day, and the bad days, the all or nothing days.
They' re back
There' s no choices left
And I' m ready for war
Prison was hell for you Marv.
It' s going to be life this time
How' s waking up every goddamn day and not even knowing why you' re here
But I' m out now
It took somebody who was kind to me.
Getting killed to do it
But I' m out
I know exactly what I got to do
So you were scared, weren' t you Goldie
Somebody wanted you dead and you knew it
So you hit the salloons, the bad places
Looking for the biggest meanest lug around, and finding me
Well I' m going to find that son of a bitch that killed you and I' m going to give him the hard good- bye
Walk down the right back alley in sin city and you can find anything
That coat looks like??? serves your face
Take off
He' s new here, Marv.
He didn' t know
Katie' s my kind of joint
Nancy' s just getting started with her gig, but already the crowd' s breathing hard
Plenty of nights I' ve drooled over Nancy shoulder to shoulder with all the other losers like me
But that' s not what I' m looking for tonight
What' il it be, Marv?
A shot and a brew, Shellie, and keep it coming
Sure, honey.
You take it slow now
Most people think Marv is crazy
He just had the rotten luck of being born in the wrong century
He' d be right at home on some ancient battlefield, swinging an axe into somebody' s face
Or in a Roman arena taking a sword to other Gladiators like him
They' d have tossed him girls like Nancy back then
Show' s over, dickwad
Drink up
Now that' s one fine- looking coat you' re wearing there
You' re killing days are over, you over- the- hill do- gooder son of a bitch
I love hitmen.
No matter what you do to them, you don' t feel bad
Take it off
What?
Fine coat like that, and you' re bleeding all over it
Alright, it' s all yours
Who was it you loosers who killed Goldie?
The guy who did that... he knew what he was doing
So tell me, man, who sent you?
I don' t hear you giving me any names
So I guess when I shot you in the belly, I aimed a little too high
You keep holding out on me like this, and I' m going to have to get really nasty
It' s Telly.
Telly Stern... passed me the order
He runs the tables over at the Triple Ace Club
Thanks again
Now the damnedest thing happens
For a second I smell the angel' s smell that belonged to my Goldie
Just need my medicing is all
Bastard
You' re going to pay for what you did to me
You like talking, Louie?
How many got paid off for the frame, Louie?
How many for the kill?
It was Connely.
He set me up
He' il never talk
I don' t know about you, but I' m having a ball
Connely talks.
They all talk
And what have been your sins, my son?
Well, Padre.
I don' t want to keep you up all night, so I' il just fill you in on the latest batch
These here hands of mine, they got blood all over them
You' re speaking... figuratively
look for somebody that knows more than me and I go and I ask them
Sometimes, I ask pretty hard
That way, for instance, in fact, I killed 3 men tonight totured them first you might say I' ve been working my way up the food chain
First 2 are minnows, small time messengers
But it was Connely.
They money man who fingered you, Padre
Dear Lord, Marv.
This is a House of God
Just give me a damn name
Roark
You really are pushing your luck, Padre, feeding me garbage like that
It can' t be that big
There' s a farm out North Cross and Lennox
It' s all there
Find out for yourself.
While you' re at it, ask yourself...
If that corpse of a slut is worth dying for
Worth dying for.
Worth killing for.
Worth going to hell for
Amen
These keys say the Padre drove a Mercedes
Or at least that' s what they' re passing off as a Mercedes these days
Modern cars.
They all look like electric shavers
Goldie
Goldie
That couldn' t be Goldie
It' s my own fault, and nobody elses, that I got confused
I' ve been having so much fun I forgot to take my medicine
That wasn' t Goldie back there.
Goldie' s dead
And that' s the whole reason I' ve been doing what I' ve been doing
When you got a condition, it' s bad to forget your medicine
The cold thing, it creeps into my gut and tells me one more time it won' t let go
This is a bad place, this farm.
People have died here
The wrong way
I don' t want to fight, pooch
I got no gripe with you
Easy boy
No way I was going to use my gun on you, buddy
It' s whoever owns you, I' m curious about
Because there' s blood on your breath, and I think I know what kind
So I sniff around to see what' s burried
Here we go
Impossible.
Nobody can sneak up on me
Not a sound.
Nobody' s that quiet
Nobody except the one who snuck in that hotel room 2 nights ago
It was you, you bastard.
It was...
I found your killer, but he was better than me
Too quiet.
Too quick.
A killer born
Why didn' t he finish the job?
He keeps the heads
Lucille?
It' s not just that wolf of his
The wolfs just get scraps
Bones.
It' s him
He eats... people
He cooks them like they were steaks
Let' s get you warm
Just like they were steaks
Now he' s got both of us
It' s alright.
Take a nice slow breath
Just look at the heads on the wall
Heads on the wall.
The heads on the...
Son of a bitch.
He kept smiling that damn smile made me watch him... suck the meat off my fingers
He made me watch.
He made me watch!
Christ, I could use a cigarette
Dames.
Sometimes all they got to do is let it out and a few buckets later, there' s no way you' d know
You brought us some big trouble this time, Marv
Whoever' s behind this little thing, has his connections right in the department
Any leads?
Whoever it is, he knew I was checking out that hooker almost before I did
What hooker?
The one you' ve been obsessing over.
Goldie
I didn' t know she was a hooker
It doesn' t make any difference about anything
But I didn' t know that
She was high class stuff
Wait.
There' s a car coming
Kevin
All I' ve got is a face... and a name
I' il see you later, Kevin
Let' s go
They' re coming this way
Bastards, I' il show them
You' re not going to get any of us killed, Marv
No, don' t shoot.
Please, listen to me.
I' m his parole officer
He' s unconscious and unarmed.
So there' s no need to kill him
The target.
There' s no sign of him
Here' s a sign
That there is one damn fine coat you' re wearing
I keep coming back to that cop I just killed and what he told me
I was pretty steamed about what he' d done to Lucille
So I took my time with that son of a bitch
It wasn' t until I showed him all those pieces of himself that he said... just a name
Patrick Henry Roark.
Man of the cloth
He could' ve become President, but he chose to serve God
And along the way, he just happen to become the most powerful man of the State
He' s brought down mayors and governors like they were nothing
He even made his rotten brother a U. S. Senator without breaking a sweat
And here he' s going to get killed in the name of a dead hooker
I' m getting used to the idea.
More and more, I' m liking the sound of it
Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts
What if I' m wrong?
I' ve got a condition
I get confused sometimes
And with Lucille dead, I can' t get my medicine
What if I' ve imagined all of this
What if finally turn into what they' ve always said I was going to turn into
A maniac
A psychokiller
Can' t kill a man without knowing for sure you ought to
I' ve got to know for sure
The merchandise is on display, by the time I make my way to Old Town
For an hour or so, I ask around about Goldie
I don' t get any answers, but I know I' m bound to
Lucille said Goldie was a hooker
And if she was, she has roots here.
Friends, maybe even family
Goldie' s dead
Goldie.
Yeah, sure, right.
I haven' t eaten anything or taken my medicine for days now
No wonder I' m seeing things
Bastard
He' s crazy
Hit him again, Wendy... harder
Why did she call you Wendie?
Because that' s my name, you ape
Goldie was my sister
My twin sister
I guess she was the nice one
Where are they?
What did you do to them?
You crazy goddamn broad.
Just take a look at this mug.
Would any of you dames let me get close enough to you to kill you?
None of you would.
But Goldie...
And only she did because she thought I could protect her
And I' il bet those cops didn' t do a damn thing about those other girls tonight
But as soon as they hit me for a fall guy, they showed up, guns blazing
But they didn' t get me
And I' ve been killing my way to the truth ever since
So go ahead doll... shoot me now.
Or get the hell out my way
Nuts
OK, I better be getting all that sorted out
What the hell?
I tied those knots.
That' s my specialty
Well, sure.
I thought I might be able to talk some sense into you
And I probably would' ve had to paste you one
And I don' t hurt girls
We need a pair of handcuffs
What style you want?
I got a collection
Just give him the ones you got with you, Gail
It was a farmboy named Kevin who killed Goldie
But it was Cardinal Roark who was behind him and I don' t know why
I know that sounds crazy
No it doesn' t
Goldie worked the Clergy
Just like that, a whopper of a puzzle piece falls smack in my lap
I' m too dumb to put the whole picture together yet, but... she fires up 2 cigarettes and hands me one and i taste her lipstick on it and suddenly my heart' s pounding so loud I can' t hear anything else
I wanna reach over and touch her and taste Goldie' s sweat 1 more time but she isn' t Goldie
Yeah, yeah, this' il do
This rubber tubing
And a spool of razor wire
A pair of those special gloves that' il... let me handle the wire
Beefing up the old home security, huh?
You bet your ass
So I' m in this one to the end
But why are you willing to go up against Roark for someone you barely know
She was nice to me.
Gave me something I didn' t even know existed
I wasn' t never even able to... buy a woman.
Yeah, the way I look
I take my mind off her and I crawl back inside myself
It' s almost killing time, and I better get sharp
Rubber tubing
Gas
Saw
Gloves
Cuffs
Razor wire
Hatchet
Gladys
And my mits
We' re close enough.
Yes, Marv
Keep the engine running
If I' m not back in 20 minutes, you get the hell out of here.
Don' t look back
Kill him for me, Marv
Kill him good
I won' t let you down
Heading downstairs to the kitchen.
Getting himself a midnight snack
And I can guess what kind
Come on, you son of a bitch
Damn, he' s slick
Is that the best you can do, creep?
That' s right.
I can take it
Let' s see you hop around now
I try to slow my heart down and breath the fire out of my lungs
Let me do it, Marv
She was my sister, let me finish him
Oh, but I wanted to ki...
I' m sorry kid, but I haven' t even started with this creep and I don' t want you watching the rest it' il give you nightmares
God, I got to tell you, I' m good and bushed
It' s not that fight of our that did me in either
It' s all that sawing and tying
It' s not as easy as it looks
It could' ve been a real mess around here if I didn' t have that tubing for... turniquettes
I got to admit... there was a spurt or 2
You get the scent in the air.
To get that friend of yours to come running
Well, what do you know.
Look who' s here
Here he comes
That' s a good dog
He doesn' t scream.
Not even when the mutt' s had its fill and Kevin' s guts are lying all over the place but somehow the bastard is still alive, still staring at me
Not even when I grab the saw and finish the job
He never screams
I put in a call to Katie' s and ask Nancy to get her clothes on and meet me at her place
Hey, Nancy.
You got any beers?
Sure, Marv.
Who' s the babe?
There isn' t much of anything Nancy wouldn' t do for me not since a year back when her frat boy roughed her up and I straightened him out but good it really gets my goat when guys rough up dames
So what do you want me to do with her?
What about you?
Are you leaving town?
Hell no.
I like it here
I hotwire a parked cab and stay under the speed limit so as not to get any attention
My head starts to clear, and things start to make sense
I owe you, Goldie.
I owe you 1, and I' m going to pay up
So going after Roark means dying, win, or lose?
Hell, I' il die laughing if I know I' ve done this one thing right
Quiet as a grave out here.
Alright, keep a lookout
What' s left of him, anyways
The dog ate the rest
Oh, my God
You monster
You... demon
Don' t scream of I' il plug you
He had the voice... of an angel
Yet he spoke only to me
And he' s dead now because of 1 stupid whore
It' s not a real good idea for you to talk about Goldie that way... while I' m around
When he came to me
He was a tormented boy
Tormented by guilt
I tried to council him
But the eating.
It filled him with white light tearful, he swore to me that he felt the touch of God almighty
What the hell do you know?
I know it' s pretty damn weird to eat people
He didn' t just eat their bodies.
He ate their souls
And I joined in
They were all whores
Nobody' d miss them
And then your...
Goldie almost ruined everything
She stayed in public places.
And then with you...
You were so convenient.
You' d broken man' s jaw that very night
Who would believe a thug like you?
Kevin killed her
But you wouldn' t be caught
You wouldn' t stop.
Eliminate me
Will that give you satisfaction, my son?
Killing a helpless, old fart
The killing, no.
No satisfaction
Everything up until the killing... will be a gas
Kevin.
We' re going home
You could scream now if you want to
It' s beautiful, Goldie.
It' s just like I promised, only better
And when his eyes go dead, the Hell I send him to must seem like Heaven after what I' ve done to him
Oh my God
They should' ve shot me in the head, and enough times to make sure
It' s so stupid.
Everybody knows what' s coming but they go through the motions anyway, what a waste of time
Month' s fall off the calandar while I breath and eat through tubes
Night after night I wait for someone to come and finish me off
After awhile I realize it' s not going to be so easy as that
I' m on my feet for about 10 minutes before the cops kick them out from under me
They don' t ask me any questions
They just keep knocking the crap out of me and waving a confession in my face and I keep spitting blood all over it and laughing at how many fresh copies they come up with then along comes this worm assitant district attorney who turns the recorder off and says if I don' t sign their confession, they' il kill my mom
I break his arm in 3 places and I sign it
From then on, it' s the circus everybody wants it to be
They nail me for the works.
Not just the people I did kill but even Lucille and the girls that Roark and Kevin ate and even Goldie the judge is all fire and brimstone when she hands down the sentence midnight and my death are only a few hours away, when I get my first surprise in 18 months
My only visitor
I' m ready for anything but that scent
I got him for you good, didn' t I, Goldie
I' m sorry, Wendy.
I got confused again seeing you like this
You can call me Goldie
She smells like angels ought to smell
The goddess
Goldie.
She says her name is Goldie
They even throw in a brew.
It' s the first I' ve had since back at Nancy' s
And get to it
And it' s about damn time, if you ask me
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Would you get a move on, I haven' t got all night
Hit it
That the best you can do, you pansies?
THE BlG FAT KlLL
You can bang on that door all night if you want to.
There is no way in Hell I' m letting you in
I can' t believe you' re doing this to me, Shellie
Everything we' ve shared.
It meant plenty.
Plenty of lost pay on account on how nobody wants to flirt with a waitress whose face is all purple and swollen up with bruises
I know you' re angry, baby.
And I forgive you for that without you even asking me to
That hurts, Shellie.
It' s one thing for you to play hard to get but don' t go trying to cut my nuts off
I... am impossible to get.
Do yourself a favor, Jackie Boy, and get help
Just open the door
Go ahead and open the door, Shellie.
Just open the door.
You' il see how wrong you' ve been about me
I' m ready for him
No.
If he knew that you were here with me, you don' t know how bad this can get
This clown' s got a big mean drunk on
And he' s got 4 friends out there in the hall, breathing had and just as drunk as he is
Somebody?!
Jackie Boy, it' s a regular African lovefest in here
- Let me know who races (???)
You feel like taking them on?
You are teasing me, baby.
I could kick this damn door to splinters
You know what I can do.
You know what I can do
- Alright, Jack - 1...
- Alright - 2...
Alright, alright
Troops, make yourself at home
You brought your whole pack with you?
You' re going to love this baby.
You' re going to call up some of your friends who work in the salloon.
With you and the bunch of us, we' re going to hit every joint in town.
It' s just going to be great
I ain' t calling up nobody
That' s a man' s shirt, and I sure as Hell it ain' t one of mine
You got somebody' s slow stink all over you
You' ve been with another man.
He' s Superman.
He flew out the window just as soon as he heard you were coming because you scared him so bad
You think I have no feelings at all
If you' re going to slug me, just go ahead and get it over with, you sick bastard
There you go, lying about me again, right in front of my friends
I have never hit a woman in my life
You goddamn bastard.
Baby, we' re all here to have a good time
Got to take a leak
Then you could' ve met my boyfriend.
There you go.
After my nuts again
I' m a generous guy
He is generous.
With temper of his, you never should' ve picked on him like you did
You don' t have to.
You don' t have to worry about it
I' ve been told
I don' t hear you making those calls
Oh, I don' t need this grief
Hi, I' m Shellie' s new boyfriend and I' m out of my mind
You ever so much as talk to Shellie again, you even think her name, and I' il cut you in ways that' il make you useless to a woman
A big mistake
Yeah?
You already made a big mistake, yourself
You didn' t flush
Get out of here.
No questions, damnit, no questions.
Dwight, what in the Devil did you do to him?
I just gave him a taste of his own medicine
How' s your jaw?
I' ve been slapped around worse
Dwight?
He was from awhile back before you showed up again with that new face of yours and... it was only because I felt sorry for him.
It was only once
I' ve done some dumb things
But this guy.
He' s a menace.
He might kill somebody if I don' t stop him
No, don' t go!
Shellie shouts something I can' t quite make out over the racket of a passing police copter
But I can' t be sure
It' s a chance I shouldn' t be taking.
But I can' t just go home and forget about it and let Jackie Boy and his pals have their fun
A woman' s blood
Damnit, Dwight, damnit.
You damn fool
I cut Caddy across the car to pick up Jackie Boy heading like a bat out of hell up the hill
I' m speeding
That' s a good way to get yourself noticed and if you' re a murderer with a new face whose 1 fingerprint check away to the fast track to the gas chamber, like I am... the last thing you want is to get noticed
Do I try to talk my way out of this?
Or do I take this cop down and risk it all?
Watch it Jack!
They' re right on our ass
Not for long
Not where we' re headed
My gut tightens up
Jackie Boy' s leading us straight to Old Town
He knows he' s not the law.
Not in Old Town
The ladies are the law here
Beautiful and merciless
If you got the cash and play by the rules, they' il make all your dreams come true
But if you cross them, you' re a corpse
We' il get you there
Aww, sweetheart.
I work the dayshift, and it' s been a long day.
Get in the car, baby.
We' il just talk.
It' il be nice
I don' t do talk jobs, either
Baby doll, I' ve had me 1 hell of a bad day
I' ve been beat up every time I turn around
Well?
There' s only so much a man can take
That' s the Alamo, not the Amigo
The Amigo' s a fag joint
Are you having a good time?
Humiliating me like this for no damn reason at all?
That' s far enough, Dwight
We' ve been on top of these peckerwoods since they first showed up with that cop behind them
Everything' s under control.
Enjoy the show
There' s no use arguing with her
So how' s the barmaid?
You know, the one that never shuts up
Not right now, Gail
Oooh, wound up a little tight, aren' t we?
You worry too much
That and your lousy taste in women
These days, anyway
Damnit, Gail.
Not right now
Those clowns, down the way.
They some of the barmaids' boyfriends?
1 of them thinks he is.
He' s out of control
I followed them here to make sure he didn' t hurt any of the girls
Us helpless, little girls
All kinds of death is about to hit less than 20 yards ahead of us
And still it' s hard to take my eyes off her
Us girls are as safe as can be, Lancelot
Those boys in that Chrystler are 1 mistake away from seeing what Miho can do
And she' s been aching for some practice
She guards my glance upward to the pixie perched on the roofs edge
You' re running out of valley, cowboy
Turn around.
Safe yourself and your buddies a ton of grief
You' re a sassy little thing
You ain' t hardly in any kind of position to be making threats
Locked and ready to spring
They' re scum.
They deserve what' s coming
So why this rotten feeling in my gut that something is awfully wrong?
They haven' t killed anybody I don' t know about
And they won' t
Why this rotten feeling?
Something Shellie said
I can' t place it
I' m a little edge
Over the edge
It' s not a woman you need, it' s a good night sleep
You couldn' t handle a woman in the state you' re in
She saying you don' t got what it takes, Jack
You want to see it?
Huh?
I' ve seen all shapes, all sizes
Have you seen this one?
Oh, sugar.
You just gone and done the dumbest thing in your whole life
I don' t know where... for no reason at all
He' s got the drop on her
He' s got squat
He' s dead, he' s just too dumb to know it
I got you... right where I want you
There' s going to be hell to pay
Watch your step, Jackie Boy
Everyone in here is going to (???)
Hang it up, she' s just playing with you
You' re only making it worse
Don' t pull the trigger, she blocked the barrell.
I told you to shut up
Can' t see
I can' t see
I can' t hear anything
For God sake, Miho, finish him
Make it quick, will you
She doesn' t quite chop his head off
She makes a Pez Dispenser out of him
Then it' s straight to business stretching the corpses on the alley floor and checking their pockets digging up cash when they find it
I' m fishing around in Jackie Boy' s pants.
Master Card, Discover, Platinum American Express
And nearly 300 bucks worth of 20s that I' m not too proud to stuff into my own pockets
Then I find an atom bomb
Jackie Boy.
You son of a bitch
There was a helicopter that kicked up such a racket I couldn' t quite make out what she said
I thought Shellie said "Stop"
She said "Cop"
Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty
"Iron Jack", the papers call him
A goddamn hero cop
It' s hell for years, the shaky truce
The cops get a slice of the profits and free entertainment when they throw a party
The girls get to administer their own brand of justice
They get to defend their own turf
If a cop blunders into the neighborhood and he' s not shopping for what the girls are selling
But they send him back alive
That' s the rules
That' s the truce
The cops stay out
That keeps the girls free to keep the pimps and the mob out
Old Town will be left wide open
It' il be war
The streets will run red with blood women' s blood
The cops
Things are going to go back to the way they used to be
The hell they will
We got guns
We' il fight the cops and the and mob and anybody else who tries to move in on us
We' il go to war
Don' t be stupid, Gail.
You wouldn' t stand a chance
Make sure it' s a hard top with a decent engine
I' il hide the bodies
Did you forget that cop car that trailed them here?
The cops know Rafferty came here
They' il check the river, they' il check the sewer
They' il find him and come gunning for us
I' il hall the bodies to the pits.
Get that gun out of my face or I' il smack you
Who do you think you are, giving orders?
- You got what you wanted out of us - Shut up, Gail
You got what you wanted out of me
And you were gone, off playing with that barmaid.
Gone until you brought this unholy mess on us
Miho moves to my back
1 word from Gail and she' il cut me in half
They' il be watching the roads
It' il be the bad old days, all over again
The pimps, the beatings, the drugs, the raps
They won' t be watching the roads, not yet, they won' t.
If I don' t make it, you can have your war
Get that gun out of my face, now
Bastard!
I forgot how quick you are
My warrior woman
She almost yanks my head clean off
Shoving my mouth into hers, it hurts
An explosion that blasts away the dull gray years between the now and that 1 firey night when she was mine
A hard top, with a decent engine, and make sure it' s got a big trunk
I' il always love you, baby
Always
And never
Where' d you find that heap?
Just look at that trunk
- We' il never fit them all in - Gail?
Unless there' s something else you want me to do, do you think maybe I could go home?
All this blood and stuff' s got me feeling like maybe I got to hurl
Sure, Becky, go home.
But don' t you talk to anybody
They' il never fit in that trunk
Not like this, they won' t
Dry your hair as soon as you get home
You' il catch cold if you don' t
Yeesh
Hey, Becky.
Gail said no calls
I just want to hear my mom' s voice.
Please, don' t say nothing to Gail
Hey, mama?
Dizzy dames
We were barely able to get the trunk to stay closed as it was, we packed it so tight
There wasn' t anything we could do but pile Jackie Boy in right next to me
Now where anybody who cares to look will see him
Take 1 of his cigarettes
It' il help
It' s got you smoking there, bud
You shut the hell up, Jackie Boy
You' re dead
I' m just imagining this, so shut the hell up
That tells you something about your state of mind, don' t it
It' s got you hearing things.
It' s got your nerves shot
It' s got you smoking
You know it' s true...
Nobody ever really quits
A smoker' s a smoker when the chips are down
- And your chips are down... much - I' m fine, you shut the hell up
Will you look at that
Those hookers let you down
What are you going to do when you run out of gas?
You sucker for the babes
You ain' t even going to make it to the pits
You shut the hell up.
Not unless you keep your eyes on the road, sugar pie
Ah, this is great.
Just like being in a body movie
Shut up!
Oh, you' re screwed
It' s over.
You' re flushed
This time I can' t bring myself to tell him to shut up
Sure he' s an asshole.
Sure that I' m just imagining that he' s talking
None of that stops the bastard from being absolutely right
I don' t have a chance in hell of outrunning this cop
Not in this heap
Pull over!
The only question left is whether I' m going to kill him or not
Tough call
For all I know, he' s an honest cop, regular guy working stiff with a mortgage, a wife, and a pile of kids
My hand moves on its own, sliding 1 of my guns to my lap and thumbing back the hammer
I don' t know what to do
You better stop.
You' re making him mad
Whatever you say
You' re friend here.
Party a little too hard tonight?
I' m the designated driver
Well, you' re driving with a busted tail light
I' il let you off with a warning
What next?
The tank goes dry a quarter mile from the pits
I shove the T- Bird the rest of the way
A few minutes more work and it' il all be over
Jackie Boy will go into the damn tar pits
I' il catch a train out of Sacred Oaks
Go home and call it a...
No more questions, Dallas.
Do what I say.
Clear the streets
We' re not selling any tail in Old Town
Not tonight
Don' t struggle.
You' il only hurt yourself
Your cause is lost
We know everything
Soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty will be in our possession
And the truce between your prostitutes and the police will be shattered
There' il be arrests.
My employer will sieze what remains of this neighborhood
You will all be slaves.
Nothing can stop this
But it is within your power to save many lives by facilitating the process of transition by negotiating the terms of the surrender of Old Town
Son of a bitch.
I have suffered your kind before
The dregs of Sin City.
I serve a new master now
And soon, you and all your retched kind will serve him as well
Now get dressed and shed a tear for Dwight McCarthy if you must because by now, he is surely dead
My man will find a way
He always finds a way
I find these Americans always whine and going on about how they got it so bad
This is a fine, grand country.
Guiding light of the modern world, it is
Low taxes, land of of opportunity
Where else would 1 bullet boy' s defortune that we' re getting for this (???)
Sure beats a living hell out of blowing off airports and churches without shit to show for it
Yeesh
You find something, Murphy?
Look to be our poor dead cop' s badge
It' s all bent up
Bent and stock in it
Oh, bloody he...
You son of a bitch!
They weren' t cops, these 4
They were mercenaries
And if they were hired by who I think they were, the bad times haven' t even started yet
And everything seemed to be going so well
Remember, we don' t have to deliver every last inch of the man, Brian
You got a good point there, Ronnie
Hand me a knife
Should take a nap while I' m doing all this waiting
I' m at the bone, alright?
Here we go
Have you ever seen anything so pretty in your whole life?
We' re a back to 3 of you.
And if anyone happens by, use your imagination.
Silence now
No air to breath
Only the horrid oily tar taste creeping up my nostrils
Let it in.
Let it fill your lungs
They were counting on you, and you blew it
Skinny, stealy fingers at my wrist
Miho, you' re an angel.
You' re a saint
You' re Mother Theresa.
You' re a god
And if you' ve shown up 10 minutes earlier, we' d still have Jackie Boy' s head
Dwight, they got Gail
It' s a sinch.
You got yourself a spy in Old Town
A stooly who sold you out to the mob
We got to find out who it is and rescue Gail
Miho.
I hope to hell you left 1 of them alive enough to talk
I let him know I' m not fooling around
We talk
Stay smart, stay cool
It' s time to prove to your friends that you' re worth a damn
Sometimes that means dying
Sometimes it means killing a whole lot of people
There they are.
We stop them, Dallas
Jackie Boy' s head so close to me, I could almost reach out and grab it right then and there
Get the head, get the head
I got it, I got it
Suck on this, you stupid slag
I can' t tell if Miho is alive or dead but I' m on my feet and every ounce of me wants to get some killing done
Want the head now, sweetheart.
So come down and get it!
Brave lad
I could' ve put a bullet straight down your ear just now if I haven' t gotten my revolver all wet and useless you got the drop on my, love
I' m as helpless as a baby
Better come clean with you, sweetheart
It was an old trade lie I was giving you about my revolver being wet
You see, I' m not too fond of shooting
It' s my preference to blow things off
I should blast the roof off a pulp
I' ve seen all the parts flying off people
Little bang- bang' s never going to match the size of that
And here' s me with all these fine grenades, such a sweet beauty of a remote
But it' s my knife I' il be doing you with
You killed my mates
Someone should' ve told you
Never give an Irishman a good cause for revenge
Deadly little Miho
You won' t feel a thing unless she wants you to
She twists the blade
He feels it
I tell Miho what we' re going to do and how we' re going to do it
I grab poor Dallas' s car phone and make the most important call of my life
First we got to rescue Gail
Then comes the kill
The big fat kill
You just going to stand there and watch this?
You kidding me man?
Like watching old Manute do his thing all night long, and not get tired of it.
Only an artist should be allowed to touch such a beautiful subject
Your skin is perfect
Your nerves... responsive
Beautiful
Just give them what they want, Gail
Becky?
It' s over, Gail.
There' s no fighting them
Dwight' s dead.
They got' s what' s left of that cop we killed
The mob' s going to turn it over to the police chief, the cops are going to mow us down.
You little bitch.
You sold us out
I didn' t have no choice
They was going to hurt my mom
It selfish, you holding out like this.
You' re going to get a lot of girls killed for no good reason
It wasn' t your mom.
We could' ve protected her, and you know it
It was the money, you stupid little bitch
Sure you could' ve moved my mom into Old Town and let her know that her own goddamn daughter is a whore
- Break' s your heart - Doesn' t it
They offered me what you couldn' t never offer me
I had to watch out for my own neck
You' re neck.
You' re precious, scrawny, little neck
You' re crazy.
You could' ve ripped my throat out, you crazy whore
Schutz, fetch my blades
Stuka, kill this one
No, I was promised
Stupid little bitch.
I knew there was a reason I got out of bed this morning
Hey... hey
Nobody, I don' t see nobody
Could we look at that?
It' s right through me.
There' s somethign wrapped around it
Some kind of note
Give it to me
The fuck we' re doing?
Out back, everyone, and bring the women
You think, somebody should call me a doctor or something?
McCarthy, you fool
Hey.
Guys?
Ohh
Dozens of them
Armed to the teeth
I' m outnumbered, outgunned
But the alley is crooked, dark, and very narrow
They can' t surround me
Sometimes you can beat the odds with a careful choice of where to fight
You can have Old Town.
I don' t care.
Just give me the woman
Shut up
Dwight.
Don' t do this
Hey, wait a minute.
Shut up.
Or I' il plug you
Of course, Mr. McCarthy.
A fair trade.
She' s all yours
Now if you' il explain why we shouldn' t blow both of you to pieces
Dwight, what have you done?
Exactly what I had to... every step of the way
No, it isn' t right.
There wasn' t no tape over his mouth.
How come there' s tape over his mouth
Where the fight counts for a lot
You trick, McCarthy, but it will do you no good
But there' s nothing like having your friends show up with lots of guns
No, McCarthy, you shan' t!
The girls all know the score
No escape
No surrender
No mercy
We got to kill every last rat bastard one of them
Every last one
Not for revenge.
Not because they deserve it. not because it' il make the world a better place
We need a heap of bloody bodies so when mob boss, Wallenquist, looks over his charts of profits and losses, he' il see what it cost him to mess with the girls of Old Town
The valkyrie at my side is shouting and laughing with the pure hate for blood- thirsty joy of the slaughter
And so am I
The fire, baby.
It' il burn us both
There' s no place in this world for our kind of fire
My warrior woman.
My valkyrie
You' il always be mine.
Always.
And never
THAT YELLOW BASTARD
Evening officer
I don' t... have to introduce myself, do I?
You read the papers?
This being an election year, you' ve seen plenty of my picture
You know who I am and what I can do
I' m doing you, Hartigan
Cold and hard, I' m doing you
You blew my son' s ear off
Blew his arm off, you even blew his nuts and his pecker off
He' s in a coma right now, they say he may never come out of it
My boy.
He could' ve been the first Rourk to become the president of the United States, but you had turned him into a brain damaged dickless freak
Pulling that trigger make you feel powerful?
Power don' t come from a badge, or a gun
Power comes from lying
Lying big and getting the whole damn world to play along with you
Once you got everybody agreeing with what they know in their hearts ain' t true, you get them by the balls
There' s what, maybe 500 people in this hospital
I could pump you full of bullets right now and I wouldn' t be arrested
Everyone would lie for me, everyone who counts
Otherwise all their own lies, everything that runs Sin City, it all comes tumbling down like a pack of cards
But I want you firm, fit, and healthy
I' m even putting up cash of my own to get you more surgery.
Fix that... heart condition of yours
You' re going to keep living a long time, I' m going to make sure of that
You' re going to be convicted of raping that little brat
And shooting my boy
Your wife.
You tell her the truth, and she' s dead
You tell anybody the truth, and they' re dead
They won' t let testify
They talked my parents into keeping me away
They said that you done things that you didn' t do
I told them that you saved me from that Rourk creep
But they won' t even check me out to see if I' m still a virgin
Still a virgin, still alive
Thanks to you
They got it all backwards
Sometimes the truth doesn' t matter like it ought
But you' il always remember things, right?
That' s going to mean a lot to me
Stay away, Nancy
They' il kill you if you don' t stay away
Don' t visit me, don' t write me, don' t even say my name
If you won' t let me visit, but I' il still write to you, Hartigan
I' il sign my letters "Cordelia"
It' s a name of a really cool detective in books I read
I' il write to you every week
For forever
Sure kid
Now run on home
It' s not safe for you hear
Bye, Nancy
I love you
John Hartigan
Mr. "Law and Order"
Mr. "By- The- Book"
Mr. High and Mighty
I got to give you credit.
Being such a straight arrow for so damn many years without it catching up with you
It' s catching up with you now, friend of mine
It' s catching up with you but good
Maybe I had a look at him.
He doesn' t look too good
He' s hailing hard, Tammy.
He' s a picture of hell
She' s fine, isn' t she?
I rented her out of Old Town
I want to show you what you won' t be getting of
Not in prison
You hear me, Hartigan?
You stop being stupid
Start playing along with us, you just might get some of Tammy
You see that?
She flinched
You make her sick
She heard about you and that little girl
This is nothing but a price I promised myself I' d pay, and I' m paying it
You don' t save a little girl' s life, and turn around and throw her to the dogs
Not in my book, you don' t
They want a confession.
They won' t get i
There' s a letter from Nancy when they put me in solitary
She calls herself "Cordelia"
She makes no mention of anything that would give her away
But every thursday, another 1 arrives
What a sweet kid
I do my best to keep my hand from shaking when I reach for it
She' s the only friend I got
The daughter I never had
My sweet Cordelia
Skinny little Nancy Callahan
8 years pass
Then comes a Thursday when I bound from my cot, excited as a kid at Christmas
Only to find myself staring at the damn floor of my damn cell
Looking for a letter from Nancy that isn' t there
Then another Thursday with no letter
Is she alright?
Did something happen to her?
Nothing
2 months now.
Not a word from Nancy
Did they find her?
Did they get to her?
Of course.
Stupid old man
Do your math.
Nancy' s 19 years old.
How long did you expect her to keep writing?
She was a saint to give it up as long as she did
She' s forgotten you, old man
You' re alone.
You' re all alone
This guy smells awful, like bad food
Like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster in the middle of summer
He stinks so bad, I want to throw up
Practically knocked my head off, the bastard
When I come to, I see it
The same kind of envelope Nancy always uses
But there' s no letter inside of it
Something soft.
Something that ought to be alive
A hunk of meat and bone that ought to be the index finger of the right hand of a 19 year old girl
How the hell did they find her?
She was so careful.
She never gave away where she lives or where she works
I' ve got to get out.
I' ve got to help.
Nothing else matters
Not my life, and not my pride either
It' s only 1 final surrender they want
You got me Rourk, you beat me
I say everything they want to hear, just the way they want to hear it
I tell them I' m a twisted, retched child molester
I agree to everything they want from me
I love you, Nancy
It' s a lot of miles into town, Hartigan
You care for a ride?
As long as you stay in front of me
Prison' s made you paranoid
Talk about water under the bridge.
8 years
Yeah, 8 years
Well, if it' s any consolation for you...
You made me hate myself
Any word from Aileen?
Yeah.
She got remarried... 4 years ago
She had 2 kids
I' m sorry, John
Don' t be
I' m glad
Aileen always wanted kids
She' il make a good mother
Like you said, Bob.
"Water under the bridge"
Bob and I get along with our fond farewells to eachother
And I go looking for the only human being on the planet that means a damn to me
Nancy
How could they have found out it was you writing all those letters to me
How did they find out who you are?
And what have they dont to you, baby?
Not a sound
No sign of life
Has Rourk gone through all this trouble to torture an old man?
Like a kid poking at fly when he' s already torn its wings off?
What has he done to Nancy?
It' s like all she does is read and study and write
No diary.
No phone numbers or addresses written down anywhere
Closest thing to a clue is a pack of matches from a louzy salloon
It' s a long shot, but maybe she' s got some friends there
A dead end
Nancy wouldn' t have anything to do with a pack of drunks and losers like this
But if there' s anything to be found here, the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is or whoever kidnapped her or mutilated her this is the place
Excuse me, miss.
I' m wondering if you could help me
I' m looking for somebody
Well, a night like this, everybody' s looking for somebody, stranger
It' s not like that.
Her name is Nancy
Eyes to the stage, pilgrim
She' s just warming up
Skinny little Nancy Callahan
She grew up
She filled out
Nancy Callahan, 19 year old
And here I was expecting a skinny little bookworm maybe a bit too shy for her own good how little she told me about herself in all her letters for all those years
How the hell did they find her?
Then it hits me
They were bluffing
I' ve led them straight to her
She hasn' t spotted you yet
Turn around and walk out the door
Lead the creep outside
Get that berretta away from him somehow, and kill him
I' m just a horny ex- con watching an exotic dancer
Just a few seconds and she' il be safe
No, Nancy.
Don' t notice me
Don' t recognize me
There' s no time to explain.
I' ve made a terrible mistake
I put you in terrible danger.
Right this second
Whatever you say, Hartigan.
Let me throw some clothes on
And here I' d figured you' d forget all abotu me.
Me and my dumb letters
Kept me going
Kept me from killing myself
Hurry up, will you?
- Maybe I should drive - Not a chance
Nobody but me can keep this heap running
Besides from the sounds of things, you might have to shoot somebody
I don' t have a gun
Under the seat
It' s loaded and it works
This' il do
Taken it to the range a couple times
Kicks like a mule
Hartigan?
There' s so much I' ve wanted to say to you.
You never go far from my thoughts
I' ve lain awake nights, thinking of you
What are you talking about?
Keep driving and keep the car on the road
She' s counting on you, old man
What are you doing?
Prove you' re still worth a damn
Try to keep it on the road, Nancy
He' s a decent shot
But he' s in too much of a hurry
Throwing away bullets like they were candy
He doesn' t know how to take his time
Aim carefull and look the devil in the eye
Stop the car, Nancy.
I' ve got to confirm the kill
- What?
- Stop the car, now!
Right.
Stop the car.
Confirm the kill
Sorry, I got a little rattled
It' s OK.
You did great.
Sit tight.
I' il be right back
Let me stay close
Nothing can happen to me when I' m with you
Please?
Let me stay close?
The stink.
I almost gag
His blood smells even worse than he does
And it' s all over the place
But the creep, himself... he' s gone
We' re out of time
Sirens.
I used to welcome the sound
There' s nothing to do now but find a place to huddle up for the night
Get Nancy to calm down and figure out what on Earth I' m going to do next
The stink.
Somehow it stays with us all the way to the hotel
Nancy, I went to your apartment.
Your windows thrown wide open
The rooms looks almost empty.
That' s why I' m sure you' d been kidnapped
My window?
Robbed again?
That' s the 3rd time this year
I swore if I ever saw you again, I' d show you I grew up strong
There I was just like before, scared and helpless
- I' m such an asshole - You should sit down.
You' il feel a little bit better if you sit down
I' ve never been all that good with people
When it comes to reassuring a traumatized 19 year old...
I' m as expert as a Paulsy victim doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench
It' s always been you, Hartigan
All these years
It' s just nerves making you say that
I need to sleep
- Sleep with me - Stop it, Nancy
8 years.
Why do you think I kept writing you those letters
It wasn' t just gratitude
I tried to fall in love with boys
I thought I did once or twice
But I was already in love... with you
That' s enough.
Jesus Christ.
I' m old enough to be your grandfather
- You' re just scared - I' m not scared
No
There' s wrong and there' s wrong and then there' s this
For God' s sakes, you' re just a kid
I love you
I love you, too with all my heart
Cold shower.
It helps
No, Nancy
Recognize my voice, Hartigan?
Recognize my voice, you piece of shit cop?
I look different, but I bet you can recognize my voice
Sure, I recognize your voice, Junior
Everything' s going straight to hell
I' ve been suckered into betraying the only friend I got
And put her in the hands of a murdering rapist I thought I put down for good
Suckered by a spoiled brat, son of a senator
It' s all gone to hell
Klump.
It' s me
I got a dead man needs to be fetched
I want you to set me up for a party
I' ve already got the girl, you dumb shit
It better be perfect or I' m calling my dad
My tools better be clean and sharp
Better be ready.
It better be perfect
I get to do whatever I want
However I want, whenever I want it
My dad.
I' d love him if I didn' t hate him
He spent a fortune hiring every expert on the planet to grow back that equipment you blew off from between my legs
Just so the old fart can hold out some kind of hope of having a grandkid
Although, as you can see, there were some... side effects
I' m not complaining though.
Since you' ve been gone, I' ve been having the time of my life
Now you' ve led me back to your darling Cordelia
We all wondered who wrote all those letters.
She left not a clue
Clever girl.
So pretty, so pretty
Little old for my taste, but I can forgive that just this once
Nancy, don' t scream.
Whatever he does to you, don' t scream
She' il scream.
I' m going to take all night doing dear old Nancy.
And you' re going to die knowing it' s all your fault
They' ve all screamed, Hartigan
Dozens of them.
Maybe a hundred 8 years worth.
Every one of them screamed
And if there weren' t so many people hear about, I would show you how to make dear old Nancy scream
It' s going to be 1 hell of a show
This is it.
No way to fight it now
No hope left
No chance
This is it
This is the end
No
Give it a shot, old man.
Keep your neck tight
Move.
The window.
Maybe there' s an alarm
The window.
Keep your neck tight, God dammit.
Stay conscious
Stay conscious
No alarm
The glass.
Cut the rope.
You can do it
You can do it
It is inclement upon me to comment with mark displeasure on your rash impulsiveness in selecting such an eye- catching and impracticle car to heist, Mr. Shlubb
Irrelevent to said mission, is the following queary which I now put forth to you
Where in this most streamlined and trunkless of transports, boner inspiring though it may be, where in, are we to reposit our recently deceased cargo?
I can only express puzzlement that borders on alarm
Show me where Roark takes the girls, or I' il cut your damn head off
In plain english, creep
He had to (???)
Even agrarian (???)...
The Farm
That' s all I need to hear
Every cop on the force knows about the Roark Family' s farm and to stay away from it
Shlubb and Klump were packing an arsenal
Once things get loud, I' il probably have use for the cannons
But at first, I' il have to play it quiet
Quiet and nasty
Nancy' s car.
6 miles from the Farm
"Nobody but me can keep this heap running" she told me
Good girl
The car stalled out on that yellow bastard you kept your mouth shut.
I' il bet Junior was serious
I bet he slapped you around something fierce
But you stayed strong.
You bought a few extra minutes
There' s still a chance, Nancy
Don' t scream
I ditch the car a mile or so from the Farm and make my way through the woods
I' m not half way there when it hits
My heart
I was cured
Bad cough
Blood in it.
Doesn' t matter now
I don' t have to stay alive that much longer anyway
Rotten way to kill a man
But it' s quiet
Hate yourself later
You' re only making it worse for yourself, you stupid cow!
Don' t you think I' m tired?
Is that it?
You think I' m getting tired?
You' re the one who' s going to crack.
You' il crack!
You' il cry and beg
You' il scream
Oh yeah, you' il scream, you big fat ugly cow.
You' il scream
You thinking the whip is the best I could do?
That was foreplay
Hartigan was right about you.
You can' t get it up unless I scream
You' re pathetic pathetic
That' s not wise at all to make fun of me like that
It brings out the worst in me
Stupid old man
In too much of a hurry
Damn.
It can' t be!
Charging in like Gallahad, just like I told myself I wouldn' t
Stupid old man
- Attacked him good - Don' t take no chances.
Perferate the fool
Good advice
Give it up, Junior
It' s over.
Let her go
You' re dreaming Hartigan
I get to see your eyes while I fillet the woman of your dreams right in front of you
Look at you.
You' re about to keel over, you can' t even lift that cannon
Sure I can
You gave me the scare there for a second, old man
Nancy, I' m sorry
I' m taking no chances with you
First I soften you up, and then it' s showtime
Here it comes
It' s going to hurt
You' re right about that
Sucker
I take away his weapon
Both of them
After awhile, all I' m doing is pounding wet chunks of bone into the floor boards
So I stop
So long, Junior
Been a pleasure
I didn' t scream, Hartigan
Not once
I didn' t scream
I know it, baby
You grew up strong
By the time I get her to the car, Nancy stops shaking
Her skin is warm again
She' s herself again
Thanks for remembering my coat
And for all the little things
Like saving my life... twice
You better get rolling
You' re not coming along?
No.
I have friends on their way
To collect evidence.
I' m going to blow this whole sick mess wide open
I' m going to clear my name.
I' m going to put Senator Roark behind bars, where he belongs
Can' t lose you.
Not again
You' il never lose me, Nancy
Nancy Callahan.
The love of my life
Shame to lie to her.
I hope she forgives me for it
Sure.
And maybe after I' ve pulled off that miracle, I' il go and punch out God
There isn' t a prosecutor in the state who' il go after Senator Roark
I killed his only son.
The bloodline is cut
Roark' s lost his goddamn legacy
He' il use all his power to get revenge on me
He' il go after me through Nancy
He' il find her again.
There' il be no end to it
She' il never be safe.
Not as long as I' m alive
There' s only one way to beat him
And old man dies.
A young woman lives
Fair trade
I love you, Nancy
Uh- huh... yes
Oh mom.
Don' t go on like that
It' s not the city.
I could' ve gotten in a car accident anywhere
Yeah, just a fracture
The doctor said, it' s a clean break.
Should be right as rain in no time
Uh- huh
Turn the right corner in Sin City and you can find... anything
Becky?
Care for a smoke?
I love you too, mom
Anything
"Mr. Speaker, will the 30s go down as the decade...
"which witnessed the destruction...
"and downfall of the British empire?"
"That witnessed the wanton self- destruction..." of the British empire? "
"If India were granted..." self- government...
"it would mark the downfall of the British empire."
"It would mark and consummate..." the downfall of the British empire. "
Mr. Inches, you' re wanted!
On my way.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, madam.
Have to do something about Miss Sarah' s gramophone.
I don' t want to start the day with a family altercation.
- No, madam.
- Hello, Mommy.
Good morning, darling.
Inches, kindly tell my daughter to turn off that bloody gramophone.
Trashy music all over the house.
There you go, sir.
Why does she do it?
Leave it to me, sir, will you?
Have you been drinking?
This time of the morning, sir?
Certainly not.
If you have, I hope it' s your damn whisdey and not mine.
What time is Mrs. P coming?
Early afternoon, sir.
- Early afternoon?
Why not this morning?
- Because you told her to come after lunch.
Pure invention, I did nothing of the sort.
You said you' re going to town this morning... so she would not be required until after lunch.
I' ve changed my mind, I need to redraft the speech.
- Get her here now!
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Churchill?
- Mrs. Landing.
- Good morning, madam.
What' s wrong?
It' s Mr. Monds, madam.
- Butcher?
- Yes, madam.
It seems we haven' t paid his bill for several weeks.
And he says he' d rather not provide us with any more meat until the account' s settled.
Inches!
I' il write a checd and you send one of the girls to deliver it.
Thank you.
Inches, liver salts.
Good morning, sir.
- Morning.
- Randolph, you look dreadful.
- Thank you, Mama.
All those double brandies late last night.
I' m not in the same league as my beloved papa.
It' s very bad of a young man to drink so much...
Don' t start nagging at this time of the morning, please?
Let me wade up first.
Who is it?
Winston, have you paid Mr. Monds?
The butcher from Westerham, have you paid his bills?
My dear Clemmie, I' m trying to save India from Mr. Gandhi... and his gang of subversive Hindus, to save British imperial power... from a disastrous eclipse, and save the Tory Party... from an act of shame and dishonor.
For God' s sake, woman, I can' t do everything!
Good morning, Mrs. P!
Good morning, Mary!
How' s she going?
Fine, thank you.
You look lovely!
He did.
He' s changed his mind.
I wish he didn' t do that.
I have to take the girls to Westerham to buy shoes.
Heaven knows when I' il get another opportunity.
- Mr. Churchill?
- Mrs. P, at last!
Good morning.
We have much to do and very little time in which to do it.
Inches, please tell Mr. Churchill I' ve decided to go to town with him.
- What time will he be leaving?
On the dot.
We' il revise this speech... and go on to the second chapter... on the way up to London.
- Today?
- Anything wrong with that?
No, of course not, Mr. Churchill.
And bring my notes for the Battle of Blenheim.
- Clemmie, did I keep you waiting?
- Not more than usual.
- Good morning, Mrs. Churchill.
- How are you, Mrs. P?
Don' t let him boss you about, he' s a dreadful bully.
Nonsense, Mrs. P adores me.
- Very well.
Volume 2, Chapter 20, the Battle of Blenheim.
We' re already on page 800 and something.
Bugger the publishers, this is more than a biography.
It' s a panegyric... a tribute to my great and illustrious ancestor.
Get a move on, Jenner, overtake!
Of course.
I dreamt about it last night.
I could see everything.
Our eyes met.
I think he smiled at me.
You shouldn' t have had so much cheese.
You shouldn' t have had so much cheese.
Stilton always gives you nightmares.
"Mr. Speaker, the loss of India...
"would mark and consummate the downfall of the British empire.
"If we cannot do our duty in India...
"we shall have shown ourselves unworthy...
"to preserve the vast empire...
"which still centers upon this small island.
"It is alarming...
"and also nauseating to see Mr. Gandhi...
"a seditious Middle Temple lawyer...
"now posing as a fakir of a type well known in the East..." striding half- naded up the steps of the Viceregal Palace...
"to parley on equal terms..." with the representative of the King Emperor. "
Councils, private members' bills, second reading.
What a monstrous speech.
You' re his friend, Bracden.
You should tell him to stop making a fool of himself.
It' s pathetic.
Britain is losing her grip on its imperial affairs.
He' s trying to stop the rot.
Rubbish.
Winston' s a self- serving opportunist.
That' s why nobody trusts him.
No loyalty.
Does his party count for nothing?
Is it disloyal to defend what one believes in passionately?
He' s attacding government policy, so he' s attacding his own party.
It' s about time he toed the line and stopped being such a bloody nuisance.
Wrong hat, Tom.
Mr. Woods, this is appalling.
You must remember that your husband lost a very substantial sum... as a result of the Wall Street crash.
We' re bandrupt.
Not exactly.
But I have made it clear to your husband that economies are necessary.
What did he say?
He promised to cut down to three bottles of champagne in the evening.
There was a time... when people used to rush into the chamber to hear me speak.
"It' s Winston," they' d cry.
"Winston' s on his feet."
Now they hurry away... as if to avoid an embarrassing accident.
I' m finished, Brendan.
Nonsense.
Witnessing my own demise.
Diana.
- At the wedding.
Good to see you again.
I' m so glad to see you.
Hello, Morton, how' s the spying game?
I' m not a spy, I' m a civil servant.
Where' s your father?
I' m afraid he' s having a black- dog day.
We rely on you to get him out of it.
He returned from London in a terrible mood.
He' s been like that ever since.
Winston!
Dogs look up to you.
Cats look down on you.
Pigs treat you as equals.
What is it?
India?
Partly.
- Partly these.
- What about them?
Full of "Herr" Hitler.
Made me think.
At 35, I was Home Secretary... 37, First Lord of the Admiralty... at 50, Chancellor of the Exchequer, doing pretty well.
- Not bad.
- Now look at me.
No power, no prospect of power.
look at Hitler.
From bugger- all to head of state in 10 years.
- Come and have some lunch.
- Not hungry.
- Everyone' s waiting.
- Let them wait.
What have you got there?
- I' il show you indoors.
- Will it cheer me up?
Not exactly.
You may be right about Germany.
What do you mean?
What is all this?
It' s a report from our air attaché in Berlin.
He says the Nazis have in training over 8, 000 pilots.
Sounds as if Hitler... is creating an air force.
I would say so.
God help us, Desmond.
England is lost in a pacifist dream.
People prefer that to the nightmare of war.
Passchendaele and the Somme are all too close for comfort.
It' s time they bloody wode up.
Mr. Baldwin?
Prime Minister.
"Herr" Brecder.
My government is very displeased by a number of scurrilous... and totally unfounded attacds on the Third Reich... that seem to emanate from your ambassador' s office in Berlin.
- Sir Robert?
- Yes.
If it' s true, we shall take immediate action.
I deplore any attempt to create feelings of doubt and suspicion.
Thank you, Mr. Baldwin.
Mr. Wigram.
Perhaps you will let me know the results of these inquiries.
Our most recent dispatch from our ambassador reported... that Nazi policy is intensely anti- Jewish.
Is that "scurrilous and totally unfounded"?
The Jews have become far too prominent in many aspects of German life.
Their influence is disproportionate.
Our policies are merely adjusting the balance.
Is that why you built a concentration camp outside Munich?
It is a place of protective custody, Mr. Wigram.
Remember, it was the British who invented the concentration camp... during the Boer War, I believe.
We are merely following your good example.
Jolly good, what you said in there.
- They get away with it, that' s the trouble.
- Nobody does anything about it.
- It is.
- Desmond Morton.
Foreign Office, Central Department.
I' m terrible at faces.
I' m afraid it' s my training, military intelligence.
I have a filing cabinet instead of a mind.
I' m going to Charing Cross, can I drop you?
Yes, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Deuce.
I think she wants to do it professionally.
- Annoying people?
- No, the stage.
Nonsense.
Girls go on the stage to marry into a good family.
Sarah already belongs to a good family.
Ladies do not become chorus girls.
There' s no cake.
- There isn' t any.
- That' s what I' m telling you, silly girl.
That' s what she means.
Don' t have any cake?
Of course we have cake.
Dundee cake from Fortnum' s.
- Yes, ma' am.
- We have to make economies, Winston.
Four queens.
Why?
He' s my accountant as well.
I wanted to see exactly how bad things are.
- We' ve got the most enormous overdraft.
- We' re paying it off.
- No, we' re not.
For God' s sake, Clemmie, I' m working day and night.
All these articles for "The Evening Standard", Marlborough... not to mention the constituency work.
I know, that' s why we have to economize.
Like depriving me of my Dundee cake.
You' re paying all of Randolph' s debts.
Randolph is hopeless with money, we all know that.
He' s irresponsible.
I' il talk to him.
- It' s your turn.
- What?
- It is, come along.
You just won the last tricd.
Bezique, double bezique.
Score it.
Double bezique, 500 points.
- Winston, I know how to score.
- Do it.
It' s not just Randolph, it' s this house, it' s Chartwell.
That' s where all the money goes.
Surely not.
It' s ruinously expensive.
We shouldn' t have bought it.
Don' t start.
- You went behind my back.
- I did not.
You knew I didn' t like it and you deliberately deceived me.
- That' s not true.
- I never saw such an ugly house.
You may find the house ugly, I do not.
Anyway, that' s beside the point.
- Come with me.
I want to show you something.
- Don' t change the subject.
- I' m not.
Come with me, please.
That' s why I bought it.
What you can see from the house.
England.
look at it, Clemmie.
Nowhere in the world... could you find a landscape more ravishing than that.
And it' s ours... to look at and to cherish for the rest of our lives.
I would die for it, Clemmie.
Winston.
Ralph!
The Cabinet has decided to sell aircraft engines to the Germans.
To be precise, 118 Rolls Royce PV- 12 Merlins.
God almighty.
Designed for civilian use, I am told... but we know they can be used for fighter planes.
This is total madness.
"Trade should have no boundaries," says the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
"If we don' t sell, somebody else will."
What are we doing here, Van?
We made recommendations, write briefing notes, nobody listens.
Nobody in Downing Street gives a damn.
They' re not very interested... in uncomfortable things like political reality.
Surely the Germans aren' t allowed to rearm.
Try telling that to Mr. Hitler.
Why doesn' t the government do something?
They don' t want to provode another war.
Who does?
- And they feel guilty.
- About what?
The Treaty of Versailles, it was far too punitive.
It robbed the Germans of their self- esteem.
- He' s tired.
- Thank you, Ethel.
Shall we go up?
Mr. Baldwin believes a strong Germany... will keep Russia in its place.
The government regards the Communists as a greater threat than the Nazis.
- And are they?
- I think not.
Nazism is more than just a political movement.
It' s a cult... a religion based on the idea of racial purity.
Mankind, the Nazis believe, is divided between... the man- gods and the subhumans... aliens who will be used as beasts of burden... or merely disposed of.
Those with pure Aryan blood are the man- gods.
The beasts are the Jews.
You ready for bed?
Charlie.
Daddy.
Charlie, my boy.
Hello, beautiful boy.
You ready for bed?
Yes, you ready for bed?
Sweet dreams, big man.
Good night, sweetheart.
Good night.
What part of Germany are you from, "Herr" Baron?
- I was there last year with my family.
On holiday?
No, researching for my book on the Duke of Marlborough.
- Having a look at the battlefields.
- How very exciting.
One has to visit the actual places... tread the terrain, as it were.
We nearly had tea with Hitler.
- In Munich?
- At the Ambassador hotel.
The Regina hotel.
The Ambassador' s in Vienna.
Please, don' t interrupt me when I' m trying to interrupt you!
"Herr" Schroder... have you ever seen "Herr" Hitler?
- I' ve met him.
When was this?
I was having dinner with friends.
- What' s he like?
Utterly insignificant.
A gray face, slate gray.
Melancholy jet- black eyes, like raisins.
Melancholy jet- black eyes, like raisins.
A figure out of a ghost story.
He talked on and on, endlessly.
"Out of" Parsifal", "he said...
"I shall make a religion."
His oily hair fell into his face when he ranted.
Then... quite suddenly, he left.
He bowed to me like a waiter... who has just received a fair tip.
When he left... nobody moved... nobody spode.
We all sat in silence.
Rather like this.
"After the Great War, we were told that Germany...
"would be a democracy with parliamentary institutions.
"All this has been swept away.
What do you have?
"Dictatorship, the most grim dictatorship.
"You have the persecution of the Jews.
"You have militarism and appeals...
"to every form of fighting spirit."
Baldwin won' t like that.
He sincerely believes that Hitler does not want war.
- Baldwin.
- Not just Baldwin, many others.
They' re wrong.
You think so, I think so, but don' t underestimate them.
They admire Hitler.
They won' t like it.
They can lump it.
Order!
"You have dictatorship, most grim dictatorship."
Order!
"You have the persecution of the Jews.
"You have militarism...
"and appeals to every form of fighting spirit."
"We have steadily marched backward since the Great War.
"Fears are greater.
"Rivalries are sharper.
"Military plans are more closely concerted.
"And because of our disarmament, Britain is weaker."
Order!
The right honorable gentleman must be heard!
"The war mentality...
"The war mentality is springing up again.
"Britain' s hour of weakness is Europe' s hour of danger."
Mr. Pettifer.
Mr. Speaker, although one is loathe... to criticize anyone in the evening of his days... nothing can excuse the right honorable member for Epping... for having permeated his entire speech... with the atmosphere that Germany is arming for war.
May I remind the right honorable member that a poll conducted... by the League of Nations found that over 90 percent of the British people... favor international disarmament?
Hear, hear.
And let us not forget... that a child born on the day the Great War ended... is now just old enough to die in the next Great War.
This country wants peace!
People say, "Winston won' t mind.
"He' s used to being shouted at."
They' re wrong... and it hurts deeply.
Especially from your own party.
The Tories don' t want to be make to think.
What you' re saying is right.
That' s what matters.
They don' t listen, that' s what matters.
It' s like banging your head against a bricd wall.
One can' t go on forever.
Most men of my age have retired.
And die.
All those dreams of standing shoulder to shoulder... with Marlborough and all the other heroes...
Stupid nonsense!
If you give up now, then you' il never know.
Give up, give up what?
- There' s nothing to give up.
- You' re depressed, black dog' s barking.
Perhaps he' s barking the truth.
Do you remember last year when Inches fell ill?
It wasn' t the flu, it was something more serious.
- Because he told me not to.
Doctor said he should give up work completely... but he refused.
"Mr. Churchill needs me," he said.
And it' s not just Inches, it' s Mrs. P, the staff... your constituency workers, me, we' re all the same.
You' re only trying to cheer me up.
Don' t.
All these years I' ve put up with... the miseries of political life, because I believe in you... and somehow I survived.
But to have you here all the time in retirement... bad- tempered, getting in everybody' s way.
That is something I just could not survive.
You' re getting pretty good at this.
Ninety bricds an hour, isn' t that right, Harry?
- Nearer to 60, I should say, sir.
- Very well.
Between 60 and 90.
I' ve become a member... of the Amalgamated Union of Building Workers.
- Fully paid up.
- Very good.
This material... you' re feeding me about the German air force... it' s too generalized.
- Facts and figures is what I need.
- That stuff doesn' t come in my direction.
- I don' t think you can.
Top secret, eyes only.
Goes straight to the Foreign Office.
See what you can do.
I got thrashed again in the House, last week.
I need muscle, Desmond.
I need to fight back.
Come in.
I thought you left ages ago.
I' ve been reading this. - drink?
- Yes.
It' s a report from Berlin.
Hitler' s cabinet has approved a new law.
It means, in effect, the compulsory sterilization... of all those suffering from hereditary illnesses... which are deemed, and I quote, "to affect the health of the nation."
Bad.
This is just the beginning.
I' il have a word with the Prime Minister.
Much good that' il do, he' il say it' s German domestic policy.
It has nothing to do with us.
Which is true.
In all honesty, there' s very little I can do, if anything.
You, on the other hand, may think otherwise.
Have you brought any of this to the attention of the government?
I' ve tried.
I' ve sent briefing notes to Mr. Baldwin and all members of the cabinet.
- Nobody pays any attention.
Or at least deliberately kept in the dark.
I' ve made a summary of the figures issued by the government... comparing our military strength with that of Germany.
On the next page are my own figures, which are much nearer the truth.
Germany will soon be strong enough to wage an aggressive war... which is what I believe they intend to do.
Your figures are very precise.
Much more so than the information I have.
Presumably, you have access to other reports, other statistics.
All of it as precise and detailed as this.
Far more detailed.
Then I don' t see how I can help you.
I may be called Director of the Industrial Intelligence Center... but don' t be fooled.
I' m no more than a civil servant.
I have no public voice, which is what you need.
Yes, it is.
In that case, I think you should talk to Winston.
Winston Churchill?
But surely he' s...
Past it?
Then he switches to the Liberals.
Now he' s back with the Tories again.
He has no judgment.
Maybe, but he has an extraordinary instinct.
He knows when something' s important and should be pursued.
He' s wrong about India, of course.
He' s been wrong about a lot of things.
But I believe he' s right about Germany.
I shall be seeing him at the weekend.
I shall be happy to do so.
You' re suggesting that I remove secret documents from a government office... and show them to someone who has no right to see them.
It' s a criminal act.
But perhaps a necessary one.
- Marjorie?
- Yes, Mr. Wigram?
- An envelope, I need a large envelope.
- An envelope?
- Yes, do we have any large envelopes?
- How large?
Just to take some papers.
Just an ordinary large- size envelope.
If you give the papers to me, I' il post them.
What' s the address?
No, it' s nothing to do with work.
Where do we keep the envelopes?
Is this big enough for you?
It' s fine, perfect.
Thank you.
They must be back in the office on Monday morning.
- So, I need them back by Sunday evening.
- You have my word.
If it says, "Don' t walk on the grass," I never do.
Never used to.
- Sunday evening, then.
- Sunday evening.
Out.
Definitely out.
- Can we have some more lemonade?
- No, let' s finish the set first.
Where did you get this?
A chap in the Foreign Office, Ralph Wigram.
Head of the Central Department. - risky business, pinching this.
- Useful?
This' il make the buggers jump.
Half- past 11: 00.
Where the hell is he?
Morton promised.
- Perhaps you should telephone.
- Telephone who?
Don' t they know how important this is?
Hello?
- Mr. Wigram?
- Yes.
Brendan Bracken, just returning that.
Sorry I' m late.
Car broke down, bloody nuisance.
There' s a note in there from Winston.
He' d love to have you come down for Sunday lunch.
He' il be in touch.
Good night.
Good night.
Mr. Churchill.
Mr. Speaker, before I am derided yet again... and before any further insults are hurled at me... in the evening of my days...
It' s nearly midnight, Winston.... let me give you some facts and figures, some food for thought.
Let me describe to you... the method of aircraft manufacture in Hitler' s Germany.
Sit down, Winston, we' ve heard it all before.
This, you will not have heard, I can assure you of that.
Airplanes destined for the Luftwaffe... are not manufactured in one place.
Throughout Germany, a large number of firms... are making seemingly innocent component parts... which are then dispatched to great, central factories... where they are assembled very rapidly... into fighter and bomber aircraft...
like a jigsaw puzzle or Meccano game.
It' s very clever, very effective.
And above all, it conceals the true scale of German rearmament.
I am reliably informed... that the working population of Dessau... a small town near Leipzig... increased last year... by 13, 000 people.
And why was that?
What is manufactured in Dessau that requires... such an enormous influx of workers?
Lager beer?
Lederhosen?
Sausages?
Aircraft.
That is why I say we must act decisively.
And we must act now, to put our defenses in order.
If we do not, history will cast its verdict... with those terrible, chilling words, "too late."
Hear, hear.
Mr. Ferguson, the right honorable gentleman and member for 18 years...
Charlie would so love a dog.
- I' m sure we could find you one.
- Off you go.
We have an absolute menagerie here.
Winston has cats, dogs, geese, dondeys, wild swans... pigs, not to mention the children.
- I don' t know how you manage.
- I' ve written my own epitaph.
"Here lies the woman who was always tired.
"She lived in a world where too much was required."
Less troublesome than portraits.
A tree can' t tell me that I haven' t done it justice.
I don' t know how you find time for painting.
It keeps me sane.
I mean it.
I couldn' t exist without paints and brushes.
The black dog will get me.
Are you a worrier?
Yes, I' m afraid I am.
Then you should definitely take up painting.
It' s good for the spirit, calms the nerves.
What do you worry about?
Almost everything, really.
My wife, my son.
Are they happy?
Will they be all right?
The state of my finances, the state of the world, the state of my roof.
- Your what?
We have a leaky roof.
Every time it rains, it' s a nightmare.
I' m worried about these papers, these documents I' m showing you.
If anyone found out, I' d be in the most terrible trouble.
Nobody will find out, don' t worry.
It' s all strictly confidential.
- May I call you Ralph, if it' s not too sudden?
- Please, do.
The recognizing and acknowledging of fear... is a mark of wisdom.
For example, I can' t stand too near the edge of a platform... when an express train is passing through.
Second' s action would end everything forever.
My doctor says it' s a form of melancholia.
We call it my black dog.
Painting drives it away.
As does bricklaying.
I' m building a wall.
It goes well with writing.
Two thousand words and 200 bricks a day.
What' s the time?
I feel peckish.
- It' s nearly 4: 00.
- I knew it, time for tea.
When we have visitors, we have Dundee cake.
It' s a great treat these days.
I' m particularly fond of Dundee cake.
Come along!
I' il take these, you bring the easel.
And don' t dilly- dally...
Come on, don' t try and fold it up.
It' s a bloody nightmare.
And don' t dilly- dally on the way
I hear you went to Chartwell.
Yes.
I didn' t know you were chummy with Winston.
I' m not, not chummy.
- I wonder what he wants you for.
- What do you mean?
Winston' s so- called friends are people who are useful to him.
The idea of having a friend because you like someone has no place... in his world.
- You have to be very careful.
- What of?
He demands total loyalty.
"Thou shalt have no other gods before me."
Do you know what Lloyd George said of him?
He said he would make a drum of his own mother' s skin... in order to sound his own praises.
walk on.
Who' s this article for?
The Daily Mail.
Damn good, "The Daily Mail".
What more could a fellow ask?
Walter Guinness telephoned this morning.
- How is he?
- He' s very well.
- He' s asked me to go on a cruise.
- A cruise?
Very nice.
It' s more of an expedition, really.
Fine, you' il enjoy a little rest.
Where' s Walter planning to go, south of France?
Komodo.
Komodo, where the hell is that?
Just below the Philippines, near Bali.
That' s halfway around the bloody world.
What on earth makes him want to go there?
- Something to do with catching dragons.
- Dragons?
They' re for the zoo.
Wait a minute.
Walter Guinness is seriously suggesting... going halfway around the world searching for some damn lizard.
- Is that right?
- Yes.
- He must be mad.
What' s the point of it?
- It would be a great adventure.
- You' d be away weeks, months.
- About four months.
Who else is going on this trip?
Evelyn, of course, two of their cousins, and a man called Terrence Phillip.
- Who' s he?
- Art dealer.
We met him at one of Walter' s dinner parties.
And you think it' s all right, do you, to leave us... to go off chasing lizards with Walter Guinness?
What am I supposed to say to that?
Don' t you think it just might be construed as just a little selfish?
Well, don' t you?
Do not dare!
I spent the last 26 years of my life trying to please you.
And I' ve done everything, and I mean everything!
I put your happiness before the children' s happiness... before my happiness!
You are the most self- centered man I have ever met.
So...
don' t accuse me of being selfish.
Don' t you dare.
Sorry, sir.
I thought somebody...
The sprouts misbehaved.
Yes, sir.
Mrs. Pussycat, Mr. Pug is very sorry.
Pussycat, do let me in.
Mr. Pug is very lonely out here.
Mrs. Pussycat, please.
- Mommy, open the window.
- What darling?
- Open the window!
- I can' t hear you.
That' s why you need to open the window!
The leather strap, pull up!
- It won' t budge, you' il have to shout.
- We are shouting.
- Bye, Mommy, find a dragon!
- Pull up on the leather strap!
Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Clemmie.
- Goodbye.
- All right, I think.
Missing her, of course, but that' s to be expected.
No point in dwelling on her absence, we must KBO.
Yes, sir, "keep buggering on" at all times, sir.
KBO, that' s the order of the day.
"We are entering...
"a period of danger...
"and of anxiety."
Comma.
"Let us stop...
"and see exactly..."
No, scrub that.
Bugger.
Thank you, kindly.
"We are entering upon a period of danger...
"and of anxiety."
You' re repeating yourself.
All right, don' t break your heart about it.
"And how do we stand...
"in this long period of danger?"
Pause for emphasis.
look of doom and foreboding.
"There is no doubt...
"that the Germans are superior to us in the air...
"at the present time.
"And it is my belief that by the end of the year...
"they will possibly be three...
"or even four times our strength."
Where did he get all that information?
He makes it his business to be well informed.
I don' t like it, it could do immense damage to our trade with Germany... not to mention the cost of rearmament.
Where does he think the money' s coming from?
I want him isolated.
"Only a short distance away there dwells a nation...
"of nearly 70 millions...
"who are taught from childhood to think of war and conquest...
"as a glorious exercise," comma...
"and death in battle...
"as man' s noblest fate." Stop.
I beg your pardon, Mrs. P.
"To urge preparation of defense...
"is not to assert the imminence of war.
"On the contrary, if war was imminent...
"preparations for defense would be too late.
"However calmly surveyed...
"the danger of an air attack on London...
"must appear most formidable."
- I' m sorry.
- That' s all right.
"London is the greatest target in the world.
"The kind of tremendous, fat, valuable cow...
"tied up to attract a beast of prey.
"We cannot retreat.
"We cannot move London."
Papers.
Get your papers here.
This is all a bit Agatha Christie, wouldn' t you say?
"Daily Express".
"Times".
Get your newspapers.
"Dearest Clemmie, thank you for your letter.
"I am delighted you had such an exciting time in Madras."
Stop.
"Mr. Phillip sounds a most agreeable...
"and adventurous companion." Stop.
"I' ve decided to make...
"the peninsula on the bottom lake into an island...

"The heavy work will be done by a great mechanical digger...
"which does the work of 10 men...

"As you will have heard...
"Randolph was heavily defeated in the by- election...
"and lost his deposit.
"This resulted, of course, a setback for him...
"and should teach him prudence."
The choice is in your hands.
If I achieve anything, they say it' s because of you.
Rubbish.
When I fail, they say, "What a tragedy."
For God' s sake.
I' m not a child, I' m 23, I want to make a life of my own.
Do what you like. make a fool of yourself.
I' m not staying in this bloody house a moment longer.
Bugger.
- Sprouts again, sir?
- Cauliflower.
Keep young and beautiful
It' s your duty to be beautiful
"Mary and I went to see the show...
"that Sarah has got herself involved in.
Not a patch on Gilbert and Sullivan. "
Keep young and beautiful
It' s your duty to be beautiful
Keep young and beautiful if you want to be loved
"Met this wretched man she keeps talking about.

"I dealt with the situation very clumsily, I' m afraid.
"I wished profoundly that you' d been there...
"to offer comfort and advice."
It' s getting deeper in, Richard.
"The accountant has been sadly disappointed.
"And the mechanical digger sank into the mud...
"and finally wallowed himself into an awful pit."
No good, hopeless.
- 98 degrees, sir.
- Very good, Inches, full steam ahead.
Yes, sir, very good, sir.
- Dinner jacket tonight.
- Yes, sir, the looser trousers?
I' m afraid so.
- Car round at 6: 00.
- Very good, sir.
Good morning, Mr. Churchill.
"Your dear letters are the only bright spot in my life, Clemmie.
"I fill my days writing inflammatory articles about Germany...
"and thus incurring the wrath of Stanley Baldwin...
"which pleases me no end."
Have you seen it?
Yes.
You haven' t had much luck as far as Winston is concerned.
He' s more voluble than ever.
He won' t let go of it.
You' ve got to make him.
- Excuse me, sir.
10: 30?
- Yes.
I will not allow him to interfere with government policy... nor indeed with the smooth running of the party machine.
I' il do what I can.
Have a word with someone in his constituency.
Yes, of course.
A word about what exactly?
There must be a large amount of local party members... who were dismayed, not to say alarmed, by his behavior.
Say he' s erratic, totally unreliable.
- Ralph.
- Hello, Van.
- Enjoying it?
lmmensely.
- Winston' s been very active recently.
- Active?
Yes, endless speeches, all those newspaper articles...
"Evening Standard", "Daily Mail", everywhere you look.
- Created a lot of anxiety.
- Not surprising, really.
His information is remarkably detailed.
I' m starting to wonder where it comes from.
Yes, it could, I know.
Winston started to make some real impact.
Slowly but surely, attitudes are changing.
It would be unfortunate if something were to go wrong.
Wrong?
Yes, one has to be very careful.
No unnecessary risks, if you know what I mean.
Yes.
Here we are.
Hello.
Here you are, my darling.
"We must defend our island from foreign aggression." Stop.
All clear.
"We should repudiate all defeatism and passivism." Stop.
Bugger!
West room 93.
It' s for you, sir.
"Our country can only be saved if it is strong."
Ralph, how are you?
I can' t go on with this.
I' m sure they know something.
We have to stop this now.
Listen, Ralph, just a little longer.
I don' t believe we are.
It' s so very important, what you' re doing, Ralph.
You mustn' t stop now.
Ralph, KBO, remember our motto.
Keep buggering on.
Now, I just want to show you the scale, the distance.
There' s the South of England, where we live... and there is Austria, where you went last Christmas with Mommy.
- And you remember how far away that was.
- Yes.
Now, I' il show you where Mommy is now.
Let her go!
Miles and miles away.
"Your desert- island picnic with Mr. Phillip sounds idyilic.
"It is over 11 weeks since you left Chartwell.
- It really is a long way.
- Yeah, it is.
Paragraph.
"Diana' s gone back to her husband."
Comma.
"But I fear the marriage will not last." Stop.
I' m in the middle of a letter!
- Out!
- Really important.
- Who is it?
- Major Sankey.
You should talk to him.
- Now?
He' s been ringing all morning.
All right.
I was in the middle of a letter to my wife, now I' ve lost my train of thought.
Have you no sensitivity?
There' s no need to be insulting, sir.
I was just passing on a message.
How dare you?
Tell the girl to put the call through up here.
- She' s gone to lunch, sir.
I' m not acquainted with the mechanism, sir.
Bloody hell!
- You' re very rude to me, Inches.
- You' re very rude to me, sir.
Yes, but I' m a great man.
You' re a stupid old bugger.
Mr. Churchill' s in trouble.
What do you mean?
Mr. Baldwin, or someone higher up, is trying to get him pushed out.
Of what?
The Conservative Party.
Don' t be daft, they wouldn' t do a thing like that.
They want to shut him up.
Can they do that, Mrs. P?
Just dick him out?
They could, I suppose, yes.
Organize a vote of no confidence, something like that.
- He' d never get over it.
I' il tell you this, Mrs. P.
If they do dick him out, I shall never vote Tory again.
Never!
Not even Liberal.
How dare they?
This is absolutely the worst day of my whole bloody life!
I' m surrounded by enemies.
They call me a warmonger because I speak the blunt truth?
Baldwin is behind all this, Stanley bloody Baldwin!
No better than an epileptic corpse.
"Who is in charge of the clattering train?
"The axles creed and the coupling strain.
"The pace is hot, and the points are near.
"And the signals flash through the nights in vain.
"For Death...
"is in charge of the clattering train."
He' il be needing a glass of champagne.
Possibly two.
Charlie, Mommy' s nearly finished.
Then, I promise, we' il go to the park.
There' s someone to see you, ma' am.
- Who?
- Mr. Pettifer.
Pettifer, to see me?
We' il go in a minute, darling.
What are you reading, Charlie?
Good afternoon, Mr. Pettifer.
Mrs. Wigram.
- I' m afraid my husband' s not home.
- It was you I came to see.
Please, do sit down.
Thank you.
I need your help in a rather delicate and confidential matter.
The Prime Minister feels it would be advantageous... if your husband did not see quite so much of Mr. Churchill.
What do you mean?
It' s perhaps not wise, not good for him.
Not wise for who?
Your husband.
Then shouldn' t you be telling this to my husband?
I' m quite sure he takes note of what you say.
What my husband does is his own business.
I wouldn' t dream of trying to interfere.
No, of course not.
But do remember, your husband' s the head of an important part of the Foreign Office.
It' s not a good idea for him to tell Mr. Churchill what' s going on.
Why?
If indeed he has been.
Please, Mrs. Wigram, don' t let' s argue about this.
Please, Mr. Pettifer, don' t treat me like a child.
If your husband persists in seeing Winston... he may find himself being posted somewhere inconveniently distant... which would, of course, be difficult with regard to your son.
Difficult also, I should imagine... to find the appropriate medical assistance in certain parts of the world.
I dare say, it would mean your having to stay here.
You' ve make a foolish mistake, Mr. Pettifer.
A tactical error.
When a member of the government comes to my house and threatens me so openly... it only shows how important it is... that my husband continue his friendship with Mr. Churchill.
That is my opinion, anyway.
Please, give my regards to your husband.
- Do tell him what I said.
- I think I prefer not to.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Wigram.
- What do you want, Mr. Churchill?
What letter?
I thought there might be something from Clemmie.
Not today.
It' s not easy to post letters in that part of the world.
Perhaps tomorrow.
Does the name "Terrence Phillip" mean anything to you?
Terrence Phillip?
Anything known?
Rather dashing, plenty of money.
His father was rich.
- Married?
- No.
Clemmie seems to be quite chummy with him.
She keeps mentioning him.
- He' s on the boat with her?
- He is.
- I' m idiotically jealous.
- Winston.
- I' m sure she' s in love with him.
- Rubbish.
She writes about him in every letter.
"Terrence and I did this, Terrence and I did that."
- They' re companions, friends on holiday.
I know her thoughts.
Don' t be ridiculous.
She loves you, Winston, very deeply.
- I' m a rotten husband.
- Nonsense.
I suppose he' s the romantic type.
You know, all that sort of stuff.
Never got much of that from me.
It never seemed important, even when I was young.
Daisy Fellowes, she tried to seduce me at the Ritz.
Wasn' t interested.
Used to think it was because I smoked too much.
- Tobacco is bad for love, old age is worse.
"I' ve lived too long, I' m in the ruck I' ve drunk too deeply of the cup
Where did you get that from?
It' s a translation from the Russian.
Pushkin, I believe.
You may laugh, Desmond Morton... but I think about it all the time.
Clemmie and that fellow.
She' il be home soon, Winston.
And say a poor trooper lies low
Get six stalwart lancers to carry me with steps silent, mournful and slow
Mr. Churchill!
Inches, you' re drund.
She' s here, sir.
What?
- Taxi' s coming down the drive, sir.
- What are you talking about?
Mrs. Churchill, sir.
- Yes, sir.
She' s here!
Out of my way!
Lovely.
Thanks very much.
Why are you all wet?
I thought I' d never see you again.
Here I am.
Mr. Inches, how are you?
Wonderful.
I missed you very much.
I missed you, too.
I' m not sure... that I believe that.
You seem to have seen a lot of Mr. Terrence Phillip.
Yes.
You like him?
He' s very interesting.
I hear he' s much in demand.
All the hostesses in London want him at their dinner table.
Yes.
I' m sure they do.
You should ask him here for the weekend.
Did you... fall in love with him?
He made me like him.
Mr. Pug... your new island looks lovely.
At Versailles it was laid down... and at Locarno it was confirmed that Germany was forbidden to take... any armed forces into the Rhineland zone.
And for 18 years, the fortresses of Frankfurt, Koblenz... and the other garrison cities on the Rhine have been empty... but gradually, under dictator Hitler...
Germany has been asserting her independence from treaty obligations.
First, she left the League of Nations... then set about rebuilding her army, navy and air force.
Until today, when her forces play at war and mimic battle...
Germany is seen again to be one of the great armed powers of Europe.
We' re powerless.
Of course we can, and we shall.
I should never have shown you those papers.
What do you mean?
Perhaps the Prime Minister' s right.
Perhaps we should try to find a compromise with "Herr" Hitler.
Don' t be ridiculous, you know that' s impossible.
Then perhaps we should let him have his own way.
For God' s sake, Ralph, what ridiculous nonsense is this?
Ralph, you' re tired.
We should go home.
Hundreds of thousands of people will die.
Millions.
And I shall be responsible.
- Ralph, that' s just not true.
- Partly responsible, then.
How would you be remotely responsible?
By showing those papers to Winston.
By stirring up public opinion.
By making it impossible for the government to reach a settlement with the Nazis.
Hitler is unstoppable.
In three years, he' s made himself dictator of Germany... dumped the Treaty of Versailles, rebuilt the armed forces.
He' il march into Austria, and then Czechoslovakia, and then...
God knows what, the whole of Europe.
There may be a war.
I grant you that.
How can you say that?
It' s just mindless optimism.
When I was in school, I had a friend called Murland Evans... and one day we were talking about what we would do when we were grown up.
And I don' t know why I said this... or why I thought it.
"One day in the future, Britain will be in great danger..." and it will fall to me...
"to save London and the Empire."
I wanted to play for England and go climb Everest.
My destiny.
And I truly believe it.
You' re an extraordinary man, Winston.
I am, I know it.
Nobody but you could say that sort of thing and expect people to believe it.
Destiny is what I believe in.
Destiny commands... we must obey.
Not a very jolly lunch, I' m afraid.
look out for yourself, Ava. take care of Ralph, he needs you so much.
Thank you, Clemmie.
Goodbye.
"All over Europe...
"is the hush of suspense.
"And in many lands, it is the hush of fear.

Hear, hear.
Hello, Winston.
I hear there' s a nonsensical rumor that you' re about to retire.
Please, state that that isn' t the case.
I should be making an official announcement in due course.
But please, be discrete, I don' t want everybody to know.
I' m very surprised.
You' re much loved in the country, Stanley.
I' ve had my day.
I' m exhausted.
You know, some days I am so tired, I can hardly turn over the pages of a book.
We' ve had our differences.
Profound differences.
But I' ve always admired... your great political sdills.
Winston, let me tell you something.
To my mind, war is the greatest folly that can afflict mankind.
- Please, don' t interrupt.
Maybe you' re right about Hitler.
Perhaps this war is inevitable.
But I believe that I am also right.
I have done everything in my power to preserve peace... and I would do exactly the same, all over again.
Bloodshed, sorrow... irreparable loss... that' s what I' ve been hoping to prevent.
But, as I say... you may well be right.
So many telegrams today!
German troops are on the march.
Hence all the telegrams.
Hitler' s planning to invade the world, and we' re planning to do nothing about it.
What do you make of that, Marjorie?
Perhaps we should go home?
Or we could take a stroll in St. James' s Park.
It' s remarkable weather for this time of year, and we' re hardly much use here, are we?
Sorry, Marjorie.
It' s a poor joke.
Thank you for these.
Marjorie, I meant to ask, what time is the defense meeting tomorrow?
I don' t think you' re required at that meeting, Mr. Wigram.
We haven' t received any notification.
Not required?
Fine.
Funny how word gets around.
Thank you very much.
Come on, my little man.
Charlie, it' s snowing, how lovely.
- Ethel, can you manage?
- Yes, thank you, ma' am.
We should go find Daddy in the garden and make a snowman, what do you think?
Oh, silly Mommy.
Silly Mommy!
We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year
- Shall I take him?
- Thank you.
Come on, young man, what you need is a bath!
Good bath.
Be up in a minute.
Ralph?
What' s wrong?
Nothing.
- Drink?
- Please.
The snow has settled.
How wonderful.
So beautiful, like a painting.
You must telephone to the office.
Tell them you won' t be in today.
Just for two or three hours.
It is Christmas, after all.
They' il spare you.
I' m afraid I absolutely forbid you to go to work on a day like today.
Poor turnout from Whitehall.
I know, pretty bloody awful.
We had lunch with him a few days ago, and he was very upset then.
I was quite frightened.
It says a pulmonary hemorrhage on the death certificate.
I think we should leave it at that.
He said it was all pointless, everything he tried to do.
Was it pointless?
His life was very precious to me.
Please, tell me it wasn' t wasted.
Ava, my dear, you' il be very proud of him.
People often act heroically... because they don' t fully appreciate the dangers that lie ahead.
Ralph saw all those dangers and was afraid of them... but he did what he did, in spite of his fear.
No man can be braver than that.
Thank you, Winston.
What is it?
Any invading force... would march across our little bit of England... on their way to London.
I wonder how long we' ve got.
This is London.
You will now hear a statement by the Prime Minister... the right honorable Neville Chamberlain.
I am speaking to you... from the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.
This morning, the British ambassador in Berlin... handed the German government a final note... stating that unless we heard from them by 11: 00... that they were prepared at once... to withdraw their troops from Poland... a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received... and that, consequently... this country is at war with Germany.
Mr. Churchill!
Upstairs, Mrs. P.
- What' s the matter?
- Telephone, sir.
The Prime Minister' s office.
First Lord of the Admiralty, back in power!
Jolly good show, marvelous!
I have been made a member of the War Cabinet.
Mrs. Churchill and I must now make our home in London.
Needless to say, we shall return to Chartwell whenever possible.
Every one of you will be looked after... and either retained here, or found good jobs elsewhere.
Mr. Inches has all the details.
There may be difficult and painful times ahead.
But now that I' m in charge of the Navy...
Mr. Hitler and his Nazi thugs had better look out.
We' re going to teach them a lesson they' il never forget!
Good luck, sir.
Mr. Inches, I think a glass of champagne might be in order.
With respect, sir, I think we might save that for happier days.
Quite right.
However, there' s a good claret you may be interested in.
It is a very good year, I can' t tell you which year.
Not the House of Commons, the Admiralty!
I' ve got a navy to run!
Just before the Battle of Blenheim...
Marlborough said to his aide:
"Today, I conquer or die."
Now I know how he felt.
Thank you.
For what?
I thought I' d never be loved.
At ease.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.
- I' m the new First Lord.
How do you know?
A signal was sent to the fleet this afternoon.
What signal?
"Winston is back," sir.
"Winston is back."
And so he bloody well is!
Gregorio!
(thunder)
They' re all dead!
Massacred!
They' re dead, all of them!
They' re all dead at the Alamo!
(man) Did you hear what he said?
The Alamo!
That' s better.
Smooth.
If it doesn' t burn going down, how can you be sure it' s bad for you?
I' il be interested to see you gentlemen when you arrive in Texas and have your first taste of mescal.
Is it true that men and women imbathe together out in the open?
Cleanliness is next to godliness.
Yes, well... excuse us.
Invest now, gentlemen, or lament later.
I' m a screamer.
I got the roughest racehorse, the prettiest sister, the surest rifle and the ugliest dog in the district.
My old man could lick anybody in Tennessee, and I could lick my old man.
I can outgrin a panther and ride on a lightnin 'bolt, tote a steamboat on my back and whip my weight in wildcats.
Whip...
- What is it?
- He' s here.
- Who' s here?
- He is here!
I' il tell you, these old bones could sure use a respite.
'Course, the good citizens of Tennessee may grant me that wish come next election.
- (laughter)
- Excuse me one moment.
Yes, of course.
Sam Houston.
Makin 'friends wherever you go.
- To Tennessee.
- Oh, to hell with Tennessee.
To Texas.
(man) It' s sad, isn' t it?
A year ago, we' d be looking at two men with their caps set for the White House.
Now...
What you peddlin ', Sam?
Somethin 'a certain Congressman might need before long.
Are you sellin 'rockin' chairs?
I' m sellin 'Texas.
Andwhatwould IwantwithNorteMexico?
David, you remember what Tennessee was?
You come to Texas.
Timber, water, game, cattle, more land than you can possibly imagine.
You take the oath for militia duty, you will receive 640 acres of your own choosing.
- Mm- hmm.
You figure this new republic' s gonna need a president?
Before we begin tonight' s performance,
I should like to acknowledge the presence of the man whose life inspired our humble play.
Good evening, Mr. Crockett.
(laughter. applause)
(Scotsman) You want to call me an opportunist?
Hell, yes, call me an opportunist.
But taking the Alamo changed everything.
- We' re in control now.
- (men) Yes!
We swore allegiance to Mexico under the Federalist Constitution of 1824.
Santa Anna tore that document up personally, did he not?
Named himself supreme dictator?
Well, I, for one, ain' t swearin 'allegiance to no son- of- a- bitch dictator.
(several) Yeah!
(man) Neither am l.
(Mexican accent) Time to go, General.
They are talking crazy.
Drunk back sober.
It' s a miracle of the first order.
Seguin, why' d they put me in charge of the army if they won' t listen to me?
We need to muster and train troops here, not send soldiers all over Texas.
They think Santa Anna' s just gonna hand over part of Mexico without a fight?
They are gonna want you humble, General.
I humble myself before God, and there the list ends.
- (men shouting)
You do not split an army into vagabond militias that march off on the slightest pretext like bloodthirsty rabble.
Do you really believe this war is over?
You opposed Bexar, but victory was ours!
(men) Yeah!
And now you oppose Matamoros, where victory will be as sweet.
No.
Perhaps, sir, you simply oppose fighting.
Fighters shall lead the new country of Texas, sir.
The council will now consider the removal of General Houston from command of the regular army.
- All in favor, show of hands.
The late, great Sam Houston, former governor of Tennessee and now former general of the Texian army.
- Scottish catamite.
- What did you say?
One step down from associate pederast.
- All right.
- (man) Remain clothed!
Come!
Come!
Any excuse to start removin 'your clothes, is that right, Houston?
This is not your concern, Mr. Bowie.
This is between me and the Scottish catamite.
Wanna borrow mine, Grant?
'Cause I' il surely give it to ya.
Buy you a drink?
I didn' t know you drank.
You marked the coat as single- breasted, with a four- inch stand collar?
- (man) As you desired, Mr. Travis.
- Lieutenant Colonel.
And the epaulets are gold bullion?
Should be quite a sight.
Where would you like the uniform sent?
San Antonio de Bexar.
I' il be there defending the Alamo.
The Mexican army left there with their tail between their legs.
Mr. William... she here.
In your office, waitin '.
Your wife.
Mr. Bowie!
- Colonel.
- Buck.
Drunken Hottentot.
Two- bit dandy.
(Travis) Well, the choices are abandonment, adultery, or cruel and barbarous treatment.
I think abandonment' s most accurate.
Any of the choices would be appropriate.
You sure you want to do this?
Well, we- we signed the papers.
I meant Charlie.
I don' t intend this harshly, but he should have a male example in his life.
I' ve already made arrangements for him to stay with a fine family while I' m away.
Well, we have a long way to travel.
Your father' s becoming a rich man, and he' il be able to see to your education.
You' re makin 'a jackass outta yourself, Sam.
Vindictive sons of bitches.
Texas... wasted on the Texians.
They' il come back.
The Mexicans.
A well- trained army, against all this handful of amateurs.
Only chance we have is to fight 'em out in the open.
Forts, they' re useless, useless to us.
What is it about that damn place, anyway?
What place?
The Alamo.
Every time a sour wind blows through, everybody runs there and hides inside.
Ain' tnothin 'butmud.
Acaved- inchurch.
Andcannon.
Cannon.
Protects my home, Sam.
You don' t have no home, any more than I have.
It' s a damn shame about your wife, Jim.
Am I still your general?
You know you are.
I want you to return to the Alamo, fetch the cannon back.
Will you do that for me?
Will you promise that you' il do that for me?
Yeah.
Don' t go causing any fuss.
When I return, we' il get a home of our own.
"One crowded hour of glorious life is worth an age without a name."
(woman) Jim Bowie' s here!
- (man) Know which one he is?
- Right there.
Welcome to San Antonio, Bowie!
- Welcome home, Jim.
Welcome home, Jim.
(man) You all right, Mr. James?
I have a home.
Sir?
(man) We know you guys from somewhere?
(man laughs) (man # 2) Whoo, that one' s pretty dandy, that one.
Halt!
- Have the quartermaster secure billeting.
- Yes, sir.
- Where you going, sir?
- I' d like to see what I' m fightin 'for.
Dismount!
It was founded as a mission 100 years ago.
The Bexarenos called it the Alamo, after Alamo de Parras, a Spanish cavalry unit that moved in 30 years ago.
As you can see, it is not designed with military intentions.
She' s well armed.
Most cannon of any fort west of the Mississippi.
I placed our largest, the 1 8- pounder, on the southwest corner, so it fronts the town.
The north wall is in ruins, so I have two batteries with five cannon to defend it.
Major Jameson, our engineer, is emplacing a palisade between the main gate and the church.
- What was here before?
An indefensible flank.
It still appears indefensible.
Good riflemen and a 12- pounder should hold it.
The church itselfwasn' t built till 1 756.
Was it destroyed in battle?
The Catholics never quite finished it.
Saints Dominic and Francis.
Francis had two gifts: prophecy, and the ability to inspire passionate devotion.
This fort is the only thing that stands between Santa Anna' s army and our settlements.
As goes the Alamo...
so goes Texas.
If the need arises, I recommend you take my personal quarters on the west wall.
They' re isolated, yet near the primary defenses.
I' m afraid I don' t understand, sir.
I have personal matters to attend to in Mina.
I' m leaving you in command.
I know you fought this posting, Travis.
Forting up is not exactly a cavalryman' s dream.
I' il defend it with my life, sir.
Your biggest task will be keeping the volunteers and the regulars from killin 'one another out of boredom.
The Mexican army would have to cover 300 miles in the dead of winter to get here before I return.
- (laughter)
The two that I knocked out are now wakin 'up, realizin' who knocked 'em out.
I' m fine.
'Cause I know I got my trusty, loyal Ward right next to me.
So I turn over my shoulder, and who do I find?
Tortilla lady and her 1 3- year- old hound dog.
Where were ya?
I hate to tell you this, Jim, but you were in the wrong.
That' s when I need you the most.
I love this place.
I love it, too.
Colonel?
You look terrible, almost yellow right around the cheeks and forehead.
You a doctor now, along with everything else?
- Where' d you hear that?
- Men tend to prattle on when they drink.
Your men tend to drink.
It would be a great mistake.
I agree.
And any further discussion on this will be between myself and Colonel Neill.
Colonel Neill left Bexar this morning on personal business.
It' s my command now.
That is a swift rise, Billy.
Might as well break out those long britches.
Your men exhibit no discipline.
If matters don' t change, it will become my duty, as colonel of this post...
Lieutenant colonel.
Restrain your men... or I will.
? Habla ingles. muchachos?
(man) We got 'em, David.
It appears to me that we' re all on the same side here.
What you doin 'out here?
My name is David Crockett.
Crockett of Tennessee?
Davy Crockett?
He prefers "David."
(crowd) Aww!
It' s all right.
- (man) What' d you tell 'em?
- (laughter)
- "I' m goin 'to Texas!"
- (crowd) Yeah!
- Welcome to Texas, Davy.
- Thank you, sir.
- Put your mark on it, Mr. Crockett?
Let me through here.
(Crockett) Absolutely.
"I' m half alligator, half snappin 'turtle."
"I can slide off a rainbow and jump the Mississippi in a single leap."
Tell 'em, Davy, how you can whup your weight in wildcats.
I seen you onstage.
Well, that wasn' t me.
Why, sure it was.
He was performin 'a character.
Say the lines.
Davy Crockett, the Lion of the West.
I dare San- tanna to show his face now you' re here.
Well, I understood the fightin 'was over.
Ain' tit?
(shouts in Spanish)! Alto!
- (soldier shouts) - (women scream)! Fuego!
Well done.
You don' t have the sand to even talk to two of my men, much less arrest them.
I told you I intended to restore order.
None.
I have absolute command.
Break 'em out, boys.
Yeah.
'Cause it' s gonna be a cold day in hell anybody takes orders from a debtor who leaves his pregnant wife in the middle of the night.
How about a land swindler who marries a girl, God rest her soul, for her father' s money?
Whoa, whoa, fellers!
Just 'cause we ain' t got nobody to fight don' t mean we need to fight one another.
We should do this democratically.
A vote.
- What about Colonel Crockett leadin 'us?
- No, I' m with you fellers, not above you.
All for the lieutenant colonel, raise your hand.
No repercussions.
All infavorofmecommanding.
Andallforme?
(softly) All right.
Regulars can' t be led by a volunteer.
It' s illegal.
You don' t like the outcome, you change the rule?
Aw, don' t fret about it, Jim.
We all know who' s in charge.
You know, I don' t know why we had to tent up outside of town when there are so many fine houses with big corn- husk beds just sittin 'empty.
Why are they empty?
Apparently some of the folks hereabouts seem to think the Mexicans is comin 'back.
Most of the boys think they wouldn' t be here till late spring if they come at all.
- Figure they know something we don' t?
- Mijito. cierre la puerta y ven para aca.
(woman) Tell me what is going on!
We' il never be able to defend the town.
(Travis) Orderly withdrawal into the Alamo.
- Greys fall in!
- Close up!
Shoulder arms!
Forward!
Orderly withdrawal!
You' re fine.
- (woman) Almeron!
- (man) One, two, one, two.
Almeronl (man) Susanna!
(man) Let' s go, men!
Follow me!
Come on!
I' m sorry to disturb you, but we got quite a mare' s nest out here.
I have to get couriers out while there' s still time.
You and your men will defend the palisade.
The palisade?
You talkin 'about that little old bunch of sticks over there?
You prefer a different assignment?
No, that' s the one
If you could oversee manning the walls, it would be a help.
We should have six men to a cannon, 18 tubes, - which works out to...
- 108 men.
And we should have a man with a musket every four feet of wall.
We' re gonna need more men.
! Viva Santa Anna!! Viva Mexico!
Godspeed.
Sir.
Colonel, you should see this.
We' re gonna need a lot more men.
What is Colonel Bowie doing on the bridge?
Tryin 'to talk us out of the spot we' re in.
Fire the 1 8- pounder.
- Sir?
- You heard me.
Fire the cannon.
Prime the gun.
Fire!
Manuel.
I had nothing to do with this.
You out of your mind?
- I' m trying to get us a truce!
- A truce?
If we broker a cessation, we will do so from a position of strength, not weakness.
Otherwise, we have said nothing, and this conflict means nothing.
Dyin' for nothin 'means shit to me.
- Shit!
(wheezes) (man) David.
Buck.
Perhaps, Colonel, they' il only execute the officers.
I think we all just got promoted.
Looky here.
Within a few days all of Texas will know our situation.
Tell me, Buck, in Alabama, precisely how many is "a few"?
No.
Excelencia.
Ah.
Crockett?
Si.
Alteza.! Excelente!
You know, personally, David,
I' d just as soon take my chances fightin 'out in the open.
Hell, I don' t like being hemmed in any more than you do, but here we sit.
(Bowie) Avoid cluster at all times.
Keep your eyes set for crossfire.
Pack plenty of grease wrap balls, put 'em in your blocks.
You may be a- firin 'fast, but not yet.
Load all your muskets and stack 'em, but don' t powder' em.
Oh...
And nomoreofthis, byanybody.
Go to it, boys.
- (coughing) - Here we go, sir.
That' s right.
- (Bowie coughs and wheezes) - Take it in.
It burns.
- But, sir...
I smell like a skunk' s ass.
Jim, what ails you, exactly?
Consumption.
Pneumonia.
One or all.
Exactly.
She' s a dandy, all right.
That knife fight you got into, sand bar over in Natchez...
It was the one that got you written up.
That all true?
You believe everything you read now?
I didn' t read it, I heard it.
And the way I heard it, he put a sword cane and two shots in you.
I don' t remember.
Figure ol 'Sam will be down here pretty soon.
When he gets here, we' il have a good ol 'time.
Itwas three shots.
Sword came through my lung and went through my hand, and then I cut his heart out.
Those ain' t bears out there.
Davy?
Why in the hell do you suppose they don' t just attack us?
I seen vaqueros spend all day long just killin 'one bull.
You bring a band, you' re countin 'on havin' something to celebrate.
Mighty nice of 'em to serenade us like this.
It' s a cavalry march, but I' m told Santa Anna fancies it for other uses.
He borrowed it from the Spaniards, the Spaniards from the Moors.
- It' s called "Deguello." - Kinda pretty.
Deguello means "slit throat."
Now, ain' t that pretty.
(man) Get down!
Get down!
! Fuego!
(men shouting)! Fuego!! Fuego!
(man) Fire!
(man) Watch the north wall!
! Fuego!! Fuego!
(man) Keep your heads down, boys!! Fuego!
(man shouting orders in Spanish) (sobbing)! Fuego!
! Fuego!! Fuego!
Mornin '.
Mornin '.
Yes, sir.
I need a head count for Jim Bowie.
Yes, sir.
Notice how you can' t really hear it until it stops?
Until they decide to attack, I suspect we' il be bombarded on a nightly basis.
Deprive us of sleep.
They want you to start seeing ghosts everywhere.
Colonel, I became a little heated with you in front of your men.
It was ill- advised and not terribly professional.
Don' t worry about it.
Most of my men didn' t even understand the words you were usin '.
It' s important that you and I agree.
For me, though we are poorly supplied, surrender is not an option.
I submit that we engage and delay until reinforcements arrive.
Sometimes, it' s just the way you say things, Travis, that' s all.
I swear to God.
Down!
(man # 2) Down!
Down!
Down!
To the left.
In.
Do you notice anything different about them cannon?
They moved 'em closer last night.
This will be the spot.
I need you to be diggin 'a new one here.
Now we got to find it for 'em, too.
David, you said you wanted to see him.
There he is, the Napoleon of the West.
Which one?
- That' s Santa Anna?
- Yeah.
He' s quite the peacock, isn' t he?
Wind kicked up.
! Infanteria!
Saquen sus canones.
(soldier shouts order in Spanish)! Fuego!
Take cover!
Take that ball to Captain Dickinson.
We can reuse it.
You' il be pickin 'that up yourself.
Well, I' il be.
- Cut it to shot and send it back to 'em.
- Yes, sir.
Fire the cannon.
Fire!
(Travis) Fire once from each cannon!
You heard the colonel.
Lieutenant colonel, Colonel.
Let' s give 'em a taste!
- (man) Let' s give 'em hell!
Come on, get up here!
Andfire!
Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
At this very moment our soldiers are held in the Alamo against a force of thousands.
They put their hopes in Colonel Fannin. who. despite his pedigree. has proven himself ill- equipped to lead. much less march. an army.
This is from Colonel Travis.
"I call on you in the name of liberty to come to our aid with all dispatch."
I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier, who never forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his country: victory or death. "
(Houston) Gentlemen...
I will raise an army.
We will relieve the Alamo.
But only after we have declared independence and created a government that can be legally recognized by all the nations of the world.
That... is what every besieged man in the Alamo is fighting for.
(Travis) We have no idea if any of our couriers made it out.
- You know the land and the language.
- You are asking me to leave my men.
I' m asking you to deliver a message to Houston and return with a response.
I' m ordering it.
Don' t give him too much water.
He drinks too much, he ain' t worth a damn.
I' il bring him back to you, Santiago.
You bring yourself back.
Captain... go with God.
Makes a man ponder the possibilities, don' t it?
What happened to your cap?
Crawl away?
I only wear it when it' s extra cold.
I only started wearing that thing... because of that feller in that play they did about me.
People expect things.
Ain' titso
- Can I ask you something?
- All right.
Now, which was tougher, jumping the Mississippi or riding that lightning bolt?
Can you catch a cannonball?
If it was just me, simple old David from Tennessee,
I might drop over that wall some night and take my chances.
But that Davy Crockett feller, they' re all watchin 'him.
He' s been on these walls every day of his life.
He' s burning with fever.
Try to get him to drink something not whiskey.
Sam, get me some sheets and cold mud.
I have issued orders for Colonel Fannin to retreat from Goliad.
John Forbes is mustering more men throughout South Texas and bringing them to Gonzales.
I expect 1 500 men to be there when I arrive.
We will march out, circumventing Santa Anna' s army, and relieve the Alamo from the west, withdrawing back to the Colorado and establishing on a line southeast from Beason' s Crossing to Brazoria.
You will have command of the regular army.
The militias will have their own command.
I will command all or none.
You do your calling, and I shall do mine.
I will lead an army.
You will birth a nation.
Gentlemen, to Texas!
(men) To Texas!
Here they come!
Here they come!
Position the cannon!
Muster!
(command in Spanish) (man) Move back!
They' re measuring our strength.
Prepare yourselves.
Fire at will, gentlemen!
Captain Dickinson!
Aiml Fire
Run, you rabbits, run!
Them jacales out there offer pretty good cover.
I wouldn' t mind stretching my legs.
- (soldier) Burn 'em down.
Yes, sir.
Get that first one, right there.
What' s your name, boy?
Thatta boy!
Fine shootin ', boy.
Muy bien.
(man) Watch the north wall!
Over there.
What are they working at?
I want you to throw up your hands and holler,
No disparo. "
What' s that?
Mexican law said there ain' t no slaves, right?
- Yeah.
- And contract or no, that' s what you is.
Now, the Mexicans see your color, you tell 'em, "Don' t shoot." They pass you by.
But Mr. William, he gonna give me a gun, and I' il...
Damn if you ain' t gonna die for 'em, too.
