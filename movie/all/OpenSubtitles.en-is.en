"Information"... the very nature of the word is beginning to change.
The world is shrinking.
Borders are collapsing... cultures are growing closer and closer day by day.
Information is the new unexplored frontier.
And in the forefront of this new age is, of course... the Internet.
Are you sure this is a big story?
"Scoop," Joaquim.
The proper term is scoop.
And, yeah, I' m sure.
Cute secretaries don' t lie.
Well...
Hank, you' re my hero.
- Hey, where are you going?
- Press.
Do you have an appointment?
There' s a coup going on in that boardroom.
That' s news.
You need an appointment to get in.
7tv, Hank Robinson, right there.
Okay, rock and roll.
- Public broadcasting?
- Is that a problem?
Take it easy, Hank.
No, take it easy?
I' m not going to take it easy.
I don' t need this guy keeping me out of here... because he doesn' t like the company I' m working for.
How come he waltzes through?
Señor Aribau has the exclusive rights to all Nova communications.
The number of people who get their news from the Internet... as opposed to, you know, TV or newspapers... grows by 1 million worldwide each year.
One million.
Just follow my lead, and it' il be fine, okay?
Good morning, Christina, you look beautiful.
Can I see the boss?
Just a minute, please.
The conclusion is obvious.
He who controls the Internet... controls information.
In the last three years, Nova communications... have carved a widening niche in the telecommunications market.
Well, I believe it' s time we expanded.
Did you call the press, Señor Pla?
No, I did not.
If you think something newsworthy is going to happen today... you are very much mistaken.
You may be our main stockholder, but I' m still president of this company.
I direct policy.
Nothing will change that.
Hank Robinson reporting from Barcelona.
I am standing in front of the headquarters of Nova... the fastest growing telecommunications company in Spain.
Today, majority shareholder Manuel Pla is challenging Nova president Sert... inside the boardroom, while I stand out here in the parking lot.
Come on, let' s go again.
Take two.
What' s this?
This is my offer, Señor Sert.
Quite generous, I think.
You' re trying to buy me out?
We get a two- shot and we go to lunch, okay?
Everybody down!
Now!
- Don' t move!
- Oh, no!
What the hell is that?
What the hell is going on here?
- What' s the meaning of this?
- Oh, my God!
Jesus Christ!
Let' s go.
- Go?
Go where?
- In there, where the story is.
You know what else is in there?
Someone with a gun.
- Give me the camera.
- No!
Fine.
Nothing is worth dying for, man.
- Call the police, I' m going in.
- Hank.
- Who are you people?
- We are Anarchy Now.
Your company spreads lies to confuse innocent people.
Gunfire at the Nova offices.
Always make sure there' s film in the camera.
You support the capitalist pigs.
This is your reward.
All of you, get out of here!
Come on, run!
Run!
Tell everyone the truth.
Boss!
Listen, call Veronica.
Tell her I' ve got footage of Sert' s murder.
Acts of terror have become so commonplace in our age... that we run the risk of becoming used to their images... to becoming desensitised to them.
The day that these shocking, horrific images fail to appal us... is the day that we begin to lose some of our humanity.
Let' s let these images speak for themselves.
I, for one, will not soon forget them.
- My favourite part' s coming up.
- This is Hank Robinson reporting... with a 7tv news exclusive.
And we' re out.
Pure genius.
It helps to have the hottest producer in town.
All the major wires called.
They want to licence your video.
- Bleed them dry.
- And our ratings are climbing.
We got 20 share tonight.
Thousands of people tuned in.
- How does it feel being a star?
- Twenty share?
Speaking as your producer, I' m thrilled.
Speaking as your girlfriend... don' t ever risk your life like that again.
With great risks come great rewards.
What you did was the most inspiring thing I' ve ever seen.
Veronica.
That tape...
The thing is...
- I just -- - Proved to the world... what I' ve always known.
You' re the real deal, Hank.
I love you.
And I don' t want to lose you.
I love you, too.
I have to rinse.
Yes, I understand all that, but just get him for me.
At 3: 00, you' re interviewing Cardinal Rosselli.
- I thought he never meets the press.
- He agreed to talk to you.
This is a real scoop.
Ronnie.
I' m getting audio interference on Camera 2.
- Interference?
- Either God' s talking to us... or it' s someone' s cell phone.
His polls are rather low.
Excuse me, sir.
Can' t you see the sign?
I' m most terribly sorry.
Very thoughtless of me.
Nicola, I' il have to call you back.
I' m Archibald McGovern.
And you are Veronica Nadal.
Top of your class of the Barcelona School of Journalism.
1999?
'98, actually.
I' m here to see Mr. Robinson.
So, this is 7tv.
Well, it' s quaint.
Is your studio fully soundproof?
Of course.
Some of the equipment has been here since the '60s.
That' s all, it needs to be replaced.
A journalist of Mr. Robinson' s stature deserves better.
We are only a local station, we take what we can get.
- Jordi, what the hell are you doing?
- Sorry, Miss Nadal.
You can start by replacing him.
Excuse me.
Hank Robinson?
Archie McGovern, owner --
And CEO of Vision Television News.
Pleasure to meet you.
I' m sorry, this will have to wait.
Hank goes on in 10 minutes.
Have you met Veronica, my producer?
Oh, yes, indeed.
And I will only take five.
You have to forgive her.
She' s a little protective.
And rightly so.
You' re her gold mine.
So that' s McGovern.
Seems like a nice guy.
Yeah, that' s just what they said about Hitler.
Let' s get Hank' s sound levels up.
- WeIl, we did start 7tv together.
- Shall we?
- It' s kind of our baby.
Scrimping and scavenging for every cent... hunting down stories, hoping and praying for the exclusive... that would put you on the map.
I know it very well.
So tell me, Hank, how many viewers does 7tv get a week?
70, 000?
100, 000?
55, 000, sir.
Vision TV... is watched by 10 million people every night, and growing.
I know, sir.
What can I do for you?
Mr. Robinson, I' m here on a rather serious matter.
The late Carlos Aribau.
Did you know that he worked for me?
Yes, he was a wonderful reporter.
He' il be missed.
On the morning of the Nova attack, I sent Carlos to interview Señor Sert... and then, your story came to my attention.
Mr. Robinson, you represent...
Well, Hank, you represent everything... that Vision TV has come to stand for.
And I would like you to join our family.
I beg your pardon?
That' s right, Hank, your gravy train has come in.
I' m going to have to talk to someone about that.
I' m sure she will realise what a grand opportunity this is for you.
- Bring her along if you like.
- Thank you, sir.
Of course he wants to hire you.
Guys like McGovern are afraid of guys like you.
You report the story.
McGovern, he reports the official story.
- He gets us into 10 million households.
- Yeah, but at what price?
My father worked for 10 years before the networks called... and when they did, he jumped at it.
Hank, we are so close to achieving everything we wanted.
- Don' t throw away our independence.
- It' s a good thing.
- This is a good thing.
- You made a decision like that without me?
- I' m your partner, I' m your girlfriend.
- They promised to hire you.
I already have everything I' ve ever wanted.
At least, I thought I did.
Veronica, please sit down.
Women.
- Let me buy you a drink.
- No, I got to go.
I think you' re doing the right thing.
Vision TV, man.
That' s a big time.
- Yeah.
- Need a cameraman?
I' il bet they probably do.
I' il ask them, all right?
You do that.
- Hank.
- Yeah?
My camcorder... the one you filmed your Nova story with.
It wasn' t loaded.
Sure it was.
No, it wasn' t.
I number all my tapes.
It was empty.
What' s your point?
None of my business how you got the story.
Just share the wealth, you know?
I' m a talented guy, and I' m shooting porn to make ends meet.
It' s a fucking crime.
Are you blackmailing me?
No, I would never do that.
We' re friends, right?
- Yeah.
- Friends do friends favours.
- Sure they do.
- So, good karma.
- We understand each other.
- Oh, yeah.
- We understand each other.
- Terrific.
I' il be seeing you, Hank.
Hey, hombre, that' s my beer.
Hey, Hank!
Here' s to us.
Partners forever!
Okay.
I can' t get this all done.
No, you' re not listening to me.
Birth of a Nation:
The Founding of Iran by Howard Robinson.
Your father' s book was required reading in class.
Barcelona School of Journalism.
I' m Marisa Perez.
I' m your assistant.
This is my first job.
Hello, Marisa.
It' s my first time having an assistant.
Miss Markham is waiting for you in the newsroom.
- Of course, Nicola Markham.
- Yeah, she' s our news director.
All right, the Chinese plan to have a man on the moon by the end of the year.
Right, if their entire population stands on each other' s shoulders.
- You' re late.
- Sorry, I didn' t realise there was a meeting.
News happens every day, Robinson, and every day we report it.
That' s why we are called a news service.
Eduardo, the Chinese astronaut is yours, a present from me.
And next, in Africa, AlDS epidemic is at an all- time high.
Katrina, you run with that.
And in local news, Barcelona is once again in the Champion' s League.
Make it the lead story.
Okay, what are you waiting for?
Impress me.
- Not so fast, Robinson.
- Call me Hank.
Robinson, how the hell did you end up in Spain?
I thought there were more career opportunities in Europe.
Meaning you couldn' t cut it stateside.
If you want to last here, you will follow instructions, claro?
- Claro.
- Good.
Manuel Pla set his sights on his main rival, Intertel.
If Pla succeeds in purchasing Intertel... he will have a virtual monopoly on the telecommunications market.
- First Spain, then Europe.
- Precisely.
I want you to interview Eloy Agustin, the head of Intertel.
Find out why he won' t sell, and what he intends to do about it.
- Questions?
- No, ma' am.
Good.
I was in Tehran with your father during the revolution.
You look a lot like him.
I hope I' m half the reporter he was.
Careful what you wish for.
Señor Agustin, you' re dealing with a hostile takeover bid from Nova.
How are you planning to deal with the threat?
I have faith in the loyalty of my stockholders.
They realise Nova is trying to force everyone out of business.
That may be, but we deal in a free market society.
Can you really fault them their success?
Think of a world in which one company provided every service.
Without competition, there is no need to maintain quality, or accountability.
Information should belong to everyone.
The Internet should be free.
Unregulated.
Thank you, sir.
This is Hank Robinson reporting from Intertel.
We have the edit suite booked for noon... so with any luck, we should be done tomorrow afternoon.
- Are you enjoying your new job?
- I am, yes.
Your predecessor, Carlos Aribau, was a friend of mine.
- Was he?
- Did you know him?
Our paths crossed briefly.
Listen, I' d love to chat, but I must run.
- Thank you.
- Of course.
Good luck.
I hope this business doesn' t victimise you the way it did Carlos.
What do you mean?
You know what it' s like... trying to weed out the liars from the honest men.
In the end, Carlos trusted no one.
Not even his best friends.
- Hello.
- Did I wake you?
Who' s this?
You' ve got 45 minutes.
Time for a piss and a shower.
Hurry up.
I' m not going anywhere until you tell me your name.
Nova, Hank.
The Anarchist attack, remember?
You didn' t sit on your ass.
You went out there and got the story.
What do you want?
The Gothic Knights bar, Robinson.
45 minutes.
And, hey, make sure there' s film in the camera this time, okay?
Nothing personal.
You' ve seen too much.
Señor Agustin... wants you dead.
- Did you confront Agustin?
- Of course.
He got uptight... claimed his private life was nobody' s business.
Sounds like he doesn' t know this girl is a killer.
He knows.
He' s hiding it.
- Conjecture.
- It all fits.
Who' s Agustin' s biggest rival?
Nova.
Who did the terrorists attack?
Nova.
Who benefits?
Agustin.
- Talk about aggressive business practices.
- It' s still all conjecture.
We operate on facts.
I saw her face.
You' re a reporter.
Your word isn' t proof.
You need corroboration.
Nicola may be a bit overzealous at times, but she has a point.
- Yes.
- Looking forward to seeing it.
- You' il have to excuse me.
- Thank you for your time.
Mr. Robinson?
Manuel Pla.
I recognise you from TV.
- And the lovely...
- Marisa Perez.
Marisa is my assistant.
- Pleasure.
- Congratulations.
Your company' s fortunes have really turned around.
Well, in part thanks to Mr. Robinson.
He made us famous.
And if we succeed on acquiring Intertel...
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Thank you.
Would you like a drink?
Sure.
Scotch is great, thanks.
Hi.
How are things?
Fine.
I mean, sure, we' re in a ratings slump right now... but we' il turn it around.
I' ve met a few young reporters with a lot of potential.
You look beautiful.
So, that' s your date?
- Marisa?
Yes, she' s my intern.
- Is that what they call it now?
I miss you.
A lot.
Can we get together?
I' ve left some of my things at your place.
Well, come on by.
Anytime.
I' ve got a story to cover.
TV.
It must have been scary.
- What' s that?
- Alone, filming the Anarchists.
They weren' t just angry young kids with cap guns.
Top- of- the- line Uzis, classic commando assault.
I' d say they had training, financing, backing.
Someone developed Anarchists Now.
And that someone is running the show.
I' m sorry, I didn' t get your name.
I' m a cop.
Brechner, Interpol.
- On duty?
- Always, keeping an eye on things.
Don' t want a repeat of the Nova incident, do we?
Agent Brechner, you mind if I ask you a few questions?
- You on duty?
- Always.
Why not?
You identified any of the anarchists?
We have our suspicions.
One of them is a woman.
- You know her name?
- Do you?
I have a story.
My bosses won' t let me run it until I get corroboration.
- If I show you a picture, can you confirm it?
- You can' t name me.
Anonymous source.
What do you need?
Her name is Leila Krtolica.
Anarchy Now' s aim is to create chaos... to destabilise governments, eventually create a new world order.
Businesses represent capitalism to them, their most hated enemy.
Already this year they' ve claimed 28 victims.
Leila made Interpol' s most- wanted in June.
- Now she' s in Spain.
- But what' s her connection to Agustin?
Terrorists need funding.
It' s hard to blow up bombs on an empty stomach.
You tell me Eloy Agustin is a sponsor of terrorism?
According to my Interpol source.
They' ve been watching him for years.
Looks like you' ve got your corroboration, Nicola.
Okay, Robinson.
Impress me.
What is the connection between Anarchy Now operative Leila Krtolica... and Eloy Agustin of Intertel?
Agustin' s greatest rival.
Coincidence?
Señor Agustin has denied any connection with any terrorist group... and maintains he is the victim of a frame- up.
Cut.
- Thoughts?
- Not bad.
Careful.
You don' t want to hurt yourself praising.
You did your job.
What do you want, a cookie?
We' il lead with it tonight.
Happy?
Jesus, Veronica, I thought you were looking for...
- So what are you doing here?
- I told you, I left some things behind.
You weren' t home.
I still have my key.
Which reminds me.
So long, Hank.
I' m sorry.
I' m just...
Sorry, I' m a little high- strung lately.
I saw your report tonight.
- You watch Vision TV?
- Only when you' re on.
- And?
- You did good.
I' m happy for you.
Thanks.
Careful, Hank.
I am humbled by the trust I' ve been given in being appointed Nova' s new CEO.
I vow to lead Nova and its new acquisitions... with integrity and vision, into a prosperous future.
Intertel stockholders voted unanimously to sell their company to Manuel Pla.
Señor Agustin, meanwhile... is under investigation by the Chief Magistrate' s office.
This is Hank Robinson with Vision TV signing off.
Didn' t your father ever teach you to keep your powder dry?
Your story on Agustin caused quite a stir.
I' ve had the Chief Magistrate on the line all morning.
Just the result of good journalism, I guess, sir.
Yes.
Free publicity is priceless.
Actually, I was thinking more about the social value.
We exposed killers.
Ever wonder what a limey like me was doing in Spain?
I love it.
Still virgin territory, pure.
It' s waiting to be developed.
The rest of Europe is so cynical.
It' s too knowing.
And together we going to make this city the centre for world news.
And I have faith in you.
We' re onto something wonderful.
You can' t learn to be a journalist from a book.
Didn' t they teach you anything at school?
Yes.
We had a saying.
"Believe nothing of what you hear, and half of what you see."
That' s a good motto.
Hello?
Yes, he is.
Hold, please.
You' ve got a call on Line 1.
Thank you.
Hello.
Good morning, partner.
Caught your piece last night.
Good job.
You going to give me your name this time?
Call me Crusader.
Okay, Crusader... how did you know that Agustin was sponsoring terrorism?
A magician never explains his tricks.
Listen... why me?
You' re a rising star, Hank.
You could go far.
I look forward to working with you for a very long time.
Listen, how do I get a hold of you if I need you?
You were handed the story on a silver platter.
- What are you complaining about?
- I don' t trust him, or like him.
You' re beginning to sound like Carlos Aribau.
He thought his sources were cooking up stories.
What?
Okay, I know what this is about: fear of success.
You' re on the verge of surpassing your father...
- and the thought of it scares you.
- Bullshit.
Just do your job!
Here, another early story by Carlos Aribau.
Anything interesting?
The usual.
Local news, some crimes, some human interests.
You' re a walking encyclopaedia, Marisa.
Listen... - how did Aribau make it big?
- I heard, out of nowhere, he got a lead.
Something really big.
Out of nowhere?
Aribau had a secret source.
He never revealed who it was.
Probably never knew.
After that big story that make him famous... he was offered a job at Vision TV, and the rest is history.
Yeah, what was it?
That first big job?
Industrial espionage.
Some telecommunications companies has been accused of violating antitrust laws.
Aribau would champion their cause and prove their innocence.
I was in high school, but I remember it was a big deal at the time.
Manuel Pla.
Manuel Pla would have been ruined, but Aribau saved him.
The attack on Nova, Agustin' s downfall.
Pla benefited.
Señor Agustin?
Señor Agustin, we need to talk.
This is my home.
For 20 years!
I founded this company, and you...
- You took it away!
- We were set up.
The both of us.
Now, how did you meet the girl?
She came up to me, at the conference.
She was interested!
You are a man.
A woman that beautiful is interested in you, do you chase her away?
She said you wanted me dead.
And you believed it.
You, the great reporter!
I made a mistake.
I' ve been in business for a very long time.
This isn' t over yet.
Tell me what you know.
I asked my own questions, hired my own investigators.
She' s no terrorist.
She' s a cold, methodical killer.
- She' il kill for you if the price is right.
- Are you telling me she' s a mercenary?
The Americans have a term for people like her.
They call them "security contractors."
- Who hired her?
Manuel Pla?
- Pla?
- Only a fool.
Others behind him.
- Tell me who, Señor Agustin.
Tell me.
God, it' s them.
You brought them here!
Señor Agustin.
No!
You did all you could, Mr. Robinson.
You are a hero.
A hero would have saved him.
Two assailants, one male, one female.
Anything you can remember about them?
They had on, what do you call it?
The motorcycle mask.
I' m sorry.
One moment, please.
- Robinson.
- Don' t say another word.
Are you all right?
- Everything is fine.
- Yeah, everything is fine.
- It' s an important call.
- It' s an important call.
Take your time.
Listen, you son of a bitch, I am onto you.
You set up Agustin.
Don' t be so melodramatic.
Take a deep breath, calm down.
I am coming after you.
Do you understand?
I don' t exist, Hank.
I' m a whisper, a breath on the other end of the line.
You set up Agustin and you set me up.
You want me dead next?
I do hope it doesn' t come to that.
I' m enjoying our relationship.
I have many, many more stories to tell you.
You can' t manipulate me.
I' m not Carlos Aribau.
No, you' re worse.
Carlos never stepped on corpses to get a story.
- McGovern.
- Hank!
- Have you been in an accident?
Agustin has been murdered.
He was strangled, and left hanging like a piece of meat.
- Murdered?
- Yes.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
- The police are calling it suicide.
- What?
They found a note in his home, and there is an eyewitness.
What are you talking about?
That' s insane.
I saw it, I was there.
All right, Hank, I believe you... but this is a news service.
You' il never get this past Nicola without proof.
Markham.
What time did it happen?
Take it easy.
I got some bad news.
It' s about Agustin --
Feeling the unyielding hand of the law closing in on him... and filled with remorse over his terrorist activity... he lynched himself.
McGovern scooped you.
But... how did he know?
Veronica?
Okay, come on, everybody, run!
Give me the fucking gun!
Veronica, hi, it' s me.
Listen, can you meet me at the station?
So, Hank, how are they treating you at Vision TV?
Good?
- Can' t complain.
- Do you get overtime?
'Cause we don' t.
- Pedro.
- Did they give you an assistant?
- Yeah.
- Is she a babe?
Pedro, the tape.
Well, the tracking' s screwed up.
- Was the camera damaged in any way?
- Well...
We could dump both picture and sound on a computer... and run a component program.
I' ve got just the thing for that.
The computer would digitally adjust the tracking.
It could clean up over 90% of your sound and image.
- How long is that going to take?
- A day.
Do it.
Now, about your assistant?
Okay, Pedro.
Thank you very much.
She' s a slave master.
You' re lucky you escaped when you did.
Let me see if I understand.
The Anarchy Now attack... it was all a ploy to disguise Sert' s murder.
They killed the president of Nova so that Manuel Pla could take over... and they framed Agustin so Pla could control Intertel, right?
You were a witness.
You saw everything.
- Why didn' t you expose them?
- I didn' t know what I had.
The first time I looked at the tape, it looked like a bunch of static.
What do you mean, "the first time"?
You shot this, didn' t you?
Whose tape is this?
Carlos Aribau' s.
Veronica, come on!
You robbed a dead man.
Have you no shame?
They examined the tape.
- Why didn' t they catch this?
- Because I gave them a dub.
I kept the original.
I hid it.
- They are going to crucify you.
Why did you do it?
- Because...
All my life, I wanted to...
I just...
It was there.
I saw it.
It was in my hand, I just took it.
I just did it.
I just took it.
I' m not this guy.
I' m not.
Marisa.
Good luck.
Mr. McGovern?
I bet you think you' re quite the hotshot.
Is there a problem, sir?
You, Robinson, and your story.
Your story on Agustin put us at the top of the ratings.
Congratulations.
I know someone who' s going to be very happy with his Christmas bonus this year.
- Wow.
Thank you.
- Don' t mention it.
You know, maybe as a follow- up, you should do a story on Nova.
You know, how Manuel Pla saved the company after the terrorist attack... and turned its fortunes around.
Fair and balanced, of course.
- Of course.
- Good.
An Agent Brechner from Interpol called three times this morning.
"The Great Game."
It' s a term the British used during World War I for espionage.
They used people as game pieces and the world as a board.
A board game.
Kind of like Monopoly.
Except in Monopoly, the game pieces don' t die.
- Listen, Agustin was murdered.
- I know.
There' s a new player in the game.
Leila' s partner, Paul Wolf.
Six feet tall, German, very professional.
Listen, I' ve been getting calls, anonymous tips.
I' m thinking this Wolf may be using me somehow.
What?
As a patsy, to cover up his crimes.
I don' t know.
Goddamn terrorists.
Now they' ve joined the media.
Why didn' t you tell me sooner?
I' m a reporter.
I was hoping for a scoop.
Don' t be an idiot, Robinson.
These people will eat you for breakfast.
If they contact you again... please, let me know.
Day or night.
- Consider me...
- A friend?
I was going to say "ally."
Mr. Robinson?
I' m sorry.
Miss Markham told me to give this to you.
She wanted me to hand it to you directly.
She sounded very mysterious.
What is it?
The police report on Agustin' s death.
Who' s winning?
Would you get me another drink, please?
This is for VlPs only.
How did you get in here?
The security guard was female.
She was susceptible to my charm.
- Big fan, huh?
- He' s going to foul.
Yeah.
This fax.
One could draw some startling conclusions.
- The forward centre is a star.
- The police reports Agustin' s suicide...
- at five minutes to 1 1: 00 in the morning...
- You' re ruining my game.... after McGovern and I spoke.
McGovern knew about this.
Our boss is involved in this.
Agustin never stood a chance.
- I' m glad you' re in this with me.
- No, you can count me out.
- These guys, they don' t blush at much.
- You scared?
If you were going to sit it out, why did you bait me?
You were hungry, out to get a name.
Here' s a story, now go fetch it.
So, I get my head blown off, and you sit behind your desk?
Hank, when you' ve seen what I' ve seen, and you' ve lived what I' ve lived... then you can judge me.
If I can help without exposing myself, I will.
But I don' t intend on destroying myself over this.
It' s not big enough.
See you at the water cooler, Nicola.
Hello, Mr. Robinson.
lmagine running into you here.
Relax.
Perhaps we --
Yeah, but the only problem was he didn' t understand a word I was saying.
- Quite -- - So, what' s the joke?
- Hank, good to see you.
- Nice to see you.
Tell us what our star reporter has been up to.
What have I been up to?
Well, I was shot, chased, nearly killed.
All in a day' s work, you know.
How about you?
Murder any competitors lately?
Hank, why don' t I get you a drink?
Enjoy yourselves.
You' ve been reading too many spy novels, Hank.
How did you know what was in Agustin' s police report before it was issued?
I have an amazingly good contact in the Barcelona police force.
- Who?
- Hank!
A good reporter never reveals his sources.
- You' re lying.
- Am I?
Truth is in the eye of the beholder.
There is only one absolute truth:
Truth is power.
The anarchist attack on Nova.
Orchestrated to remove an obstacle... that stubborn old fool, Sert... and put Manuel Pla in charge.
- Framing Agustin?
- Another obstacle removed.
Now, Pla has his finger in the Internet and telecommunications pie.
Why are you doing this?
The Internet is dangerous.
It allows people to get information they cannot be trusted with.
It must be controlled... step by step.
Until, eventually, people like you are running the whole show.
I' m wondering what the Chief Magistrate is going to think about this.
Why don' t we ask him?
He' s one of my guests.
He' s right down there, see?
I believe you' ve already made his acquaintance.
Of course, we will have to tell him the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth... including your pilfering of the Aribau story.
Oh, yes, I knew all along.
That' s why I hired you.
Well, we' re the same, you and I.
Unbound by petty moral concepts of good and evil... we see what has to be done, and we do it.
- Men like us rule the world.
- No.
Yes.
We are governed only by our desires.
Me, it' s power.
For you, I' d say respect.
Look, the crime is not stealing the story, son.
The crime is getting caught.
So, why don' t we join the party?
There are some people I' d really like you to meet.
They, too, have done what it takes.
Manuel Pla:
Triumph over Adversity.
I' m a whore.
- Mr. Robinson, you have a call on Line 1.
- Thank you.
- Robinson.
- It' s me.
We cleaned up the tracking.
It' s horrible.
Play it.
Stop it!
It' s enough!
What?
Did you have to make such a scene?
Aribau filmed the whole thing, right?
Nobody will suspect me.
He saw what we wanted him to see.
Oh, Jesus.
These people are savages.
We have to broadcast this, Hank.
All right, don' t do anything yet.
Just give me a little time, all right?
Okay.
Important call?
Don' t you knock?
So what' s the plan?
The plan?
Well, I thought I' d finish my puff piece on Manuel Pla... go down to the local watering hole, get shit- faced, and try and get laid.
Yesterday, you were going to change the world.
- Well, I thought better that.
- So you' re going to do nothing?
You' re the one that wanted to leave it alone.
So it' s people like you and me that help McGovern get away with murder.
Listen to Hank, Jr.!
You and your daddy are cut from the same cloth.
- Let' s leave my father out of it.
- No, I don' t think so.
It must have been tough growing up in the great man' s shadow.
But let me cut him down to size for you.
You know his great book:
Howard Robinson covers the Islamic revolution... that topples the Shah of Iran.
He backs it up with eyewitness accounts of atrocities and mass murders.
Truth is, he spent most of his days in the Tehran Hilton, shagging me.
Bullshit.
His stories were ripped off from local Persian journalists... most of whom, I might add, did not survive the Ayatollah' s purges.
No witness, no one to expose him.
What, nothing to say?
Hank, look on the bright side.
He would' ve been so proud of you.
No, with all due respect, I think you' re wrong.
No, you should lead with this, then pick this up later.
- It is much stronger, believe me.
- Yes, okay.
Our report on Señor Pla.
- Fair and balanced, I hope.
- Just like you asked for.
Good lad.
You know, Nicola, I think our Hank is beginning to tire of Barcelona.
Perhaps we should find a more interesting spot for him.
Baghdad, say, or Kabul?
- I' m so sorry, Archie.
Really.
- I' m such a klutz!
- It' s all right.
- No problem.
- Sorry.
- Thank you very much.
- You' re welcome.
You two need a coffee break.
Now.
Just wanted to let you know that we' re going to do a story on you.
One I think you' il be rather pleased with.
Well, let me see.
"Computer genius..." and Internet pioneer. "
Wait.
"Legendary entrepreneur."
When we are finished, the whole world will want to get into bed with you.
The sky is the limit.
Robinson is a good dog.
He' il fetch and do as he' s told.
Besides, it would be rather unfortunate to have to... put down another journalist.
Nicola!
My turn to run into you.
Any special plans tonight?
Those are top secret.
- Is it Chanel you' re wearing?
- Archie!
- Who' s the lucky man?
- I' il never tell.
Do I know him?
You' il never get away with this, you know.
Dating fellow employees is against company regulations.
Okay, I' il quit.
- Look, let me give you a ride.
- No, thanks, Archie.
- You' re not going my way.
Bye.
- Goodbye.
I' m so sorry, Archie.
Nicola, you sneaky little devil.
Nicola!
- I had the story in my hands.
- All right.
I loved your father.
I' il nail them to a wall.
I swear to you.
What are you waiting for?
Impress me.
Brechner.
Listen, they killed her, okay?
Nicola.
They killed Nicola.
Meet me at 7tv, all right?
We end this now.
Robinson!
- Hank, what happened?
- Don' t ask.
- Listen, is the tape set?
- Yes, we can broadcast...
- from the studio right now.
- Okay.
Brechner.
Go round back.
Make sure the rats don' t escape.
I' m calling the cops.
- Hello.
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Brechner.
- No, no, no.
Call me Crusader.
Yeah, that' s it.
- He' s on his cell phone.
- Keep him talking.
If I can find his frequency, we can broadcast it from the studio.
All right?
- I' m afraid not, pal.
You' re not working out as we had hoped.
Your resignation is required.
- I even convinced McGovern to recruit you.
- I' ve got his frequency.
I followed you for a week after the Nova incident.
You never showed any sign of remorse, not once.
I said, "This is our guy!"
I even cleaned up after you.
Remember Joaquim?
A few drops of hydrochloric acid in a glass of beer... problem solved, if you know what I mean.
- Nicola?
- An injection.
Straight to the aorta.
Melts away the protective cardiac tissue.
Looks just like a heart attack, don' t you think?
Very clean.
Hey, that' s my set.
Hank, I had help.
You helped me.
They are all dead because of you.
You endangered their lives just so you could get one step closer.
To what, Hank?
The top?
Greed.
So ugly, isn' t it, Hank?
I may have done the deed, but you sure made it easy.
- Listen to me, you son of a bitch!
- Now, now, now, Hank!
You should be thanking me.
You' re not dead.
I' ve allowed you to.
- Why don' t you go to hell?
- Maybe I will.
But after you, my friend.
And Hank, when you get there... say hi to Carlos Aribau.
Hello.
I don' t think so.
You know, this is the second time I' ve had to hold a gun to your head.
You remember.
I think I' ve let you live long enough.
God damn it!
This is so sweet.
Interpol.
Everything is all right.
What?
Good thing your friend Pedro called the police... when he saw your impromptu broadcast.
We' ve been tracking these two for months.
So he was using your identity as a cover, and you' ve been...
- following me to get to him.
- Well, I' m sorry.
- Excuse me.
I got to go.
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?
I' ve been better.
I' m sorry.
The tape will destroy Pla.
It' s finally over.
Not quite.
Did you have to make such a scene?
Aribau filmed the whole thing, right?
Nobody will suspect me.
He saw what we wanted him to see.
The evidence of the released videotape led to the immediate arrest of Manuel Pla.
The damning video was shot by... journalist Carlos Aribau and his cameraman.
I stole it.
I apologise to them... and to you.
As journalists, we have all taken a sacred oath... to report nothing but the truth.
But sometimes... in the mad race for glory and ratings... we forget our promise.
It' s then your duty to remind us... to keep us vigilant, to keep us honest... to keep us fair.
Because in the end... you get the press you deserve.
This is Hank Robinson for Vision TV... signing off.
What are you all staring at?
Get back to work!
What the hell do you think you' ve done?
By ruining me, you' ve only achieved your own destruction, son.
I' m not your son, I have a father, you piece of shit.
- Don' t -- - Temper, McGovern.
You don' t want us to add assault to the other charges.
Not that it would make much difference.
- Take care, Mr. Robinson.
- Thank you.
Hey, Marisa.
What was it?
"Believe nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see."
Words to the wise.
That' s for you.
Thank you.
- Mr. Robinson.
- Yeah?
Can I get my old job back?
I' il think about it.
We have seen a star in the east.
It told us the Son of God is born.
Nativity Play/ Sermon/ Dinner
The Lord Jesus was laid in a manger...... to bring salvation to the souls of those...... with no place of their own.
Nothing is harder than to have no place...... but many are those without one.
Tell me about it!
In their solitude, they long for someone who will say:
"I want you to be here."
Not me, thanks.
Be quiet!
Jesus was born to offer those alone a place in which to be alive!
"Joy to the world, the food has come."
It' s "the Lord has come"!
You don' t know much, do you?
More than some faggot.
I am a mistake made by God.
In my heart, I am a woman.
Women can have children.
What if a miracle like the Virgin Mary getting pregnant...... was to happen to a homo?
Better give me a little extra.
After all, I' m eating for two.
Serves you right!
Miyuki!
Time to eat!
Miyuki!
Close your legs!
Act like you were a woman.
I am a woman.
And it' s a waste to spill food like that.
Don' t just gobble your bread.
Eat it with love for the people who made and brought it here.
I hate that Bible- thumping.
You' re just like Akiko.
Who' s Akiko?
My old lady.
Well!
Don' t call your mother that.
Eat shit, you old fart.
"Shit" I' il take, but "fart" I won' t!
That hurts!
You old...... "bag lady."
You peep pretty loud for a chick that can' t even find its own worms.
Should a burden on society like you be talking?
You' re a burden on us.
What does that make you?
The kettle the pot' s calling black!
You mouthy brat!
Can' t you at least get along at Christmas?
Oh, yes....
Miyuki, I got you a present.
They' re gone!
A whole set of "World Literature for Children."
Why would I need that?!
Hana looked hard for those!
Even a homeless teenage runaway needs a Christmas present!
I choose not to go home.
Six months on the street means you don' t have a home.
I can go home any time I want to.
It' s the ones who say that who never do.
Speak for yourself, you old geezer!
What are you doing to Dostoevsky?!
I won' t take that, today of all days!
Not even my father ever hit me!
So I' il do it for him!
Grow up, will you?!
Don' t hurt yourselves.
Show more respect, kid!
I' m not a kid!
With little tits like these?
You filthy old pervert!
That' s harassment!
Will you two stop!
Huh?
It' s been...... abandoned.
There, there, there.
Care for this child.
What a world!
Oh, my!
You' re a little girl.
I wonder what your name is.
"John Doe."
She' s a girl, I said!
He' s so rude!
How old was I when I started living like this?
Thirty- something?
I still thought that I was better off...... than a child with no home.
There, there, now!
We' il take you somewhere warm.
The cop shop' s that way!
This is a Christmas present from God!
She' s our baby!
Huh?

Sorry!
What do you mean, take her with us?
I' m just doing God' s will.
Her parents might come back.
What parent would leave a child out in this cold?!
That' s a devil, not a parent!
Kiyoko wanted us to find her.
"Kiyoko"?
"Kiyoko"?
Why "Kiyoko"?!
From kiyo, "pure," on this purest of nights.
How tacky!
Kiyoko' s a fine name!
Did you have a girlfriend named that?
Idiot!
Look, we can' t just name her!
She' s not a puppy or a kitten!
So I' m taking her home.
To a cardboard box?
There' s no room!
This is a once- in- a- lifetime chance!
Let me feel like a mother!
A haiku:
"A little baby / powdery snow on its cheeks / on this holy night."
Directed by Satoshi Kon
Peek- a- boo!
Oh, dear!
Tell me what' s wrong!
Shut up!
I know, I know, he' s not your mommy.
He' s just a homeless homo.
Don' t say that in front of her!
A baby crying around here will sound weird!
We' re going to take you to the police soon, okay?
You' re not going anywhere, are you?
Idiot!
We' re taking her to the police!
Don' t shout or she' il never shut up!
Why won' t you stop crying?
Are you hungry?
There, there!
Maybe she' s sick.
Tomorrow....
I promise I' il take her then.
Christmas should be the happiest day of the year.
If we take her in now, it' il always be the worst day of her life!
Maybe...... she needs a diaper.
Hana, boil some water.
I' il make some milk.
Whose side are you on?!
Go buy some water!
My angel isn' t drinking from the tap!
Why me?
Where does a bum get off telling me "Them that works eats"?
Just for tonight, remember.
Tomorrow we take her to the police.
So "no man is an island" after all, huh?
You' re buying water?!
A Christmas miracle.
What a haul!
Watch where you' re going, brat!
You watch where you' re going!
I was married once.
With a child?
No, don' t tell me!
I don' t want to hear this!
You never forget for one second.
A child' s the only thing you hold dearer than life itself.
No.
Bullshit!
Give it back!
Hey, you' re the girl who hangs out with Gin.
Get out of here, will you?
We don' t want Gin after us.
Why not?
You' re the light of his life, that' s why not!
There' s not much light in a cardboard box.
Let me have this book.
How old?
Twenty- one, I think.
Five or six years older than Miyuki, I guess.
That old?
If she was alive.
When I was 20 I got a girl pregnant, and we got married.
I was in heaven.
You could have poked me in the eye and I' d have just smiled at you.
But my daughter got sick, and the medical bills were huge.
I was something of a bicycle racer then.
There was this race....
You threw it?
A punk I knew had this scheme.
They found out, I got kicked out of racing, and my girl died.
I just didn' t feel like working anymore.
And then my wife followed my daughter.
Oh, no!
That' s how you get to be a man like me.
I didn' t want to hear that!
I hate sad stories!
It' s freezing!
You' re used to this.
Kind of.
I' il give her the milk.
Dreams do come true.
I always dreamed of being the mother of a little girl.
A nice, warm house, a pretty daughter.
Even if my husband was no good...... I would accept dire poverty as long as I had my child.
Feed the poor kid!
You' re so pretty.
The prettiest little girl in the world.
What do you want?!
They' re gone.
Santa Claus, maybe?
"Uncle Bag" and the baby are gone.
What' s that faggot thinking about?!
Man, he' s got big feet!
You can' t have feet fixed.
Are you taking her back?
There' s probably an APB out on her.
And for you.
I doubt it.
An arrest warrant, maybe.
Her parents are probably sorry about this now.
So let' s take her to the police.
A baby' s always better off with its real mother.
Not necessarily.
Sometimes a foster mother' s better.
- What?!
- Don' t be stupid.
I never knew my real mother.
But I' il bet if she saw me now, she' d flip.
How can someone homeless raise a child?
I know, I know!
I don' t want her shunted from one foster home to another...... without even one memory...... of ever having been loved.
You don' t have to be a foundling to feel that.
They must have had reasons.
Nothing should make you abandon a child!
That means you' ve taken love and tossed it away, like trash.
Yeah, but what can we do about it?
Find her mother.
And ask why she abandoned her baby.
If she can make me understand...... I' il forgive her, and my mother too.
Find her?
How?
We' il have to pay again.
This is an expensive year- end!
What if we find another baby?
They don' t toss them out in twos.
Another key!
Look at these panties.
You' d catch cold in them!
Are they the ones?
Are these your folks?
Look, business cards.
A hostess club won' t be open at this hour!
We' ve got some walking to do.
You' ve gotta be kidding!
He was eating for two!
But why pack like you' re off on a trip and then abandon a baby?
Maybe it was one last trip they were taking.
A family suicide?!
Then what do we do?
We can' t search the next world!
Shh!
We apologize for any inconvenience.
Trains will be delayed due to heavy snowfall.
It' s so hot in here!
What a stink!
Have you bathed lately?
Or washed my clothes.
How embarrassing!
Oh, dear!
There, there.
Did she piss herself?
That' s why it stinks!
Quiet!
Shut that kid up!
Watch it!
Hey!
Miyuki!
What' s she up to?
We wasted our train fares!
It was me who paid them.
I' m sorry!
There' s no more milk.
Go ahead, blame it all on me.
Oh, cheer up!
Let' s sing a song.
What' s that?
The Sound of Music, of course.
Never heard of it.
That' s going to make you even hungrier.
I' m starving!
I told you!
Look after my little angel.
Go on without me.
Just say you' il never forget the queer you once knew.
Look.
A cemetery.
I' m not dead yet!
Now I' m alive again!
But there' s nothing for a baby in these offerings to the dead!
We' il get by!
Yeah, sure!
"We' il get by!"
People keep on saying that till they end up living like us!
And while we keep on saying it, the kid' il end up under a stone here.
"Kiyoko"!
She has a name!
Yeah, whatever.
And she' s cute.
She' s so pretty.
But listen to me.
I' m serious.
You listening?
If you really care about that kid...... you' il find her someone to take care of her.
I speak from experience.
That' s what her parents said, I bet.
What do you mean?
I wouldn' t abandon a kid.
Don' t be stupid!
Your family abandoned you!
There you go again!
Am I going to sit and listen...... while some dumb faggot pisses on me?
What are we doing here?
Tell me.
Wracking our brains!
We' re scavenging offerings left in a cemetery.
And why?
Because we' re homeless.
- No!
I' m not going to stop.
We are three good- for- nothing bums...... who can' t even look after ourselves.
Shut up!
I' m thinking!
I won' t shut up.
You can' t get milk from an old queer' s tits, no matter how hard you think.
Come on, Hana!
You know we can' t do this.
Speak for yourself!
This way the whole family will be dead.
Oh, my!
You' re so lucky, Kiyoko!
God must really love you!
Then why was she...... dumped?
Left!
- That' s a dead end!
- It' s right!
- Tails.
- Heads.
What' s this guy doing parking like that?
Doesn' t he know what a "public thoroughfare" is?
How did that happen?
Bad luck.
The car got stuck, and I forgot the parking brake.
Then someone shouted, "Dorothy, wait!"...... and then I heard, "Whoops!"...... and the damn car rolled on top of me.
I don' t bring my men with me when I' m visiting the old man' s grave.
I owe you.
Call me if you' re ever in trouble.
Oh, no, we never have any trouble.
You' re from Kinshicho?
We were just going there.
I know it' s rude to ask....
If it' s rude, then don' t ask.
Come on.
Would you know this establishment?
"Midori"
Know it?
Its owner' s marrying my daughter today.
He' s one of my men, but he' s too cocky.
I was against it.
But your daughter chose him.
The daughter I brought up, married to a man like that....
Know what I mean?
But if your daughter' s happy with him...... isn' t that the main thing?
You' re right!
I went to the old man' s grave so I wouldn' t cry at the wedding.
Watch the road!
Good evening, sir!
Make yourselves at home.
Daddy, you' re late!
Sorry, sorry.
I almost got killed.
I owe them my life.
My daughter, Kiyoko.
Hello.
What have you gotten us into?!
Just shut up and eat!
Diaper change.
Your turn, Miyuki.
Don' t you think Kiyoko has amazing luck?
Yeah.
Maybe she does.
Her name' s Sachiko.
Not "Midori"?
Just at the club.
She' s Sachiko, "happy child," though she didn' t look it.
But some plastic surgery turned her into a good little earner.
She quit.
Said she was pregnant.
Do you know where she is?
I doubt you' il wring any money out of her.
No, I have something to give her.
I' m sorry I spilled your food.
You remember her?
Midori, the skinny broad.
She said her husband was in debt.
What' s wrong with you?
That bastard.
Do you know him?
Then she borrowed more money from us...... and ended up screwed both ways.
You know where she is?
If it weren' t for his damn get- rich- quick scheme...
If it weren' t for his damn get- rich- quick scheme...... I' d still be with my wife and kid!
But aren' t they both dead?
I' il kill the bastard!
You' il get killed!
Mitsuo!
Mitsuo!
It was that maid!
Are you okay?!
She' s got a gun!
Hey, what --?!
Kiyoko!
Miyuki!
Hey!
Thank you very much.
She' s got a gun, you know!
- Our lives are already wasted!
- Hana!
There!
One of your cabs picked up a young woman with a baby.
Number 1 2- 25.
My name is --
Wait a minute.
We' re homeless bums, not action- movie heroes.
What we need now is the police.
If you like the police so much, get them to adopt you!
Those children are like family!
I thought I could depend on you!
Don' t talk like you were my damn wife.
I' m not going anywhere.
Gin!
We' ve done all we could.
You' re giving up?
There' s nothing we can do.
You are really the lowest of the low!
The best thing you' il ever do is die in the gutter!
Oh, poor you!
You' il be dead and no one' il care!
All you ever do is cause people trouble!
Dead or alive, you' re living trash!
The king of trash!
Okay, so I' m trash.
But you' re ugly.
- Yes?
- I want to get rid of some trash.
I don' t think I' d fit.
Yeah, that' s what I am, living trash!
Who cares if you die in the gutter?
You' re dead all the same.
You okay?
Hang in there, Gramps.
- May I make one last request?
- What?
Give me a drink of that.
You' re not selling me into slavery!
Somebody, help!
I always wanted to die drunk, in a nice old house.
Now I' m halfway there.
Fate works in strange ways.
I' ve lived a long time...... but I' m just trash, as worthless dead as alive.
Don' t talk like that!
You remind me of myself when I was younger.
Looking at you now...... may I make a last request?
Get rid of this for me.
Some people will be hurt if it' s known who I am.
I understand.
No one will ever know.
Take care of yourself, okay?
May I make a last...?
Request?
And now, goodbye.
That' s it!
Thanks, Gramps!
Time for the New Year' s clean- up!
Cool!
Husband?
Father --
Police.
Your dad' s a cop?!
My father was a policeman!
Father, policeman?
Except I' m the one he' s going to be arresting.
Hold it.
How' ve you been?
Now?
Just cleaning up.
Hey, wake up!
Come on!
No!
Not that!
Time to die, old man!
Kiyo' s coming?
I' m there!
The girls are drinking near here.
Yeah?
All cleaned up.
Give it back!
Give me that back!
Her foreigner husband looked like he was in a real bad mood.
Did he hit her?
No, she was being real nice for a girl so young.
My wife could learn something!
His foreign assailant fled, taking a young woman and a baby hostage.
With the groom in serious condition, police speculate this may be a war...... between crime syndicates.
Hey, this is serious!
I' m not kidding around, either!
My mom' s religious.
She chants all the time.
Me.
Isn' t she cute?
I found her.
Those spots on her back look like wings.
So I called her "Angel."
But she' s gone.
Father.
I stabbed my father.
I can never go back.
The baby?
A gift from God.
Yes.
Give me a break!
I' ve got a family at home!
Those children are my family!
They went in there.
Hey!
The fare!
I' il be right back.
Miyuki!
Kiyoko!
Miyuki!
Kiyoko!
Where are you?
Kiyoko!
Miyuki!
How could you do this to me?!
It' s your own fault!
You never listen to anything I say!
Use the scarf I made you...... to mop up the blood!
What have you done with Angel?!
Where is she?
Where is my Angel?
She' s right here.
Our angel.
I' m hungry.
Make me some food.
Why?
What are you doing in my house?
Miyuki, take Kiyoko.
I' il get dinner.
Kiyoko!
Miyuki!
Uncle Bag?!
Oh, I' ve missed you, my little angel!
I wish I was her mother, but I' m just another homo.
Miyuki...... I' m so glad you' re safe.
Where' s the geezer?
He could be dead for all I care!
I' m dying.
Maybe he went home.
Who cares?
All he thinks about is himself.
Yeah, Miss Hana, but you' re in love with him, aren' t you?
Don' t be silly!
I like my men to be more "manly."
The kind of man I like is slender, middle- aged, tanned...... with a divine square- back haircut and a lower- town accent...... who says, "Ah, what the hell"...... when I don' t quite have the cab fare.
So, what now, Miss Hana?
Why are you calling me that?
"Uncle Bag" is fine.
It' s hard to say.
I' m glad.
He just died there?
He was homeless.
I might be next.
Just do your job.
Gin!
Gin!
Gin!
Take it easy.
Gin!
Calm down!
Where is that man of mine?!
Kiyo....
If only tonight...... I wanted to see you before I died.
Kiyoko!
What is your desire?
My magic, or an ambulance?
- An ambulance.
- Well!
Aren' t you rude!
What are we going to do?
Kiyoko can' t sleep out on the street!
The geezer' s not here, we' re freezing, sleepy, hungry.
This sucks!
I guess there' s no choice.
I never thought I' d be here again.
I' m sorry.
We' re closed for a private party tonight --
Hana?!
I know I have no right to come strolling in now...... but there' s no one else I can call on, "Mother"!
Hana!
Mother!
Hana!
Geezer?!
What happened, Gin?!
Some kids beat me up.
I guess I' m just not an action hero.
He said he knew you.
But he said he was homeless, you know.
So am I.
What?
But why?!
Since Ken died I' m like a canary...... that' s forgotten its song.
You sing all the time!
Isn' t she cute?!
I wish I could have one!
So Ken died, did he?
AlDS?
He slipped on the soap.
Well, death is always a hair' s breadth away.
But if you were in trouble, why didn' t you come back?
We certainly had fun here, didn' t we?
My old memories
People call me notorious
Aw, you' re ugly!
Good for nothing
Get off!
Good for nothing
What a terrible thing to say
Eat shit, you old fart!
"Shit" I' il take, but "fart" I won' t!
I couldn' t come back after I' d done that.
A little bit of money took care of that.
I' m just happy you' re all right.
Stop it!
You scare me when you start crying.
What about that baby?
Is the girl its mother?
Well....
Where is your mother, anyway?
Abandoned?!
I' ve been abandoned!
Them' s the breaks, I guess.
I could see me in her.
Born on the street, and back there again.
That' s why I want to find her a home full of love!
All I ever wanted was love!
Ow!
What the hell?!
The geezer' s come out.
Where are my clothes?!
Way to go, Gin!
Come back any time.
Thank you, Mother.
My mother' s white breath / as she watches me set out / on a long journey.
Oh, man!
An empty building' s always nice, but look who got here first.
I' d just love to fill up on some meat!
Don' t you dare!
Just kidding!
The snow' s let up.
Miyuki, will you go shopping?
Okay.
Get me some sake.
Just one.
- No!
- I wish.
"Honey, I' m home."
You stayed in there?
You' d think you were homeless!
Actually, we' re looking for these people.
Sachiko Nishizawa.
Do you know her?
She never paid me back for her Neighborhood Association dues.
Are you a relative?
We' re acquaintances of a relative.
Her husband was no better.
Gambling day and night, and mean when he drank.
Living on his wife' s earnings and borrowed money.
Where are they now?
I wouldn' t know.
Mrs. Kurumizawa might.
They left about three months ago.
The house was seized for debt.
One night they just up and went.
They were a nice couple at first...... but it wasn' t long before they started fighting.
That' s poverty for you.
All that debt didn' t stop him from lording it over her.
Even the most dedicated wife has her limits.
You' d see bruises sometimes.
The poor woman.
Not on her, on him!
Oh, dear!
But his mother would always take his side against her.
His parents built them this house.
Where do they live?
Mrs. Yamanouchi might know.
Her mother- in- law was always complaining...... that she never did any housework.
But her son was perfect, of course.
That' s why I told her...... she' d never see a grandchild with his wife working in a club.
But she did get pregnant.
They can always find time...... to do what they must!
Shinkocho 1 - 2- 25 Maison Happiness Apt.
What if they ran out from this new place too?
What a horrible man!
Poor Sachiko!
Working to pay off her husband' s gambling debts!
Right!
But I never thought of abandoning the kid!
- Huh?
- Nothing.
That' s no reason to just dump the kid!
I' ve said that all along.
Miyuki:
Angel has come home.
Dad.
Doesn' t it ever get tired of snowing?
Thank you.
I wonder how we look to them.
Like a bum, a homo, a runaway and a foundling.
Kiyoko is God' s messenger.
We' re her servants.
Unpaid servants.
Paying for a father' s sins.
Yeah, if her father had been any good at all...... we wouldn' t be going through all this.
Even a good- for- nothing father never forgets a child.
I' m going out.
What' s the matter with her?
A child never forgets its parents.
I never stop wanting...... to see my daughter, just once.
So she' s alive?
Yeah.
And your wife?
I' m sure she' s remarried...... and living happily.
"Hello.
It' s me, Miyuki. "
Why did you split up?
- Drinking and gambling.
- What?!
Just like....
I' m a louse.
But I' ve always wanted to do something for her as a father...... even just a little.
Now I' ve had to sweat blood just to save 30, 000 yen.
That' s great, Gin!
We can stuff ourselves!
Stuff you!
Ishida speaking.
Miyuki?
Is that you?
Are you all right?
I' m sorry!
I' m sorry!
I' m sorry!
Excuse me, but if you wouldn' t mind....
"Get out," you mean?
Other customers might like to sit down.
There' s hardly anyone here!
You guys stink!
Homeless or something?
Who are you looking at?
Hold it, you!
It' s New Year' s Sale time at The Food Store!
Come to The Food Store for all your special New Year' s needs!
See in the New Year with your family!
Call an ambulance, quick.
Right!
I knew it!
Kiyoko really is the messenger of God!
Hey!
Miss Hana!
Hana!
Following a recent gangland shooting incident...... police are seeking a fugitive thought to be Latin American.
Mitsuo Hiruta, shot three times...... in protecting the leader of his syndicate...... will be questioned after he recovers from his wounds.
Isn' t she cute!
When was she born?
Not long ago, I guess.
So the mother....
I' m not.
What' s her name?
Kiyoko.
That' s my name too.
What a coincidence.
Your friend is very weak.
Make sure he gets rest and proper nutrition.
Doctor!
Believe it or not, we' re homeless.
I' m just a doctor.
Rest and nutrition don' t fit with our lifestyle, you realize.
I can try to cure disease.
Lifestyle is something you have to fix.
All anyone can do is their best.
Take care.
The bill for today is 29, 830 yen.
Bring your health- insurance card and you' il get a refund.
I' m sorry, Gin!
Stop crying!
You' il get the bills all wet.
That' s 30, 000 yen.
Kiyoko?!
Dad?
So you took up nursing.
I see.
I' m glad you' re well.
Oh, yeah, I' m just great.
How' s your mother?
Fine.
Yeah?
That' s good.
What are you doing now?
I' m in recycling.
I had to drop something off here.
You must hate me.
I was never any kind of a father to you.
But that 30, 000 yen was money I' d saved up for you.
You may not believe it.
I always wanted to see you.
When I was little, Mom and I searched for you.
We even checked unidentified corpses.
After you disappeared, Mom ran the store herself.
The store?
It was hard for a woman to run a bicycle shop alone.
That' s not quite the same as a bicycle racer.
The man you owed money to was shot and wounded the other day, you know.
He lived?!
That' s a relief.
I thought you' d say that.
I ran up the debts, not him.
Thank that doctor for me.
He seems like a nice guy.
I' m getting married.
Oh?
That' s good.
To him.
Great!
But isn' t he about my age?
He' s been married.
His daughter got sick and died...... and his wife followed her.
That man makes me so mad!
Aren' t you moved?
Here' s the address and phone number.
Yours?
The old house is gone.
Even if you can' t now, call me sometime.
Kiyoko!
I' ve had about all I can stand!
Miss Hana?
Telling us you were a racer!
I was always at the track.
Yeah, betting!
And your debts snowballed so you couldn' t face your family...... and you ran and hid in a cardboard box!
Yes, damn it!
That' s what your father is!
He can' t bet, he' s spineless, his feet stink and he can' t drink!
He kills off his wife and daughter to buy sympathy!
He said you had an incurable disease!
With a father like that, you have my sympathy!
Is this how you repay me?!
Repay you?!
Am I hearing right?
If we' re talking about debt, I' m waiting for my change!
Debt' s a concept you don' t even understand!
You understand how to troll through garbage cans!
Though you' re not too good at raising them, are you?
And your debts you shove off on your wife.
Always running away, never doing anything right!
Running away' s the only racing you ever did!
Miyuki!
We' re leaving!
Miss Hana?
I guess he' s better.
Should you have said that in front of her?
If she' s his daughter, she' il forgive him.
Being able to speak freely...... is the lifeblood of love.
Maybe I' m na: i: ve.
So you' re in love with him?
Don' t be silly.
I' m the Weeping Red Devil.
What?
It' s a story I love.
There was a red devil who wanted to be friends with people.
But since he was a devil, no one would go near him.
So his friend the blue devil made a plan.
He' d wreak havoc among the people, and the red devil would save them.
When you try to achieve something, someone' s bound to get hurt.
You always have to sacrifice something.
But the blue devil had to go away so they' d never know it was a trick.
It' s a sad story.
But that means you leave.
Where will you go?
It' s best for everyone when they' re with their family.
Soon we' il find Kiyoko' s mother.
And then what?
You don' t have a real family!
Rare "Line Of Ones" Wins Lottery
Top prize in the 200- million- yen lottery is a very rare number.
Group 1 1, number 1 1 1, 1 1 1...... is worth 50 million yen.
A different group pays 1 00, 000 yen.
To repeat, the winning prize number is....
This just in.
Police have released a sketch of an infant taken...... from a hospital in Tokyo' s Shinagawa Ward.
We' ve come all the way here, but we don' t have her address!
The geezer' s got it!
Let' s go back.
Where are you going?
- What?
You hated that idea!
I was just ego- tripping.
Now I want to apologize to her parents.
They might not be able to sleep waiting for news about her.
That' s what we said from the very start!
They might even be about to commit suicide!
I' ve done something that can' t be taken back!
I' il throw myself in this river.
I' il step neatly out of my shoes, stand on the handrail, and be at peace.
But then I' il see a baby' s face on the water.
While I see this child' s face, I cannot die!
Hey, you!
No!
You' re too young for this!
Let me die!
You!
Sachiko Nishizawa.
What were you thinking of?!
Is that an apology?
If we hadn' t found this child, she would' ve frozen to death!
It wasn' t me!
My husband took her away when I wasn' t there!
I' ve looked and looked!
Is that true?
All I' ve suffered on account of that man!
"Hi, Mom!"
God really loves this child, you know.
I want you to give her lots of love too.
Do right by her, or you' il pay for it.
I' m so sorry!
I' m sorry!
Mrs. Nishizawa!
What are you doing in here?!
Get out of here!
Get out!
I' m no thief.
You' re lying!
Get out!
Where' s the baby?!
Did an old queer and a girl come to give it back?
What are you talking about?!
You abandoned a baby!
I can prove it.
Are you a cop?
I' m just a bum who was passing by.
Are you right in the head?
I' m damn near crazy from all this!
Why is the baby you abandoned on the news as being "taken away"?
They' il call us kidnappers!
It wasn' t me.
That' s not my kid.
What?
There, there!
Don' t cry!
Take care.
Raise her right.
See you again someday.
Never leave her again.
On the year' s last day / when all of a life' s accounts / have been settled up.
Sachiko stole that baby out of the hospital.
She stole a baby and then abandoned it?!
That' s a person' s life!
She lied to me about it!
And now it' s gone way out of control.
I don' t want anything to do with it!
Take the kid to the police!
What?!
Don' t act like you' re not part of this!
You don' t want to get involved?
You' re her husband!
That' s all over!
I' m getting my life back together.
Look!
I won 1 00, 000 yen in the lottery.
My luck' s turned!
I know a guy just like you.
He threw away his life and his family.
They threw him away.
I' m no loser!
These were in your wife' s bag.
Any idea where she might have gone?
She said she was going to be with her baby.
She was going to kill herself!
There' s no time to waste!
She was just going to go look for the kid.
She' s desperate.
That only means one thing!
But where do I look?!
Hana!
Miyuki!
Kiyoko!
God must be busy at this time of year.
Better once a year than never.
Geezer?
You' re too late.
You just missed a very moving finale.
What' s the matter?
"Kiyoko"!
"Stomach"?
"Mother"!
Now that' s settled...... what the hell do you mean?!
Fake!
The mother!
Sachiko' s a fake!
Pardon?
Why won' t you drink?
A baby has to drink from its mother' s breast.
We' il never be close if you don' t!
Wrong people.
She can' t be far!
But where do we look?
We can' t just give her up now!
That' s Kiyoko!
Should you be running?
If I don' t run now, when will I?
This way!
Returning stolen goods to a thief!
How could we be so dumb?!
Who said "family suicide"?
You did!
- Which way?
- Left.
- Okay, right!
- Why?
You' re a lousy gambler!
You got that right.
Somebody help!
Hey!
Wait!
Thief!
Thief!
What' s wrong?
A woman just stole my truck!
Hey!
Thief!
That woman!
She' s a baby thief!
Be quiet, will you?
Be a good baby!
Stop!
Give Kiyoko back!
Give me a break!
I' m forever in your debt!
Gin!
That woman' s crazy!
Get closer!
I can' t!
You have to, for Kiyoko!
- Who' s Kiyoko?!
- Step on it like a man!
Okay!
Be quiet!
- Gin!
- Geezer?!
Geezer!
Go for it, Gin!
No action star can touch you!
Pass her!
We' il die!
Step on it!
Okay!
Stop crying!
Don' t be afraid.
I' il never leave you again.
You want to die?!
Gin!
Gin!
There!
- Are you okay?!
- Where' s Kiyoko?
- Faster!
- Okay!
Which way?
We' re at the scene...... where a truck has crashed into a building in Shinagawa.
Now a woman holding a baby has appeared on the roof.
Witnesses say the woman is connected with the incident...... as she was driving the truck.
Now there' s someone else on the roof!
No!
Tell me why you took that baby.
I didn' t!
This baby is mine!
You' re lying!
Its real parents are worried sick about it!
That' s not true!
You of all people should know what it' s like to lose a child!
She' s dead.
My baby died before she was even born!
All the other babies looked so healthy there in the ward.
I wanted to die.
I decided she was mine.
I thought as long as I had her, everything would be fine.
My husband would mend his ways, and we' d be a real family.
That' s bullshit!
Build a family by ruining a baby' s life?
If you' re going to die, do it alone!
It' s only born once.
You, me, or Kiyoko.
Give her back, okay?
I want to be reborn.
Sachiko!
Sachiko, don' t die!
Come back to me!
I was wrong!
Please, don' t kill yourself!
We' il start again!
We' il be reborn!
Sachiko!
I' il go first and wait for you.
Sachiko!
Let me die!
Kiyoko wants to see her mom and dad!
I want to go home.
I' m sorry!
Take her...... to her mother and father.
Oh, no.
Hana!
I' m okay!
I' m still alive!
Inspector, I don' t know how to thank you.
We' re not the ones you should thank.
Man, that was a good sleep!
Get me a cigarette, Miyuki.
- In my jacket.
- Yeah, yeah.
That was some New Year' s!
It' s "No Smoking" here.
Lighten up!
I' m a hero!
You mean "we"!
I guess we won' t have to listen to Kiyoko' s damn crying anymore.
She' s not "Kiyoko" anymore.
I' m not pleased.
What can we do?
Not that.
This is a men' s ward!
Perhaps we' re intruding.
No, it' s just...... I' m told they' re homeless.
Who cares?
We' d like them to be her godfathers.
Come in.
Excuse us.
The baby' s parents would like to thank you --
Dad....
(young man) Looking at this picture, I know you might be thinkin ':
"Sure looks like a lonely place to be, way up there."
If indeed you were, I' d have to disagree.
Truth is, when you stop to ponder it, there' s really no such thing as a lonely place,..... just lonely people.
That' s what I believe.
You can be lonely any place: up on a rooftop, at a big family shindig,..... in a football stadium, with 60, 000 other humans all around,..... or even in a small town, like Shelbyville, Indiana.
Now, I' m not sayin 'there' s anything wrong with it.
In fact, loneliness is what ensures the propagation of our species.
I think that' s why most people get married.
Because they' re lonely, horny or out of money.
But mostly cos they' re just damn lonely.
Of course, that is one hell of a milk- toast reason..... to link up with one person for the rest of your existence.
But people do it every day.
They give in to their loneliness.
And the next thing they know, they' re trapped.
Perhaps I' m being too picky.
I talked to this counsellor once.
He told me that the fact I was raised in an orphanage..... has rendered me afraid of abandonment, and therefore fearful of commitment.
Now, you can tell by my tone, I don' t think much of his opinion.
I' m ready to commit, just as soon as I find that one woman I can' t live without.
That one woman that gives me goose bumps all over.
I simply refuse to settle for anything less, like most people seem to do.
Like my boss, Larry.
(whistles) Be a sport, will ya?
I missed Ruthie' s birthday dinner last night and she' s makin 'my life hell in a handbasket.
Come on now, Gilly.
Do me this.
She' il love that.
- What the hell is this?
It' s a Russian Pomeranian, Larry.
Nah, I don' t wanna put any American dogs outta work.
Come on now, Gilly.
Come on over.
Last time I...
- Thanks, buddy.
A slice of family life and home cookin 'will do your heart good.
We' il make it a wingding.
(Gilly) This is fine cuisine, Mrs P.
It' s takeout, Gilly.
From Pizza Hut.
- That' s not true, Ruthie.
You know I...
- That' s why he never comes home for dinner.
- I' m out there busting my ass.
If you' re busting your ass, how come it' s the size of a goddamn beanbag chair?
If you put out once in a while, maybe I wouldn' t be seeking carnal pleasure in food.
All right!
Call me old- fashioned,..... but I don' t think a child should be made to picture her parents humping.
- I don' t tell you about my sex life.
- You' re not having sex.
- Are you having sex?
- Cher, tell Daddy you' re kidding.
She' s kidding.
She doesn' t even have a boyfriend.
You don' t need to have a boyfriend to be having sex.
I' m just saying that a boy doesn' t have to be a friend to be nibbling my package.
Are you...?
- I think she' s saying she' s a whore, Pop.
- Buddy!
- Pervert!
I am not.
I' m just popular.
Like Gilly here.
He doesn' t have a girlfriend, but I' il bet he' s having sex.
- Well, occasionally, sure, but...
Well, ultimately I believe in waiting till one is married before...
How come you don' t have a girlfriend?
Dad says you' re confused about your sexuality.
- No, I never said that.
- Right.
Fagnostic.
- Larry!
- That' s it!
Why?
She' s just repeating what you said.
You always take her side!
You let her get her ears pierced.
- You try to stop her!
- I got my ears pierced because I like it, OK?
And I got these pierced because I hate you!
Hey, that was you on the lnternet!
I am sick of bein 'treated like dirty bath water.
I chase poodles all day so she can drive around in a brand- new Saturn.
Fully loaded!
The usual, hon.
This kinda thing makes a man wanna bludgeon his family and get drunk.
That' s pretty serious talk, Larry.
Maybe you should speak to a professional about this.
You mean a hit man?
No, man.
- Unless you did it.
- I was talkin 'about a shrink, Larry.
That' s for crazy people.
- Hey, maggots.
- Hey, Stewart.
What the hell happened to your hair?
You like it?
I just got it cut..... by the most beautiful woman on the face of God' s green earth.
- Looks pretty weird.
- Yeah, thanks.
She called it a European cut.
Says it draws attention away from my ears.
A fuckin 'chisel?
Who the hell cares?
She' s new, over at Mega Kutz.
I can' t trust the opinion of a guy who scrapes up road kill for a living.
You can trust me with this one.
Man, she got the face of an angel.
Just gives you goose bumps all over, you know?
Like it?
Who' s next?
- Uh, right here.
- Come here.
So how do you like it?
Just like it is, only not quite so long.
So you want it shorter, then?
I think shorter' s the way to go.
So you cut a lot of hair?
I guess so.
I mean, I' ve been working here a month or so, ever since I moved back.
Oh, so you' re not from...
Uh, where are you from?
Oh, I' m from here.
Beaver, Oregon.
But then I moved back because I had to help out with my daddy.
He had stroke number two and he' s paralysed now, so...
It truly is.
Well, it' s his own damn fault.
He' s so tense all the time.
It' s like he' s got fire ants runnin 'through his veins.
Oh, I' m sorry!
How' s that, um...?
I' m sorry.
What did you say your name was?
Actually, I didn' t.
It' s Gilly.
OK, Gilly.
I' m Jo.
Could you hold that there for me?
- How' s that for length?
- Beautiful.
So I see you have a cat.
Well, I had a cat.
He ran away two weeks ago and I haven' t heard from him since.
Oh, he' il be back.
You know cats.
I' ve had him since he was a pup.
Ringo?
That must be a pretty popular name for a cat these days.
It is?
I work down at the animal shelter and I just took in a cat yesterday named Ringo.
Too bad this Ringo' s missin 'a tail.
- Aargh!
- Hey, watch the corner!
She said put him in ER 4.
Gilly!
Are you OK?
Were they able to sew it back on?
No, but they tell me I' m first in line for an ear donor.
You lying sack!
What are you doin 'tonight?
Just healin ', mostly.
I' il cook you dinner and you can bring Ringo.
Listen, Jo.
-.. and you cut off my ear.
- I do owe you dinner.
Just say yes, or else I just might cut off your other ear.
Uh... 6. 30?
- Yeah, 6. 30' s great.
I' m a much better cook than I am a hairstylist.
- I just don' t know why you' re doing this.
Cookin 'dinner for this fella.
You oughta be fixin 'dinner for Jack.
The man who wants to marry you, not some dog- catcher who makes 18 grand a year..... and comes home smellin 'like cat piss every night.
- Of course I' il be polite.
Of course I' il be polite.
Jack called again today.
I talked to him for a long time.
He asked me why you left him.
I wish you would tell him, because I can' t make any sense out of it.
Are you listening to me?
- Hold on.
- Oh, would you... just put the thing down!
You listen to me now.
Good men are few and far between in this world.
When you find yourself a keeper - the way I found your sweet pop out there -.. then you grab ahold of him and you treat him the way he wants to be treated.
- (voice synthesizer) Valdine!
Valdine.
Valdine!
- What is it, gimpy?
- I want a beer, goddammit.
You hear me?
What in the name of God...?
- I was watchin 'that.
- Yeah, I bet you were.
Do you want another one?
- I want you to stay calm.
- Get me a goddamn beer.
Gilly!
Ringo!
All the dogs at the animal shelter chipped in for a little going- away present.
Well, thank them for me, and thank you.
- Just doin 'my job.
- How' s your ear?
It' s OK.
I got all the pus drained out of it.
(Jo' s father) Close the goddamn door.
You have a robot?
Daddy, I' d like you to meet Gilly Noble.
It' s a pleasure to meet you, Mr Wingfield.
He' s a little shy around strangers.
- I' m gonna get Ringo some half- and- half.
So...
Oh, golf, huh?
It seems every time I play, I get Tourette' s syndrome.
You know...
Fore!
Shit, damn, crap.
Shit, damn, crap.
Hey, dork.
Turn it to Channel 7, dipshit.
You can say "dipshit" with that thing.
That' s neat.
Come on, have some more.
You probably don' t eat this well very often on your salary.
- Mama, leave him alone.
- Aw, that' s OK, Jo.
I' il find room.
So, Willy, what do they pay you down there for gassin 'strays?
No, ma' am, I don' t gas them.
Hit 'em with a bat?
No, I meant I' m not the one who actually puts them to sleep.
I couldn' t do that.
And as for the pay, it' s not much, but it plays into my long- term career goal.
- Which is?
- I wanna be a veterinarian.
You' d be a great vet.
Doctor Noble.
Thanks, but it' s not gonna be easy.
Four more years at the junior college and I' il have my two- year degree.
And then I' il transfer over to State, and with a BA in general studies..... I should be able to get into any vet school in Mexico.
Sounds foolproof (!)
If Gilly says he' s gonna be a vet, then I believe he' s gonna be a vet.
Excuse me a minute.
Care for a taste of my pie?
I' m full.
Suit yourself.
I' m gonna have a slice.
Easy on the corns, Dr Dolittle.
The Lord,..... our Lord,..... has blessed me with the divine gifts of tracking, finding and retrieving.
Come on, Vic.
Just tell me what you have so far.
I' il tell you what I got.
But I believe that your birth mother is still alive and living somewhere in the local area.
And her name is..... Suki Yamaguchi.
That sounds a little, um,..... Japanese- y to me.
But so far, no luck.
What if you find out you' re the son of the guy who invented shoe polish?
I wouldn' t care if he just shined shoes for a living.
Not havin 'a family' s left a big, empty space inside of me.
- It' s really important that I find them.
- You will.
This is the first time I' ve ever been up here with anyone.
- You don' t like it up here, do you?
It' s fine.
Just being here reminds me of a bad time.
I was seven and we had to put our dog Humpy to sleep.
I still haven' t gotten over it.
- It' s ridiculous, I know.
- No, that' s not ridiculous at all.
Every Friday I see animals being put to sleep here..... and I wish that I could take 'em all home with me, but I can' t.
And every time one of those animals dies, I feel like a part of me dies too.
About a year ago, I wrote this poem that I recite to all the dogs before they go.
I like to think it helps them too.
I' d love to hear it.
No, it' s not very good.
I don' t care.
O noble creature
And for you to go to a better place
After a car or a bouncing ball
And fetch a stick that' s thrown by God
While a friendly voice repeats
"Good dog, good dog."
So that' s it.
And after I read it,..... I usually fire off a one- gun salute with a pistol we keep here at the shelter.
I know it sounds silly, but...
It doesn' t sound silly.
(Jo' s father) Help.
Very funny.
This is a great day.
It was a good idea.
- Shall we have the champagne?
Let' s wait till later.
You know, the day I cut your ear off,..... I never dreamed we' d be spending six months together.
Yeah, that is pretty funny.
I' ve had such a good time with you, just hanging out, having fun.
No strings attached.
Most guys are so possessive.
You know, they talk about marriage before the first year is even up.
There was this one schmuck, he actually went out and he got a plane and a banner.
It was so lame!
Talk about pressure.
- I' d love to, Gilly.
- Love to what?
I' d love to marry you.
That' s my Uncle Joe' s plane up there.
Joseph Wingfield... is your uncle.
I' m named after him.
You know, it probably should have occurred to me.
Boy, you don' t quit, do ya?
That' s the spot.
Oh, don' t go back there!
We gotta save some for the honeymoon.
What are you sayin ', Gilly?
Nothin '.
I was just... messin 'around with Ringo.
Hey, Jo.
Who' s Jack?
- What Jack?
- You know.
On- your- ass Jack.
Well, he' s my ex- boyfriend from Oregon.
I' ve been meaning to get it removed.
You' re the one with the half- naked Suzanne Somers over his bed.
Now don' t bad- mouth Suzanne.
She got me through my awkward teenage years.
- Do you mean you beat off to her?
- Not to brag, but... up to five times a day.
Do you wanna try to break that record?
Hey, it' s Gilly.
Leave a message.
It' s Vic.
I know it' s early, but are you there, buddy?
- I love you, Jo.
I found your mother.
I' m 110 per cent sure.
Your mother' s name is Valdine Wingfield.
You gotta understand.
I had just had little Jo and we were strapped for cash..... and then I found out I was pregnant again... with you!
Old R2- D2 couldn' t keep it in his pants back then..... and now he can' t even wipe his own ass!
I just didn' t know how I was gonna feed everybody and you were such a hungry child!
You know, to somebody who wouldn' t resent you for your burden.
I mean, one of you had to go and Jo was already house- broke.
This can' t be happening.
I know how difficult this must be for you.
But think how lucky you are that you found out before it was too late,..... before you got married and consummated this forbidden relationship.
Sweet Lord!
You ponied your sister.
Oh, my God.
Hey, maggot.
- Nothin '.
- What you got there?
Well, I' d say Cougar.
What do you think, Wingfield?
It' s a coyote, Stewart.
There are no cougars in Indiana.
Hell, I' m talkin 'about the car.
Looks like Cougar tread.
- I used to work in a tyre store, you know.
- Well, I used to work at the animal shelter.
- Hey, Gilly, you know I had no choice.
Know how it feels when newspapers call you the boss of a sister- fucker?
Whole damn town thinks I' m runnin 'a sister- fuckeria.
Coulda stuck by me, Larry.
It was gonna blow over.
Who are you shittin '?
Not that I blame you.
I mean, if I had a sister that looked like that... whoa!
Wham- bam- thank- you- sis!
You' re right about that.
You know, I' d say, sister or no, I' d still like to get a crack at her.
That is, if she ever comes back.
- Is she still up in Oregon?
- As far as I know.
Chop chop!
(Jo) Dearest Gilly, I' m sorry I left without saying goodbye.
I just couldn' t face you after all that' s happened.
The feelings that once seemed so right became in an instant so wrong.
Though it pains me to say it, we must never see each other again.
And though we must never forget the love we shared,..... we must, like noble creatures, move on to another plane.
Valdine?
- Valdine!
I' m busy.
Put lots of salt on that sandwich.
- You want a lot of salt?
- Yes.
- Here you are, honey.
Nice and salty.
Hey, Gilly.
How was your day at work?
It was pretty slow.
Just snakes, mostly.
Well, dinner' s almost ready.
I made that nice chicken thing you like.
- Hey, Dad.
- I thought you were gonna get a haircut.
Now, Walter, hush.
- Gilly' s been through a lot.
- Includin 'his own sister.
I' d better get it.
Hello?
Hi, honey.
How are you?
How' s Jack?
Good, good.
Oh, he' s fine.
He' s been through a lot, but he' s hanging in there.
I know you miss him.
But guess what.
He' s regained the use of both of his arms now.
You know, they move every which way.
OK, well, what is it?
You' re getting married?
Oh, Jo- Jo, that is so wonderful!
It' s Jo- Jo.
Oh, my God.
Isn' t that wonderful?
Sweetheart, I am really, really happy for you.
OK, sure.
I' il talk to you tomorrow.
Bye- bye.
Yes!
The Wingfields have arrived!
- Pervert!
- Gilly, how' s your sister?
- I know.
- I think you should be happy for your sister.
After what you put her through,..... it' s a wonder she didn' t quit the sausage and become a vagina- tarian.
Oh, good God.
Gilly, listen.
Things are really looking up for her.
She' s got a little beauty parlour up there and a guy who' s crazy about her..... and, quite frankly, a millionaire several times over.
Quit babying the boy, Valdine.
He banged his own sister, for Christ' s sakes.
What do you want?
Listen to me.
This could be a whole new start for us all, so I want you to keep your chin up.
Do you know what the Bible says about fuckin 'your own sister?
- Don' t!
- Hush up, droopy.
He' s my baby, my precious gift from God.
- (door bell) - I' il get it.
I baked you some ginger snaps.
They' re cooling on the stove.
- What do you want?
- Sorry to bother you, Mrs Wingfield.
- My name is Leon Pitofsky.
- Oh, my God.
- No.
It' s just... you look remarkably like my dear husband when he was a much younger man.
Well, that stands to reason, ma' am.
(Valdine) Look at this.
It' s all there.
Look.
Here' s your signature, givin 'up your rights to me.
Oh, my Lord.
Then it' s true.
You are my son.
I' ve finally found you, Mama!
Well, if he' s your son, then who the hell' s this sack of shit?
He' s a shyster that' s been freeloading in this house for a solid year!
- I knew it!
Hippie?
Whoa, hold on.
Walter, get that impostor outta here.
- Dad, relax.
- Hey, buddy, you heard my mama.
Now get the hell out.
Get your hands off my daddy, you bastard!
- Walter!
He' s havin 'another stroke.
- Dad, what' s the problem?
My God!
You can get the...
Get the police!
I' il have this grifter arrested!
- (Leon) Police.
- Get an ambulance!
What does it mean now?
Oh, my God.
Oh, shit.
Mr Magoo!
You knocked my freakin 'legs off, daddy.
Were you even lookin 'at the road?
I' m sorry.
I' ve never hit anyone before.
Hope I was gentle.
Now, be a friend and fetch my getaway sticks, daddy.
- Your what?
- My legs, captain, my legs!
Oh, shit.
Less faeces, more fetchin '.
Get over here and get it, boy.
I gotta straighten this damn thing.
It' s bent all to hell.
- Watch out, watch out.
- Watch out?!
Boy, that is a hell of a thing for you to say to me.
Well, in all fairness, you were in the middle of the road.
How else was I supposed to flag you down?
I was a desperate man.
Another 20 minutes and them bloodthirsty mosquitoes woulda sucked me dry.
- How long have you been out here?
- Oh, about two hours.
My airplane ran outta gas.
I had to land in a clearing.
- You' re a pilot?
- You' re goddamn right I' m a pilot.
My card, right there.
- "The Big Dig"?
- That' s right.
Dig McCaffrey.
I make a lotta coin flyin 'those gigs nobody else wants.
Take sportsmen out to the bush, fly banners over supermarket openings, crop- dustin '.
I' il fly up your ass if the money' s right.
Hey, that' s pretty good.
Do you think I oughta put that on my card?
- So where am I takin 'you?
- As close to Beaver as you can get.
And a man as sexy and fertile as me likes to stay close to the beaver.
- That' s a good one!
- That' s right where I' m headed.
Say, you look like you' re draggin 'there, chief.
Why don' t you let me drive?
- Oh, no, that' s fine.
- I' m wired.
Nothin 'like gettin' bounced off a bumper to put a cat on full tilt.
So, where' s your launch pad, Kerouac?
- My what?
Where you from?
- I' m from Indiana.
- You remind me of a fella I knew..... down in El Paso durin 'my import- export days.
Never been there.
So, who' s the skirt?
- How did you know that I was...?
- Dig knows many things, baby.
Plus you got that look of a man with a diamond engagement ring on his pinkie.
About a year ago, she was the love of my life.
Then I found out she was my sister.
Then, about three days ago...
Dig!
Just a little case of the white- line fever, that' s all, baby!
Dig just needs a little music.
Rock and roll, baby!
I' d like to see somebody fall asleep to this shit here...
Ted Nugent!
Hey, Dig!
Are you crazy?
I' m wired like a microwave, baby!
Well, before we depart,..... I want you to know two things, El Paso.
One:
I am one- eighth Chippewa Indian.
And when you save the life of a Chippewa, it must be paid back tenfold.
- That' s not necessary, but thank you.
No, no, no.
Heap big, daddy.
I appreciate everything you done for me.
- What was the other thing?
You said you wanted me to know two things.
I was sayin '...
Oh, yeah.
When you find that sister of yours, you get outta this town, ASAP.
- Some spooky cats around here.
- What kinda spooky cats?
The kind with money and power.
That sounds like the kinda guy Jo is with.
Well, good luck flippin 'that coin, daddy.
I' il see you later, El Paso.
Thanks for not suing me.
A pleasure bein 'hit by a man of your calibre.
- Yes.
I' m calling from Shelbyville, Indiana.
His name is Gilbert Noble.
He' s still very dangerous and he' s on his way to Beaver this very minute.
His own sister, huh?
You know, I didn' t know Jo Wingfield had a brother.
- Do you have a description of the pervert?
I have his mug shot, taken last year when he was arrested protesting for animal rights.
Sounds like a bad apple.
Why don' t you fax that over?
I' d rather this didn' t get back to Jo.
She and Jack have so much on their minds, what with the big wedding.
I' d appreciate you being discreet about this.
Absolutely, ma' am.
Beaver Police are known for their discretion.
- Yeah.
How' s your family?
- Fine.
Would you like the standard bikini wax?
Better landscape the whole yard.
So... do you ever miss cutting hair, Jo?
No, not really.
I mean, my heart wasn' t into it, like it is with bikini waxing.
I was just born to yank.
Gilly?
Mama, how could you not have told me he was coming?
I' m sorry, baby.
I know I should have.
I just kept praying he' d come to his senses and get over it.
Poor, crazy guy.
What do you mean, crazy?
I hate to tell you this.
Leon.
He' s been going all over town and telling everybody he' s not your brother,..... but this fellow Leon is.
- Poor Gilly.
- Don' t you worry about him.
Your mama has enough love and compassion for that wounded bird.
I guess I should worry about how to break this to Jack.
You can' t tell Jack.
It would break the poor man' s heart.
Hey, Rich, wake up.
Hi, Jack.
I want you to go on over to the hotel.
Tell Chaney I sent you.
He' il put it on my account.
- I don' t wanna take your money.
- I' il tell you somethin '.
I got my business and most of my money from my father.
- The least I can do is to give something back.
- I just need another ten minutes.
You do as I say, all right?
Come see me in the morning and we' il talk about gettin 'you ajob.
- Thanks, Jack.
- Hey, gimme that.
Keep marching.
I' il have my brother Jimmy come back and check on you later, all right?
I' m great, I' m great.
Look, I was wondering if maybe me and you could go to the diner, grab some coffee.
- You know, like old times.
- Oh, Gina, I' d love to.
I' d hate to embarrass my bride- to- be.
Yeah, well, actually your bride- to- be was gonna be the topic of conversation.
I had this picture on my cell wall.
It was my hope for the future.
This was my reason for gettin 'out.
You had a picture of a car on your wall?
Damn, Jimmy!
Did you beat off to it?
Hell, no!
I spanked it to that baby right there.
This is the only car in the world that makes me flex my love muscle.
- Jimmy loves you.
- Jimmy, get off the car.
I was just givin 'it a full body dust.
- Just try not to spooge on it.
- Spooge on it!
Shut up.
Listen, Jimmy.
I got a security problem I want you to deal with.
His name' s Gilbert.
Jo' s brother.
I didn' t know Jo had a brother.
Some families have brothers they don' t like to talk about.
Just make sure he disappears, all right?
- Done and done.
- Jimmy,..... feel free to rough him up a little bit.
Excuse me, sir.
A friend of mine has a salon here in town.
Her name is Jo Wingfield.
- I don' t suppose...
She works at Beaver Cuts.
You just take a left on Main, you go down about three blocks on the right.
In fact, I just went by there on my lunch break and I saw Jo in the window.
Great.
Yeah.
Say hi to Jo for me.
- I will, for sure.
Hey, buddy.
You know where a fella gets a beer around here?
I was...
Damn right you ain' t from around here!
Come on, Freddy, let' s go!
Hey, Jack.
- Somethin 'you wanna tell me, Jo?
I know about..... about you and... your brother.
Oh, God.
Dammit!
- I' m sorry.
- Sorry?
I' m the one who should be sorry, Jo.
You poor thing.
It' s not your fault.
You had no way of knowing he was your brother.
It' s like a Greek tragedy.
I think about it, it breaks my heart.
And how devastating it must have been for you.
For both of you.
God, that poor guy!
- I' m sorry, Jo.
- Oh, Jack!
Mister!
Can I have your peanuts, por favor?
- Sure.
- Gracias.
(captain) Please put your seats to the upright position..... in preparation for our arrival in Puerto Vallarta.
("Louie Louie" by The Kingsmen)
You don' t get it?
What, did your adoptive mother drop you on your head?
No one can see you till after the wedding.
Until then, yourjob is to find Gilly Noble and keep him out of the way.
Bye, Dad.
- Valdine, slow down.
- Shut up, Walter!
- (Valdine) Christ!
- Have fun!
Jack?
- Look at my hard worker.
- Honey, why are you home?
I closed the shop early so I could get some of the wedding chores done.
Great.
Take that cute little dress off and come on in.
No, I gotta get some things done.
Tell you what.
While you' re out there, pick your mom up somethin 'nice for her arrival.
That' s sweet, Jack.
Now scoot before I pull you in here with me.
- Take your time, why don' t you!
Come here.
My future son- in- law!
- Look at you.
It' s been a long time.
I' m so excited about the wedding.
Watch it, jerk- off!
I' m gonna get both of ya.
Sorry, Walter!
Oh, man, that musta hurt!
You all right?
I' m gonna kick your ass.
What' s that, Walter?
You say you wanna lick my ass?
Everything' s cool, Jack.
We got it under control.
You could be movin '.
Right up the stairs.
Gracias.
- What' s up, buckaroo?
- I have an appointment with Jo Wingfield.
OK.
Do you think that you could give her a note for me?
Uh...
Can I borrow a pen?
- Thanks.
- You' re welcome.
You!
Pre- vert!
Wait a minute.
No, I...
9- 11!
I' m calling!
Oh, man.
(police radio) All units, subject last seen behind Beaver Cuts.
- You diggin 'my system now, ain' t ya?
- Hey, Dig.
Stand down, Frito Bandito.
Can' t you see I' m playin 'keno?
- Dig, it' s me, Gilly.
- I don' t know no goddamn Gilly.
El Paso.
El Paso!
Sit on down.
You look like you' re all grown up, boy.
This is a disguise, Dig.
Apparently there are people in this town that don' t like me.
I gotta find my truck.
Ooh, truck.
- Yeah, trouble.
- What' s the problem?
He had a charity event last night.
Shit, a good time.
- People paid to beat the hell outta my truck?
- Set me back ten bucks.
I think I threw out my shoulder with your quarter panels.
Whacked it once, and again, then it broke.
That son of a bitch!
I cannot believe Jo is gonna marry that Mitchelson creep!
- She' s marryin 'Jack Mitchelson?
- Yes, in two days, Dig.
I gotta find a way to stop it and I need your help.
Slow down, Speedy Gonzales!
You can count Dig outta any plans to jack up the jig for Jack.
Am I right?
- Yeah, he' s the best.
Folks like him round here.
Why don' t you just leave well enough alone, OK?
Let her marry Jack.
Bein 'with him is like winnin' the husband Super Lotto.
Listen.
If you really love this girl as much as you say you do,..... just tell her goodbye and good luck.
But I don' t know if I can live without her.
- Hello?
- Jo!
How' s it goin 'at...
- What?
- He was here, at the shop!
- When?
Oh, my God.
Ugh!
Morning, Daddy.
- Morning, Jo.
- Where are you headed off to?
- I just got somethin 'I have to do.
Wait, wait.
I' il go with you.
- No, it' s something I have to do on my own.
- I could go with you, keep you company.
It' il be boring.
- Not to me, sweetheart.
See you later.
(Walter) Help!
- Bees!
Oh, my God!
Stay absolutely still.
I gotta go get my camera.
God, this is too great for words!
I' ve been walkin 'for ever.
- Jo!
- Gilly, I' ve been lookin 'all over for you.
Mama told me how you' ve been tellin 'everyone about your imaginary friend, Leon.
- That' s what she said?
- You gotta accept the truth.
We can' t be together, ever.
I' m glad that you said that because, um...
If you really love this girl as much as you say you do,..... just tell her goodbye and good luck.
You' re right.
Then what are you doin 'here in Beaver?
I just wanted to...
I just wanted to say goodbye..... and... good luck.
I really do.
And I promise, after today I' il never bother you again.
Don' t make it sound so sad, Gilly.
We' il still see each other at..... family funerals and stuff.
Goodbye, Jo.
I love you.
I love you too.
- Dig!
What the...?
- Settle down, El Paso.
Here you go, Benjy.
Now remember, you promised not to smoke those till you' re 12.
Right on.
- You wanna tell me what' s goin 'on?
He is one evil dude.
Who is?
- Mitchelson!
He' s the snarliest cat this town has ever seen, baby.
- But you said he...
- That was just show business.
You gotta toe the line for John Q Public.
This town' s got elephant ears, baby.
You can' t trust anybody any more.
Come on, El Paso.
Slide over to my place.
El Paso, you got your work cut out for you, baby.
Jack Mitchelson got millions from his daddy.
And, in my experience, women like dead presidents more than broke boyfriends.
No romance without finance, daddy.
Hey, Jo' s not like that.
Shit.
Love may be blind, but it can still smell that money, baby.
Not to mention... there' s a lotta cash in sellin 'grass.
- What does that mean?
- Hey, Sherlock.
Jack Mitchelson is the biggest marijuana grower in the Pacific Northwest.
You are not seein 'the forest for the weed here, man.
This dude' s a pot grower, a reefer salesman, a doobie doctor.
That' s why Jack keeps Beaver squeaky- clean: to keep Johnny Law from sniffin 'around.
- How does he get away with it?
- Half the town' s on the payroll.
The rest... scared to death of that wombat.
Man!
We' ve gotta figure out a way to get Jo outta there.
Amen to that.
What we need, my friend, is a plan.
I' m gonna sit on down here and study on that for a minute.
That' s a nice doggy.
- Hell of a watchdog.
Nothin 'gets by him.
Hello, ladies.
Do you wanna dance?
- Be gentle with him, boys.
Wait a minute.
Look, if you' re tryin 'to scare me, you' ve done a terrific job, OK?
Fellas, this is uncalled- for!
Come on!
Look, this is unfair.
All' s I want is ten minutes with Jo.
Hey, who doesn' t?
Come on, Jimmy.
Let' s get down to business.
Right on the head!
- What?
Maybe you oughta be wearin 'your glasses.
Yeah, but they make me look stupid.
Pervert on the run!
Go get him, Freddy!
Keep away from me!
You can' t stop me from seein 'Jo.
I' m gonna marry her, you' il see!
You' re sick, man!
- He wants to marry his sister.
- He' d better not come back!
Yeah, that' s right, or we' il tie you to a tree, fuck you in the ass while we jerk you off!
Show you what we really do to perverts around here!
- You sicko!
- Keep runnin ', boy!
Hey, Dig!
- El Paso!
Up here!
- Dig, what are you doin 'up there?
- What do you mean, what am I doin 'up here?
You ever try jumpin 'off a roof with no legs?
It stings!
- What do you wanna do about this?
I got a leg for all seasons.
I' m not..... your brother. "
"Marry me."
Dig, this is great.
Thank you so much.
Finally I' m gonna be able to set the record straight.
- You sure there are two r' s in "marry"?
- Yeah, there' s definitely two r' s.
Good enough.
Are you sure you can fly with that thing?
I' m Dig McCaffrey, boy!
I could fly a can of Spam like this!
- How' d you lose those legs, anyway?
- Plane crash.
Come on, let' s light this firecracker.
- All right.
Let' s go, Dig.
They can hug all the trees they want.
It' s the government I worry about.
Barkeep!
Less talk and more vodka.
Yes, ma' am.
Gina?
- Get you a drink while I' m at it?
- Yeah, I' il have a nice, stiff one.
(Valdine) Jack, Jack, Jack.
How do you stay so fit?
El Paso, I got somethin 'here that' s gonna get their attention.
That' s my man Wagner!
That' s good, huh?
We' il come in low out of the afternoon sun.
- Check it out, El Paso.
- Hi, Jo!
Check out my banner!
I' ve missed you!
- I' m the one, Jo!
- Oh, my God.
The banner!
It says it all!
That Jack' s no good for you, Jo!
I' m the one!
I love you!
He really is crazy.
I knew that boy was trouble the minute I laid eyes on him.
Bill, we' ve got a code nine in progress.
Mobilise all units.
- Oh, yeah, Dig.
Holy shit!
It' s Beaver Five- O!
- What' s goin 'on, Dig?
- What' s goin 'on?
Start eatin '!
Gilbert Noble, please step out of the airplane with your hands behind your head.
Well, ship my ass to big red China!
They want the white boy.
What do they want with me?
I didn' t do anything.
I don' t know.
See you, stranger.
All right, get your hands up!
- What' s goin 'on here?
- OK, boys, grab him!
Hey, take it easy!
What' s goin 'on?
- This isn' t fair!
- Neither is stalkin 'your sister, son.
Straight to the nuthouse.
Jack Mitchelson has offered to pay for his therapy.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Today we' re discussing why it is wrong to have sex with someone related to you.
My wife was related to me.
I had sex with her.
That' s not the same thing, Mr Murphy.
Once a week we' d have sex, until she died.
Then it was three or four times a week.
We' re quite familiar with your case, Mr Murphy.
- Can we have pancakes tomorrow?
- We had pancakes yesterday, Mr Campisi.
Today I would like to talk about how Mr Noble can overcome..... his unnatural compulsions toward his sister.
He could kill her.
Mr Chin...
Can we have pancakes tomorrow?
I know you.
From before.
You hit me with a lead pipe.
I didn' t hit you.
- Uh, yeah.
- I don' t want any trouble now, OK?
You got any naked pictures of your sister?
Of course not.
Wanna buy some?
Ten bucks apiece.
- Where' d you get these?
- Jimmy brung them to me.
You know, to keep me company.
Not bad, huh?
He also brung me these 'ums.
Jo' s panties.
Used, too.
- Gimme those!
- Ten bucks apiece.
No way!
That' s my future wife!
You owe me a lotta money for them nakeds.
All right, here' s ten dollars.
That' s all I have.
Pancakes!
Pancakes!
We can try again another day (Dig) Gilly!
- (muffled cries)
Don' t worry, buddy.
The cavalry' s here.
It' s time for you to make your break.
There we go.
Dig, what are you doin 'here?
I told ya, a Cherokee always repays his debt.
- I thought you were one- eighth Chippewa.
- Right, and one- eighth Cherokee.
Dig' s a complex cat, baby.
Hey, are you the pancake guy?
- What' s he doin 'here?
- I went to the wrong room.
Come on, let' s get you outta here.
How does it feel to be off the rock, baby?
You are out!
You are free!
Feels great, Dig!
Thanks a lot!
I woulda sprung ya sooner,..... but after I ate all that weed, it took me two days just to pass the stems!
Leon?
Holy shit!
Dig, follow that car!
Pull over.
Pull over!
The Eager Beaver.
They used to shoot porno pictures there.
Did a screen test once.
Never heard anything.
That is Leon.
That' s Jo' s real brother.
He' s my proof.
Now all' s I gotta do is get her down here and show her.
Well, hell' s bells.
You better scoot.
Accordin 'to the paper, that wedding' s in less than three hours.
- Here, take my pony.
I couldn' t do that.
Possessions mean nothin 'to the Navajo.
You go and get your woman.
I' il make sure whiffle balls stays where he is.
And you get your ass off there, Campisi.
Today, son!
OK, Dig, thanks a lot.
Good journey.
All right, Campisi.
We got an assignment.
God, what the hell is this?
All right.
Move along.
Let' s go!
Get outta the way!
All right, now that' s it!
I' m tired of bein 'nice.
Now get off the road!
Get your smelly ass off the road!
I said get your butt...
Come on!
OK, come on, just relax.
Hold on.
- Just where you think you goin ', Leon?
- Who the hell are you?
I' m your warden till my friend Gilly gets back.
- Gilly?
I said it.
Don' t you...
I' m warnin 'ya.
Son of a bitch!
Get away from...
Goddammit!
Thief!
Looky there!
Cowpuncher!
Hey, you' re turnin 'the herd on!
Your sister turn you down?
That cow forgot to wipe its ass!
Giddy- up!
Why don' t you buy her dinner first?
That' s pretty funny (!)
Why don' t you get on with your life?
- It' s a puppet show!
- Grab her tits!
(Jo) Gilly, what are you doing?
Nothin '.
What are you doin '?
- I thought you were gettin 'married.
- I am, in an hour.
Zahf was just doing my make- up.
You' re supposed to be at the hospital, getting better.
Jo, listen.
I got great news.
I found Leon.
I found Leon, and I got him dead to rights.
That' s great, Gilly.
Why don' t you pull your arm out of Leon' s butt..... and we' il take a drive to the hospital?
No, Jo, this isn' t Leon.
This is just some cow that..... I got my hand... stuck in.
Jo, Leon' s at the Eager Beaver.
If you come with me, I will prove it to you.
Gilly, stop it, please!
You have issues.
- Gilly...
- Of course.
And that' s why Jack and I have decided to have a family of our own.
But, Jo, listen.
- Gilly, leave me to have my family.
Are those my missing underwear?
Jo, I can explain these.
I didn' t steal them.
I bought 'em off the same scumbag who sold me naked pictures of you.
In my country, for violating a sacred beast, you get beaten to death with bamboo sticks!
Pre- vert!
Oh, my God.
The ring!
That was one evil trip.
Well, this is it, Daddy.
The day every girl dreams about.
You' il like living up here.
You' il have the best medical care and Mama won' t have to work so hard.
Is this what you want?
What do you mean?
I mean..... are you happy?
Why wouldn' t I be happy?
I mean, this is a great thing, for all of us.
Show time, Mr Wingfield.
- Hey, pervert.
- Hey, Streak.
- What are you doin '?
- Ain' t no mental home that' il hold Streak.
That' s my truck.
- Get your hands up!
Was your truck.
It looks really nice.
She' s my home now.
So technically you' re standin 'on my front lawn.
Back your ass up off my property and into them woods.
OK, Streak.
Just take it easy.
You shouldn' t have cheated me on those panties.
Just relax.
Everything' s all right.
The pictures and the underwear and everything.
- I' il take that too.
- That' s my ring!
It' s my ring now, pretty boy.
Why don' t you turn around?
We' re gonna take a nature walk.
Streak, come on now.
I gave you everything you wanted.
And do you, Josephine Wingfield, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?
I do.
And do you, Jack Mitchelson, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?
I do.
If anyone amongst you can show just cause..... why these two should not be joined in holy matrimony,..... speak now or forever hold your peace.
- (Walter) Stop.
Sorry.
It' s the machine.
It malfunctions when the battery' s low.
Just go right ahead.
She' s... in love with...
Here we go.
Problem solved.
Just go on.
I now pronounce you... blah- blah- blah.
Very well.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Well, what do we got here?
Gilly Noble.
Look at you tasty beauty, you.
You ain' t gonna mess up my sister' s wedding, you pervert!
Here' s my wedding present, Mama!
- Yes.
It' s just all the excitement.
He' d love to join you, but he' s not up to it.
One, two,..... three...
I' d like to propose a toast.
A toast to my baby girl, to little Jo,..... who has finally found the man of her dreams, a man that is not only the... (police siren)
Cops?
See ya!
What' s goin 'on?
Sorry to bother you, Jack.
Mrs Mitchelson, I' m afraid we have some... bad news.
There' s been an accident.
His truck... blew up.
Body was burned beyond recognition, ma' am.
By the time we got to the scene, coyotes had torn off some of the major body parts.
- They even ate his...
- Gina!
I think that' s enough description of the deceased for right now.
Are you sure that it was Gilly?
We found this ring on his finger bone, with your names inscribed on it.
Ashes, mostly.
Put 'em in my Thermos.
Thought you might like to keep 'em for a remembrance.
He killed himself.
I know it!
- It' s all my fault.
- No, that is not true, ma' am.
Your brother is in that Thermos on account of a fella I have in custody here.
Bring him out.
Leon?
- (Leon) Mama!
It was an accident!
I didn' t mean to bump his car, and then it exploded.
He' s your brother, Jo.
- Your real brother.
- We hid the truth from you..... because Valdine wanted a crack at Jack' s money..... and, Lord help me, so did I.
So are you sayin 'that Gilly was never my brother?
We did it for your own good.
He was a dog- catcher.
You' re just crazy, OK?
- No.
- I' m just very confused right now.
- No, don' t apologise to him.
- He set the whole thing up.
- That' s a lie!
Ask him if the name Vic Vetter rings a bell.
- Jack sent Vic false information about Gilly.
You tell her, Valdine.
You tell her the truth.
You' re sick!
You' re fucking sick!
I hope you all make one big happy family.
Just don' t include me.
Look at you!
- She deserves a better life.
- How dare you ruin my wedding?
- Blow me.
You did this!
I' m gonna kill you!
Son of a bitch!
I' m gonna kill you!
Mama!
- Mama?
Gina, better call them ambulance boys.
We need an ambulance ASAP.
It looks like a possible coronary, or some sort ofjiggling...
Holy shit!
- It' s the ghost of El Paso past!
- Hi, Dig.
"Hi, Dig" shit!
I thought you was barbecue!
- So everybody thinks I' m dead.
Campisi too.
I guess it' s probably all for the better.
Now Jo can really get on with her life here.
I' ve no idea how I' m gonna get home.
Dig McCaffrey, at your service.
I can' t believe you put it on.
That' s good, huh?
- Are you serious?
- It' s the least I can do..... after whalin 'on your truck with a sledgehammer.
Come on, El Paso.
The bird' s out front and all gassed up.
What you gonna do?
- Let' s light that firecracker.
- You bet your ass.
O noble creature
And for you to go to a better place
- Gilly, deep down, I always did believe you.
- I know that, Larry, and I do appreciate it.
If you don' t mind, I' il sneak you in the back door.
Hey, is that Jo?
Jo!
And fetch the stick that' s thrown by God
Gilly?
Oh, my God.
Jo, I thought you killed yourself.
I was just givin 'you the one- gun salute.
I can' t believe you' re alive!
Now, Valdine, don' t be so sad.
You' re gainin 'a son.
(voice synthesizer) Blow it out your ass, Walter.
First of all, congratulations on your nuptials.
- I wanna wish you much happiness.
- Thanks, Vic, but we got guests.
I know you got guests, but I got some good news.
I found your mother.
Your real mother this time.
Free of charge.
- I don' t know, Vic...
- Listen to me, Gilly.
She flew all the way from California to meet you.
My baby!
My precious gift from God!
Suzanne Somers is my mother?
Gilly, didn' t you used to...?
I came from the most beautiful place on Earth...... where music was everywhere.
And people believed there was no difference...... between being awake and dreaming.
My dream was always clear.
For as long as I could remember, I wanted to be a musician.
That' s my mother.
She' s the one who taught me how to sing.
That' s me.
Whenever I heard her voice, all I wanted was to be held in her arms...... so I could be closer to the source of the magic.
When my mother suddenly died...... I felt like everything around me had died too.
I couldn' t feel anything anymore.
The only thing that kept me going were the letters from Uncle Alfonso.
He' d gone to Los Angeles and made it big in the restaurant business.
He said the streets really were paved with gold if you worked hard enough.
I didn' t know what to do, so I asked my grandfather, a very wise man...... what he thought.
And he told me that all of life is a dream...... and I should choose my dreams carefully...... because they' re very powerful things.
So I set off to chase my dream:
Los Angeles, City of Angels.
And my future?
Well, yet to unfold.
Who would' ve thought I' d end up like this?
It turned out that Uncle Alfonso wasn' t the taco king of L. A.
He didn' t even own the place.
But he was the assistant manager and he did get me this job...... so I shouldn' t complain, but I can' t take those hats.
Here she comes.
Okay.
- Hi.
- Hello.
What can I do for you?
That' s Nina, the love of my life.
And she doesn' t even know that I exist.
Okay.
Happy Burrito with extra cheese.
- To go.
- To go.
Absolutely.
Hi there, baby doll...... angel...... precious...... beautiful pussycat.
When you look at me...... you kill me.
You make me chase my tail in circles.
Okay, that' s going to be 3. 75.
And I' m really sorry about him.
Yeah, whatever.
That' s 3...... and that' s 4.
- There you go.
Have a beautiful day.
- Thank you.
You' il be back, pussycat.
I know it.
Don' t bet on it, taco boy.
Dude, you suck.
You know that women don' t like your macho comments.
What they appreciate is to be spoken to with respect.
Respeto, that' s what it' s all about, chivo.
What you talking about?
She was hot.
Didn' t you see that?
I' il show some respeto.
I' il be like, "Call me taco boy!
Call me taco boy! "
It' s amazing what depths a person will sink to when they get desperate.
But as long as I could play my music, I didn' t care.
Most people have forgotten about the dreams that brought them here.
But then again, so have I.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
This next song is "Lonely Girl."
And remember, the more you drink, the better I sound.
Thank you.
Clean this up.
Thank you very much.
We' re gonna take a short break...... and I' il be right back, so please don' t go away.
Thank you.
Julián.
Come here.
Give me a hand with the stuff.
Hey.
Wake up.
Okay.
You guys...... are so losing your Game Boy...... as soon as I get this in the house.
- Gonna give me a hand?
- I' il give you a hand.
I got it.
- Please, let me help you.
It' s okay.
- Do you play?
- Yeah.
- And where do you live?
- I live next door.
Well, I hope you' re not planning on making too much noise, okay?
Wait, wait.
Let' s do this right.
My name' s Antonio.
- Hi.
- What' s your name?
Mirabela.
- Let' s get started.
- Okay, and just this one.
I can get the rest.
Just this one will be good.
Hi.
I just wanted to say to you that...... that I' m really sorry about my co- worker' s behaviour the other day.
He' s just not....
He' s not very smart sometimes.
- You' re the guy from the taco place.
I' m Antonio.
- I' m Nina.
- How are you?
Look, I wanted to ask you...... I don' t know if you wanted to go to dinner or dancing this Friday...... I was wondering if you were available to do me the honour?
Is that a date you' re asking for?
I think so.
I' m flattered, but I will have to say no.
- Because I have to work on Friday.
I' m sorry.
Maybe some other time.
Okay.
Hey.
I' m gonna be there anyway, Friday night at La Zona Rosa...... if you....
- If you change your mind or....
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Thank you.
Who was that?
I don' t know.
Just some guy.
What' s up, uncle?
Antonio, look around this place.
It doesn' t take all these people to roll a burrito.
We have way too many workers.
We' re gonna have to let someone go.
Since you were the last one hired...... l guess you have to be the first one fired.
I can' t do anything about it.
It' s corporate.
But I' m family!
I' m your blood!
I' m really sorry.
Here.
Here' s a week' s pay.
Take it!
Take it!
It' il hold you over...... for a while at least, until you find something else.
You' il be okay, Tonio.
You' re young, you' re strong.
- You' il be okay, eh?
- Sure.
Thanks for everything, uncle.
I don' t know, maybe I' il go back to Mexico.
You know, I would if I could...... but I can' t because I' m a total failure.
Yeah, it' s a setback.
Yeah, but nobody wants to hear my music.
Girls don' t wanna be with a broke musician.
I don' t know.
I' m scrawny, I' m short.
Don' t let nobody tell you about what people wanna hear.
People get tired of being sold the same old thing over and over again.
After a while, they look for something real.
- You think?
- Yeah, that' s why I took this NPR job.
Oh, the NPR job, right.
Because that pays the big dollars.
I don' t know.
Maybe you should enter that contest.
What contest?
What contest?
It' s only the largest Latino band competition this side of Tijuana.
- How come I haven' t heard about it?
- I don' t know.
But I' il tell you this:
The winner gets to open a concert for a world- famous mystery musician.
You know what the top money is?
The top band wins 10, 000.
Ten thousand dollars?
Ten thousand dollars.
Hey!
Hey.
Keep the noise down.
Antonio!
Jeez.
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
If you' re gonna play music...... then play music.
You might wanna hear something from my collection.
You have a collection?
I gotta see this.
Let me just see what you have.
- The oldies.
- That' s the good stuff.
You don' t have to tell me that.
Come on.
Come inside, we' il play them together.
No, thanks, I' ve heard them.
I gotta get back to my card game.
- Oh, yeah?
What are you playing?
- Solitaire.
Solitaire?
Oh, come on, by yourself?
Come over here, we' il play the songs.
José José.
You know, my father used to play with him.
And he told me some gossip.
He said that José José' s father...... only wanted classical music in the house...... because he was an operatic singer...... and forbade him to play that pop.
- Well...
- I want to see that.... let' s see if you know who this is.
Do you know --?
- Okay, I don' t wanna see it.
- I know how to do this, thank you.
I know that.
That' s Paquita la del Barrio.
Also known as Francisca Viveros Barradas.
The defender of women against el macho.
- She' s from my hometown.
- Oh, is she?
Yeah.
She sings about getting dumped.
I can relate.
Do you know who this is?
- Perfidia.
Perfidia.
- Who?
That' s Alberto Dominguez, and his Xavier Cugat version.
When they told Xavier Cugat that his music...... was too much middle- of- the- road...... he said, "Well, I' d rather play 'Chiquita Banana'...... and have a swimming pool than play Bach and starve."
- He said that?
- Yes, he did.
- How come you know so much?
- Because I' m a geek, that' s why.
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?
You' re just incredible, the way you sing.
It made the hair on my arm stand up, look at that.
- You should be singing all the time.
- No, I' m too old.
I used to sing.
But that was a long time ago.
With my ex, Javier.
Back in Veracruz, we had some really good times.
And then he came here, he met some pocha Pop- Tart...
-... and dumped me.
- You know what...... forget the loss, you know, just be happy that it happened.
Yeah.
Well, I' ve stayed too long.
I gotta get back to my kids.
Enjoy the records.
And don' t play them too loud.
Okay.
Making your intention your reality.
My 10- step program for making the intention...... of creating a stress- free, tranquil mind your daily experience.
Step one:
Remember that your natural state is joy.
This is El Zorro coming at you from L. A. 's best music.
That' s Latin America' s best music.
Now settle back...... here' s a groove for you that' s gonna warm up your afternoon.
- I' m gonna have to clean that window.
- You' re --
Look at that.
I' m gonna do it.
I' m gonna do it.
- You' re gonna go back to Mexico?
- Yeah, that' s what I' m going to do.
I want to enter the contest.
- I knew it.
- What do you mean, you knew it?
- I knew it.
- But I gotta change my sound.
I can' t be likee everybody else.
I' m not a boy anymore.
I can' t do that 18- year- old, hormone- crazed --
I don' t know.
You know what?
I like your style.
- Why?
- I think it' s young.
- I think it' s hip, it' s got energy.
- You do?
- Yeah.
- I don' t know.
I mean, I wanna keep the old- school sound vibe.
I don' t know.
You gotta help me find a band.
Help me find some guys I have a chemistry with.
I think I' ve got a couple of guys that could be just the right guys for you.
Okay, we' re back.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
Oh, sorry.
Excuse me.
I was....
You had a "Help Wanted" sign out there?
Hey, Vijay, uncle!
Someone' s here for the job.
Raj, I' m right here.
There' s no need to yell, son.
- So you' re looking for a job, huh?
- Yes, sir.
You ever pump gas before?
No, sir.
Well, that' s all right, because we don' t have any gas pumps.
Right?
You seem like a good guy.
You got the job.
You start tomorrow morning, 8 a. m.
Minimum wage.
That' s okay, it' s great.
I' il be here a half- hour early then.
- Thank you very much.
- You' re very welcome.
Thanks a lot.
Sorry about that.
- It' s cool.
It' s all right.
- Don' t worry about it.
- Okay.
Bye- bye.
- Not a problem.
- Not a problem?
Okay.
- Clumsy fellow, huh?
- Shit happens.
I like him.
Papá, please eat your food.
I thought we were going out.
Why aren' t you dressed yet?
I don' t think I should leave him.
Come on.
He' s gonna be fine.
You don' t do anything anymore except study and worry about your dad.
You' re turning into a geek.
Are you gonna be all right without me, Papá?
Sure, mija.
You go out and have fun.
Okay, I' m gonna change really fast.
Come on, let' s go dance.
- No.
- Yeah.
Thank God you broke me out of my house.
- I know.
It' s about time, right?
- Yes.
That' s him, right?
He looks super cute tonight.
- He looks super busy to me.
- What are you talking about?
He looks like a nice guy.
I don' t think he' s into her.
I' m very sorry.
He' s breaking his neck to get over here.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
May I have this dance with you?
- Can I open my eyes now?
- No, no.
No, don' t look.
It' s worth the wait.
You' il see.
Almost there.
Okay, here we are.
All right, you ready?
It looks so small.
Nothing like it feels.
You know, sometimes when I just feel like...... the whole city' s gonna swallow me up...... and I don' t want to crawl on all fours anymore...... I come up here and I feel....
I feel like anything can happen up here.
I can, I don' t know, suck the moon.
I could be president.
Oh, God, I' m weird, right?
What do you wish?
I wish that...... my mother was still alive.
One day...... I told her that...... I would be the first one in the family to be a doctor.
A veterinarian.
And I' il never forget...
... she smiled at me and she said:
"Paloma...... you' re gonna be the best...... veterinarian in the world."
You' re going to be.
I know it.
I feel it.
No.
Because she' s gone now.
I know, I know.
Oh, my God, you' re beautiful.
Inside and outside.
I' m sorry.
I don' t know, I couldn' t help myself, I....
What?
Come here.
Come on, Papá.
I' il help you into bed.
Papá?
Yes, doctor.
Hold on one moment, please.
- Hi, Miss Acosta?
- Yes.
- I' m Dr. Lopez.
- Hi.
I' m happy to say that your father' s gonna be fine.
Thank you, doctor.
He had a stroke, but it was only a minor one.
He' s gonna need some extra care for a while, but he' s gonna fully recover.
- Can I see him now?
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.
- This way.
- Stop.
- I just don' t know...... why he left his children.
That I' il never understand.
All right, all right.
You call Child Welfare...... and you report him.
That is what you do.
I can' t.
You are not over him, are you?
I am so completely over that pig of a man.
You know what I' m gonna do?
- I am gonna do a psychic reading.
- Oh, God, no.
Yes, and you' re gonna love it.
That' s what you need right now.
- And are you ready?
- No.
Here we go.
There' s a man nearby.
- It' s giving me three clues.
- What do you mean, clues?
Well, so that you' il recognize him when you meet him.
First, he will be a great lover of music.
Oh, that' s nice.
Second, he will cherish the colour red.
He will serve you...... the greatest meal you have ever had.
So fabulous that you will scream with joy.
Or it might be the other way around where you' re serving him the meal.
I don' t know.
But either way, there' s food involved, for sure.
When do I meet him?
I don' t know.
Papá, I was so scared.
Nina.
Nina.
I thought I was gonna lose you too.
Why did you even worry?
You know I wouldn' t leave you.
Not yet, anyway.
You know, Nina...... I died for a minute, and guess what.
I saw Mamá.
Really?
- How is she?
- Oh, she is doing great.
Beautiful as ever.
And you know what else?
She says she will wait for me until it' s my time to cross over.
And she will have a big plate of my favourite spicy tamales...... just for me, so I can smell my way to the other side.
That' s sweet, Papá.
Just as long as you' re not planning on having those tamales too soon.
Mamá told me it is not my time yet.
No, it was amazing.
He actually talked to his dead wife.
No, it was amazing.
He actually talked to his dead wife.
Well, what was that...?
How did he end up...?
What was the communication between them?
It was tamales.
- Tamales?
- Yeah.
Imagine that.
Now, let' s go.
Here we are.
They' re great, huh?
Nobody knows who they are yet.
But they' re on their way up.
That' s Pancho on the guitar, Enrique on the bass...... and José on the drums.
Hey, Raj.
Raj, can I ask you something?
How long you been together with your girlfriend?
My fiancée.
And I' ve known her for about three years.
Three years, huh?
- Raj?
- Yep.
How did you know that she was the one?
First time I saw her, I knew.
You knew.
And did she know too?
Are you kidding?
I had to chase her around like some crazy fool.
But you know what they say, when a man knows, he knows.
It' s black and white for us men, no grey stuff in between.
Right.
That' s right.
Raj.
Last question.
How did you hook her?
I mean, how did you win her over?
What did you do?
Well, I never gave up, but I didn' t crowd her either.
I bought her a lot of beautiful gifts.
And most importantly, I made her confident I' d be able to provide for her.
Women wanna know that a guy can take care of her...... a guy that can really bring home the bacon.
I say this even though I' m a vegetarian.
- Well, thank you.
- You' re welcome.
Okay, okay.
Look, I hope I' m not bothering you.
Look, I just want to give you these flowers, that' s all.
Nothing more.
No, really.
She wouldn' t believe that.
Dr. Lopez will be here soon to check up on you, Papá.
Thank you, mija.
Here, let me close the curtains so you can watch your show better.
No, mija, that' s okay.
I like them open.
Look, I' m not stalking you.
No, why would l?
See?
It' s better like this.
Fuck!
Stop!
- What?
- What was that all about?
- What was what all about?
- You.
I mean, come on.
The band is not all about you and your guitar.
I know that, it' s just we' re playing with old amps.
Yeah?
You have to open them wide up or else it doesn' t sound good.
- You should know this.
- All right.
All right.
Can we just break it down a little bit so I could hear myself?
One, two.
One, two, three, four.
Wait, wait.
Pancho!
Pancho!
Pancho, I thought you told me you were cool with this setup.
You told me you were not the lead vocalist type.
- I never said that, man.
- Okay.
Look....
Look, we came here together for the contest, all right?
And exposure is something...... that each and every one of you needs right now.
So let' s drop the egos...... and let' s get out of the way of the music, okay?
I don' t know what' s wrong with me, man.
I' m sorry, man.
I don' t know what happened to me.
I don' t know what' s wrong with me.
We never had any trouble before that guy came in.
You know what I mean?
I think he plays good.
Well, yeah, I mean, the guy can play.
But he....
He doesn' t have the mojo that we need for the band, you know?
Yeah.
Look, guys, just go with me on this one, all right?
- We' re gonna win the $10, 000 -- - Thank you.
I got it.
We' re gonna win the $10, 000.
We' il open for the mystery musician.
We' il win the whole thing.
- You just gotta trust me on this.
- I just want to play.
We all want to play.
- Let' s do it.
- Come on.
Hi.
I came to see how the two of you are.
I left so many messages.
Hi.
I know.
I' m sorry.
I haven' t been able to return your calls.
It' s....
I' ve been really busy with Papá.
That' s not what I meant.
I mean, that' s why I came by, because I wanted to help you.
Well, there' s nothing that you can really do.
I just have to be here.
That' s why he got in trouble in the first place...... because I wasn' t here for him.
But now is when you really need your friends, right?
- I brought you something.
- No, I can' t take it.
Please, please.
I want you to have it.
I can' t be with you, Antonio.
Why?
I just can' t.
Please understand.
Don' t make it harder on me.
Nina...... I' m here for you.
X marks the place.
Thank you.
- Tonio.
- Hey.
I got some bad news.
They just called.
They' re not coming.
They quit.
- Quit?
- Yeah.
They want to go off on their own.
That' s great.
That' s....
That' s great.
That' s a really classy move.
Like, three days -- Right before the tryouts!
I know.
Tonio.
Tonio.
Come on.
I' il buy you one.
You know -- You know why?
Because he thinks he' s better than me.
He thinks because he went to the right schools...... he came from a better neighbourhood....
Listen.
I hear you.
Thank you.
Thank you for giving me that.
But it' s true.
He always....
Always has all those airs.
You guys have any requests?
Requests?
What do you call yourselves?
Los Hermanos Solitos.
"The Lonely Brothers."
Why so lonely, huh?
- We' re all single.
- We have no girlfriends, no wives.
No problem.
Right, that' s how it is.
You have anything original?
You got it.
- I always want something original.
Javier, you wanted me to sign the papers, I signed them.
That' s what you wanted, that' s what you got.
- Just leave me alone.
- No way.
But, Javier, look...... don' t forget to be a father to our babies, huh?
They need that.
You just can' t drop them too.
You can' t divorce your children.
Very good.
Antonio.
Where have you been?
For you.
- They' re red.
- Yes.
I just wanted to thank you for reminding me...... that my world is music.
Antonio, I....
- I don' t deserve this.
- What, are you kidding?
Don' t ever say that.
You' re wonderful.
Don' t doubt yourself.
Here.
- Come in.
- Oh, no, I can' t.
I gotta....
I gotta go down to Los Lobos and meet my new band.
Do you want to come with me?
I have a lot of laundry.
- Laundry?
And I don' t have anybody to look after my kids.
Kids.
But....
Doesn' t look like they' il notice.
- Maybe next time.
- Okay.
But these are so beautiful.
I feel like a queen.
That' s because you are one.
Okay.
Then all of a sudden he got mad, picked up the mike and threw it at me.
- And he walked out of the studio.
- Don' t do live interviews.
- I gotta.
That' s what I do.
- What if they don' t like you?
No, no.
I just make sure there' s no sharp objects.
- Mirabela.
- Hi.
I' m so glad you came.
I wasn' t sure if you were gonna come.
You look beautiful.
I want you to meet my manager.
El Zorro.
Thank you for coming.
You devilish charmer, you.
I want you to meet the rest of the group.
We have Rafael, el guitarrón.
Welcome.
- Adon on the percussions.
- Glad you could make it.
- Thank you.
- A pleasure.
And then we have here little Jorge on lead guitar.
Jorge.
Mirabela.
I wasn' t sure if you were gonna show up.
I really started to doubt it.
And since you' re here, why don' t we...... take this opportunity...?
Now you sing with me, come on.
Nice meeting you guys.
- I have to go.
- Why?
- Thank you.
- What happened?
I don' t know.
Mirabela.
Mirabela, it was perfect.
- Antonio.
- Did you hear?
Did you hear?
You complete the band.
Did you hear the way the room loved you?
It was just like my mother used to sing.
I' m not your mother.
I' m not that old yet.
I know.
That' s not what I meant.
Please listen to me.
- Look.
I' m not young or sexy anymore.
Come on.
Who wants to hear me sing?
I do.
I really do.
I can' t.
I just can' t.
Oh, Mirabela.
- ls it good?
- Oh, yeah.
I' ve never seen you eat this much, Papá.
I' m a new man now.
I feel so good that I could eat the whole world.
Well, you can start with your breakfast.
Where' s that nice young man you' ve been seeing?
I haven' t seen him around lately.
Since when did you notice such things?
I had a dream about the two of you last night...... and you were very happy together.
Well, that' s nice, but....
I don' t have time for dreams right now.
Our dreams are the most important thing in this life, preciosa.
Mirabela?
I' m back here.
Where?
So, what else do you do besides laundry?
Housecleaning.
- Could you reach that for me?
- You' re so silly.
- Hey!
What are you doing?
Hey.
Give me that.
- You want your laundry?
- Have you lost your mind?
- No, I wanna help you regain yours.
- What are you talking about?
- I know you really want to do this.
- Oh, God.
What makes you think I wanna do that?
- I hate the thought of even doing it.
- No, you don' t.
You love it.
This is part of you.
It' s your whole soul.
Oh, God.
- What?
- I thought you were different.
- What do you mean?
- You' re like all men.
You think that all a woman wants to do is play house?
Let me tell you something, okay?
I have dreams.
Big ones.
I wanna sing.
In front of the whole damn world.
What is so funny?
Oh, my God, yes.
I' m laughing at you.
Because you' re funny to me.
Oh, yes, you are.
You' re very funny to me.
I -- I --
I' m gonna see you at rehearsal, at 5: 00 today.
And don' t be late, okay?
Don' t mix colours with whites.
It gets very muddy.
You know how to do laundry.
Five o' clock.
Mirabela?
Can I ask you something?
I don' t know.
Have you ever been truly in love?
I' m not talking about, like, like.
I' m talking about, like, really, really in love?
I thought I was with Javier, but that was something else.
Right, but....
Look, but what if you were in love now, let' s say...... with somebody new today...... how would you tell them?
Who is she, anyway?
Well...... she' s this woman who doesn' t know her own beauty.
And I just -- I don' t know how to tell her.
Well, you don' t tell a woman anything...... just show her.
Show her you love her.
She' il understand.
Not in her head, but in her heart, where it counts.
Is that in a song somewhere?
Hey, come on.
You' il see.
Look, look.
Come on in.
They' il love you.
Come on.
You' il see.
Mirabela!
Hey, guys.
Hey, look, I' ve been working on this electronic loop and....
Welcome to the Super Estrella Mystery Musician tryouts.
Welcome to the Super Estrella Mystery Musician tryouts.
Today' s bands from all over will battle it out...... to the final stage of the competition.

What did she say?
She said five minutes.
Five times.
Is that 25 minutes?
Okay, you can take the 5 to the 110 to the....

So keep calling in.
Your votes and our judges' votes will be tabulated.
And up next, Las Ultrasónicas.
I' m gonna make them late.

- You look fabulous.
Mommy, you look beautiful.
Honestly.
Thank you, babies.
Kiss.
Kiss, kiss.
Enough of that.
You listen to your mom on the radio, okay?
No more food.
- Thank you.
I love you.
- Good luck!
- Here she comes.
Here she comes.
- Let me see.
You' re gorgeous.
That was Las Ultrasónicas.
It looks like you guys liked them.
Cartel de Santa is up next.
Where you guys been?
Come on.
Zorro, I' m sorry.
Traffic was terrible.
- Thanks.
You don' t think it' s too tight?
- No, no, no.
Looks terrific.
Let' s go.
What an amazing group.
Cartel de Santa.
Come on.
Come on.
Up next, All Star Gringo Star.
What' s the matter?
Come here.
- What' s the matter?
- What if they don' t get me out there?
What do you mean, what if they don' t get you?
What if I' ve been lying to myself and to everybody?
- What if they throw things at us?
- What?
Yeah, what if it just doesn' t work?
Listen to me.
You' ve got it.
This is gonna be terrific.
You' re ready for this.
This is your moment.
Enjoy it.
Okay?
Get ready.
Come on.
We worked really hard for this, given it everything we' ve got.
Now I want you to go out there, be brave, be bold and honest.
- Let' s go!
Go, go, go.
- Go on and have fun.
Hello, 818.
We' re El Gran Colectivo.
- Come on in.
- So is it hard being in a band?
You know, performing in front of all those people?
I usually do it in front of my family and friends...... but I guess there' s a first time for everything.
- Let' s not talk about it.
- You don' t want to jinx it.
- No.
No.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- No, you.
You.
- You.
You.
What are you gonna do with the...?
- How are you?
- Dr. Lopez!
- Good to see you.
- How you feeling?
- I feel terrific.
- You look terrific.
- How are you?
- Hey, how are you?
How have you been?
You see that?
Who' s that guy Nina' s with?
Some doctor.
Looks like someone' s got Nina' s attention.
Good for him.
What, you don' t care?
Not at all.
Make sure you don' t spill.
You don' t look like someone who doesn' t care.
I know I know you from somewhere.
Well, I live two blocks away from you.
- What' s your name?
- Beatriz.
- Yeah.
I see you almost every evening...... when I come back from work.
- How do I look?
- Fantastic.
Nina, will you help me make outfits for the band?
Sure.
Zorro, I don' t know, I don' t know.
Nina' s driving me crazy.
My mind' s on fire.
I don' t know what to do.
You' il be fine.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Yeah.
That' s me.
What can I do for you?
- We' re from Estrella Arts Management.
- Yeah?
We' d like to talk about your career.
We saw you play at the tryouts.
We think you' ve got potential.
Well, thank you.
That' s very nice of you to say.
There' s a great deal of talk lately from the major record labels...... about recruiting a fresh, new Latin talent.
A solo act to be the next big crossover.
- But I' m not a solo act.
- With our help, you could be huge.
Playing mainstream songs in English.
I don' t know, maybe you have the wrong guy.
- Maybe less ruffles.
- Okay.
I' il be right back.
- Will you start on the hem, hon?
- Of course.
You really do look gorgeous, you know?
It would look a lot better on you.
I' m too skinny.
Look at me.
I wish I could have some nice curves like you do.
I' m a stick.
Why do we worry about our bodies all the time?
We' re never satisfied, are we?
Yeah, and it' s usually just to please a man.
I' ve decided that I don' t need a man.
But there is...... someone that you' re crazy about, isn' t there?
Why do you say that?
I saw you and Antonio at the party.
I' m not ready to get serious with anyone.
Do you love him?
I don' t know.
He loves you.
Really?
Oh, I' m sure of it.
So, what we' re offering is to manage you...
- I know.
I understand that.
But I already have a manager.
Look, I know your manager, and he' s a really nice guy...... but he hasn' t been in the game for years.
He just can' t do for you what we can.
You know, Antonio, sometimes you just have to forget about the past.
This is a fast- paced industry.
If you don' t grab your chance when it comes around, you get left behind.
- Forgotten.
- Yesterday' s news.
I mean, to be honest with you...... it has always been my dream to just make an album.
I just want to have a CD, that' s all.
Well, better yet, how about a record deal?
You really think so?
You don' t think it' s too late?
I still have a chance?
We wouldn' t be here if we didn' t.
Well, look, I really gotta think it over.
Sure.
But don' t take too long.
This one is on us.
- I got it.
- Thank you.
I' il take it over there for you.
- Well, thank you for coming.
- Okay.
- It' s okay.
I mean, they' re not dirty, they' re just greasy.
- I' il be in touch, okay?
- Okay.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
This should be it.
- What' s up?
So you got a record deal, huh?
- Maybe.
- Well, good for you, man.
- Hey!
- Zorro, I' m so glad you' re here.
- I need to talk to you.
- Can we talk later?
We' re late.
Please, I gotta talk to you.
If you were me...... and all of a sudden you had opportunities you worked so hard for --
Opportunities?
When we' re done...... you' il have more than you ever know.
No, I know, but listen to me.
If you had to then make a choice between two things...
-... that you really wanted -- - Listen.
Let me tell you something.
This is the reason I became a manager to begin with...... to bring beautiful music to the world.
We' re gonna bring boleros back to life.
I' m excited about this.
Are you excited?
- Yes.
- Of course.
Come on.
- Let' s go inside.
Come on.
- Okay.
You look wonderful.
- I don' t look like I' m going to a funeral?
- No.
You look very handsome.
Thank you.
Don' t spill on your jackets.
No.
Oh, my goodness, she looks beautiful.
You look great!
We' re back with Pancho from All Star Gringo Star.
So are you excited about the finals?
Do you think you got a good chance?
Yeah, I think we do have a really good chance.
Now you told me earlier...... that the contest has generated so much publicity...... that there' s talk of record industry interest.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, not for us, unfortunately, just yet.
But I did hear that the lead singer from El Gran Colectivo...... is signing up with a new manager...... and is going solo right after the contest, so....
Imagine that.
So he' il be going out on his own?
Yes, the best of luck for him.
I' m sure your band will stay together...... and you guys are gonna do just fantastic, Pancho.
You are too kind.
Thank you very much.
- Antonio, we need to talk to you.
- What is this we hear in the news...... that you have a new deal with a new manager?
And that you' re going solo?
How could you do that to Zorro and Mirabela?
How could you do that to us?
- I thought what we had was good.
- I' m really sorry.
I should' ve told you what was going on.
- Yeah, what' s going on?
You know --
Because I keep things inside, and I should say what I' m feeling --
- Oh, please.
So it' s true.
- No, Mirabela, wait.
And let me tell you, it was really tempting, but --
Antonio, we' d be happy for you.
Just don' t do it behind our backs.
I turned it down.
Because -- Because we' re better all together.
Our music is all of us.
- Are you sure?
- Of course I' m sure.
Because I don' t have a big office downtown.
Who cares about a big office downtown?
Those big- office people never believed in me like you did.
And what happened to:
"You' re gonna bring the bolero back to the people"?
- What happened to that?
- Okay.
All right.
All right.
- Hi.
- Hey.
How are you?
- Guess what.
- What?
- I' m going to vet school.
- That' s great.
I' m so happy for you.
That' s everything you wanted, right?
It' s great.
I wanted to say I' m sorry.
Sorry for what?
I think I' ve been really stupid.
No, no, you had a lot going on.
You couldn' t help but be stupid.
I' m just kidding.
I mean, what' s important right now...... is that you become everything your mother said you should become.
But...... what about us?
What about us?
You think that...... maybe we can...... start again where we left off?
But why?
I mean, I don' t know how you feel about me.
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don' t.
Yes, you do.
You' re gonna go off to vet school...... find some vet and do some animal experiments.
Dissect animals and....
Thank you for shutting me up.
- I want you, Antonio.
- Really?
My name is Marco Mendez from Super Estrella...... and welcome to the Mystery Musician Contest.
Tonight, one lucky band is gonna be named the winner...... and will open for the mystery musician next week.
But that' s not all.
Because that band...... is gonna walk off with $10, 000 cash today.
So let' s settle back and give a big welcome to the band number one:
Zoé!
So...... how' s everybody feeling?
Have you seen how many people are out there?
- We' ve never competed before.
- Three hundred people.
They got nothing on you.
Nothing.
I' m not gonna lie to you, this is a big night.
But all those people out there...... they' re your friends, they' re your family, they' re your supporters...... they' re on your side.
This isn' t about competition.
You gotta forget about competing.
This is about doing what it is that you do.
And what is it that you do?
You play.
- Right.
Yeah.
- That' s right.
And you know what?
You' ve gotta love what you do.
They' il feel that.
I swear.
Trust me.
- All right, give it up for Zoé!
- Okay.
One, two, three, four.
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- What' s up?
I wanted to know, why did you do that to me on the radio?
Look, man, I....
This whole thing just got out of hand.
It' s....
I guess I wanted it all.
Maybe I was expecting too much, I don' t know.
Yeah, well, don' t expect too much and you won' t regret too much.
Okay, now give it up for All Star Gringo Star.
Come on.
One, two, three, four.
I' m just gonna take a little peek at the crowd.
Oh, no, no, no.
Don' t you dare.
Don' t let the crowd psych you out.
Mirabela.
Javier.
That bastard.
She' s so...... young.
So...... skinny.
I can' t.
I can' t.
Why?
What' s the matter?
- I can' t do it, okay?
- Why not?
No, you sing the song.
I told you not to let the crowd get to you, didn' t l?
He' s out there...
-... and he' s with her.
- Okay.
Okay, Mirabela, you' re not gonna give up everything...
-... because of one dumb guy, are you?
- Oh, God.
I' m not gonna let you do it, okay?
This means so much to you, and you mean so much to me.
I do?
Of course you do.
You made me believe in myself.
I did?
Absolutely.
Thank you.
Oh, it' s okay.
Is everything okay?
We' re on in, like, very soon.
We got a little situation.
Her ex is out there.
- That' s bad?
- Oh, yeah.
- Her ex is out there.
- So?
That' s bad.
Oh, right.
- Listen, he' s....
- A loser.
- Yeah.
A loser.
- A real loser.
If he did not know what a good thing he had when he was with you...... then he' il never find out.
That' s right.
Get up on that stage and show him what you' re made of.
Mirabela?
I don' t say much...... but you were born for this moment.
Now you get up there and you be fantastic for you.
- Right, for yourself.
- For yourself.
And now let' s give it up for El Gran Colectivo!
- Yeah.
Screw him.
- Yeah!
Let' s go, guys!
Hello.
Hello, Los Angeles.
We' re El Gran Colectivo...... and this next song is a pretty song...... that I want to dedicate to somebody very special to me.
Bravo.
Ladies and gentlemen, we' re gonna recount the votes...... and we' il be right back, so don' t go away.
I just want everyone to be ready for whatever happens...... because this is gonna be very, very close.
Okay.
Let' s just....
We' ve come this far, what if we don' t win?
It doesn' t matter.
We have the most important thing, right?
We have each other.
So come on, let' s toast to the winners.
- To the winners.
- To the winners.
- You' re right.
- Thank you.
Antonio' s right, because before this contest, I was solito...... and I met a beautiful girl and I have beautiful friends.
I love you guys.
You know, it' s true, if it wasn' t for this contest...... I never would' ve met you, Mirabela, my beautiful corazón.
What?
I' ve been crazy about you from the first moment I saw you.
I didn' t know you felt that way.
Thank you.
Allow me.
If you believe you' re a winner, then you are.
- Okay, then to the winners!
- To the winners.
- To the winners.
- To the winners.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the mystery musician:
El Señor José José!
Thank you very, very much.
I would like to introduce to you right now...... the winners of the Mystery Musician Contest:
El Gran Colectivo!
And now allow us to sing to you...... a very special song.
In the end, winning or losing didn' t matter.
Because together, we made something greater...... than if we each had stayed on our paths alone.
And isn' t that the beauty of life?
The love that we give and receive.
So see, my grandfather was right.
Our dreams are very powerful things.
We are going down.
Repeat, engines two and...
Mayday!
Andrew, this is your father.
Hello?
Look, you don' t call me back, so I don' t know how to do this.
If you' re not gonna return my calls... then there' s no way for us to communicate...
Look, I don' t know how to do this... but you' re gonna need to come home now.
Last night...
Your mother died last night, Andrew.
She drowned.
Last night, she drowned in the bath.

- I- In L. A., right?
- Yeah.
- That' s cool.
I hear that place is, like, fucking crazy.
My cousin' s a writer out there.
Says that place is mad crazy.
He' s, like, writing a movie about snowboarders or some shit.
I don' t know.
Um, but I should introduce you to him, Largeman.
Maybe you two could do something together.
Yeah, definitely.
What are you doing tonight, man?
No real plans.
I' m just in town for a couple days, so...
You should come out with us.
We' re gonna go over the Gleasons' house.
They' re having some... fucking huge party or something.
- Supposedly.
Supposedly.
- Really?
- He lives up on the hill.
We' il probably go over there after we bury your mom.
- Same.
What?
What?
Since I met her, she never showed an interest in anything.
All of a sudden, a month ago, she wakes up... she wants to redecorate a bathroom.
I helped her.
- Oh, must have been fun.
- Well, I sew.
That' s...
That' s good.
Thank you.
Will you try it on now?
Now?
In case I have to fix it before you leave again... and we don' t see you for another nine years.
I wanna make sure it fits.
You' re gonna love the material.
Gorgeous.
Hi.
- How you doing?
"Well, besides that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the show?"
You know, I' m not really sure what to say here, Dad, so I' m sorry.
How are you?
I' ve been getting these really bad headaches though.
Um, they' re really quick.
It' s like a... just a little lightning storm in my head.
Just for a second, and then it' s gone.
I just thought maybe you could help me get that checked out while I' m home.
Go see Dr. Cohen first thing in the morning.
He' s a neurologist in my building.
I' il call him.
He' il fit you in.
I' m sure it' s nothing to worry about.
Place looks good.
Oh, that' s nice.
Yeah, we' ve been doing a lot of work on it.
Really?
Actually, no.
I don' t know why I just said that.
I saw that.
That' s new.
I' m glad you' re here.
Saying good- bye is important.
I' m glad you could fit it in.
- Put your hands on your head, please.
- What?
Please.
Eighty- two in a 25.
What are you gonna tell me, you' re late or just tired?
- I was...
- Shut the fuck up!
- Largeman.
- Kenny?
Holy shit!
How you doing?
I' m great.
- Your mom just died!
- I know.
Yup.
You' re a cop, Kenny?
I know.
I don' t know.
Couldn' t think of anything better to do.
No, but it' s really cool though, man.
People really listen to you.
I mean... they have to!
- Yo, and check this shit out.
That' s the safety.
- Oh, cool.
And plus, the benefits, man.
If I get shot, I' m like... rich!
But, Kenny, the last time I saw you, you were doing coke lines off a urinal.
It' s time to grow up.
Plus, I wasn' t making shit in that fish market.
No one knew who I was, couldn' t get laid.
It' s a much better situation for me, man.
Speaking of which, um, how' d I do?
What do you mean?
You know, just the whole...
You mean, like, as a cop?
The whole, "Shut the fuck up!"
Well, I thought you were a dick, so I guess that' s good.
So, what the fuck, man?
I heard you did some... you played a big football player or something.
- I didn' t see it.
- It was just this thing...
- Fucking De Niro and shit.
- What?
- He' s awesome.
- Yeah.
- Deer Hunter?
- Yeah.
Man, we should sit down and we should talk... because I' ve got some really good ideas for movies.
You could play me and shit.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, definitely.
That sounds good.
- What' s up?
- How you doing, man?
- How you doing, man?
- Hey, how you doing?
Get this guy a beer.
This guy does not wait for a beer.
He' s a moviestar.
Like, uh, Jersey' s De Niro and shit.
- Largeman, man, what are you doing home?
Press junket.
Fuck, yeah!
Serpico and shit.
"Attica!"
Shut the fuck up, man.
You like that?
Like, uh, "press junket"?
That' s improv, bitch.
You can use it.
Okay.
Let me show you something.
What' s going on, man?
Hey!
How are you, brother?
- How' s it going, man?
I haven' t seen you in so long.
I heard you' re kicking ass.
Oh, um, basically the man bought my silent Velcro patent.
- I developed this little item.
It' s just like Velcro, but it doesn' t make that... the Velcro noise.
- So how much did they buy it for?
- A lot, man.
So wh- what are you doing with yourself?
Nothing.
Yeah.
I bought a whole bunch of shit.
Nothing.
Someone got a joint for me?
Oh.
No, thanks, man.
Really?
I thought you were a big movie star and shit.
- Nah.
- Well, then here.
Eat this.
Welcome home.
- I guess I' il see you guys later.
Should we play a game?
Let' s play "spin the bottle."
I' m not playing "spin the bottle."
- Or more importantly, how old are they?
I think.
Well, we just ate all this fucking "X," so what the hell else are we supposed to do?
Girl has a point.
- Fucking right.
- I' m in!
- Largeman, this is Dana.
- Hi.
Hi.
- This is gonna be a good night.
It' s good, isn' t it?
I always try to save a couple of the marshmallows till the very end... but I never make it.
I always end up with... a bunch of flake things and pink milk.
My mind wanders.
So, Tim...
How long have you been working at Medieval Times?
B- But I' ve only been a knight for two.
You have to pay your dues.
I worked in the stables and helped in the kitchen.
When I started, he was making the coleslaw.
It hasn' t been the same since you got knighted.
But I really just stirred it.
Don' t be modest.
Mr. Modesty won the joust last night.
- Congratulations.
- It' s not that big a deal.
What was it that happened to you in highschool?
I forgot what it was.
- He got the shit kicked out of him.
- No, he didn' t.
How do you know?
He got the shit kicked out of him by Tyrell Freedmen.
- I fucked him up too.
- He knocked your teeth out.
He only chipped one tooth.
So, uh, w- what are you up to now, Mark?
You' re digging graves?
Mark' s getting into real estate.
- Tim can speak Klingon.
- What?
- No, I can' t.
- Yes, you can.
- What the fuck is Klingon?
- Like the Star Trek guys?
- Yeah, he can speak their language.
- No, she' s kidding.
Why are you being shy?
- It' s just..
It' s made- up.
I don' t...
- Don' t be shy.
Tell them what you said to me last night.
Say what you said to her last night.
You gotta be kidding me.
It means, "I like to mate after battle."
- Yeah.
No.
That wasn' t the one I said.
This one means, "Kill Kirk"... and also "Hallelujah," depending on the context.
- Honey, that is good.
- You know what that means, Tim?
Well, I do.
It means, "Get the fuck out of my house... before I chop your fucking head off."
Mark, he' s a knight.
He' s just a fast- food knight.
I should get going.
Thanks, uh, for the cereal.
I had a lovely evening.
By the way, it says "balls" on your face.
- Asshole.
- My mom did it.
In the spring... the hungry gator must find new and clever ways to find food.
Did you tell Large about... the tapes?
I' m not doing those stupid tapes.
- What are the tapes?
- Real estate tapes.
You can make up to $100, 000 your first year.
You should have seen the boat this Oriental guy had.
He even had his own game show in China, he had so much money.
I think Mark would be perfect at it.
Ma, shut up about those fuckin 'tapes.
It' s a scam.
Well, I' m doing it.
I' m saving up for those tapes.
Because I know what you could be if you just apply yourself.
I do apply myself every day, Mom.
Okay?
What' s your rush for?
I don' t rush you.
Then I' il do 'em myself.
Do 'em.
Okay, then I won' t let you on my yacht.
Large, you can come anytime you want.
Just don' t bring your friend here.
Shit!
I got to go to my meeting.
Okay.
I love you.
- I love you too.
- I love you.
- Large, it was nice to see you.
Oh.
Oh, you guys, don' t stay in here all day...
'cause I took the batteries out of the carbon monoxide detector.
It was beeping all night.
She drives me crazy!
She gets all baked out and makes me feel like I have to impress her.
I' m okay with being unimpressive.
I sleep better.
- Hey, what time is it?
I gotta go.
- I' m really late for my appointment.
Okay, Andrew.
I' m gonna need you to fill out this paperwork for me.
As soon as we' re ready, we' il call you in.
I' m sorry.
Have a seat.
- Oh, hello there.
Just have a seat.
We' il be with you soon, okay?
- Thank you.
- You' re welcome.
How' s it going?
Get off.
- Heel.
Oh, what?
- You got any suggestions?
- Yeah, kick his balls.
Kick his balls.
Yeah, but I don' t wanna destroy future generations of charitable dogs.
Don' t worry about it.
I got three Dobermans.
If I didn' t kick them in the balls regularly, I' d never get anything done.
But he' s gotta be close to finishing by now.
Not yet.
Here comes the lipstick.
Mrs. Lubin?
We' re ready for you now.
Come on, Arthur.
- I feel so used.
- I recognize you.
- Oh, did you go to Columbia High?
From TV.
- Didn' t you play the retarded quarterback?
- Yeah.
Are you really retarded?
No, I' m not.
Cool.
Great job, man.
I mean, I thought you were really retarded.
You' re just as good as that Corky kid, and he' s actually retarded.
If there was some sort of retarded Oscar... you would win like hands down, kick his ass.
Well, thank you.
Thanks, I appreciate it.
I have to fill out this form though, so...
- Thanks.
My cousin' s an actor.
Jake Ryan Winters.
Doubt you' ve ever heard of him.
He was, like, on Xena once as a gnome or something.
That' s really cool though.
Thanks.
Oh, my God.
That last scene... where you give the speech to the whole stadium... and your dad... oh, your dad gives you the thumbs up.
Aw.
That was emotional.
No.
You know, I' m auditioning...
I can' t believe you' re not really retarded.
I mean, Jake' s not a very good actor.
You can' t really tell on Xena 'cause he' s in the hairy gnome suit... but when we were little, he used to put on these really, really low- budge... renditions of Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals in our attic.
And they were awful!
Like, so bad.
It sucks, though, because there' s not that much work for little people, you know?
- Anyway, I' m talking too much.
I' il just...
You got to fill out your forms.
What are you listening to?
The Shins.
- No.
You gotta hear this one song.
I swear.
You gotta fill out your forms.
Think you could, uh...
- maybe listen while you fill out your forms?
- I think I can handle it.
Yeah?
Okay.
I like it.
- So, what are you here for?
- What are you here for?
You?
I, uh...
Oh, fuck, that was nosy.
I didn' t...
I didn' t mean to be.
No, I just...
I just want to have it checked out.
Cool.
- Yes.
- We' re ready for you now.
- Oh, okay.
Nice meeting you.
I' m Sam.
Andrew.
Good luck with your head.
Thanks.
We' il be with you next.
- Mr. Andrew Largeman?
- Yes, hi.
- There' s absolutely nothing wrong with you.
Just kidding.
How would I know that?
I' m Dr. Cohen.
What can we do for you today, Andrew.
Um, I' ve been getting these really intense headaches.
Um, they last for like a split second.
It' s like lightning, like a surge of electricity, and then it' s gone.
Lithium?
How long have you been on the lithium?
Um, I' ve been on some form of it since I was 10 or so.
And the Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa...
Depakote... did they, uh, help you at all?
I mean, I don' t know.
Uh...
It' s recently occurred to me I might not even have a problem.
Only, I' d never know it because as far back as I can remember, I' ve been medicated.
I left them in L. A. Though.
This is, uh, the first time I haven' t had medicine in my body for... along time.
You know that stuff will leave your body pretty fast.
- I can write you a prescription.
- Actually, I was thinking about taking a little vacation.
Have you discussed this with your psychiatrist?
Uh, well, my psychiatrist is my dad.
So I think he' d prefer me to stay on it.
He... likes to think it makes me happy.
You know, our bodies are capable of doing some very funny things... when they' re consumed with stress and anxiety.
I found my ex- best friend' s cufflinks in my wife' s purse.
I couldn' t get an erection for a year and a half... for example.
I don' t really feel like stressed or anxious at all.
It' s amazing you can even hear me now.
I think you do need to find a psychiatrist that isn' t your father.
He knows better.
And secondly, uh, I' m in no position to comment on... whether you should stay on the meds or not because I don' t know your story.
But my opinion, since you' re paying for it... is that, yeah, those drugs may help you as means to an end... but sooner or later, if you' re not in some sort of therapy... whatever' s going on in your mind will find a way to peek its little head out of the water.
- Yeah.
Yeah, you' re all right.
You' re alive.
Come on.
Come.
I' il need you to take your shoes off.
I have to scratch your feet.
So why were you really there?
I' m a robot.
- Do you lie a lot?
- What do you consider a lot?
Enough for people to call you a liar.
- People call me lots of things.
- Is one of them "liar"?
I could say no, but how would you know I' m not lyin '?
I guess I could choose to trust you.
- You can do that?
- I can try.
Whose bike is that?
It was my grandfather' s.
It was the only thing he left to anyone in my family, and he left it to me.
And I like it.
So this is the point in the conversation where you ask me if I’ d like a ride home.
- Yep.
Would you like a ride home?
- Why not?
- Sidecars are for bitches.
Anyone who rides in that is automatically your bitch.
Thus, I will ride on the back.
Okay.
Holdin '.
My hair is blowin 'in the wind.
What, are you like a hang glider?
- What does he have?
No.
Goes way faster than this guy.
- But what kind of helmet is that?
- You can wear it on a bike.
- Anyway, how' s your head?
- I should live through the day.
Make a right here.
Are you doing anything right now?
- Can you elaborate on "doing anything"?
He bought this mansion that' s right up here... and he wants me to come visit him.
But I don' t want to stay very long.
I could just say I have to take you home when I' m ready to go.
- I know.
- "Nice to meet you.
- No.
No.
It' s not like that.
It' il be fun.
like a signal.
Like, when you pull on your ear, that' s the code.
And then I' il be like, "Oh, I got to take her home." And then we' il go.
Can we have code names too?
Okay.
But don' t try and like kidnap me or anything...
'cause my step- uncle' s a bounty hunter and he could have you tracked and killed.
You' re such a liar.
You ready?
No.
I lied to you before when I told you my boyfriend drives a Ninja.
- No, I don' t have a boyfriend.
But, you know, he might drive a Ninja.
Okay.
So...
So sometimes I lie.
I mean, I' m weird, man.
It' s like...
It' s like a tic.
I mean, sometimes I hear myself say something, and then I think...
So how do people know what' s real?
Well, I always feel bad afterwards and admit them when they' re lies.
Open the door.
Mom!
Come on.
Kick him in the balls.
Mom!
Everybody down!
Who wants to eat?
Do you want to eat?
Then get the fuck off him.
Kevin!
We just don' t have the time to train them.
Who' s got the time to train them?
- Mom, this is Andrew.
Welcome.
I' m sorry the place is a wreck.
- I forgot.
- Well, you forgot and now Jelly' s dead.
Luckily, I got Peanut Butter out in time.
We have to get the only hamsters on planet Earth... who can' t figure out a stupid hamsterwheel.
There' s a tin box on the kitchen counter.
You can do the honors.
I have to get to work.
- Yes.
Very nice to meet you.
Samantha, put the clothes in the dryer and bury Jelly.
So this is it.
- No, it' s not.
Don' t say that just 'cause you can' t think of anything else.
It' s very cozy.
Yeah, we never got around to taking it down.
When it got to be fall again... we figured, "Just leave it up."
You' re totally freaked out.
You' re totally freaked out right now.
I' m not.
- It' s very nice.
Sure.
Andrew, this is my brother, Titembay.
It' s very nice to meet you.
- Oh, it' s nice to meet you.
- I' m sorry about Jelly.
- Oh, that' s okay.
It' s in the fridge.
Thank you.
It' s nice meeting you.
- Very nice to meet you.
- See you later.
So here we are.
What?
Yeah, it' s weird, huh?
You' re, like, so freaked out right now.
You' re running for the door.
Don' t feel bad.
- Stop doing that.
- What?
The whole thing you just did.
If I didn' t, I wouldn' t be.
Okay?
Okay.
So, Titembay.
- Yeah, he' s my brother.
Kind of.
My mom adopted him from Sally Struthers like years ago.
One of those "For the cost of a cup of coffee a day" sort of things.
Where she' s like, "How can you just sit there and not help the children?"
We just couldn' t sit there and not help the children.
So we start sending him like pictures and letters and stuff for years... but then I got really into ice- skating, so we sort of forgot about him.
Then one day we get this phone call and it' s Titembay.
And he' s like, "I' m at Rutgers.
I live in the dorms... but I' m used to living with my tribe so I' d rather live with a family. "
And he' s been living with us ever since.
Yeah.
He' s the most amazing guy.
You gotta hear his stories.
He struggled through so much because he wanted to learn.
You know?
He' s studying criminal justice at Rutgers, and when he was a baby... he was one of those kids with, like, the flies all over his face.
Yeah, I know.
I mean, that' s a true story.
I am not that good.
This is Tickle.
- What is Tickle?
- Tickle' s my favorite thing in the whole world.
It' s all that' s left of Nanny, my blanket.
- Mm- hmm.
- Was there like a hurricane or something?
- Shut up.
No, I mean, I' ve had this since I was a baby.
It' s what they brought me home in from the hospital.
- It' s like the Wailing Wall.
- What?
Uh, the Wailing Wall is like this, uh...
It' s like the most holy place for Jews to go and pray in Israel.
It' s all that' s left of this enormous temple that was destroyed by the Romans.
So you' re like really Jewish.
- What?
- You are.
I’ m Jewish, but I' m not really Jewish.
I don' t do anything Jewish.
But I don' t know any Jews that go to temple.
- It' s Yom Kippur, the Day of Repentance.
- Okay.
Did you know that most temples are built with moveable walls... so that on the one day of the year when everyone comes to repent... they can actually make the room big enough to hold everyone?
I don' t really believe in God.
- Just Tickle.
- Oh, I believe in Tickle.
- What?
I' m sorry.
- No, no.
- It' s just that we' re not gonna make out, okay?
- Oh, no, I hadn' t planned on trying...
I am so lame.
I am...
I am...
And...
- You know what I do when I feel completely unoriginal?
- What?
And then I can feel unique again even if it' s only for like a second.
So, no one' s ever done that?
No.
- It' s refreshing.
- Oh, no.
- No, come on.
- I think that was good enough for both of us.
What are you, shy?
This is your one opportunity to do something... that no one has done before and that no one will copy again throughout human existence.
This one thing.
Oh, I' ve done that one before.
- So, uh...
I gotta go bury this hamster before the dogs eat him.
Hmm?
- Yeah.
- I mean, this is, uh...
- I know.
It' s not that we' re bad pet owners or anything.
It' s just, you know, we' ve had so many of them over the years.
Besides, a lot of these are fish.
After you.
All right.
Sit down.
What are you thinking about?
- Yeah.
- Right now?
Right now, I was thinking I' ve been going to a lot of these things lately.
- What, dates?
- Not dates.
Is this a date?
This isn' t a date.
Why?
Who else died?
I guess I haven' t even told you that yet.
Um...
My mom just died.
God, that' s weird to say that out loud, but, uh...
Yeah, that' s why I' m home.
I' m so sorry.
God, I' m so sorry.
And here I am, like, putting you through another one of these.
I mean, we loved Jelly but...
No, it' s okay.
It' s all right.
I' m all right with it.
Anyway, I think it' s what she wanted, so...
How' d she die?
She drowned actually.
My mother was a paraplegic.
She was in a wheelchair so she, uh...
I guess she was taking a bath... and she must have slipped or something.
That' s what they say.
I don' t know.
But... needless to say, she drowned and... that' s how she... sh- she died.
When?
This was, uh...
Sunday.
Oh, my God.
Why are you crying?
I' m sorry.
It' s just like...
It' s just so sad.
You know, it' s like...
It is.
It' s like real life tragedy or something.
Anyway, let' s change the subject, okay?
Let' s really bring the focus back to Jelly...
'cause what could be ruder than talking about someone else who died... when you' re in the act of burying a close friend?
- I don' t know.
I' ve only been to one of these things.
You appear to be the expert.
Well, we usually say something.
Um...
From what I hear, you were a good pet.
- That' s not funny.
Jelly, you were a great pet.
I' m sorry I forgot to take the wheel out of your cage.
I' m so, so sorry about that.
Good- bye.
I hope that you liked me.
You scared the shit out of me.
- Why are you always doing that?
I know.
I' ve been catching up with people around here.
Dr. Cohen called.
There' s nothing wrong with you.
Yeah, I think I' m starting to figure that out myself.
- Uh, probably tomorrow.
Um, you know, I got a lot of stuff I got to take care of in L. A.
- We need to talk.
Yeah, uh, how?
I mean, when?
What are you doing... now?
I told my friend Mark I was gonna meet up with him.
- Okay.
Then we' il talk.
- Yeah.
We owe that to each other.
Yeah.
We owe it to her.
Yeah.
Good.
Sorry I scared you.
How could you leave all that lithium?
I was totally going to hit you up for some, man.
I' m glad you' re back, man.
This town is so messed up.
Everyone' s got their drug of choice.
You ever read that book?
Who wrote that?
Um, Aldous...
Aldous, uh...
Anyway... there' s like Alphas and Betas and Epsilons and all sorts of people.
Huxtable.
That' s it, bro.
- Mom, no.
- Absolutely.
She was so ahead of her time.
No, no, no, no.
Yes, you could have.
- You had a gift.
Let me see it.
The gator costume.
- Mom, I' m asking you, seriously.
Let me see it!
Oh, she wants you to see it.
How could you not want him to see how talented you are?
- Were.
- Come on.
- Ohh!
- Honey, what are you doing?
- I' m dusting for prints.
Well, could we move the crime scene into the kitchen?
I want to show Andrew Sam' s skating.
But someone' s been pissing on my GameCube, and I' m about to close the case.
It wasn' t me, Your Honor.
Andrew, come on.
Sit down here on the couch.
I can' t believe you' re actually showing him this.
Look, there she is.
- You' re the alligator?
- You can tell by the hands.
- Here comes the double axel.
Oh, I mean, come on.
Is she good?
- Wow, she' s great.
- All right.
- Shut up.
- No, I mean, your mom was right.
You' re really good.
- All right.
- Just wanted to show how talented you are.
My baby!
All right, go on!
Get away.
Gimme a hug.
I love you so much.
- I love you too.
- Have a good night.
- Come on!
- Mom!
Come on.
- I' il take a hug.
- Good night.
See you later, Tim.
- Bye, Tim.
I don' t know.
Pretending to be someone else.
- That is not funny.
Oh, come on.
You gotta see that' s a joke.
If you can' t laugh at yourself, life' s gonna seem a whole lot longer than you' d like.
Mm.
I lied again.
- I have epilepsy.
I, um...
I had a seizure at the law office where I work.
And they told me their insurance wouldn' t cover me unless I wore preventative covering.
- What' s preventative covering?
- The helmet I was wearing.
That' s really funny.
Well, what do you do?
Their insurance is amazing.
You laugh, you know?
I' m not saying I don' t cry.
But in- between, I laugh.
And I realize how silly it is to take anything too seriously.
Plus, I look forward to a good cry.
Feels pretty good.
I haven' t cried since I was a little kid.
I didn' t cry at my mother' s funeral.
I tried, you know?
Like, things in movies, this...
But nothing came.
That actually made me sadder than anything... the fact that I just felt so numb.
- Just that...
Hey, Vagina!
Hey, what' s up, guys?
- Hey.
- What' s up?
I' m sorry I said "vagina" just now.
- I didn' t know you were here.
- Nice.
Let' s get fucked up.
Whoo!
- What are you doing?
- Largeman, get the fuck in the pool!
- It' s so warm!
Can' t you swim?
Of course I can swim.
I don' t know C. P. R.
- You look like a wet beaver.
There' s handful of normal kid things I kind of missed.
There' s a handful of normal kid things I kind of wish I' d missed.
You know that point in your life when you realize the house you grew up in... isn' t really your home anymore.
All of a sudden, even though you have some place where you put your shit... that idea of home is gone.
I still feel at home in my house.
You' il see one day when you move out.
Just sorta happens one day, and it' s gone.
You feel like you can never get it back.
It' s like you feel homesick for a place that doesn' t even exist.
Maybe it' s like this rite of passage, you know?
You know, for...
For the family you start.
It' s like a cycle or something.
But I miss the idea of it, you know?
Maybe that' s all family really is.
A group of people that miss the same imaginary place.
Maybe.
How about some fuckin 'furniture, dude?
- Where is it?
- It' s keeping us warm.
- Silent Velcro.
- You lucky motherfucker.
I feel like if I had showed up at school and presented the idea of silent Velcro... they would have sent me away a whole lot sooner.
Listen to this girl.
- They didn' t "send me away."
- You just said they sent you away.
I mean, they sent me away.
They sent me to boarding school.
- There were no straps involved.
- Why did they send you to boarding school?
"Oh, are you freaked out?
- You can go.
- That' s really funny.
- It' s really funny.
Why would they think you' d be dangerous?
- Want to know?
- Yeah.
- You' re gay.
Drum roll.
I was the reason she was in a wheelchair.
I pushed her.
So there that is.
- Fuck off.
- No.
That' s the truth.
- Why?
It was just a complete freak accident, you know?
It' s one of those things you replay a million times in your head... and you see how clearly it was just a complete freak thing.
My- My whole life, she was depressed for no reason.
I was nine years old... and I just hated her for that.
And it was innocent.
I was just completely frustrated.
- 'Cause...
Fuck, yeah!
And any other time, you know... any other day, she would have just yelled at me and sent me to my room.
But this day... on this particular day... the door of the dishwasher... had fallen open... the latch on it was broken.
And it would just randomly fall open.
That fuckin 'latch, you know.
But...
- Wow.
- Still want to compare fucked- up families?
Yeah.
Well, I was nine.
So they sent me to therapy and put me on these drugs... that were supposed to "curb my anger," and I' ve been on some form of them ever since.
And when I was 16, my psychiatrist dad came around to the conclusion that... it probably wasn' t the best environment for me to be growing up in, so... he sent me to boarding school.
- For her funeral.
- Till now for her funeral.
- Jesse?
Where' s the sauna?
- No, I- I got it.
- No, you get her a towel.
Want a ride, sweetheart?
- What do you mean?
- My mom always says that when she can see...
I' m, like, working something out in my head, she' s like, "You' re in it right now."
And I' m lookin 'at you, and you' re... telling me that story, and... you' re definitely in it right now.
I am in it.
Let' s just...
- Good stuff?
- Yeah, like "glass half- full" shit.
- What do you got?
Got that.
- I got a little buzz goin '.
And I like you.
I guess I have that.
You want to see me tap- dance?
I would love to see you tap- dance.
- What are you doing?
Fuck yeah.
Those things are collector' s items, man.
- Hell, yeah.
That' s just like an investment.
I have lots of little investments all over the place.
One day I' m gonna sell all of 'em just fuckin' live off of it.
- Which?
- "Night Vision Goggles."
Mint?
- Dollars?
- Yeah.
It' s too early.
Don' t you know anything about investing?
I' m gonna live off that shit.
If you have a complete set, it' s worth, like, thousands.
- So do you have the complete set?
- Almost.
The corners are bent on my "Friendly Fire," and someone stole my "Wolf Blitzer."
'Cause, uh...
I got you a little going- away present... but, uh, I gotta kind of track it down first.
- Uh, yeah.
- What?
- No, nothin '.
Say it.
Speak.
- She can come.
I don' t care.
I really don' t want to be in Handi- World.
We' re getting money for your present.
Don' t look so guilty.
- How do I look guilty?
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.
- Who is that?
- Just don' t give him your number.
Hey, man.
- Holy shit!
- How' s it goin '?
- I haven' t seen you since, like, junior year.
- I thought you killed yourself.
I thought you killed yourself.
- No, no.
- Who killed themselves?
- That was the Gleason kid.
- Tina who?
- You remember Tina.
- She was anorexic, did gymnastics...
- How' d she do it?
- I don' t know.
She wasn' t Jewish.
I think it was sleeping pills.
Or that car in the garage thing.
I forgot.
- Hey.
- Uh, you two stay here.
I' il be right back.
Okay.
- Hey, weren' t you on a TV show or something?
- Yeah, it was just this show.
That' s cool.
Only for a little while.
I' m opening my own business.
Actually, I should talk to you about it.
I' m lookin 'for smart people like you, Large.
- I should get your number.
That' d be cool.
I' d like to talk to you... both... about a good opportunity for you and your loved ones.
I know I do!
I' d like to talk to you about an exciting opportunity that people are talking about.
It was good to see you, Karl.
- Hey, I should get your number.
- Yeah, definitely.
Well, I' il call you because I think he has it in his book.
Nice to meet you.
Why is it always the losers that get caught up in the pyramid schemes?
- Is that what he' s doin '?
- Yeah.
Why are you buying knives?
I don' t need knives.
- I' d like to return these.
- Actually, no.
They' re a gift.
- Why are you returning these?
- They' re not sharp enough?
No.
Not for what we need them for.
- They couldn' t cut cans.
- You bought them to cut cans?
No, but in the commercial, it said if I wanted to cut cans, I could.
- It comes with a sharpener.
- Did you try it?
- Yeah.
- I don' t want them.
They' re not sharp enough.
A major loophole in the Handi- World return policy is that they permit returns... without receipts on items below $40.
So, how often do you go?
I hit every employee once, and then I wait until they hire new ones.
- Except for Karl Benson.
- You know, Mark, it' s my last day in town.
- I don' t need your money.
- Fuck, take Jesse' s.
The guy' s a millionaire.
I don' t take anybody' s money.
Favors are bad news.
Let' s go.
I gotta see a guy about a nitrous tank.
- What is this place?
I think you can see into the hotelrooms.
Oh, yeah!
I' m gonna fuckin 'cum!
That shit was hot.
I gotta go drop some knowledge on that ho right there.
How do you know she' s a hooker?
Of course she' s a fuckin 'hooker.
Girls who look like her do not fuck guys that look like him... unless it' s for coke, money or fame.
Well, Julia Roberts married Lyle Lovett.
- This is Sam.
No offense, man.
But why are you bringing these fuckin 'people here?
Wait.
Okay?
- Could you just tell us where to go now?
- That thing come with balloons?
No.
Suck it off the tap.
And I need it back when you' re done...
- All right.
Hold up!
Who here just saw some titties?
Raise you hand if you just saw some titties.
So everybody just calm the fuck down!
You know where Kiernan' s Quarry is?
- Yeah.
It 'sat the bottom of Hillside and Rivington.
You can' t really see it from the street, but it' s there.
Park your car at the gate and hop the fence.
Albert.
All right?
Okay, stop.
What the fuck are we doin '?
- Just be patient, man.
- We' ve been patient all day... but it' s my last day and you haven' t told us what we' re doin '.
If you told me we were going on a six- hour hunt for blow, I would' ve passed.
We would have been rolling five hours ago.
- I' m not innocent!
All right?
That' s what I like about you.
Wow.
That' s like the most worked- up I' ve ever seen you.
- So?
- He likes me.
- Don' t be cute.
He' s my knight in shining armor.
It' s a sore subject.
- Pun intended?
- Oh, you' re fuckin '...
- Wow!
I' ve heard about it.
Yeah.
I remember reading about that in the paper, that they were... digging or something, and they break into this natural phenomenon.
It' s like an underground Grand Canyon or something.
Now they' re in some huge legal battle over whether they can build here or not.
- on some, like, geological phenomenon?
They love their malls here, man.
Let' s find this guy and get out of here.
- You' re not gonna tell us what we' re getting?
You' il see.
- I think it' s gonna rain.
So this is it.
Knock and barter for Desert Storm trading cards.
I don' t tease you about being an asshole.
Okay!
Albert?
Come on in.
You guys must be freezing.
Make yourselves warm by the fire.
I' il be right back out.
- continues to be weirder and weirder.
- What do you mean?
This is nice.
Oh, nothing.
Just hangin 'out on an old boat at the bottom of a quarry in Newark.
It' s hardly the bottom, dude.
Hey!
Hi!
Have a seat.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Man, it' s really comin 'down out there.
- It just started pouring all of a sudden.
- Well... in a bad storm, I like to pretend that this old boat' s my own private ark.
- I' m not quite sure it still floats.
- I' d love some.
- Do you want some?
I' il be right back.
What is it that you do down here?
Well, we' re calling it Kiernan' s Fault.
It' s, uh...
No one really knows what it is because we haven' t been able to explore it.
- to make sure no one comes inside.
But what they don' t know is that at night I climb down.
Thank you.
You know...
No one really knows.
But I like to pretend it' s infinite.
It' s kind of an odd job.
- Yeah.
Yeah, I guess it is.
But we also trade and deal in antique jewelry.
- No.
- Not at all. - Never crossed my mind.
Well, we think it' s important.
What is it that you think you' re gonna find?
- "Albert' s Abyss."
- Well, maybe.
Who knows?
But, you know what?
None of that really matters.
If I get to be with this person right here... and our beautiful baby... that' s all I need.
Oh, yeah.
That' d be great.
It took me a while to track this piece down... but I owed Diego huge.
Thank you so much.
- Yeah.
- Really.
Um, do you guys want some garbage bags or something?
- Okay.
That' d be great.
- Hey, Albert!
- Yeah?
Thank you.
Hey!
You too.
So, uh, I don' t know if I' m gonna see you, man.
Don' t you want to know what' s in the bag?
To be honest, I don' t even care anymore.
What is it?
It' s my mom' s favorite necklace.
But...
I got it back to you, right?
That' s gotta be worth something.
This whole day was about this?
You didn' t want it down there with her.
It' s better it' s with you.
Okay.
If you ever need a Kato, you know where to find me.
This, uh...
This necklace reminds me of this really random memory of my mother.
And, uh...
She was just like, you know, cradling me and rocking me back and forth.
And, uh...
And there was just, like, snot dripping down my nose, right?
She gave me her sleeve... and she told me to blow my nose into it.
And I remember thinking, even as a little kid, like...
"Wow!
This is love. "
Large?
- Yeah, I do.
Wait, wait.
We should save it or something.
Okay.
- That it?
I don' t really feel any more coming.
Well, if you do, just let me know.
I' il get the cup, okay?
- Who are you?
- I' m your new friend Sam.
- Tissue?
Come here.
Yeah, I know.
If nothing else, that' s life, you know.
It' s real.
Sometimes it fuckin 'hurts.
To be honest, it' s sort of all we have.
How are you feelin '?
Safe.
When I' m with you, I feel so safe.
Like I' m home.
- Dad.
- I' m sorry I woke you up.
No, I was just reading.
Where have you been?
Everywhere.
You' ve been avoiding me.
No, I haven' t been.
Come on.
Okay, maybe I have been.
I' m sure you can find lots of things in your life... that you can be angry about.
But what I do not understand is why you' re so angry at me.
- That' s all I ever wanted.
- When were we all ever happy, Dad?
You always say that, but when was that?
When was this time that we were all so happy?
'Cause I don' t have it in my memory.
Maybe if I did, I could help steer us back there.
But I just...
You know, you and I need to work on being okay... if that' s not in the cards for us.
Well, we might have a shot at it... if you can forgive yourself for what you did.
Okay, let' s- let' s do it.
Okay, we' re here, right?
Le- Let' s do it!
Are you ready?
I was a little boy, and somebody made a shitty latch.
And I' m not gonna take those drugs anymore.
They left me completely fuckin 'numb.
I have felt so fucking numb to everything I have experienced in my life, okay?
And for that...
For that, I' m here to forgive you.
You always said all you wanted was for us to have whatever it is we wanted.
Maybe what Mom wanted more than anything was for it to all be over.
Even if it' s pain.
Well, you' re going against your doctor' s recommendation.
That' s a pretty weighty experiment to take on, don' t you think?
This is my life, Dad.
I spent 26 years waiting for something else to start.
I see now it' s all there is.
You know that, right?
We may not be as happy as you always dreamed we would be, but...
for the first time, let' s just allow ourselves to be whatever it is we are.
And that' il be better, okay?
I think that' il be better.
What are you thinking about?
- Come on, Sam.
- No, you' re not.
You don' t realize this is good.
I mean, this...
We can work this stuff out.
We need each other.
I haven' t even lied in, like, two days.
Is that true?
- No.
It' s...
I' m not puttin 'a period at the end of this, you know?
I' m puttin ', like, an ellipsis on it.
Because I' m- I' m worried that if I don' t go figure myself out... if I don' t go, like, land on my own two feet... then I' m gonna fuck this whole thing up, and this is too important.
Gotta go.
I gotta go find a new one.
Look, I' m gonna call you when I get there.
I' m gonna call you.
Look at me.
Look at me.
You changed my life.
You changed my life, and I' ve known you four days.
This is the beginning of something really big.
But right now, I gotta go.
Come here.
Take your seats as quickly as possible.
- Remember that idea I had about working stuff out on my own...
Yeah.
It' s dumb.
It' s an awful idea.
'Cause like you said, this is it.
This is life... and I' m in love with you, Samantha.
I think that' s the only thing I' ve ever been really sure of in my entire life.
- Yeah.
- And I think I can do this!
I mean, I want to.
- We have to, right?
- Right?
- Yes!
So what do we do?
What do we do?
Buck Rogers in the 20th century!
Buck Rogers, now adventuring in the amazing world of the 20th century.
By turning the dial to project us ahead in time...... we' re able to be with Buck and friends in the wonderful world of the future.
A world that sees a lot of our scientific and mechanical dreams come true.
You know, there' s nothing supernatural or mystic about Buck.
He' s just an ordinary, normal human being who keeps his wits about him.
- What' s wrong?
- Nothing, nothing really.
I just feel that I need something stronger.
If you have a problem, don 't hesitate to ask for assistance.
- Yes, thank you, I' il be all right.
- Call 348- FUN --
What' s wrong?
Never mind.
Never mind.

Should be 1 239, 1 239.
All right, watch it.
You' re gonna override again.
Bring it down.
You' re right next to it.
- That' s right.
- What' s wrong?
I just bought one of these yesterday and it doesn 't fit my consumer...... and the store doesn' t have the other kind.
For more enjoyment and greater efficiency...... consumption is being standardized.
- This is --
A ttention all stations, I have a temporary blockage...... affecting a Red Section module.

All is one.
Masses are what we are.
We are the masses.
But all in all, we are masses.
For the Party and for all, masses are what we are.
Very good.
Proceed.
Well...... I slipped...... on a thermal transfer this morning.
It' s never happened before.
I wasn' t concentrating enough.
Yes, I understand.
Things haven' t been...
-... going well.
- Yes, fine.
How could I be so wrong?
My mate...... has been acting very strange.
I can' t explain it.
- Yes.
- I haven' t been feeling very well myself.
- Yes, I understand.
- I don' t know, maybe it' s me.
Yes, fine.
I needed some pinural last night.
- I feel as if something...
- Excellent.... odd were happening to me.
- Something that...
- Yes? -... I can' t understand.
- Could you be more...... specific?
The sedatives.
I' m taking etracene, but it doesn' t seem strong enough.
I have a hard time concentrating.
You are a true believer.
Blessings of the state.
- Please, forgive me.
- Blessings of the masses.
Thou art a subject of the divine, created in the image of man...... by the masses, for the masses.
Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.
Work hard.
Increase production.
Prevent accidents.
And...... be happy.
If it will make you happy, just this once.
Now, be careful, it 's heavy.
THX?
THX?
THX?
Is that you?
We are sorry, but we must deny your request.
Birthborns are not allowed more than 5 units of enerval.
Substitution of enerval for etracene...... may cause a serious chemical imbalance.
Thank you.
Never before have we been so contented.
Never.
A dragon sounds like this when --
-- nine units of detuned escalatories have not, however...... prevented virus and ordnance from invading our centers.
The three recently elected representatives from Con 9 have again resigned...
-... and returned to their sectors.
- You ought to eat.
Five felons were caught fleeing rehabilitation center DD2.
All five have been undergoing treatment for drug offenses.
- Where did you get this car?
- I was just issued it.
I took it for a test drive and ran straight through a crowd at the dispersal center.
Oh, terrible.
Terrible.
No.
No, it was wonderful.
Because I didn 't hit anyone, just an 1 1 14.
What' s this?
Why did you change it?
- You' ve seen enough.
- Well, that' s wonderful.
- No, it' s terrible.
- You know I don' t feel well.
- Take your sedation.
- That is terrible, just terrible.
No, it was wonderful, wonderful.
Because my hand, it was paralyzed anyway.
That was very funny.
Remember, an enerval overdose may cause a serious chemical imbalance.
My time is yours.
Go ahead.
What 's wrong with me?
What am I to her or she to me?
Nothing.
- Yes, fine.
- She 's an ordinary roommate.
I share rooms with her.
- Our relationship is normal, conforming.
- Excellent.
We share nothing...... but space.
What is she doing to me?
Yes, I understand.
I think I' m dying.
Could you be more...... specific?
You are a true believer.
Blessings of the state.
Blessings of the masses.
Thou art a subject of the divine, created in the image of man...... by the masses, for the masses.
Let us be thankful we have commerce.
Buy more.
Buy more now.
Buy...... and be happy.
What' s wrong?
What' s wrong?
What' s wrong?
What' s wrong?
What' s wrong?
What' s wrong?
What' s wrong?
- What' s wrong?
- Never mind.
I was so afraid.
So alone.
I wanted to touch you...... so many times.
I was happy.
Why get me involved?
They know.
They' ve been watching us.
I can feel it.
No one knows.
They' re watching us now.
No one can see us.
I can...... feel it.
Twenty- four.
Twenty- three.
Twenty- two.
6442, gate five, please.
We' ve got a malfunctioning officer in corridor 7A.
All right, just a minute.
Standby, scope 1.
If you go back on sedation, you won' t feel the same way about me.
You' il report me for drug violation.
I' ve got a slip movement to install on my next shift.
I' il never make it the way I am now.
I wouldn' t turn you in, not now.
- You don' t -- - I know I wouldn' t.
You can do it without etracene.
- You can.
I know you can.
- Then what?
It can' t go on forever, you know it can' t.
We could leave.
And live in the superstructure.
You only have one more shift left, don' t you?
We could be gone before the next series started.
It' s all right.
- It' s all right.
What' s this?
I have to see SEN.
I' ve just been given a shift change.
- When?
- Now.
- Now?
- He wants me to come to his quarters.
A shift change should come through scheduling.
Why should he want to see you?
I don' t know.
- Don' t go.
- I have to.
He' s a G34.
You don' t have to.
I don' t trust him.
You ought to file a report.
No.
Don' t make trouble.
It' s nothing.
Then why did you bring it up?
I didn' t.
You asked me about the card.
You' re going to get us into trouble.
Do not push or shove at the fountain.
It' s more work for the cleaning detail.
- Did you copy that?
- The android, the hung- over writing.
Is he getting that?
Is he copying me?
This is borough- flow submaster.
Control, have you got that code yet?
I read you very badly.
I' il check the message....
- Twenty- three hunter portapods.
- lt 's you.
- Come in, come in.
Sit down.
You know, this is really odd.
I was just thinking about you.
I must apologize for all this chaos.
They moved in this morning...... and it' s been going on all day.
The roommate was destroyed, you know.
Terrible inconvenience.
Have to try to see things in perspective, do what you can...... to make things...... fit.
I can accept things up to a point.
But if you get a chance...... to make...... adjustments...... you' re very foolish to pass them up.
Where is LUH?
- What?
- Your card, please.
Thank you.
This monitor is to be used for emergencies or special requests only.
All routine information can easily be obtained...... through the bulletin panels installed at --
Why did you have LUH come here?
Why are you so concerned?
What' s going on?
I want you for my roommate.
We' il be very good for one another.
I don' t understand.
Living --
Living selection is computed.
I know what you' re thinking.
Program- shifting isn' t that major a crime, is it?
You' re in violation.
Don' t say that.
What have you done to LUH?
She was here.
We...... had a long talk.
And she agreed that it would be better for both of you to switch.
She seemed to think that you weren' t accurately mated with her in the first place.
I' il never have another mate like ONA.
You rate very high in sanitation.
I' ve checked.

3927, could you get him from where you are?
THX 1 1 38.
Hi.
I know you turned me in.
I' m doing quite well here anyway.
I' m setting some things up...... but it isn' t easy.
A very difficult balance, you know?
Now, let' s get something straight right from the start.
It' s gonna take you some time to see my overall plan.
So until then, stay out of things you don' t understand, right?
You' re gonna be making things more difficult for me.
It' s the least you can do.
What' s wrong with you?
- Don' t be like that.
- It' s all right.
You' re safe now.
When posterity judges our actions here...... it will perhaps see us not as unwilling prisoners...... but as men who, for whatever reason...... preferred to remain as non- contributing individuals on the edge of society.
- We must not let this happen.
- Countless diversions.
- Gentlemen, the choice is there.
- Reciting where we are.
- Arguing about leaving.
- Make no mistake.
- Predicting the future.
Ridiculous.
- We must choose a leader...
- What about keeping things livable here? -... to unite us.
- LUH 9998.
- LUH?
What happened?
Who' s gone?
- JOT.
Yes, CAM, that' s it.
Your point is well taken, CAM...... but it lacks the balance that a broader and deeper range of experience can lend it.
When I first arrived here, I saw things as perhaps you do now.
Yes, I was confused about my predicament.
I longed to thrash out, to tear down, to destroy and annihilate...... to ravage, wreak havoc and plunder.
Being basically levelheaded, however...... I realized that my first goal should be to study this place...... where what seemed blind circumstance had placed me.
Listen to the mumblings of an old man...... and bank those flames with earnest inquiry and honest observation.
"Mumblings."
"Mumblings," you hear?
Know how many times we' ve listened to that speech?
Do you know how many times we' ve had to listen to that speech?
Thinks we' re as blind as him.
Know what you are?
You make me sick.
If we thought like you --
You know what I want?
I want ideas.
I want one idea.
One idea could get us out of here!
We' il just have to be sure it' s the right idea.
We' il find it.
We' il know it when we see it.
I' il know it when I see it!
Clear and straightforward and plain as the nose on your face.
-- believed he was going to a place where he' d be happy.
And in so believing, he created a veritable paradise for himself right here.
Unfortunately, not all of us can have the positive conviction of LOO.
But, thankfully, not all of us are burdened with the ominous forebodings of SEN.
I, myself --
Now, that' s what I mean by the wrong idea.
Look, I' m not going to try to prove the usefulness of history.
It is genuinely too obvious to need proof.
I want to help you.
You can help me.
Here.
Take a biscuit.
You understand, we' re all in this together.
You want to leave.
You' re not like them.
I' il see to it that we all get out of here.
Take it easy!
Look at them.
It' s pathetic.
It' s pitiful.
They' ve even begun to go into my corner and look for things.
My things.
You' re with me.
I know.
I have a contract.
All it says is:
"You' re with me."
We' re all in this together.
We must convince the others.
Later, then.
We need a new unity.
And not a unity which discourages dissent.
We need dissent, but we need a creative dissent.
Our voices are not raised in any harmonious chorus...... but our differences are differences of emphasis rather than of fundamentals.
- Tomorrow, as we -- - Nondescript 6431 399.

They live in the outer shell.
Quite unique.
There have been two here before, and they smell.
What do you know?
Come here, my friend.
Let me touch you.
What' d he just do?
What' s wrong, huh?
Your lunch is dirty.
What a waste.
Here, we can save some of it.
It' s all right.
Everything' s fine.
What?
Well, if you didn' t want it, why' d you take it?
I thought this was all settled.
- Where you going?
- I' m leaving.
Leaving?
Leaving what?
You can' t leave.
Hey, wait.
Oh, I know, the smell.
Yeah, it' s terrible.
It' s a little bit....
Hey, you can' t -- You can' t leave without....
Just a minute.
Wait.
Just wait there a minute.
After long deliberation, I have decided to go out...... and personally examine the barrier...... to learn firsthand what difficulties are involved...... and decide how to overcome them.
I recognize an element of risk...... but moments such as these require that a choice be made and action taken...... regardless of the danger.
We' il be back soon...... but we' il be gone long enough to form an accurate and functional escape.
And I shall have an honest idea how best to organize us into a working unit.
- The new alignment.
- lncredible.
Wait.
Wait.
Hey, wait for me.
Just the thing to put them on their feet.
Show them who the leaders are.
When we get back, they' il be right there, right in the palm of my hand.
There' s no question.
Even old PTO would be with us...... if he' d still been advised.
How far before they can' t see us anymore, huh?
Maybe we better sit down right here.
Hey, rest for a while.
I can' t....
I can' t see them anymore.
LUH.
You' re going after LUH, aren' t you?
Why, it' s ridiculous.
Going after....
Oh, wait, I knew there was something I had to tell you.
LUH, you know, the other --?
The new LUH?
He told me he' d seen her.
He saw her just before he came out here.
- She' s gonna be coming out here.
- How was she?
Oh, very well.
Very good health.
Just exactly the way --
- You' re lying.
- No, I am not.
The air' s getting thinner.
Or pressure' s getting greater.
It' s the pressure.
How do you feel?
Shouldn' t be this far.
There' s no air.
I haven' t got the time.
You can stay here if you like.
I' il come with you.
What?
Look.
What?
That' s a man.
It' s a man.
He' s waving.
He' s waving to us.
Hi.
Hi.
Hello.
Where' d you guys come from?
Oh, well, it doesn' t make any difference.
Is that food?
I' m starving.
Do you mind?
How did you get here?
I mean, I was lost.
You' re not lost now?
Know the way out?
- That' s the way out.
- That' s the way we came.
Yeah, but maybe you were traveling in circles.
That' s the way out.
How do you know?
Well, look.
Look more closely.
You see?
Come on.
Oh, yeah.
Nothing stopped us.
Come on.
Here' s a doorway.

You know, the fantasy bureau...... electrically- generated realities and all that.

Would you like part of this?
It' s not very much.

Halt.

Expenditures are 1 000 and rising.
Things don 't seem to make sense.
Sometimes I see things get left out...... and they don 't fit.
People don' t seem to see them.
Or they don' t know what to do.
Sometimes l --
Sometimes little....
A little adjustment...... can make all the difference.
I wanna do the right thing.
I wanna go back.
I....
I can -- I can start again.
I can change.
I can -- I can help.
I just need a....
Need to rest up for a little while.
This is no place for prayer.
If you want to speak to OMM, you must go to a unichapel, you know that.

I' m gonna see this gets into your report.
No, I' m leaving now.
I' m sorry, I have to report all intruders.

You' re in violation.
I' il have to report you to the authorities.
- No, it' s not my time.
- Please, just --
Trapped.
Trapped.
Looks like the only way out is the way we came in.
Say, do you have any more of that food?
I' m hungry.
She' s not there.
Who are you looking for?
Can you hear me?
Stay calm.
Everything will be all right.
The door seems to be jammed.
Please check the lock on your side.
Everything will be all right.
We are here to help you.
Stay calm.
We are not going to harm you.
Everything will be all right.
Well, unless that computer has made a mistake...... that 's your roommate.
No.
No, you 're wrong.
I hope that auxiliary load holds.
I' m almost through to the upper positive plates.
Upper positive plates?
Maybe you are right.
Maybe there' s something wrong with the computer.
I don' t know.
It' s a strange life.
Cybernetics, genetics, lasers and all those things.
I guess I' il never understand any of that stuff.
Guess maybe holograms are not supposed to.
