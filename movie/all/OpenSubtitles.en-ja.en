Since time began... a war has been waged in the shadows... between the armies of Good and Evil.
It may be fought on a grand scale... or within the heart of a single individual... or even a child.
The Evil has taken many forms... and used the darkest of arts.
In our time, they call themselves simply... the Hand.
The Good follow the way ofkimagure.
Its masters can see the future... and perhaps even bring back the dead.
Legend tells of a unique warrior... a lost soul.
This warrior is a woman... a motherless daughter.
And it is her destiny to tip the balance between Good and Evil.
She is a treasure, and both sides seek her out... as a final weapon in an ancient war.
- [Man # 2]
It doesn' t matter.
You can' t stop her.
- Her?
I was afraid if I told you, you wouldn' t take the job.
I never should' ve hired you.
Who do you think' s coming for you?
You may have heard of her.
Her name... is Elektra.
- She' s an urban legend, sir.
That woman died years ago.
Well, then somebody must have brought her back from the dead.
You know, Bauer, when you' ve done the things I' ve done... you make a lot of enemies.
My private security detail... the best money could buy.
I barely got away.
Then she came for me.
I was under the protection of the Hand itself, who sent their best.
Although they seemed more interested in killing Elektra than in protecting me.
Took maybe 10, 15 minutes max.
Didn' t really think why I kept gettin 'away.
So here I am.
And now I understand her.
She wanted me to feel this... what it' s like to have nowhere to go... nowhere to turn.
How' s your perimeter doing now?
Delta, what' s your status?
Son of a bitch.
The closer they can get to you before you know they' re there.
- Ah, Christ.
They say Elektra whispers in your ear before she kills you.
Report.!
- Jesus Christ!
You can' t fight a ghost, Bauer.
- [Exhales]
So, what happens now?
Just cold?
Death' s not that bad.
How do you know?
I died once.
So am I to understand that with all the power of the Hand... that the Treasure continues to elude us?
Perhaps if we had pursued it sooner... and more aggressively...
You dare to blame Master Roshi?
Seems our methods are too mild for Kirigi.
Not at all, sensei.
But if we cannot have the weapon ourselves... allow me to make sure it does not fall into the hands of those who may use it against us.
Master, allow me.
Things like this must be handled smoothly, quietly.
Then work smoothly, Meizumi, but quickly.
Kirigi?
Yes, Father.
Patience.
Geez, Elektra, you' re gonna end up with a bullet in your head.
I brought you a little something.
I already cleaned there.
- Get rid of my D. N. A.
Right.
I know you like to look.
- Less my 10%.
- And half to the bank on the Isle of Man.
I could put you in touch...
Look, I don' t want to tell you how to do your thing... but quite a body count on this one, E.
We were only getting paid for DeMarco.
Was it necessary?
Had to be done.
Did it?
Elektra.
Did it?
Besides, they were gonna kill me.
Absolutely.
I am obligated to tell you we just got an absolutely fantastic new offer...
I need a breather.
- I' m tired.
'cause you are gonna crash, baby, you know that.
It' s a lot of money, this new offer.
You know what?
And just tell me.
Two.
Ah, they' il give it to somebody else.
They wouldn' t pay that to somebody else.
You got that right.
They asked specifically for you.
I' il call you when I get the target.
Get some sleep.
You might wanna reflect a bit.
Do you know the way, Elektra?
Kimagure, the ability to control time... the future... even life and death.
I know I' m the best student here.
The most powerful.
You understand violence and pain.
But you do not know the way.
- That' s my point.
I can' t teach you.
I want you to go.
Is this a test, sensei?
No, not a test.
Just go.
I don' t have anywhere to go.
- [Elektra]
- I just want to get this over with.
Listen, why don' t you tell me about the view?
You know, you got the...
Keep pedaling.
Five more minutes.
Only use your feet.
Let' s push, push, push, push!
She' s just a kid.
Keep going, Elektra.
You could have killed me!
What are you doing here?
I' m friends with the Wheelwrights.
You cut my friggin' jacket.
- The front door was unlocked.
- Yeah, it was.
Ask anybody.
It' s broken.
- What' d you steal?
What do you think I am?
Please don' t call the cops.
My dad will kill me.
In some parts of the world, they just cut your hands off.
How did you do that?
Get out of here.
Are you looking for me?
Hi.
Are you the new, uh, tenant?
Eddie Ferris, the Realtor... he said, uh, a young woman had taken it for the month.
What do you want?
This is kind of awkward, but, uh... have you seen a girl... 13- year- old, uh, blondish hair to about here?
My daughter, Abby.
- I saw her late afternoon.
- She broke into my house.
Really?
She, uh, didn' t take anything, did she?
- Good.
I' m Mark Miller.
We' re in the little cabin two houses down.
Okay, thanks.
But please leavejust your name.
We don' t get a name soon, I' m walking.
Hey.
How long have you been standing there?
Like, a minute.
What did you tell my dad?
Did you tell him I broke into your house?
- Well, you didn' t have to tell him.
I thought you were cool.
- Yeah, no kidding.
He made me come ask you to have Christmas dinner with us.
- Christmas?
December 25?
Did you know today' s Christmas?
I have something to do.
Everything' s closed.
You' re on an island.
Please?
It' s just the two of us every night... and I' m bored out of my skull.
What are you doing?
Why?
- No.
Please?
Hmm?
I have to change my clothes.
Great!
I' m Abby.
Elektra.
Cool.
I told you not to leave the house.
- Abby.
We have a guest.
She told me that you' d invited me.
Uh- uh.
Please, stay.
I' m glad you' re here.
Wine?
Water.
Her name' s Elektra, Dad.
- Elektra.
Your parents must have had a sense of humor.
Not really.
So when she sees all the cute guys who like me... just as friends, Dad... she accidentally spills poster paint all over my model of the Taj Mahal.
So I put glue on her shoes.
But that was way back in the day in... in, um...
Baltimore.
So, I was a little surprised to see you take the Wheelwright place.
Not many renters this time of year.
It' s just for the month, for work.
What do you do anyway?
- Hmm.
- Abby.
Do you know what those are?
They' re from Indonesia.
Centuries ago, you had to be the best fighter in your village to earn them.
I bought 'em off eBay.
Is there a school here on the island?
Uh, we' re trying homeschooling for a while.
And I' m doing algebra one on my own.
She' s a good student.
It' s the, uh, behavioral stuff that' s been a problem.
I have authority issues, and I don' t take bullshit well.
It' s okay.
Suddenly I got a teenager on my hands.
- You can tell, huh?
- No, I shouldn' t.
Merry Christmas?
Where' s her mother?
She died... a couple of years ago.
Back in Baltimore?
Drunk driver.
My mother died when I was young.
I should go.
- Come on, it' s early.
Thanks for dinner.
You just got a delivery.
Yeah, that' s why the big bucks.
- Nothing.
Then there' il be no problems.
I' il call you when it' s done.
How' s math going?
How do you think it' s going?
Not now or not ever?
- Background?
E, they' il just send somebody else.
- I' il get sandbags from the shed.
They make it sound all exciting, but you know it' s just rain.
Now!
Mark.!
Can I talk to you?
Can we talk inside?
Yeah, sure.
Hey, what' s up?
I need to talk to your dad.
Now!
Go, Abby.
- What?
They won' tjust kill you.
They' il kill Abby.
- Okay.
Get back!
Go!
What' s coming ne x t will be worse.
I believe Kirigi wishes to address the Council of the Hand.
Venerable master... despite your delicacy and subtlety... you have failed to solve the problem of the Treasure.
- And my men are taking care of it.
Your men are dead!
Killed by the female, Elektra, the gaijin.
Your forces are an abomination!
Master Roshi... the Hand cannot afford to lose the Treasure for another generation.
So I humbly request you allow me this task.
Perhaps with a little less delicacy... my forces will not be defeated by a mere woman.
The task is yours.
Complete it, and you will have proven yourself worthy ofleading this council.
I will step aside.
The Hand.
So who' s gonna help you out on this one, E?
- Just give me his location.
I got it handled.
You' re up, blind man.
Triple carom on the four- three- two- one- six with a bank mass√©.
Just the first one.
That is the first one.
Aw, you gotta be kidding me.
Eight ball in the corner.
- Leave your money on the table.
Go play some pinball.
- Just go.
Same walk.
Same perfume.
They need your help.
Over here.
This is Mark Miller.
Mark and his daughter, Abby, are being chased by the Hand... and they need your protection.
The Hand is your business, not mine.
What did you imagine would happen next?
I didn' t really have time to think about it.
Blind instinct.
Then you and I are back where we started, Elektra.
Did you ever ask why the Hand was after them?
Mr. Miller doesn' t know?
I do know.
He tried to run.
And what?
They killed my wife, Abby' s mom.
I lied.
You' re on your own.
Why did you really save them, Elektra?
A down payment on your sins?
Has she told you what she actually does for a living, Mr. Miller?
That' s enough for me.
Then you landed on the lucky side of the street.
- Because with most people...
Well, Elektra... you haven' t changed.
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?
South America.
- No.
Isn' t that part of your code or something?
I don' t have a code, Abby.
- We' il be okay, Abby.
No, we won' t.
We won' t.!
Just like Mom.
Get in the car.
Get in the car!
What' s wrong?
Three blocks over in the parking lot.
We need to kill the gaijin assassin first.
Should we go now?
Keep track of them.
I' m a soccer mom.
So, you, um... you really kill people for a living?
Yeah.
Why?
It' s what I' m good at.
That' s messed up.
Yeah.
Well, well, the reluctant assassin.
Sorry to drag you into this, McCabe.
I' m Abby.
I' m wondering what you' re doing here.
Go ahead and help yourselves to whatever you need.
- You' re welcome.
You want to pull the trigger, or should I do it?
I said you' d crash, and you are crashing.
I just want to get 'em someplace safe, give' em a chance.
They got no chance.
Don' t go down with them.
- I' il need plane tickets.
Throw in some season tickets to the Lakers.
Go.
Why can' t we tell her?
- She saved us.
If she knew...
- Your friend?
She' s the only one I have.
- You' re not gonna die!
Don' t you ever say that again... ever.
- Yes.
Elektra?
They told me to change my appearance, so...
You look great.
Thanks.
Can you show me how to use those things, the, uh, salad tongs?
- Sais.
They' re not for you.
I want to learn how to defend myself.
They' re for killing.
You use them.
I don' t want you to be like me.
I do.
Do you wanna learn something really, really difficult?
What?
Come on.
Now sit down.
- What is this, yoga?
- Kimagure.
It' s more valuable than learning to use a weapon... because it allows you to see what' s gonna happen before it happens.
- Concentrate.
It' s not easy.
How long did it take you to master?
I never actually finished my training.
I only know enough to keep myself alive.
But there are true masters like Stick who can use kimagure to bring back the dead.
- Close your eyes and breathe.
Just sit quietly.
How are you doing?
Thank you.
Oh, don' t thank me, Mark.
Please, you don' t really know what I was doing.
Sure I do.
You were there to kill us.
I knew it as soon as you took the Wheelwright place.
I' m not a good person to get involved with.
I' m not asking for anything.
I' m sorry.
Yeah, I hated that.
Get back now.!
- What happened?
That bird' s been hanging around here since late yesterday.
They' re here.
- Let' s use the truck.
- But that' s the best way.
There isn' t time.
Take you out past the orchard to the trees.
What about you?
- Shit.
Let' s go.
- Keep 'em safe.
I' il tell you what.
You might as well kill me now, 'cause I ain' t talking.
Talking is not necessary.
- But I accept the first half of your proposal.
Typhoid, Stone, Tattoo.
Hurry.
Hold up.
Just keep running.
Go.
Why didn' t you tell me?
Ah, you are the little treasure, aren' t you?
The war is over.
The war has just begun.
Move back, Abby.
She is safe.
Another day, old man.
Rest now.
Know where he is.
I' m blind, and I see more than any of you, because I don' t look.
This whole war with the Hand, everything, it' s all about her, isn' t it?
They call her the Treasure.
Word got around fast.
They tried to steal her.
- And you set this up... the contract, McCabe, all of this... you hired me to kill them.
You' re entitled to your opinion.
You manipulated me.
Was all this a test?
Everything from the day you threw me out, has it all been a test?
What if I had failed?
Some lessons can' t be taught, Elektra.
They must be lived to be understood.
When you came here, you were filled with anger.
All the decency you once had, poisoned by violence and tragedy.
This is not the way.
This is not our way.
You talk in riddles, old man.
It keeps my students alert.
I always knew your heart was pure.
You simply needed to see it for yourself.
What about Abby?
She has no choice.
Still breaking and entering I see.
Sorry.
Keep practicing.
I' m sorry I lied to you.
You did what you needed to do.
I didn' t wanna lie to you.
Neither did my dad.
It made me sick not telling you.
Nobody tells the truth about themselves.
Including you.
Especially me.
- Like that.
And the, uh, the counting.
- Sorry?
- O. C. D.
I don' t have O. C. D.
I had it when I was a kid, but I haven' t done that in years.
When you walk slow like that.
Are you counting?
Don' t mock me.
I' m still your superior.
Maybe.
Wanna find out?
I' m gonna go find my dad.
You' re forcing it.
You' il be better than I am very soon.
I don' t wanna stay here.
What do you want?
Winner take all.
And when I kill you, the little one is ours.
And when you don' t, she is free forever.
- Agreed.
We will meet where it all began.
For you, at least.
Clever girl.
We meet again.
Now you' il remember.
There' s nothing you can do.
So the balance tips to me.
Let her go.!
You taught her well.
But it' s time for a new master.
Is that what the blind man' s been teaching you?
But you' il learn to anticipate your opponent.
- Just like you.
Tattoo, the Treasure' s here.
Stay right behind me.
Stay close, Abby.
Elektra!
I' ve seen it before.
Abby, where are you?
- Not exactly.
So let' s keep your death between you and me.
It ends now.
I told you, there' s nothing you can do.
You' re slipping, Elektra.
Keep going.
I' m just a kid.
I don' t wanna stay here.
Elektra.
I' il take good care ofher.
Abby.
Abby.
Listen to me.
I always knew your heart was pure.
You simply needed to see it for yourself.
Hey, warrior girl.
Come here.
Come here, Abby.
I just found you.
Thank you.
Take good care of her.
Sorry.
Yeah, I hated that.
No one' s after you.
Back to school?
[Laughs]
You gave me my life back.
You gave me mine.
Will I see you again?
We' il find each other.
Please don' t let her be like me.
Why not?
You didn' t turn out so bad.
That' s up to her.
Anyway, your second life' s never really like your first, is it?
Sometimes... it' s even better.
[Music playing]
NARRATOR:
On the clearest of nights when the winds of the Etherium were calm and peaceful
the great merchant ships with their cargoes of Arcturian sura crystals felt safe and secure
Little did they suspect that they were pursued by pirates
And the most feared of all these pirates was the notorious Captain Nathaniel Flint
Fire!
[All gasping]
Like a Candarian zap- wing ovetaking its prey --
[Door creaks]
WOMAN:
James Pleiades Hawkins
I thought you were asleep an hour ago.
Mom, I was just getting to the best part.
Please?
Oh, can those eyes get any bigger?
Scootch over.
NARRATOR: like a Candarian zap- wing ovetaking its prey
Flint and his band of renegades swooped in out of nowhere
Ha ha ha ha!
And then. gathering up their spoils vanished without a trace
NARRATOR:
Flint' s secret trove was never found but stories have persisted that it remains hidden somewhere at the fathest reaches of the galaxy stowed with riches beyond imagination -- the loot of a thousand worlds
Treasure Planet
Blow your nose.
How do you think Captain Flint did it, Mom?
How' d he swoop in out of nowhere and vanished without a trace?
I have no idea.
Come here, you, you li --
[Pffft]
OK, now it' s time for this little spacer to go to sleep.
You think somebody' il ever find Treasure Planet?
Sweetheart, I think it' s more...
I know it' s real.
It' s real.
- Nighty- night, Mom.
- Nighty- night, sweetheart.
I love you.
NARRATOR:
There are nights when the winds of the Etherium so inviting in their promise of flight and freedom made one' s spirit soar!
Yaaaa- hoo!
Whoo!
Ha ha ha!
[Sirens blaring]
[Thunder]
I know -- refill on the purp juice.
There we go.
That' s four powdered spheroids... two lunar eclipses, and it' s a big bowl... of Zorellian jelly worms for the big boy!
- Awesome!
- Enjoy.
It' s been a madhouse here all morning.
Ah!
Mmm!
[Sniffing]
Hello.
DOPPLER:
What brings you here curious littleone?
Are your parents around?
What' s the matter?
Cat got your -- yaah!
Oh, they' re so adorable at that age.
Oh, yes... deplorable.
Hmm.
Much better.
I know he had some rough spots... earlier this year, but I really think... that he' s starting to turn a corner.
Mrs. Hawkins?
Jim!
OK.
Thanks for the lift, guys.
Not so fast.
We apprehended your son operating... a solar vehicle in a restricted area.
Moving violation 9- 0- 4... section fifteen, paragraph, um...
Six?
- Jim!
- As you are aware, ma' am... this constitutes a violation of his probation.
No, I understand.
Um, but could we just --
Um. ahem. pardon me
Officers, if I might, uh, interject here.
Perhaps you' ve heard of me.
Uh, I have a clipping.
- Are you the boy' s father?
Eww!
He' s just an old friend of the family.
Back off, sir!
I will take it from here.
Ahem.
Don' t ever let me do that again.
Due to repeated violations of statute 1 5- C... we have impounded his vehicle.
Any more slip- ups will result... in a one- way ticket to Juvenile Hall.
- The slammo.
It won' t happen again.
We see his type all the time, ma' am.
- Dead- enders.
Losers
- Let' s motor.
Jim, I have had it.
Do you want to go to Juvenile Hall? ls that it?
Jim?
Jim, look at me.
It' s been hard enough keeping this place... afloat by myself without you going --
There was nobody around.
Those cops just won' t get off my --
Forget it.
Mrs Hawkins!
Yes, I' il be right there, Mrs. Dunwiddie.
Jim, I just don' t want to see you... throw away your entire future.
Yeah, what future?
DR DOPPLER:
Sarah
Trying to run a business while raising a felon like -- felon... fellow... fellow like Jim.
I' m at the end of my rope.
Ever since his father left well.
And you know how smart he is
He built his first solar surfer when he was eight!
And yet. he' s failing at school he is constantly in trouble and when I talk to him. he' s like a stranger to me
Delbet I' ve tried everything --
[Engines sputtering]
Hey, Mister?
Mister, you' re OK in there, right?
He' s a- comin '.
Can you hear him?
Those gears and gyros clickin 'and whirrin'...
like the devil himself!
Uh, hit your head there pretty hard, didn' t ya?
He' s after me chest... that fiendish cyborg and his band of cutthroats.
[Straining]
But they' il have to pry it... from old Billy Bones' cold, dead fingers afore I -- argh!
[Coughing]
Uh, come on, give me your arm.
That' s it.
- Mom' s gonna love this.
[Click]
Thanks for listening, Delbert.
[Sighs]
You' il see.
I keep dreaming one day I' il open that door... and there he' il be just the way he was.
A smiling, happy little boy, holding a new pet... and begging me to let him keep it.
[Gasps]
James Pleiades Hawkins!
Mom, he' s hurt... bad!
[Gasping]
He' il be comin 'soon
Can' t let them find this.
The cyborg!
[Gasps]
[Sarah gasps]
We gotta go!
I believe I' m with Jim on this one!
[Pirates shouting]
Delilah!
[Yelping excitedly]
PiRATE:
Find it!
Sarah
I' m an expert in the laws of physical science.
- Three!
- Aah!
Go!
That' s it!
Hyah!
DOPPLER:
I just spoke with the constabulary
Those blaggard pirates have fled without a trace
I' m sorry, Sarah.
I' m afraid the old Benbow lnn has burned to the ground.
Well, certainly a lot of trouble... over that odd little sphere.
Those markings baffle me
Unlike anything I' ve ever encountered
DOPPLER:
[Gasps]
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait!
[Gasps]
Whoo!
The Coral Galaxy!
DOPPLER:
That' s the Cygnus Cross and that' s the Kerian Abyss.
What' s this?
Why, it -- it' s...
Treasure Planet.
No!
That' s Treasure Planet!
Flint' s trove?
The loot of a thousand worlds?
You know what this means?
It means that all that treasure is only a boat ride away.
Whoever brings it back would hold an eternal place... atop the pantheon of explorers!
[Click]
What just happened?
Mom, this is it.
This is the answer to all our problems.
Jim, there is absolutely no way --
Don' t you remember, all those stories?
That' s all they were -- stories!
With that treasure... we could rebuild the Benbow a hundred times over!
Well, this is -- it' s just -- oh, my.
Delbert, would you please explain how ridiculous this is?
It' s totally preposterous... traversing the entire galaxy alone.
Now at last, we hear some sense!
- That' s why I' m going with you.
- Delbert!
I' il use my savings to finance the expedition.
I' il commission a ship, hire a captain and a crew.
You' re not serious.
All my life I' ve been waiting for an opportunity like this... and here it is screaming, "Go, Delbert!
OK.
You' re both grounded!
JlM:
Mom. look
I know that I keep messing everything up... and I know... that I let you down.
But this is my chance to make it up to you.
I' m gonna set things right.
Sarah?
lf I may?
You said yourself, you' ve tried everything.
There are much worse remedies... than a few character- building months in space.
Are you saying this because it' s the right thing... or because you really want to go?
I really, really, really, really want to go... and it' s the right thing.
[Sighs]
I don' t want to lose you.
Mom... you won' t.
I' il make you proud.
Well. uh. ahem
There we are then.
We' il begin preparations at once.
Jim, my boy, soon we' il be off to the spaceport.
Jim!
Wait for me!
[Breathing deeply]
Well, Jim, this should be a wonderful opportunity... for the two of us to get to know one another.
You know what they say, familiarity breeds, um... well, contempt, but, in our case --
OK?
- Second berth on your right!
- You can' t miss it.
It' s the suit, isn' t it?
I should never have listened... to that pushy two- headed saleswoman.
This one said it fit, that one said it was my color.
I get so flustered.
Ooh!
This is our ship!
OFFhCER:
Stow those casks foward!
Heave together now!
Sorry about that.
[Angry farting noises]
I' m fluent in Flatula, Jim.
Took two years of it in high school.
Cool.
Everything shipshape?
Shipshape it is, sir, but I' m not the captain.
[Meow]
Mr. Arrow, I' ve checked this miserable ship... from stem to stern, and, as usual, it' s... spot on.
Can you get nothing wrong?
You flatter me, Captain.
Ah, Dr. Doppler, I presume?
- Hello!
Stop that banging!
lf I may, Doctor, this works so much better... when it' s right- way up and plugged in.
There you go.
lf you don' t mind, I can manage my own plugging!
I' m Captain Amelia...
late of a few run- ins with the Protean armada.
Nasty business, but I won' t bore you with my scars.
You' ve met my first officer, Mr. Arrow.
Sterling, tough, dependable, honest, brave, and true.
Please, Captain.
Oh, shut up, Arrow.
Ahem, excuse me.
I hate to interrupt this lovely banter... but may I introduce to you, Jim Hawkins?
Jim, you see, is the boy who found the treasure --
[Growls]
I' d like a word with you in my stateroom.
Doctor, to muse and blabber about a treasure map... in front of this particular crew... demonstrates a level of ineptitude... that borders on the imbecilic... and I mean that in a very caring way.
lmbecilic, did you say?
Foolishness, I' ve --
May I see the map, please?
Here.
Fascinating.
Mr. Hawkins, in the future... you will address me as "Captain" or "Ma' am."
ls that clear?
Ugh...
Mr. Hawkins?
- That' il do.
Gentlemen, this must be kept under lock and key... when not in use.
And, Doctor, again... with the greatest possible respect... zip your howling screamer.
Captain, I assure you l --
Let me make this as monosyilabic as possible.
I don' t much care for this crew you hired.
They' re... how did I describe them, Arrow?
I said something rather good this morning before coffee.
"A ludicrous parcel of driveling galoots," ma' am.
- Now, see here --
Doctor, I' d love to chat -- tea, cake, the whole shebang -- but I have a ship to launch... and you' ve got your outfit to buff up.
Mr. Arrow, please escort these two neophytes... down to the galley straightaway.
Young Hawkins will be working for our cook, Mr. Silver.
The cook?
That... feline!
Who does she think is working for whom?
It' s my map, and she' s got me bussin 'tables?
I' il not tolerate a cross word about our captain!
[Whistling]
Mr Silver?
Why, Mr. Arrow, sir.
Bringin 'in such fine and distinguished gents to grace my humble galley.
Had I known, I' d have tucked in me shirt.
A cyborg!
May I introduce Dr. Doppler?
The financier of our voyage.
Well, thank you.
Um, love the eye.
Uh, this young lad is Jim Hawkins.
Uh...
Aw, now, don' t be too put off by this hunk of hardware.
Whoa!
[Humming]
Here, now, have a taste of me famous bonzabeast stew.
Delightfully tangy, yet robust.
Aah!
ln fact, that was part of the old family!
Oh, ho!
I' m just kiddin ', Doc!
Uh, yeah, well...
Go on, Jimbo.
SlLVER:
Morph!
You jiggle- headed blob of mischief!
Wha --?
What is that thing?
"What is that thing?"
He' s a morph
I rescued the little shape- shifter on Proteus 1
Aw, he took a shine to me.
We been together ever since.
Yeah.
We' re about to get underway.
Would you like to observe the launch, doctor?
Would l?
Does an active galactic nucleus have superluminal jets?
I' il follow you.
Mr. Hawkins will stay here in your charge, Mr. Silver.
Beggin 'your pardon, sir, but --
See to it the new cabin boy' s kept busy.
- Aw, but, no, but -- - No, you can' t --
[Both sigh]
So, Captain' s put you with me, eh?
Whatever.
Well, who be a humble cyborg to argue with a captain?
You know... these purps... they' re kind of like the ones back home on Montressor.
You ever been there?
I can' t say as I have, Jimbo.
Come to think of it, just before I left...
I met this old guy, who was, um... he was kind of looking for a cyborg buddy of his.
ls that so?
Yeah.
What was that old salamander' s name?
Bones.
Billy Bones?
Bones?!
T' ain' t ringin 'any bells.
Must have been a different cyborg.
ARROW:
Prepare to cast off!
Eh, off with you, lad, and watch the launch.
There' il be plenty work a- waitin 'for you afterwards.
We best be keepin 'a sharp eye on this one, eh, Morph?
We wouldn' t want him strayin 'into things he shouldn' t.
We' re all clear, Captain!
Are we ready to raise this creaking tub?
My pleasure, Captain.
All hands to stations!
Smatly now!
Loose all solar sails!
Heave up the braces
Brace up
Ooh.
Mr. Zoff, engage artificial gravity.
South by southwest, Mr. Turnbuckle, heading 2- 1- 0- 0.
Aye, Captain.
Full speed, Mr. Arrow, if you please.
Take her away!
Brace yourself, Doctor.
Oof!
[Woooo]
Upon my word, an Orcus Galacticus.
Uh, Doctor, I' d stand clear --
SlLVER:
Ah. 'tis a grand day for sailing.
Captain and look at you
You' re as trim and as bonny as a sloop with new sails and a fresh coat of paint
You can keep that kind of flim- flammery... for your spaceport floozies, Silver.
Spaceport floozy, spaceport floozy --
You cut me to the quick, Captain.
I speaks nothing but me heart at all times.
Nothing but me heat
And, by the way, isn' t that your cabin boy... aimlessly footling about in those shrouds?
Yep, it -- oh...
Jimbo!
I got two new friends I' d like you to meet.
Say hello to Mr. Mop and Mrs. Bucket.
Heh heh heh heh!
Yeah, I got your Mr. Mop.
[Murmuring]
What are you looking at, weirdo?
[Hisssss]
Cabin boys should learn to mind their own business.
You got something to hide, bright eyes?
Maybe your ears don' t work so well.
Ahem.
Why, you impudent little --
Slice him!
[Poot poot phoot]
Any last words, cabin boy?
Mr. Scroop...
you ever see what happens to a fresh purp... when you squeeze real hard?
ARROW:
What' s all this. then?
You know the rules.
There' il be no brawling on this ship.
Aye, aye, sir.
Any further offenders will be confined to the brig... for the remainder of the voyage.
Am I clear, Mr. Scroop?
Transparently.
SlLVER:
Well done, Mr. Arrow, sir!
A tight ship' s a happy ship, sir.
Jimbo, I gave you a job.
Hey, I was doing it until that bug thing --
Belay that!
Morph?
Keep an eye on this pup... and let me know if there be any more distractions.
[Sighs]
[Crew grumbling]
So, we' re all here, then.
- Fine.
Now, if you pardon my plain speaking, gentlemen... are you all... stark- raving, totally blinking daft?!
After all me finagling getting us hired... as an upstanding crew... you want to blow the whole mutiny before it' s time?
The boy was sniffing about.
You just stick to the plan, you bug- brained twit.
As for the boy, I' il run him so ragged... he won' t have time to think.
[Coughs]
Well, this has been a fun day, huh?
Making new friends like that spider psycho.
Spider psycho, spider psycho.
A little uglier.
Mwah- ha- ha- ha!
Pretty close.
SlLVER:
Well thank heavens for little miracles.
Up here for an hour... and the deck' s still in one piece.
Um, look, I, uh...
What you did...
Thanks.
Didn' t your pap ever teach you... to pick your fights a bit more carefully?
No.
Oh.
Sorry, lad.
I' m doing just fine.
ls that so?
Well, since the captain has put you in my charge...
like it or not, I' il be pounding a few skills... into that thick head of yours to keep you out of trouble.
- What?
- From now on...
I' m not letting you out of me sight.
You can' t do --
You won' t so much as eat, sleep... or scratch your bum without my say- so.
Don' t do me any favors!
Oh, you can be sure of that, my lad.
You can be sure of that.
Heh heh heh heh!
Put some elbow into it.
I am a question to the world
Not an answer to be heard
Or a moment that' s held in your arms
And what do you think you' d ever say
You don' t know me
And I' il never be what you want
Made of pain
And what do you think you' d understand?
I' m a man
You can take me and throw me away
And how can you learn what' s never shown
Yeah. you stand here on your own
'Cause I' m not here
And I want a moment to be real
Want to touch things I don' t feel
Want to hold on and feel I belong
And how can the world want me to change
They' re the ones that stay the same
They don' t know me
But I' m still here
And you see the things they never see
I could be
Now you know me
And I' m not afraid
And I want to tell you who I am
Can you help me be a man?
They can' t break me
As long as I know who I am
They can' t tell me who to be
'Cause I' m not what they see
Yeah. the world is still sleeping
While I keep on dreaming for me
And the words are just whispers and lies
That I' il never believe
And I want a moment to be real
Want to touch things I don' t feel
Whoa!
How can you say I never change?
They' re the ones that stay the same
'Cause I' m still here
I' m the one son still here
I' m still here
[Song fades]
[Pulley squeaking]
Oh, ho ho!
You having a little trouble there?
Oh, get away from me.
[Laughing]
lf I could maneuver a skiff like that when I was your age... they' d be bowing in the streets when I walked by today.
- Oof.
I don' t know.
- Whew.
But I' m gonna change all that.
How so?
Uh, I got some plans.
Gonna make people see me a little different.
Sometimes, plans go astray.
Hmm.
Oh, thank you, Morphy.
So, uh, how' d that happen anyway?
You give up a few things chasing a dream.
Heh.
I' m hoping it is, Jimbo.
[Screams]
What the devil?
Good heavens.
The star Pelusa... it' s gone supernova!
Evasive action, Mr. Turnbuckle!
Aye- aye, Captain.
[Shouting]
Secure all sails!
Reef them down. men!
Yeah, baby!
Ha ha ha ha!
- Silver!
[Yelling]
Captain, the star!
It' s devolving into a...
[Gasps] a black hole!
Ohh!
No, you don' t, you --
Blast these waves!
No, Captain.
They' re not erratic at all.
There' il be one more in precisely 47. 2 seconds.
Followed by the biggest magilla of them all!
Brilliant, Doctor!
We' il ride that last magilla out of here.
All sails secured, Captain!
Now release them immediately!
You heard her, men.
Unfurl those sails
- But we just finished...
- Tying them down!
- Make up your blooming minds!
Mr. Hawkins... make sure all lifelines are secured good and tight!
Aye- aye, Captain.
Very good!
Oof!
Captain. the last wave!
Here it comes!
Hold on to your lifelines, gents!
Oof!
Captain!
That -- oh, my goodness.
That was -- that was absolutely -- that was the most --
Actually, Doctor... your astronomical advice was most helpful.
Well, uh, uh -- thank you.
Thank you very much.
Well, I have a lot of help to offer anatomically -- amanamonically -- as- astronomically.
[Slap]
Well, I must congratulate you, Mr. Silver.
It seems your cabin boy... did a bang- up job with those lifelines.
All hands accounted for, Mr. Arrow?
Mr. Arrow?
I' m afraid Mr. Arrow has been lost.
His lifeline was not secured.
No, I checked them all.
l -- I did.
They were secure.
Ahem.
Fine spacer... finer than most of us could ever hope to be... but he knew the risks, as do we all.
We carry on.
It weren' t your fault, you know?
Why, half the crew would be spinning in that black abyss --
I screwed up!
For two seconds, I thought that maybe...
I could do something right, but --
[Sighs]
Forget it.
Now, you listen to me, James Hawkins.
You got the makings of greatness in ya... but you gotta take the helm and chart your own course.
[Sniffles]
Lad, it' s all right, Jimbo.
Now, Jim, I, um...
I best be getting about my watch... and you best be getting some shut- eye.
Getting in too deep here, Morphy.
Next thing ya know, they' il be saying I' ve gone soft.
[Crew snoring]
Uh -- oh!
Ugh!
[Sighs]
Morph?
Ow!
Pbbbt!
- Come back here!
[Sighs]
You little squid.
Squid.
Busted!
Look. what we' re saying is we' re sick of all this waiting
There' s only three of them left
We are wanting to move.
We don' t move till we got the treasure in hand.
I say we kill 'em all now
I say what' s to say!
Disobey my orders again...
like that stunt you pulled with Mr. Arrow... and so help me, you' il be joining him!
SlLVER:
You got something to say.
Scroop?
It' s that boy.
Methinks you have a soft spot for him.
SAhLORS:
Now, mark me, the lot of ya.
I care about one thing, and one thing only!
Flint' s trove.
You think I' d risk it all for the sake... of some nose- wiping little whelp?
What was it now?
"Oh. you got the makings of greatness in ya"
Shut your yap!
I cozied up to that kid to keep him off our scent.
But I ain' t gone soft.
ONUS:
Land ho!
There it is!
Feast eyes and click heels if you got 'em.
Where the devil' s me glass?
Jimbo.
Playing games, are we?
Yeah.
Yeah, we' re playing games.
Well, I was never much good at games.
Hmm.
Yaaah!
Ohhblast it all
Change in plan, lads!
[Cheering]
Strike our colors, Mr. Onus.
With pleasure, Captain.
Pirates on my ship?
I' il see they all hang.
Doctor, familiar with these?
Uh, no.
Ooh.
Mr. Hawkins!
Morph!
Oh, you' re taking all day about it.
Stop them!
Unh!
Rrr- yeah!
AMELlA:
[Screaming]
Did you actually aim for that?
You know, actually, I did.
Oh, blast it.
Doctor, when I say "now", shoot out the forward cable.
Morph. here!
[Whistles]
Morph.
Morph, come here.
Come here, boy.
Come here, boy.
- Morph!
- Morphy!
Ohh.
Whoa!
Jim!
Hydraulics engaged.
Come to papa!
We' il lose the map!
Captain!
Laser ball at 1 2 o' clock!
- Aah!
Oh, my goodness.
Unh!
Captain!
Uh- uh --
That' s all.
Cup of tea, and I' il be right as rain.
Mr. Hawkins.
The map if you please.
Ah.
[Giggling]
Morph!
Morph, where' s the map?!
It' s back on the ship?
Stifle that blob and get low.
CAPTAhN AMELhA:
We need a more defensible position.
Mr. Hawkins, scout ahead.
Aye, Captain.
- Steady, steady.
Shh. shh.
Oh, this is fantastic!
I just want to hug you and squeeze you... and hold you close to me.
OK.
Would you just let go of me?
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
It' s just I' ve been marooned for so long.
Don' t get me wrong.
For heaven' s sakes, after a hundred years... you go a little nuts!
I' m sorry.
Am I...
I am, um...
My name is, uh...
B. E. N.!
Of course, I' m B. E. N.
Oops.
- Jim.
Oh, what a pleasure to meet you, Jimmy.
- Anyway...
Look, I' m kind of in a hurry, OK?
I got to find a place to hide, and there' s pirates chasing me.
Don' t get me started on pirates!
I remember Captain Flint.
Wait, wait, wait.
You knew Captain Flint?
I think he suffered from mood swings, personally.
I' m not a therapist, and anyway... but l -- you let me know when I' m rambling.
But that means -- but wait.
But then you gotta know about the treasure?
- Yeah, Flint' s trove?
You know, loot of a thousand worlds.
It' s -- well, it' s... it' s all a little -- little -- little fuzzy.
Wait. l -- I r- r- remember.
I do. l -- treasure!
Lots of treasure buried in the centroid -- centroid -- centroid of the mechanism.
And there was this big door opening and closing... and opening and closing... and Captain Flint wanted to make sure... nobody could ever get to his treasure... so I helped him...
Aah!
Data inaccessible!
JlM:
BEN?
Aah!
Wait, wait, wait!
What about the treasure?
I want to say Larry.
I' m sorry.
I' ve lost my mind.
I' ve lost my mind.
You haven' t found it, have you?
Uh, my missing piece?
My primary memory circuit?
Look, B. E. N., I really need to find a place to hide, OK?
So I' m just gonna be, you know, moving on.
Oh, uh, so, well, then...
I guess, uh... this is good- bye, huh?
I' m sorry that I' m so dysfunctional.
I do understand.
Bye- bye.
Look, if you' re gonna come along... you' re gonna have to stop talking.
Ha ha ha!
Oh, this is fantastic!
[Clears throat]
Being quiet.
And you have to stop touching me.
That' s my two big no- nos.
Now, I think that we should --
Say, listen, before we go out on our big search... um, would you mind if we made a quick pit stop at my place?
Kind of urgent.
I think you just solved my problem
Uh. pardon the mess. people
You' d think in a hundred years...
I would' ve dusted a little more often... but, you know, when you' re batchin 'it... you tend to, uh, let things go.
Aw, isn' t that sweet?
I find old- fashioned romance so touching, don' t you?
How about drinks for the happy couple?
Oh, uh, ooh.
Uh, no.
Thank you, we don' t drink... and, uh, we' re not a couple.
Look at these markings.
They' re identical to the ones on the map.
I suspect these are the hieroglyphic remnants... of an ancient culture.
Mr Hawkins stop anyone who tries to approach.
Yes, yes.
Now listen to me... stop giving orders for a few milliseconds and lie still.
Go on.
Say something else.
Hey. look!
Hey, fellas!
Ooh!
SlLVER:
Hello. up there!
Jimbo?
lf it' s all right with the captain...
I' d like a short word with ya.
No tricks, just a little palaver.
Come to bargain for the map, doubtless.
Pestilential...
- Ugh!
- Captain.
That means... that he thinks we still have it.
Ah, Morphy!
[Groaning]
Oh, this poor old leg' s downright snarky... since that game attack we had in the galley.
Ahh.
Whatever you heard back there... at least the part concerning you...
I didn' t mean a word of it.
Listen to me.
lf we play our cards right... we can both walk away from this rich as kings.
- Yeah?
- Ha ha ha.
You get me that map... and, uh... an even portion of the treasure is yours.
[Chuckles]
You are really something.
All that talk of greatness...
light coming off my sails... what a joke.
Now, just see here, Jimbo --
I mean, at least you taught me one thing.
Stick to it, right?
Well, that' s just what I' m gonna do.
I' m gonna make sure that you never see... one drabloon of my treasure!
That treasure is owed me, by thunder!
Well, try to find it without my map, by thunder!
Oh, you still don' t know how to pick your fights, do you, boy?
Now, mark me.
Either I get that map by dawn tomorrow... or so help me, I' il use the ship' s cannons... to blast ya all to kingdom come!
Morph, hop to it.
Now!
Oh, blast it!
Gentlemen... we must stay together and... and... ohh.
And what?
What?!
We must stay together and what?!
Doctor, you have wonderful eyes.
She' s lost her mind!
Well, you gotta help her.
I' m an astronomer, not a doctor.
I mean, I am a doctor, but I' m not that kind of doctor.
It' s not the same thing.
You can' t help people with a doctorate.
You just sit there, and you' re useless.
It' s OK, Doc.
It' s all right.
Yeah, Doc!
Jimmy knows exactly how to get out of this.
It' s just Jimmy has this knowledge of things.
Jim, any thoughts at all?
Without the map, we' re dead.
lf we try to leave, we' re dead.
- lf we stay here -- - We' re dead!
We' re dead!
Well, I think that Jimmy could use a little quiet time.
So I' il just slip out the back door.
- Oh, yeah.
I get this delightful breeze through here... which I think is important... because ventilation among friends --
Whoa What is all this stuff?
You mean the miles and miles of machinery that run through the entire course of the inside of this planet?
Hey, Doc!
Jim, wait.
- I' il be back.
Woof.
[Snoring]
- Shh.
B. E. N., quiet.
OK, here it is.
[Muffled]
That' s a good plan.
The only thing is...
MORPH:
Oop?
- BEN. shh!
Sorry. sorry Sorry
You wait here.
I' il neutralize laser cannons, sir!
B. E. N.!
[Sighs]
What is the big deal?
All we gotta do is find that one little wire.
Oh, mama.
[Sighs]
[Alarm blaring]
OK, fixing.
That stupid robot' s gonna get us all... killed.
Aah!
Whoops OK. don' t panic
Breathing in breathing out
This has gotta be cannons.
Maybe not.
Come on, come on, come on.
[Snickers]
Oh, yes.
Do say hello to Mr. Arrow.
Tell him yourself!
[Gasping]
Morph?
Laser cannons disconnected
Captain Jimmy, sir!
Gee, that wasn' t so tough.
Doc, wake up!
I got the map.
Fine work indeed.
Aah!
What' s this sorry stack of metal?!
Not the face!
Ya hates to lose.
[Chuckles]
Open it.
I' d get busy.
Oh, the powers that be.
Would you look?
Tie him up and leave him with the others till we -- what?
You want the map... you' re taking me, too.
[Chuckles]
We' il take 'em all.
It' s OK, Morph.
Don' t worry.
Jimmy, l -- I don' t know about you... but I' m starting to see my life pass in front of my eyes.
At least, I think it' s my life.
Was I ever dancing with an android named Lupe?!
B. E. N., shh.
SlLVER:
We' re gettin 'close. lads
I smell treasure a- waitin '.
I see nothing!
One great, big stinking hunk of nothing!
What' s going on, Jimbo?
I can' t get it open.
We should' ve never followed this boy!
SlLVER:
I' d suggest you get that gizmo going again. and fast!
Let' s rip his gizzard right out right now!
Throw him off the cliff!
JlM:
The Lagoon Nebula?
But that' s halfway across the galaxy.
JlM:
A big door opening and closing
Let' s see.
Kinapis.
Montressor spaceport.
So that' s how Flint did it.
He used this portal to roam the universe stealing treasure.
SlLVER:
Where' s that blasted treasure?!
Treasure!
Treasure!
It' s buried in the --
Buried in the centroid of the mechanism.
What if the whole planet is the mechanism... and the treasure is buried in the center of this planet?
And how in blue blazes are we supposed to get there?
[Alarm beeping]
[Gasps]
The loot of a thousand worlds.
We are going to need a bigger boat!
This is all seeming very familiar.
I can' t remember why
B. E. N., come on.
We' re getting out of here, and we' re not leaving empty- handed.
Jimmy!
A lifetime of searching.
And at long last...
I can touch it.
Do you know what' s strange?
I can' t tell you how frustrating this is, Jimmy...
'cause there' s something just -- it' s nagging at the back of my mind.
- Captain Flint?
- ln the flesh!
Well, s- sort of, except for skin, organs... or anything that -- that -- that resembles flesh... that' s not there.
And yet it' s so odd. you know?
I remember there was something horrible
Flint didn' t want anyone else to know but h -- h just can' t remember what it was
Oh, a mind is a terrible thing to lose!
[Sobbing]
B. E. N., I think I just found your mind.
Aah!
Whoa!
Hello.
You know, uh, Jimmy, I was just thinking...
I was just think --
All my memories!
Right up until Flint pulled my memory circuits... so I could never tell anybody about his booby trap!
- Speaking of which...
- Huh?
Flint wanted to make sure... that nobody could ever steal his treasure... so he rigged this whole planet... to blow higher than a Kalepsian kite!
Run for your life!
You go back and help the captain and Doc!
lf I' m not there in 5 minutes, leave without me.
I am not leaving my buddy Jimmy.
Unless he looks at me like that.
No!
Oh, no!
Aah!
- Aah!
[Crew yelling]
Come back here, ya blighters!
All my life, I dreamed of an adventure like this.
I' m just sorry...
I couldn' t have been more helpful to you.
Oh, don' t be daft.
You' ve been very helpful.
I feel like such a useless weakling... with abnormally thin wrists.
[Belches]
I have a question.
ls it that your body is too massive... for your teeny- tiny head... or is it that your head is too teeny- tiny... for your big, fat body?
I pummel you good!
Yes, I' m sure you will, but before you do...
I have one more question.
Uhh...
SlLVER:
Jimbo!
Aren' t you the seventh wonder of the universe?
Get back!
I like you, lad, but I' ve come too far... to let you stand between me and me treasure.
Oh, no, you don' t!
What?
Jimbo.
Reach for me now!
Reach!
l -- I can' t!
I...
Oh, blast me for a fool!
Silver, you gave up?
BEN:
Jimmy!
Hurry, people!
We got exactly two minutes... and thirty- four seconds till planet' s destruction!
You' re doing fine, Doctor.
Aah!
We were better off on exploding planet!
Take us out of here, metal man!
Aye, Captain!
Captain, you dropped from the heavens in the nick of --
Save your claptrap for the judge, Silver!
Missile tail demobilized, Captain!
Thrusters at only 30% of capacity.
That means we' re --
We' il never clear the planet' s explosion in time.
- What?
It can get us out of here!
Pardon me.
Jim. but didn' t that potal open onto a raging inferno?!
Yes, but I' m gonna change that.
I' m gonna open a different door
Captain, really, I don' t see how this is possible --
Listen to the boy!
One minute, twenty- nine seconds till planet' s destruction!
- Just some way to attach this.
Stand back.
Stand back, now.
OK.
BEN:
Fifty- eight seconds!
Well, you heard him!
Get this blasted heap turned 'round!
Doctor, head us back to the portal.
Go to the right!
I know, I know!
Twenty- five seconds!
No!
Seventeen seconds!
Seven six five four three... two...
Wow!
Yeah!
SlLVER:
You done it.
Jimmy!
Ha ha ha!
[Cheering]
CAPTAhN AMELhA:
I' d be proud to recommend you to the interstellar academy They could use a man like you
Just wait until your mother hears about this!
Of course, we may downplay the life- threatening parts.
Jimmy, that was unforgettable!
I know you don' t like touching... but get ready for a hug, big guy, 'cause I gotta hug ya!
Hey, you hugged me back.
[Sobbing]
Does anyone have a tissue?
- I know.
You never quit. do you?
Ha ha!
I was merely checking to make sure... our last longboat was safe and secure.
Well... that should hold it.
Heh heh heh.
I taught you too well.
lf you don' t mind, we' d just as soon avoid prison.
Little morphy here, he' s a free spirit.
Ohh!
What say you ship out with us, lad?
You and me, Hawkins and Silver... full of ourselves and no ties to anyone!
You know, when I got on this boat...
I would' ve taken you up on that offer in a second... but, uh, I met this old cyborg... and he taught me that I could chart my own course.
That' s what I' m gonna do.
And what do you see of that pal of yours?
[Chuckles]
Why...
look at ya, glowing like a solar fire.
You' re something special, Jim.
[Clears throat]
Got a bit of grease in this cyborg eye of mine.
See ya around.
Morphy, I got a job for ya.
I need you to keep an eye on this here pup.
Will ya do me that little favor?
Aye- aye, Captain.
[Chuckles]
This is for your dear mother... to rebuild that inn of hers.
Stay out of trouble, ya old scalawag.
Why, Jimbo, lad... when have I ever done otherwise?
[Cheering]
[All cheer]
[Crying]
[Laughing]
It' s good to see the sun and feel this place
This place I never thought would feel like home
And I ran forever
Far away
And I always thought I' d end up here alone
Somehow the world has changed
And I' ve come home
To give you back the things they took from you
And I feel you now
I' m not alone
I always know where you are
When I see myself
Where you are
And I found something that was always there
Sometimes it' s got to hurt before you feel
But now I' m strong. and I won' t kneel
Except to thank who' s watching over me
And somehow I feel so strong
And I' ve begun to be the one
I never thought I' d be
And I feel you now
I' m not alone h always know where you are
And when I see myself
I always know where you are
Where you are
Now it' s all so clear
And I believe
That everything' s been opened up to me
And I feel you now
I always know
I always know where you are
And when I see myself
I always know where you are
And when I feel the sun
I always know where you are
And when I see myself
Where you are
So...
Take her wrap, fellas
Find her an empty lap, fellas
Dolly' il never go away
Dolly' il never go away again
Hey, do you guys know this one?
Now this is the real shit.
Shake your ass, watch yourself
Shake your ass
Show me what you' re working with
Attention all young players and pimps
Right now is the place to be
I thought I told y' all niggers before
Y' all niggers don' t fuck with me
Shake your ass
Watch yourself
Shake your ass
Show me what you' re working with
Shake your ass
You suck.
Who put the horse out?
She' s good.
She -- she' s been really sick.
Bad, bad, bad girl!
That' il be $1 7. 50.
Hey, pay the fare.
I' m Father McFeely.
I' m so glad you' re here.
I came as fast as I could, but at my age... the little soldier needs a lot more thumping... before it starts pumping, if you know what I mean.
I do find, though, if I tickle my asshole... just before I unleash the dog of war --
I understand.
You know, because in the old days... you know when you --
How is she?
It' s gotten worse, Father.
Really?
She won' t eat, she won' t talk.
Yes.
Sometimes you have to give them candy.
Father... the church sent me to assist you.
I' m Father Harris.
Nice to see you.
Would you like to see the girl?
Soon... but first I must bless this house.
"The sorrows of death compassed me...
"and the pains of Hell got hold upon me.
"I found..."
"Then called I upon the name of the Lord and..."
"My soul from death."
Please, Lord.
Help me to release this demon.
Thank you, Lord, the most merciful Almighty.
Oh, hold on.
Ah, those enchiladas.
Thank you, Lord.
Fuck this.
Fuck!
Look at this!
Please, Father, think of the child.
Fuck!
It' s freezing.
Let us pray.
"Defender of the human race...
"look down in pity upon this, your servant."
Shove it up your ass, you worthless piece of shit.
Silence!
"Holy Lord --"
Your mother is in here with us, Harris.
Yes.
Mom, will you get out of there, please?
You' re no fun.
I' m working.
See you later, Mrs. Harris.
"Holy Lord, Almighty Father in --"
"Everlasting God...
"and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ...
"and the Virgin Mary' s baby daddy.
"Holy Lord, Almighty Father...
"to the flames of Hell...
"to crush that roaring tiger...
"and who got that unholy bitch Jerri...
"kicked off of" Survivor -- "
Fuck me!
Father!
Father!
Huh?
This is not part of the ritual.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy --
All clean.
Oh, thank you so much.
You failed, McFeely.
Your weapons are useless against me.
BOTH?
Our Father who Art in Heaven --
Stop it!
Ha ha!
Zip it.
Thy kingdom come.
Ha!
Shit!
Suck on this.
Let you go like a dozen balloons
So you think you made it into the class, Shorty?
I sure hope so, Cindy.
You could use the grade, huh?
I need a place to stay.
Mom Dukes kicked me out, but you know something?
I learned something very important in college -- the value of books.
Really?
Look at this here.
Free paper.
Shit, son.
Yeah, so how you digging college?
I don' t know.
It' s OK, I guess.
I feel like such a geek sometimes, though.
Everyone is so cool, and I' m... not.
Oh, come on, Cindy.
You ain' t that bad.
Hmm.
Maybe some new gear.
"Gear?"
That' s slang for "clothing."
Come on.
We gonna cool you up right now.
Don' t sit like this, first of all.
- OK.
- Right up, son.
Yeah.
Now go like this.
- Yeah.
Now stand up, let me show you some moves.
Right, left.
Right, left.
Uh, son.
Right, left.
Right, kick.
Uh, son.
Uh, psych.
Throw a little bit of slang in there.
Ya mean? "
Yo, that jacket is tight, son.
- Ya mean?
Yeah, something like that.
Throw it all together.
Right, left.
Right, kick, uh!
Yo, that jacket is tight.
Ya mean?
That is the shit, dog.
You boners aren' t ready yet?
I' m telling you,
We 'il get there on time, all right?
Yo, dogs, what y' all think?
Tucked in or out?
Come on.
That' s what I thought.
You fuckheads would be ready if you weren' t partying all night.
It was so awesome.
We got so wasted, man!
I woke up naked in a tub of ice.
All right!
Yeah, man.
Oh, shit, Ray, you got a tattoo.
What' s it say?
"Ray!" Oh, man.
Oh, shit, you got a tattoo, too.
Dude!
Dude, what' s it say?
"Fucked me."
"Ray..."
"Fucked me."
- "Ray..."
- "Fucked me."
"Ray fucked me."
What, man?
Ha ha!
You' re gonna give me a yeast infection.
Hey, girl, that jacket is slamming.
Thanks.
You better be careful, though.
Some girl got an ass- whipping... over a jacket stolen earlier today.
Some people is so ghetto.
What class we got next?
Psychology.
1 01?
Oh!
This is too much.
I got these psychic powers on line.
Remind me to get a lotto ticket tomorrow.
Oh, don' t split the pole now.
My psychic told me.
You don' t really believe in that stuff, do you?
Very much.
Are these all the subjects?
Yes, sir.
I took the liberty of putting... those with near- death experiences on the very top.
Any of them hot?
I gave them special consideration.
Oh, good thinking, Dwight.
Traumatized coeds are a sure thing.
Ooh, I like her.
Oh, yes, sir.
That is Cindy Campbell -- classic abandoned personality disorder.
She seems guarded, but willing.
And this?
That is Ray Wilkins, sir.
I couldn' t quite figure him out... but he seemed very eager and pleased to meet me.
What' s this?
It' s a picture that he sent after the interview.
Where did you find these kids?
Sir, they' re all survivors... of the Stevenston County Massacre.
Oh, fantastic!
These kids are exactly the catalyst we need... to awaken the spirits of Hell House.
Sir, exactly how are we going to get them up there?
We' il tell them... it' s part of the class.
We' il say -- excuse me -- that they' re participating in a study... of sleep disorders.
We are going to make history, Dwight -- the first documented... unrefuted evidence of life after death.
Welcome, everybody.
I' m Professor Oldman.
Each of you have been carefully selected... to be in this class... for which you receive an automatic grade of "A"... upon completion.
Now, this year' s study is insomnia.
We are going to spend the weekend together... where we' ve established a controlled environment... in which we' il study your various sleep disorders.
Now, I' il be passing out directions --
- No.
- I can do it.
I can... myself... do it.
Now, you should all be there... by 6 p. m. tonight and plan to stay through Monday.
I' il see you all this evening.
Hey!
Oh.
I' m Cindy.
- Hey.
So, looks like we' re gonna spend the weekend together.
Yeah.
You want to get together and study or something?
Ha!
That was kind of bad.
I' m sorry, Buddy.
You seem like a really nice guy... but I just got out of a really bad relationship... so I' m not quite ready to start dating yet.
But, hey, you know, maybe we could be friends.
Cool.
See you later, friend.
All right, pal.
Smell you later!
As we go on, we remember
All the good times
We had together
As our lives change
Come whatever
We will still be
Friends forever
Will you shut the fuck up... and let me sing?
Hello?
Hello?
Look at you.
I' m not little.
Check it out.
You ever seen a bird dick this big?
Too much for you, huh, baby?
Yeah.
Step off then, sweet cheeks.
Come back when you want some real loving.
OK.
Fucking tease.
Hello?
Oh, I' m -- I' m sorry, child.
Did I frighten you, child?
Are you scared?
I' il sing to you.
God is in his holy temple
Better?
I' m here with Professor Oldman' s group.
I' m the caretaker.
- Hi.
And what' s your name, sweet child?
I' m Cindy.
Cindy.
Oh, but the resemblance is striking.
Look at the thin cheek bones and the same lips.
Same -- same eyes.
Look at your hair.
Oh, I' m sorry.
You' ve got the same nose.
Tickle, tickle.
Be- boop, be- boop on the nose.
Oh!
That' s heavy!
- Oh!
No, that' s fine.
Look, you got the panties --
I can take care of it.
Look at -- Oh, what you got here?
Can' t forget your toothbrush.
Gonna need that for later.
Follow me, child.
- Watch my bottom.
Coming through.
Right this way.
Here we are.
So, um, do you live here by yourself?
Well, yes.
We' ve tried to rent it out... but people don' t seem to want to stay very long.
Oh, there' s old Mother Kane... and that' s old Master Kane.
Who' s that?
That' s Big Daddy Kane.
Oh, he' s cute.
Oh, yeah.
That was the master' s favorite toy.
I don' t know what it' s doing out here.
I swear.
Sometimes I think... these toys have a mind of their own.
Right this way.
Not that room, sweetheart.
That was the master' s mistress' s room.
Yeah, he kind of was a little bit of a hornball.
You go and stay right over here.
This was the room that belonged to the love of his life... his wife, Caroline.
Oh!
My fanny' s coming through.
Make room for fanny.
It' s beautiful.
Well, thank you, child.
You know, I have been working out.
I' ve been doing my bun busters every day.
I squeeze really tight, and then I let loose.
I squeeze really tight... and then let loose.
Look at this.
Caroline looked beautiful in that dress.
In fact, she always looked her best.
Do you know that she used to entertain... for royalty and common folk and... even the President of the United States.
Ew.
Oh, don' t be frightened, child.
This is just Mr. Kittles.
He was the master' s favorite pet.
He' s been in the family for generations.
He hasn' t aged a day.
All right, child, I think I' il take my leave.
You let me know if there' s anything you need.
Yes, and as you can see, Professor...
I' ve taken care of everything... including medical supplies and blood storage.
We want to be safe.
Are these cameras all throughout the house?
I thought that would be best.
So if one of our little chickadees... were to be taking a shower... which button would I press to get a closeup?
That one.
This one?
Excuse me, Professor... but your guests have begun to arrive... and supper shall be served shortly.
Thanks, handyman.
I' m actually the caretaker.
Oh, aren' t those cool new skates?
Now, you be careful with those.
Don' t want to fall and break something.
That' s real funny.
Let me give you a hand.
Well, that -- that' s awful kind of you.
How about you give me a standing ovation?
Why don' t you lift me up?
I see where you' re going with this one.
Were you in "Stomp"?
Hey, you can kiss my grits.
I think I' il be the bigger man now and walk away.
Walk away.
- OK.
- I' il see you shortly.
Sounds good.
I' il just run upstairs and jump into my jogging suit.
I' il be right down.
Hey!
How you doing?
Fuck off, four eyes.
I beg your pardon?
I said, "Fuck off, four eyes."
Hey!
Hey!
It' s just a bird.
Polly want a cracker?
Polly wants your mama' s sweet ass.
What did Polly say to me?
I said, "Polly wants your mama' s sweet ass."
You don' t be talking about my mama, son.
You don' t know my mama, son.
I fucked her last night.
I' il fuck you up!
I' m shaking.
Now, fuck this.
I' m gonna handle this shit like a gentleman.
Yo, hold my tooth, son.
Yeah, come on, bitch.
You and that "Welcome Back, Kotter" haircut.
Bring it on.
Give me some.
What?
Then do it.
Let me out of here.
I' il fuck you up.
Hi, guys.
- Hey.
Hey, Buddy.
- How you doing?
Come on.
You got to be quicker than that, "A" cup.
- Hey!
- How you doing?
Well, are you boys just gonna sit there... with your mouths open... or is someone gonna offer me a seat?
I warmed it up for you.
It' s the best seat in the house.
Second best.
Yes, it was reported but never substantiated.
All right.
Well, uh... who' d like some appetizers?
- Yeah.
That' s what I like to hear.
Hey, these buns look good.
Oh, yeah... and they' re so soft and warm.
- Oh, I' m sorry.
These are delicious.
Thank you, my child.
I made them by hand.
I think the taters are just about done.
I' m just gonna give them one quick whisk here.
Dig in.
All right.
Now it' s time for the turkey.
Oh, what a beautiful bird.
- No, man!
Hey, man.
Why don' t you just relax... and just let me do that for you?
- Rest that little hand.
It' s my pleasure, but what a nice young man to offer.
Let me give you a little pinch there.
Come on.
Fuck it!
You know, a lot of people... are kind of intimidated... about making a turkey, but... really it' s very simple.
You just have to know the anatomy of a turkey... and it' s got, over here... just the tiniest little stinkhole... but it' s big enough to get your hand... right up inside it.
Uh!
Stuff the shit out of it.
I cook it with all the giblets -- the penises and the ginies...
And now, a lot of people like to baste their turkeys... but I use this.
I lick like that... and get into the little... hiney... hiney ho...
That' s nice and good.
I don' t know what the hell that is... but I' il lick it anyway.
Up and down... and then I like to get that right on there...
And I got one of these.
I' m gonna pull that off... and bam!
That just kicks it up a little bit.
I think that' s almost... ready now.
And then we bring it to the table.
Mmm, good.
All right.
Who' s ready for a wing?
Yours or the turkey' s?
I just thought that was funny.
Well, I know what you' d like.
How about a leg?
Ha ha!
How about I take these two legs... and shove them right up your ass -- all the way to the knee!
Dwight, relax.
Hanson... may I ask you is there something on the menu... that you haven' t personally prepared?
Well, I ordered out the dessert.
Make room.
All right.
Huh?
I see you eyeing the first piece.
Mm mmm.
Thank you.
That' s nice.
Ha, ha, ha!
Ha, ha, ha!
Ha, ha, ha!
Come play with me.
Come play.
Hello?
Cindy.
Who is it?
I want to help you, Cindy.
Who are you?
You' re in danger, Cindy.
I want to help you.
Who' s in danger?
Check the music room.
Where are you?
Check the fucking music room!
Hey, Cindy, think fast!
Dude, you suck!
Yeah, I think it is so cool having a girl as a friend.
That' s just it, Buddy.
I am a girl.
You can' t be so rough with me.
Well, then what the hell are we supposed to do?
Gentle stuff.
You know, like talking and... sharing secrets and past experiences.
You know, stuff like that.
That sounds kind of gay.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Will you come check something out with me?
We can practice our talking.
Exactly.
I want to tell you about this thing... that happened to me when I was in high school.
What happened?
This hot Spanish chick' s licking my nuts --
Buddy!
This is the best part.
Look.
Someone' s on the rag!
They lead straight to the bookcase.
God.
Must be a secret study or something.
Oh, my God.
It says Hugh Kane and his mistress... were murdered in this house.
Check this out.
This must be his wife.
She looks just like you.
You think?
- Yeah.
Well, actually, her hair doesn' t have... as many split ends as yours... and her skin isn' t as oily as yours, either.
Also, sometimes your eyes get kind of squinty... and you look like you might have Down Syndrome.
Other than that, though, the resemblance is uncanny.
Really?
Also, her tits are perfect.
They' re not pointy or funny- looking like yours... or spaced too far apart.
Enough!
God.
Oh, my God, look at this.
"Caroline."
Must have been hers.
All right.
Let' s get out of here.
OK.
Grab the chest.
- Buddy!
- What?
- Right.
What the --
Nice.
Hello!
If I had known, I would have freshened up!
I wish you were freshened up, too.
Come on!
Oh, you want this?
Ooh, yeah.
That' s it, daddy.
Take it like you want it.
Give it to me!
Come here!
Bring it on!
Kinky' s my middle name, bitch!
Oh.
Mrs. Huey Kane.
Hmm?
Doesn' t that just have a ring to it?
Mmm... baby?
Where you going?
Call me!
Hee hee!
Like what, Ray?
I don' t know.
Why don' t you talk dirty to me?
I don' t know what to say, Ray.
Just make something up.
Oh, Ray, why do you make me so bad?
Because you a bad girl.
OK.
I' m gonna work this.
Work it.
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.
I' m gonna piss on your face... and then I' m gonna fart in your mouth.
And then I' m gonna shit on these walls, Ray!
Hey!
Too dirty?
Hello?
Oh, hey, kitty, kitty.
Hi, little fella.
OK.
That' s OK, cat.
I think I know why you' re mad, Mr. Cat.
I didn' t mean to go poopie in your litter box.
My pussy' s gone crazy!
You want a piece of me?
How do you like that, little pussy?
Come on!
Is that all you got?
Come on!
Give me your best shot!
I' m telling you, Professor... it was possessed.
Theo, did you see this animal?
No, I didn' t.
I heard all the commotion... but by the time I went in there...
I guess it was gone.
So you think I did this to myself?.
No.
All I' m saying is that cats are known... to be very territorial animals... and it' s likely that it did attack... but that doesn' t mean it was possessed.
Maybe you two should sleep together.
What are you getting at, Professor?
I' m just saying that if indeed this cat did attack... it' s less likely to come back if the two of you were...
let' s say... together.
Oh, come on, it' s college.
It' s time for you two to experiment.
I don' t think we' re gonna be getting much help here.
Oh, on the contrary, actually...
I' d be more than happy to walk you through it.
Come on, Cin.
I' il make sure you get tucked in.
Good idea.
Don' t forget to kiss each other good night.
There' s something going on in this house, Professor.
I' m not crazy!
1, 2... 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... 9, Brandon, 1 0... 1 1, Brandon, come on!
Count with me!
Come here a minute.
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Come here.
Peekaboo!
Come on, let' s play!
This is a fun game, huh?
Hey, what are you doing?
Uncle Ray- Ray' s got a game.
Hey, get your finger out of there.
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle...
You want to play with Uncle Ray?
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Help!
RAY:
Here' s a little balloon animal.
"I can' t take living with him any longer.
"He' s becoming a monster.
"I suspect he was having an affair.
"I believe he' s sleeping with our baby- sitter Victoria.
"because we have no children."
Cindy...
I want you to know what happened, Cindy.
Hello, Cindy.
Hello, Professor.
I take it you' re not mad at me anymore.
I wouldn' t go that far, Professor.
Why don' t you just relax?
Hey!
I think she' s starting to suspect something.
Who?
Your wife.
Oh, my God.
It happened right here.
What?
She came home.
- Saw who?
I was in my room reading her journal.
Then I found this dress in the closet.
That' s all I remember.
What about you, Ray?
Oh, I bought mine on Friday.
I just came down to get a banana.
Shit is hot, right?
You' re a nice little plant.
You drink all this little water up... so you can grow up to be a nice strong charon plant.
Yes.
And then you' il be smoked by all the rappers... and make them do a whole lot of dumb shit... that fuck up their careers.
Yes, you will.
Night- night, baby.
I' m gonna rob that bitch tonight.
A Hip- Hop Christmas.
As "Santa Claus Is Coming on Moms..."
That' s the shit, son!
"I' m Dreaming of a White Woman..." and who could forget "Frosty the Dopeman"?
And how about "All I want for Christmas...
Is the Charges Dropped... "
"Deez Nuts Roasting On an Open Fire..."
"A Sleigh Ride In My '64..."
"Ante Up, Bitch, It' s Christmas..." and many more!
Yo, I' m gonna buy that shit, son!
95...
I didn' t mean to smoke your relatives!
No!
I didn' t do it by myself!
Please!
Aah!
Shit, son!
Please!
Oh, shit!
Oh, my God!
I smell something burning!
It' s me!
I got an idea!
Oh, wait a second!
Hold on, Shorty!
Don' t rescue me yet.
I' m getting high as a motherfucker!
Take it to the head!
Take it to the head!
Oh, you take it like a bitch.
Put the Shorty down... and I' il give you Funyons and Cheetos.
Oh, shit!
This shit burns more than a perm!
There' s a whole lot of freaky shit... going on in this house.
There' s more to this story than the Professor told us.
Last night, I found a secret room... and I found all these newspaper clippings... about Hugh Kane.
He was a really evil man.
And I found a picture of his wife.
She looks just like you.
You think?
She doesn' t have as many split ends... and her skin' s not as oily as yours.
Yeah.
Sometimes you do this little squinty thing with your eyes.
It looks like you got Down Syndrome or something.
Oh, yeah, y' all look just alike... except she got some perfect boobs... and yours look like them old orangutan titties.
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Enough!
Anyway, I think she killed him... and now he wants me.
Right, bitch.
Let me help you.
I don' t need your help.
I can do it myself.
Professor, uh, we need to talk.
What is it, Dwight?
I think you should consider... cutting the experiment short.
What?
This poltergeist is growing increasingly more violent.
I think we' re all in danger here... and I' ve got to put my foot down... and stand up for what I believe in... and say that we' ve got to pull the plug.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Dwight.
I say when we pull the plug.
We are on the verge of greatness... and I am this close to getting laid.
Now, the bus arrives on Monday.
No one leaves till then.
Here are the keys to the gate.
No one gets access to them.
Yes, sir.
Guys, I think the Professor' s up to something.
I heard Dwight tell the Professor... there could be a poltergeist in the house... and that we could all be in danger!
Not a poltergeist!
What' s a poltergeist?
No.
The gates are locked.
Dwight' s the only one who has the keys.
- I' il handle --
Get my Vaseline, a banana, and some duct tape.
I' m gonna break his legs.
I' m gonna fuck that little cripple up!
Guys, just give me five minutes alone with him.
I' il get the keys.
Hello, Dwight.
Hi, Theo.
What you working on?
Uh, just a little experiment.
Work, work, work.
Is that all you ever do?
Well, there' s a lot riding on this project.
You know, the Professor... might have everyone else fooled... but I know who the real brains... behind this operation is.
You do, huh?
That' s what turns me on about you.
Ahh.
And those sexy eyes.
Why don' t I put some music on, huh?
Music.
You know, Dwight...
I hear you' re the only one... who has the keys to the gate.
I' m --
What if...
I wanted to borrow those keys?
Oh, dear sweet God in Heaven.
I... yaaa, I can' t.
Yes, you can, baby.
I mean --
You help me by giving me the keys... and I' il help by giving you... [Zip]
Whoa!
Hey, I don' t need your help, OK, lady?
I can do it myself.
Hey, look!
I' m tossing my own salad!
So this is your secret room.
Well... this just isn' t gonna work now, is it?
Oh, Professor.
Come over here.
This way, you big hunk.
Have we met?
Follow me.
Are you playing a little game?
Where are you?
Come here, baby.
- Yeah.
- Oh!
He' s not gonna let us out of here!
He' s gonna kill us!
A rocket scientist.
Everybody to the laboratory.
Hurry up!
You all are fucked!
Lock the door.
That' s great.
How are we gonna destroy what we can' t see?
I got it!
We' il shave off our pubic hairs... and wear the shampoo for two weeks!
Listen.
We' re gonna use these guns.
They emit a bolt of concentrated energy... which can damage the ectoplasmic cells... and destroy the ghost.
Now, there' s no more ammunition.
Use it wisely.
- Ow!
Hey!
My bad.
Now, the only way... we' re gonna be able to track these ghosts... is if we' re all wearing one of these.
These are thermo goggles.
They work on the principle of body heat.
They' re so powerful, they can detect... where any bodily fluids have been... even if they' ve been wiped clean.
What?
Are my glasses crooked?
Now listen, that ghost may be invisible... but we have the advantage of being armed... with the most sophisticated high- tech equipment... known to man.
How do we stay in touch with each other?
Do we have some walkie- talkies?
We have these.
Those is Dixie cups.
Well, we kind of ran short of funds... after the guns and the goggles.
Uh- uh!
Hold up!
How come every time some scary shit happens... that we need to stick together... you white people always say, "Let' s split up"?
Yes!
That' s what I' m saying!
She' s right.
You three, follow me.
Ain' t that a bitch?
We' re gonna die, y' all.
Did you hear that?
Hell, yeah.
Where' s Shorty?
I don' t know.
Shorty!
Oh.
You wait right here.
I' il be right back.
- All right.
- What is this?
I don' t know.
Looks like the furnace room.
- No, wait.
In that newspaper article... it said that Hugh Kane was killed in the furnace.
Oh, wow.
There' s so many ashes, Buddy.
What are you doing?
Hold it.
I' il meet you on the other end.
- Wait.
Good luck.
I love you!
- Cindy!
There' s a monster chasing me.
What are we gonna do?
- Yeah?
Shorty!
Why does the little bitch... got to bring that shit over here?
Well, maybe she won' t see me.
Brenda!
OK.
Thank you, Lord!
Now let that shit just -- just mutilate her white ass and leave.
Oh, my God, Brenda!
We' re gonna die!
It would have just been you... if you had just shut the fuck up!
It' s coming!
What is it?
Is it a monster?
Cindy?
This is bones.
Would you run from Calista Flockhart?
Shut your ass up.
He crazy now.
Here.
Psych!
Have a nice trip.
Hey, girl, I got an idea.
Come on.
Very funny.
Now get on out of here!
Somebody gonna catch an ass- whupping... when I come back.
Oh, Brenda, you are so brave.
You know, you really are my best friend, Cindy.
You guys OK?
- Please.
It takes more than a little bag of bones to scare me.
Wedgie!
The ghost has Buddy!
My ass!
Brenda, do something!
OK!
I thought I was your best friend.
Was.
I' m gonna miss you, girl!
Get my gun!
Are you OK?
Oh, my God, you' re bleeding.
I think there' s a first- aid kit in the lab.
Come on.
Huey... baby... where are you?
Are you there?
Baby!
Baby, I got to talk to you.
- Baby?
Get away from me!
We can work this out.
I mean, if we just stick together... no one can hurt us, my love.
It was just a booty call!
Why won' t you talk to me?
Because you gave me crabs.
Good- bye!
Hey.
Ha, ha, ha!
No kissing.
Leave this on.
You look beautiful just like that.
Oh!
No, no, no.
Ohh.
I' ve been thinking about this whole friendship thing.
I' ve never had a friend... who cared for me the way you do.
I mean, there' s Ray... but he cares for me in a different way... you know, like bringing me flowers... and running my bath water.
And there' s nights when I wake up screaming... and I look over, and Ray' s in my bed holding me.
Anyway... seeing as how tonight may be our last night together...
I was thinking --
That we should take our friendship a little bit further.
- Oh, Buddy!
I was thinking the exact same thing.
This might be our last night alive... and I want to take full advantage of it.
I was thinking the same thing!
I want to be able to act out our innermost fantasies.
Oh, great.
Like...
I' ve always wanted to walk on the moon.
Huh?
Buuuuudyyyy.
What do you want to do?
He' s in here.
He locked us in.
You should call for help.
Can you hear me?
Come in!
Do you copy me?
We have a situation here!
Breaker!
Oh, my God.
They can' t hear me!
Must be these walls or something.
All right.
I' il go check upstairs.
OK.
- Do you need help or -- - No!
OK.
What do I look like to you?
Just trying to be nice.
Cover me!
What do you want me to do?
Cover me!
I' m serpentining!
Two years.
Spent two years on my belly in Danang.
- Look!
Look what the cripple' s doing.
Oh, shit.
Just let me help you up --
Step it back, candy pants!
Fine.
Oh, what are we gonna do?
I' m cold.
I can' t feel my body, I' m so cold.
Buddy, can you feel this?
No.
Try a little higher.
What about that?
Ohh.
Oh, Buddy, I don' t think I' m re --
It' s a matter of life and death.
I' m asking you... in the name of love.
OK, Buddy.
In the name of love.
Oh, Cindy...
I don' t know how much longer I can hold on.
Don' t you say your good- byes.
You' re gonna get out of here... and you' re gonna go on... and you' re gonna have lots of little babies.
And you' re gonna die an old man...
Old man.
Warm in his bed.
- No.
- Amen.
- Oh, yeah.
Coming to this house was the best thing... that ever happened to me.
Oh, me, too.
And for that...
I am so thankful.
Oh, don' t let go.
I' il never let go!
- Buddy!
- I' m com -- - Come back!
All right, Dwight Hartman... it' s your time to shine.
Come on.
Come on, Kane.
Show yourself!
I don' t even need my thermal goggles.
That' s right, mother --
Hey, Kane, you hungry?
How about a little snack of this?
Gotcha!
I know what you' re thinking.
Did I fire 3 shots or 1 1 7?
Well, do you feel lucky... punk?
Do you... feel lucky?
Do you feel lucky, punk?
Shoot me, motherfucker!
Fine.
Make your best move, ass bite.
Help!
Help!
Take my hand.
Come on.
You' re gonna fall unless you take my hand...
Give me your other hand.
My other hand isn' t strong enough.
You take my little hand.
Get it away from me!
Take my hand!
Why me?
No.
Don' t you do this to me.
Please, no.
Ple- ple- ple -- Aah!
OK, Buddy.
It' s time for us to get out of here.
Come in, Roger.
Ray, this is Cindy.
I don' t want to talk to Cindy.
I want to talk to Roger.
Quit fucking around.
The ghost is close.
Buddy' s hurt.
- I' m right behind you.
Where' s Shorty?
I don' t -- I don' t know.
He was here just a minute ago.
Listen, you go help Buddy in the lab.
- All right.
That smells good.
Hello, Cindy.
Say heloo to Cindy, Shorty.
Heloo... Cindy.
Shorty, are you OK?
Talk to me!
Chloroform?
You drugged him!
That' s all his stuff.
Yaah!
All right, Shorty.
Who' s ready for the main course?
Me.
Oh, Hanson, please.
Oh.
What the fuck?
Beetlejuice in the house.
Hee!
Shorty!
Got me.
Cindy, what' s going on?
He' s possessed.
Let' s get him.
Angel style!
OK.
Oh, nooo!
Shit.
You OK, Dwight?
I -- I can' t feel my legs.
I can' t feel my legs!
You never could.
You stay out of this, all right?
Now listen.
You get the others and meet us upstairs.
- OK.
You stay here.
Give me your belt.
The crane.
The crouching tiger.
The drunken monkey.
The mad cow.
Moo!
The camel toe.
Get the hell out of there, guys!
Come on!
Ray, give me a 1 80.
Listen.
Someone has to go... and lure him onto that platform.
I' il go.
Cindy, let me --
No, Buddy!
I' m the one he wants.
Actually, I was saying...
let me have your computer if you die.
But as soon as he gets there... you have to get off.
OK.
1 80 me.
Hugh Kane, it' s me you want!
Come get me!
I' m not afraid anymore!
Show yourself!
Do something.
She' s still on the platform.
If I throw the switch, she' il die.
You' il get killed!
Move out of the way!
I' il get her!
Why is he running so slow?
Run faster!
OK!
Throw the switch!
Now you will be mine... forever!
Ray, you saved me.
Are you OK?
I' m fine.
I broke my fall.
What' s going on?
You' re alive!
It was traumatic.
It really was... and it' s taking me a while to get over it, but, you know... now that we' re out of the house and back in school...
I just know that everything' s gonna be OK.
Oh, God, will you shut the fuck up?
Why couldn' t you have just left me there to die?
I' il hang myself.
I' m hanging myself.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Dad.
Are you having fun on your vacation?
Birds are very clean animals.
He' s no trouble at all.
Goddamn it!
What the fuck did you put in this birdseed?
I got to go.
Bye.
God, that was a big one.
- Surprise.
Open chest!
You got to be quicker than that, pencil dick.
Come on.
A bee.
Buddy, I' ve never had anyone... be so protective of me before.
That' s what your man' s supposed to do.
Two hot dogs.
Buddy, get him!
Buddy?
I' ve come back for you.
This can' t be happening!
It is happening.
Now we' re gonna be together forever.
Nooooo!
Yes!
Did you hear something?
I didn' t hear nothing.
(bell rings) (woman) Everyone, please take your seats.
Last week, the assignment was to write an essay about your family.
- Who they...
- (class) Are!
And what they... (all) Mean to us!
Excellent droning.
We' re going to read them aloud to the class right up here.
My mom says that me and my dad have very healthy appetites.
My mom and dad are very religious.
When they' re in their bedroom at night, I always hear them yelling, "Jesus!"
My mom says my dad' s eyes are brown because he is so full of sh... (teacher) Brian!
My brother Jack is in eighth grade.
He told me to ask my dad who he voted for... for... for President.
I did and my Dad said he' s a total Bush- man.
That made my brother laugh really hard.
Whenever my Uncle Stu comes over to play pool with my dad, my mom says the basement smells like a Cheech and Chong movie.
Well... it' s like this.
I checked, but he didn' t poop it out.
(class laughing)
Maybe your dog can eat the zero you' il be receiving too.
- Aw, man!
Miss Trinke?
My dad says life can be split into two categories:
New Jersey... and New York.
(music playing)
(girl) My dad was a Jersey boy who became the youngest and most successful music publicist in New York City.
By the time he was 27, he had 100 people working for him.
And even though they all loved him, he loved them even more.
My fellow flacks and spin doctors.
(girl) Daddy loved his job, but not as much as he loved my mom.
Mommy was a book editor in New York City when her and Daddy met.
Daddy said theirjobs were kind of the same... they made slight corrections for their clients.
Because George Michael is a pimp who is all about the ladies, my friend.
Come on, "I Want Your Sex"?
Daddy worked so much that sometimes Mommy could only see him late at night.
Daddy says that' s why they both loved the city so much - it never went to sleep.
And neither did him and Mommy.
Daddy said it was time to show Mommy where he came from.
So he took her home to New Jersey and put her through what he said was the biggest test their love would ever face:
- Hey, how are ya?
- How' re ya doin 'yourself?
Hi.
- And what do you do, Mr. Trinke?
- Easy on the "Mr. Trinke".
It' s Bart.
He' s the only man in Highlands licensed to operate the street sweeper.
Oh, man, I always wanted to ride in one of those things.
Well, you continue seeing my son, I can probably get you a turn at the wheel.
I was only gonna sleep with him a few more times and then dump him, but now, after an offer like that...
Listen to the mouth on this one!
Oh, yeah, they don' t make 'em like Mom anymore, do they, Dad?
- Now, listen, I' m goin 'to the bar.
lf you guys are gonna do anything while I' m gone, stay the hell off of my bed.
- You' re going to a bar?
- Didn' t he tell ya?
I' m an alcoholic.
- Well, I wanna go to the bar too.
It' s a bunch of old guys talkin 'about how good they had it under Kennedy.
The man was a goddamn saint.
I' m goin 'to the bar with your dad.
No, that' s OK.
I only cooked.
Suit yourself.
I got a layer of juice built up for the pork roll, and I don' t want you scrubbin 'it off.
That "juice" is called grease, Dad.
It' s called juice.
And it greases a father' s insides so that he can better swallow the shit his son feeds him twice a year when he can be bothered coming to visit him.
(girl) So that night, Daddy took Mommy to Pop' s bar, where she got to meet Pop' s other children, his best friends Greenie and Block.
Hey, your kid' s cuttin 'a rug.
Who are you, Connie Chung?
Daddy said, because Mommy survived her first trip to Jersey, he knew she was a keeper.
He said they celebrated their engagement by going out for pizza.
And that' s how I got here.
lf you' re gonna steal something, steal some rubber gloves.
- Thank you!
And with that, everyone lived happily ever after.
Almost.
Look, you' ve got two minutes, and then we have to go, OK?
- Or I' m gonna leave.
- Would you stop rushing me?
I don' t understand how somebody who had all day sitting around to get ready waits till 20 minutes before we have to leave!
This is one of the few days of the year that I can be fired for being late!
Anytime that you wanna carry this baby, Ollie, you let me know!
I would be glad to go back to wearing regular dresses instead of this tent!
The dress looks fine.
It' s beautiful.
Yeah, until I' m standing next to Janet Jackson or Sheryl Crow.
Gertie, I asked you, please, to use your own brush, OK?
- Can you just not use my brush?
- Don' t start.
I spend 1 5 minutes taking these long, bushy hairs out of my brush.
And I mean, you ask me to... (crying)
Baby, I' m sorry.
You don' t understand what it' s like to be this fat!
I' ve always been thin, and now I' m a disgusting pig!
And it' s my first time going to the Video Music Awards and all the other girls are gonna be skinny, and I' m gonna look like a whale!
Baby, baby, they' re just skinny 'cause they' re all coked- out whores.
I wanna be a coked- out whore!
You can be a coked- out, coked- out whore.
- I should be more sensitive.
I know.
- I know.
- Baby, we have to go now, OK?
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Just give me two minutes.
- (Ollie) What time is it?
- (man) 20 after.
- She' s gonna kill me!
OK.
"Madonna trusts the public will judge for itself that... this latest in a long line of breakthrough music videos is not the tasteless sexploitation it' s accused of being."
- "It' s artistic expression."
Of one woman' s constant need to show the world... her labia.
Hey, can I use the word "labia" in a press release?
See you next week.
One of these days, I' il get me one of those husbands that show up for Lamaze.
So you were late because of another woman.
That' s nice.
I still gotta do my job.
- And I still gotta do mine too.
Look, all I' m saying is that guy who used to spend all night at the office and barely live in his apartment?
That' s not you anymore.
Now you have to be the guy who' s done by six and comes home and hangs out with his family.
OK?
- OK.
- OK.
- Can I help you?
My wife' s water broke.
She' s gonna have a baby.
- You' re gonna have to check in, hon.
Where, at the concierge desk?!
First of all, take your hands off my uniform.
And second, I' m gonna need a patient here.
This is my wife.
This is the belligerent nurse that' s being so difficult with me, giving me such a hard time.
He' s a little panicky.
- Can I get a wheelchair?
- Let' s get you up to delivery...
- OK. -... and let him fill out the paperwork.
- lf we can trust him with a pen.
OK, just relax, breathe.
I love you.
- I love you too.
It' il be great.
You' re doing good.
I can' t do it!
- It hurts!
Push.
(doctor) Take a deep breath.
- OK?
Push harder, Gertie.
The baby' s crowning.
I just need one more push.
- Can you see her?
- (doctor) One more.
Push!
Push!
(doctor) Here she comes!
Here she comes!
- Do you wanna cut the cord, Dad?
- Yeah.
And she' s got all ten fingers, ten toes.
We' il get her all cleaned up and then we' re gonna check...
Gertie?
- Gertie?
Gertie, can you hear me?
Sweetheart?
(Ollie) She' s resting.
Who' s Dr. Mortimer?
- What' s happening?
- (doctor) She' s unresponsive.
Gertie!
(doctor) Healthy baby.
- (doctor) Respiratory arrest.
- (nurse) Turn it around!
- What' s happening to my wife?
Baby, are you OK?
Please, someone take Mr. Trinke outside.
Please!
Gertie, wake up, my love.
Gertie, please.
Get off me!
I wanna stay with my wife!
Gertie!
- Ollie...
- lf I don' t get to go in there right now...
Ollie, calm down.
OK?!
Your baby is fine.
She' s healthy, she' s normal.
- What' s wrong with Gertie?
OK?!
I' m calm.
We think Gertie had an aneurysm.
ls she OK?
We lost her, Ollie.
The strain of the contractions and the pushing caused the aneurysm to rupture.
_ You drew the bird that was here
(Ollie) You sure you' re OK with this, Dad?
What, OK?
Yeah, you can stay with me anytime, can' t you?
Yes, you can.
Until you' re a teenager, with the boys and a reefer.
Then I don' t wanna know about you.
I just got a lot of work... piled up from before and...
- I' il be back late tonight, OK?
Your daddy really misses your mommy, kid.
I miss her too.
(knocking)
Yeah.
- You wanted to see me, Ollie?
I didn' t think you were gonna be in this week.
- You all right?
Look, this piece in the Post.
Why didn' t you call me when this broke?
- It' s cool.
Will she still be a fan when the Enquirer flashes a stack of 50s in her face?
Listen, something like this breaks, I' m not in the city, you find me or you find another job.
What else do we got?
Um, Will Smith.
- Who?
- The Fresh Prince?
"DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince" Fresh Prince?
You remember the first album, the one with "Girls Ain' t...
- Rock the House.
You remember on the cover of the album Jazzy Jeff is holding a model of a house?
Will Smith is donating that house to the Hard Rock Cafe.
Well, stop the presses.
- Date pending, yeah.
- Every outlet wants in.
- You' re kidding me?
Why?
Doesn' t matter.
He' s got that movie coming out in a couple of weeks, Independence Day.
- Let the film division handle it.
Will wants to keep his music career separate from his movie career.
Like the Fresh Prince of Bel Air is ever gonna have a movie career.
Get me everything you can.
I' il put together a press kit on him, and we' il just do it.
- Patty, get me Kirsch.
I can handle this Fresh Prince stuff if you wanna take a couple of days...
I' m all set, OK?
Patty, did you not hear me?
I asked you to please get Kirsch on the phone.
- (Patty) I' m trying.
I know I told you at the funeral, but I' m really sorry...
I' m fine.
I am fine!
- Kirschner on one.
Put him on the phone then!
- How' s the baby?
Forget about the baby!
(Kirschner) Jesus Christ, Ollie!
- (turns intercom off)
(baby crying) (Ollie) I' m working on that right now.
Hey!
Can you deal with that?
Thanks.
What the hell could be more important than your kid crying?
I have a memorabilia donation ceremony in the morning that my company is treating like a royal wedding
'cause apparently the client' s the most beloved American musician since Elvis.
lf it bothers you so much, go up there and give her a bottle.
Sorry.
Jesus!
Let me call you back, OK?
- What, Dad?
So I get how you' re feelin '.
You were married for what, 20 years?
So you don' t "get" how I' m feeling at all, OK?
I' m sorry, Oliver, but that don' t change the fact that you' re a goddamn father now and you haven' t acted like it since that kid got home from the hospital!
I been calling in sick for a month to do the things you' re supposed to be doin '!
Jesus Christ, if Gertie could see the shit you' ve been pulling...
Gertie doesn' t see anything anymore, Dad.
Yeah, she' s dead.
(baby continues crying)
It' s nothin '.
All right, so I' m gonna do the kit.
What time' s Will getting there?
(crying continues)
Dad!
(Bart) What the hell...?!
Are you nuts?
What, are you trying to get killed?!
- Searching for Christ.
It would have been nice if you' d told me you were leaving the house!
That way, I could' ve given you the baby instead of driving all the way down here!
- Now I' m gonna hit traffic!
Hey!
Excuse me?
I got uptown and downtown to do this morning.
- You' re on your own with the kid today.
I have this press conference I have to do this morning, Dad!
You know that!
- I got a job to do too.
- lf I don' t leave right now...
- So leave!
- And do what with the baby?!
- Take her with you!
Look, I know I haven' t been helping out that much with the baby...
Listen to you, "Helping out that much with the baby."
She' s your daughter, for Christ' s sakes!
- What am I supposed to do with her?!
Goddamn it!
Folks, I' m sorry.
Steve.
- I ordered diapers.
Did they get here yet?
Why didn' t you start half an hour ago?
You shouldn' t have waited for me!
- We' re waiting for Will.
- Will' s not here?!
- No.
- Are either of you guys Trinket?
- Close enough.
Damn!
(Arthur) It' s a good thing you finally showed up, man.
- They' re gettin 'all rowdy out there.
- What?
Ollie, the guy from Rolling Stone...
Grow up, Susan!
What did the Rolling Stone guy say?
lf we don' t start in five minutes, they' re leaving to go cover the Blues Traveler signing at Tower.
- Jesus Christ!
- Hey, you' re doing that wrong.
You' re supposed to wipe front to back.
You' re wiping back to front.
You do that, you' re just wiping the poop into her..... crevice.
Beat it!
Mark my words, you' re gonna give her the crotch- rot.
- Would one of you do...
No.
Why, because I' m a girl?
Fine.
I' m gonna remember this.
- How much of this am I supposed to use?
- Should I get that guy back?
You gotta turn... turn it.
Oh!
Go out there, please, and tell them we' re about to start!
I' d say more.
That' s a lot.
All right, the Fresh Prince is almost here.
ls that blow on your shirt?
What do you think, Stretch?
This is show business, right?
- That was a joke, people.
- The Fresh Prince is on his way.
- (baby crying)
- It' s crying.
No.
This is bullshit!
Where' s the Fresh Prince?
Enough with the Romper Room, man!
(chanting) Fresh Prince!
- (chanting continues)
Give her to me!
Would you people just shut the hell up with the "Fresh Prince" already?!
He' s a two- bit TV actor... who won' t be around any longer than it takes for the ink to dry on the pages of the worthless rags you jerk- offs write for!
Shit.
(_ "Swing Low Sweet Chariot" by George Jones) (baby crying) _ Well, I looked over Jordan
_ Swing low, sweet chariot _ Coming for to carry me home _ Swing low, sweet chariot _ Coming for to carry me home _ Coming for to carry me home
We won' t be here too long, Dad.
We' il be out of your hair as soon as I get another job.
I have some feelers out to the other firms right now.
As soon as this whole thing blows over...
It' s OK to stay here as long as you need to, till you get back on your feet.
- I appreciate that.
- On one condition.
- You put the kid to bed every night.
- That' s it?
And no whores.
I' m not really a whoremonger, Dad.
Here, the kid gets this.
That' s cute.
Just shut the hell up and go be a father, would ya, please?
No?
(clears throat) Yeah, this is only temporary, us... you know...
So... how about that Fresh Prince thing, huh?
Your dad' s one big horse' s ass.
Daddy' s ex- bosses said the guys who did PR for Hitler have a better chance of working in this business again than Daddy does.
So, OK...
How' re you doin '?
You know, you kinda look like your mom.
Like a squishier, balder version of your mom.
Man...
I just wish you could' ve gotten to meet your mom.
I know she wanted to meet you... in a big, bad way.
ln a big, bad way.
Sometimes, Daddy wishes he' d have died instead of Mommy.
Because Mommy never would' ve...
let work get in the way of... getting to know you,
like Daddy has for the last... month or so.
It' s just that Daddy... he didn' t expect Mommy...
(sighs) to leave the way she did.
It' s just really hard on Daddy, who' s been trying to fill up his days with work, so he wouldn' t have to think about Mommy never being around again.
I just loved your mom so much.
She really lit my world on fire.
When that happens... you kinda think it' il go on like that until one of you dies.
I miss her so much.
And you' re a little piece of Mommy.
Just don' t go anywhere.
'Cause you' re the next best thing to Mommy, and I love you so much.
And I' m sorry about the way I' ve been acting.
I promise you...
I' m gonna be the best daddy in the world.
'Cause that' s what Mommy wanted.
And that' s all I am now.
I' m just your dad.
Your dad likes to run off at the mouth sometimes, I know.
Your mother wasn' t a fan, either.
You wanna see a picture of your mom?
This was your mommy.
OK.
Daddy' s got a bunch.
There you go.

Your chariot awaits, Princess.
Argh! _ To fly in the sky
- How was school, good?
- Mm- hm.
Remember to put your seat belt on?
Know where to find it?
Comin 'around.
- Ready?
- Can we go see Cats?
- Absolutely not.
Why?
Cats was the second- worst thing that ever happened to New York City.
- Besides, Cats closed three years ago.
You' re ridin 'in the Batmobile, aren' t ya?
How cool is that?
Oh, my God.
Look, no one' s more depressed than me that driving the street sweeper is considered the height of excitement in my life.
I used to live in New York City.
I could' ve gone to see Cats three times a day.
- Oh- ho- ho!
"And the Oscar goes to Gertie Trinke, for her performance in Laying It On Thick For My Old Man."
What is it with you and Cats all of a sudden?
I wanna sing a Cats song in the big show, like everybody else.
- What big show?
All the people have to sing a song with people from their family.
- Duh!
I' m sure that' il go over huge with your pop.
Can Uncle Greenie and Uncle Block be in it too?
Those men are not your uncles.
They' re barely even your peers.
- When is this big show?
- Right before Thanksgiving break.
I don' t think so.
ls Cats in the Bible?
- What?
- When you taking her to see the cats?
Jesus, you too?
Do you even know what Cats is, Dad?
- What, I don' t read the papers?
- You don' t read that paper.
What are you doing with a New York Times?
They ran out of the Ledger.
They don' t have the Jumble in the Times, Dad.
Shit.
- Where were you?
- I was in the bathroom.
- Why didn' t I hear the toilet flush?
OK, march your butt back upstairs and flush that toilet.
And when I say no about something,
like, I don' t know, Cats, maybe, I mean no.
OK?
- Pop, you were supposed to be subtle!
You' re gonna have to mow the park for me tomorrow.
I can' t do it.
- Why the hell not?
- I have an appointment in the city at 1 1: 00.
Jesus, kid, why do you keep doin 'it to yourself?
How many of these interviews you gotta go on before you get it through your thick head they don' t want you in that business anymore?
For Christ' s sakes, you made fun of that Prince Charles guy.
First of all, Dad, I didn' t "make fun" of anybody.
I made one remark about Will Smith, the Fresh Prince.
Sooner or later, everyone' s gonna forget about that and I' m gonna go back to doing what I' m really good at, instead of sweeping streets and plowing snow and picking up garbage.
lf you' re going into the city anyway, at least take the kid to see the cats.
(Ollie sighs)
I' il tell you what, since there is no more Cats,
Gertie, why don' t you come over here and pick out another play that you wanna see?
Anything you want.
Go nuts.
- Cats is a show?
You think you' re slick, don' t ya, young lady?
Next time you' re lookin 'for a partner in crime, you' re gonna have to aim higher than your grandfather.
- (whispers) He' s soft in the head.
Here.
Sweeney Todd?
Do you know that this has a lot of singing?
- OK.
I' m just checking.
Your dad one time lost a bet with someone at his work, and he had to go see a singing play, done by people on roller skates.
- Cool!
- Your dad didn' t think so.
(Ollie) I handled primarily recording artists but when I initially trained, I trained in film PR, so I can do that too.
I, uh... took the last six or seven years off.
But I kept abreast, so...
What else can I tell you guys?
That' s it.
- You guys all right?
The one who used to work at MandellKirschner?
- Yes!
- (Reynolds) I got it.
- Am I missin 'somethin'?
Nah, nah, he just bet me you were the Ollie Trinke, the one who pulled "The Fresh Prince".
- They named it?
Are you kidding?
You did what every flack only dreams about doing!
- Which was what?
You trashed your client back to the Stone Age.
- Yeah.
- You' re like a god around here.
- Yep, exactly.
- God enough to get a job?
- No chance, Trinke!
- Pop, I' m home!
- (Bart) Yeah, like I give a shit.
- That' s what it looks like?
- I guess.
- What does yours look like?
Yeah?
Let me see.
(Ollie) Gertie!
OK...
- What are your intentions?
What are your intentions with my daughter?
- Do you plan on marrying her?
- I don' t know.
Well, only married boys and girls, ahem... show each other their, uh... their, you know, uh..... parts.
lf you come back, come back with a ring.
Yes, Mr. Trinke.
- Bye.
OK.
Do you have any, uh... questions about what you... you know... you know, whatever, saw?
Do you have what Bryan has?
Yes, I have one... too.
ls yours as big as his?
Sadly, yes.
- Can we rent a movie?
- So they wouldn' t give you a job, huh?
You don' t need that job anyway.
You already got a job.
Yes, well, Daddy used to have a job where a nightly shower was an option, not a necessity.
- You know what job you should do?
- What' s that?
Should I say, "Nobody puts Baby in a corner"?
Oh, can we rent Dirty Dancing again?
Dirty Dancing ranks one notch below Cats in my book.
Can you pick out something else?
Can we rent this?
Absolutely not.
Go pick out something from the children' s section.
- All those movies suck.
Nah, that' s...
I' il just take this and whatever the kid' s getting.
Just go ahead and put it in the bag.
I' m all set.
"Bi- Bi Guys, featuring Curious Jordie"?
lnteresting choice.
It' s...
I got the...
- I got the wrong box by accident.
- Oh, right.
Would you mind, uh... exchanging that for me for something... anything you can get your hands on that' s, you know...
- So, then you want something...
Can I have your membership card, please?
Do you mind if I asked you a few questions about your renting practices?
Uh... sure.
Do you always rent adult titles with your daughter in tow, or is this the first time?
Excuse me?
When you rent porn, do you usually do it with family around, or is this like a, you know, special occasion?
- I' m a grad student, writing a thesis paper.
The Family Man and the Pornographic Fixation ".
OK.
I would rather not take part.
Frank, is Bi- Bi Guys a one or a two- night rental?
- What are you getting, Daddy?
Let' s just take a look...
Would you mind not asking me those questions when my daughter' s with me?
How about when you bring these back?
ln an effort to get honest feedback, leave the kid and the wife at home.
My mom' s dead.
She died when I was born.
Man, I' m sorry.
I didn' t...
Let' s go.
Major Damage didn' t have to go to bed when he fought the Tiki Terrors!
- And do they...
You will not.
- (Melvin) But, Mom!
- (mom) Say, "OK, Mom."
Hey!
Let' s not use that term too loosely, OK?
Yes?
I just wanted to come here and tell you that I' m really sorry about earlier tonight.
I feel like shit about what I said and your daughter and everything.
Well... you should.
You know that kid was crying in the car the whole way home?
- Oh, no...
- Get back inside and watch your video!
See, now you have to let me interview you for my paper.
ls that why you' re here?
I just think you' d make one hell of an interesting case study.
The sympathetic widower who doesn' t have time to date 'cause he' s raising a kid, so he rents porn instead.
Jesus Christ!
And besides, I' d really like to make it up to you.
For what I said, and for embarrassing you before that.
You' re really having a banner evening.
You' re Ollie, right?
"Hi, Maya.
Nice to meet you. "
Hi.
You do eat lunch when you' re not knee- deep in adult movies, right?
I appreciate it, but, uh... no thanks.
Ollie, come on, you' re ruining my karma level here.
What, buying me one lunch is gonna square you with Krishna?
ls Monday OK?
I mean, I was thinking nothing fancy.
I was thinking maybe, like, the diner.
- Around noon?
Noon it is!
Oh...
An incredibly strange woman.
I did not hear the toilet flush.
Thank you.
- Can we get popcorn?
This is Broadway.
This is class. _ And if you' re beautiful _ What then? _ With yellow hair like wheat _ I think we shall not meet again, my little dove _ My sweet Johanna
_ Goodbye, Johanna _ You' re gone and yet you' re mine _ I' m fine, Johanna _ I' m fine (Ollie) OK.
You see that floor.
Now look three windows in from the right.
That' s where we used to live before we lived with Pop.
We' d still live there if we lived in the city.
- lf Mommy was still alive?
- Dad...
- Yes?
I do.
- What was she like?
- I' ve told you a million times.
- I know, but I forget.
I think you just like to hear me tell you.
It' s all right.
You can ask about your mommy as much as you want.
Well, she was pushy, like you were right there.
She was beautiful, like you are right now.
And she was... smart... and strong, like you' il grow up to be one day.
I know.
I wasn' t impugning your intelligence or anything.
What' s "impugning" mean?
Oh, not so smart now, are you?
- That' s a big word.
Let' s see.
Pop' s always impugning you, right?
Well, he thinks he is.
Pop is a very, very old man.
What do you think?
It' s OK.
But I like Highlands better.
My school' s there, and my friends...
Well, if memory serves, you can rent movies here too.
Yeah, but not from that pretty lady at the video store.
- Oh, you think she' s pretty, do you?
lsn' t that why you' re taking her on a date?
The only girl I take on dates is you, OK?
This is a date.
We' re on a date.
- Mm- hm.
- It doesn' t feel like a date.
Well, I can fix that.
(Maya) So, uh, question one:
- Do I really have to do this?
- You have nothing to be ashamed about.
lnterest in adult film can be healthy, as long as it' s not habitual.
- So come on, how often?
OK, maybe I was wrong.
You should be ashamed.
You have a real talent for making the subject feel open and comfortable in a safe environment.
So you' re renting it presumably to masturbate to, right?
- Good God!
- Come on, don' t be such a tight- ass.
I know I' m an adult.
How old are you, exactly?
You still haven' t learned some things aren' t polite to talk about in public?
lf it makes you feel any better, I do it, like, twice a day.
- What can I tell ya?
I get bored easily.
Don' t get all judgmental with me.
You' re no slouch yourself.
- Well, no, I...
- I just have a healthy sexual appetite.
Why don' t you go out and get yourself a boyfriend?
Why don' t you just go out and get yourself a girlfriend?
I work all day, I hang out with my kid all night.
So you' d rather hang out with your kid than get laid?
- Aw... that' s kinda sweet.
I' m kinda crushin 'on you right now, Trinke.
Can I go home now?
No.
I would rather not disclose that information.
Oh, come on, don' t clam up on me now.
Anonymity doesn' t concern me.
Embarrassment does.
- Why would you be embarrassed?
- Because it' s been a long time.
- How long?
Own it.
Just put it out there.
I swear I won' t make any editorial cracks about it.
- Seven years.
Since my wife died, yeah.
You know, a dumbfounded, mouth- agape look of shock might be construed by some as an editorial crack too.
- I' m sorry.
No, it' s not.
With all due respect to your wife, you' ve gotta get back on the horse, man.
- No, I don' t, actually.
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don' t.
Get up.
- With this, for now.
But come with me.
- Where are we going?
- To your place.
- No.
I' m very flattered.
What' s the matter?
Don' t you think I' m cute?
- Of course I think you' re cute.
Look, I' m not just celibate because of my daughter.
There are a lot of emotional issues in it too.
I mean, my wife may be dead.
Hey, I respect that.
I' m not telling you to fall in love with me here, and I' m not trying to replace your wife.
I' m just talking about two consenting adults having some casual sex.
Probably some really short casual sex, with you being a little out of practice.
- I can' t do it, I' m sorry.
God!
- You rent porn and touch yourself, right?
- Would you lower your voice?
lf you' re not sweating how your wife would feel about you and porn, then you shouldn' t sweat what I' m proposing 'cause it' s the same thing.
Only somebody else is doing the touching and you' re saving a $2 rental fee.
Man cannot live on porn alone.
Oh, God...
I' m home!
- Oh, my God...
(shower running)
- Pop?
- Uh, no, honey, it' s me.
Daddy?
Uh, because I had to come home and do...
I had to... come home and take a shower.
- Can we rent a movie?
As soon as I get done up here and dry off, I' il come down.
OK.
Oh, my God.
What do we do now?
Shh!
Hi, honey.
You remember Maya.
- What are your intentions?
- Excuse me?
What are your intentions with my father?
Uh...
Because I was taught that only married girls show their girl parts to boys.
- Right, Daddy?
Yes.
Can we rent all the movies we want for free?
What?
Yes, yes.
lf it means we' re not, you know, that we' re not in trouble anymore.
Yes!
Even Dirty Dancing?
Yeah.
And we can do Sweeney Todd for the show at school?
What?
We can do Sweeney Todd for the show at school?
- No, honey, that' s too grown- up.
- Really?
Oh man, what am I gonna tell Pop about you guys?
Fine.
We can do Sweeney Todd for the show at school.
Would you shut the hell up already?
Christ, Greenie, you' re always...
Christ Almighty.
Just as long as you didn' t do it on my bed.
Oh, Jesus Christ, it was one time in high school!
I banged a broad in my parents' bed once.
Just so you know, we didn' t "bang".
- What, did ya get to third base?
Not that it' s any of your business, but we didn' t do anything.
We lost our heads for a second, then cooler heads prevailed and we stopped before we did anything we' d both regret.
- Oh.
Let' s talk about something else for a second, like this water main.
- How bad is it?
- Definitely needs to be replaced.
Jesus Christ. lf we gotta shut down Bay Avenue for that, this town is gonna throw a shit fit.
Hey, kid, you haven' t had to inconvenience the taxpayers on the job yet.
They get like animals.
Remember back in '88?
Holy shit, I thought they were gonna crucify us upside down.
- Like St Peter.
- Who are you, the Holy Father?
Everybody knows I meant St Peter.
You don' t have to explain my shit.
I' m just saying...
When I was down there, how many cars did you wave around?
Three or four cars for the whole half hour I was down there?
Well, it was rush hour.
Yeah, I don' t think the legion of commuters in the Highlands of New Jersey are gonna object to us closing down a small portion of Bay Avenue for a few days.
- (gavel banging) - One at a time, please!
- We' re doing the best we can.
Why doesn' t somebody just go up there and explain to them what' s happening?
Why don' t you do it, Daddy?
Making people like singers by saying nice things about 'em?
- Yes, baby, but...
- No, the kid' s got a point there.
As a guy who used to sling bullshit for a living,
I nominate you to go up there and say something.
- Oh, you do, huh?
- It can' t hurt.
Thanks, Pop.
(angry shouting) (comptroller) Control yourselves!
He' s goin 'up there.
Folks, one second.
My name' s Oliver Trinke and I' m with the borough.
(chuckling)
I want to assure you that, uh... this Bay Avenue job will be a very minimal inconvenience.
Bullshit!
Folks, a little decorum!
Folks, one second.
I just have one more thing that I just want to add.
I see you guys headin 'to work every day.
(Ollie) I' m telling you, it was amazing!
And I get up there and I weave this web of bullshit so profoundly mesmerizing,
- I turn the entire place around!
Everything I was saying was just right on the money, you know?
Maybe that' s' cause you weren' t actually slinging as much bullshit as you thought.
"Get out there and play in the dirt"?
I made that up!
Sounds pretty good to me.
Hey, Gert.
The sad thing is, I had a greater sense of accomplishment from the water- main thing than anything else I' ve done in the past seven years.
I get it.
So you feel drunk with power now.
That' s just it.
I was the youngest flack ever put in charge of its entire division... (both)... in the history of MandellKirschner.
- I know.
Convincing a town to approve something that' s already in their best interest?
- That' s just delayed common sense.
- Yeah, but that' s your life now.
I mean, being the youngest flack in the history of blah, blah, blah... that' s not you anymore.
Oh, it was me.
It was me with my own apartment, me richer, me with more self- respect.
I mean, forget about what you thought you were and just accept who you are.
- I guess I' il just get this.
I distinctly remember your father telling you you could get Dirty Dancing.
- Oh, yeah!
Thanks for that, by the way.
lncidentally, she' s been asking me when she' s gonna grow boobies like yours.
- Oh, my God!
lf you want, I can give her the old "boobie" talk my mom gave me when I was a kid.
Does that talk include using the word "knockers"?
I' m glad there' s no, you know, awkwardness between us.
After the... well, the thing that happened last week with...
The moment passed.
It' s no big deal.
(sighs)
(electric saw)
- No, that' s too round.
Shut up!
- Would you shut the hell up?!
There' s people gettin 'their throats cut in this thing.
Yep.
And your father said you could do this for the show?
Why the hell would he OK you singing this shit?
Because I saw him and Maya naked in the shower.
Heh- heh!
That' il do it.
(Ollie) Can I speak with an Arthur Brickman, please?
- Hey, man.
How are you?
You know, the town voted unanimously, approved the water main, so...
You were always great with a crowd.
Well, except that... that once, of course.
But that' s it.
It was like I was on the top of my game.
Which is why I wanted to see ya.
- Uh, I wanna ask you a favor.
ls there any way that you could get me an interview with your firm?
You' re serious?
- Oh, I know it' s gonna be tough...
- Tough?
Ollie, you called a roomful of press a bunch of jerk- offs, and trashed a client who' s one of the biggest movie stars on the planet.
- He wasn' t big then.
You wanna know how big?
When I left MandellKirschner, there were some firms that wouldn' t even look at my resume because I...
I' ve only been at Angellotti a year now...
Forget I asked.
I got carried away...
- No, let me finish.
I' ve been waiting years to be in a position to be able to help you out, and now I am.
It' s not gonna be an easy sell, but...
I think I can get you in a room with Angellotti himself.
- Thank you so much.
You know, you' re a lot more affectionate than I remember.
Ah, it' s just...
I miss it so much, you know?
Oh, this is great.
I can put Gertie in a really good, expensive private school...
I can get her a nanny, you know?
It' il be like that whole Fresh Prince thing never even happened.
I' il work on the old man when I get back to the office and call you tonight if it' s a go.
Oh, great.
- (piano) - (Gertie) _ Excuse me
- (Ollie) _ Psst - _ Dear, see to the customers
- _ Psst - _ Guess what' s the...
- _ Quick now! - _ My heart' s a- flutter
- (phone rings) - _ When I pound the floor _ It' s a signal to show that I' m ready to go _ When I pound the floor...
Come on, Pop!
Do Dad' s part.
- Yeah.
Hello?
You' re kidding?
_ I' il pound three times Three times...
Why do I have to sing your dad' s part?
I' m supposed to be the guy who gets clipped.
- You are, but you' re Dad' s understudy too.
- What the hell is that?
It means if Daddy breaks a leg, then you do his part for him.
- So, come on, try it again.
- You' re doin 'good. _ I' il pound three times... _ Three times!
Wait, wait, wait!
I' m supposed to be the understudy now.
I' m sorry.
- This is no way to run a show.
- You were good.
You can go back to waiting in the wings, Tommy Tune.
I' il be doin 'my own singing henceforth.
- Who' s Tommy Tune?
- Tommy Tune is a man that you can get a chance to see live and on Broadway when we move back to New York City!
- What?
- What?
I was just on the phone with an old friend that I worked with at MandellKirschner.
I had lunch with him and I asked him if he' d get me an interview with his new firm.
Jesus, another interview, Ollie?
Come on, when are you gonna learn?
Well, smart guy, he just called me, said he sat down with his boss, sold me to his boss like I was the cure for cancer.
It just so happens that a little spot has opened up in their music department.
Boom!
After six years of being a pariah,
I' m gonna get back in!
I' m talkin 'about no more street sweeper, no more picking up garbage, and no more water main!
I' m talking press lines, I' m talking about parties!
I' m talking about a Westside address,
I' m talkin 'about a good school for Gertie!
Yes, honey, but you' re gonna go to a way, way better school in New York City.
You' re gonna be able to take the subway to school.
Won' t that be fun?
- Well, they are.
What do I tell you?
He makes things up!
- You' il see.
I don' t wanna go to a school up in the city.
I wanna go to my school.
Honey, it' s gonna be too far of a drive for me to come back down here to take you to school in New Jersey every morning.
So let' s not move to the city.
Sweetheart, I' m too old to be living with my father.
I need to get my own place.
I mean, look at him, he' s a mad- dog.
He doesn' t want us around here getting in his way, crampin 'his style...
- Do you, Pop?
- That' s all horseshit.
I don' t wanna move to the city.
Pop says you can live here as long as you want.
Baby, remember when I took you to see Sweeney Todd?
I mean, if we move to New York City, we can do that every night!
Except for the nights you' re working, of course.
Why don' t you shut up for a second, OK?
You love New York City.
You told me you loved the city.
- I said it was OK.
I said I like Highlands better.
Why would you want some other job anyway, Dad?
Baby, Daddy doesn' t wanna drive the Batmobile!
Daddy wants to eat sushi!
Daddy wants to hail cabs!
Daddy wants to have a doorman!
Daddy loved his old job, and he' s missed it every day since he' s been gone.
Daddy wants to do that job.
Daddy doesn' t wanna pick up garbage forever!
But you told everybody at the meeting that your job' s good because you don' t have to wear a suit.
Yes, but Daddy was just saying that to get them to say yes to a water main.
Look, OK, I' il tell you what.
I' il go to the meeting, all right?
lf I don' t like what the man says, then I won' t take the job.
All right, look, young lady!
I' m gonna go to this job interview on Monday, whether you like it or not.
Wait, this Monday?
- Yes.
- Ollie, you can' t go on Monday.
- Why?
Oh, shit.
Well, it' s at four, so I can, you know, make it back in time.
But my show' s at five!
On what planet are you gonna get back here by five if you' ve got a meeting in the city at four?
How could you forget?
What, are you stupid?
What about my show?
lsn' t that important to you?
Then don' t go to your stupid meeting about your stupid new job in the stupid city!
- That' s enough, young lady!
- I don' t even want you in the show!
Pop' s way better.
Even Uncle Greenie and Uncle Block are better than you.
Oh, no, but we' re good enough to build sets for her show, right?
Sorry, I didn' t mean that.
I don' t wanna be around you!
I don' t even want you to come to the show to watch it.
- I don' t!
Hey!
Hey, young lady!
You can' t tell me what to do!
I don' t have to do anything you say!
- Why?
Because I' m your father, that' s why!
- So what?
- Don' t you yell at me, Gertrude!
Blah, blah, blah!
All right, that' s it!
I hate you!
I wish you' d died, not Mommy!
You and your mother took my life away and I just want it back!
God, I' m sorry.
I didn' t mean...
- I' m sorry...
(_ "Landslide" by Fleetwood Mac)
_ Well, I' ve been afraid of changing _ 'Cause I' ve built my life around you _ But time makes you bolder _ Children get older _ And I' m getting older too
- Hey.
What happened to you the other night?
You just sort of took off.
It looked to me like you guys needed a little privacy.
She' s a kid, Ollie.
I mean, in a few years, you won' t be able to keep her out of Manhattan.
But for now, she just wants what she knows.
So do l.
Oh, Jesus.
You want your old life back.
Big- money job, out of your old man' s house...
It' s not like it doesn' t make any sense.
So?
I mean, this is their life.
What you' re sort of saying to everybody who loves you is that what we have isn' t good enough for you.
So it' s just upsetting everybody, you know?
- Everybody?
I mean, it' s not like we' ve got some big romance going on or anything.
We' re just friends, right?
Did you ever wonder if... maybe someday it might... be more than that?
For about two seconds, before you had me hiding in the shower from your kid.
I' m not gonna be all heartbroken 'cause you' re leaving town.
I know.
I' d still come back down here and visit my old man.
I mean, you think I' m gonna stick around here for much longer?
- Maya...
I gotta get back to work.
lf... if I don' t... if I don' t see you at the show, give me a call sometime when you get all settled up in the big city.
_ Now there' s tears on the pillow _ Darling where we slept _ And you took my heart when you left _ Without your sweet kiss my soul is lost, my friend _ Tell me, how do I begin again?
Hi, Daddy.
I' m sorry.
I didn' t mean to wake you up.
I' m sorry - for yelling at you the other night.
And I didn' t mean any of the things that I said.
I know.
- Daddy?
- Yeah?
Yeah, she did.
Then I guess I' il love it too.
Thanks, sweetheart.
You know, I still might make it to your show tomorrow, if the traffic' s not too bad.
I won' t be mad if you miss it.
Go back to sleep.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night. - _ (chorus) With these hands - _ I pray for my strength, Lord _ (chorus) With these hands With these hands _ Come on, rise up _ Come on, rise up _ Come on, rise up _ Come on, rise up _ Come on, rise up _ Come on, rise up _ Come on, rise up
George Clooney' s office for Tony on line one.
The Angellotti Company.
One moment, please.
My name' s Oliver Trinke and I' m here to see Arthur Brickman and Mr. Angellotti.
OK.
Mr. Trinke is here.
OK, I will.
- They' il be about ten more minutes.
- You can have a seat.
Oh, my God...
Hi!
Yes!
He apologizes, but he' s stuck in traffic He' s just a few blocks away.
Why don' t you just have a seat and I' il let him know that you' ve arrived.
They love to keep you waiting, don' t they?
- They love to keep you waiting.
Right.
I think they think it gives them a psychological edge, you know?
Well, it' s about to give 'em the edge of my ass,
'cause that' s all they' re gonna see when I' m walkin' out that door.
You know anything about these guys?
"... firm in the business."
All right, well...
You know as much as I do.
Unless these publicists hire other publicists to get the word out for 'em.
Right.
And then those publicists hire their own publicists to help spin the good publicity they created for these publicists.
Of course, knowing publicists, they probably hire publicists to promote the fact that they spun the publicity that they hired the other publicists to spin.
So...
So what do you do?
I didn' t realize I was sitting here talking to an Angellotti man.
Well, to tell you the truth, I' m not an Angellotti man.
These guys have been tryin 'to steal me from my publicist since my last flick.
- Oh, the robot movie, right?
I haven' t gotten around to it yet.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks a lot for the support though, man.
- You know what?
I have a kid.
I don' t get a chance to get out and see movies unless they have singing crabs in 'em.
That means you have a girl.
That' s right.
- How old is she?
Cool.
I got a girl and two boys.
God.
How do you find time to make all those blockbusters?
Shoot, if I didn' t have all them damn kids,
Right.
Oh, man.
- It' s cool, though, isn' t it?
- Making blockbusters?
- Bein 'a parent, funny man.
It has its moments.
- What' s your daughter' s name?
Damn!
Why' d you do that to that girl, man?
- Did you lose a bet?
- "Was"?
She took you for half after she saddled the kid with the name Gert?
I can' t blame it on her.
She died in childbirth.
- No, no, no, it' s...
- I feel like an asshole, man.
- Don' t worry about it.
I didn' t see your movie, so we' re even.
This is exactly why people don' t talk to each other in waiting rooms, right?
Probably.
Although, I gotta tell ya... the fact that the guy who wrote "Parents Just Don' t Understand" is now a parent completely makes up for it.
We don' t though, do we?
- What' s that?
From the door, man, they got it all over us.
My daughter has it all over me, I can tell you that.
Yeah, my middle one, my son?
Every time I walk out of the house in the morning he says, "Daddy, how far you love me?"
I always pick somewhere close.
You love me all the way to the moon and back down to the dirt. "
It take everything I got to walk out of that house.
You get to spend time with them on the set though, right?
But if I was a smart man, I wouldn' t be sittin 'here right now.
I' d be at home playing in the dirt with my kids.
But we all know that I' m not famous' cause of my brains.
It' s' cause I' m, like, strikingly handsome, crazy sexy.
And I' m, like, hung like it' s ridiculous.
But I' m definitely not the sharpest spoon in the shed.
You know...
- It was really nice talking to you.
- You out?
- I' m out.
Uh... only guy I can recommend is named Arthur Brickman.
Other than that, I can' t vouch for anybody.
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
I' m just a guy who' d rather play in the dirt with his kid.

I' d like to welcome everyone to Saint Maria Goretti' s
This is a celebration of your children and their talents, so we hope you enjoy the show.
Our first act is first- grader Cynthia Bodnar and her mother Jane, performing the song "Memory" from the Broadway show Cats.
And now Tracy Colelli, from Sister Ann' s kindergarten class, will perform with her parents "Memory" from Cats.
And now, first- grader Martin Tobias and his mother will perform...
Oh, boy, this is a popular song.... "Memory" from Cats.
You gotta be kidding me!
You couldn' t make it easy on me, could you, Gert?
Honey, it' s gonna be OK.
You' re next, Gertie.
And now, we have something not from Cats.
First- grader Gertrude Trinke and her father, Oliver...
Psst!
- Just my grandfather.
I' m sorry.
First- grader Gertrude Trinke and her grandfather will be performing what I can only assume is a hymn, entitled "God, That' s Good", from the musical Sweeney Todd.

- You were great.
You... guys...

Oh, God!
Bye, Uncle Block.
- I' m startin 'to like show business.
Well, don' t get caught up in the glory.
Tomorrow you' re on shithouse duty.
I' m so tired of being your little geisha.
You had me worried there for a minute.
Yeah, who knew all those years you were nursing a case of stage fright.
Not about that, smart ass.
About the other thing.
- About moving away.
- Come on, Dad.
Not as much as I don' t wanna die alone.
(_ "Let My Love Open The Door" by Pete Townshend)
You wanna go over there and cheer up your pop?
He' s devastated about missing his big singing debut.
Aw!
Hey, Princess!
Look at you.
Yeah, well, it might take me longer than some, but I, uh...
- May l?
- Uh...
I like to think I come around eventually.
Well, you showing up when you did like that?
That was just about the most romantic thing I' ve ever seen.
Honestly.
Well... stick around.
It may get even more romantic than that.
- Really?
See?
I' il think about it.
Do that.
Ollie Trinke...
Uh...
The sun even shines on a dog' s ass some days.
You getting a dog?
Maya?
- Can I dance with my dad now?
Don' t let him go, though, Gert.
I know.
Come here.
- You wanna dance?
- No.
No city.
God help us, yes, we' re staying with Pop.
- And you' re taking me to see Cats?
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Anything for you, Gert.
- You know why?
'Cause you' re the only thing I was ever really good at.
{y: i} There are an estimated 8 million people {y: i} in the five boroughs of New York.

{y: i} This is the telephone booth {y: i} at 53rd and 8th... {y: i}... perhaps the last vestige of privacy {y: i} on Manhattan 's West Side.
{y: i} It is the last booth of its type, {y: i} still in regular operation.
{y: i} Up to 300 calls daily originate here.
{y: i} This location has been burglarized {y: i} 41 times in the last six months.
{y: i} Verizon has scheduled this structure {y: i} to be torn down... {y: i}... and replaced with a kiosk {y: i} as of 8 a. m. tomorrow.

Donny, listen to me.
I said I' d get you magazine coverage, and I' m getting you in a magazine.
No means yes to these people.
Get "What' s Up?" magazine on the line.
Yeah, I heard you.
Donny, I got "What' s Up?" magazine on the line.
They wanna know about you, so I' m hanging up.
I can' t tell the difference.
- We said no.
I didn' t hear you, so I' m giving you a second chance.
- Magicians?
Donny G is an artist who happens to look like a supermodel. "- The New Guys" is offering him the cover. "- New Guys" wants him?

Seriously, we gotta look at a new night for your release party.
All the happening places are booked.
If we move the date...
Voodoo on you- do, motherfucker, from Big Q to Big Stu!

Next time I' m gonna kill your cracker- ass if you keep talking about me like that!

You put the "Ho" in show business, Stuey.

They just checked Mrs. Sharp into Bellevue again.

Enjoy the show.

Bless you.
- It' s me.
I' m looking for some mutual back- scratching.
You get my privileged N. Y. P. D. Blue info and I get you to save my ass.
I' m a sick woman.
This is going to make you feel better.
Tony- winning producer Jeffrey Sharp tossed his wife back into drug rehab.
What do you want for that little tidbit?
You better be nice to me while I' m on the way up and taking your calls.
The higher the monkey climbs, the more you see of his ass.
Have a heart, Lana.
Listen, today my half- wit assistant faxed you regarding my favorite client.
Great singer, about to turn great actress.
- Look, I' m on cell, no names.
You didn' t print it, did you?
- All right, tell me Richard didn' t see it.
He didn' t put it in the column?
Stu' s on the phone, scared he' s gonna lose his job.
He wants it.
You tell him T. F. B. Put that at the top of the column.
- Yeah?
- I' m really sorry.
Yes!
"What' s Up?" magazine offered Donny G a photo in "What' s Hot and Happening."
- He' s on a conference call.
Okay.
- Thank you.
If you can absorb everything I teach you...... focus and get a new wardrobe, you can make it big in public relations.
Cool.
- How you doing, man?
Mario' s!
Hey!
How come you run every time you go past my place, huh?
- Yeah?
Well, no more drinks or free meals, okay?
No!
Mario, maybe I could throw the hippest party this month your way.
My clients would kill me.
- It' s just Big Q, the hottest new rap star.
- Nine and 11.
MTV, BET, VH1.
But I promised other clients, people who actually pay me.
- It' s gotta be the night of the 18th.
Toss in a buffet for 80 people, record company will pick up the booze...... and I will deliver you celebrities.
Anything you want, okay?
Expand the menu, wallpaper those bathrooms, for God' s sake.
You only get one shot with celebrities.
Thank you, Stu!
Call Big Q. Tell him we got him the hippest place in town on his date.
- Yeah.
We' il take their offer.
Messenger a bottle of Jameson' s to Lana at Page Six...... with a note saying...
- "Irish chicken soup.
- Yeah.
Actually, better off, deliver it over yourself.
- I' il do that.
Thank you for teaching me.
- Actually, no.
Get yourself one.
- Yeah, I hope so.
Hold them.
- All right.
- See you, Adam!
- I' m trying to make a call here.
Half- pepperoni, half- mushroom, extra crisp.
You ever heard of delivering a pizza to a phone booth?
I don' t think so.
Gentleman occupying phone booth, 53rd, between Broadway and 8th.
It' s a mistake.
It' s all paid for.
There' s a homeless guy around the block.
Give him the pizza and say "You can turn away, but you can' t make it go away."
They always get that idea.
Get off the fucking pizza, all right?
That language is uncalled for.
Holy shit!
Please return to sender.
Fuck off.
You look like you could use a good meal.
Hello.
Pam, could you believe some nut case just tried to deliver me a pizza?
Why are you always in the same phone booth, same time, every day?
- Thank God, we were mobbed today.
So how' s your day?
It' s getting better by the minute, sweetheart.
Who' s the most famous person you publicized today?
- Really?
I told a few columnists Mel Gibson was looking for actresses for his film.
And I said the possibilities were Cameron Diaz, Julia Roberts...... and my favorite client, you.
You didn' t really do that.
First step toward being noticed is being mentioned.
I just got out of a conference at the City Hotel.
I was thinking you could come down.
There are a couple of people and a few martinis I' d like to introduce you to.
Pam.
Come on.
I feel awful but I promised my scene partner that I would rehearse for class.
I' m playing Ren√©e Zellweger' s part.
That' s great.
Look, I rescheduled a meeting to see you...... but I guess I can reschedule it back.
I' m not mad.
Maybe tomorrow.
Yeah, later.
- What?
Big kiss.
You too.
{y: i} - Isn' t it funny?
{y: i} You hear a phone ring, {y: i} and it could be anybody... {y: i}... but a ringing phone has to be {y: i} answered, doesn' t it?
What?
{y: i} I hope you realize {y: i} how you' ve hurt my feelings.
{y: i} - Don' t think about leaving that phone.
{y: i} - It was a perfectly delicious pizza.
{y: i} You' re certainly going {y: i} to wish you had accepted it.
That was funny shit.
{y: i} Well, its purpose was to keep {y: i} your strength up for what' s coming next.
{y: i} - Oh, no, you won' t.
- Obey you?
{y: i} - Someone who enjoys watching you.
Watching me?
Very Italian.
Where are you?
{y: i} Why don' t you check them out?
{y: i} - You' re scratching your head.
{y: i} Now you' re brushing your hair back.
{y: i} That' s not very nice, Stu.
Did you call me Stu?
{y: i} - Why, do you prefer Stuart?
A lot of people in this neighborhood know me.
{y: i} Stuart Shepard, 1326 West {y: i} 51st Street, Third Floor, front.
{y: i} - I know Pamela McFadden too.
{y: i} It' s not in your best interest {y: i} to disconnect me.
{y: i} Someone could get hurt.
{y: i} What' s the matter, Stu?
If you' re some fucked- up, failed actor I wouldn' t handle...... or some prick intern I fired, I will hunt you down and I will crush you.
You will never work in this town.
I can turn people into gods...... and I can turn you into a total fucking loser if you weren' t one already.
Hello.
Pay you off or something?
{y: i} - Now you want to talk to me.
Did Adam at my office put you up to this?
{y: i} No, I thought this up all by myself.
I' m hanging up.
{y: i} Talk to you later.
What the...?
{y: i} The callback feature {y: i} cannot be activated...
Motherfucker.
{y: i} - I want your complete attention.
One of your pathetic failed ones.
{y: i} - Tell me about it.
{y: i} I can' t get work in this town as it is.
{y: i} I' ve done some off- Broadway, some {y: i} off- Manhattan plays, but that dried up.
{y: i} Now I wait tables, clean toilets, {y: i} anything to make the rent.
{y: i} I' m a walking clich√©.
I can get you auditions.
{y: i} You' re a publicist.
I can get you an audition.
- Yeah.
{y: i} Well, there is someone {y: i} I' d like you to call.
Name it.
{y: i} Try the number you dialed {y: i} when you first got into the booth.
{y: i} - No?
{y: i} Lucky you then, {y: i} because I wrote it down.
{y: i} Let' s see if Pam is still at work.
{y: i} - Then I guess I' il have to do it.
It' s already ringing.
- You' re fucking kidding me.
{y: i} Stu, I never kid.
{y: i} - Well, hello, Pam.
{y: i} - It' s a good friend of Stu' s.
- You know Stu?
{y: i} I know he lies.
{y: i} - Don' t worry about that.
He can hear {y: i} what we' re saying about him.
- Pam, hang up the goddamn phone!
{y: i} She can' t hear you, Stu.
{y: i} Pam, I' m afraid Stu hasn' t been {y: i} totally honest with you.
- Don' t do this.
- Pam, hang up.
{y: i} Now, why would a man {y: i} who has a cell phone... {y: i}... call you every day {y: i} from a phone booth?
{y: i} - Pam, that' s just stupid.
{y: i} It' s because his wife checks {y: i} his cell phone bills.
- Jesus Christ.
{y: i} - Oh, he' s married.
I' ve never seen her {y: i} but she sounds lovely.
{y: i} Why do you think {y: i} he invites you to the City Hotel?
- Asshole.
{y: i} He' s telling you all this {y: i} so you' il sleep with him.
- I know that, okay?
I may be from Montana, but we have men there also.
I wasn' t planning on sleeping with him.
I just don' t know a lot of people here right now.
And he' s cute and he said that he would help me.
Bye.
Hello?
{y: i} Back to you, Stu.
Gotta hit this trick before the next bitch takes my score.
Hang up the phone, nigga.
Bitch.
Did I...?
- She' s not home.
{y: i} Oh, but I' m sure {y: i} she' s at the shop on Columbus.
How the fuck do you know all this shit?
Press "auto one." {y: i} That' s her button.
{y: i} - Why don' t you try the truth?
I never have.
{y: i} - Then what do you call it?
- Look, you' re a guy...... sometimes you want to know it' s a possibility.
It' s like having a beautiful home...... but you still dream of that quick vacation.
You know, some nice hotel room with a great view, maybe a pool.
You never leave home.
{y: i} - Kelly is a home and Pam is a motel.
- Fuck you.
{y: i} Hey, that kind of language {y: i} is uncalled for.
This here' s my business.
This is not the only phone in New York.
It' s the only one on 8th Avenue that' s working.
- Motherfucker, this is my phone.
You done made me hurt my dick hand.
Yeah, go away.
Get out of my way!
I thought she was {y: i} gonna put an eye out with that hand.
Whoever you are, you' re obviously a very intelligent man.
It' s all I can do from going crazy myself.
- No, you' re going through a difficult time.
Look, please don' t call my wife.
We' il talk.
I know a reasonable photographer who will do some headshots.
{y: i} Stu, do you really think {y: i} that I' m an actor?
None.
{y: i} I would just like you to tell Kelly {y: i} the truth about yourself.
{y: i} So are you going to call Kelly {y: i} and tell her about Pam?
- No!
I' m doing it.
{y: i} Feeling kind of nervous, Stu?
{y: i} - Hold it to the receiver so I can hear.
- Yeah.
- I' m in a phone booth.
Baby, I just got this call from this guy who said you' d be calling me...... from a booth to tell me something important.
There' s a lot of prank calling going on today, baby.
- Shut up.
{y: i}... to have drinks at discreet hotels.
I' m not talking to you, baby.
{y: i} Someone' s got company.
- Bitch got a cell phone!
- He just called me a hooker.
Escorts.
{y: i} Tell her you want to sleep {y: i} with other women.
There is this person and he' s saying things about me.
Things that might not be true.
Get the fuck out of here before I call the cops!
{y: i} Honey, I want {y: i} to sleep with other women.
Look, Kelly, whatever he says, don' t believe him.
{y: i} - Only because Pam had to rehearse.
Shut the fuck up!
Stu, I don' t know what you' re talking about, but you' re scaring me.
I' m sorry, baby.
Can you just come over to the store so we can talk in person?
Look, I' il try.
- Yeah, bitch!
{y: i} - "I love you."
Get out of here before I have you deported to Jersey.
- And you' re a dirty skank.
- Your mama is a skank, bitch!
{y: i} You didn' t tell your wife {y: i} the truth, did you, Stu?
{y: i} And you can tell she really loves you.
{y: i} Must be nice to have {y: i} a pretty girl care for you.
She never did you harm.
{y: i} Everybody does harm.
This mind- fuck is over.
{y: i} Stu, if you hang up, I will kill you.
What are you going to do about it with your goddamn binoculars?
{y: i} I never said I had binoculars.
{y: i} I have a highly magnified {y: i} telescopic image of you.
{y: i} Now what kind of device {y: i} has a telescopic sight mounted on it?
You mean like a rifle?
{y: i} A. 30- caliber bolt- action 700 {y: i} with a carbon- one modification... {y: i}... and a state- of- the- art {y: i} Hensholdt tactical scope.
- Yeah, how' s my fucking hair?
{y: i} At this range, the exit wound ought to be {y: i} about the size of a small tangerine.
Go to hell.
{y: i} Now, doesn' t that just {y: i} torque your jaws?
{y: i} I love that.
{y: i} You know, like in the movies {y: i} just as the good guy... {y: i}... is about to kill {y: i} the bad guy, he cocks his gun.
{y: i} Now why didn' t he have it cocked?
{y: i} Because that sound is scary.
{y: i} It' s cool, isn' t it?
Look, you shoot a gun here and there' il be pandemonium.
There will be cops all over this block.
One.
{y: i} That won' t help you.
{y: i} Three.
{y: i} Look at all of the people screaming, Stu.
{y: i} Here come the cops.
{y: i} Gunfire, hit the deck.
{y: i} Stu, you still with me?
{y: i} Stand up and be a man.
So do you mean you would whack me for no particular reason?
{y: i} No, I have plenty of reasons, {y: i} and you keep giving me more.
No.
{y: i} It would be so easy.
{y: i} Stu, you just gave that gentleman {y: i} $10 to walk away.
{y: i} You do have a sensitive side.
{y: i} - Let' s see how sensitive you really are.
{y: i} I' m aiming at you right now.
{y: i} Can you feel it, the heat of it?
{y: i} Come now, Stu, you can feel it.
{y: i} Concentrate.
{y: i} Concentrate.
{y: i} Take a look at where I' m going.
{y: i} You' re doing so much better {y: i} than the others.
{y: i} You read about the German porn king {y: i} shot 10 days ago... {y: i}... at 38th and 8th?
{y: i} He thought he was an artist and wouldn' t {y: i} admit he was just a pedophile.
{y: i} Believe me, he had plenty {y: i} of chances to come clean.
{y: i} You must have read about the corporate {y: i} executive shot at 47th and 10th.
{y: i} What you didn' t read {y: i} was that he cashed in all of his stocks... {y: i}... just before the bottom fell out, {y: i} while all the little guys lost everything.
{y: i} Now if he had been willing {y: i} to make amends... {y: i}... share the money, {y: i} things might have been different.
{y: i} Please, tell me, {y: i} where am I aiming now?
{y: i} - Which one?
The right shoulder.
{y: i} - That' s phenomenal, Stu.
{y: i} You' re doing so much better {y: i} than the others.
{y: i} What do you remember {y: i} about those killings, Stu?
I don' t know.
Try.
{y: i} - Okay, I' il give you a hint.
{y: i} Wallets, watches, everything {y: i} was left on their bodies.
They were executions.
{y: i} They didn' t have to be.
Why me?
{y: i} If you have to ask, {y: i} then you' re not ready to know yet.
Come on.
- Now what?
You got any idea how much pain you' re making in my life?
- Look, I hear you!
Hang up the phone and walk away.
- I got my own problems.
You know why?
My girls keep yapping at me, "Leon, he won' t share the phone."
"Leon, he told us to fuck off."
"We' re gonna make you nuts unless you make him get off the fucking phone."
- I sympathize, but I can' t get off the call.
I got the G- string union here.
They' re breaking my balls.
I gotta live with their shit, but not yours.
Walk away.
- He got a cell phone up in there too.
- I can' t get off the call!
It' s like nails on a chalkboard.
They ain' t gonna fucking stop, till I get their way.
I' il pay you to go away.
It' s all yours.
{y: i} - Everybody has their price, right, Stu?
You' re gonna give me $120 to rent the booth the bums piss in?
- Something ain' t right with him.
Look at that sweat pouring off that son of a bitch.
- It' s probably catching too.
- He' s got AlDS.
- Indefinitely.
- Yes.
Let me tell you something. - $500 gets you indefinitely.
Hold the fuck up!
What, you got bitch in you now?
- Yeah, now talk to him like that!
Are you enjoying this?
- Look, I' m handling it.
{y: i} - I can help you, Stu.
I wasn' t gonna kill you before, but you changed my fucking mind.
He gonna kick your ass.
- Get the fuck out!
Will you go away?
I, look...
{y: i} - Get rid of him.
- We can work this out!
- Hang up the phone.
It' s a Solaris, $2000 retail.
I got a gold Rolex, motherfucker.
Five.
- Four.
{y: i} I can stop him.
Three.
One.
Don' t.
{y: i} This will count as a hang up.
Can you hear me?
{y: i} - What?
Yes!
Oh, my God.
You must' ve cut yourself...
- You cut yourself.
- Baby?
- Oh, my God!
- You shot him.
{y: i} - You said, "Yes."
"Yes, I can hear you," not, "Yes, kill him!" {y: i} You ought to be more careful {y: i} with what you say.
Oh, my God.
- It wasn' t me!
- Fuck you!
He' s got a Glock!
Daddy got a Glock!
It' s a telephone!
They gonna skin and fry your ass!
Mr. Motherfucker!
I' m not going anywhere, am I?
{y: i} If you had dealt with the man decently, {y: i} this might not have been necessary.
I offered him my watch.
{y: i} But not your respect, {y: i} which is what he really wanted.
{y: i} You were dismissive like you dismissed {y: i} the nice pizza guy.
{y: i} You are guilty of inhumanity {y: i} to your fellow man.
I' m not guilty of a goddamn thing.
Be a man.
You shoot the guy, and I' m fucking responsible?
{y: i} Well, looked that way from up here.
I don' t know what I did to you but whatever it was, I' m glad.
I wish you died!
- Just tell me who you are.
{y: i} I don' t run in your circles.
{y: i} - I watch.
- You watch?
{y: i} - Yes, well, what else is there to do... {y: i}... when life turns on you and you' ve {y: i} retreated into some small room?
{y: i} You look out your window.
The same ones every day.
{y: i} You imagine their stories.
{y: i} But eventually, you get tired {y: i} of imagining and follow one of them.
{y: i} And you hear all of his lies.
{y: i} And you decide that his sins {y: i} should be punished.
{y: i} Some guy shouting into a cell phone full {y: i} of self- importance isn' t gonna notice me.
{y: i} But I noticed that German porn king, {y: i} and I noticed that corrupt executive.
{y: i} And I noticed you, Stu.
What is your emergency?
Will you please respond?
What was so interesting about a guy in a phone booth on 53rd and 8th?
"Better than TV."
Look, how' d I get so lucky to be picked up by a killer with a rifle?!
{y: i} Kelly at home, Pam on the side.
Lovely.
{y: i} Life has given you {y: i} more than your fair share, Stu.
{y: i} But it appears you don' t appreciate it.
Look, look, listen, appearances can be deceiving.
I may look confident, but I' m really, actually just crying out for help!
You know?
{y: i} I' m trying to help you, Stu, {y: i} but you won' t help yourself.
{y: i} - What' s the matter, Stu?
{y: i} - It' s time you learn, Stu.
What fucking deception?
{y: i} "Are you in need of immediate police {y: i} or medical response?"
You bugged the fucking booth.
That' s how you knew about Pam.
- Look, I didn' t pick you.
It must have been your flashy suit that attracted me.
That why you killed Leon?
{y: i} I didn' t kill Leon because {y: i} of the way he dressed.
Did they dress too nice?
{y: i} You must feel really expensive {y: i} when you walk out the door.
All right, here come the cops.
Run?
{y: i} No, I' m not a coward {y: i} like some people I know.
{y: i} - You' il blame me for Leon.
No, no, I' il confess I shot him with my fucking phone.
{y: i} Well, then I urge you {y: i} to keep one thing in mind, Stu.
You saw how {y: i} accurate I can be, how lethal.
Kill me now, and you give yourself away.
{y: i} Not with a silencer.
{y: i} It would take these guys... {y: i}... the rest of the day to figure out it {y: i} wasn' t one of their own men that did it.
{y: i} You can be shot 41 times {y: i} for pulling out your wallet.
Throw down your weapon and come out with your hands raised.
- Yeah, what if they open fire?
Look around you, Stu.
{y: i} Do you see the tourists {y: i} with the video cameras?
{y: i} The ones hoping the cops {y: i} will blow you away... {y: i}... so they can sell the tape "to" The Most Gory Police Shootouts?
{y: i} Don' t worry, they' il keep {y: i} the police on their best behavior.
{y: i} So long as you don' t take {y: i} hostile action, you should be safe.
You call this safe?
I got a whole fucking precinct here with guns pointed my way.
With both hands raised, moving slowly, step out of the booth.
If we see any signs of a weapon we will respond.
You won' t because there isn' t any!
Put down the phone and raise your hands!
I' m on an important call.
Verify this information for me.
The guy in the booth shot that guy over there...... and stuck around to make a phone call.
Yeah, that' s what the hookers are saying.
All right, give me the horn.
- I' m busy, all right.
- Step out of the booth...... and raise your hands.
I am giving you an order.
{y: i} I give the orders here, Stu, don' t I?
This guy is looking for us to kill him, captain.
Well, that' s not gonna happen.
Get that body out of here fast.
Tell the ambulance to get the body.
{y: i} Thousands of people die every day, {y: i} but you put one dead body... {y: i}... in the middle of a busy street {y: i} and it makes people crazy.
{y: i} You can smell the fear.
{y: i} - This reminds me of Nam.
{y: i} - Yes, Vietnam.
I was too young to go, but I' ve seen pictures.
{y: i} You can' t imagine the fear, the stench.
{y: i} Napalm- charred bodies, children {y: i} leaving grenades in your boots.
{y: i} - I came home and people spit on me.
Yeah, this country owes you an apology.
Look, I just had this vision of you, of a kid, coming back from the war...... inured to the killing, not able to get work, isolated.
I think that could be made into an affecting story...... and, you know, one that everyone understands.
And I think cops are on the side of vets.
{y: i} Why don' t you wake up?
{y: i} I' d have to be 50 to be in that war!
Stop fucking with my head, please!
I' m gonna go talk to him.
Shouldn' t we wait on the ESU negotiator?
I' m not gonna take a chance on this one.
I' m gonna handle this.
I' m taking out my weapon.
Putting my weapon down on the car.
- I' m not armed.
- My name is Ramey.
- All right.
- I don' t want to be friends.
It looks like you could use a friend right now.
- I already got a friend.
Is that who you' re talking to on the phone?
That' s all.
I ain' t got no side of it, and I didn' t shoot anybody.
Look.
He been...
Sir, do you have the weapon in your pocket?
I got no fucking weapon.
Then what are you doing in a phone booth making calls?
- Hey!
Hold your fire!
I know what' s there.
I got plenty of witnesses over here who saw you use it.
They didn' t see it because it didn' t happen!
- He' s dead, but it didn' t happen?
{y: i} - Mustn' t tell him, Stu.
- You were the closest one to him.
- No.
- Look, stay the fuck out of this.
Who do you keep talking to on the phone?
- Your friend, your parent, your lover?
Careful.
My psychiatrist.
- I see.
It would be really helpful to us if we knew.
It' s privileged information.
{y: i} See, now you' re having fun.
- I respect your right to privacy.
The department provided it for me.
I know it' s not good form for a cop to be saying that, but sometimes...... you know, circumstances, stress...
{y: i} Tell him not to come any closer.
Go back a few steps.
No problem.
- So you got some intimacy issues.
All I want to know is, what happened, man?
- I want you to read me my rights.
Stop asking questions.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford one, an attorney will be provided for you.
So now, can you at least give me your first name?
{y: i} - Don' t tell him.
It' s my right not to have any first name.
- That' s right.
{y: i} - Demand your lawyer.
All right?
I want an attorney brought down here to negotiate my surrender.
{y: i} - Just brilliant, Stu.
- I understand that, but...... it' s gonna be difficult to get a lawyer to come and risk his life.
- How can I?
You won' t let me put my hand in my pocket?
We' il take it out for you.
Nothing will happen to you.
{y: i} - Stu, Stu.
{y: i} - Ask him a question.
{y: i} Ask him if his wife {y: i} got tired of sleeping with him.
I can' t do that.
{y: i} Ask him if he couldn' t get it up, {y: i} if he couldn' t satisfy her.
No.
{y: i} - Ask him.
{y: i} - Ask him!
- Sir?
Captain, you couldn' t satisfy your wife sexually?
{y: i} - Ask him if he abuses himself now?
For God' s sake!
{y: i} Say it!
{y: i} Say it or I will blow him away!
- Hey!
I' m gonna see about that lawyer for you, okay?
- Just relax.
- I wanna know who' s on that phone.
I need to talk to somebody about that phone.
{y: i} Should we give ourselves up?
{y: i} Maybe I' d like someone {y: i} to negotiate my surrender.
{y: i} - I won' t just spill my guts to anyone.
{y: i} I mean, you' ve got connections, right?
{y: i} - Could you get Larry King down here?
Why the fuck would Larry King come here?
{y: i} Who else could you get, huh?
Diane Sawyer?
{y: i} - I, I, I busy.
{y: i} Peter Jennings?
No!
{y: i} And you' ve got a credibility problem.
All right?
What about yours?
Your local news, Stuart.
{y: i} You couldn' t do this for your clients {y: i} if your life depended on it.
{y: i} But me, I' ve made you famous.
{y: i} Stick your head out so they can get {y: i} a better angle on you.
{y: i} - How ungrateful.
{y: i} Those cameras will make the police {y: i} very careful.
- Can you tap into that phone call?
- Should be no problem.
- Except...... we' il need a warrant if he' s on the line with his shrink.
I' m not gonna jeopardize this on a technicality.
Look, tracing, that' s not a violation, right?
- Okay, this is what I want you to do.
I want you to find who he' s talking to and their current location.
We get that?
I want somebody to find out what' s going on.
{y: i} Look across the street and see what {y: i} everybody in New York is looking at.
{y: i} You' re the center of attention.
{y: i} Wait till this goes national:
{y: i} ABC, CBS, CNN, UPN... {y: i} You' re gonna hit {y: i} the whole alphabet, Stu.
I' il be forgotten about in a week.
No one ever remembers the names of the victims.
Right?
Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy...... fucking Jeffrey Dahmer.
You can' t.
Anyway, I don' t deserve to be the center of attention.
- It ought to be you they' re covering. "- That attention would embarrass me".
{y: i} - How terror inspires your creativity?
Listen, this could be a media frenzy, all right?
You' d get Barbara Walters...... I mean, Larry King if you still wanted him.
{y: i} That approach seems predicated upon {y: i} me surrendering without killing you.
Listen, we can make you sympathetic, sit with a writer, bang out a book.
Get America on your side.
All right, you killed Leon because he was gonna kill me.
All right?
In a city where nobody looks out for anybody, you took a stand.
I' m your best witness.
{y: i} So you want me to trust you {y: i} to get me out of this?
Trust me.
{y: i} Stu, you must think I' m crazy.
- I' il take care of him.
Should' ve waited for me to initiate contact with the suspect.
Let you know if I need help.
Are you grandstanding for TV cameras?
Or do you want to leave this to a professional?
Until a professional gets here, I' il handle it.
All right, you get somebody else killed, it' s on your head.
Got it?
This is the City Hotel here.
And five sharpshooters up here.
See if you can get me two in the subway.
What the fuck?
I can' t reach for the phone.
{y: i} - I' il bet it' s Kelly.
{y: i} She' s sick with worry.
I' m not gonna make her feel any better, am I?
{y: i} Well, you could ask her {y: i} to forgive you, Stuart.
{y: i} You could confess your sins {y: i} and beg for absolution, come clean.
{y: i} You' re in this position {y: i} because you' re not telling the truth.
I' m in this position because you got a gun!
{y: i} Avoidance and deception.
Now, talk to her.
{y: i} - I am telling you to answer that phone!
- You can' t cross in front of here!
{y: i} Answer it!
{y: i} - Don' t make me hurt you!
- It' s not her calling.
It' s you, you miserable fuck!
{y: i} You continue to impress.
You could shoot me, but you want them to do it!
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Here' s her ID.
- Who do you think he' s talking to?
I spoke to him earlier today and I told him...... that there was a man who called me.
- A man?
Did this upset him, that you were talking to other men?
It' s not like that.
- Who' s his psychiatrist?
- That you know of.
I' d know if he was in therapy.
I saw somebody after my divorce.
It kept me from picking up a gun, doing something I would regret.
- Look, Stu didn' t kill anyone.
- Ma' am, under the circumstances...... you need to consider whether your husband is who you thought he was.
'Cause according to these witnesses over here, he has a gun...... he has used that gun and let' s pray to God that he doesn' t use it again.
Captain?
If you can think of any dispute he' s having currently, please, tell me.
I can stage an assault unit within feet of the booth.
We' ve also got sharpshooters securing rooftop positions.
- Absolutely.
What about that wire tap?
You gotta hold tight a while, all right?
- Okay.
Mrs. Shepard.
Call him Stu.
Okay.
Come with me, please.
Stu.
I have your wife with me.
You deceived me.
- She' s not my wife.
Are you okay?
{y: i} - Yes, talk to her, Stu.
Look, she' s not my wife!
She' s stalking me!
You are his wife, right?
Yes, here' s a photograph of us together.
I don' t know what he' s talking about.
Listen to your wife.
- She' s not my wife!
Stu, nobody wants to hurt you.
- Yeah, very good.
Go home!
Just come out.
Just do what they tell you to do.
{y: i} Your wife is a crazy actress stalker {y: i} and you don' t know her.
- Get her out of here!
- You out of your fucking mind?
I don' t know what' s going on.
We' re fine.
Just stay here, okay?
- I think she did some good.
- No, we don' t have a lawyer.
He asked for his lawyer to come negotiate his surrender.
- Well, you need a good one now.
Okay?
I' m gonna get your husband out alive.
- Get Mrs. Shepard out of here.
You know, get her some coffee or something.
You need some kind of redemption.
- Get the fuck out of my face!
- I' m not stepping down!
You okay?
Yeah, I' m fine.
{y: i} You' d think she didn' t know {y: i} she was being watched.
{y: i} - But beautiful women always know.
{y: i} - That false indifference, superior air... {y: i}... it' s just a tease.
{y: i} They want eyes on them.
{y: i} Why does she put on her makeup, {y: i} do her hair, dress so nicely?
{y: i} Not for her husband {y: i} that she hardly ever sees.
{y: i} I notice.
Leave her alone.
{y: i} I' m giving her what she wants.
{y: i} I bet you' ve never looked at Kelly {y: i} the way I am right now.
{y: i} - Don' t I dare?
{y: i} I' m not the one {y: i} who has hurt her, Stuart.
Right?
{y: i} - The perfect violation.
- Leave her out of this.
{y: i} - How many times... {y: i}... have you had sex with Pam {y: i} in that hotel bedroom in your head?
{y: i} Would you really miss Kelly {y: i} if she was gone?
I' m not talking to you.
{y: i} Your choices put other people {y: i} in jeopardy.
{y: i} When are you gonna learn that?
Stuart, look uptown.
{y: i} These geniuses are still {y: i} at the juncture box trying to tap in.
{y: i} Only I have installed an encryption {y: i} device at both ends of the line.
{y: i} There' s no chance of a trap trace... {y: i}... so now they' ve gotta try some fancy {y: i} LoJack instrument.
{y: i} I hope you weren' t {y: i} pinning your hopes on those morons.
{y: i} Truth is, I' m on a wireless A. D. S. {y: i} With a cloned number.
{y: i} It' il take a half an hour to find out {y: i} I call forwarded through Philadelphia.
{y: i} And let me tell you, this will all be over {y: i} before they can get a dial tone.
It' s like a ball of rubber bands.
You keep working on it.
Stuart, come on, {y: i} you' re behaving like a child.
{y: i} Still gonna give me {y: i} the silent treatment?
{y: i} Come on.
{y: i} She used to dish this out.
{y: i} Stuart, please don' t do this.
{y: i} Stuart, you' re bringing back {y: i} my unhappy childhood.
{y: i} I can' t take it!
{y: i} I had a very happy childhood.
{y: i} Hey, there' s our girl again.
{y: i} I wasn' t planning on killing her... {y: i}... but plans change.
Just tell me what the fuck you want from me.
{y: i} I thought I was talking to myself again.
Just tell me.
{y: i} Tell Kelly about the real Stu, {y: i} about your little motel.
{y: i} - Why not?
{y: i} - That' s a start.
- Hold her back!
- Talk to me!
- Yes?
I' m listening.
Kelly, I called some woman.
- Every day.
And I called her and... {y: i} - I wanted to fuck her.
- And I wanted to sleep with her.
I wanted to fuck her.
- And I wanted to fuck her.
- Whatever you did, I don' t care.
Okay?
I' m sorry.
I' ve had enough of this.
{y: i} I haven' t.
{y: i} - I changed my mind.
You can' t do this to me.
I did everything you fucking asked.
I' m done with this.
Later.
- Maybe they already got a trace.
ESU, ESU?
- He' s coming out!
- I want to see you toss away your weapon!
Stay where you are!
Please, don' t hurt him!
- Stay right where you are!
Okay?
- Kelly, no!
Kelly!
Get back!
Okay!
I gotta answer it.
Don' t move.
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire.
- Please.
- What the fuck are you doing?
He' s coming out!
Answer the phone.
{y: i} - Hi, Stu.
{y: i} Now, you' ve had your little tantrum {y: i} and you said some things in anger... {y: i}... that I am willing to forget.
I want her in the car.
If he' s not the shooter, then who the fuck is?
Captain, what the fuck is up with the phone calls?
- You lied.
{y: i} You can' t know the pain of betrayal {y: i} until you' ve been betrayed.
I want you to talk to ESU.
I want you to get one of these guys, this building.
Okay?
All right?
Where' s the ESU sergeant?
You said we could go.
{y: i} - Relax, Stuart.
{y: i} Nobody gets it right the first time.
{y: i} You will get a chance to end this.
- Yeah, well, I am.
{y: i} - Besides the fear of death?
I' m gonna be dancing.
{y: i} - I could go for some target practice.
Second shot, you give yourself away.
{y: i} Go on, Stuart, hang up!
{y: i} Trust your fate to friendly men in flak {y: i} jackets with automatic weapons.
{y: i} I' m sure you can patch up that little {y: i} misunderstanding about the dead body.
{y: i} - You had motive.
{y: i} - Plenty of loudmouth witnesses.
No gun and I walk.
- Yes!
You murder a guy and you {y: i} forget where you stashed your gun?
{y: i} Why don' t you lift the {y: i} plastic ceiling panel and feel around?
{y: i} Peekaboo!
{y: i} Check it out, Stu.
Cops see me reach for something, they' il blow me away.
{y: i} There' s only one way to find out.
Look, the slugs in that dead guy, they came from your rifle.
I' ve seen enough cop shows.
There' s nothing to match.
{y: i} - Don' t take my word for it.
{y: i} There are rounds left in it.
Don' t disappoint me.
You' d shoot me {y: i} if you got the chance, wouldn' t you?
With a big fucking smile on my face.
{y: i} There' s the spirit.
{y: i} Now, what if I told you I was just {y: i} above the theater, four floors up?
{y: i} See the pink curtains?
Yes.
{y: i} Yoo- hoo!
{y: i} Yoo- hoo!
Why would you do that?
{y: i} The odds are even now, Stuart.
{y: i} Isn' t that what you wanted?
{y: i} You know where I am, {y: i} and you have a gun.
{y: i} If you have it in you, {y: i} you can take me down.
Fuck!
{y: i} - Oh, you' re probably right.
{y: i} I' m not really there anyway.
{y: i} You would' ve just spoiled {y: i} some nice lady' s curtains.
{y: i} Looks like someone watches the news.
{y: i} - The motel.
{y: i} - I think she could use a new headshot.
{y: i} - Then take down the gun.
{y: i} - She has everything to do with this.
{y: i} You' re here and she' s here {y: i} because you called her.
{y: i} Don' t make me hurt Pam, Stuart.
- Hey, everybody, get ready.
Let' s just see what he does, all right?
Let' s see what he' s doing.
There' s nothing there.
{y: i} Nothing but your fingerprints on the {y: i} finest cop killer money can buy.
- Fuck, no!
{y: i} Fine, then someone {y: i} will have to take your place.
{y: i} Come on, Stu, {y: i} you' re in a perfect position.
{y: i} - You get to choose between them.
{y: i} One of them can take your place.
Don' t do this!
I thought you only loved Kelly!
{y: i} - But you lie to her.
It' s complicated.
I say Pam.
This is all my fault!
She' s innocent!
Okay, Kelly, then.
- No, please!
{y: i} Don' t you get the game yet?
{y: i} Pick one and save yourself.
Time' s running out.
{y: i} Kelly or Pam?
Come on, Stu!
Stop this.
Get up!
Look... {y: i} - Get up, Stuart!
{y: i} You' re embarrassing yourself.
Listen.
The rifleman reports subject pulled a small, dark object out of his pocket.
You' re looking at a suicide on national fucking TV.
You gonna let me take this over?
Tell everybody to hold on, to hold their fire.
Stay ready, but hold.
- You can' t do this.
{y: i} No more spinning, no more excuses.
Listen, please listen to me.
{y: i} No more delays, Stuart.
I' m on my knees begging you not to kill me.
{y: i} I will if you keep up {y: i} this pathetic spectacle.
From up in your high window, you could kill anyone.
- All right, and...
You could pick off any of the cops, with your rifle.
{y: i} Shut up and stand up!
Look, why threaten Kelly?
You liked how she sounded on the phone at the store.
Don' t fucking hurt my wife.
You leave no choice.
- All right.
Tell me how this ends.
{y: i} The stage is almost set.
{y: i} People are gonna be eating dinner {y: i} watching you die.
We got a sniper situation here.
What about that phone call to your store?
I think it was a prank call.
He told me Stu would be calling me from a phone booth.
How long will it take to get a record of her calls?
If he' s using that secure line, we won' t know more than now.
Let' s assume he' s a human, makes mistakes like all of us.
I' ve been waiting for that number.
He sounded like mid- 30' s.
It would be safer if you got back in the car, okay?
- Thank you.
I want you to divert incoming ESU units to Broadway and hold them there.
- Yeah.
I don' t want the sniper to be aware of any of our movements.
He' s already got position on us.
Let' s not let him know we know too much, okay?
- Yeah.
Don' t look up.
Get me sharpshooters looking at those windows.
- I' m gonna buy us some time here.
All right.
It' s okay if I come out and talk to you for a second?
{y: i} - This guy is so lonely.
- You' re walking through a bad dream...... and you can' t wake up.
{y: i} - Now he' s really testing my patience.
You wanna wake up, Stu?
I wanna, but I got issues I can' t talk about.
I' m paying him overtime.
That was pretty brave what you did.
I mean, admitting all that stuff to your wife.
- Should' ve been.
Maybe if I could be more honest with my wife then...... I don' t know, something would' ve turned out different.
{y: i} Oh, please.
You trust me, Stu? "- Get this man a seat on" Oprah.
I wanna, but I got the issues I can' t talk about.
{y: i} Tell him to stay back.
Look, don' t come any closer.
Hey, I don' t wanna cause or make anything harder for you.
{y: i} Pam, Ramey, Kelly, people on the {y: i} street, you' ve got lives in your hands.
What the fuck do you want?
I wanna let you know that it' s safe outside the booth.
- It' s always, "Get out of the booth!"
It' s my world.
All right?
- Never.
- We' re not gonna force you out...... because there could be some miscalculation...... and then I would never find out why this happened.
Stu, I' m afraid.
I' m afraid that I' m gonna be standing by...... and my men are gonna shoot some guy...... and when we find out what' s in his hand, once we turn over his body...... and we see what he was threatening people with...
We realize that it was just a little black Bible.
{y: i} - Don' t push me, Stu.
I' m not gonna let that happen here.
I wanted to make a phone call.
One lousy call... {y: i} That' s enough, Stu.
- The worst.
I bet you want to jump off the edge.
{y: i} - I' m gonna push him over the edge.
{y: i} Just say the word.
It' s time to land.
- I' m your safety net.
{y: i} Oh, please, say the word.
If I tell you what you wanna know, you' il die too.
{y: i} Exactly.
- Good.
But, Stu, we put a call out to your lawyer.
Your wife, she gave us the number.
Okay?
The captain gets a bullet.
Hear what I said, asshole?
{y: i} - Enough of this sideshow, Stu.
- So this is all some religious thing?
Bible- crazed killer {y: i} picks on fashion- obsessed PR guy.
- Tell me what you want, then.
{y: i} - What everyone wants... {y: i}... for the bad guy {y: i} to get what he deserves.
{y: i} Go for the gun.
{y: i} - Yes.
It would be a rare, unselfish act.
- Nothing is hostile until I say it is.
Bam!
I got it.
- The cops' il kill me.
{y: i} You' re talking prime- time material now.
{y: i} - No.
{y: i} If you wanna save yourself, confess.
{y: i} - Everything?
No more excuses {y: i} and half- truths, Stuart.
{y: i} You look out into those cameras {y: i} and you bare your soul.
{y: i} TV seems to help bring out {y: i} the worst in people.
{y: i} You should be fine.
- No, not yet.
Okay?
{y: i} Stuart, I' m offering you a chance {y: i} to redeem yourself.
{y: i} Come on, humble yourself {y: i} in front of your loved ones... {y: i}... and millions of strangers and me.
{y: i} It' s do- or- die time.
What, you couldn' t find anyone worse than me?
Not a murderer or a child molester but a publicist...... who has fantasies about pretty little actresses.
Who spends money on Italian suits and dry cleaning...... so people think he' s important.
These are my crimes?
Tell them.
I' ve never done anything for anybody...... who couldn' t do something for me.
I string along...... a kid with promises that I' il pay him money.
I keep him around because he looks up to me.
You' re too good for it.
I lie to my friends.
I lie to newspapers and magazines who sell my lies to more and more people.
I should be fucking president.
I wear all this Italian shit because underneath, I still feel like the Bronx.
I think I need these clothes, and this watch.
My $2000 watch is a fake, and so am I.
I neglected the things I should' ve valued most.
I valued this shit.
Kelly, that' s Pam.
- Don' t blame her.
I never told her if I was married, and if I did...... she would' ve told me to go home.
Kelly, looking at you now, I' m ashamed of myself.
I mean, I work so hard on this image, on Stu Shepard, the asshole...... who refers to himself in third person, that I only proved I should be alone.
I' ve been dressing up as something I' m not for so long...... I' m so afraid you won' t like what' s underneath.
I' m just flesh and blood and weakness.
I love you so fucking much.
I take off this ring because it only reminds me of how I' ve failed you.
And, I don' t wanna give you up.
I wanna make things better, but it may not be my choice anymore.
You deserve better.
{y: i} - No.
I know a thing about lies.
I know a thing or two about liars as well.
{y: i} Then why the confession?
I didn' t do it for you.
- Yeah, got that.
The call to his wife originated at 2:
17...... at a hard line from the old Barkley Hotel.
- 604.
ESU units holding.
Bring them in from 52nd Street.
Cover the windows, doors, fire escape, every goddamn point of exit.
- Stu!
- Doors, fire escapes...
Now!
{y: i} At least you' il die {y: i} with a clean conscience.
Listen, you can hear them now.
Know why?
{y: i} - You can' t stop lying, can you?
They' re coming up the stairs.
Look around.
That room' s getting smaller every second.
You know what?
It' s not gonna be any bigger than this fucking goddamn booth!
- Get them to move!
- There' s nobody there?
They' re coming through that fucking door to put you out of your misery.
What' re you gonna do?
{y: i} If this is true, I have to take someone {y: i} with me, don' t I?
{y: i} Since Kelly is the most important thing {y: i} in your life, I' il take her.
This is about me!
Take me!
Come on!
It' s me you want!
Somebody talk to me.
{y: i} We' re too late.
{y: i} The psycho heard us coming... {y: i}... and slashed his throat {y: i} with a knife.
He' s lost a lot of blood.
I don' t want nobody dying on me.
All right.
- Your wife' s fine, all right?
All right, try not to sit up.
- Rubber bullet.
Figured if somebody' s gonna shoot you, it might as well be us.
Thanks.
- You did.
- Give yourself some credit.
Doesn' t always happen that way.
I' m okay.
I was so afraid.
I thought I wasn' t ever gonna see you again.
Me too.
We' ve got things to talk about.
I only want to talk about what you want to tell me.
Everything.
Get over here.
We lost him.
- I got him.
- I gotta see him.
- Yes, I do.
- Yes, I do.
- Go ahead.
You recognize him?
He was down here trying to deliver me a pizza...... 10 minutes before I got the call.
I told him to fuck off.
That' s enough these days.
Just give it a minute.
We' il be driving, and you' il be flying.
Whatever you say.
Nice shoes.
Italian.
You hung up, Stu.
I didn' t get a chance to say goodbye.
I feel bad about the pizza guy.
But I couldn' t miss seeing you and Kelly reunited.
Nobody ever does.
I just hope your newfound honesty lasts.
Because it if doesn' t, you' il be hearing from me.
{y: i} Isn' t it funny?
{y: i} You hear a phone ring, {y: i} and it could be anybody.
{y: i} But a ringing phone {y: i} has to be answered, doesn' t it?
{y: i} Doesn' t it?
Hello?
Come on, Arnie.
He' s changing his shirt.
Hey, Dennis.
- What?
- Last night, we' re playing Scrabble.
- Or what, Arnie? "tellatio" for 24 points and the game.
You know, Arnie, I was thinking -
No, seriously.
Now that we' re gonna be seniors, I figure it' s about time... that we got you laid.
- You know, like this year, huh?
- You need a girl to get laid.
Fuck you!
- So what?
I know.
I don' t have the minimum deposit to open an account.
Come on, Arnie.
- Hey, Terry.
Hi, Dennis.
I' m okay.
Doc says I' m as good as new.
Yeah.
I wouldn' t put that in my mouth.
- You don' t know where it' s been.
But we know where it hasn' t been.
- I' m in love, and I' m fussy.
Drop dead, Cunningham.
- What' s her name?
She looks smart, but she' s got a slut' s body.
Oh, shit.
Give me something for my lap.
We have a good band.
Went to the Rose Parade.
Won a prize last year.
I want to have deep, meaningful sex with her.
- Think I should?
You' ve got nothing to lose but your virginity.
Dennis, can you give me a hand?
Hey, Charley.
- What' s the matter?
- Hi, Dennis -
You want it?
If it' s yours, why isn' t your name on here anywhere?
"Arnie Cuntingham."
Why doesn' t it say Cuntingham?
Come on.
You want to go for it?
- You want to make me?
You' ve got a knife and he doesn' t.
- Yeah.
Get him, man!
All right, break it up!
You kids take a walk.
- I ain' t been doing nothing.
Yeah, I' m okay.
I don' t have to listen to garbage like that, Buddy!
He' s lying.
I swear to God.
You can' t make me.
Fuck!
Don' t go anywhere.
Now... if you don' t empty your pockets right now, I' m gonna call the cops.
I' il fix you!
So, all in all, it wasn' t a bad first day.
He' il tind somebody else to pick on.
They kick Moochie out?
Stop the car!
Go back!
- Just go back.
All right?
Jesus Christ.
Jesus.
Be careful, Dennis.
- I bet it won' t even start.
How much do you want for her?
- Jesus, Arnie.
Sonny, you ever owned a car before?
Name' s George LeBay.
What are you asking?
Start her up.
Her name' s Christine.
Come on.
My asshole brother bought her in September, '57.
You got your new model year in September.
Brand- new, she was.
She had the smell of a brand- new car.
When he got her, she had six miles on the odometer.
Died six weeks ago.
I' ve been asking 300.
I' il make it 250 tor you.
'cause I' m selling this shit hole and buying me a condo.
Will you stop and think about this tor a moment?
- Where are you getting the money?
- You already have a car.
Christine is decent.
- So that was 300?
- 250 would do it.
Do you realize she' s 20 years old?
Great.
I' m buying her.
I don' t care what you say.
It' s your funeral, man.
He doesn' t know what he' s doing.
- You' re kidding, right?
You can' t buy a car.
- You' re 17 years old.
I couldn' t finance it, but buying it for cash is no problem.
Registering a car at 17 is something else... and for that I need your permission.
You know how we do things.
I' ve consulted with you about every damn thing I' ve ever done.
How could you have let him do this?
You wanted me in college courses.
I' m there too.
I' ve managed 17 years without embarrassing you or landing in jail.
Fine!
- Could you honk your horn for me?
I tried to talk him out of it.
I knew a guy who had a car like that once.
You go out in the junkyard.
- Don' t interrupt me, punk.
Don' t interrupt me.
Don' t get smart.
- What?
You trying to help your buddy right out of here, Chuck?
I know a creep when I see one.
I think I' m looking at one right now.
You screw around with me...
I don' t care how much money you paid up in front...
You got it?
Good.
We' re closed.
Yeah.
You know, you better find yourself some other charity besides me and Christine.
Maybe it' s just that for the first time I' ve found something uglier than me.
You don' t just up and drive off whenever you -
Good hands.
You know, Papa, you can' t polish a turd.
Don' t think you got the gold key to the crapper.
Look.
Maybe we could work out some kind of a deal.
Do a few lubes... put the toilet paper on the little spools... shit like that.
Do that and you can - you can raid my junk pile for whatever you want.
I' il have to think about it.
I' il throw you out on your fuckin 'ass.
Always and forever
I' il love just you
I' il bet you a dollar she says no.
She says no to everybody.
I wish I was an eraser.
Come on.
- It' s pretty boring, huh?
Yes.
Are you lost?
No, ma' am.
Mister, this is not a hotel you can just drop into.
- What do you need?
- I need to leave.
- You come back here this instant.
Hey, man, no glasses.
I can' t make it.
No.
- Did you have plans with Dennis?
I don' t know.
Ever since he bought that car he' s been obsessed with it.
When we signed the registration papers at Town Hall... they told us the man who owned that car last... died in it of carbon monoxide poisoning.
Does Arnie know about that?
Arnie doesn' t know anything anymore.
What the hell do you want?
I know he died choking on exhaust fumes.
My brother died 'cause he wanted to.
Arnie wouldn' t have bought it if he' d known somebody died in it.
Either you' re dumb or you don' t know your friend very well.
He had the same look my brother always had.
Probably the only thing my brother ever loved in his life was that car.
No shitter ever came between him and Christine.
If they did, watch out.
His five- year- old daughter choked to death in it.
- Who' s Rita?
Then I made him get rid of it.
Of course, the car came back three weeks later.
Keep a- knockin ', but you can' t come in
Come back tomorrow night and try it again
You said you loved me and you can' t come in
Fifty.
Want me to go deep or flat?
Fucking shit!
This is the third time I' ve come by.
You' re always asleep.
That makes you a hero, right?
Did I tell you that I' m not gonna be playing football again?
Ever.
Shitters did some job on you, huh?
So what' s this about you and Leigh Cabot?
- We like each other okay.
Listen to Mr. Cool.
Well, it' s not what you think.
I really... respect her mind.
How' d you ever get that car tixed up like that?
I still can' t keep her at home.
I' m surprised they let you register it.
Are you serious?
They just don' t want me to grow up because they' d have to face getting old.
Has it ever occurred to you... that part of being a parent... is trying to kill your kids?
See you around, pal.
I can' t.
Here.
'Cause I hate that car.
I thought girls are supposed to be jealous of other girls, not cars.
Oh, please.
You gonna be all right?
Yeah, I' m fine now.
It happened, Arnie.
You didn' t want that man to help me either!
I thought he was attacking you!
That radio.
Know what I think?
I' il just be a second.
I just have to get my wallet out of Christine.
Please.
You know, I' ve been thinking.
Maybe we should apply to the same colleges next year.
If we get accepted by the same schools... we could take it as a sign of fate.
Who did this?
Sorry?
It' s your fault.
Iike rational human beings?
Your mother and I have decided to help you buy a new car.
Well, that' s what everybody wants, isn' t it?
I' m fixing up Christine.
You apologize to your mother right now!
Come on, come to me
Oh, shit.
Yeah.
Oh, cherry.
I spent a shitload ot money on her, and she' s perfecto now.
After I cleaned up the broken glass, it wasn' t so bad.
So what if you fix it up and he just comes back and does it again?
What does that mean?
I hope you didn' t think I could hang around here all day.
Stay loose.
Lean machine.
They let you out early?
I' m Rudolph Junkins, State Police, Detective.
I want to ask you about your car.
- Why, hell, everybody.
Local police, your mom and dad, your girl.
It' s right over there... and back here.
I replaced the entire door on this side.
- Yeah?
Nope.
So what do you want?
- Where?
- Tossed it out.
No, thanks.
That' s not what Leigh said.
Shit wipes off.
- You don' t know?
I' m not a Scout.
Don' t you?
Just be straight with me.
You' ve had it, right?
All I want is for you to make love to me
Watch this.
He' s backing up too.
Listen.
Listen.
Yes.
I' m gonna get ya.
Come on out.
She' s as skinny as a stick of macaroni
What?
I love her and she loves me
Makin 'love underneath the apple tree
Well, I told her mama and her papa too
- You tell me.
- Home.
- What are you doing to my car?
- You didn' t go out at all?
- You want the receipt?
Why didn' t you unload the stuff last night?
Somebody saw your car cruising behind Buddy Repperton last night.
He' s dead too.
So are Don Vandenberg and Richard Trelawney.
I got a Cadillac full of parts... and I' m supposed to be at school in half an hour.
I thought you wanted to talk about Christine.
Yeah?
I don' t think he' s Arnie.
We do it every year.
Maybe if I get him alone, maybe he' il talk to me.
What if that car doesn' t let him?
Come on, come on
Well, now, swing me, swing me all the way down there
My man, you really operate on those babies.
Is she?
Death... to the shitters ot the world in 1979.
I can' t drink to that.
You know, to friendship?
Oh, friendship.
This is great alignment.
It' s this fucking car.
We' il always be triends, as long as you stick with me.
You know what happens to shitters who don' t.
Let' s not kid each other.
All of 'em.
She does.
I thought you liked beer.
It kills me, how much it eats.
Feed it right, and it can be a beautiful thing... and that' s what we have.
No shitter ever came between me and Christine.
Chicken shit!
Yeah.
You better get in the office and stay out of sight.
What if he doesn' t come?
You better get in the office.
Keep your head down.
When you hear me start this thing up, that' s when you hit the button.
Rock and roll will always be
It' il go down in history
I wouldn' t feel so bad, if I were you.
You two are heroes, you know.
Yeah.
God, I hate rock and roll
