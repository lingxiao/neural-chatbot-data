You made a mistake back on that island, Bond.
You took something that didn' t belong to you, from a friend of Mr Big' s.
That type of mistake is tough to bounce back from.
- But I' ve only just arrived.
- Today is your lucky day, Jim!
You' re going skydiving!
There' s a helluva view of the lake from 10, 000 feet.
My only regret is I won' t be there to see it.
Let' s go!
You' re...
- Mrs Bell.
Where' s Mr Bleeker?
Indisposed.
I' il be giving the lesson.
What' s on for today?
Let' s just wing it, shall we, Mrs Bell?
You' re over- revving.
- Leroy, slow down, for Pete' s sake!
- Do what the man say!
I can' t find the brake!
Close those doors!
Holy shit!
Don' t worry, I' il take care of it.
Right.
Talk to you later.
I' ve got to go and give a lesson.
Same time tomorrow, Mrs Bell?
Yes, Mr Bleeker.
Yes, sir.
I know you just can' t glue the wings back on.
Now, Mr Bleeker, I' m sure there' s no reason for name- calling.
That' s fine.
Don' t forget the double vents.
I appreciate she' s one of your best pupils.
I' il keep the other three.
Any such suggestion should be put in writing to Washington.
- How is Mrs Bell?
- Intensive care, but she' il pull through.
Yes, sir.
No one' s questioning your patriotism.
I' m sure you' re a veteran, sir.
Felix, find out if there' s a Fillet Of Soul restaurant in town.
It' s on Docker Street.
Strutter' s watching it now.
Hell of a send- off.
This way.
- Where' s Strutter?
- He' s gotta be inside somewhere.
Two, gentlemen?
I got a nice booth over here, just against the wall.
Do you think you could find something a little closer to the stage?
- What' s wrong with a booth?
- I once had a nasty turn in a booth.
- Bourbon.
No ice, please.
- Two Sazeracs.
Where' s your sense of adventure?
This is New Orleans.
Relax!
- Yeah, right here.
- Call for you.
- Thanks.
For a minute, I thought Harry was laying down on a job.
What happened to my...
- What happened?
Listen.
Thanks for droppin 'in, baby.
Yeah, you' re one tough pig to nail down.
You' ve been picking at me like some kind of maggot.
First, you go up to Harlem and kill one of the brothers.
And that disturbed me.
And then you go and steal this valuable young lady from my good friend, Dr Kananga.
Now, old Kananga, he believes in all that card crap.
I mean, he' s mad.
I would say Kananga is your problem now.
Thank you.
In fact, if I were you, I' d... watch my step from now on.
Yeah, well, you just let me handle our business with the man.
I got my own plans for you, baby.
But first there' s one little question that he wants answers for.
Then you' d better ship me back to the island and let him ask in person.
I' m not in the habit of giving answers to lackeys.
You damn lucky you got an ear left to hear the question with.
Which is... did you mess with that?
That' s between Solitaire and myself... and Kananga.
I' il tell him when I see him.
You won' t see sunlight unless you answer!
I' d no idea you were so frightened of him.
Did you touch her?!
When I see Kananga.
Right.
Quite revealing.
Kananga: poppy grower in thousands of acres of well- camouflaged fields, protected by the voodoo threat of Baron Samedi.
Then there' s Mr Big, distributor and wholesaler through a chain of Fillet Of Soul restaurants.
Wholesale?
Sell heroin, for money?!
My apologies.
I' m sure you simply give it away.
Excellent, Mr Bond.
That' s precisely what I intend to do.
Two tons of it, to be exact.
When entering into a fiercely competitive field, one finds it advisable to give away free samples.
Man or woman, black or white.
I don' t discriminate.
Two tons of heroin with a street value well over a billion dollars nationally distributed free?
That should make a certain group of families rather angry, wouldn' t you say?
Angry?
Why, my dear Mr Bond, it' il positively drive them out of their minds.
- And subsequently out of the business.
- Quite ingenious.
A sort of junkies' welfare system.
Merely until the number of addicts in the country has doubled, shall we say?
Then I will market that acreage you blundered into the other day.
That heroin will be very expensive indeed, leaving myself and the phone company the only two going monopolies in this nation for years to come.
And here I thought it was Solitaire who did the fortune- telling.
Let' s hope for both your sakes she still can.
The question still stands, Mr Bond.
Asked by the gentleman concerned.
Did you touch her?
Well, it' s not the sort of question... a gentleman answers.
Well, having set the example, I don' t expect Miss Solitaire to be any less the lady.
By the way, that' s a particularly handsome watch you' re wearing, Mr Bond.
- May I see it, please?
- You' il forgive me if I don' t get up.
Butterhook!
Tee Hee.
On the first wrong answer from Miss Solitaire, you will snip the little finger of Mr Bond' s right hand.
Starting with the second wrong answer, you will proceed to the more... vital areas.
I want you to listen to me very carefully.
On the back of Mr Bond' s watch the registration number:
3- 2- 6 -
Do I speak the truth?
You speak the truth.
Well,... if nothing else, at least I' ve laid your fears to rest.
My compliments on a splendid operation.
There is one thing, however, the...
Whisper.
Take him to the farm.
When do we start back?
Soon, Solitaire.
Soon.
Solitaire, why?
I treated you well.
You lacked for nothing.
I don' t understand what you...
Mr Bond' s watch, my dear.
I gave you every break possible.
You had a 50- 50 chance.
You weren' t even close.
I had no choice.
The cards!
When the time came, I myself would have given you love.
You knew that.
You knew that!
There' s only one proper way to deal with this.
And one proper time.
The tonnage order is nearly complete.
We move it out tonight.
And I mean tonight!
Mr Bond.
How much do you know about crocodiles, Bond?
I' ve... always tried to keep them at arm' s length myself.
Cute little nippers, ain' t they?
I don' t suppose those potential overnight bags are orphans.
Oh, no!
We have some moms and dads as well.
In fact, quite a few thousand.
This is the part I like best: feeding time.
I suspect, the highlight of the tour.
Some of these babies live to be 200 years old.
Look over there.
You can always tell by its round nose.
There' s old Albert.
He' s a croc.
Got careless with him some time back, and he took my whole arm off.
Well done, Albert!
They' il eat anything.
Even each other.
Then again, sometime they can go a whole year without eating.
I was rather counting on that.
There are two ways to disable a crocodile, you know.
I... don' t suppose you' d care to share that information with me?
One way is to jam a pencil into the depression hole behind his eyes.
And the other?
The other' s twice as simple.
You just put your hand in his mouth and pull his teeth out.
Fire!
Evans, get him!
Adam, in the car!
Head him off!
Hector, move, damn it!
Bond ripped off one of our boats.
He' s headed for the lrish Bayou.
The man that gets him, stays alive!
Now move, you mothers!
Toby.
I got me a regular Ben Hur down here.
Doin '95, minimum.
- Need any help, JW?
- Hell, no!
You got a set of wheels that just won' t quit, boy!
If they' s yours, that is.
You spin around, boy.
Ten fingers on the fender.
Legs apart.
I' m sure this ain' t exactly your debut at this sort of thing.
You picked the wrong parish to haul ass through, boy.
Nobody cuts and runs on Sheriff JW Pepper.
And that' s him speakin 'that, by the bye!
What the...
JW?
Soon as you nail that offendin 'vehicle, Miss Pearsonjust called.
Seems her dog' s foamin 'all at the mouth.
She' s got him locked up in the shed and wondered ifyou' d like to come over and shoot it for her.
You tell Miss Pearson to take a flyin '...
That look like a boat stuck in the Sheriff' s car there, Eddie?
Boy, where you been all your life?
That there' s one of them new car- boats.
I hereby do commandeer this vehicle and all those persons within.
And that means you, smartass!
Unit 23 in position.
Ten- four, 23.
Come in, 28.
Seems like Deke Rogers done got his boat stole offthe river but got a new one in his swimming pool.
- Sheriff, get your boys offmy frequency!
- Give me that!
Now you listen to me, trooper boy!
We got a swamp full of Black Russians drivin 'boats to beat the band down here!
Relax, Sheriff.
We' ve got a roadblock waiting for them at Miller' s Bridge.
Unit 26 at Miller' s Bridge.
We' re just about all set here.
D' you hear?
OK, fellas.
Here they come!
All right, out of my way!
I' m in charge here!
You two boys, come on!
I want those two men and their boats apprehended immediately!
I understand.
But, I don' t know where we' re gonna find a boat fast enough to catch 'em.
Call my brother- in- law, Billy Bob.
He' s got the fastest boat on the whole damn river.
Billy Bob' il sure enough fix their ass!
Yeah, call Billy Bob.
There' s two boats, Billy Bob.
They' re movin 'like buttered pigs!
Now, I promised these boys here you' d get 'em.
Don' t let me down.
Cool down, JW.
I' m on my way.
- Want something, boy?
I' d like to borrow this boat, if I may.
Everybody on the river would like to borrow this boat.
Billy Bob, we' ve got 'em spotted.
They' re headed for Hayley' s Landing.
That' s my brother- in- law!
That' s Billy Bob!
Billy Bob' il get 'em!
Hot damn!
Let' s go!
Iet him now speak, or else hereafter...
Headquarters to all units.
Suspects seen proceeding down by Liberty towards Highway 11.
Proceed with caution.
Would you get that chicken coop off the road?!
Did you ever think of gettin 'a driver' s licence, boy?!
Are you sure that was your brother- in- law, Sheriff?
- Felix, what are you doing here?
- We' il get to that later.
Kananga' s in town.
He' s got your girl.
They just took off.
There' s the son of a bitch!
I got him!
What are you?
Some kind of doomsday machine, boy?
Well, we' ve got a cage strong enough to hold an animal like you here!
- Captain, enlighten the sheriff, please.
- Yes, sir.
JW, let me have a word with you.
JW, now this fella' s from London, England.
He' s an Englishman workin 'in cooperation with our boys.
- A sort of secret agent.
- Secret agent?!
On whose side?!
We busted the Fillet of Soul an hour ago.
We came up with nothing but these.
Kananga' s clear.
You should have seen the size of the guy on the boat with him.
Nine feet tall, I swear.
Big top hat, a cockamamie flute in one hand and Solitaire in the other.
The incendiary bombs are set for midnight.
Now, that gives you exactly... 30 minutes.
Watch out for sharks on the way back.
We' il see you for breakfast, Felix.
Good hunting!
You' re going to need these and the shark gun on the way back.
Seems like the party' s started.
My regards to Baron Samedi, man - right between the eyes.
Trouble!
There you are!
And Miss Solitaire as well.
Hardly unexpected, but most welcome.
Whisper!
Two more glasses for our guests!
- What shall we drink to, Mr Bond?
- How about an earthquake?
Welcome home.
Where' s our boy?
He' il be along any time now.
I checked behind a rock and his wet suit is gone.
Keep the change.
It is unfortunate your wet suit was found only minutes before the field was destroyed.
Don' t tell me you' re not insured?
The poppy is a very sturdy flower.
You have been a relatively minor nuisance, in fact.
I find it particularly fascinating.
What is it?
A shark gun, naturally.
With compressed gas pellets.
Ingenious!
Somehow I never thought of you as a poor loser.
I was hoping you would join me to drink to the future.
Miss Solitaire used to know all about the future.
Especially predicting death.
An underground monorail.
Connected to the last refuge of a scoundrel, no doubt.
The heroin leaves here, I take it, carried somewhere by that winch.
Correct again, Mr Bond.
What a quick study you are.
Let me show you exactly how it works.
Where in hell can the man be?
Relax!
He must have got tied up somewhere.
These cans hold 25 pounds each.
There are 20 cans to a shipment, packed in watertight metal containers.
It' s your show, but isn' t there a simpler way of drowning someone?
Drown, Mr Bond?
I doubt you' d get the chance to drown.
Perhaps we could try something on an even simpler vein.
I think you' il find those wounds quite fatal.
Whisper...
The gate.
Slowly, Whisper, slowly, slowly.
Let our diners assemble.
Look out!
Where' s Kananga?
He always did have an inflated opinion of himself.
Oh, James!
How do we get out of here?
We take the train, of course.
Thanks for everything, Felix.
See you tomorrow night at the 21 Club.
Why do you want to travel this way?
What the hell can the two of you do on the train for 16 hours?
Say goodbye to Felix, darling.
Now, the first thing to learn in playing gin rummy is never take a card from the exposed pile unless you really need it.
Gin.
James!
What are you doing?
Just testing an old adage.
"Unlucky at cards..."
- Do hurry up, James.
- Won' t be a moment, darling.
Lock the door as well on your way up, would you, James?
After all, we wouldn' t want anyone to just walk in on us, would we?
For the first time in my life, I feel like a complete woman.
The slightest touch of your hand...
I was always so afraid that a part of me would stay with the past.
But now I know there' s no chance of that any longer.
To be able to reach out and touch you...
Mr Bond.
It' s good to see you again.
Well, that wasn' t very funny!
Now what are you doing?
Just being disarming, darling.
Come on!
Come on!
Hit him!
Hit him!
You' re waltzin '.
Give the suckers some action.
You' re fightin 'like a bum.
Want some advice?
Cold beer here!
if i bet the fight don' t go three rounds, you feel strong?
- Absolutely.
- Cold beer!
- You want good advice?
- Mouthpiece.
All right.
Next a six- rounder between local lightweights Kid Brooks... and Sugar Johnson.
- Hey.
- Say what?
- You got a smoke?
- Yeah, you can have this one.
You' re a bum.
You' re a bum, you know that?
You' re a bum!
You really got lucky tonight.
Spider, here' s loser' s share. $40, less $1 5 locker and cornerman... $5 shower and towel, 7 percent tax.
Comes to 1 7. 20.
You fought a good fight, Spider.
Less $1 5 locker and cornerman, $5 shower and towel and 7 percent tax.
Comes to 40. 55.
- When do i fight again?
Give me a call.
The doctor should be in in about 20 minutes.
Hey, boy.
You guys are gettin 'better every year.
Yeah.
Hey, your old man did pretty good tonight.
Why weren' t you there?
You should' ve seen me.
You guys hungry?
Here you go.
Here you go.
You wanna see your friend Moby Dick, huh?
How you doin ', Moby Dick?
You miss me today?
Here you go.
Say hi. if you guys could sing or dance, i wouldn' t be doin 'this.
And this turtle food i got here, it' s, uh --
This turtle food i got here has more flies in it --
There are more moths in it than flies.
More flies -- More moths -- Who the hell cares?
How you feelin 'this mornin'?
Full of life?
Fine.
How you doin ', killer?
- Fine.
i' m kind of aggravated.
Oh, i' m sorry.
Ain' t your fault.
You don' t wanna hear about it? i' il tell you somebody who don' t wanna hear about it.
- How you doin ', Gloria?
The last turtle food i got here had more moths in it than flies, Adrian.
These moths get caught in the turtle' s throat... and they cough, and i gotta smack 'em on the back of the shell... and what do you think they get?
They get what?
Come on.
Shell shock.
What do you think?
You' re startin 'with the bad jokes early, huh?
Well, no. inventin 'jokes ain' t so easy sometimes.
No, that wasn' t no joke.
Hey, how' s my buddy doin 'today?
Yo, Butkus!
They' re a mess.
You gotta pay for that turtle food, rock head.
You know that, Gloria.
- Yo, Rock, how' s your boss?
- Real good.
Hey, Rock, you fightin 'again?
Yeah, a million dollars.
Hey, you.
Where are you goin '?
Where are you goin '?
Where you runnin '?
- Shut up!
- Not the face!
- Mr. Gazzo wants the 200 now. i' m broke!
Mr. Gazzo says i should get the 200 or break your thumb.
You understand?
- Please, don' t -- - What' s your name again?
- Bob!
Listen, Bob.
You understand?
You wanna borrow, you gotta pay the man.
You understand?
Gimme some money.
Gimme some money.
There' s 1 30 here.
That' s it. i' m broke.
Hey, Bob, you' re still $70 light.
You don' t have to break nothing.
Take my coat. it' s worth $50, $60.
Take the coat!
You know, you should' ve planned ahead.
You know that?
You should' ve planned ahead.
We' il fake it. i' il tape up the hand like you broke the thumb!
- Gazzo don' t have to know!
He won' t be wise to nothin '!
Gazzo won' t be wise to nothin '!
Keep the --
He only had 1 30, but i think he' s good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.
Sure, Rocky.
Bob' s good for it.
That' s it for today.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio.
He' s late three weeks. i don' t like it.
Del Rio?
All right, i got it.
How do you spell Del Rio?
- How' d you do last night? - i did real good.
- Did you get the license number?
- Of what?
Relax, Buddy.
Pull it over here. i wanna let Rocky out. i' m gonna talk to him for a few seconds.
Why didn' t you break this guy' s thumb?
- How do you know i didn' t?
- You don' t think i hear things?
Didn' t i give you a job this morning?
- Yeah.
- Why didn' t you break his thumb?
When you don' t do what i tell you to do, you make me look bad. i figured -- Look. i figured if i break the guy' s thumb... he gets laid off.
- Let me do the figuring.
From here on in, let me do the figurin '.
These guys think we' re runnin 'a charity -- they' il get off light.
You understand?
You got it, Rock?
i got it.
How do you spell Del Rio?
- Look it up in a dictionary.
- Come on! i won' t let that happen no more, about the thumb?
You know?
So long, meat bag.
i should' ve broke your thumbs!
Heard you did good last night.
Should' ve seen me.
- Shouldn' t you take a rest?
- No, my back is hurt.
- Your back?
My back is hurt.
You deaf?
No, i' m short.
Hey, yo, Mike.
Where' s my lock?
Whose stuff is this in my locker? it' s Dipper' s stuff. it ain' t your locker no more.
What you talkin 'about? it' s been my locker for six years.
Where' s my gear?
Mickey told me to bag it and hang it.
You put my stuff on skid row. i been in that locker for six years, and you put my stuff on skid row?
Mickey tells me what to do, i gotta do it.
Where is he?
He' s outside workin 'with Dipper.
- He' s in a bad mood.
- So am i.
Keep your hands up.
Keep your hands up.
Watch the right.
- Shut up!
To the body.
Attaboy.
Time.
Time!
What do you want?
- How you feelin 'today?
- How you feelin '?
- Are you a doctor?
- Never mind.
What' s your problem? i been talkin 'to Michael.
How come i been put out of my locker?
Because Dipper needed it.
He' s a climber.
Do you know what you are?
- You' re a tomato.
- Tomato? i run a business here, not a goddamn soup kitchen.
- Did you fight last night?
- Yeah.
- Did you win?
- Yeah, i won K. O. in the second.
Yeah?
Who' d you fight?
Spider Rico.
He' s a bum!
- You think everybody i fight is a bum.
- Well, ain' t they?
You got heart, but you fight like a goddamn ape.
The only thing special about you, you never got your nose busted.
Nice and pretty and what' s left of your mind. i think i' m gonna go take a steam.
You know why?
Because i did good last night, and you should' ve seen me.
- Big deal.
- You should' ve seen me too.
- You ever think about retiring?
- You think about it.
- Yeah.
All right, time.
- Time!
- What? i dig your locker, man.
Whew!
Good night to catch pneumonia, you know?
You need some help?
There' s a good game at the Spectrum tonight.
You wanna go to a basketball game?
Hi, kid.
Tough day today.
They took my locker away. i had that locker for six years. it don' t bother me.
Lockers are bad, anyway, after a while.
People get the combination. i must' ve had 20 bucks taken out of there in the past 6 years.
Don' t sound like much, but it adds up.
Doesn' t matter.
Who cares?
Yeah, cold night.
Hey, birds.
Hey, look who' s here.
Look who' s here.
The giant worm.
Look at these birds.
Don' t these birds look like flying candy?
Bird, you wanna fly me home?
You need somebody to walk you home?
it' s a cold night. if you got the money, take a cab.
Too many creeps around here.
Every other block, there' s a creep.
You can always tell a creep.
Listen. i' m gonna go now, okay? i' il see you later, all right?
None of you guys get up. i know you had a hard day in the cage.
So, uh... i' m gonna go home, make up a joke. i' il tell you a new joke tomorrow.
Good night, Adrian.
Good night, Rocky.
Don' t know what happened.
Hey, there, Lefty.
Got a friend for you here.
- Hello, Rock.
- How you doin '?
- You seen Paulie?
- Yeah.
What' s with the eye?
- Been fightin '.
Oh, yeah, did real good.
You should' ve seen me.... heavyweight champion of the world Apollo Creed at Kennedy Airport.
Hey, Rock, who' d you fight?
Spider Rico.
Jesus. is he still around?
Yeah, he' s doin 'real good.
Hey, Paulie.
What, do you lock the door?
Yo, Paulie. i' d like to kill the freakin 'moron who broke the mirror.
Hey, yo, Paulie.
Every day, every night, i pass by.
Your sister' s givin 'me the shoulder.
- Forget her.
- What do you mean?
- You can do better than her. - i don' t forget nothin '.
Every night i pass by, i tell a joke.
Every morning i pass by, i tell a joke.
She just looks at me, you know what i mean?
- Looks?
- Yeah, like i' m a plate of leftovers. i need a Cadillac to connect with your sister?
Somethin 'wrong with my face?
She' s a freakin 'loser.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, i could split her head with a razor.
- Don' t get mental.
- You caught me in a bad mood.
- You' re always in a bad mood.
- Adrian ain' t sharp.
Adrian is a loser.
She' s pushin '30 freakin' years old. if she don' t watch out, she' s gonna die alone. - i' m 30 myself.
- And you' il die alone. i don' t see no crowd around you neither. i' d like to kill the freakin 'moron who broke the mirror.
Let' s get out of this stink.
- i wanna talk to you anyway.
- About what?
- You still work for Gazzo?
- Yeah, sure.
Why don' t you talk to him about me? i just don' t think Gazzo' s hirin 'right now.
Come on.
- The girl' s dried up.
- Who?
My sister. if she don' t start livin ', her body' s gonna dry up.
Tomorrow' s Thanksgiving, you know that?
- Come over and talk to her.
- Sure.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
Absolutely.
You got it. i gotta go. if i' m ten minutes late, she calls the hospital.
- Paulie! - i got it.... Bicentennial fight with Mac Lee Green... here in Philadelphia at the fabulous Spectrum.
You' re speaking now of your much- publicized Bicentennial fight.
This is gonna be the greatest sporting event in the country' s history.
A gala occurrence with me beatin 'Green like he committed a crime.
Would you take a look at that guy? i mean, where are the real fighters gonna come from?
- Clown?
- That' s right, clown.
Apollo Creed will duplicate the cracking of the Liberty Bell by cracking Green.
You' re callin 'Apollo Creed a clown?
What else?
Look at him.
Stay in school and use your brain.
Be a doctor, be a lawyer, carry a leather briefcase.
Forget about sports as a profession.
Sports make you grunt and smell.
- Be a thinker, not a stinker.
- Thanks a lot, champ.
You crazy?
This man is champion of the world.
He took his best shot and become champ.
What shot did you ever take?
Hey, Rocky, you' re not happy with your life, that' s nice.
But me, i got a business goin '. i don' t have to take no shots.... no one having gone more than 1 2 rounds with him...
- Stick that up your business.
- Why you gettin 'so insulted?
You want me to take a shot?
All right. i' il take a shot.
- Hey, Rocky, how 'bout a bottle?
- No wine, man.
- Come on. Just a little.
- Buy us some Thunderbird.
Marie, does your brother know you' re hangin 'out so late?
- Screw you, yo- yo!
These guys teach you to talk like that?
- Stuff it!
- Don' t you never say that to me.
You stink up the neighborhood!
You know, you can --
When i was your age, only one girl in the whole neighborhood talked like that.
That was it. Just one.
What are you doin '? it' il make your teeth yellow.
Don' t do that. i like yellow teeth! - it' il make your breath like garbage.
Nobody likes garbage.
Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn' t bad lookin '... but none of the guys ever took her serious.
They never took her out for any serious date.
- Why?
- 'Cause that' s the way guys are.
They think you' re cute.
You get no respect.
You understand?
You get no respect. i gotta use a bad word: whore.
You understand?
You use dirty words, and maybe you end up becomin 'a whore.
Come on, Rocky. i' m 1 2.
That don' t matter.
You don' t really have to be one.
Bing!
You understand?
"Do you remember Marie?"
Who was she? "
"She was the little whore who hung down at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."
"Oh, yeah.
Now i remember her. "
You see, they don' t remember you.
You understand?
You got a boyfriend?
No, you ain' t got a boyfriend.
You know why?
Why don' t you think you have a boyfriend?
'Cause you' re hangin' out with them coconuts on the corner.
You hang around coconuts, you get nowhere.
They' re lemons.
You hang out with nice people, you get nice friends.
You hang out with smart people, you get smart friends.
You hang out with yo- yo people, you get yo- yo friends.
You see, it' s simple mathematics. - i hope you ain' t -- - i won' t.
What was i gonna say?
You hope i don' t keep actin 'like a whore or i' il turn into one, right?
Good night, Rocky.
- Good night.
Take care.
- Hey, Rocky.
- Yo.
- Screw you, creep- o!
Yeah, who are you to give advice, creep- o?
Who are you?
Definitely.
"a severely cracked third metacarpal in his left hand."
We can cancel the fight indefinitely if you' re set on fighting Green.
Hey, it ain' t just Green.
What about all the time Apollo has invested?
We can find a solution.
Solution nothin '.
Find me another ranked contender in a flash, Jergens.
Don' t play games with my client.
Apollo' s already done a million dollars' worth of publicity... has made contractual obligations with 20 different organizations.
He' s not going to be embarrassed! i contacted Ernie Roman' s manager.
Ernie' s fighting in France that same week.
Then get me Buddy Shaw.
He' s ranked fifth.
Went to California and gained 50 pounds. i called every worthwhile contender.
They all say five weeks isn' t enough time to get into shape.
Shape nothin ', man.
They' re afraid.
They know everybody is gonna see this fight.
None of them' s got a prayer of whippin 'me.
They' re makin 'excuses so they don' t have to be the chump who gets whipped.
All i can say is i' m a good promoter. i' ve promoted fights in every goddamn country in the world... and i' ve broken my ass over this one. i don' t know what else to do!
i do.
Without a ranked contender, what this fight needs is a novelty.
This is the land of opportunity, right?
So, Apollo Creed, on January 1 st... gives a local underdog fighter an opportunity.
A snow- white underdog, and i' m gonna put his face on this poster with me.
And i' il tell you why.
Because i' m sentimental.
A lot of other people in this country are just as sentimental... and there' s nothing they' d like better than to see Apollo Creed... give a local Philadelphia boy a shot at the greatest title in the world... on this country' s biggest birthday.
Now that' s the way i see it.... and that' s the way it' s gonna be.
Apollo, i like it. it' s very American.
No, Jergens. it' s very smart.
- What is it? - i wanna check this thing out.
You said pick up two yards from Snyder and a grand from Cappoli, right?
No, no.
Two yards from Cappoli and a grand from Snyder.
- Two yards.
- Write it down, okay?
Yeah, i got it.
Who' s this girl you' re goin 'out with tomorrow night?
- How' d you know? - i know.
Don' t you think i hear things?
Lot of canaries flyin 'around the docks. - i' m goin' out with Paulie' s sister.
- Hey, Rocky.
- What? - i hear she' s retarded.
She ain' t retarded.
She' s shy, you know?
Tell you what to do.
Take her to the zoo. i hear retards like the zoo.
- This bum gotta say that?
- Who you callin 'a bum?
- Back it up, Buddy. - i' m callin 'you a bum!
Relax, relax.
Buddy' s in a bad mood. it' s his prostate.
He' s always in a bad mood.
You oughta count your blessings.
You' re still a healthy person. - i don' t like your face. - i don' t like yours either!
- Kiss my ass!
- Come out here!
Relax.
My ears.
Both of you.
Buddy doesn' t like you.
Capisce?
- Yeah.
- Come here.
Here' s 50 bucks.
You and your girl Adrian, you have a nice time.
Thanks.
How' d you know her name?
You don' t think i hear things?
- What?
Remember what i told you?
Come on outta the car!
- Some more coffee, Mr. Creed?
- No, thanks, Shirley.
What do you think about Billy Snow?
Fouls.
How about Big Chuck Smith?
No, he' s too old and dumb.
Hey, that Bobby Judge, he' s a good boy.
No. i don' t feel no heat from that name.
Joe Zack' s a good prospect.
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
This is what i' m lookin 'for.
The italian Stallion.
Rocky Balboa?
Never heard of him.
Look, it' s the name, man.
The italian Stallion.
The media will eat it up.
Who discovered America?
An italian, right?
What would be better than to get it on with one of his descendants?
He' s a southpaw. i don' t want you messin 'around with southpaws.
- They do everything backwards.
- Southpaw nothin '. i' il drop him in three.
Apollo Creed meets the italian Stallion.
Sounds like a damn monster movie.
What are you doin 'with that bat? i used to be deadly at stickball.
- She' s very excited.
- Look at these swollen hands.
The joints from carryin 'meat in and out of the freezer.
- Plays hell on the joints.
- Maybe you oughta see a doctor. i don' t need a doctor. i need a different job.
What kind of turkey?
Small?
Talk to Gazzo.
Nothin 'bothers me. i' d make a great collector.
Bustin 'bones don' t bother me.
Big turkey, right?
Gazzo' s gotta gimme -- Forget Gazzo. it' s a bad job.
You got a match?
As a favor.
Yeah, yeah.
Last year, me and the turtles had Spam.
- Yeah, yeah.
She' s very excited.
Will you forget about Gazzo? i don' t ask nobody twice.
Don' t ask nobody twice.
Yeah.
She' s very excited.
Paulie, you' re late.
You call the hospital?
She calls the hospital if i' m ten minutes late.
Yo, how you doin '? i told you, she' s very excited.
Why didn' t you tell me you were bringin 'him here? i' m not ready for this.
Would it make a difference if you were?
- He' s takin 'you out.
- No, i can' t. i want you outta the kitchen right now.
i won' t.
i want you outta here instamatically! i' m sick of seein 'you hanging around like a freakin' spider.
Go out and live.
Enjoy life! i can' t go!
Don' t get wise with me now. i' m tired of you bein 'a loser.
Don' t call me that, Paulie!
Apollo Creed says he' il be shopping for another victim... to fill Green' s vacancy for the Bicentennial championship fight --
Why didn' t you tell me you were bringing him home?
How do you know i didn' t? i can' t go, Paulie. i won' t go!
Why?
Paulie, it' s Thanksgiving. i got a turkey in the oven.
Oh, a turkey in the oven.
You want the bird?
Go in the alley and eat the bird!
Aw, Paulie! i want you outta here!
Go out and enjoy your freakin 'life!
You hungry, Rock?
Hey, yo, Paulie, maybe we better forget all this, you know?
Forget nothin '.
Go ahead.
Tell her somethin 'funny.
Ain' t nothin 'to talk about.
She' s in a bad mood. i' m in a bad mood.
You can do funny things.
You wanna go out with my sister?
- Yeah.
- Well --
i don' t know what to say.
Funny.
Yo, Adrian. it' s me, Rocky?
Rocky, you know?
Listen, uh -- i don' t know what to say, 'cause i ain' t never talked to no door before.
What do i say to a door?
We better forget this.
You' re doin 'fine. i ain' t doin' fine. i look like an idiot.
Keep doin 'what you' re doin'.
Funny. i know all about these things. i feel like a jerk.
Yo, Adrian, it' s Rocky again.
Listen, uh, i know you ain' t too happy at this moment.
But could you do me a favor? i ain' t got nobody to spend Thanksgiving with.
So, uh, how about maybe you and i... go out together, get something to eat.
Maybe laugh a little bit.
Who knows, you know?
Would you like to, uh --
Would you like to, maybe, you and me go out together?
Would you like to?
We' re gonna have a good time.
We' il have a real good time.
Thanks for the bird.
i' m gonna turn the TV off. i got a headache.
- What' s your sister like to do? - ice- skate.
You' re letting the heat out.
Who pays the bills around here?
Listen, i don' t want no turkey anyway, you know?
But it was Thanksgiving.
What? - it was Thanksgiving.
- it looks kind of quiet. - i think it' s closed.
No, i think we' re just early or something like that.
- We' re closed.
- What? - i said we' re closed.
- Yeah.
Hey, listen. i' m gonna smooth this guy out.
Wait here. i' il be right back.
- We could go someplace else.
- No, it' s okay.
Are you closed to the general public, or are you just closed to everybody? it' s after 6: 00. it' s Thanksgiving.
That' s why there' s nobody here.
So do me a favor and not stay here.
- Could you do me a favor?
We' re not operatin '.
This girl here ain' t feeling well.
Doctors say she should go out and exercise. ice- skating' s probably the best thing.
So what do you want from me?
You can see she ain' t feelin 'too good. if you can let her on the ice for a few minutes, i' d appreciate it.
Ten minutes, ten bucks.
Ten bucks?
How about eight bucks?
Come on. it' s Thanksgiving.
All right.
Nine bucks, you got a deal.
Ten bucks.
Give her the blades.
Aren' t you skating?
No, i ain' t skated since i was 1 5.
That' s when i started fightin '.
Skating' s kind of bad for the ankles, you know?
You' re a pretty good skater, aren' t you?
Like i was sayin 'before on the way over here... fightin' used to be tops with me, but no more.
All i wanted to do outta fightin 'was prove i was no bum -- that i had the stuff to make a good pro.
- You never got the chance? - i ain' t cryin 'about it. i still fight. i do it like a hobby.
The trouble is i' m a southpaw.
- What' s a southpaw?
- A southpaw means you' re left- handed.
A southpaw throws your timing off. it throws other guys' timing off, makes them look awkward.
Nobody wants to look awkward.
- You know where "southpaw" came from?
- Nine minutes!
A long time ago, there was this guy -- maybe a couple hundred years ago -- he was fightin 'in the -- i think it was around Philadelphia.
His arm -- he was left- handed.
His arm was facing towards New Jersey.
So naturally they called him "south paw." You see?
Southpaw, South Jersey, South Camden.
You know what i mean?
Things probably worked out for the best, don' t you think?
Never got a chance because you' re left- handed, huh?
That' s absolutely true, you know?
Watch out.
Ah!
Look at that.
Wait. it ain' t your fault.
Look.
See? i had it -- it' s an old wound.
You see that?
Look.
See?
Nothin '. it bends like that. i originally done it -- Push the button.
Bong. it works. - it ain' t your fault.
Look.
- Seven minutes! i originally done it -- i keep pictures of all my fights. i originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.
Baby' s about the size of an airplane. i broke both hands on his face. i lost that fight, but that' s a nice picture, don' t you think?
Come on.
You havin 'a good time?
You can see i ain' t too graceful. i don' t move well, but i can really swat. i can really hit hard.
But i' m a southpaw, and nobody wants to fight no southpaw.
You know how i got started in fightin '?
Am i talkin 'too loud?
Three minutes!
My father, he' s a -- My old man, he was never too smart.
He says to me, "You weren' t born with much of a brain... so you better start using your body."
So i become a fighter.
You know what i mean?
Why you laughing?
My mother, she said the opposite thing.
What did she say the opposite?
She said, "You weren' t born with much of a body... so you better develop your brain."
- Did she say that?
- Yo, time!
Can i ask you a question?
Absolutely.
- Why do you wanna fight?
- 'Cause i can' t sing or dance.
Don' t fall!
That was terrific. i' m pretty good at this.
You like the way i skate?
Last fight i had, i had with this guy named Spider Rico.
He busted my head up there.
You see that scar? i' il tell you, things get pretty rough in the ring.
You know, some people are very shy by nature. i suppose.
i say you' re very shy by nature, you know? i suppose.
The bum from the dark.
Get a job, you bum!
Some people think that being shy is a disease... but it don' t bother me none.
Don' t bother me either.
So why' d i bother bringin 'it up?
'Cause i' m dumb, that' s why.
i think we make a sharp couple of coconuts. i' m dumb and you' re shy.
What do you think?
i don' t understand why anybody would wanna be a fighter.
You gotta be a moron to wanna be a fighter, you know what i mean? it' s a racket where you' re almost guaranteed to end up a bum. - i don' t think you' re a bum. - i' m at least half a bum.
But i' il tell you something.
- Morning after.
Yeah, the mornin 'after a fight... you' re like a large wound, you know what i mean?
Sometimes i got pains all over me. i feel like callin 'a taxi to take me from the bed into the bathroom.
Your hands are swollen.
Look at this face.
Sixty- four fights.
Look at that nose.
You see that nose?
That nose ain' t never been broken. i had guys bustin 'on it. i had guys chewin' on it, twistin 'and punchin' it. i mean, whack, boom.
These guys are hittin 'my nose all the time.
Never broke it. i' m very proud of that.
That' s rare.
- Why you think?
'Cause... you can' t sing and dance?
Yeah, somethin 'like that.
Hey, you wanna come inside?
No, i gotta go.
Hey, come on. i got some animals. i got these very rare animals inside.
Come on in.
No, i gotta go. i gotta go too -- to the bathroom.
Come on.
No, i gotta go.
Look at this face. is that a face you could trust or what? is it?
What do you think?
Come on in.
Yo, come on.
Click.
Yo, Adrian, you hungry?
No. i got some things in there. if you like sodas, doughnuts or somethin '.
Huh?
No?
Hot in here, you know?
i could go for some music.
Yo, Adrian.
These are the exotic animals i was tellin 'you about.
These are my friends, Cuff and Link. - i sold them to you. - i know you sold them to me.
Remember you were working at that pet shop?
First day you was there, and i came in and bought both these animals? i remember that. i bought this bowl and the animals themselves.
Some food, the marbles that go on the bottom there.
Remember that mountain? i had to get rid of that mountain.
Why don' t you come over here and sit down?
Hmm? it' s a nice couch. i don' t know.
There' s big bugs in there. it' s safer over here.
You wanna sit down?
Uh, these your parents?
Yeah, that' s both of them there. is this you?
Yeah. i was eight years old.
That' s the italian Stallion when he was a baby.
Relax.
Do you have a phone?
No, i had it pulled.
'Cause people calling all the time... and who needs the aggravation, right? interruptions?
Who' d you wanna call? i wanna let my brother know where i am.
Why?
i think he might be worried. i' il call your brother, if that' s the problem.
Yo, Paulie!
Your sister' s with me! i' il call you back later!
See ya!
You don' t like the room, do you? - it' s fine. - it' s only temporary. it' s not that.
What' s the problem?
You don' t like me?
You don' t like the turtles?
What' s the problem? - i don' t think i belong here. - it' s okay.
i don' t belong here.
Well, you know, it' s okay, 'cause you' re my guest.
i don' t know you well enough. i' ve never been in a man' s apartment alone.
Well, they' re all the same, you know?
i' m not sure i know you well enough.
i don' t feel comfortable.
Yo, Adrian, i ain' t so comfortable either.
i should go.
Don' t go, please.
Don' t go.
Don' t go.
Do me a favor.
What?
Take off these glasses.
You have nice eyes, you know?
Do me another favor?
Why don' t you take off that hat?
i always knew you was pretty.
- Don' t tease me. - i' m not teasing you.
i ain' t teasing you.
i just wanna -- i wanna kiss you.
You don' t have to kiss me back if you don' t wanna... but i wanna kiss you.
- Heard you had a fight comin 'up.
January 2 7, right?
That' s good.
Come down to the gym.
- 1 7 5.
How you doin '?
Mick was looking for you up there, man.
You' re sure?
- Yeah, yeah.
He' s looking for you.
- He wanted me?
You got somethin 'for me?
Yeah, there was some guy from Miles Jergens lookin 'for you.
They need sparring partners for Apollo Creed.
- When was he here?
- About an hour ago.
They' re probably lookin 'for sparrin' partners for Creed. i said that before, you dumb Dago!
i been comin 'here for six years, and six years you been stickin' it to me.
- How come?
- You don' t wanna know!
Yeah, i wanna know how come.
- You wanna know? - i wanna know now!
Okay, i' m gonna tell ya!
You had the talent to become a good fighter, and instead of that... you became a leg breaker for some cheap, second- rate loan shark! it' s a livin '. it' s a waste of life!
Yes.
May i help you?
Oh, you must be Mr. Rocky Balboa.
Mr. Jergens' s expecting you.
Just a moment.
Mr. Rocky Balboa to see you, sir.
Fine.
- Please go in, Mr. Balboa.
- Can i have that?
- Oh, certainly.
- Thanks.
Mr. Balboa.
How are you?
George Jergens.
Take a chair, please.
Thanks.
Mr. Balboa.
Call me Rocky.
Rocky, you got any representation?
You have a manager?
Uh, no, just me.
Rocky, i' ve got a proposition i' d like to make to you.
- About sparrin '?
- Beg your pardon? i know you' re lookin 'for sparrin' partners, and i' m very available. - i' m sure you are.
- Absolutely.
Sparrin 'with the champ would be an honor, and you know what, Mr. Jergens?
- What? - i wouldn' t take no cheap shots. i' d really be a good sparrin 'partner.
You don' t understand me, Rocky.
My proposition' s this.
Would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed... for the world heavyweight championship?
Listen, Rocky.
Apollo' s seen you fight.
He likes you.
He wants to fight you.
Well, it' s just that, you see, uh... i fight in clubs, you know, and i' m really a ham- and- egger.
This guy, he' s the best, and, uh... it wouldn' t be such a good fight, but thank you very much. i appreciate it.
Rocky, do you believe that America is the land of opportunity?
Apollo Creed does... and he' s gonna prove it to the whole world... by giving an unknown a shot at the title.
And that unknown is you.
He picked you, Rocky.
it' s the chance of a lifetime.
You can' t pass it by.
What do you say?
We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.
Apollo, how do you like the City of Brotherly Love?
Well, just being in Philadelphia makes me feel patriotic.
Beautiful people in a beautiful city coming up to me on the street... wishing me the best. i love my Philadelphia brothers, and i' m proud to be an American.
Why did you agree to fight a man who has virtually no chance of winning? if history proves one thing...
American history proves that everybody' s got a chance to win.
Didn' t you guys ever hear of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?
Apollo? it is a coincidence that you' re fighting a white man... on the most celebrated day in the country' s history? i don' t know. is it a coincidence that he' s fighting a black man... on the most celebrated day in the country' s history?
- Right on, Apollo!
- Tell the truth, brother!
How do you feel about your challenger?
How do i feel about him?
Come here, Rock.
My main man.
- Yeah, i' m italian.
Now what does that mean?
That means, if he can' t fight, i' il bet he can cook.
His lungs, punch out.
Paulie.
Rocky, how do you expect to fight Apollo Creed?
Oh, jeez, you know, Creed' s the best. i guess i' il have to do the best i can.
Tell me, Rocky, just between us... where did you get the name "italian Stallion"?
Oh, uh, i invented that about eight years ago when i was eatin' dinner.
Rocky, now your payday will be $1 50, 000.
- You got no comment, Rocky, right?
- Thank you, Rocky.
- Wait a minute. i just wanna say hi to my girlfriend, okay?
Yo, Adrian, it' s me, Rocky.
You believe all this?
You didn' t.
- Thank you, Rocky.
- Who you pushin ', man?
- Thank you, Rocky.
Don' t it matter he makin 'you out a fool? i' d break his lips.
- He' s takin 'cheap shots.
- Don' t bother me none.
Yo, Rocky, i guess you' il be lookin 'for people to help you out.
Help what?
You know... keep you livin 'the clean life. i do okay, you know.
You need someone to help with the exercise... and someone standin 'by with a towel or runnin' errands?
Hey, yo, Paulie, who cared about me yesterday?
Nobody.
So i just think i' m gonna train myself, you know?
Without such good people around to help you... you don' t have such a good chance.
Einstein flunked outta school twice.
Yeah.
Beethoven was deaf.
Helen Keller was blind. i think Rocky' s got a good chance.
Want me to get you a beer, Paulie?
You lookin 'to do a good deed?
Keep outta my freakin 'life!
- What' d i do?
- Nothin '.
Did i say something wrong?
You didn' t say nothin '. it' s all right.
You didn' t say nothin '!
Nothin 'at all!
i gotta go.
Where are the freakin 'pretzels?
i' d like to have a pretzel.
Hey, we ain' t got any beer?
i thought you were supposed to pick up some beer!
How' d you like hearin 'your name on TV tonight?
Uh... i was shocked.
Why' d you do that?
You' re puttin 'me on, right?
Absolutely.
- What time should i expect you?
- Okay.
You know how i said that stuff on TV didn' t bother me?
it did.
Listen, the reason i brought you here is because i... i wanna know if you got any money for training expenses. i got a few dollars.
A few bucks?
Put this in your glove.
- What' s this?
- 500 bucks.
Don' t worry about it.
You know, you ain' t never had any luck... but i think this time Lady Luck may be in your corner.
- What do you think?
- Maybe.
Thanks for the money, Tony. it' s okay.
Don' t worry about it. i' il see ya.
- Wait a minute.
You' re in trainin '.
Come on.
- Yo, Tony.
- What?
You gonna show up at the fight?
Ringside.
i' il see ya.
Hello, kid. i seen your light.
Can i come in?
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.
Hey, it' s a nice place here.
Anyway, what i come to tell you is that... that what happened to you is freak luck.
- Yeah, freak luck.
- Ain' t it true?
Look at the other guys.
They' re good fighters, right?
They got good records.
They fight their guts out for peanuts.
But you, you got a shot at the title!
Freak luck is a strange thing, you know?
- Sure is.
- Yeah, sure.
- What the hell are those?
- Domestic turtles.
The one on the top is Cuff and the other guy' s Link.
The rest are marbles.
They make good soup.
You gotta be very careful about this shot that you got at the title.
Because, like the Bible says... you ain' t gonna get a second chance.
All right.
You thought of that, huh?
Well, what you need... is a manager.
A manager.
Listen to me. i know, because i been in this racket for 50 years.
- 50 years, huh?
- 50 years. i' ve seen it all.
All of it.
You know what i done? i have done it all.
You should' ve seen me when i knocked Ginny Russell outta the ring.
Outta the goddamn ring, i tell ya.
September 1 4, 1 923... and it was the same night that Firpo knocks Dempsey outta the ring.
So who gets the publicity?
Figure that out.
- That' s right.
But why?
- 'Cause he was champ.
- No!
Because he had a manager. i had nothin '.
i wanna show you somethin '. i want you to look at my face.
Look at this. i got 2 1 stitches over this left eye. i got 34 stitches over this eye.
You know i had my nose busted 1 7 times.
The last time was in that fight with Sailor Mike. i got that clippin 'here. it was a good fight.
Wanna read that?
Well, it doesn' t matter.
Anyway, he put this vegetation on my ear.
You kind of remind me of the Rock, you know that?
- You really think so?
- That' s right.
You move like him, and you got heart like he did.
Yeah, i got heart, but i ain' t got no locker, do i, Mick?
Uh... anyway --
You know, when i begun in this business, kid -- i wanna make a suggestion.
Don' t drink that piss before a fight. it' s no good for you. if you don' t mind my sayin '.
Anyway, you know, when i started in this racket... pugs like us, we was treated like dogs.
For ten bucks, you gotta tear somebody' s throat out.
But i never had no management.
One time, this son of a bitch that i fought... he put a nail right there. - in his thumb. - in the thumb of the glove.
He punched so many holes in my face, i had spit shootin 'outta my cheeks.
Can you imagine that?
Anyway, when i tell you what i looked like when i was in my prime... i want you to look at somethin '.
Look at that.
That' s the way i looked... before these guys got at me.
That' s nice.
You didn' t take very good care of the picture, though.
Well, i never had no management.
That' s the trouble, but i got all this knowledge. i got it up here.
Now i wanna give it to you. i wanna give you this knowledge. i wanna take care of you. i wanna make sure that what happened to me doesn' t happen to you.
You know what i mean?
Mick, the fight' s set.
Listen to me. i wanna be your manager.
You follow that?
Fight' s set. i don' t need no manager.
But you can' t buy what i' m gonna give you. i got pain and i got experience. i got pain and i got experience too.
Listen, kid --
Hey, Mick. i needed your help about ten years ago, right?
You never helped me none.
You didn' t care. if you wanted help -- i say, if you wanted help, why didn' t you just ask me, kid? i asked, but you never heard nothin '!
Well, i -- i, uh -- i know i -- i' m 76 years old.
And, uh --
Took you long enough to get here.
Took ten years to come to my house.
You don' t like my house?
My house stink?
That' s right, it stinks! i didn' t ask no favors from you!
Talk about your prime.
What about my prime, Mick?
At least you had a prime! i ain' t had no prime. i ain' t had nothin '.
Legs are goin ', everything is goin'.
Nobody' s givin 'me nothin'.
Guy comes up, offers me a fight.
Big deal.
Wanna fight the fight?
Yeah, i' il fight the big fight. i' m gonna go fight that big fight and i' m gonna get that! i' m gonna get that!
And you wanna be ringside and see?
Do ya?
You wanna help me out?
Do you wanna see me get my face kicked in?
Legs ain' t workin ', nothing' s workin'.
Think i' il go and fight the champ.
Yeah, i' il fight him.
Get my face kicked in.
And you come around here.
You wanna move in with me?
Come on in. it' s a nice house!
Real nice!
Come on in! it stinks!
This whole place stinks.
You wanna help me out?
Well, help me out!
Come on.
Help me out. i' m standin 'here!
it' s only about 28 degrees.
We' il check that forecast. i feel very mischievous, very weird, very -- i got vinyl seats in my car.
When i hit those seats this morning, i just went, "Whoo!" i figure if i' m up, everybody in the Delaware Valley should be up.
At 3 minutes past 4.. 00 in the morning, what else you gonna do?
Hello?
Good morning, Mrs. Kramer.
This is Don Cabot, WYBG Philadelphia?
- How are you this morning?
- What?
You have a lot of nerve callin' me at this hour of the morning!
Good- bye!
Me and Mrs. Kramer are up, and it' s a good morning. i tell you, i need someone to snuggle with.
28 degrees. it' s cold out there.
We' ve been getting away with murder the last couple of weeks.
Our high today could be --
Tonight we' re back down in the 20- degree range.
Tomorrow, with a little bit of luck, we may hit 40.
But it' s 28. it' s awfully chilly.
Make sure you have it bundled up before you bring it out.
Come on. it stinks in here, you know?
Yeah. i know.
Did you kill all these things?
No, across the street.
it' s like an animal morgue. it' s a little cold in here, ain' t it?
Yeah.
Who killed all these things?
Are you crazy, Paulie? if you don' t pay Gazzo, you end up on a hook.
Gazzo' s a good man.
You know that.
Don' t get excited. i know that.
That' s why i wanted you to talk to him about me and the collectin 'job. i can get me outta this stinkin' freezer.
Why don' t you do yourself a favor?
You eat better.
Moo.
You and my sister, how you gettin 'along together?
How do you think? i' m not sure, Rock.
About what?
What' s happenin '?
You really like her?
Sure, i like her.
i don' t see it.
What' s the attraction?
i don' t know.
Fills gaps, i guess.
What' s "gaps"? i don' t know.
Together we fill gaps.
You ballin 'her?
You don' t talk dirty about your sister.
Are you screwin 'my sister?
That' s why i can' t connect you with Gazzo.
Because you got a big mouth.
You just talk too much. - it' s cold in here. i' m goin 'home.
- Cold in here? it is cold in here! it stinks in here, and you stink!
You' re breakin 'the ribs.
if you do that to Apollo Creed, they' il put us in jail for murder.
i' il see you tomorrow mornin ', okay?
- i turned the heat up.
- Thanks.
Your brother' s a good man, but he' s awful pushy, you know?
- You want me to rub you down?
- No, i' m just sore, okay? - i' m gonna just sit here.
- You sure?
Yeah, i' m sure.
Hey, come on.
No foolin 'around, all right? i' m tired.
Adrian, i' m serious now.
There' s no foolin 'around during training. i wanna stay strong.
- You' re not kidding.
- No, i ain' t kiddin '.
- You sure?
- Yeah, i' m sure.
Why don' t you just make the meat, okay?
Okay, i' il make the meat.
- it' s okay. - i' m sorry.
Underneath!
Knock him out!
Hold it.
Hold it, Rock!
You' re drivin 'me crazy.
You' re so sloppy because you' re off balance.
Let' s try this.
Tie it to both ankles.
- Leave about two feet of slack. - i never had good footwork.
Never mind footwork.
Now you' re all balanced.
Marciano had the same problem... and this string cured it. if you can move and hit without breakin 'the string, you got balance!
You become a dangerous person.
- Thanks.
- Let' s go.
That' s it.
- Underneath it.
- How 'bout an autograph?
Get outta here!
Don' t interrupt me while i' m conductin 'business.
Move your little chicken asses out.
Hey, listen, kid.
You lay off that pet shop dame.
Women weaken legs.
Yeah, but i really like this girl, you know?
Then let her train you!
Okay, no more foolin 'around.
Okay.
Women weaken legs, huh?
You look great.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
Terrific. i mean, you could be a heartbreak.
You' il walk down the street breakin 'hearts the way you' re lookin'.
Very sharp. i got another surprise for you.
What?
Hey, Butkus.
Come here, kid.
To keep you company when you run.
Come in and meet the family.
The owner never come back?
Gloria says he' s yours if you want him.
What' s he eat?
He eats little turtles.
What' s that, Butkus?
Whose truck is this?
Come on.
One call from me, you' re a celebrity.
You got -- need exposure.
- Don' t breathe on me.
- That' s the big time.
Don' t i know about these things?
What do they want from me?
To watch you train.
What is the matter with you?
This is supposed to be private. - i' m doin 'you a favor.
- You ain' t doin 'me no favors!
You' il make me look bad in front of your sis --
See this cigar? i' m gonna stick it in your ear.
Don' t do these things to me.
You should' ve called me.
Leave a message.
Don' t do that.
My sister really likes you.
i' m gonna kill you one of these days!
Come on.
- Baby!
- Baby.
Here he is, the next heavyweight champion of the world, Rocky Balboa!
We wanna get a brief interview with you.
- What about me?
- What about you? - i' m in charge of the meat.
- Fine.
Stand behind it.
Settle yourself down.
Just a few questions about your unique training method.
Talk to the folks at home.
They really wanna know how you got into this.
This isn' t an everyday thing.
Jimmy, you guys ready?
Rocky, turn around here.
Just don' t take no cheap shots, you know?
No, i won' t do that.
Just relax.
Today we' re here with heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.
- The reason we' re standing in this - The meat guy' s stickin 'his face in.
Let' s try it again, Rocky.
Today we' re here with heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.
The reason we' re standing in this refrigerated box... is that Mr. Balboa has an unusual method of training. in a moment, he' il demonstrate that for the viewing audience at home.
But first, Rocky, how did you come to train in an icebox?
Uh, well, uh, my friend, the guy over there... he let me in one day, and i hit the beef here and liked it... and since i' ve become a challenger, the owner don' t mind that i come in. is this a common training method?
Do other fighters pound raw meat?
Naw, i think i invented it.
- Would you give us a demonstration?
- Confirm the reservation... for my people at ringside, and fly my barber to Philly.
How much is being channeled into West Coast closed- circuit advertising?
- Make it 450.
And send the mayor' s wife 200 roses from me... and make sure we get a picture of it for all the newspapers.
Do you want to run the 1 5 radio spots in the Midwest?
You can spend your money better in Canadian publicity.
By the way, Apollo, i' ve got friends in Toronto... who can get you a good tax break.
George, i like your friends.
You oughta come look at this boy you' re gonna fight on TV.
- Looks like he means business.
- Yeah, i mean business too.
Shirley, we got any more coffee out there?
Certainly, Mr. Creed. i' il get you some right away.
Diana Lewis in the meat house... with southpaw Rocky Balboa.
And he called the reporters?
Threw my training schedule off.
Don' t be mad at him.
He' s tryin 'to help.
Adrian, i ain' t mad... it' s just that when reporters are around, i get outta joint...
'cause they take cheap shots, and Paulie knows that.
And Paulie keeps askin 'me for a job all the time... but he don' t know nothin' about fightin '.
Are you gonna say anything to him?
What' s to say? i just don' t know what he wants from me.
i don' t want nothin 'from you.
i don' t want nothin 'from you.
This ain' t no charity case.
Get outta my house. it' s not just your house.
You' re no friend no more.
- Get outta my house, i just says.
- Don' t talk to him like that.
Both of you get outta my house!
it' s cold outside, Paulie.
i don' t want you messin 'her... and i don' t raise you to go with this scum bum!
Yeah?
You wanna hit on me?
Come on! i' il break both your arms so they don' t work for you.
That' s what i think of Gazzo!
Now you' re a big shot fighter, you don' t even throw a crumb to your friend.
When i go and get your meat every mornin '!
And then i even give you my sister too!
- Only a pig would say that! - i' m a pig?
A pig gets you the best?
You' re loser! i don' t get married because of you!
You can' t live by yourself! i put you two together, and don' t you forget it!
You owe me!
- You owe me!
- What do i owe you?
You' re supposed to be good to me!
What do i owe you, Paulie? i treat you good! i cook for you, i clean for you, i pick up your dirty clothes! i take care of you, Paulie! i don' t owe you nothin '!
And you made me feel like a loser!
i' m not a loser!
- You' re busted!
- What?
You' re not a virgin!
You let a man take down your pants!
She' s busted!
i can' t haul meat no more!
You want a roommate?
Absolutely.
Why?
Because i waited for 50 years... to make you ready.
You' il be able to spit nails, kid!
Like the guy says, you' re gonna eat lightning... and you' re gonna crap thunder!
You' re gonna become a very dangerous person.
Yo, Mickey.
Hey, how are ya?
Al Salvani.
- Take a look at his eye.
- How ya doin ', Al?
- That' s right. - it ain' t bad.
- You ain' t so bad yourself.
- Cover up.
Things' il be okay.
You cover up.
Go and take a shower.
Okay, Mick. i' il see you tomorrow.
You covered that Whitmore fight?
- Listen.
We got a chance.
He goes to the body like nobody you' ve ever seen.
You just stand by.
We' re gonna win.
Hey, Rock. it' s okay i talk to ya?
Okay you talk to me?
i figured some angle to make some money off your name.
My name?
How' s that?
Advertising. i know about that stuff.
What do you know about advertisin '?
Hey, you can make money off my name, make it, okay? i' m gonna take a shower.
- Wanna help me off with these?
You' re gonna kill him!
Rocky.
What brings you here tonight?
Mr. Jergens, the poster' s wrong.
What do you mean? i' m wearin 'white pants with a red stripe.
it doesn' t really matter, does it? i' m sure you' re gonna give us a great show.
Try to get some rest, kid.
i can' t do it.
What?
i can' t beat him.
Apollo?
Yeah.
i been out there, walkin 'around, thinkin'.
Who am i kiddin '? i ain' t even in the guy' s league.
What are we gonna do?
i don' t know.
You worked so hard.
Yeah, it don' t matter, 'cause i was nobody before.
Don' t say that.
Oh, come on, Adrian. it' s true. i was nobody.
But that don' t matter either, you know?
'Cause i was thinkin'... it really don' t matter if i lose this fight.
it really don' t matter if this guy opens my head either.
'Cause all i wanna do is go the distance.
Nobody' s ever gone the distance with Creed... and if i can go that distance... and that bell rings, and i' m still standin '...
i' m gonna know for the first time in my life, see... that i weren' t just another bum from the neighborhood.
Time, kid.
Let' s go.
i' il wait for you here.
How 'bout i wait here and you fight, huh?
You' re lookin 'very great today, you know that?
i gotta go now, but, uh, don' t you leave town, huh?
Wish me luck. i' m gonna need it.
Good luck.
Adrian, you don' t think this robe is too baggy, huh?
Good luck.
Don' t leave town.
i' d like you to meet my colleague, Stu Nahan.
Thank you, Bill Baldwin.
The electricity is all over the place tonight, as Rocky Balboa --
What is that? i trained you to be a fighter, not a billboard. - i' m doin 'it for a friend.
Paulie gets three grand. i get the robe.
Shrewd.
The story about tonight' s fight, their difference in style... you can quote a recent sports magazine which said... it could be "the caveman against the cavalier." i notice a buzzing in the background.
Could be the challenger is getting ready to get into the ring.
Rocky, look at my date.
- Cost me $200.
- 250. i gotta go. i gotta work.
- How' s the robe?
- A little baggy.
A 50- to- 1 underdog living a Cinderella story... and he' s captured people' s imaginations all over the world.
We love you, Rocky!
- Good luck, champ.
- Thanks for showing up.
And his record, 44 victories.
He' s had 38 by knockout, and he' s lost 20 fights.
Which makes me wonder, can he stand it?
You know, the stamina and the skill to last three rounds.
Because Las Vegas odds say no.
Rocky Balboa, climbing into the ring now.
The italian Stallion.
Some meat sign on the back of his robe.
You seen what that was?
Shamrock Meat --
There' s a lot of noise coming from the background.
- They have spotlights. - i see right back there. is that the world heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed?
He' s riding in a boat. is he supposed to be George Washington?
Obviously so.
He' s got the hat on, the whole thing.
The world champion, Apollo Creed... is doing an imitation of George Washington.
He' s throwing money.
Remember when we were growing up, we were taught about George Washington... throwing a dollar. if you threw a dollar in those days, it went a lot farther.
The hat came off.
i want you!
The crowd is loving every minute of it.
- Here is the world heavyweight champion.
For you around the world... he was dressed as George Washington, the father of our country. i want you!
i don' t believe what i' m seeing.
Uncle Sam himself! i want you! i want all of you!
He looks like a big flag. i want you! - is he talkin 'to me?
- He' s talkin 'to you. - is he talkin' to me?
- Let him talk. i want the Stallion!
He says, "i want the Stallion."
For you in foreign countries, during World War i... the picture of Uncle Sam with his finger pointed like that... was a recruiting poster for our fellows in the service... the army and the navy -- "i want you."
That' s what he' s doing a take on.
He' s yelling, "Creed in three."
What do you think that outfit cost?
Good evening.
A very Happy New Year.
Welcome to Philadelphia.
Everybody who' s anybody is here tonight.
Time does not permit me to introduce... the many luminaries of politics... show business and the sporting world who are with us tonight... but i would like to present... one of the immortals of pugilism... a champion in and out of the ring...
Philadelphia' s own "Smokin' Joe"... the beloved Mr. Joe Frazier!
How ya doin '?
Don' t hurt him, okay? i' il try not to.
Now he' s coming over to talk to the champ.
- Hey, Joe.
- You been duckin 'me a long time.
You' re next.
- You' re next.
They must be friends.
Joe Frazier!
- Don' t stay in the arena! - it won' t be long now.
Now for the main event.
On my left... the challenger, in white trunks... weighing 1 90 pounds.
Philadelphia' s favorite son...
Rocky Balboa.
The Master of Disaster... the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world...
Apollo Creed!
i want you!
You, chump. i want you!
You' ve both fought in Philadelphia before.
You know the rules.
No low blows, watch your heads, no butting.
Shake hands and come out fighting.
Put your hands up there, chump.
- Come out fighting.
- Come on!
Rocky' s just going over and being calm, it looks like from here.
There goes the big hat.
i' ve never seen a fighter that concerned about his hair.
There' s the bell for round one.
The fighters come in the center of the ring, looking at each other.
Right there.
The champ stinging the slower challenger with jabs at will. in fact, it looks like Rocky is blocking the blows with his face.
The champion doesn' t look the best he' s ever been, but he' s moving now.
The champion' s smiling now.
He' s toying with him.
Trying to give the fans their money' s worth.
it' s very badly outclassed challenger right now.
He' s trying to make his man miss like that.
The champ is just taunting him.
Creed dancing around.
i don' t believe this!
The champ is down!
Creed is down!
What a surprise this is!
This is the first time the champion has ever been knocked down.
The referee is giving him the count.
Six, seven, eight.
He appears to be all right.
Glassy- eyed but okay.
Go to the ribs!
Go to work, Rock!
Rocky coming back out, and he' s like a bull in a china closet.
Apollo, left to the head.
The champion' s coming off the floor... and he' s trying to put him away.
A left, a right.
That' s the Apollo we know.
Now the champ is taunting Rocky to come and get some more.
A left.
Another left.
Rocky' s coming back!
Rocky' s got him on the ropes!
Let' s break it.
There' s no way we expected this kind of hitting.
He' s got him up against the ropes.
They' re leading him to his corner.
Rocky can' t find his way. i called it!
- Your nose is broke.
- How' s it look? it' s an improvement.
Quit shuckin 'and jivin'!
Go for the ribs.
Don' t let that bastard breathe.
The guy' s quick.
He doesn' t know it' s a damn show.
He thinks it' s a damn fight.
Finish this bum, and let' s go home.
Stay to the body.
You' re doin 'great!
Round two.
Creed predicted he' d win in it in three.
Creed got knocked down in the first.
He' s working now.
A sharp left.
Again, a hard right.
He' s knocked him into the corner again.
The champion' s got him backed into the corner.
Pummeling him left and right, his head bouncing against the ropes.
Balboa' s taking a tremendous beating here.
Battering him like a punching bag.
What' s keeping him up?
- He says he wants more!
He wants more.
You folks watching television around the world... you' re watching a battle.
Balboa trying to fight back.
Oh, he tagged the champ!
The champion is trying to get out of there, but he can' t do it.
He is being barraged with lefts and rights to the head and body.
Balboa is tagging the champion right on the kisser!
The referee steps in.
They' re ready to keep going.
Back to your corners!
Come on, Creed!
This is gonna be a tough one.
Hard left and right combination!
- What is keeping him up, Bill? - i don' t know.
He can' t even get his gloves up to protect himself.
Down!
Stay down!
Apollo has his arms in the air!
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Eight.
Come on!
Apollo can' t believe it.
The champion got a left to his right ribs.
Okay, champ?
Yeah, i' m okay. i may have broke my ribs. i can' t see nothin '.
- Cut me.
- Don' t wanna do it.
- Go ahead.
Cut me.
Oh, God.
You' re bleeding inside. i' m gonna stop the fight.
You ain' t stoppin 'nothin', man.
You stop this fight, i' il kill ya!
The 1 5th and final round.
They look like they' ve been in a war.
The champion really tagged him.
Apollo clearly protecting his right side, his ribs.
Hard lefts and rights.
Look at the blood coming out of his mouth!
He' s spitting up blood now.
A tremendous right hand by Rocky.
Go for it, Rock!
- Listen to this crowd!
- Right to the ribs.
Right to the jaw!
He' s got him up against the ropes!
Ain' t gonna be no rematch.
Don' t want one.
Rocky, you went the distance, 1 5 rounds.
- All right.
- What were you thinking about...
Adrian!
Rocky!
- Rocky! we have had the privilege of witnessing... the greatest exhibition of boxing stamina... in the history of the ring.
Ladies and gentlemen... we have a split decision.
Judge Walker --
... for Creed!
Adrian!
- Your fans want a rematch -- - Ain' t gonna be no rematch!
- Adrian!
- You heard him --
- You can' t go in there!
- That' s my friend.
- You' re wreckin 'the jacket!
- Paulie.
i love you! i love you!
- i love you! - i love you!
i love you!
I thought you might ring, Mr. Nyman.
Here are some painkillers to ease you along.
- Should I close the window?
- No, I' d like some fresh air.
- That' s good.
The doctor would like you to be up and about as much as possible.
Do those work better than your regular creams?
I hope so...
Are you playing this to bug your poor old dad?
No...
It' s good music... too.
When you were little, you were proud that your dad was a policeman.
You bragged about it...
I grew up.
And the police force has changed too.
- Yes.
- With Kollberg?
- No such luck.
It' s Rönn, so I' m less than thrilled.
Sit down...
- To mark the guy.
He sold bad dope, bad dope that killed my buddies.
17 of my friends are dead, get it?
Don' t you get it, cop?
- Let' s cut the crap...
- Seventeen people.
I don' t give a damn.
I' ve been on duty since 8 AM yesterday.
I' ve spent the whole time looking for you.
There' s only one thing left.
- What' s that?
- I know there were two of you.
Who the hell told you there were two of us?
I don' t give a damn what you say...
- Thanks.
- Let' s go.
- Bye.
Homicide, Johansson speaking...
Hang on, Rönn.
I think this is right up your alley.
Goodbye.
There' s been a murder over at Sabbatsberg hospital.
Some unis will join you over by the main entrance.
- What' s your name?
- Andersson.
- When did you get here?
Nine minutes ago.
We were in the vicinity of Odenplan.
He' s a rookie, it' s his first murder.
- Know who the victim is?
- Yeah, it' s Lieutenant Nyman.
But you can' t really tell.
Sorry, but I can' t do that right now.
Bye.
- Beck.
- Rönn here.
I' m at Sabbatsberg.
There' s a unit at the main entrance.
- I' m sorry...
- It happens to the best of us.
- I' ve been a cop for 20 years.
And I' ve never seen anything like this before.
Looks like it was a quick strike.
See why I called you?
- Not because...
- Not because of what?
Not because Nyman was a lieutenant, but because of the circumstances.
The man was slaughtered, his killer must be a maniac.
Sure looks like it.
Rönn...
Looks like it would fit a Mauser carbine.
Think they can lift some prints?
The hilt is grooved.
I' ve got to contact Nyman' s family.
Figure we can wake his wife up at this hour?
Can' t see you have a choice...
Will you come with me?
Parked in a non- parking zone halfway up the curb...
He' s lucky we' re not traffic cops.
Hey...
- lsn' t that him, the little guy?
- Right, that must be Nyman' s boy.
I' il just go get my mother.
My name is Beck, I called you earlier.
I' m Einar Rönn.
Please have a seat...
Well, then...
Mrs Nyman, if you happen to have any sedatives on hand,
I advise you to take some.
Dad has...
There' s a bottle of sedatives in the bathroom, should I go get it?
Now would you please tell me why you' re here?
Stig' s dead and...
And none of us can change that.
Why wasn' t I allowed to see him?
You sounded very odd over the phone.
Your husband' s death wasn' t caused by his illness.
Someone stole into his room and killed him.
I don' t understand...
- We don' t know.
He was found dead.
With a bayonet.
He was caught unawares.
It appears to be a surprise attack.
- But why?
- We really don' t know.
We hoped you could help us out, Mrs Nyman.
Can you think of anyone at all?
- No...
- Did anyone hate your husband?
Who would hate him?
Your husband was a police officer.
Making enemies goes with the territory.
This doesn' t make sense...
- No.
- How about a comment?
- Later...
Stay put...
- Hi, how' s it going?
- We' ve talked to the patients.
But no one' s heard or seen a thing.
These old buildings have thick walls, you know.
- Did you know Nyman?
- Not personally...
But talk to the guys at the Klara precinct.
That' s where he was stationed when he fell ill.
Hello, is Sahlin in?
Nasty business, I just heard it on the radio.
- Nothing in the papers yet?
Hello, did you just leave the crime scene?
Nasty business...
- lnge?
- Wake up.
- What the hell are you doing?
He kind of...
It' s hard to say...
You must have talked now and then.
You couldn' t get close to the guy.
Try.
- The younger men were afraid of him.
- Pelle?
- This way.
I' m innocent.
What time is it?
- What time is it?
- What time is it?
- 4: 55.
I' ve been here since 10: 30, they won' t let me go.
I was in a demonstration.
They can' t detain me for more than six hours.
- Sign for your effects.
- I' m not signing anything.
You didn' t give me a receipt, so I' m not signing anything.
It' s customary...
Okay, I' il sign it myself.
This is an open and shut case.
I' ve spent six hours here without being charged...
- Had he received any threats?
- You could at least talk to me.
- He wouldn' t have told us.
You don' t like my politics.
But I thought we would be able to communicate.
Sorry...
I put it over there, on the table.
Everybody' s being evasive.
Mommy?
- Mommy.
What have you done?
Let Mommy sleep, we' il go clean you up.
Here we go...
Johan...
Hi there, Johan.
Where' d it go?
His diaper leaked, there' s crap all over the duvet.
- Am I running late?
- No, come lie down a little...
- I am.
What' s up?
What' s happened?
Here' s Rönn' s report.
"Saturday, March 27th..."
So what do you think?
That Rönn writes godawful reports.
It sounds pretty grisly.
What did it look like?
Worse than you could possibly imagine.
We' d better catch this guy, and be damn quick about it too.
Right.
- Not much.
Footprints.
No one has seen or heard a thing.
- This could take time...
- Negative on the prints so far.
- Forget about prints...
- I made a cast, though.
Of a boot or shoe with thick soles.
Right now we need to catch the perpetrator.
We need to figure out the motive.
Revenge?
Right, and if it' s revenge...
There might be more killings.
What' s your analysis so far?
Have you asked yourselves who Nyman was?
- Who he was?
- That' s right.
Who was he?
- A police officer.
Not a very conclusive answer.
What was he?
Come on, Martin!
A police lieutenant.
I have to go make a phone call.
- What was he?
- I didn' t really know the man.
Don' t be evasive, describe the man.
- He was a bad cop.
- No, he was a fucking lousy cop.
We' ve got a new suspect in the Ljunggren case.
Come have a look.
He was a blot on the force.
I' m ashamed to have worked at the same precinct, and at the same time, too.
But his reputation was never tarnished.
You know why?
Everyone knows it' s pointless to confront the police.
You can' t win against a regular officer, let alone a lieutenant.
- You' re exaggerating.
- Not really.
It' s second nature for cops to stick together.
- We' re bogged down by team spirit.
- A unified front is important.
- What' s that got to do with it?
- Everything.
Who do you think did it?
Who eliminated Nyman?
Someone who wanted to get even.
You mean it' s a person from Nyman' s past?
Only his name has probably been filed in one of our wastebaskets...
Want to grab a cup of coffee?
I' il stick to tea instead.
- Did you know Nyman?
- Yes, indeed.
Did you serve under him?
- When was that?
- "The vile man from Säffle".
"The vile man from Säffle", that' s what we called him.
- ln the army.
- Like what, for instance?
Like how to slice a pig' s cock off without it squealing.
How to gouge its eyes out, cut off its limbs, skin it, and slit its belly without it screaming.
Want to know how its done?
You start out by cutting its tongue out.
I learned a great deal from Stig Nyman.
Like what to do when you' re shut in a closet with a wild cat.
You weren' t supposed to kill the cat, they were "recycled".
- No...
You pin it to the wall with a knife, through the skin.
- You were a paratrooper, right?
- Stig Nyman was my instructor.
Even if this cat business might have been justified in some way, it wasn' t something you ought to take pride in doing.
- But Nyman did.
- You bet!
- And he continued in this vein?
- No, that' s going too far.
But I do know that he' s abused both his subordinates and our clients.
I' ve heard a few things over the years.
Then wouldn' t he have been reported several times?
You know where those complaints are filed, in the wastebasket.
- What about a higher authority?
A guy like Nyman always had officers that got his back.
They' d swear that he hadn' t done anything wrong.
No outside forces can get to a police lieutenant.
That' s bullshit.
The government wouldn' t throw out reports like that.
- They' d still be on record.
- Now that was a bright idea.
I just remembered Hult, Nyman' s henchman.
lf he' s still on the force he must be a sergeant by now.
You should talk to the guy.
- You left, what do we do now?
- We' ve got loads to do.
Like check the archives of the Parliamentary Ombudsman.
- Mrs Hall is in charge on Saturdays.
- You' il have to deal with that.
I need some facts.
- ls that all right with you?
- Sure...
He' s afraid of that old bat.
Why did they call him that?
"The vile man from Säffle".
Well, he came from Säffle and he was vile.
One of the vilest people I' ve ever met.
We' re the next shift.
You two guard the door and the rest of us will go inside.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Come on in.
- Thanks.
I don' t think I' ve ever owned an ashtray.
When you' re not a smoker, well...
- lsn' t this your day off?
- I usually wear my uniform.
- So, why are you here?
- Stig Nyman' s dead.
I see...
- You knew that already?
- No, but it was in the cards.
His body let him down.
- Did you know Stig?
- Not very well.
- About as well as I know you.
- Not very well at all.
You and I have only met a few times.
- You knew Nyman well, though.
- We worked together for years.
- What do you think of him?
- He was a very good man.
There were many complaints about Nyman.
- That' s news to me.
- I know you knew about them.
A pack of lies.
- Maybe they do.
My record is squeaky clean.
And anyone who tries to smear Stig Nyman in my presence...
Well, then I' d...
I' d shut that person up.
I have my ways of doing it.
I know everything about this job.
- Stig Nyman taught you the ropes?
- Sure, he taught me a lot.
How to copy each other' s reports, even if every single word is a lie.
How to beat up the prisoners.
Where to go to work someone over before bringing him in.
- ls that what he taught you?
- I' ve never heard of those things.
So you never used a saber to disperse a strike?
When Nyman was in command?
- Never knocked down schoolchildren?
- It never happened.
Nyman was supposedly an expert at maintaining order.
- He was the best.
- That' s right.
ln a proposal regarding police conduct during demonstrations, he suggested that the motorcycle division should ram the crowds.
- I know nothing about that.
- The method was deemed too risky.
The officers might get hurt.
Right, I have something else to tell you.
I have something to say, too.
So I look out the window a lot.
Not that there' s much to see...
I do a lot of thinking.
Know what I think about?
I think about my 30 years on the force.
I think about the times people have puked all over me.
How many times they' ve spit at me or cried.
Or called me a pig or a murderer.
I think of all the hanging victims I' ve cut down.
I' ve had to handle decomposing bodies.
Maggots would fall out of my cuffs when I sat down to dinner.
I' ve changed diapers when the kids' moms were dead drunk.
I' ve worked like a dog all my life to preserve law and order.
So decent people can lead peaceful lives.
More violence, more bloodshed...
More and more people criticize the force.
But thanks to your fellow officers, you hang in there.
lf there had been more people like Stig Nyman around, society would look different.
So anyone wanting to whine about the force will have to go elsewhere.
Now it' s my turn.
Stig Nyman' s illness wasn' t what killed him, someone sneaked into his room and murdered him.
We suspect that the killer was bent on revenge and plans to strike again.
I came here to ask you a specific question.
- Who hated Nyman that badly?
- No one...
I' ve got to go.
Go to work.
<i>However, no legal action appears to be called for. </ i>
This is all we have for Lieutenant Nyman during that period.
Will that be all, or should we go further back in time?
No, this will be fine.
Hi, Beck here.
Has Rönn come back to the office yet?
Oh, he hasn' t...
Goodbye.
Nasty business, that officer getting killed.
I just heard it on the radio.
Could we talk about something else?
- You look perky.
- I went to the baths.
What' s up?
20 complaints during the past few years.
I bet I' d still be there if I went back even further.
A sauna?
And maybe even a massage?
I won' t lie to you, I had a massage.
Massage, huh...
You left...
You look a little perkier yourself.
I guess both you and I could use some sleep, but I figured we might get a breakthrough if we keep at it.
- It' s worth a try, isn' t it?
- Right...
Why don' t we check out ten names each?
And go home after that.
Oh, when did he die?
Oh...
Thank you very much.
Mrs Nyman, is it correct that only you, your son, and your husband' s two brothers knew which room he was in?
<i>That' s correct.
My husband didn' t want people to know he was ill. </ i>
<i>Oh, another off? icer knew about it as well, I have his name here. </ i>
<i>Palmon Harald Hult. </ i>
<i> - Why is that?
- Mr Hult called last night. </ i>
<i>He was distressed to hear that Stig was ill. </ i>
<i> - And you gave him the address.
- He wanted to send flowers. </ i>
- Thank you.
- I' ve checked my list.
Two are dead, and I can' t locate the guy named Eriksson.
Right...
<i> - ls Hult in?
- No, he isn' t. </ i>
<i> - Anyone seen him today?
- No. </ i>
Are you sure?
Could you please ask around?
<i> - Ask who?
<i> - ls there only one officer on duty?
- No, hang on... </ i>
<i> - Anybody seen Hult around?
- Who' s asking? </ i>
<i>That hot shot over at Homicide, Beck. </ i>
<i> - Hult went somewhere an hour ago.
- He went somewhere an hour ago. </ i>
<i> - Where' d he go?
- No one knows. </ i>
She told him which hospital it was.
- I wonder why he called?
- Maybe he wanted to send flowers.
Not many people knew that Nyman had been admitted to the hospital.
That must be why Hult called.
It' s an odd coincidence.
When I went to see Hult, why didn' t he mention that he' d been in touch with Mrs Nyman?
Why would he call at night?
At this time of the year, any time after 5: 30 PM is night.
Like I was saying, I couldn' t get hold of Eriksson.
Åke Eriksson.
The police officer who always complained about everything.
<i> - The Nyman residence.
<i>That' s all right, Lieutenant Beck. </ i>
You mentioned that sergeant Hult called last night.
<i> - May I ask what time that was?
- Fairly late. </ i>
<i> - Could you narrow that down please?
- We were watching TV... </ i>
<i>According to Stefan, "Baretta" had just started.
The TVshow... </ i>
You told Hult which ward and room your husband was in.
<i>Hult is dependable, why do you ask? </ i>
It' s merely a routine question.
Thank you very much.
Did you watch TV last night?
That' s right, you were on duty...
Could you find out what time "Baretta" was broadcast?
- 9: 25 PM.
- That means Hult called around 9: 30.
Kind of late, it wasn' t a duty call.
Maybe it was.
He didn' t say much.
But he did find out where Nyman was.
He wanted to send flowers.
Do you think Hult stabbed Nyman?
I would like to discuss that call with him, though.
Call him over the radio.
Call Sergeant Hult on the radio.
Tell him to contact Homicide immediately.
There' s something I' d like to say.
Let' s say I called your house and asked your wife about you.
I would never introduce myself as Einar Valentino Rönn.
- As what?
- That' s my name.
Valentino, like the movie star.
It was Mother' s idea...
What do mean?
That it' s strange that Hult calls Nyman' s wife and introduces himself as "Palmon Harold Hult".
- How do you know his name?
- You wrote it down on your pad.
- ln addition to that...
- What?
It' s also listed in the complaint Åke Eriksson lodged.
Great...
I guess we' il have to take a closer look at Eriksson.
- I don' t remember the details.
- Melander would.
He remembers everything.
I' il give him a call.
Funny, how both you and I are trying to get hold of a cop.
It might turn out to be the same guy.
<i>The death toll is estimated at 500. </ i>
<i>ln Stockholm, the police have no leads regarding the brutal murder</ i> <i>of police lieutenant Stig Nyman. </ i>
Now for sports... </ i>
- I' m sorry to disturb you again.
- You called fifteen minutes ago...
I apologize, I realize this must be painful.
How can I help you this time?
- It' s about that telephone call.
- From Sergeant Hult?
- Did you recognize his voice?
- No, I don' t know the man.
- That' s why I wrote down the name.
- So it could have been someone else?
Wouldn' t it be simpler if you talked to Sergeant Hult?
- Policemen make enemies.
- Yes, you told me that.
The second time we talked.
Are you aware of the fact that we' ve talked five times during the past 12 hours?
I' m sorry, maybe I' d better get to the point.
Some people felt your husband abused his position.
- Are you joking?
- No.
- What were the charges?
Brutality.
- Was that it?
I' m rather busy...
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Christ...
He was a mean bastard.
For once, I agree with you.
That bayonet interests me.
This guy knew his stuff.
So who are we looking for?
People in the armed forces.
So do policemen.
That' s going a bit too far, isn' t it?
Are you working on this case?
- What about you?
- It looks like it.
Hopefully our paths won' t cross too often.
Hopefully...
Could you please go and get him?
- He was a cavalryman.
- What about Eriksson?
- He was an artilleryman.
Are you thinking of the bayonet?
I figured as much.
- What does that mean?
- You can buy them for peanuts.
Just go to an Army surplus store.
... and his teeth were knocked out.
Probably when the perpetrator silenced the victim.
The victim was subjected to lacerations of the abdominal region, and the throat.
Was this done in a rational or frenzied manner?
I' d say it was a combination of rage and cool calculation.
That' s what frightens us.
Lasse, could you climb in through the window?
Thanks...
This might be where Stig Nyman enters the picture...... along with Harald Hult.
There was an incident at their precinct.
Marja Eriksson died in the drunk tank on the night of June 26, 1965.
The events were as follows:
On June 26th, Marja Eriksson and her daughter went to Vaxholm to leave her daughter with a friend while she did some work.
ln the afternoon, Marja went back downtown.
Marja Eriksson was a diabetic, and required insulin injections.
This she did regularly, never compromising her health.
But on this particular day, she forgot to bring her syringe.
Not long after 7 PM, Marja Eriksson was found by two of Nyman' s officers, sitting on a bench in a dazed state.
Her poor Swedish might have made things worse.
So they took her to the station.
According to their first statement, Nyman told them to lock her up.
Later, Nyman denied ever seeing the woman.
And the boys changed their statements accordingly.
The guard on duty claimed that the junior officers made the decision to lock her up.
They blamed each other.
And it hadn' t been possible to transfer the prisoner.
By the time the guard on night duty checked on her, she was dead.
Diabetics usually carry some kind of emergency lD.
That' s right, and Marja Eriksson had a card in her purse.
Only no one searched her.
There were no female officers on hand.
She would have been searched if she' d been transported to Krim.
That is, if she had lived to reach our department.
- Go on...
Claiming never to have set eyes on the woman or her purse.
And the two beat cops took the blame.
All they got was a warning.
- What happened to Åke Eriksson?
But his personality changed.
He turned into a cranky, pedantic, by- the- book cop.
His friends started to avoid him.
He started sending in those complaints.
He reported Nyman and Hult to the Parliamentary Ombudsman.
A year after his wife' s death, his lieutenant had him transferred.
But his co- workers avoided him and he was reprimanded.
Violence?
- No, quite the opposite.
No, he was too pedantic.
It took hours to perform the simplest tasks.
Einar, maybe we should have some coffee and wake up.
- It' s certainly worth a lot.
We don' t stay there during the winter.
What godawful coffee!
Well, I' m no psychiatrist, but...
It seems like he blames the entire force for his wife' s death.
Do you really think Eriksson did this?
Why do it now?
After ten years his lust for revenge must have cooled off.
You' re on the wrong track, but good luck to you!
Listen, do you think Eriksson' s folks are still alive?
Gamla Södertäljevägen 36.
- Carsick again?
I' il have to start taking my bike instead.
When Åke left around 11 PM last night, was he his ususal self?
- Why do you ask?
- It' s just a routine question.
He was... his usual self.
He doesn' t talk much nowadays.
He was concerned about his rent.
And about that business with Malin.
They took the girl away from him.
- And he might lose his apartment.
- He thinks he' il be evicted soon.
Who took his daughter away?
I presume that Malin is his daughter.
That' s right, Malin' s his daughter.
I thought you knew that the Child Protection Services had taken Malin.
- Why?
- Why did the police murder his wife?
Answer my question, please.
- Not without careful consideration.
- Careful, well that' s a laugh.
The neighbors reported him to the Child Protection Services.
- What for?
That he didn' t feed her enough...
To snoop.
They said that Åke' s...... depressive...
They said it had "an adverse effect on the girl' s psyche".
That' s exactly how they put it.
They had talked to his employer too.
They contacted all the supervisors he' d ever had.
- lncluding the police force?
- Of course...
His opinion carried a lot of weight, it seems.
- Yes...
It was that Lieutenant Nyman.
The same man that let Åke' s wife die.
May I have a look?
Thank you.
Larsson...
Do you have to do that?
Back in those days, your son was a top marksman on the force.
- Åke won many fine prizes.
- They' re not here, he has them.
Can you picture what went through his mind afterwards?
- You' re sure it' s a man?
- Women don' t use bayonets much.
And not many wear size 11 shoes.
- Can you picture his mindset?
How the hell could l?
Well, he primarily uses a Mauser rifle.
And he has a handgun.
- What kind of a handgun?
- He won a gold medal.
- What make was it?
- A Hammerli lnternational.
And he also has...
What else does he have?
I don' t know, but with regard to the Mauser and the Hammerli, he' s got a license, you know.
Don' t worry, we don' t think there' s anything wrong with his permits.
Well, I presume he has a license for this one as well...
After all, he' s used it in competitions.
An American automatic rifle.
A Johnson.
What the hell is going on?
- What are you doing, Hult?
- Cordoning off the area properly.
That' s a bloody waste of resources.
Post a guard outside the door.
Hi, could I hitch a ride to the liquor store?
<i>You are requested to report to Lieutenant Beck. </ i>
Well, aren' t you going to call in?
ln due time.
I' m on voluntary duty.
- You didn' t see him, did you?
- It was a godawful sight.
- What' s that, let' s go take a look.
- The car?
No...
- Forget about it...
- I won' t make it before they close.
This is crazy...
I' m out of here.
What happened to Andersson?
- Let go of me!
- You' il get killed!
You in the coat, watch out!
Help!
Help!
Let' s beat it!
Look!
Watch out!
- Why are you in the fountain?
- Go away!
It' s dangerous here.
- But what are you doing?
Beat it, or you' il get a whipping!
Listen up!
Leave the area, you are in danger!
Take cover!
Get inside the buildings!
This is Gunvald Larsson...
I' m at Dalagatan 34.
There' s a madman armed with an automatic rifle on the roof.
Two policemen are down, in front of the Eastman lnstitute.
Full alert in the downtown area.
Seal off Dalagatan and Västmannagatan, from Bantorget to Karlbergsvägen.
And Odengatan down to St. Eriksplan as well..
And all the side streets in the vicinity.
Don' t send any squad cars or officers in uniform to the location.
Assembly at Odenplan.
What?
We' re inside the Eastman lnstitute.
I' il try to get a crack at him soon.
Am I in lndia?
What kind of gun are you packing?
Or are you a fucking pacifist?
I' ve always considered you a loser.
So, how are we going to get out on the street?
Walking out would be suicide...
And the rear windows would take too long.
- Do you know those two guys?
- No.
- Why were they here?
- A parking violation.
The question is why they were shot.
Or why the hell someone' s shooting at us.
That bastard didn' t shoot the kids.
But he obviously recognized us.
He couldn' t have recognized those guys in the fountain though.
- They' re in uniform.
- Someone doesn' t like cops...
Did you see if the sniper' s on the roof or in an apartment?
Look!
- We' re in luck.
- What the hell do you mean?
I' m going to risk it.
- Have another cookie.
- Thank you, I' m fine.
- Do you mind if we look at his room?
- No, that' s...
It' s probably a mess, though...
Those guys that ran inside have put on white coats...
- The sniper' s on the roof.
- At least for now.
- He wasn' t there the last time.
- Let' s check it out.
This way...
This is Åke' s room.
Of course, it looked neater when he was still living at home.
He took his furniture with him...
What do you think of these spots?
Look.
- Your son lives on Dalagatan?
- Yes, number 34, only...
Please go downstairs, we' il be right with you.
Call Strömgren, or whoever' s on duty.
Have him contact Kollberg and get him to call us here.
Make the call first...
- Where are you going?
- To clean up.
It' s filthy.
- Please remain downstairs.
- Go back downstairs!
- What a nasty tone of voice...
- I couldn' t stop her.
Martin, there' s...
All I see are a bunch of pipes...
How about the other door?
Shit!
- What' s going on?
- Wait inside and stay calm.
- What do we do now?
- Go and brief the others.
- I want to get that bastard!
- We can' t reach him.
So what the hell are we waiting for?
Squad cars...
Target practice.
Did you get the names of the tenants up there?
- We need outside access.
Let' s go!
Okay, let' s roll.
Clapper...
- Do we know the sniper' s identity?
- Unfortunately, no.
All we know is that this madman is out for policemen.
Two officers are down already.
We don' t know why he targets cops.
- Now what?
- The subway!
- ls there a plan?
- We' re in the process...
- You look terrible, Larsson.
- Where is Beck?
We need to use specialists here.
Enforcement specialists.
Describe the crime scene.
A madman' s picking off cops with an automatic rifle.
The surrounding buildings aren' t as high, it' il be hard to get him.
We have the resources.
I have a suggestion.
Let' s move inside the sealed- off area.
- The old Gasworks.
- The site of the old reservoir?
Can helicopters land there?
ls it out of range?
- Unless the bastard' s got a mortar.
- All right, gentlemen.
We' il move on to the roof of the old gasworks.
Assembly in ten minutes.
- Do you plan to storm the roof?
- First we want to talk to the man.
I' il use a bullhorn and urge him to give up.
lf he doesn' t, we' il have to strike.
<i>May I have your attention, this is the police. </ i>
<i>ln order to make way for emergency vehicles, </ i> <i>we advise you to vacate Odenplan. </ i>
<i>Please leave the area and head in the direction of Karlbergsvägen. </ i>
Hult!
- I' ve been trying to contact you.
- Really.
Åke Eriksson used your name when he called Mrs Nyman last night.
Åke Eriksson?
- Åke Reinhold Eriksson?
- That' s right.
- ls he Nyman' s killer?
- Looks like it.
- And he' s the sniper on the roof?
He only shoots policemen, according to the report we just received.
- We haven' t opened fire on him yet?
- We' re closing in.
We have established radio contact with our officers.
Tear gas specialists and marksmen have been stationed strategically.
There are only two good spots.
The Bonnier building...
Watch it!... and the Church of Gustav Vasa.
Otherwise, he' il be captured or shot.
We cannot lose any more officers.
- We' re ready to go.
- Thank you.
I' il be right with you.
As I was saying, ladder trucks can be deployed if necessary.
They will be accompanied by policemen in Fire Dept. uniforms.
I have some vital information.
lf our sniper is Åke Eriksson, he could be armed with a Johnson automatic rifle and a Swedish Army repeater.
- Christ, a Johnson...
It only weighs seven kilos and has the punch of a machine gun.
450 rounds a minute.
And the Mauser can pick off a flea 600 meters away.
A little luck and a good scope, and he can ice a guy 1, 000 meters away.
He can do a lot of damage.
Remember, the sniper must be given the opportunity to surrender.
- Let' s go.
- Kiss my ass...
- We should strike from the inside.
- Skip the guts and glory talk.
This is a team of professionals, we don' t need any more amateurs.
Yes, indeed.
Heil Hiltler!
Rest assured I won' t forget that.
Even by to your standards, Gunvald, that was a bad move.
Larsson!
For God' s sake, behave yourself!
Drive up to the spot we call "Claws", we' re safe there.
Then we' il have to pass a short stretch where we' il be in range.
- You' il have to floor it.
- Shouldn' t I use the siren?
- He hasn' t shot any ambulances yet.
- Let' s hope he' il keep that up...
Do you think he' s got his daughter up there?
She' s been taken into care.
She' s not in danger.
Her dad would never hurt her.
<i>Attention please.
This is Commissioner Malm. </ i>
<i>l don' t know you, Eriksson, and you don' t know me. </ i>
<i>But I assure you that the game is up. </ i>
<i>You have ten minutes to surrender in an honorable fashion. </ i>
And if he did surrender, how could you tell without this?
74... 747, this is the Commissioner, over.
<i>747 here, commencing Operation lce- hunt. </ i>
- Would you like a cookie?
- Yes, please.
- Sugar?
- No, a cookie is fine.
642, this is the Commissioner.
Countdown initiated.
<i>Ten, nine... </ i> <i>... eight, seven... </ i> <i>... six, five... </ i> <i>... four, three... </ i> <i>... two... one. </ i>
- Progress to level three.
- Roger.
- Time for level three.
- Was the coffee strong enough?
- I haven' t had any yet.
- Things are heating up, you see.
- I thought it very tasty.
It looks like they' re going to try something else: an airborne strike.
They' re sending in helicopters.
The police have failed to bring about his surrender, so now they are flying in, a fairly risky operation.
- He shot down the helicopter.
- ls that your conclusion?
Where' s Martin?
- We' il have to call in the army.
- What the hell...?
We' il have to call in the armed forces.
- What can they do?
- Drop a bomb.
- Bring in the heavy artillery, or...
- Or what?
Or deploy paratroopers.
We could even drop a dozen police dogs.
- Shut up, Gunvald.
- The Fire Dept., I haven' t...
- It might work.
They didn' t kill Eriksson' s wife.
What happens if he sees that cops are dressed in firemen' s uniforms?
What does Eriksson' s wife have to do with this?
A great deal...
Three people are dead and seven are wounded.
And there are loads of people within range.
What if he gets tired of policemen and starts shooting civilians?
This is a one- man mission.
I' m the man.
- I cannot allow it.
- I' m sorry, but it' s my decision.
What kind of reasoning is that, logic or moral?
<i> - Everything going smoothly?
- Yes. </ i>
<i> - Calling Rönn.
- Rönn here, over. </ i>
<i> - See anything?
- No. </ i>
What happened?
Rönn?
- A fuse blew in the fire truck.
- How' s Martin?
- Rönn here.
- What happened?
- Beck must have bought it...
- Wait!
Our man in the church tower thinks he can see Beck.
He' s lying on a grate on a landing.
He appears to be alive.
- We' ve got to go get him.
- And finish this mess.
Go get your buddy, Kollberg.
And I' il get the son of a bitch.
- What do you think of my odds?
- They' re pretty slim.
I need a rope, could you help me out?
We' il blow the doors and storm the roof.
I need assistance, one or possibly two men.
I don' t want any heroics.
You risk getting shot.
Take me.
You?
Right, I can see that you might want to, Hult.
I' il go.
- Who the hell are you?
- My name' s Bohlin.
- Are you an policeman?
- No, a construction worker.
- I live next door.
- Give the man a gun.
Could I use my own gun?
It' il only take a minute to get it.
- Be careful turning the corner.
- That' s illegal.
And wrong.
It' s damn wrong.
- I' il take this staircase.
As soon as the fuse is in place, run two flights down.
And anyone who kills the sniper will be held accountable.
- Even if it' s in self- defense?
- Yes.
Let' s synchronize our watches.
Why didn' t you shoot?
I don' t understand.
How could you?
Got a license for that gun?
Then expect trouble.
- Black jacket?
- Yeah.
It' s June.
lsn' t it hot for a long leather coat?
- Yeah, a little.
- Yeah.
Look at his partner.
They just came in.
Something' s getting ready to go down.
- Go and cover that guy.
- What' s going on?
I' il check out this asshole at the bar.
Billy will make sure I behave.
Will somebody tell me what' s going on?
No bullshit this time.
Just sit tight, Billy.
Philip!
Man, what' s happening, Phil?
He said you don' t come here no more, but I said, "It' s Phil".
- Get out of here, man.
- I told you!
- Give me a kiss, baby.
- I said get outta here!
Everybody freeze!
Turn around!
- Phil!
- Keep your hands on the table!
What' s all the hostility?
- Get back.
- What' s all this gun, man?
You changed.
Get back or I' il blow your brains out.
Move and I' il kill you.
Don' t move!
Turn over!
You' re some cop.
You know that?
Sorry for the disturbance, folks.
Everything' s under control.
Taggart.
Would you explain why you and Rosewood were in a strip bar out of our jurisdiction while you were on duty?
Before you chastise these officers, there' s something you should know.
The only reason they were at a strip bar is because they were tailing me.
They were outside wondering what I was doing.
I was in having a good time.
I' m into those things.
These guys waited outside and the only reason they came in was because they saw two men with bulges in their jackets going in.
Well, these guys were going to commit a robbery.
They watched them, waited for them to make their move, then foiled a crime.
I did not know what was going on.
They must have a sixth sense.
I don' t know what you teach them, but they' re not just regular cops.
They' re supercops.
The only thing missing on these guys are capes.
ls this what really happened?
No, sir.
Would someone tell me what happened?
Well...
We accepted.
- We ordered club sodas, sir.
- Right.
Foley observed the two suspects casing the establishment.
And before we knew what was going on, he' d already disarmed one of them.
Detective Foley deserves all the credit for the arrests, sir.
I would prefer you did it in Detroit.
I' m sorry.
But before I go I want you two to know, the supercops story was working.
OK?
It was working and you guys just messed it up.
But it' s cool.
Just fuck up a perfectly good lie and it' s all right.
You guys are off the case.
Foster, McCabe, your turn.
- Don' t lose him.
- Not a chance, sir.
And you two...
ln my office.
Morning, gentlemen.
Coffee and doughnuts?
- What?
- Coffee and doughnuts.
There he is.
Morning, officers.
You the second team?
We' re the first team.
We won' t fall for a banana in the tailpipe.
You won' t fall for the banana in the tailpipe?
It should be more natural, brother, like this.
"I ain' t falling for no banana in my tailpipe." It' s more natural for us.
You' ve been hanging out with this dude too long.
That' s funny to me.
- You gonna try to keep up with me?
- No problem.
- lsn' t this Victor Maitland' s house?
- Yeah, I think so.
I' ve seen enough.
You want something to drink?
I got some stuff in the trunk.
Excuse me.
For a man on vacation, you look like you' re on a stakeout.
I' m picnicking.
This is a picnic area.
I' ve been shooting the shit long enough.
Time for me to take in some sights.
Excuse me.
What the hell' s he doing?
Can you put this in a good spot?
This shit happened last time I parked here.
May I help you?
I' m looking for Victor Maitland.
You realise that this is a members only club?
I have to talk to Victor.
It' s very important.
- Yes.
Very dark skin.
Capricorn.
Why don' t you give me the message and I' il take it to him?
OK.
Tell Victor that Ramon, the fella he met about a week ago...
Tell him that Ramon went to the clinic, and I found out that I have... herpes simplex 10.
I think Victor should check himself out with his physician before things start falling off on the man.
Perhaps you better tell him that.
- I think that would be best.
- So do l.
Hi, Victor.
I' m back.
Look, guys, don' t even try it.
Why don' t you get the hell out of here?
Get the fuck away from me, man.
Very good, Victor.
Could you teach him to roll over and sit, too?
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to you.
- Last time, I didn' t get the chance.
- I' ve nothing to say to you.
That' s cool, I' il do all the talking.
This is a very nice place, Vic.
I like this.
This is nice.
Glad you like it.
I must make you a member.
Victor, I know that you' re into a lot of crooked shit.
And I have a pretty good idea that you had Mikey killed.
I' m going to fuck you up real bad.
ls that so?
Now listen to me, my tough little friend.
I don' t know from under what stone you crawled or where you get these ridiculous ideas about me, but it seems painfully obvious you haven' t the slightest fucking idea who you' re dealing with.
Now, my advice to you is crawl back to your little stone in Detroit before you get squashed, OK?
- Please step away from the table.
- Gotta go now, Vic.
- Nice meeting you again.
- Yeah.
Catch you later, Vic.
I can' t wait.
Don' t I know you guys?
You look so familiar.
Detective Foley, this is becoming very irritating.
Why are you bothering Victor Maitland?
I had a friend, Michael Tandino, who used to work for him.
Maitland had him killed.
When I can prove it you' il be the first to know.
Forget what you can prove, talk to me.
OK.
Everybody knows Victor Maitland is a hotshot art dealer.
But I poked around.
Art' s not the only thing he deals.
I saw some guys in his warehouse unloading a crate of German bearer bonds.
Michael Tandino had bonds like this on him, coincidentally, when he was killed.
Just because Maitland invests in the same bonds doesn' t mean he' s a killer.
The man' s not an investor, he' s a smuggler, be it bonds, drugs or whatever.
The crate I saw didn' t even pass through customs.
Maitland is paying to get his shipments out before they' re inspected.
When his guys get it, they take the drugs or bonds out of the crates and they send it back before customs even knows what' s going on.
- And you witnessed this?
- Everything except for the drugs.
But I found coffee grounds everywhere.
- Coffee grounds?
- What does that mean?
Drugs are packed in coffee.
The scent throws off the dogs.
Very good.
Now what do we do?
Look, Detective Foley, I...
I' m sorry.
I' d really like to help you.
lf you' d found the drugs, that' s one thing, but if your only evidence is coffee, we can' t get a search warrant.
We can get around that.
We don' t "get around" search warrants.
Taggart, I want you to start checking this out.
Start with the LAPD, the FBl and the Customs Service.
Wait a minute.
Maitland is much smarter than that.
We snoop around, he' il close down and get his shipments from elsewhere.
Really? ls that what your extensive experience tells you?
I haven' t been on the force...
Shit.
- ls this the man?
- Yes, sir.
Who disabled an unmarked unit with a banana?
Yes, sir.
Who lured Taggart and Rosemont into a gross dereliction of duty at a striptease establishment?
It' s Rosewood, sir.
Yes, sir.
ls this the gentleman who ruined the buffet at the Harrow Club today?
Yes, sir.
I just bet you are the pride of your department in Detroit.
Lieutenant, I' d like to see you in your office.
Yes, sir.
ls this the man who wrecked the buffet at the Harrow Club today?
- Lower your voice.
- Can he hear me through the wall?
Yes, he can.
Rosewood, take Detective Foley back to his hotel room, watch him pack, and escort him to the city limits.
Then you can give him his gun back.
The two charges of disturbing the peace have been dropped against you.
But if you return to Beverly Hills, the charges will be reinstated and you will be prosecuted to the limit of the law.
- Sir, may I say something?
- What?
He seems to have enough...
You want to tell that to the chief?
- No, sir.
- Then I suggest you get moving.
Come on, Axel.
Let me check on that tomorrow and get back to you.
Thank you.
- Hi.
- Victor, hi.
- Sit down.
I' m not interrupting?
- Of course not.
There' s a gentleman in town from Detroit who says he' s a friend of Michael Tandino.
He came by the office yesterday and asked me all sorts of odd questions.
Excuse me, darling.
I believe his name is Foley.
I was wondering if you knew the fellow.
We grew up in the same neighbourhood.
Have you seen him lately?
He came in yesterday.
He came by here?
And?
He told me that Mikey had been killed.
Yes, I know.
- And then?
- That' s it.
He left and I haven' t seen him since.
Jenny, darling, do you know where he' s staying?
I have some information which might be helpful for him.
No, I have no idea.
I hope I didn' t disturb you.
- No problem.
- We' il have dinner soon, yes?
- That' d be lovely.
- Take care.
They' re expecting another shipment in today.
Bogomil...
This is a chance for me and you to blow this case wide open.
I wish I could, but I can' t.
Why?
Because Bogomil would kill me.
I' m not going to drive you to the art gallery.
It' s easy.
Jenny will let us in Maitland' s warehouse.
The shipment arrives, we nail them.
- How can you be sure it' il be drugs?
- I got a hunch.
A technique by which many crimes outside Beverly Hills get solved.
Why didn' t you tell Bogomil about this shipment?
He does everything by the book.
ls everybody in this town a robot?
This thing is very personal to me.
All he asked me to do was drive you out of town.
Now I' m going to screw that up, too.
Billy, I love you.
I just fell in love with you.
Jenny, how are you?
Jenny Summers.
- Billy' s a Beverly Hills cop.
- How do you do?
That' s Serge.
Can you get my friend an espresso?
You want it with a lemon twist?
Sure, if it' s no bother.
No, don' t be stupid.
Victor Maitland was here asking questions about you today.
He was acting real weird.
Look, I want to get back inside the warehouse.
How about I go with you?
You work in a gallery.
You' re not a cop.
lf this has to do with Mikey' s death, I want to check it out.
I don' t have time to argue with you.
Let me get my keys and we' il argue on the way.
Billy, you sit here and observe.
Don' t move till I get you.
- Why can' t I come in?
- Cos you' re a cop in this town.
Without probable cause, it' s an illegal search.
Didn' t they teach you that in cop school?
- I find some evidence, I' il get you.
- You can' t...
Be cool, all right? lf anything jumps off, I' il come and get you.
ls there any chance you' il let me go in by myself?
No chance.
Fuck.
Come on.
- Seems they' ve been already.
- What are you looking for?
This.
A crate from overseas that hasn' t passed through customs yet.
What is that?
Coffee?
Yeah, it' s coffee on top.
But this ain' t sugar.
Go get Rosewood.
Welcome to the party.
It seems we have guests.
How nice.
I do like surprises.
Jeannette.
I just can' t tell you how disappointed I am to find you here.
Shut up!
I don' t want to hear it.
Take her to the car and wait for me.
What are you going to do with him?
You should be more worried about what we' re going to do with you.
Don' t worry.
We' ve got cocaine and coffee, we' re going to have a party.
This is very nice.
Did you say something?
lf something happens to her...
I' m all ears.
I' il kill you.
Really?
That would be a neat trick.
- Well, cuz.
- Are you still pissed at me?
No.
But I should have taken care of you in Detroit.
When I popped your little buddy.
Goodbye, Mr Foley.
- Have a nice day.
- I' il try.
Damn it.
Oh, boy.
How' s that little bump on the head I gave you in Detroit?
Healed up nice, I hope.
Freeze!
Thanks.
Tell Taggart to check out the warehouse.
I' il explain later.
Sergeant Taggart is here, he wants to talk to you.
Shit!
Billy, what the hell is going on?
- Sorry, Sarge, I can' t talk now.
- What do you mean?
Just check out the warehouse and please don' t say anything to Bogomil.
- He' s not transmitting any more.
- Shit.
- What' s the matter?
- Billy' s doing something dumb again.
- Was he calling from the hotel?
- No, sir.
Right now, his car' s heading north on Palm Canyon Road.
- We were there this morning.
- What?
Foley was looking over Maitland' s house.
- Do you have that warehouse address?
- Yes, sir.
Check that place out, let me know what' s going on over there.
Don' t talk to anybody but me.
You' re under arrest.
Billy, why are you here?
- I forced him at gunpoint.
- No, he didn' t.
Everything he said about Maitland is right.
He' s kidnapped a woman.
- Let' s get her.
- What do you think I' m doing?
- We' il have a warrant in 20 minutes.
- She could be dead in 20 minutes.
Stop.
You' re coming with us.
I' m going inside.
You want to stop me, shoot me.
Me, too.
You can do what you want, but I' m going in.
This is really serious trouble.
lf you' re lucky, you' il just get fired.
- Got it.
- This is my last warning.
I' ve got to.
Shit.
Wait a minute.
- What' s that?
- Looks like East Gate.
Punch it up.
Who the hell is that?
Better get Maitland up here.
Where is everybody? ls Rosewood back?
- No, sir.
- Seen Taggart?
He took off about 10 minutes ago.
Foley' s on the grounds.
How the hell should I know?
Get some people out there right away.
Don' t take your eyes off that screen.
Try to locate Taggart and Rosewood.
Come on.
- They must be away from the car.
Keep trying.
- DD- 1 3, come in please.
- What' s their 20?
609 Palm Canyon Road.
Who lives at that address?
A Victor Maitland, sir.
- Let' s go around.
- Come on, we can do it.
Come on.
Ready, one, two... three!
You all right?
What the fuck am I doing here?
Drop it!
- Good shot, Billy.
- Let' s go.
- Jesus Christ!
- These guys are serious.
I hate machine guns.
Cover me.
Go around front.
I' m going to check the back.
609 Palm Canyon Road.
Put out a 998, officers need assistance.
- Undercovers on scene.
- Sir?
I want all north end units to roll.
South end units stay in their area.
Let' s go.
- Undercover officers at location.
Police!
You' re all under arrest!
Do that again, I' il shoot you myself.
Know what I keep thinking about?
Know the end of Butch Cassidy?
Redford and Newman are almost out of ammunition.
And the whole Bolivian army is out in front of this little hut.
I' m going to make you pay for this.
- Hanging around?
- Fuck, no.
Freeze it!
Hold it right there.
Shit!
Be careful, old boy, it might hit me.
Freeze!
Police!
You' re all under arrest!
Lay down your weapons and take two steps back with your hands up!
Very good.
Great.
What the hell' s going on here?
Shit.
- What' s this man doing here?
- Bleeding, sir.
How come he isn' t wearing cuffs?
Well, he isn' t actually in custody, sir.
Or would you like me to?
Wouldn' t you like to hear my report first, sir?
You have a report that explains all this?
Yes, sir.
Well, I will be very glad to hear it.
Miss Jeannette Summers, the manager of Mr Maitland' s art gallery, accidentally discovered what she suspected was cocaine in the gallery' s warehouse.
She immediately communicated her discovery to Detective Axel Foley.
Detective Foley was, at the time, cooperating in a joint Beverly Hills- Detroit investigation.
Detectives Foley and Rosewood proceeded to the warehouse where Rosewood discovered approximately 80 kilos of cocaine.
Rosewood called for back- up and I despatched our officers.
Believing a felony was in progress, Sergeant Taggart joined Rosewood, with Detective Foley present only as an observer, and proceeded to enter the grounds.
ln defending ourselves, we shot several suspects, including Mr Maitland.
You expect me to believe that report?
That' s the report I' m filing, sir.
Sergeant Taggart, why don' t you tell me what happened?
Happened just like the lieutenant said, Chief.
Well, I suppose congratulations are in order.
Thank you, sir.
That report better be on my desk in the morning.
First thing.
You were lying your ass off.
Go to the hospital and get your shoulder looked at.
Excuse me, sir.
Could you do me a favour, sir?
- Your favours are all used up.
- I understand.
I just hoped you could call lnspector Todd and straighten things out for me, but that' s all right.
It' s cool.
I think I' il stay in Beverly Hills.
I' m going to start a private investigation company.
I' il talk to Todd first thing.
- Really?
- You bet.
Thank you so much.
Hi, I' m Axel Foley checking out of suite 1035.
I' il get your bill.
Guys, you didn' t have to come to see me off, but I' m very moved.
Bogomil ordered us to make sure you got out of town.
That doesn' t matter.
What matters is that you came down here.
I' ve got a lump in my throat.
Look a little misty yourself, Taggart.
- There you go, sir.
- Thank you.
Excuse me, the Beverly Hills Police Department is picking that up.
Get outta here.
Guys, that' s the last straw.
You guys are too nice.
Do you sell those Beverly Palm robes?
- Yes, sir. $95 apiece.
- Put them on my tab.
I have to have two of them, though.
Billy, you saved my life.
I' il never be able to repay you, but as a token of my appreciation,
I want you to have this fine Beverly Palm robe.
Each time you get in the shower, think about our friendship.
Think about Axel Foley.
I love you, Billy.
Thanks, Axel.
Here, let me take this.
You should rest that arm.
Billy, take care of the tab.
- Taggart...
- Here you are, sir.
This is for you.
You keep it as a souvenir.
I already have three of them in my bag.
Thank you, sir.
Not going to say goodbye?
Aren' t you tailing me to the city limits?
- Yes, we are.
- I figured you would.
I was thinking about stopping for a drink.
- We figured you would.
- Then will you join me?
We' re still on duty.
I don' t think one beer' s going to kill us, Billy.
Lighten up.
One drink' s not going to kill us.
But guys, if you fall too far behind, don' t be afraid to honk, OK?
- Where we going, anyway?
- Don' t worry, just follow my lead.
You guys' il love it.
Trust me.
English
- You got a $50 bill?
- When do I get it back?
Man, give me $50!
It' s all I got.
This is part of a $50 bill like Billy' s with the hidden barcode.
Happens all the time.
No, the barcode' s going up, so it comes off this corner.
lf it comes off this corner it should have ink on it.
It' s too big to be blank.
It' s Oki- Doki!
Don' t let your brother get away.
I got to load my camera.
Oki- Doki!
Nice little kid.
Good to see you.
- I love you, Oki- Doki!
- Oki, do the Oki Shuffle.
That' s not right!
It' s like this.
Listen, I changed the steps.
You got a problem with that?
You' re supposed to be nice, no matter what!
You little motherfucker...
Oki- Doki pushed me!
You take it already.
You playing or what?
Who ate garlic?
When' s lunch?
I want a pastrami on rye.
See that move, Rufus Rabbit?
- Axel?
- What?
Would you like some coffee?
Louis, how' s it going?
- Fine, fine.
- Say hi to lrene.
- Will do.
- Louis?
Follow me.
I wouldn' t mind giving her a massage.
When DeWald took over he stuck me down here on what he calls park safety watch.
I can still access most of what' s in the mainframe.
- ls this the tunnel system?
- Yes.
Do any of these tunnels lead to somewhere only DeWald' s boys can go?
All park accesses are unrestricted to park personnel.
That' s being redone.
Show me the Happy Forest.
That would be right here at the end of corridor B.
It' s right after...
It' s right after...
- How long' s it been closed?
- Too long.
I' m talking about the Happy Forest ride?
The Forest.
Yes, about a couple of weeks.
It wasn' t very popular so they' re trying some new ideas.
I think they found one.
Can I have this?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
There you go.
You know... when this thing is over...
Would you like to get together and have some dinner or something?
- That would be nice.
- Can you put that in here?
Sure.
There you go.
- We have a date.
- A date.
Can you help me with this?
There you go.
Remember, an elephant never forgets.
All right.
- Louis, how goes it?
- Fine.
Nice to see you.
- Say hello to lrene.
- You bet.
See you.
Everything on schedule?
I had to tweak the image a little bit, but it' s under control now.
Foley' s up there.
Get him!
Will the DeWald family please come to Tiny Town?
The DeWald family to Tiny Town.
But, honey, the Happy Forest is closed.
OK, I' il meet you at the main gate at 5: 00.
- I' m sorry.
- You' re sorry?
This is Detective Axel Foley.
I' d like to speak with Agent Fulbright.
Could you patch me into his radio?
It' s an emergency.
Fulbright, Foley.
I found what you' re looking for.
I' m at Wonder World.
Get out here now!
Get me 91 1.
All cars in the vicinity of Wonder World.
10- 19, 10- 45, and 12- 22 in progress.
Why am I not surprised?
All right, don' t shoot!
I' il put my gun down.
I put my gun on the ground, and I' m unarmed.
This is great.
You caught him.
Good.
He broke into a security area.
Save that shit for new talent night at San Quentin.
- I' m on to your operation.
- My operation?
God damn it, Axel, what have you done now?
There are hundreds of children around.
- They don' t give Oscars in prison.
- Fuck you!
There' s someone here from...
Fulbright, Secret Service.
- I put you on a plane to Detroit.
- You' re gonna be glad I stayed.
It' s right here.
And what am I investigating?
That' s what was in that truck.
You wanted to follow the truck back to LA to find his print shop.
- It' s right here in Wonder World.
- What is he raving on about?
He' s proved that.
- ln Wonder World?
This place is as high- tech as NASA and Nintendo combined.
I was in there.
That' s why they were chasing me.
My men were pursuing Mr Foley because he' s delusionary and potentially dangerous.
This room, delusionary also?
There is a closed ride, which we use to...
- I' d better take a look at it.
- Maybe we' d better look at it.
Counterfeit bills, out of this machine.
- ls this true?
- 'Fraid so, officer.
'Fraid we' ve been caught red- handed, right, Ellis?
'Fraid so.
Would you like to see them?
Make a run, Donald.
We call them Wonder World dollars.
Redeemable for admission, rides, souvenirs.
It' s our big Christmas promotion.
We' re giving it away to elementary schools across the country.
You must be in on this.
You supply equipment, he supplies paper, right?
They changed it to this shit after I left.
- After we leave they' il put it back.
- What' s this paper?
- Ordinary rag.
- They switched it.
I am tired of these accusations, officers.
I want this man arrested for public endangerment.
Could I speak with you a moment?
God damn it, we spent a fucking year with our noses up DeWald' s ass!
We' re this close to locking this up, and you piss all over us!
Our case is blown.
You' re going back to Detroit, and if you weren' t a cop,
I' d have you doing dead time in Leavenworth for life.
Detective Flint, he' s yours.
Let' s go, Axel.
Make sure he doesn' t get on the plane.
I got a wife, three kids, a mortgage and a pension that won' t cut it.
That job at Wonder World is my retirement plan.
We' re being followed.
It' s the security guards at Wonder World.
They probably want to make sure you get on that plane.
Because of you, my future is in real fucking jeopardy.
DeWald is pissed.
Sanderson won' t think too highly of me.
Hold up!
Stop the car!
- That liquor store.
Stop!
- What?
- Oh, shit!
- Wait!
It' s all right.
I' il get him.
When I do, I' il kill him!
Axel, I left as soon as I got your call.
Are you OK?
I' m fine, but I want you to think back to the night Fry disappeared.
- No.
Why would you think that?
Because this note by itself... it just don' t make no sense.
"This is important.
Life and death. "
Why would he even send that?
Not "help, I need to talk to you," nothing.
Just this.
Oh, shit.
He knew they' d kill him so he sent it to you.
- There' s a barcode.
- What does that mean?
It used to belong to Uncle Sam.
We can put Sanderson and DeWald' s ass in jail.
I don' t think so.
I figured you' d call Uncle Dave here, so we followed him.
I actually was a real cop once so I know how you assholes think, which is to say, slowly.
Very slowly.
So you were carrying the evidence the whole time, Sherlock?
Here' s the real ending of the story.
Let' s see if you like it.
You had a grudge against the park.
I feared you might try to harm our beloved Uncle Dave, so I raced over here as fast as I could to try and stop you, but alas, it was too late.
Get him all the way in the car.
Take it.
You worried about fingerprints?
Look at the gun.
It' s yours.
Give me your weapon.
Throw that gun in the street!
Close the door and get over there!
Damn it!
Don' t you die on me, man.
Come on!
That was Uncle Dave.
- Pressure?
- 90 over 40 and dropping.
Let' s go, guys.
Let' s go.
On three.
One, two, three.
Any medical history?
I' ve been shot before, but it' s no big deal.
- Where' s the coffee machine?
- Down the hall.
This is an all- city alert for a suspect in the Thornton shooting.
Suspect is an African- American male...
- No?
- Come on, let' s get out of here.
Somebody shot Dave Thornton.
- Somebody shot Uncle Dave?
- ls there a TV here?
Yes, of course.
Authorities believe that Foley attacked Uncle Dave in retaliation for some personal rejection.
According to hospital sources, the prognosis is bleak.
How does a psycho like that live with himself?
Janice, Axel.
Get out of the park.
They' re going to kill whoever knows about Roger Fry' s note.
Janice can' t come to the phone right now.
Can I take a message?
- lf you do anything...
- It' il be your fault.
I want you at Wonder World within the hour.
Come to the main gate alone and unarmed.
- And bring the Mint paper.
- Then you let us go?
lf you don' t show up here in a half- hour, alone, unarmed and with no cops, I kill your friend.
And it wouldn' t be the first time, would it?
We have an amateur video of the incident this afternoon involving Uncle Dave' s assassin, Axel Foley.
All right, don' t shoot.
I' m putting my gun down.
I' m putting it on the ground.
Don' t shoot.
That was an amateur video shot earlier today by a tourist.
Would you please take special care of my car?
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
- Shit!
- Ackwell...
Serge, I need a weapon.
I don' t have any weapon.
I take all back.
- What about this?
- This is the floor model.
People been breathing on it, coughing on it...
Serge, I need a weapon now.
Donny, Ackwell in some kind of rush, OK?
So take the Annihilator and wash it off with some cologne, and take the case and make sure it' s nice and pretty.
It' s Corinthian leather.
- Axel, listen.
Am I your friend?
I' m sure you can explain, or maybe you can' t explain, but you' ve got to turn yourself in.
- No!
Axel!
Put your arms out and hold for a pat- down.
Foley just arrived, sir.
We have Foley.
Come on.
- How much do you want run?
- All of it.
- Are you OK?
- Let' s have the paper.
There' s a phone inside.
When she calls, I' il give you it.
- I don' t think so.
- Then we got a stalemate.
Not quite.
Orrin...
The paper don' t mean jack shit.
How you know I didn' t mail it to the Secret Service?
- He' s bluffing.
Call me.
Orrin, I know how cops think.
The note is in the car.
The keys, Foley.
Give me the fucking keys.
- Drop that fucking gun!
- Again?
Drop it!
Axel, what are you doing here?
- What happened?
- It' s the coolant safety system.
Protects the mainframe in case of fire.
- We can' t.
Not from this side.
He' s trying to use an outside line.
Do something!
Hello, police?
Shit!
Foley' s loose in the park!
I repeat...
Get him!
Mr DeWald!
Call for help!
There' s just the modem line for the computers.
I got it!
Just let the computer dial...
What good would that be?
A lot of good.
We can call Flint' s pager.
Foley is in Hometown Square.
Repeat, Foley is in Hometown Square.
Foley is heading for Alien Attack.
This is a red alert.
Aliens are invading the city.
Board the subway trains for immediate evacuation.
He ran up those stairs.
I need that right away!
Not again.
Excuse me.
Dispatch, this is Flint.
Trace that number that keeps calling me.
555- 4085.
It' s a computer line at the Wonder World theme park.
Call and tell them their computer' s broken.
We tried, but all the voice lines are down.
Must be that Uncle Dave shooting.
Somebody shot Uncle Dave?
- Some fool named Axel Foley.
Where the fuck is he?
Get to a phone and call the police.
I' il try and find Axel.
All right!
There you are.
Foley' s...
Name' s Wild Bill Rosewood.
I' m the sheriff of this town.
What the hell happened here?
Shit!
Damn it!
Turn that fucking song off!
Foley?
You all right?
- Hello, Fulbright.
- You hurt bad?
Look, Foley, I guess I owe you an apology.
You were right.
I got Sanderson handcuffed in the car.
He was in on it, right?
I found out about another partner that was in on it.
So long, Foley.
You OK?
Any chance you can explain any of this to me?
Like why the fuck am I shot?
You guys OK?
- Are you OK?
- I' m fine.
I wonder what time the park opens.
He needs medical attention.
- Does this hurt?
- Don' t touch it.
I am so happy to introduce to you our new character in Wonder World, named after a man who' s most responsible for my being here today.
Axel Fox!
I don' t think you' ve seen the Tunnel of Love ride, have you?
I didn' t know y' all had a Tunnel of Love ride in Wonder World.
There will be shortly.
ENGLlSH
60 knots?
No way, Barnes.
The Reds don' t have anything that fast.
Checked it twice.
I mean, it' s a real unique signature.
No cavitation.
No reactor noise.
It doesn' t even sound like screws.
What the hell is it?
I' il tell you what it' s not.
It' s not one of ours.
Sir, contact changing to heading 214.
Speed, 80 knots.
80 knots.
Still diving.
Depth 900 feet.
Still diving.
Depth 900 feet.
Port clearance 150 feet from the cliff wall, sir.
It' s getting tight in here.
We can still give him a haircut.
Helm, come right to... 069.
Down five degrees.
Coming right 069.
Down five degrees.
Aye.
Narrowing 75.
Sir, we have a proximity warning light.
It' s too damn close!
We gotta back off.
Sir, range to contact 200.
Contact justjinked to bearing 260 and accelerated to... to 130 knots, sir.
Nothin 'goes 130.
Sir, range to contact 100 yards.
80 yards, sir!
60!
It' s turbulence!
We' re in its wake!
Helm, all stop!
Full right rudder.
Hydraulic failure.
Planes not responding, sir.
Auxiliary power.
Monitors back.
Hydraulics restored, sir.
Oh, my God!
Fire in sonar!
Collision alarm!
Fire control to sonar!
Let' s get outta here!
- Lighten her up, Charlie!
- Port torpedo room is flooded, sir!
Blow all tanks!
Blow everything!
All back full!
Answering, all back full!
Give me a damage report!
What' s our depth?
Passing 1400, sir.
Main forward tanks are ruptured!
Still descending, sir!
1450.
Passing 1500, sir.
Still descending.
- We' re too deep to pump auxiliaries.
- Passing 1550.
Still descending.
- We' re losin 'her!
- Passing 1600, sir,
- and still descending!
- Launch the buoy.
Passing 1650.
- Passing 1700, sir.
- Launching!
Come on!
Give me your hand!
Get the door closed!
Benthic Explorer, Salvor One on final.
Over.
Copy you, Salvor One.
This is Benthic Explorer.
You' re cleared to land.
Hey!
They' re coming.
This... could get pretty ugly.
Yeah.
Does not look good at all.
Oh, no.
Look who' s with them.
The queen bitch of the universe.
Sonny, how you doin '?
I' ve got two more welds on this bypass valve.
No light from the surface.
- How deep are they?
- McBride?
1700 feet.
- I need them to go below 2, 000.
- No problem.
They can do that.
So that' s it?
You just cheerfully turn the whole thing over to the goon squad?
Look, I was told to cooperate.
I' m cooperating.
Kirkhill, you' re pathetic.
Get Brigman on the line.
Deepcore, this is Benthic.
Man, if Bud goes along with this, they' re gonna have to shoot her with a tranquilliser gun.
- Roger.
- Hippy, get me Bud.
Catfish, get them old bones up here and give me a hand.
Hang on.
I' il be up there in a second.
Hey, you guys are milkin 'that job.
Yeah, it' s just because we love freezing our butts off out here for you so much.
Bring me another hammer!
- Hey, Bud!
- Yeah!
Hippy' s on the bitch box!
It' s a call from topside.
That new company man.
- Kirkhill?
- Yeah.
That guy don' t know his butt from a rathole.
Perry, square away this mud hose and get rid of some of these empty sacks.
- It' s starting to look like my apartment.
- You got it, boss!
- Bud, pick up the topside line.
Urgent.
- I' m coming!
I' m coming!
Jesus!
Keep your pantyhose on!
Brigman here.
Yeah, Kirkhill.
What' s goin 'on?
Yeah, I' m calm.
I' m a calm person.
Is there some reason why I shouldn' t be calm?
What?
I am on last feed now.
Can you get that goddamn hippy shit music off the comm line, please?
I' m almost done with the shut- off valve.
Sonny, I' m right behind you with the next fitting.
Hang on a second.
- OK, give it to me.
- Here you go.
Thanks, sweetie.
All divers, drop what you' re doin '.
Everybody out of the pool.
I mean everybody right now.
Sonny, One Night, let' s go.
Damn it.
We just got out here.
There was a time when I woulda asked why.
- Get a move on!
- Shit, woman!
Deepcore, Deepcore.
This is Flatbed preparing to surface.
Roger, Flatbed.
Come on up.
All rig personnel assemble at the moon pool.
Everybody get to sub- bay.
Come on.
Let' s get his hat off.
- Take it off.
- What the hell' s goin 'on?
- How come we got recalled?
- The hell if I know.
I got it.
- What' s the drift, pardner?
- Just follow standard procedure.
Flog your dog till somebody tells you what' s happenin '.
- What' s the story, boss?
- Folks, listen up!
We just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
- Oh, shit!
- What?
We' ve received an invitation to, um, cooperate in a matter of national security.
Now you know as much as I do.
Get your gear off and get to control.
We' ve got a briefing in ten minutes.
Come on!
Let' s move it!
At 0922 local time today an American nuclear submarine, the USS Montana, with 156 men aboard, went down - about 22 miles from here.
There' s been no contact with the sub since then.
The cause of the incident is not known.
Your company has authorised the navy' s use of this facility for a rescue operation code- named Operation Salvor.
- You want us to search for the sub?
- No.
We know where it is.
But she' s in 2, 000 feet of water and we can' t reach her.
We need divers to enter the sub and search for survivors... if any.
Don' t you have your own stuff for this?
By the time we get our submersibles here, the storm' il be on us.
You can get your rig in and be on site in 15 hours.
That makes you our best option.
Why should we risk our butts for something like this?
I have been authorised to offer you all special bonuses equivalent to three times normal dive pay.
Yes, sir, buddy!
For triple time, I' d eat Beany!
Set me on fire and put me out with horse piss.
I don' t know what kind of deal you made with the company, but my people are not qualified for this.
We' re oil workers.
Shut up!
Hold it down.
This is Lieutenant Coffey.
He will transfer down to you with a SEAL team and supervise the operation.
Send down whoever you like, but I' m the tool pusher on this rig.
When it comes to the safety of these people, there' s me and then God.
Understand?
I' m pulling the plug.
I think we' re all on the same wavelength, Brigman.
Now, let' s get the wellhead uncoupled, shall we?
Let' s take it about five degrees left, all right?
Roger.
Five degrees left, Bud.
Plot these numbers to our position.
I need to know when the leading edge will hit.
Well, it' s official.
They' re calling it Hurricane Frederick.
And it' s gonna be making our lives
- real interesting in a few hours.
- Fred?
I don' t know, man.
I think hurricanes should be named after women, don' t you?
- I can' t believe you' re letting them do this.
- Hi, Lins!
I thought you were in Houston.
I was.
Now I' m here.
- Only here isn' t where I left it, is it, Bud?
- Wasn' t up to me.
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.
- I can' t believe you let them grab my rig!
- Your rig?
- I designed the damn thing.
- Benthic Petroleum paid for it.
So as long as they' re holding the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
I had a lot riding on this.
They bought you, didn' t they?
More like rented you cheap!
I' m switchin 'off now.
Bye- bye.
Oh, OK.
Virgil, you wiener!
You never could stand up to a fight!
Bye- bye.
Virgil?
God, I hate that bitch!
Probably shouldn' t have married her, then, huh?
Get it stable!
Cab 3.
You' re clear to launch.
Hang on, gentlemen.
Touchdown!
Crowd goes wild!
Explorer, this is Cab 3.
We are styling.
- How you boys doin 'back there?
- Great.
Explorer, this is Cab 3.
Starting our descent along the umbilical.
- Roger that, Cab 3.
Good luck.
- Luck is not a factor.
- Hey, One Night.
How you doin '?
- I got a white line fever, baby.
Yeah, I heard that.
Deepcore, Deepcore.
- This is Cab 3 on final approach.
- Roger, Cab 3.
Is that you, Lindsey?
None other.
Oh, no!
Howdy, boys!
Hey, Lindsey!
I' il be damned!
Y' all shouldn' t be down here, sweet thing.
You might ruin your stockings.
The bad news is we got eight hours in this can blowin 'down.
And the worse news is it' s gonna take us three weeks
- to decompress later.
- We' ve all been fully briefed, Mrs Brigman.
Just don' t call me that, OK?
I hate that.
All right.
What would you like us to call you?
Sir?
There we go!
Y' all start equalisin '... now!
Let' s watch each other closely for signs of HPNS.
High pressure nervous syndrome.
Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.
- Nausea, excitability...
- Disorientation.
And a partridge in a pear tree.
About one person in 20 can' t handle it.
They just go buggo.
Look, they' ve all made runs to this depth.
- They checked out.
- I understand that.
What I' m saying is it' s impossible to predict
- just who' s susceptible.
- They checked out.
- These guys the SEALs?
- Yeah.
Those guys ain' t so tough.
I' ve fought guys plenty tougher than them.
Now we get to hear how you could have been a contender?
Hey!
- You see this?
- Yeah.
They used to call this the hammer.
Y' all done to a turn and ready to serve.
Everybody OK?
- They' re really very sweet.
- Yeah.
Hey!
I don' t remember putting a wall here.
How you doin ', Jammer?
- Pretty good.
How are you, little lady?
- I' m OK.
I want a full check on their gear.
These guys are about as much fun as a tax audit.
Hippy, you' re gonna give that rat a disease.
Hi, Lins!
Well, well.
Mrs Brigman.
Not for long.
You never did like being called that, did you?
Not even when it meant something.
- Is that One Night in Flatbed?
- Yeah.
Who else?
Here.
Say hi.
- Hey, One Night.
It' s Lindsey.
- Oh, hi, Lindsey.
Obstacle- avoidance is showin' a rise out about 100m.
What do you wanna do?
I can' t believe you were dumb enough to come down here.
Now you' re stuck here for the storm.
- That was dumb, hot rod.
- I didn' t come down here to fight with you.
Yeah, well...
Then why did you come down?
You need me.
Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.
Once you' re disconnected, you guys are on your own for however long this storm lasts.
What if something was to happen after the surface support clears off?
Wow, you' re right.
Us poor dumb old boys might' ve had to think for ourselves.
It could' ve been a disaster.
- You wanna know what I think?
Look where this thing is set.
- You wanna know what I think?
- Not particularly.
- I think you were worried about me.
- Then that must be it.
No, seriously.
I think you were.
Come on.
It' s OK.
It' s OK.
You can admit it.
I was worried... about the rig.
I' ve got over four years invested in this project.
Yeah.
You only had three years invested in me.
Well, you have to have priorities.
It' s kinda messy, but I guarantee you it' s the only bunk that won' t be occupied.
You can get a couple of hours' rest before we get there.
What are you still wearing that for?
I don' t know.
Divorce ain' t final.
Forgot to take it off.
I haven' t worn mine in months.
Yeah.
Well, whatshisname wouldn' t like it.
The suit.
Do you always have to call him that?
The suit.
Makes you sound like such a hick.
His name is Michael.
How is Michael, then?
Mr Brooks Brothers.
Mr BMW.
You still seeing him?
No.
No, I haven' t seen him in a few weeks.
Terribly sorry.
What happened?
Why are you doing this?
This is none of your business!
It' s not a part of your life any more.
I' il tell you what happened.
You woke up one morning in those satin sheets, rolled over, and there was this good- looking guy.
Well- groomed, expensive watch on.
And you realised "This guy never makes me laugh."
That' s it, Bud.
That' s it!
Aren' t you clever?
Jesus!
You' re clever!
You should start your own talk show!
Ask Dr Bud.
Advice to the lovelorn from 300 fathoms.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, shit!
- Cuttin' you loose, Bud.
- OK, One Night.
Stay clear.
We' re setting her down.
Touchdown!
This is us, sitting right on the edge of the Cayman Trough.
This is the Montana.
300m away, 70m below us.
We think she slid down the wall and now sits here on this outcropping.
So we' re gonna have to drop straight down... here and...
This tell us how much radiation we' re gettin '?
Whoa!
I' m not going near no radiation!
No way!
- Hippy, you pussy.
- What good is the money, six months later your dick drops off?
We' il take readings as we go.
If the reactor' s breached, the warheads have released any radioactive debris, we' il just back off.
- It' s that simple.
- OK.
OK.
Hippy' s not going, so, McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
Goddamn it!
You know McWhirter can' t run an ROV worth shit!
Then you' d better go.
I' il go.
What is your problem?
On this dive you' il do absolutely nothing without direct orders from me.
And you' il follow those orders without discussion.
Is that clear?
I want everyone ready to get wet in 15 minutes.
- Gimme a hand loading Little Geek.
- Let' s get suited up.
Hey, guys!
Hold it a second.
Hold it!
Whoa!
Look...... it' s 3am.
Maybe you could cut them some slack.
- I can' t afford slack.
- You come on my rig, you don' t talk to me, and you start ordering my people around.
It' s not gonna work.
You gotta know how to handle these people.
We got a certain way of doing things here.
I' m not interested in your way of doing things.
Just get your team ready to dive.
These guys have got no sense of humour.
Bud, do you know your hand is blue?
Finler, why don' t you just shut up and put your gear on?
Keep it coming.
Hippy, throw me one of them cyalumes, please.
- Good.
- Excuse me.
- What is all this stuff?
- Fluid breathing system.
We just got them.
- You use it when you go really deep.
- How deep?
- Deep.
- How deep?
It' s classified.
You breathe liquid so you can' t get compressed.
- The pressure doesn' t get you.
- You mean you got liquid in your lungs?
- emulsion.
- Bullshit!
Check this out.
- Can I borrow your rat?
- What are you doin '?
You' re gonna...
You' re gonna kill her!
- It' s OK.
- Man!
You' re just drowning her?
He' s gonna be fine.
I' ve breathed this myself.
- It' s gonna be fine.
- No, man.
She' s gonna drown!
- She' s freaking out!
- It' s a normal adjustment period.
Does this look normal to you?
She' s gonna drown!
He' s taking the fluid into his lungs.
He' s taking the fluid into his lungs.
There he goes.
Still has a bit of anxiety here.
Now he' s starting to relax.
See his chest moving?
- He' s getting plenty of oxygen.
- Damn rat' s breathing that shit.
That is, no bullshit, hands down, the goddamnedest thing I ever saw.
The fluid' s harder to push in and out than air.
It' s a little more work to breathe.
But he' s doing fine.
He' s diggin 'it.
She' s doin 'it.
She ain' t diggin 'it.
All right, let her out now!
- Now!
- OK.
All right.
OK.
Now we let the fluid drain from his lungs.
All right.
Give her here.
Here' s your rat.
- See?
He' s fine!
- It' s a she.
Going over the wall.
Coming to bearing 065.
Flatbed, you on line?
Ten- four, Lindsey.
We read you loud and clear.
Starting our descent.
Divers, how you doin '?
Everybody' s OK so far.
Hang on, boys.
It' s all downhill from here.
- Hey, how deep' s the drop- off here?
- This here' s the bottomless pit, baby.
Two and a half miles straight down.
Cab 3, it' s Bud.
You on line?
Cab 3 check.
I' m right behind you.
Cab 1, do you see it yet?
Magnetometer' s twitching, but I don' t see anything yet.
Hang on.
I' m gonna test my strobes.
Cab 1, do you have a visual?
- Cab 1, do you copy?
- Yeah.
Roger that.
Found it.
Cab 1, radiation readings?
Neutron counter' s not showing much.
All right.
Just continue forward along the hull.
Copy that.
Continuing forward.
You want me to get shots of everything, yes?
Roger that.
Document as much as you can.
But, please, keep moving.
Remember, we' re on a tight time line.
Copy that.
Coming up to the midships hatch.
Do you see it, Cab 3?
Yeah, roger.
I got it.
- How do you want me?
- Just hold above it.
- Roger.
- OK.
It' s all yours, Lieutenant.
- All right, A Team.
- Let' s do it.
OK.
Perry, Hippy.
- Let' s get that ROVlaunched.
- OK.
We' re on it, boss.
Go!
Little Geek is on the case.
Monk here, sir.
We got the midships outer hatch open.
Entering escape trunk.
Inner hatch looks intact.
All right.
I' m gonna open her up.
OK.
Get in there.
- Roger.
Somebody get on that tether.
- Got it.
Sorry about this, little buddy, but better you than me.
You know what I mean?
Coffey, these are the missile hatches, right?
That' s right.
It looks like a couple of the hatches have sprung.
Radiation' s nominal.
Warheads must still be intact.
How many are there?
24 Trident missiles.
Eight MlRVs per missile.
That' s 192 warheads, Coffey.
How powerful are they?
Your MlRVis a tactical nuke.
50 kilotons nominal yield.
Say... five times Hiroshima.
Jesus Christ!
It' s World War ill in a can.
Let' s knock off the chatter.
OK.
I' m headin 'into the reactor compartment.
- Getting a reading?
- It' s twitching.
But it' s below the line you said was safe.
All right.
Let' s get in there.
Flatbed, drop down starboard of the sail and stay along the cliff edge.
OK.
Copy that.
Keep heading for the bow.
OK, Flatbed.
This looks good.
Just set it down here.
- We' re solid.
- Let' s go.
All right.
Let' s go.
OK.
Let' s just take it slow and easy goin' in.
Don' t take any chances.
Where are we, Coffey?
This is the forward berthing compartment.
This way.
- You guys OK?
Cat?
Jammer?
- Right behind you, Bud.
Check your gauges.
How' s your O2?
- I' m OK.
- Yeah, gauges are good.
OK.
16 minutes to go.
Jammer here.
CO2 is up.
- Breathe slower, buddy.
- OK.
Come on.
Let' s keep up.
All right.
Up this way to the control centre.
It' s jammed!
Gimme a hand!
Get up here with that pry bar.
It' s moving.
Pull!
Jesus!
All right!
We knew we were gonna see this.
Just move on.
- Jesus!
- Come on, Jammer.
Let' s go.
OK.
Let' s stay cool.
Everybody stay cool.
We can' t help these guys, but we might find somebody further in.
Stay here.
Hey, Jammer.
You OK?
- How you guys doin '?
- I' m dealin '.
Triple time sounded like a lot of money, Bud.
It ain' t.
We' re here.
Let' s get it done, OK?
Brigman, take your men and continue aft.
Split up into two teams.
Come on.
Let' s get moving.
We head back in 14 minutes.
Let' s go.
You OK, Jammer?
Yeah, I' m fine.
- What' s this?
- Should be the missile launch control centre.
- Don' t touch anything.
This way.
I' m right behind you.
- Still with me, Jammer?
- Where are we?
Missile compartment.
Those are the launch tubes.
Shit!
Hey, Jammer.
Hey!
Hey!
You OK?
Deep and slow, big guy.
- Deep and slow.
Just breathe easy.
- Everybody' s dead!
- They' re all dead!
I' m taking you back out.
Let' s go.
I' m OK.
I just can' t go any further in.
OK, Jammer.
No problem.
You stay right here.
I' ve gotta check out this compartment, all right?
We' il stay in voice contact.
You hold onto the end of this rope here.
You have any problem whatsoever, you tug twice.
- I got it.
- Pull it hard.
Five more minutes.
Just relax, all right?
You' il be OK.
- It' s OK.
- Be right back.
You still readin' me OK, big guy?
Read you fine, Bud.
OK.
Just a few more minutes.
There' s a couple of compartments up ahead that might have air.
- OK.
No problem.
- We gotta be sure, right?
Hang on, Jammer.
Just hold onto that...
Shit!
Bud?
Can you hear me?
Bud?
Goddamn it!
Oh, Jesus!
Bud, is that you?
Hang on, Jammer.
Lew!
Cat!
Hurry up, on the double!
I' m on my way!
Jammer!
- What' s the problem?
- He' s convulsing!
It' s his mixture!
Too much oxygen!
Gotta get the O2 cut down!
Turn him over!
Crank it down, man!
You' re losing him!
All right.
We' ve gotta get him outta here!
Let' s go.
Let' s move it.
Easy, big fella.
One Night, do you see the divers?
- Are they out yet?
- Negative, Lindsey.
Haven' t seen hide nor hair.
Let' s give 'em two minutes more max and then I' il sound the diver recall...
Lindsey, do you copy?
Meet me at Flatbed!
This is a diver emergency!
- Lins, do you copy!
- Yeah, copy you, Bud.
I' m on my way.
Look, I' m just a medic.
Which is mostly about patching holes.
This type of thing, it' s...
There' s not much I can do.
The coma could last hours or days.
So you didn' t get anything on the cameras?
No, I didn' t get a picture of it.
- What about the video?
- No.
We lost power right then.
Look, I just don' t wanna talk about this, OK?
Be that way.
Look, I don' t know what I saw, Bud, OK?
Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible- fine.
It' s a Russian submersible.
No problem.
Yeah, but you think it was something else.
What?
One of ours?
No.
Well, whose then?
Come on, Lindsey.
Talk to me.
Look, Jammer saw something down there.
- Something that scared the hell out of him.
- His mixture got screwed up.
Jammer panicked.
He pranged his regulator and his mixture got screwed up.
But what did he see that made him panic?
Well, what do you think he saw?
I don' t know.
- Did any of you see it?
- No, sir.
The Brigman woman saw it.
Could have been a Russian bogey.
ClNCLANTFLT' s gonna go apeshit.
Two Russian attack subs, a Tango and a Victor, were tracked to within 50 miles of here.
And now they don' t know where the hell they are.
OK.
I don' t have any choice.
I' m confirming you to go to Phase Two.
You' il recover one warhead, arm it, and wait for further instructions.
- Have we got a problem with that?
- Negative, sir.
Come on!
- What' d he say?
- Turn it up, bozo!... early reports that the Montana encountered a Soviet fast attack sub prior to its sinking and the Kremlin continues to deny any involvement.
That' s us!
That' s us, man!
Benthic Petroleum are participating in the recovery operation, but we have little information.
We want names!
Hey, that' s the Explorer!
We' re famous!
There is a tremendous amount of activity.
With Cuba only 80 miles away, the massive build- up of American forces has drawn official protest from Havana and Moscow.
Russian and Cuban trawlers, undoubtedly surveillance vessels, have been circling the area
- and Soviet aircraft have been warned away.
- This sucks!
- Hippy, what' s the matter with you?
- What' s the matter with me?
Nothing!
We' re in the middle of some international incident
- like the Cuban Missile Crisis!
- Figured that out for yourself, Hip?
We got Russian subs creeping around.
Anything goes wrong, they could say whatever they want happened.
Relax, will you?
You' re making the women nervous.
- Cute, Virgil.
- You know, those SEALs ain' t tellin 'us diddly.
Something is goin 'on!
- Come on, come on.
- Hippy, you think everything' s a conspiracy.
Everything is.
Coffey' s splitting with Flatbed!
I showed him how to work the controls and they' re outta here!
- Didn' t you tell him we need it?
- Yeah!
- Where the hell is he takin 'it?
- I have no idea!
Shit!
Coffey!
Come back!
We need the big arm to unhook the umbilical.
There' s a goddamn hurricane coming!
- He switched off.
- It' s unbelievable.
Go back down and tell those men to get below and stay there!
We need to get unhooked and get out of here now!
- All right.
Do it, then.
- No problem, except your boys went sightseeing with Flatbed.
My people need Flatbed to get unhooked at their end.
- Back in two hours.
- Two hours?!
We' re gonna get the shit kicked out of us by our pal Fred in two hours!
OK.
Set cold tab fitting to 200psi.
- Set.
- There she goes.
- She' s breakin' loose.
- Bringin' her up.
OK.
All right.
Clear the hatch.
Go on with it.
Go on.
That' s it.
Up.
Sir, the missile looks intact.
Little is known about the events leading up to the collision.
The US Navy guided missile cruiser Appleton apparently struck the Soviet Udaloy class destroyer in low visibility conditions.
In violent seas, little hope remains for over 100 Russian crewmen, still missing after the sinking an hour ago.
Soviet military spokesmen have claimed that the collision constituted an unprovoked attack.
- This was denied by...
- Bud, this is big time.... who said that Captain Michael Sweeney...
- OK.
It' s clear.
- It' s all yours, sir.
I' m gonna swing it away and drop it.
Check.
OK.
Bypass the ground connection on the separation sequencer.
- Got it?
- Separation sequencer disconnected.
Remove explosive bolts one through six
- in counterclockwise sequence.
- Check.
Removing bolt one.
Negotiators have walked out of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in protest over the incident this morning.
The deterioration of relations with the United States...
Soviet build- up of tanks and aircraft has continued.... this morning, all US and NATO military forces have been put on full alert.
It' s on every channel.
Well, you just feel so helpless.
You can see it coming, but what can you do?
What can anyone do?
Hey, I mean, they love their kids too.
So why are we doing this?
If it happens, it happens.
There' s nothing I can do about it, right?
I just don' t think about it.
Then clear the sub!
Come on, let' s go!
Let' s move it!
One Night, you' re up!
Get ready to roll, baby!
- Don' t touch that!
Just back away.
- Excusez- moi!
Hey, Coffey.
We' re a little pressed for time.
Prick.
This ain' t no drill, Slick.
Make me proud.
Piece of cake, baby.
What' s the problem, One Night?
All hell must be breaking loose up there.
This cable' s pissin' me off!
- I can' t get a grip on it.
Just keep tryin '.
Son of a bitch!
Shit!
We got a problem!
- What' s going on?
- We' re losing number two thruster!
Bearing' s going!
It' s not holding!
We' re swinging out of position here!
Jesus!
Shit!
The rig is movin '!
Yeah, I can see that.
Topside!
Pay out some slack!
We' re gettin 'dragged!
Down on number one winch!
Down on one!
We' re headed for the drop- off!
What the hell...?
We just lost all the topside feeds!
Shit!
Get 'em on the UQC.
- Any damage on the hull?
- Bud!
- We lost the crane!
- Say again.
What?
The crane!
We' ve lost the crane!
It' s on its way down to you!
All right, everybody!
Everybody rig for impact!
Close all the exterior hatches!
Let' s move it!
Go!
- Wait!
- Get in here!
- What the hell is goin 'on around here?!
- I don' t know!
You two help secure the rig!
Let' s go!
One Night!
Get the hell outta there!
The crane' s comin 'down!
I' m OK.
I' m clear, Bud.
I' ve got it!
It' s headed straight for us!
Oh, shit!
- Oh, God...
- No!
Bud?
Grab onto something!
Jesus!
Let' s go!
- Cat, put that out!
- Bud!
The drill room' s floodin '!
- Get back down there!
Go!
I' il take the battery room!
Jesus!
Shit!
- Get out of there!
- Close the door!
Seal the room!
Lindsey!
Let' s get outta here!
- Hold this on me!
- OK!
Lindsey!
I got it!
Let' s get the hell outta here!
Let' s go!
Hit the door!
No!
Bud!
Finler, cut the hose!
Cut the line to the motor!
I can' t open it from out here!
Finler, cut the hose!
Finler!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Come on, Sonny!
- Hey, Cat!
Cat, help me out, man!
Hang on!
The hose!
Cut the hose!
The line to the motor!
Hurry up, man!
Come on, Cat!
Hurry!
Come on, Sonny!
Help me out!
Come on!
Push!
- Come on, Sonny!
Let' s go!
- Come on!
Let' s go!
We gotta go!
Get outta here!
Come on!
Move it!
Go!
Get the hatch, Cat!
Get the hatch!
- You all right?
Everybody OK?
- Yeah.
Son of a bitch!
Oh, man!
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.
This is Deepcore Two.
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.
This is Deepcore.
Do you read me?
Over.
Forget it, Sonny.
They' re gone, man.
- Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
- Hey.
They' re gone.
OK?
I just wanna get out of this.
I' d just like to see my wife one more time.
Well, all right, then.
You' d better keep trying, huh?
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
This is Deepcore Two.
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.
This is Deepcore Two.
Over.
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
Hey, Jammer.
- You got the shakes.
- I know what I got.
I' il deal with it, all right?
I' il deal with me.
You deal with yourself.
Find your buddy?
- No.
- Tighter.
- Brigman.
- What?
I was under orders.
I had no choice.
How' s it going, Cat?
- What' s the scoop, ace?
I can get power to this module and sub- bay if I reroute these buses.
But I gotta get past the mains, which are a total meltdown.
But there won' t be enough to run the heaters.
In a few hours, this place is gonna be as cold as a meat locker.
- What about O2?
- Yeah, well, brace yourself.
If we close off the sections we' re not using, we have about maybe 12 hours' worth.
The storm' s gonna last a lot longer than 12 hours.
Yeah, well...
I can maybe extend that.
Maybe.
There are some storage tanks outboard next to the wrecked module.
I' il have to go outside, though, and tie onto them.
Hey, Lins.
- Lins.
- Yeah?
I' m glad you' re here.
Yeah?
I' m not.
Hey.
Found Cab 3.
Deader than dogshit, boss.
That girder went right through the brainpan.
Yeah, I see that.
- Where are you?
- Living quarters.
Level two.
Jeez!
That' s Perry.
That' s it, then.
Finler, McWhirter, Dietz and Perry.
Jesus.
We just leave 'em there?
Yeah, for now.
We got no choice.
Our first priority is to get somethin 'to breathe.
Where are you now, Lins?
I' m under the starboard tri- module.
- Still with me, Hip?
- Right behind you, Lins.
- How' s it look?
- Well, you guys really screwed up my rig.
- There' s a lot of wreckage out here.
- Well, don' t get fouled.
- Hit me with that nine sixteenths, OK?
- Yeah.
Thank you.
So...
- There you were.
- Yeah, there we were.
Side by side on the same ship for two months.
I' m a tool pusher and we' re testing this automated derrick of hers.
We get back on the beach and we' re livin 'together.
Doesn' t mean you had to marry her.
Well, we were due to go back out on the same ship.
Six months of tests.
If you were married, you got a stateroom.
Otherwise it was bunks.
OK.
Good reason.
Will you come over here and tighten this for me?
Then what?
Then it was all right there for a while, you know.
Then she got promoted to chief engineer on this thing.
- She went front office on you, man.
- Yeah, well, you know Lindsey.
She' s just too damn aggressive.
Son of a bitch!
She didn' t leave me.
She just left me behind.
Bud, let me tell you somethin '.
She ain' t half as smart as she thinks she is.
Get outta here.
Come on.
Let' s see those muscles.
Bingo!
That' s one.
Two for two.
Hey, hey.
Lindsey, do you read me?
Over.
Copy you, Hippy.
What' s the matter?
Oh, shit.
The power' s jackin 'around with us again.
Lindsey, come back.
I just lost video.
Lins, are you there...?
Hippy, do you copy?
Lins, you copy?
Oh, shit!
Oh, what the hell!
Hippy, do you copy?
Damn it!
Bud, do you copy?
Over.
I seem to be having a problem here.
Shit!
Damn it!
- That' s a great shot, Lins.
- You drop your dive light?
Come on, you guys.
That' s the smaller one.
That' s the smaller one here.
- You can see how it' s zigging around.
- Whatever it is.
I' m telling you what it is.
You' re just not hearing me.
- Now, Lindsey...
- There is something down there.
- Something not us.
- You could be more... specific.
- Something that zigs.
- Not us.
Not human.
Get it?
Something non- human but intelligent.
A non- terrestrial intelligence.
A non- terrestrial intelligence.
Oh, man, that' s better than UFOs.
But that works too.
Underwater Flying Objects.
- Are we talking little space friends here?
- Hell, yeah!
Hot rods of the gods!
Right, Lins?
No, no, really.
It could be NTls.
- The ClA has known about 'em for ever.
- Step outside.
- They abduct people all the time, man.
- Hippy, would you do me a favour?
Stay off my side.
- Will you step into my office, please?
- Certainly.
Come here.
- Jesus, Lins!
- Something really important' s happening.
I' m trying to keep the situation under control.
I can' t allow this kind of hysteria.
Who' s hysterical?!
Nobody' s hysterical!
When you' re hanging on by your fingernails, you don' t go waving your arms around.
I' m sorry.
- Please.
- You are the most stubborn woman I know.
Yes, I am!
But I need you to believe me right now.
Now, come on.
Look at me.
Come on.
Am I stressed out?
Do I have any symptoms of pressure - sickness, tremors, slurred speech?
- No.
- No.
Bud, this is me - Lindsey.
OK?
You know me better than anybody in the world.
Now watch my lips.
I saw these things.
I touched one of them.
And... it wasn' t some clunky steel can...... like we would build.
It glided.
It was the most beautiful thing I' ve ever seen.
Oh, God, I wish you' d been there.
It was a machine.
It was a machine, but it was alive.
It was like a... like a dance of light.
Please.
You have to trust me.
Now, I don' t think they mean us any harm.
I don' t know how I know that.
It' s just... a feeling.
I' m supposed to go on a feeling?
How can I go on a feeling?
- You think Coffey' s gonna go on a feeling?
- Well, we all see what we wanna see.
Coffey looks and he sees Russians.
He sees hate and fear.
You have to look with better eyes than that.
Please.
I can' t, Lins.
I' m sorry.
All I want is 24- hour surveillance on exterior cameras.
- You' ve got six people.
I' ve got...
- Comin 'through!
Everybody just stop!
All right.
I want around- the- clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.
That Russian bogey comes back,
- I don' t think we should be taking a nap.
- Give me a break, Coffey.
Those things live three and a half miles down in an abyssal trench.
Trust me, they' re not speaking Russian.
Have you finished the repairs
- on the acoustical transmitter yet?
- Nope.
- Why not?
- I was having my nails done.
Well, get it done.
Kiss my ass.
All right.
Get something straight.
You people are under my authority.
Look, pardner... we don' t work for you.
We don' t take orders from you.
And we don' t much like you.
Hey, Cat!
Yeah.
OK?
Right on.
Sonny, you get a couple of hours' sleep.
Then you spell Cat, all right?
Hippy, you handle exterior surveillance.
One Night...
Will you do me a favour and see if you can get that transmitter fixed?
- All right?
- Give me a couple of hours.
Got it.
All right.
Come on, AJ Squared Away.
A little to the left.
What is...?
Oh, this is not happening.
I' m shaking, man.
All right.
Wait.
And now...
Here' s MlRV!
- Oh, come on, man!
What else could it be?
- Why bring it here?
It' s gotta be some kind of emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians, right?
Look, they hot- wire one of the nukes.
They use some kind of detonator that they brought.
Then they stick it back in the sub.
Bam!
Slicker than snot.
I' m tellin 'you.
And I' m not being paranoi...
Hi, Lins.
- Lins, will you just wait a second?
- If you don' t do something about it, I will!
- Lindsey, we' il do something about it!
- Fellas?!
Hello!
- Lins!
Stop and think about this for a second.
- What?
You know, you' ve got some huevos bringing that thing into my rig.
With all that' s goin 'on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon
- in here!
- Mrs Brigman...
Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is itjust me?
Mrs Brigman, you don' t need to know the details of our operation.
- You' re right!
I don' t need to know!
Do you hear me, Roger Ramjet?!
You' re becoming a serious impediment to our mission.
Now, you either do an about- face and walk out of here, or I' il have you escorted out.
I will not do an about- face and get outta here!
- Who the hell do you think you' re talking to?
Maintenance Room B!
Move it!
On the double!
Now!
- In here!
Come on!
Come on!
- What' s goin 'on?
All right!
- What' s up?
What' s happening?
- You let her go, man.
Do it.
Do it now!
Let her go.
The smartest thing you ever did.
- Coffey, you son of a bitch!
- Lindsey!
Cool it.
- Nothing.
We were just leaving.
Weren' t we?
We don' t need them.
We can' t trust them.
We may have to take steps.
We' re gonna have to take steps.
Lins, I want you to stay away from that guy.
I mean it.
The guy is gone.
Did you see his hands?
What?
He' s got the shakes?
Look, he' s operating on his own.
He' s cut off from his chain of command.
He' s showing signs of pressure- induced psychosis.
And he' s got a nuclear weapon.
So, as a personal favour to me, will you try to put your tongue in neutral for a while?
I give this whole thing a sphincter factor of about 9. 5.
You can just punch into his primary guidance chip where you want him to go
- and he' il go there, right?
- No.
Bad idea, Lindsey.
Why, Hip?
Come on.
Because even if it could take the pressure at that depth, which I don' t think it can, without the tether, you know what would happen?
It would just sit like a dumb shit.
Something would have to pass in front of the camera for you to see anything.
But we could get lucky.
So we should go for it.
I really ought to talk to Bud about this.
No.
We get proof and then we tell the others.
Hippy, look.
If we can prove to Coffey that there aren' t Russians down there, maybe he' il ease off the button a little bit.
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me more than anything we' re gonna find down there.
He' s a goddamn AJ Squared Away jarhead robot!
Give me a couple of hours.
I' il see what I can do.
Great.
Thanks.
How' s that?
Thanks.
Virgil, turn on your side.
All right.
You' re all set, big guy.
Hey, I told you to wipe that grin off your face.
Good night, little buddy.
Bud!
Get up!
Cat?
Cat!
Hey!
Goddamn...
Leave me alone.
Bud!
No, wait.
It' s OK.
Sweet Christ almighty!
I think it likes you.
It' s trying to communicate.
It' s Bud.
- It' s wonderful!
- It' s me!
- No.
Don' t...
- It' s OK.
Is it alive?
Lindsey, no...
Seawater.
Oh, man.
Come on!
- Hurry!
- Where the hell' s it going?
Hurry!
I think it' s headed for B module!
Lins, you see it?
So, raise your hand if you think it was a Russian water tentacle.
Lieutenant?
No?
Well...
A breakthrough.
Hey, ace,
- you done impressing yourself?
- No way that thing could just be seawater.
They must have learned to control water.
I mean, at a molecular level.
They can plasticise it, pulverise it, do whatever they wanna do with it.
- They can put it under intelligent control.
- Maybe... their whole technology is based on that- controlling water.
Was it the same thing that you saw the last time?
No.
You know, I don' t think that that thing you saw was one of them.
- What are you talkin 'about?
- I mean, I don' t think it was an NTl.
I think it was like their version of an ROV.
Like Big Geek.
Hippy, you mean they was just checkin 'us out?
- Yeah.
- How come?
Curious, I suppose.
We' re probably the first people they' ve ever seen.
It went straight for the warhead.
And they think it' s cute!
You need to get some sleep.
We have no...... way of warning the surface.
And you know what that means?
It means whatever happens...... is up to us.
Us.
So you think they' re from down there originally?
Or from...... you know.
I don' t know.
I think...
I think they' re from "you know".
Someplace with similar conditions.
- Cold, intense pressure.
- Oh, man!
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, probably.
Sniff something?
Did you, rat boy?
Hey!
Freeze!
Don' t move!
That' s right.
- OK, Hip?
- They' re using Big Geek
- to take the bomb to the NTls.
- What?
We set it up to go right to 'em.
Oh, my God!
Take this.
We' re going to Phase Three.
What?
We don' t have orders for that!
I programmed Big Geek to go down to the bottom of the trench and shoot some video.
- Now they got the warhead tied to it.
- Coffey.
Coffey...
Come on, Coffey.
Just think about what you' re doing, OK?
Just think about what you' re doing!
Get back!
This is something I' ve wanted to do since we first met.
Take it easy.
- All right!
Into the kitchen!
Let' s go!
- Get your damn hands off of me!
I know the way.
Your boss is fixin 'to pull the pin on 50 kilotons.
And we' re all gonna be ringside!
He' s havin 'a full- on meltdown!
- What' s the timer set for?
- Three hours.
- Shut up!
Don' t talk.
- Three hours.
We can' t get to minimum safe distance in three hours.
We can' t go to Phase Three.
What about these people?
Shut up!
What' s the matter with you?
Everybody just stay calm.
The situation is under control.
Anybody touches that door, kill 'em.
Shoenick!
Your lieutenant' s about to make a real bad career move!
The guy is crazier than a shithouse rat!
- Can' t you see he' s lost it?
- Shut up!
- The shock wave' il kill us.
- Quiet!
It' il crush this rig like a beer can.
- Shut up, man!
- We gotta stop him.
Shut up!
This is not our mission.
We can' t detonate without orders.
He' s about to declare war on an alien species just when they' re trying to make contact with us.
- I don' t know.
I think I' m reaching him.
- Yeah!
I' il be damned.
- Jammer.
- Is everybody OK?
Oh, man!
- Don' t move, jarface!
- Look, I' m the least of your problems.
Take it easy, Hippy.
How you feeling, big guy?
I' m OK, Bud.
I...
I just... figured I was dead back there when I saw that angel coming for me.
Yeah, OK.
Why don' t you tell us about it later?
- Come on.
- He' s got it tied off with something.
Come on.
Ready?
- We' re not gonna be able to budge it.
This is the only door to sub- bay.
- What are you doing?
- I' m gonna swim to hatch six.
What?!
I' m gonna get inside
- and open the door from the other side.
- Bud, this water is freezing.
Then I guess you' d better wish me luck, huh?
- Wish us luck.
- You comin 'along?
Looks that way.
- All right, Cat.
- Come on, Bud.
- In case I don' t die...
- This is insane.
Come on, Bud.
Let' s go, pardner.
I ain' t got all day.
Come on.
Yank on it.
We have to go to the moon pool.
- It' s the only way.
- I can' t.
I can' t make it, pardner.
I' m sorry.
OK, Cat.
You head on back, all right?
- What is he doing?
- He can' t make it to the door.
- He' s gonna try and take him out himself.
God, he couldn' t be that dumb.
That guy' s a trained killer.
No!
Coffey...
Coffey, listen.
Hey!
Hey!
- Bud, you all right?
- Get him, Cat!
- He' s dogged it, Bud!
- We gotta get this off of here.
Help me.
Pull the gripper!
Cat, get the door!
Shit!
Come on!
Shoot!
You all right?
The safety' s on!
Give me that!
Let' s go!
Help me out!
Let' s move it.
- One Night, what about Cab 1?
- Ready to launch.
Go!
You' re better in these than I am.
You got air?
Come on.
You got air.
Shit!
Bud, get out of the way!
Shit!
Get in!
Hurry up!
I' m comin ', baby!
Keep your pantyhose on.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Right out in front.
OK.
Get on the arm.
- To the left.
A little more.
- You missed.
Try it again.
Steady.
- Grab it!
- Yeah, got it!
- Pretty slick, Slick.
- Hold it really steady.
- Hold it still.
- I am.
Shit!
We lost Geek!
Where is he, Bud?
Do you see him?
I' il take a look.
- He' s comin 'up fast.
Step on it!
- Shit!
- Go to the right!
Swing to the right!
- Shit!
Keep movin ', baby!
Come here.
Son of a bitch!
Hard left, baby!
Left!
Jesus Christ, lady!
If you think you can do any better, you' re welcome!
Son of a bitch!
- Is he right on us?
- Right on your ass.
OK.
- Where you goin '?
- Hang on!
Deepcore, this is Cab 1.
Do you read?
Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab 1.
Over.
I' m not getting any answer!
And we' re flooding like a son of a bitch.
Yeah.
You noticed?
You did OK back there, Virgil.
- I was fairly impressed.
- Yeah, well, not good enough.
- We still gotta catch Big Geek.
- Yeah, well, not in this thing.
Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab 1.
Over.
Try it again.
We need a...
You all right?
Yeah.
Well, that' s that.
Yeah, wonderful.
There' s some light comin 'from somewhere.
Off to the right.
Yeah, that' s the rig.
It' s a good 60, 70 yards, I' d say.
Well, they' il come after us.
Yeah, but it' s gonna take 'em a while to get here.
We gotta get this flooding stopped.
- Can you see where it' s coming in?
- Yeah.
Can you hold the lamp?
There' s a busted fitting behind this panel.
Problem is I don' t think I can get to it.
- You got any tools?
- Uh, I don' t know.
I' il have to look around.
Yeah, well, I looked already.
Goddamn it!
All I need' s a goddamn crescent wrench!
Come on.
Son of a bitch!
Calm down, Bud.
- Calm down.
- OK.
OK.
We gotta get you outta here.
- How?
- I don' t know how.
- All right.
We' ve only got one suit.
- We gotta come up with something.
- Oh, my God!
I' m freezing!
- Come here.
Give me your hands.
Listen, you' re smart.
Think of something.
Can' t you think of something?
Why don' t you swim back to the rig and bring back another suit?
That' il take me about seven or eight minutes to swim, get the gear, and come back.
I wouldn' t make it.
By the time I got back, you' d be...
OK.
Let' s look around.
Let' s look.
Oh, my God!
Is that working?
Shit!
All right.
Here.
You put this on.
- No!
Are you growing gills all of a sudden?
- Don' t argue with me, goddamn it!
- This is not an option, so forget about it!
- Lindsey, shut up and put this thing on!
- If you' d be logical...
- Fuck logic!
You' ve got the suit on and you' re a better swimmer than I am, right?
- Yeah, maybe.
- Right?
Yes!
So I' ve got a plan.
- What' s the plan?
- I drown, and you tow me back to the rig.
No!
Yes!
This water' s only a couple of degrees above freezing.
I' il... go into deep hypothermia.
My blood' il go like ice water.
My body systems will slow down.
They won' t stop.
I can be revived after maybe
- 10 or 15 minutes.
- Lins, put this on!
You put it on!
It' s the only way!
You just put this on!
Put this on.
You know I' m right.
It' s the only way.
You' ve got all the... stuff on the rig to do this.
Put this on.
Bud, please!
- This is insane.
- I know.
Oh, my God.
- Are you OK?
- It' s the only way.
All right.
Here.
Hold this.
Son of a bitch.
Hold on, Lindsey.
You can do this, you know.
- You can do this.
- God, Lins...
I...
I know.
You can tell me later.
This is maybe not such a good idea!
Oh, my God!
Bud!
No!
I can' t!
Oh, Bud, I' m scared!
No!
I got him!
- Where?
- Oh, my God!
It' s Lindsey.
- Deepcore, do you read?
Over.
- Yeah, we got you, Bud.
- We' re here.
- Go to the infirmary.
Get the cart oxygen, defib kit, adrenaline in a 10cc syringe, and some heating blankets.
- Meet me at the moon pool and make it fast!
Now!
Come on!
Let' s go!
Hippy, get the hot packs!
Got 'em!
Here he comes!
- Watch her head.
- I got it.
I got it.
Watch her feet.
Watch...
Clear it out.
Is she clear?
Get the defib ready.
Hurry up, Cat.
OK.
Got it.
- OK?
- Yeah.
Three one thousand... four one thousand...
Breathe.
One one thousand... two one thousand... three one thousand...
No!
You gotta have bare skin or it won' t work!
Three one thousand... four one thousand...
Here.
Is that right?
- I got it.
- Well, do it!
Breathe!
- Come on!
Zap her!
- Clear!
- Come on, baby!
Oh, Christ!
- Nothing.
Breathe.
- I' il jack it up to three hundred.
Zap her again.
It' s going, it' s going.
It' s charging.
Charging...
- Now!
- Clear!
- Anything?
- No pulse.
- Come on, baby!
- Charging one more time.
Zap her again.
Come on!
- Come on!
- Clear!
God!
No pulse.
It' s flat.
Goddamn!
It' s flat.
Get outta here.
One, two, three, four, five one thousand.
One, two, three, four... breathe!
One, two, three, four... breathe!
Come on, baby.
One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, four one thousand...
Come on, baby.
One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand...
Breathe!
Come on!
Two one thousand, three one thousand...
Bud...
It' s all over, man.
It' s all over.
I' m sorry.
No pulse.
No!
No, she has a strong heart!
She wants to live!
Come on, Lins!
Come on, baby!
Do it!
- Charging.
Do it!
Clear.
Clear!
Get outta here!
Come on.
Breathe, baby.
Goddamn it!
Breathe!
Goddamn it, you bitch!
You never backed away from anything in your life!
Now fight!
Fight!
Right now!
Do it!
Fight, goddamn it!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Lins?
That' s it, Lindsey.
That' s it, Lins.
You can do it.
That' s it, Lins.
Come on back, baby.
Come on.
You can do it, baby.
Get her some air.
Breathe.
You did it, ace!
God!
Make sure her heart' s OK.
Big boys don' t cry, remember?
Hi, lady.
Hi, tough guy.
I guess it worked, didn' t it?
Yeah.
Of course it did.
You' re never wrong, are you?
How you feelin '?
I feel better.
What did you do to me?
Next time it' s your turn, OK?
Yeah, you got that right.
These are so your eyes can focus in the breathing fluid.
How' s that feel?
If you can' t see, you can' t disarm the bomb.
OK.
With this much weight, you' re gonna fall like a brick.
We' ve still got about an hour, so you should get there in plenty of time.
When you get down there, all you gotta do is cut a wire, drop the weights and come home.
- Hand me that wrench.
- Maybe I oughta check everything.
That' s loose.
I' il fix that up.
Bud, you don' t have to do this.
Somebody' s gotta do it.
It doesn' t have to be you.
Who then?
So, what, I can hear you but I can' t talk, right?
The fluid prevents the larynx from making sound.
Excuse me.
- It' il feel a little strange.
- Yeah, no shit.
I gotta warn you all...
I' m a pretty lousy typist.
The moment of truth.
Let' s go.
Easy.
- I need it in the front a little bit.
- OK.
- Thank you.
- You got it.
- Set.
- Clamp?
Set.
OK, let' s rock and roll!
Crack it.
Headset, please.
- OK.
- Relax now, Bud.
Just relax.
- Bud.
- Relax now, Bud.
Watch me.
OK?
Watch me.
Watch me.
Don' t hold your breath.
Take it in.
Just let yourself take it in.
Take it in.
That' s it.
Don' t hold your breath now.
There you go.
Don' t hold your breath.
Take it in.
That' s it.
- There you go.
- Bud!
This is not normal!
It' s normal!
Lt' il pass in a second!
It' s perfectly normal!
- It' s not normal.
- It' s perfectly normal.
We all breathe liquid for nine months, Bud.
That' s it.
That' s it.
- Perfectly normal.
- Christ!
He' s breathing!
Give me that.
- Can you hear me?
- There he goes.
Yes?
OK.
Bud...
Try your keypad.
I already have.
Great.
Let' s go!
- Hippy, you got that?
- Hold on, Jammer.
Easy.
Watch out.
Watch his back.
Watch the back.
Careful.
I redid Little Geek' s chip the same as Big Geek!
It should take you straight there!
All you have to do is hang on!
What' s his depth?
- 3200 feet.
- Your depth is 3200 feet.
You' re doing fine.
Now, you better watch out for crane wreckage.
You should be almost to it.
4800 feet.
It' s official.
Yeah.
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.
Bet you didn' t think you' d be doing this when you got up this morning, huh?
One mile down.
Still grinnin '.
8500 feet.
8500 feet, Bud.
Everything OK?
Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
Ensign Monk wants to know how you feel.
It' s starting.
It hits the nervous system first.
Keep talking.
Let him hear your voice.
OK, Bud.
Your depth is 8900 feet.
- You' re doing fine.
- No, Lindsey.
Talk to him.
Bud...
There' s some... some things I need to say.
It' s hard for me, you know.
It' s not easy being a cast- iron bitch.
It takes discipline and years of training.
A lot of people don' t appreciate that.
Jesus, I' m sorry I can' t tell you these things to your face.
I have to wait till you' re alone in the dark, freezing, and there' s 10, 000 feet of water between us.
I' m sorry.
I' m rambling.
Comin 'up on the big ten thou.
12, 000 feet.
Jesus!
- I don' t believe he' s doin 'this!
- Hippy!
Shut up!
What' s wrong with you?
Bud, how are you doing?
Signal' s fading.
No!
No, Bud, I' m not going away.
I' m right here.
Kill everything we don' t need.
Go!
Go!
Run it through the digital processor!
Cook it as much as you can!
I am right here with you, Bud.
Bud, this is Lindsey.
Please.
I' m right here with you.
OK?
So try and stay calm.
I' m right here, all right?
Bud.
He' s losing it.
- Talk to him.
Keep him with us.
- Comin 'up on 16, 000 feet.
No, Bud, it' s the pressure, all right?
You have to listen to my voice.
You have to try.
Concentrate, all right?
Just listen to my voice.
Please.
17, 000 feet.
Christ almighty, this is insane.
Bud?
I' m not getting anything!
- Whoa!
No!
- What?
- Little Geekjust folded.
- Jesus.
He can still make it.
OK.
Bud?
I know how alone you feel.
Alone in all that... cold... blackness.
But I' m there in the dark with you.
Oh, Bud.
You' re not alone.
Oh, God!
You remember that time...
You were pretty drunk.
You probably don' t remember.
The power went out in that little apartment we had on Orange Street.
like every one of us is out there alone in the dark in this life. "
And you just... you just lit up another candle and you put it beside mine, and you said "No.
See, that' s me.
That' s me. "
And we stared at the two candles and then...
Well, if you remember any of this, I' m sure you remember the next part.
But there are two candles in the dark.
I' m with you.
I' il always be with you, Bud.
I promise that.
How you doin ', pardner?
You still with us?
Come back.
You talk to us, Buddy boy.
- Come on.
- Bud?
Talk to me, Bud.
Now, come on.
You hangin 'in there?
You have to talk to me, Bud!
Please!
I need to know if you' re OK.
You... you see light?
What kind of light, Bud?
He' s hallucinating badly.
- He made it.
- Oh, my God.
OK, Bud.
We' il go step by step.
Remove the detonator housing by unscrewing it counterclockwise.
All right, Bud.
You have to cut the ground wire.
Not the lead wire.
It' s the blue wire with the white stripe.
Not, I repeat, not the black wire with the yellow stripe.
Quiet!
Save your air.
Bud, give me a reading off your liquid oxygen gauge.
What?
- It took him 30 minutes to get there!
- Bud!
Do you hear me?
You drop your weights and start back now!
That gauge could be wrong.
Do you hear me?
Just drop your weights and start back now!
Your gauge could be wrong!
Your gauge could be wrong!
You drop your weights and start back now!
You won' t stay there.
You drop your weights.
You can breathe shallow!
Do you hear me?
Bud, please listen to me!
Please!
Goddamn it!
You dragged me back from that bottomless pit!
You can' t leave me here alone now.
Please!
Oh, God, Virgil!
Please!
Please!
I love you.
Howdy.
How are you guys doin '?
Attempts to convene a summit between heads of state have collapsed...
The Soviet build- up of tanks and aircraft has...
All citizens to stay on their jobs, restrict unnecessary travel...... what officials are calling an unprovoked attack.
Oh, shit!
Across the country, National Guard units have been mobilised and all civil defence volunteers have been called to full- time duty.
You watch our TV.
That' s what you' re telling me.
- You know what' s going on up there.
- Seismologists are reporting an enormous disturbance throughout the world' s oceans which apparently began about 15 minutes ago.
They are acoustic shock waves like tsunamis, but with no apparent seismological source.
The waves are propagating towards the shorelines of every continent.
- I' m sorry.
That' s...
- Dr Berg, would you please...
Young lady.
Young lady, listen to me.
I don' t know.
We don' t know what' s going on yet.
We don' t have a clue.
The horizon has already grown dark.
People are running everywhere.
It' s sheer panic.
Stay on me!
The wave... the wave is, I don' t know, maybe 1, 000 feet high already.
Getting bigger as I' m watching, still miles out.
- My God!
- Get outta here!
Stay!
We' re staying!
Give it to me, then!
I don' t even know if I' m still broadcasting.
I can' t be sure.
I' il just keep going as long as I can.
You guys are doing this.
You guys are doing this, right?
You can control water.
That' s your technology, but why are you doing this?
That' s enough.
How do you know they' re really gonna do it?
Where do you get off passing judgement on us?
You can' t be sure.
How do you know?
You could' ve done it.
Why didn' t you?
Deepcore, do you read?
This is Benthic Explorer.
Over.
Do you hear, Deepcore?
Deepcore, do you read?
Do you read me, Deepcore?
Deepcore, do you read?
This is Benthic Explorer.
Over.
Hell, yes, we read!
Good of you to join us!
Copy, Deepcore.
Hey, I' ve got 'em!
How' s that storm goin 'up there?
It just blew itself out all of a sudden.
Well, hell, son.
You' d better get a line down to us.
We' re in moderately poor shape down here.
We' ve lost seven people, including Bud.
And we' re about out of O2, so whatever you' re gonna do...
You make up your mind how to get us outta here?
They' re talking about flying in a DSRV from Norfolk.
- OK.
How long' s that gonna take?
How do you stop a half- mile- high tidal wave...
Hey...
- Hey!
It' s Bud!
- That' s impossible.
- No, it' s not.
- Do you hear, Deepcore?
Yes!
Wait.
We' ve got a message from Bud.
- Bud?
- What' s it say?
Here.
It says...
It says "Virgil Brigman back on the air."
"Have some new friends down here."
"Guess they' ve been here a while."
"They' ve left us alone, but it bothers them to see us hurting each other."
"Getting out of hand."
"They sent a message.
Hope you got it. "
I' d say that' s a big ten- four, Jack.
"They want us to grow up a bit and put away childish things."
"Of course, it' s just a suggestion."
Looks like you boys might be out of business.
What the hell' s goin 'on?
One Night, get to sonar.
Good God almighty!
Fellas...
I' m gettin 'some awful big readings here.
- Something' s comin 'up the wall!
- What is it?
Whatever it is, it' s major!
Something is definitely going on down there.
Active is pinging back something really big.
It' s huge!
- It' s coming up underneath us.
- Where?
Where?
There!
Starboard bow!
There!
Look!
Help, Cat!
We should be dead.
We didn' t decompress.
They must have done something to us.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I think you could say that.
Hi, Brigman.
Hi, Mrs Brigman.

Gordon, it' s up to you.
I don' t wanna see any goats around after the game.
Now, you miss this shot... you' re not just lettin 'me down, you' re lettin' your team down.
Let' s go, son!
All my client did was attempt to give you what you wanted!
Isn' t that right?
This man put his neck on the line for your greed.
Your Honour?
I just wanna make a point.
So nod like I' m saying something important.
- Gordon, what are you doing?
- Get out there and be my lawyer.
- Perfect.
Nice tie, Frank.
Oh, Mr. Bombay, I' m so glad you could make it.
Please restrict yourself to a relevant cross- examination!
Your Honour, the applicability of societal intent... vis- a- vis individual action is well established.
I' m citing Minneapolis V. Higgins.
The appellant court overruled a judge who disallowed similar testimony.
Now, if I' m not mistaken, that was... you.
Wasn' t it, Judge Weathers?
I stand corrected, counsellor.
Oh, you really stooped to an all- time low on this, Bombay.
I' m insulted, Frank.
I don' t mind losing.
Losing fair is still losing, Frank.
And what about justice?
It was your job to put him there.
Don' t take it out on me!
Next time do your job, Frankie boy.
We don' t count that one because I scored with the court reporter.
- The one you said had the intelligent body?
- Not yet.
I saw him in the back of the courtroom.
How about some kudos here, huh?
Mr. Tolbert dropped off ringside seats for tonight' s North Stars game.
Gordon, here' s the research for the Pearlstein Project.
- Can you get started?
Can' t you see I' m reveling here?
Today I' m 30 and 0!
- Type, Jeannie, don' t speak.
Mr. Bombay' s office.
You' re right.
Ha- ha- ha!
Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth!
It was nothing, Mr. Ducksworth.
Gordon, another fine job today.
- Thank you, sir.
Score.
I' m not sure I understand what you mean, sir.
This is a business.
Next time a little restraint might be in order.
- ~Forget your fellow man Yeah yeah uh- huh ~
- Pull your vehicle over to the right, now!
- ~ Hey, man, whoa yeah yeah ~ - Licence, please.
- Could you turn down the stereo?
I guess it was a "widdle" noisy.
A "widdle"?
Breath, blood or urine?
No, thanks, I' m full.
The charges against Mr. Bombay are driving under the influence, driving with an open container and reckless endangerment.
And to think I almost stayed home this morning.
I assume you' re representing yourself?
Twelve moving violations in three years?
How do you still have a licence?
Suspension of licence?
Yes, unless the D. A. 's office will allow you to plead guilty to lesser charges.
But that' s solely up to the prosecutor.
The city of Minneapolis does not wish to pursue a plea bargain in this case.
- Gotta go for the "W," right, Gordo?
The defendant is released on his own recognizance.
Mr. Ducksworth.
I own the place.
RlCOH Statute stuff.
Oh, I thought you might be researching your defence... against D. U. I. and reckless endangerment.
Did you think I wouldn' t find out, Gordon?
Frank Huddy just wants my scalp.
I' m gonna plead not guilty -
There' s not going to be a loophole.
I am not going to have you drag... this firm' s good name through the mud.
I' ve talked toJudge Weathers and he has agreed to suspend your case.
- Probation, suspension of your driver' s licence... and 500 hours of community service.
And a leave of absence from the firm.
He can' t do that.
- He can' t stop me from working!
I am.
Gordon, you need a break.
- But, sir, my work is my life.
That' s just my point.
It' il teach you compassion, a sense of fair play, how to fit in.
- Community service?
This is horrible.
- You' il get used to it.
And hopefully you' il come back a better person and a better attorney, which is why I' m keeping you on salary and have arranged a driver for you.
You know, in the early '7 Os I drove the tour bus for The Grand Funk Railroad.
Chicks, parties, amps cranked up to about eight jillion decibels.
All that loud music damaged my hearing, but I got no regrets...
- except for the '80s.
Community service... coaching hockey!
I found one!
I' m comin 'out!
Karp, you finally found something for once in your life.
Dumpster Dave comes through!
- What do you think?
- Lovely, Karp, it goes with your eyes.
- Remind me to bust you, Averman.
- Did you get it?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Here, boy.
A little chili to keep you warm, buddy.
- Oh, yeah, that' s nice.
I can' t believe he ate the can too.
He sniffs.
He sniffs again.
Looking for that perfect place.
He sniffs some more.
I think this is it!
He' s turnin 'in a circle.
- He squats!
Come on, come on, give me the dollar!
Yeah.
He' s takin' off with it.
This guy deserves what he gets.
Oh, guys, he saw us.
Rink' s gotta be around here someplace.
Just look for a sign that says "Personal Hell."
I hate kids.
Keep it down, please!
Hey, come on.
Let' s talk, come on.
I' m your friend, aren' t I?
I' m tired of chasin 'the puck.
Be careful, man.
Goldberg, you' re the goalie.
It' s supposed to hit you.
Good God.
That' s the hockey team.
Drive out on the ice.
It' il be all right.
- You don' t know what you' re doin '.
- Shut your face, Karp.
We' re gonna get in big trouble.
- I' il take care of it.
Yo, dude.
This is my dominion.
This is a drug- free zone, you understand?
We ain' t buyin 'nothin'.
So I' m gonna let you get your sorry vanilla bootie outta here... before we be usin 'your eyeballs as hockey pucks.
Thanks, bro, but I' m not goin 'home' til I take care of business.
District Five Pee Wee hockey team.
I' m the new coach.
- Yeah, right.
- Afraid so, dude.
Got the roster right here.
Averman, Dave.
Conway, Charlie.
Hall, Terry.
I hate hockey and I don' t like kids.
What' s this supposed to be, a pep talk?
I' m sure this' il be a real bonding experience.
Maybe one day one of you will even write a book about it in jail.
- Funny.
Only for a little while.
- Thank you for sharing that.
All right, get out on the ice.
Let me see what you can do.
Uh, just so you know.
I' il decide who sucks around here.
- They really suck.
The Pete- meister.
Passing the puck over toJesse- roonie, the enforcer.
Ouch!
That hurt!
Oh, it' s the Connie- meister, the velvet hammer.
I' m Connie.
- Do you play?
- No.
0 and 9.
We only lost by five.
We almost scored a goal too.
So what do we do now... coach?
- What did your old coach have you do?
- He just yelled a lot.
- His arm?
Oh, you suck, you!
Heart attack.
Great.
All right, look.
I gotta make a phone call.
You, you, you, you and you against you four.
- We got names, you know?
- I' m sure you do.
I might even learn 'em.
Oh, and if you need anything, fax me.
Geez, what a jerk.
We' re impressionable kids, right?
Jeannie, who told you not to give me my messages?
Then who' s handling my cases?
- On three!
- One, two, three!
She' s outta law school one year.
She' s not qualified to -
Get your mouth off the windows!
- Get off there!
Get off the car!
- Get off the roof, you little monkey.
- Is that a real phone?
- Not any more.
- Thank you.
- Let' s see, who should I - - Watch the upholstery.
- Don' t touch that.
- We wanna ride!
We wanna ride!
- I could kill one of' em just to set an example.
Not yet, Lewis.
Take 'em for a spin, anything!
This looks good.
- Wow, I feel like Madonna.
- You wish!
Seats ten comfortably.
Hey, pass me one of those glasses.
Goldberg!
- It wasn' t me, all right!
It wasn' t me!
Oh, man!
- She looks pissed.
All right, out!
Everybody, out of the car right now.
Are you out of your mind?
What were you thinking putting that car on the ice?
- My son was in that car.
One crack in the ice.
- The ice is not gonna crack.
- I' m Gordon Bombay, the new hockey coach.
They send you over here to coach the team and you endanger their lives.
What danger?
I grew up on the ice; I know when it' s safe to drive on.
- I just know!
All right?
Well, listen, Mr. Zen Master, you may be in tune with the ice universe, but when it comes to my kid, "I just know" doesn' t cut it.
Charlie, let' s go.
- Mom?
- Give me my candy!
Well, I guess practise is over.
- Sorry my mom ruined it, guys.
Coach, gonna be at the game tomorrow?
By order of the state of Minnesota, yeah.
- Hi, girls.
Goodbye.
My first game and it had to be the Hawks.
Gordon?
- Coach Reilly.
- We' re both adults now.
Hey, come back to see your old coach, huh?
Well, actually I' m, uh, coaching...
- District Five team.
You got a kid on the team or something?
No, I' m here because I need to be of service to the community.
How about this, huh?
Whoever thought we' d be coachin 'against each other?
So, who' s your hotshot player this year?
- Anyone good?
Might go all the way.
But he wants it more.
Oh, boy,
I wish they would take that one down.
Don' t you?
You' re gonna need it.
You miss this shot, you' re not just...
I wish your dad could be here to see this.
Win!
All right, guys, gather round.
Win!
Yeah, we' re fired up.
Oh, great.
Nice goin ', fool!
- Oh, yeah, "I didn' t mean to."
Yeah, sure, you' re on my own team.
Didn' t mean to.
Would you get off me before I clock you?
Let' s go, Jesse!
Let' s go!
What' s this?
The Oreo line!
Um, batter, batter, hum, batter, batter!
Hey, batter, batter, swing, batter, batter!
- Averman!
It' s hockey!
Idiot.
Hum, goalie, goalie, hum, goalie, goalie!
That' s one!
Easy!
Sloppy pass.
Way to stuff it, Banks!
Let' s run it up!
Oh, man!
All right, line change.
Banks!
Hey, you!
Why me?
How lazy can you be?
They' re killing us out there!
How many times do I have to tell you:
Get those rebounds, get your heads up, get those loose pucks.
Get - Just -
All right!
Hey, hey!
All right!
That' s okay, Charlie!
Keep swingin '.
Hey, hey, hey, knock it off!
Against this team we should have twice this many!
Remember it' s not worth winning if you can' t win big!
Come on, let' s talk about this!
Oh no, guys!
Just take the goal.
- I' m so embarrassed.
- We need a new goalie.
Hey, knock it off!
Anybody could beat these pansies.
I want you guys to stay hungry out there!
- Okay, boys.
- All right!
Nice game.
I enjoyed it thoroughly.
Hey, shut up!
I thought we came here to play hockey.
You know, I knew we forgot something.
Oh, you think it' s funny?
Well, not at first, but once you get the hang of it.
We' re the ones out there gettin 'our butts kicked.
Yeah, it' s not like you coach us or anything.
You didn' t listen to a word I said.
I said, hustle.
Why the hell don' t you just listen to me?
Why the hell should we?
You want to lose, fine.
You' re the ones who look like idiots out there.
Great game!
I don' t believe it!
Who would throw these away?
- First look' s free, next five minutes costs a buck each.
Forget it, Karp.
I can see this every day on MTV.
This one' s from Minneapolis.
- Let' s give him a wedgie.
I was just kidding, okay?
- Hi, girls.
- Does your mommy know you have that?
Nah, she' s busy with the mailman.
That' il make great bathroom reading.
I found it!
- You gonna let him call you wuss- breath?
Want some more?
Let' s get out!
- Thanks a lot.
One, two, three!
What are you laughing at, cream cheese boy?
Go!
Score one for the spirit.
Go at him!
Go at him!
Come on, make it look real.
Act hurt!
Good, good.
Act hurt!
- Take the fall!
Get indignant!
You guys are ready.
Open your eyes!
Goldberg, you don' t take the fall while they' re shooting at you.
Oh!
- District Five!
- I throw myself on the ice -
One more dive, I forfeit to theJets!
I' m insulted by that!
Let' s go!
Face- off!
Charlie!
That guy is twice your size.
I want you to grab your eye like it' s cut and then hit the ice!
Let' s go.
- Let' s go!
Okay, even 'em up, boys.
- That' s it, Charlie!
Damn it, Charlie!
We can' t even win when we cheat.
- Stupid cake- eater tricks!
- That was embarrassing.
Charlie!
When I tell you to do something, you do it!
Look at me.
- You can' t make me cheat.
Jesse, Terry, let' s go.
To see my kids takin 'falls?
Gordon.
Just like you used to.
You' d spend hours watching me do this.
What do you think?
Ow!
- Did you cut yourself?
You always fell for that.
- God, you' re morbid, Hans.
- No, I' m Scandinavian.
- It' s nice to see you.
You probably thought I was dead.
I saw you at the game the other night.
You were so busy screaming at the kids.
I didn' t want to spoil the moment.
- Everything' s the same.
Why should my store?
- Heard you became a doctor.
Oh, that' s too bad.
Enjoy that?
That is not what I asked.
I see you still have this up.
- It is important to remember the past.
I' d just as soon forget it.
That was the worse time in my life.
My dad died that year.
- No, but it felt like they were.
I found this not long ago.
He was proud of you.
You scored 198 goals in that season, Gordon.
It' s a shame you quit.
- Could have gone all the way.
You really loved to play.
You remember?
You remember... you used to play on the ponds until after dark, until your father called you back.
You really flew on that ice, Gordon.
Then why did you stop?
Reilly?
I saw what he did to you.
Reilly is an idiot.
- The guy wins.
- It' s not about winning.
Just show they how to play.
Show them how to have fun.
Lawyer.
And long after they' ve stopped buying skates from me.
Here... there you are.
Sharpened, laced, ready to go.
- Your new skates.
That is why you came here tonight, isn' t it?
- I figured nine and a half was your size.
Wear thick socks, Gordon.
Enjoy them.
Here comes Bombay on an end- to- end rush.
Past the blue line, past centre.
Fakes three times!
Yes!
What a play!
What a guy!
Gordon Bombay does it again!
Great move, Gordy!
You faked him out of his pads.
You look great out there.
Come on, let' s go inside, get something to eat.
A few more minutes?
Please?
Get outta here.
Charlie doesn' t want... to be on the team any more, and neither he nor I have anything to say to you.
- Well, I have something to say to you.
Now the team can feel miserable between games too, huh?
I came to apologize to Charlie... to both of you.
- Apologize.
Well... you should.
Charlie.
Hey, Charlie, how ya doin '?
I was just, uh, walkin 'around thinkin' and, uh -
Wanna give us a minute?
Listen, it was very wrong of me... to ask you and the other guys to cheat.
I was angry.
I admire that.
And, uh, I just wanted to tell you that, uh, that I' m -
Oh, boy, this is difficult.
- I' m - - You' re sorry.
I' m sorry.
Tell your mom that hopefully it' il be a lot more fun this time around.
What do you say?
- What?
- Charlie!
Uh, no, I - I can' t.
Well, what are you havin '?
Mr. Ducksworth, there are two reasons I came by.
I' m learning a lot about teamwork, fair play and all that junk.
Good, good.
Well, sir, fair play doesn' t come cheap.
These kids, my team, have no money.
They can' t afford rink time, safe equipment, proper uniforms, which makes it difficult for them to compete.
Now imagine, sir, being ten years old and stepping out onto that ice... with old copies of the "Enquirer" taped to your shins instead of pads.
The point I' m trying to make, sir, is that you wouldn' t be taken seriously and neither are these kids.
So I thought maybe the firm could help 'em out.
How much are we talking about? - $15, 000.
Wait a minute.
We name the team after the firm.
Suddenly, we' re the good guys.
Ducksworth, Saver and Gross, the firm that gives back to the community.
I' il get you your own jersey.
Who is that kid?
Thanks, Fulton.
- How come he' s not on the team?
Some preppie school gave him a scholarship... as long as he doesn' t play hockey.
- I heard it was colleges.
- Yeah, but I heard he' s got to repeat the sixth grade.
Gordon Bombay?
Bombay was a Hawk. ~...
Dude, check 'em out, man.
Holy cow.
- They' re pretty good skaters.
He' s in my science class.
- Think they' d want to play hockey with us?
Go get dressed.
Just think of it as figure skating... with a stick.
You' re gonna love it, Tammy.
Lookin 'good, lookin' tough.
Give me five, show me you' re alive!
Mom isn' t gonna like this at all.
You want me to figure skate, then you gotta play hockey.
What do I know about hockey?
More than you think.
Back to basics!
Go!
Shift your weight.
Get comfortable on your edges.
Trust your edges.
That' s okay, Charlie.
Soft hands.
You don' t shoot the puck to your teammate.
Karp, on your feet.
- You send it.
You don' t stop the pass.
You accept it.
Concentration, not strength.
Like the Karate Kid, right?
Just shut up and try it, Averman!
- Send it back, Averman.
Good, Averman.
Good.
Way to go!
Good, cradle it.
Cradle it.
Nice and easy.
I did it!
Really very cute.
- But when are you gonna work with me in goal?
My mother would not approve of this, coach.
This is your bar mitzvah, Goldberg.
It' s more like a circumcision.
Will you come back here?
District Five!
Oh, man, I' m gonna die.
I' m gonna die.
- Nice knowin 'ya, Goldie.
- Fire!
You wimps!
Oh!
Hex goal!
Goalie boot save!
Nice shot, man!
Goldberg!
Goldberg!
I am Goldberg!
Good!
Good hustle!
Conway, way to go.
- You guys hungry?
Tired?
- Do you ache?
- Yeah!
Good!
Be proud of yourself.
Hey, guys!
Excuse me, guys!
You gotta untie me now!
Very funny.
I like it.
No joke, come on, guys.
Hey, coach!
Coach, don' t make me come after you, coach.
Thanks for the ride.
You did real well in practise today, Charlie.
Let me ask you something.
What happened to your dad?
Mom and I left him.
I don' t really remember, but that' s what she says.
You know, when I was a boy, I had to take care of my mother too.
What happened to your dad?
He passed away.
You do a good job takin 'care of your mom.
- Thanks.
- Okay.
- What' s that?
- Huh?
- Victory!
So I' m right in the middle of my cross- examination and I say to the guy,
I usually defend heels like you, you scuzzy, mole- faced rat.
That' s a good one, sir.
Hey!
Hold it!
Look, it was an accident, all right?
Never mind the window.
Where' d you learn to shoot like that?
I just do it.
Do it again.
Well, you' re great at breaking windows.
Do you ever hit the goal?
Well, one out of five.
About the scholarships and how they won' t let you play hockey?
It don' t mean nothin '.
- Why don' t you play for us?
- What do you mean?
- You afraid?
- No, I mean I can' t, you moron.
Is that all that' s stoppin 'ya?
Push, Fulton, push.
Keep your knees bent.
Side to side, good!
Watch it!
Sorry! ~ This is all we got baby It' s got to be enough ~ ~I' d like to try to quit But I don' t know how ~ ~I needed it then and baby I need it right now ~
The Ducks?
We' re the Ducks?
Man, what brain- dead jerk came up with that name?
As a matter of fact, I did.
But I didn' t have a choice.
We' re being sponsored.
Donald and Daisy?
You' d rather be District Five?
Better than some stupid animal.
I' il have you know, Peter, that the Duck is one of the most noble, agile and intelligent creatures of the animal kingdom.
- But they' re wimpy.
Neither do hockey players.
It' s beautiful.
Pretty awesome the way they all stick together.
Ducks never say die.
Ever seen a duck fight?
No way.
Why?
Because the other animals are afraid.
They know that if they mess with one duck, they gotta deal with the whole flock.
I' m proud to be a duck.
And I' d be proud to fly with any one of you.
So how about it?
I' il be a Duck.
Now we' re the Ducks!
The Mighty Ducks!
- What are we?
What the hell are they doing?
Every time you get the puck, you' re the quarterback.
Talk to him, let him know it' s comin '.
Come on, guys.
This isn' t a library.
What a weird- ass team.
- You ready?
Okay, Fulton.
Shoot your heart out.
One out of five.
All right, Let' s forget the past.
We lost a few games, tough!
That was District Five.
- Now we' re the Ducks.
- And the Ducks... are undefeated.
Quack, quack.
What the hell was that?
Dig it outta there!
The Oreo line!
That' s my boy!
Defence, Karp!
I don' t wanna go to school today, Mom.
Shut up, Peter.
Karp, are you okay?
- The Karp- ster used his head to stop the puck.
Let' s get you off the ice.
Get him on the bench, Charlie.
Okay, Ducks, we still got a chance here.
Connie, Terry, Jesse, Guy, time for the secret weapon.
Remember, just like we talked about.
Oh, no.
Get the face- off!
That' s it.
That tie of yours might be what you need to make the play- offs.
- The ducks have a shot at the play- offs?
Everyone but the last two teams are in, remember?
Panthers got the measles and they forfeited the season.
So, you beat the Huskies and you' il make the play- offs.
- Well, we might have to play the Hawks.
Nothing' s changed since I played.
Actually, one little thing has changed.
You wouldn' t even be a Hawk now.
They redrew the district lines last year.
The lake is not the boundary any more.
You' d be a Duck.
I' d be a Duck.
Coach Reilly?
- I' m afraid there' s a bit of a problem.
- One of your players is ineligible.
Banks!
Over here!
- I' m afraid it' s no joke.
- No, just a mistake.
Are you this boy' s father?
450 North Hennipen, is that your address?
- I' m afraid there' s no mistake.
- This boy is playing for the wrong team.
According to league rules, Adam Banks should be playing for District Five.
- My son is a Hawk, not a Duck.
- Is this your doing, Gordon?
I' il expect to see him at our next game.
- We' il have a uniform waiting for you.
My son would rather not play than play for your team.
Fine, if that' s the way you want it.
But remember, if Adam plays for the Hawks, you' il forfeit every game for the rest of the season.
Boy, I' d hate to see that.
Look, I' m sorry this had to happen, but you can see on the map.
Gordon?
You stop when I' m talking to you, son!
You trying to sabotage me or what?
The law' s a bitch when it works against you, isn' t it, Jack?
One kid isn' t gonna make a difference.
Even with Banks, what do you think you' re gonna prove, you and that bunch of losers?
That' s right, coach.
We hate losers, don' t we?
They don' t even deserve to live.
Maybe Banks won' t make a difference, but at least we' re playing by the rules.
Why' d you turn against me, Gordon?
I taught ya how to skate, I taught ya how to score.
You could have been one of the greats.
And now look at yourself.
You' re not even a has- been.
You' re a never- was.
Hey, why aren' t you guys in uniform?
We got warm- ups in half an hour.
I got some good news.
We' re getting a new player, Adam Banks.
- He' s a Hawk.
- Yuck.
- Everybody hates him.
I say we do need him.
- If we make it to the play- offs, he could be a big help.
- If?
No, he thinks we' re losers.
- What?
- We heard what you said.
- That' s not what I meant.
- I saw that picture of you missing that goal.
You were a Hawk, weren' t you?
Guess you guys stick together to the end.
I don' t need your stinkin' equipment.
- See you around.
- Peter, come back here.
- Forget it, cake- eater.
If you wanna play, play with yourself.
Where do you guys think you' re goin '?
I don' t believe this.
All right, I' m goin 'up to the bench because that' s where I' m supposed to be.
Anyone who wants to join me can join me.
Anyone who doesn' t -
Ten minutes to game time, coach.
Yeah, yeah, they' il be out in a minute.
Not much of a frenzy.
We forfeit.
Ducks forfeit.
Flames, you win.
Sure.
I tried.
They think I' m a traitor for even showing up.
I guess they really hate me, huh?
Is it true you were really a Hawk?
Yeah.
Peter said you blew a really big game once.
It was the last game of the state finals.
We were tied 2- 2 in the end of the third period.
I fake the goalie right out of his pads.
Hits the post.
We lost in overtime.
A quarter of an inch, Charlie.
Yeah, but a quarter inch the other way and you' d have missed completely.
I never thought of it that way.
At least you got to play in a championship game.
- Hey.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
I' d love one.
You know, she has many fine qualities that men find attractive.
That fact hasn' t escaped me.
So, what kind of guys does she usually date?
Jerks.
Warp speed!
- Don' t take it personally, Charlie.
- Oh, I wouldn' t even care... except it' s not fair to my mom.
Are you gonna come over for dinner again?
I don' t know, Charlie.
I' m not sure it' s such a good idea.
See, that' s what I wanted to talk to you about.
I, um, talked toJesse and Terry' s dad, and he' s gonna take over coaching for the rest of the year.
- I' m stepping aside to keep the team together.
The guys can' t play for somebody they don' t trust.
I trust you.
They just don' t know it.
- I' ve done all I can.
You gotta make 'em understand.
- We' re your team.
We weren' t even the Ducks until you came along.
Charlie.
That' s right.
The red is oxygen.
Now what are the blue balls?
- Tommy?
- Hydrogen?
Now put them together... and you have a molecule that makes up 96% of your body.
- What is it?
- Pizza?
It' s the principal.
I' il be right back.
Work on H2 CO3.
It' s a goody.
- How' d the forfeit go, Spaz- way?
- Yeah, did you score?
I don' t want to talk about the team.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Everybody knows he likes you best.
- Likes his mom, you mean.
- Take it back, Karp!
- Leave him alone.
- Don' t push her, she' s a girl!
- Don' t shove, Peter.
My atoms!
Sit!
In your seats now!
I have never in my life -
What have you got to say for yourselves?
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!
Thanks for coming by on such short notice, Gordon.
Your community service is over.
So you wanted to talk about my coming back to work then?
- Well, actually - - Oh, you got your jersey.
A lot' s been happening.
Gordon, you know Coach Reilly and Mr. Banks.
Sir, they' re the bad guys.
No, actually, Phil is one of my oldest friends.
Gerald was kind enough to get us all together here to try to work out this little problem.
You see, my son Adam wants to play for the Hawks.
His older brother was a Hawk.
All of his little friends are Hawks.
It' s a tradition.
You understand that, Gordon.
But the league' s already ruled on it.
We' ve talked to the league, and we worked out a little deal.
- You guys cut a deal with the Pee Wee Hockey League?
- Yes, we did.
The long and short of it is that Adam stays on the Hawks for the rest of the season.
- Correctly.
- The league did make one condition.
That you withdraw your protest.
- That' s great.
- Good, good.
Well, that' s settled then.
No, sir, you don' t understand.
I can' t withdraw my protest.
- What?
- Mr. Ducksworth, you wanted me to learn about fair play... and how to be part of a team... and I may not have learned everything yet, but I remember something my father said to me.
A team isn' t a bunch of kids out to win.
A team is something you belong to, something you feel, something you have to earn.
And I' m not gonna let those kids down.
Gordon, I' m going to make this simple.
Some game?
Are you prepared to fire me over some kids?
Collect your personal belongings, Gordon.
Yes, sir, Mr. Ducksworth!
Thank you very much, Mr. Ducksworth!
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, Mr. Ducksworth!
- Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
You may have paid for this jersey, sir, but you didn' t earn it.
I' il see you in the play- offs.
There are some students here that I' d like to see.
I' m their hockey coach.
If you could tell me where I can find each of them, please.
They' re in room 223.
- All of them.
"I will not quack at the principal."
- People.
All of you.
Okay, don' t sit down.
Look, what' s done is done.
I want to be your coach again.
You' re gonna coach a bunch of losers?
- No, I want to coach the Ducks.
You said we didn' t deserve to live.
Do you know what that means?
- No.
- Okay, then you do.
I didn' t mean those things the way they sounded.
You guys know what it' s like to be misunderstood, right?
We' re kids.
- So...
Can I be your coach again?
- What about Banks?
- He can be on the team if he wants.
It' s you guys who were cheated.
- We' re a team, right?
- Yeah.
I made you guys, and I' m sticking with you.
So, what' s it gonna be?
We can play tomorrow night and still have a shot at the play- offs... or we can forfeit again and the season' s over.
Peter, what do you say?
Well...
All right.
- Yes.
You really quacked at the principal?
Are we Ducks, or what?
Wasn' t sure if you' d show up.
- I just want to play hockey.
Ducks, you all know Adam Banks.
On behalf of the Ducks, I' d like to say welcome.
Cake- eater.
Ooh, theJess- man, dissin' the new guy!
Shut up, Averman!
It' s just a joke.
Puttin 'on a Ducks jersey doesn' t mean you' re a real Duck.
- They' re a good group once you get to know 'em.
I' il see you on the ice.
Over here!
I' m open!
Come on, right here!
- Pass it to Banks!
Do somethin 'with it!
Way to go, Banks!
Goldberg, you' re gonna sit this one out.
You' re pulling the goalie when we' re tied?
A tie isn' t gonna help us.
We need the win.
Okay, Fulton, you' re our extra man.
Everybody, get the puck to Fulton.
- We pulling the Statue of Liberty play?
No, take your shot.
You may only get one, so it' s gotta be good.
- Soft hands, Fulton.
- Concentration, not strength.
Let' s get the Huskies!
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!
Shoot, Fulton, shoot!
We made the play- offs!
Guys, look, it' s the North Stars.
- Cool!
This is too cool.
I can' t believe this.
This place is humongous.
What are we doing here?
It' s a little play- offs present.
Hey, Gordo!
Gordon Bombay, right?
- You remember me?
- Sure, from Pee Wees.
- This guy used to rule in Pee Wees.
- I heard you were a farmer.
Actually, I became a lawyer.
But I' m coaching Pee Wee now and this is my team, the Ducks.
- Ducks, this is Basil McRae and Mike Modano.
- All right.
He knows what he' s talking about.
- Thanks.
Hey, nice seein 'ya.
All right, let' s have some fun! ~ You' ve got to accentuate the positive ~ ~Eliminate the negative ~ ~Latch on to the affirmative ~ ~Don' t mess with Mister In- between ~ ~ You' ve got to spread joy up to the maximum ~ ~Bring gloom down to that minimum ~ ~Have faith or pandemonium ~ ~ You' re liable to walk upon the sea ~ ~ To illustrate my last remark ~ ~ Talking aboutJonah in a whale and Noah in an ark ~ ~ What did they do when everything looked so dark ~ ~ Then they say ~ ~ You better accentuate the positive ~ ~Eliminate that negative ~ ~Latch on to the affirmative ~ ~Don' t mess with Mister In- between ~
You know, I heard the North Stars wore the same underwear... all through the play- offs last year for luck.
Hmm.
Maybe I should' ve cooked.
You know, I' m thinkin 'maybe we can all go down to the winter festival tonight.
- All three of us?
I don' t think I should, 'cause I got a lot of homework.
By yourselves.
Mmm, smells great!
Hello.
Go for it.
Hi.
Hmm, I wonder.
I used to sculpt, but now I do mostly paintings.
How do you think they do the details?
Oh.
I' m rambling on and on here.
You probably think I' m weird.
No, I think you' re great.
When I was a little girl, I used to pretend that that was an ice castle.
And that was my room, that window right up there.
What about me?
Which window' s mine?
I want to live there too.
What?
What did I say?
- It' s just not that easy.
- What' s not that easy?
Casey, I was just playin 'around.
I don' t even know how I feel about you.
But I do know there' s a little kid back home... who' s absolutely falling in love with his coach... and if you can' t deal with that, if you' re just playing around, then you better let me know.
- I have to decide on the first date?
- Stop it, Gordon.
Charlie' s gonna be there when we get back.
And ten years from now.
Look, I can take it.
But if Charlie gets too attached -
Every time this happens, it gets... a little rougher on him.
Just on him?
I' m glad to be here with you.
Me too.
The surprising Ducks are still in this game... against the Hornets.
He shoots, he scores!
It' s getting rough out there between the Ducks and the Hornets.
He stops, shoots.
Back it goes to Averman.
The ducks win it, 5- 3 over the Hornets.
And now it' s on to the semifinals... where the Ducks will face the Cardinals.
What a game so far, ladies and gentlemen!
Cardinals with it in their own zone, tryin' to clear it out.
Pass to the blue line, intercepted by the Ducks.
Right down the middle!
Steps around another defender!
Ducks with it again.
Here' s Averman, now getting it over to Banks.
He shoots, he scores!
Germaine put it off the goaltender' s glove into the net!
The Ducks have won!
Can you believe it?
4- 2, and the Ducks now get set to face the Hawks in the state finals.
Now, you miss this shot, you' re not just letting your team down, you' re letting me down too.
Remember, it' s not worth playing -
- That' s right.
- Let' s go!
All right!
Have we got a game for you today.
The Hawks, coached byJack Reilly.
Win, win, win, win, win!
Come on, let' s get fired up!
Quack, quack, quack, quack!
Hey, Banks.
Don' t forget what side you' re on.
He' il play like a Duck.
And the game is underway, and right off Larson and McGill with a heavy hit.
That gives you an indication of what you' re going to see tonight.
Good hit!
That' s the way I want you guys to play it!
The Ducks in green chasing it down against -
Keep it away from 'em!

All right, all right!
I want to see played all day, boys.
Larson stopped at the blue line, but the Ducks can' t clear it out.
He scores!
The Hawks lead late in the first period, 3- 0.
Don' t be scared of them, Ducks.
That' s what they want.
Keep your heads up.
Play proud.
Come on, let' s go!
Pressure, pressure!
I want him outta the game.
- Finish him off.
- Yeah.
Okay, boys, let' s go.
Face- off for the second period, and the Hawks win the draw.

Here' s Banks across the blue line!
Banks shoots!
He scores!
McGill knocked him down from behind, but Banks scored.
Adam, are you okay?
- What' d you do?
- My job.
He' s injured.
Oh, my God.
Come on, son, let' s go.
Number seven, McGill.
Two minutes.
Did it go in?
- Yeah, man.
- Jesse, do me a favour.
Kick some Hawk butt.
All right, cake- eater.
He' il be okay, sir.
We need to take some X rays, though.
Hell of a job, son.
We' re gonna get that one back.
You got somethin 'to say to me, Bombay?
To think I wasted all those years worrying about what you thought.
You' re goin 'down, Reilly.
Let me get 'em.
- No, we' re better than that.
- All right?
- Yeah.
All right.
We' re gonna hit 'em where it hurts the most: up there.
Fulton, you' re in.
- Coach, they' il be rushin 'him.
Jesse, make sure you give Fulton plenty of time.
- Jesse, do good.
- All right!
The Ducks trail 3- 1, and now they call on number 44, Fulton Reed...
Hall clears the front of the net.
Here' s Reed winding.
He scores!
Fulton Reed has scored, and the Ducks are back in the game!
Yes!
More fun!
More fun!
Of all the sloppy ass - Ladies, they don' t need our help out there!
Now I want that Fulton Reed covered.
You got it?
I' m tellin 'you, you blow this game and nobody makes the team next year!
Quick feet, now!
Blake through the slot with a backhand.
Blake with a backhanded goal, and the Hawks regain the two goal lead at 4- 2.
Guys, guys, guys, listen up, listen.
We have got to stay fired up and focused, all right?
It ain' t over 'til it' s over.
Tammy, Tommy, let' s show these Hawks something really different.
All right.
I want you guys to start up here -
Third period and the Ducks trail 4- 2, trying desperately to get back in the game.
The Ducks with Tammy and Tommy Duncan on the ice.
Tammy Duncan goes in front of the net, Tommy with the puck.
Tammy' s spinning, and the Hawks are just looking at her.
Now!
Tammy Duncan shoots, she scores!
We' re still alive!
I' m on, coach.
I' m off, coach.
He barely touched him.
Oreo line!
I want you to remember what we learned.
- Yeah!
- All right!
Let' s get a line change!
Flying "V"!
Here they come from behind the net!
It' s the flying "V"!
Terry Hall, with the puck, moves the puck ahead to brotherJesse.
Jesse Hall with it, trying to come down the slot.
Jesse scores!
With the score tied 4- 4, the next goal will decide the championship.
Neither team can afford any mistakes now.
23 seconds left to go in regulation.
Looking for the game- winning goal, here' s Morgan moving into the slot.
Big save, Goldberg!
We' il get 'em in overtime!
- Conway to centre ice on a breakaway!
He could win the game!
Where' s the call?
No time left on the clock, but the referee is calling a penalty shot!
What kind of call is that?
Okay, we' ve got a penalty shot for the Ducks.
Anyone on the ice can take it.
All right, Ducks, who' s gonna take it?
- I think he should take it.
- What about Charlie?
- All he does is fan.
- Coach, we have a chance to win.
- Damn straight we do.
Come here.
- Yeah.
- Then you' re all set.
You may make it, you may not.
But that doesn' t matter, Charlie.
Look around.
Whoever thought we' d make it this far?
Triple deke.
Take your best shot.
I believe in you, Charlie, win or lose.
- Go get 'em.
Okay, now wait for my signal.
Good luck.
Good luck.
Come on, Charlie.
Thank you, Hans.
I' m proud of you, Gordon. ~ We are the champions ~ ~No time for losers ~ ~ 'Cause we are the champions ~ ~ Of the world ~~
Look, don' t take any bad dives, okay?
Just remember, keep your head up, man.
Cake- eater.
Right.
Right.
Anything else?
Have fun out there, coach.
A tryout with the minors.
I' m gonna be goin 'up against kids half my age.
Just have a good tryout, Gordon.
Yeah, you' re right.
I' il call you when I get there.
No matter what happens, we' il see you next season.
We got a title to defend.
We can' t hold out much longer, sir.
[Hummel]
I won' t let you down, son.
How long do we have to wait?
I' ve lost 15 men already!
Sir, they' re lighting us up like a firestorm!
This is Gen. Hummel.
[Man # 1]
They' re not comin 'for us, are they, sir?
Congressman Weaver and esteemed members... of the Special Armed Services Committee...
I come before you to protest a grave injustice.
[Hummel]
It has to stop.
I miss you so much.
There' s somethin 'I' ve gotta do, Barb.
Somethin 'I couldn' t do while you were here.
I tried.
You know I tried everything, and I still don' t have their attention.
Let' s hope this elevates their thinking.
But whatever happens... please don' t think less of me.
[Men Panting, Grunting]
Marine! lnform the garrison C. O. that Gen. Hummel' s coming on board... with a security inspection team.
Sir, it' s an honor having you, sir.
I got the access card.
We got 30 minutes' til those darts wear off.
Move it!
The access card, sir.
Let' s do it.
2400 magazine check.
Man, it' s wet out there.
[Assailant]
Clear!
- I want 16, Major.
Move it!
Seal the door!
No, no, no!
Lemme outta here!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Lemme outta here!
God!
[Pained Gasping]
Please!
[Gurgling]
[Technician]
[Phone Ringing]
Thank you, Phil!
Why' d you get it sent here?
Carla' s right.
Why don' t you just spend $13. 00 on a CD, man?
First of all, it' s because I' m a Beatlemaniac.
- [Alarm Blaring]
Could be sarin gas.
Dog out at J. F. K. caught a whiff of something in this package... postmarked to a Bosnian refugee camp.
It could be detergent; it could be sarin gas.
Bosnian refugee camp?
Half a million Serbians reside in the U. S. Serbians don' t like Bosnians.
You guys wanna get suited up?
- Bring the cockroaches?
- Got 'em.
You' re all set to go.
October 1, 0900 hours.
Agent Stanley Goodspeed, Agent Trainee Marvin lsherwood... initiating exam of wooden crate.
Suspicion of sarin gas inside.
- Marvin, sarin is a -- - G. B. aerosol.
That is correct.
Kinky.
And, uh -- Not a good sign.
Helloo- oo- oo, little baby doll.
Lookit, Stan.
- Hi there, Stanley!
- Marvin, don' t!
Shit!
- Power landings offed.
We' il have that room cleared in 50 seconds.
Jesus Christ!
Okay, we' ve got some bad news and some really bad news.
The bad news is that the gas is corrosive and it' s eating our suits.
- It' s all over my hand, man.
- The really bad news... is there' s enough explosive and gas to blow the chamber and kill everybody...
- in the building.
- [Technician]
- Everybody, out of the room, now!
Where are the sprinklers, Lonner?
Shit.
Just wash us off.
Where are my sprinklers?
We' re working on it.
It' s just a flow problem.
We' re working on it!
- A minute ten.
- Hey, look at this!
- Tell 'em to take the atropine, now.
- The atropine, lsherwood.
- Where' s my water, Lonner?
Marvin, the atropine!
Shh- it!
- [Technician]
- Where' s that water?
- Get that away from me!
- Phil, fix it, for Christ' s sake!
- Take the atropine, for Christ' s sake!
- [Stanley]
- What the fuck are you waiting for?
- You take the fucking needle now!
- Fucking shit, oh fucking shit --
- Forty seconds!
lf you die, we all die! lnject your heart and then diffuse the bomb!
I can' t see shit!
Do it now!
- Look how big this is.
It' s coming.
Okay, here we go, man!
[Technician]
Sprinkler activated!
How much time left?
Twenty seconds.
- [Beeping]
- Fifteen.
[Whispering]
Oh, come on!
Clear!
Get me the fuck out of this gas chamber.
I almost stabbed myself in the heart with this thing!
- Stan?
- Hey, darlin '.
I had such an interesting day today.
Yeah, I had kind of an interesting day myself.
Okay, you go first.
Some terrorists decide to send a little care package -- box o 'goodies -- which had to be neutralized before blowing up the office.
I took the rest of the day off.
- Wow.
The world is being Fed- Ex' d to hell on a handcart.
I believe that anyone who' s thinking about having a child in this world... is coldly considering an act of cruelty.
I know, I' m rambling, I' m complaining, I' m sorry.
What' s your news, baby?
- I' m pregnant.
- I' m sorry?
I' m pregnant.
- [Chuckling]
- [Laughs]
- Yeah.
- Wow.
- You' re pregnant?
How do you know?
Blue.
Just turned blue, so I went to the doctor.
- Did you mean what you just said?
- When?
At the time?
Well... gosh, kind of a lot' s happened since then.
We' re not even married.
I know.
It' s funny you should mention that.
- It' s funny?
- Do you love me?
- Of course I love you.
- Good.
- Will you marry me?
- Whoa.
Marriage Police, pull over.
Come on, Stanley.
I' m proposing to you right now.
The Rock is the most famous and was the most feared prison ever built.
ls it really true that there' s never been an escape?
Ah, that' s true.
From 1936 until '63 when the prison closed... there were 14 attempts.
No one is believed to have made it to shore -- alive, at least.
I' m sorry, but tourists are not allowed back here.
- No.
Come here, fruity.
- Move!
- Hey, girls?
- [Girls Together]
Will you do something for me?
Tell your teacher that you need to get back on the boat and go home now.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Broadway!
This cell block housed... the most awesome scum in America.
Ladies and gentlemen, I, Ranger Bob... cordially invite you to become inmates of Alcatraz -- temporarily, of course.
On line!
Pretty tight quarters, aren' t they, huh?
Like being a caged animal.
Spend a couple of years in there --
- Something wrong with the tour?
- Tour' s over, Bob.
What kind of fucked- up tour is this?
Gen. Hummel, Captains Frye and Darrow reporting, sir.
Welcome to the Rock.
Land the choppers and deploy as planned.
I' m not allowed to carry a gun!
I got a goddamned gun!
Help!
Gentlemen, this' il be our new home.
I want my command center right here.
- I want coms up.
- Roger that, sir.
Let' s move it.
Possible penetration point in the shower room.
We' re setting anti- intrusion.
I brought a personal touch, sir.
It' s an antimotion trembler device.
It' s custom- made.
Nobody knows about it and nobody expects it.
- What' s it do?
- We head- fake 'em with the laser beam.
Then if they disturb Mr. Backup here, [Chuckles] we own 'em.
- [Tourists Screaming]
For that I apologize.
It is not our intention in any way to harm you.
[Major]
Attention on deck!
[Sighs]
Stand easy, men.
We are now in harm' s way.
For Major Baxter and I, this is the last campaign in a career dating back... to Tet '68.
Likewise for Captain Hendrix and Gunnery Sergeant Crisp... who cut their teeth under my command in Desert Storm.
Capt. Frye, Capt. Darrow, this is my first operational situation with you... and your men, and I have to say thus far your conduct reflects your reputations.
- Thank you, General.
- Thank you, sir.
We have achieved our position through poise, precision and audacity.
To this we must now add resolve.
We' il be branded as traitors, the gravest capital crime.
Punishable by death.
Two hundred years ago, a few guys named Washington, Jefferson and Adams... were branded as traitors by the British.
And now they' re called patriots.
ln time, so shall we.
God willing, in less than 48 hours we will evacuate this island in gunships... under cover of hostages and V. X. gas warheads.
Your destination: a nonextradition- treaty country.
You will each be paid a fee of $1 million for services rendered.
But you can never again set foot on your native soil.
- Can you live with that?
Yes, sir!
The men of Marine Force Recon are selected... to carry out illegal operations throughout the world.
When they don' t come home... their families are told fairy tales about what happened to them... and denied compensation.
Well, I have choked on these lies my entire career.
Well, here and now the lies stop!
God be with all of you.
Man your positions, men.
[Phone Ringing, Receiver Clanking]
This is FBl Director Womack.
Director... be advised... 81...
You are to take measures to assure this remains a need- to- know classified fact.
Who is this?
Mr. Director, you have a very serious problem.
A battery of V. X. gas rockets is presently deployed to deliver... a highly- lethal strike on the population of the San Francisco Bay area.
I will call again at 0100 hours to state my demands.
- I wanna know who I' m talking to.
- This is Brigadier General...
Out.
I' il cancel your reservations.
Get the Pentagon and call the San Francisco office.
It seems Alcatraz was just reopened.
[Man]
Last night, Gen. Hummel, using brutal but nonlethal force... under the guise of a security exercise... walked off with 15 V. X. poison- gas rockets.
That' s Gen. Hummel in Vietnam.
I think he was a major at the time.
Three tours in Vietnam, Panama, Grenada, Desert Storm...
Three Purple Hearts, two Silver Stars and the Congressional Medal of --
Jesus.
This man is a hero.
Well, now we can add kidnapping and extortion to his list of accolades.
Mr. Sinclair, Gen. Hummel is a man of honor.
General, it' s him.
- Frank, it' s Al Kramer.
- Hi, Al.
How ya doin '?
Why don' t you tell me?
There are a lot of very, very worried people here, Frank.
I' il come straight to the point.
83 Force Reconnaissance Marines have died under my various commands.
47 in Northern Laos and Southern China.
We never admitted we sent troops into China.
Who is this?
White House Chief of Staff Hayden Sinclair, General.
How old are you, Chief of Staff Sinclair?
- I' m 33.
- Well, Mr. Sinclair... you' ve probably got no fucking idea what I' m talking about.
By your ninth birthday, I was runnin 'black ops into China... and my men were responsible for over 200 enemy kills.
Now put some rigging tape over Mr. Sinclair' s mouth.
- He' s wasting my time.
- Ah, you want to continue, Frank?
Remember Operation Desert Storm?
Those surgical hits made by our smart bombs covered so well on CNN?
My men on the ground made those hits possible by lasing the targets.
No medals conferred.
These men died for their country, and they weren' t even given... a goddamn military burial.
The situation is unacceptable.
You will transfer $100 million from the Grand Cayman Red Sea Trading Company account... to an account I designate.
From these funds, reparations of $1 million will be paid... to each of the 83 marines' families.
The rest of the funds I will disperse at my discretion.
Do I make myself clear?
What is that?
- ldentify yourself.
- This is FBl Director Womack, General.
It' s a slush fund where the Pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.
Jesus, Frank!
You refuse payment, I launch the gas.
You and I know it doesn' t stand a chance.
- [Receiver Slams]
[Womack]
We have to identify the hostages and contact each of their families.
Tell 'em somethin'.
Make up a story, and we' ve got to keep this undercover.
lf this comes out, the city of San Francisco will be in chaos.
I am talking anarchy.
What is the potential casualty rate... for a single rocket armed with V. X. poison gas, Gen. Peterson?
Sixty or seventy.
Well, that' s -- that' s not so bad.
Seventy thousand dead.
- One teaspoon of this hits the floor... it' s lethal up to... 100 feet.
One teaspoon of this shit detonated in the atmosphere... will kill every living organism in an eight- block radius.
Get the point?
What did Hummel mean by your 'countermeasure,' General?
It burns it up, consumes it upon detonation.
The problem with V. X. poison gas... is that it' s designed specifically to withstand napalm.
That' s where thermite plasma comes in.
- Gen. Peterson?
- Thermite plasma incendiary systems... can burn hot enough to consume V. X., but they' re still in the test phase.
It' s not operational.
Hummel knows this.
We are dealing with one smart son of a bitch.
What' s it gonna take to equip a flight of F- 18s... with thermite plasma within the next 36 hours?
- Excuse me?
All right.
We can try.
But I strongly urge you to consider the use of this as a secondary initiative.
Then we have to go to our primary initiative.
- [Stanley]
- Oh, yeah.
- That' s very compelling.
Oh, yeah.
- Naughty, naughty -- - [Moans]
- This isn' t happening.
- No, Stan.
- This isn' t happening!
- No, just don' t answer it.
It' s okay.
- I have to.
They know I' m home.
- How could they know that you' re home?
- It' s the FBl.
[Ringing Stops, Receiver Clicks]
- No, you won' t.
- I have to go to San Francisco.
- No, you don' t.
Are you kidding me?
You need to stay here and talk to me about things.
- [Disgusted Groan]
I am Catholic.
Do you realize that?
I cannot believe you.
N- N- No.
- [Kissing Sounds]
I will marry you.
I just didn' t plan on this, that' s all.
- Really?
- I' m sure it' s just a training exercise.
Check into the hotel, order up some champagne --
- And we' il finish what we started?
- Baby, you gonna marry me?
- Just a really quick one.
Oh!
A nighttime airdrop incursion is out, due to the full moon.
Likewise a frontal seaside attack.
lf we' re compromised and shots are fired, Hummel might launch.
Our only alternative is an attack from within the prison.
We penetrate the island... through the tunnels under the prison buildings undetected... and emerge in its center, where we can jump the marines from behind... and if we' re lucky, take their rocket positions without a shot fired.
I don' t understand.
You' ve studied the architectural plans?
Alcatraz has been ripped up and rebuilt for years.
There' s no question.
We need firsthand intelligence of the tunnel systems.
- So what about the former warden?
- Died in 1979.
All the guards we contacted were useless.
Umm... there is someone who, I think, can help us.
This is for the sake of national security.
No, it' s the sake of national security... that got us here in the first place 33 years ago.
I knew -- I knew someday this would come back to bite us.
Forget it.
- He does not exist.
- He does exist!
We just forgot him for 30 years.
We locked him up and threw away the key.
Oh, and a lot of goddamn good it did us.
He broke out of two maximum security prisons, and if he hits the streets --
He' s not gonna 'hit the streets,' Jim!
Thirty years ago he was a highly- trained S. A. S. operative.
He is my age now, for Christ' s sake.
I have to get up three times a night to take a piss.
We can' t risk letting him out.
He' s a professional escape artist.
Neat, uh -- - Yeah.
- Dr. Goodspeed.
James Womack.
- Pleasure meeting you, sir.
- Welcome.
B. A., Columbia...
M. A., Ph. D., Johns Hopkins.
Biochemistry/ toxicology?
Well, I' m one of those fortunate people who like my job, sir.
Got my first chemistry set when I was seven.
We never saw the cat again.
[Chuckles]
- What do you know about V. X. gas?
Failed pesticide discovered by mistake in 1952.
It' s kind of like champagne that way.
The Franciscan monks thought... they were making white wine, somehow the bottle carbonated, voila, champagne.
- Then the whole thing -- - The gas, Dr. Goodspeed.
It' s very horrible, sir.
This isn' t a training exercise, is it?
No, Dr. Goodspeed, it' s not a training exercise.
- Ernest.
- Good morning, Director.
This is Ernest Paxton, agent in charge of the West Coast operation.
Dr. Goodspeed.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do, sir?
It' s been a fairly interesting day so far.
The prisoner' s here.
Shall we?
My boys haven' t been able to find a file on this guy.
Who is he, anyway, sir?
I was under the impression that no one escaped Alcatraz, sir.
[Womack]
This man has no identity... not in the United States or Great Britain.
Understand?
I want one thing:
[Man]
[Womack]
We' re prepared to offer him a full pardon.
And, Paxton, no strong- arming Mason.
I know him too well.
Well, if you know him, then why don' t you question him?
No, he' il remember me.
I don' t want his anger clouding the issue.
[Latch Clinking]
Mr. Mason, I' m special agent in charge Ernest Baxter.
Fucking me over for another three decades?
I don' t know anything about your previous matters.
I' m here because... a special situation exists that we feel you might be able to help us with.
Now, what might that be?
I' ve been in jail longer than Nelson Mandela... so maybe you want me to run for president.
- Ah, pity.
- Who?
- Alcamenes.
He was imprisoned by his king in ancient Greece.
Same fate.
- James the First.
- Even someone as bright as you... must be aware that, uh, there' s a certain pattern emerging here.
Alexander Solzhenitsyn?
Yeah, I heard of him.
Didn' t he play hockey for the fuckin 'Red Wings?
- That' s the chap.
- Get this straight, Pops.
I don' t like you any more than you like me.
But I' m here to make you a legitimate offer.
You wanna hear what I have to say or not?
By all means, dear Paxton, by all means.
We got a problem in a place that I think you know.
There' s a hostage situation on Alcatraz.
Hostage?
The Rock has become a tourist attraction?
Why don' t we cut the shit, huh?
You know the Rock.
You broke out.
- Yes, successfully.
So why don' t you do yourself a favor while you' re helpin 'us.
While you got a little lead left in your pencil?
While I' m considering your offer...
I want a suite at the Fairmont Hotel.
You know, I' m here to cut you a deal.
Here.
Here' s a quarter.
Do yourself a favor.
You' re goin 'back to jail.
- You' re sending him back to jail?
- I' m not sending him anywhere.
With all due respect, sir... we don' t have time for him to think about it.
- No, Goodspeed' s right.
- Me?
Sir, I' m not qualified for that.
- Yes.
- You' re an FBl agent.
- What is your specialty again?
- Chemical weapons.
- Don' t mention that!
- You want me to lie?
We got less than 24 hours.
Hiya!
I' m an agent with the, uh... eh, Federal -- FBl.
Uh -- Eh, well, my -- I' m Stanley Goodspeed.
- But of course you are.
- At least he got his name right.
- Of course I am.
- And you have an emergency.
- [Chair Thumps]
- Exactly right.
- [Exhales]
- Coffee.
No, no, I' m fine, thank you.
Offer me coffee.
Well, that was, in fact, going to be my next --
Could we get a cup of coffee in here, please?
And offer... to take these off.
Mr. Mason, really.
Prisoner requests to have his handcuffs taken off.
No, no, no!
Well, I guess that' s one way to go.
This is a pardon and release contract from the Attorney General' s office.
Now, it makes you a free man... provided you cooperate.
- uh, where it says -- - 'Signature'?
- That' s -- Yes.
'Signature.'
- Well... timeo Danaos et dona ferentis.
'I fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts.'
Oh, an educated man.
That rules out the possibility of you being a field agent.
ln point of fact, I am a field agent, Mr. Mason.
- Really.
- Yes.
- ln which field?
Then you' re trained in weaponry, explosives and mortal combat.
- [Slaps Table]
- Then it' s the Fairmont Hotel.
I want a suite... a shower, a shave... and the feel of a suit.
- May I also suggest a haircut.
- Am I out of style?
- [lnhales]
Call the Fairmont.
Close the floor if necessary... but I want him sealed off, and he gets two hours max.
Great job, Goodspeed.
[Paxton]
Why didn' t you throw in a trip to Tahiti?
No.
Give it to me, Reynolds.
Take Attorney Reynolds outside.
There' s a car waiting for you.
lsn' t that illegal?
You' re not acquainted with the full facts, Goodspeed.
With all due respect, sir, I' d like clarification.
I gave that man my word.
You' re on a need- to- know basis, and you don' t need to know!
It' s uh, eh, kind of curious, but, uh --
[Alarm Sounding]
Womack!
You piece of shit!
Peace!
- [Answering Machine Beeps]
- Hi, darling, it' s, uh, it' s me.
- come to San Francisco.
- Stanley, no!
Like hell I' m not comin '!
Carla!
Who' s Carla?
And why don' t you want her to come to San Francisco?
[Ringing Continues]
- You' re on a need- to- know basis, and you don' t need to know.
- [Agent]
- [Agents Laughing]
- Hmm?
- Well, where' s your issue?
I left it in my -- [Clears Throat] uh, my sock drawer.
[Scoffs]
For what?
You' re a chemical freak.
I' m a chemical super- freak, actually, but I still need a gun.
Give 'im a goddamn gun.
- [Woman]
Fairmont Hotel.
- Heh, uh, room service?
[Man]
- You the barber?
Stylist.
- [Buzzing]
- Just clippers, no scissors.
You' ve got to be kidding me, no scissors.
I mean, did they tell Picasso 'no brush'?
- With scissors, this man could kill you.
- I can' t cut... anyone' s balls off with a trimmer, now can l?
Why don' t we do this outside?
Who did this to you?
This is just not right. ln fact, it' s nasty.
- Well, it' s a... grunge thing.
- Well, it' s some kind of thing.
Do we have time for a sea kelp protein pack and maybe some color?
- No.
[Disgusted Sigh]
- Not very nice, is he?
- [Clippers Buzzing]
- We' re supposed to be on duty.
He' s an old man.
Come on.
Try some of this lobster.
- My secretary will settle the bill.
You' il get your life back, Mason.
But you could' ve given me my life back years ago.
- [Mason Grunts]
- [Womack Screaming]
- Freeze, mister!
Oh, man!
Help!
- Aaah!
Get!
- He' s gettin 'very heavy.
- Please don' t.
Shit!
- Yaah!
Help!
Help!
Help!
- Where' s Mason?
Where' s Mason?
- Hang on!
- Mason' s gone!
Clear!
He' s in the hotel!
I never saw you throw that gentleman off the balcony.
All I care about is, are you happy with your haircut?
Easy!
You' re gonna pull my arm out!
Hey!
- [Pedestrians Screaming]
Hey, call the guard!
Go!
FBl.
[Engine Revving, Tires Pealing]
- [Sirens Continue]
Whoa!
Get out of the way!
This guy' s hittin 'every fuckin' thing in sight tryin 'to block us!
I hope you' re insured!
- Oh, well, why not?
You' re goin 'down!
- Hello?
I' m only borrowing your Humvee!
lnformation?
Uh, Jade Angelou.
Whoa- oa!
We' re gonna crash!
Oh, no.
Oh, God!
You just fucked up your Ferrari.
- It' s not mine.
- [Chuckles, Grunts]
This sucks!
Where' s that son of a bitch at?
I' m gonna hunt him down!
That motherfucker ain' t safe nowhere!
Marvin, look up Wolfburg Federal Penitentiary.
The inmate is Mason, John.
I' m gettin 'out of this government shithole.
I' m goin 'over to Orkin to design Roach Motels.
Look, I just stole a kid' s motorcycle.
Yeah, I got it.
All right, Magrane, Masconi, Masters.
No Mason.
Go to February '76.
Who was transferred to Wolfburg from San Quentin?
- [Marvin]
Uh, wait a minute, wait a minute!
They have next of kin.
A Jade Angelou of 32 Stenson Drive, San Francisco.
Jade?
No, I' m Stacy, Jade' s Friend.
Were you afraid to come alone?
Yeah.
[Whispers]
I' il be over here if you need me.
Last photograph I had of you, you were about ten.
Well, uh --
- Why don' t we take a walk?
Palace of Fine Arts.
Your mother, uh -- [Sighs]
Yeah, she was.
Meeting in a bar after a Led Zeppelin concert.
Head out, and I was the result.
Well, I' d like to think it would' ve led somewhere, if only --
I' m sorry.
[Mason]
It' s all right.
- So they let you out?
- Yeah.
That' s good.
What did you do?
Jade, I don' t have a great deal of time here.
But I' il be coming back, and, uh...
- Maybe we can --- - What?
We can what?
You know... you' re almost the only evidence that I exist.
But I don' t know you.
That' s what I want to change, eh?
I' ve rehearsed this speech a thousand times on the chance that we would meet.
[Chuckles]
Well, I don' t know how I' m supposed to be feeling either.
Jade, I' m not an evil man.
Okay.
ls this about you?
You broke out of prison again, didn' t you?
- Why did you come to me?
- FBl, ma' am.
Your father' s working with us.
- He is?
- Yes, ma' am.
Well, gee whiz, John, I guess we oughta get goin ', huh?
Whatever you say, Stanley.
Thank you for that.
You could' ve handled it differently.
What do you say we cut the chitchat, a- hole?
You almost got me killed twice, and my jaw hurts like hell.
- Good.
lf I had my way, you would be shipped back to Wolfburg in leg irons... and caged like an animal for the rest of your natural fuckin 'life!
You wrecked half the city!
- [Man]
- Now, tell me about the tunnels.
All right, there' s an intake pipe here, below low tide. ls that our best access?
- Yes, that' s exactly where I came out.
There' s a connection to the abandoned septic system.
How many feet is that?
Ehh... 57 paces.
Where do we go from there?
[Muttering]
Where do you go from there?
- What?
No.
You' re not goddamn goin '.
Show us on the blueprints.
[Chuckles]
My blueprint was in my head.
I was underground for three days in the dark... just waiting for the tides to be right.
But don' t worry.
It' il all come back to me.
You' re not going anywhere, Mason.
Wait a second.
This piece of work might be the only chance those people over there have.
lf he' s not going, then why the hell did we get him out of jail?
- He' s smart.
- I got him out to get you people in, not go with you.
- then he goes.
- He' il fuck with you.
You compromise my men' s lives, and I' il bury you out there.
Now, Womack, you' re between the Rock and a hard case.
How' s your bowling arm?
Dr. Goodspeed, the goal is to take out the launchers... then neutralize the V. X. chemical rounds.
Well, we know the poison' s being kept in the prison morgue from the satellite thermal imaging... which is right here, these colorized dots.
Have you ever actually seen one of these devices?
No, sir, but I' ve studied them.
I should really begin briefing your guys on defusing and detoxification.
Got a really neat layout here of the chem round as well as the rocket, so let' s get rolling.
That won' t be necessary.
Oh, it' s very necessary, sir.
The power of this chemical is way beyond anything you can imagine.
An ecological disaster, sir.
Plus, the devices themselves are complicated.
That' s why you' re coming with us.
I am?
You' re the expert.
What' s your problem?
You mean I' m going -- going out there... under the water?
Earlier today you wanted a gun.
Now you' re getting a gun and a wet suit.
Have you ever been in a combat situation?
- Define 'combat,' sir.
- Shep?
Oh. ln that case, no, sir.
Excuse me.
[Retching]
[Gagging, Coughing]
[Gasping]
You don' t look too good.
ln fact, you look like shit.
My stomach' s doing hula hoops around my ass.
You all right?
I mean, you gonna make it through this thing?
I don' t know.
I always expected something like this was going to happen, but nothing prepares you for it.
[Faucet Creaks, Water Splashing]
- [Turns Faucet Off]
Remember, you were trained for this kind of situation.... and believe me, it' il come back to you.
Okay.
You' re right.
I' il be on the wire.
I' il help talk you through it.
There' s something else.
It' s terrible -- N- No, it' s wonderful... except it isn' t.
My girlfriend' s pregnant... and she' s... just flown in to see me.
- Hummel!
- Hello, Frank.
Lou Linstrom.
I' m at the White House with General Kramer.
Uh, Frank, we' re havin 'a few problems with the account transfer.
Don' t tell me problems, tell me solutions.
We' ve spoken to the president, and I know that you' re aware of his stance on terrorism...
- so what we' d like to do -- - This isn' t about terrorism.
This is about justice.
Well, let me tell you what is:
15 V. X. gas rockets into the heart of San Francisco.
You' ve got 17 hours to deliver the money.
Or be prepared to reap the whirlwind, gentlemen.
What' s the word from Mojave?
General Peterson can give us no definite assurance on the thermite plasma.
That is the word.
Green light to SEAL incursion.
All right.
Listen up.
Lieutenant Shepard will be attached to his hip.
You breathe, he breathes with you.
You piss, he helps.
Understood?
Dr. Goodspeed is our specialist.
When he neutralizes the threat, we launch green flares and we wait for the cavalry.
Make no mistake, gentlemen, we' re in the fight of our lives... against maybe the greatest battalion commander... in the Vietnam War, I shit you not.
Any questions?
Let' s load up!
After you, ace.
Pass out and activate the Minicams.
Everything set here?
Minicams operational?
Roger that, sir.
We are on line.
Shep, what' s the status on the special operational gear for Mr. Mason?
Let' s see, we have, uh... one quart of kerosene and a squeeze bottle... three washers and waterproof matches.
Now, this is atropine.
lf you come in contact with the gas... you have 20 seconds to inject it into your heart.
Don' t fuck with me on this.
I have three incoming bogeys bearing 2- 7- 5.
6, 000 meters.
FBl Command Center?
- Oh, I would just love for you to tell me what is goin 'on.
- Nope.
Listen, Stanley Goodspeed is my boyfriend.
Where is he?
- Classified, lady.
Okay, well you just sit here and act like a Bureau bonehead, then.
Hey, where are you -- Goddamn it.
Decoy choppers commencing run to Alcatraz.
I just lost one, sir.
We only got two flying in.
I just lost one.
ln my day, we did it all with a snorkel and a pair of flippers.
- Your day?
- Yes, didn' t you read my resume?
I don' t -- I don' t know anything about you.
- I know something about you, Godspell.
- Goodspeed.
Goodspeed, Godspeed, Godspell, you never went to any anti- terrorist school.
So just make sure you don' t get us all fucking killed.
We' re going dark.
Night vision!
Raider One has dropped below radar coverage... heading around Treasure lsland.
Sir, we' ve got two bogeys bearing due east and closing.
Decoys?
- Prepare to deploy!
- Good luck, Commander.
Sir, Raider One is at the drop zone.
Stanley' s not a very good swimmer.
- Everyone, good to go?
- Good to go!
- Good to go!
Good to go!
So the S. D. U. s have been deployed, and the Eagles are in the water.
Major, I want the perimeter patrolled to the west end of the island.
- Yes, sir.
Hendrix, lead the patrol.
- Aye, sir.
Let' s move!
Move out, move out, move out!
The Eagles are on the rock.
They' ve entered the cistern room.
Thank you very fucking much, Mr. Mason.
You sent us into a room with no exit.
Any ideas, Dillinger?
We' re sitting ducks.
- Real tight on time.
Until I open it.
I' d like to know how you plan on accomplishing that.
Through here.
- You' re shitting me.
- I memorized the timing.
I just hope it hasn' t been changed.
- You catch one of those flame bursts, you' re a corpse.
- Thank you.
- Commander, you said never leave his side, but, uh -- - Stand fast, Lieutenant.
Have a nice day.
- Where' d you dig up this guy?
- That' s classified.
No motion sensors tripped.
Nothing.
Well, tell them to stay out there.
Sweep forward!
Looks like he fucked us, Commander.
That son of a bitch jumped ship.
Welcome to the Rock.
Mason.
That' s a no- no.
That' s the subway.
You enjoying this?
Well, it' s certainly more enjoyable than my average day: reading philosophy, avoiding gang rape in the washroom.
Though it' s less of a problem these days.
Maybe I' m losing my sex appeal.
We' ve got seismic activity in one of the storm grates.
Continue patrolling the area.
Sweep forward.
Commander, halt.
We' ve got movement.
They' re hearing sounds above, sir.
Stand fast.
Down, down, down.
West storm drain' s clear.
Ninety- seven paces to the shower room.
They' re under the shower room, sir.
Fiber optics.
Something' s not right.
I' ve got a bad feeling about this.
Quiet.
Motion sensors.
- Beams cutting across manhole covers.
- Deal with it.
Commander, the beam is hitting some sort of reflective device.
I want to use a mirror to cut the beam... send the beam back to its source... and then I' m going to move the prism.
[Electronic Beeping]
We' ve got motion on a trembler in the shower room, sir.
We' ve got visitors.
Let' s move.
Got it.
Good to go.
Stand fast.
We' il secure the area.
They' re entering to the shower room, sir.
They' re securing the area.
Just sit tight.
Drop your weapons!
Drop 'em!
- Hold your fire.
Drop your weapons.
Hold your fire!
It' s a fucking trap.
This is Gen. Hummel.
Drop your weapons.
Drop 'em!
Anderson here, Gen. Hummel.
Team leader.
Cmdr. Anderson, if you have any concern for the lives of your men... you will order them to safety their weapons and place them on the deck.
This is not happening.
Sir, we know why you' re out here.
God knows I agree with you.
But like you, I swore to defend this country against all enemies... foreign, sir, and domestic.
General, we' ve spilled the same blood in the same mud.
You know goddamn well I can' t give that order.
We' re dead.
Your unit is covered from an elevated position, Commander.
I' m not gonna ask again.
Don' t do anything stupid.
No one has to die here.
Men following the general, you' re under oath as United States Marines!
Have you forgotten that?
Some of them were shit on and pissed on by the Pentagon.
But that doesn' t give you the right to mutiny!
You call it what you want!
You' re down there; we' re up here.
- Stand fast!
- Commander, one last time.
- I cannot give that order!
- I am not gonna repeat that order!
- I will not give that order!
- What the hell is wrong with you, man?
- Oh, my God!
- One last time.
You order your men to safety their weapons -- [Screaming]
Don' t go.
[Screaming]
Shit.
Let go of me.
Let go of me!
It' s over.
Oh, God!
- We got some movement.
Who is it?
- Two of 'em.
It' s Goodspeed and Mason.
I knew it.
I' ve gotta get a team together.
What, and invite another massacre?
We' ve got a 60- year- old convict and a lab rat.
I' m telling you, it' s over.
Not for Mason it isn' t.
Goodspeed, I' m not gonna kill you.
- Where are you going?
What?
[Man On Radio]
Goodspeed, do you read me?
It' s for you.
- Sir?
- What' s the status?
They' re dead!
It' s just me and Mason.
Now he says he' s leaving.
That is unacceptable, do you hear me?
He' s got a gun.
What do you have, a fuckin 'water pistol?
- No, sir.
- Go after him and stop him.
Jesus, I didn' t want this.
- We knew this might happen.
- Maybe now they' il pay up.
- Maybe now they won' t, Captain.
- Maybe we need to execute a few hostages.
- Got a live one!
- Put a bullet in him.
You heard him, end it.
Holster that sidearm, Captain!
Sir?
You made a terrible mistake.
And more of our brothers have died in vain.
Damn you for forcing me into this position.
I need to talk to you.
Right now, alone.
Now you told me I' m on a need- to- know basis... and I' m tellin 'you right now I need to know who the fuck John Mason is right now, sir.
All right, you wanna know?
1962, J. Edgar Hoover... is head of the FBl, some say the country.
It' s no secret he kept microfilm files on prominent Americans and Europeans: de Gaulle, British members of Parliament, even the prime minister.
I mean, this guy had dirt on everybody in the world.
Yeah.
I know all the cloak- and- dagger stories.
Where does Mason fit in?
Mason was the British operative who stole the files.
But our Bureau agents caught him at the Canadian border.
Of course, the British claimed they' d never heard of him.
And we held him without trial until he gave up the microfilm.
But he never did.
I' m surprised Hoover didn' t use his daughter as leverage.
Hoover was dead in '72.
She wasn' t born yet.
Today, well, it' s a different bureau.
So you held this guy without trial his whole life.
No wonder he' s pissed.
This man knows our most intimate secrets from the last half- century: the alien landing at Roswell, the truth about the J. F. K. assassination.
And Mason' s angry, he' s lethal.
He' s a trained killer.
And he is the only hope that we have got.
Mason!
Like me.
You wanna play tough?
You wanna play tough with me?
Okay, FBl!
Freeze, sucker!
- I' il fire.
- No, you won' t.
- Throw down.
- You' re not the sort.
Let' s find out.
I could; you, no.
Besides, your safety' s on.
Goodspeed, have you resolved the situation?
Not yet.
He' s got all the guns now, sir.
You' re right.
This is what I do.
I haven' t got my glasses.
What it says is, 'Chemical Weapons Specialist.'
That' s right.
I got a lunatic up there, man, with 15 missiles... armed with some really funky stuff.
That lying Womack.
You could' ve told my daughter.
It was classified.
Look, I' m in the same situation.
They' ve got my girlfriend in the city with a baby on the way.
Look, I can defuse the rockets.
But I' m gonna need your help, and I' m gonna need it right now.
Sir, this man' s weapons and tack radio are missing!
Shit, we got a rodent problem.
Flush the pipes.
There' s probably a maze of tunnels on this goddamn island.
Check every access you can find.
Even if you escape from the island... you can' t escape the rockets.
So, where are you gonna go?
What' re you gonna do?
Show me where the morgue is, Mason.
[Mason]
I' m out of here.
[Stanley]
What about your daughter?
Mason?
I don' t think you do.
Move!
They' re on to us.
Burn 'em out.
I don' t understand.
How could we lose radio contact all of a sudden?
Still got 'em on locaters.
- So what' s it gonna be?
- What?
- How do you like your choices?
- I don' t.
- That' s what I thought.
- Come on.
This is the oldest part of Alcatraz.
Did you know it was originally a Civil War fort?
Oh, really?
Yeah, wow.
You know, I like history, too... and maybe when this is over, you and I can stop by the souvenir shop together... but right now, I just -- I just -- I wanna find some rockets.
Don' t tempt me.
We are going to the morgue.
- You sure you' re ready for this?
- I' il do my best.
Your best?
Losers always whine about their best.
Winners go home and fuck the prom queen.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Locaters have them approaching the morgue, sir.
Come on, come on, you can do it, Doc.
You must never hesitate.
I think you' re shooting too close to the rocket.
Him, but not the rocket.
Any other news, professor?
The rocket!
Not the rocket!
I got a little something for ya.
Mason... the second you don' t respect this, it kills you.
Put it over there.
You' ve been around a lot of corpses. ls that normal?
- What, the feet thing?
- Yeah, the feet thing.
- Yeah, that happens.
- Can you do something about it?
Kill him again?
Listen, I' m just a biochemist.
Most of the time, I work in a glass jar and lead a very uneventful life.
I drive a Volvo, a beige one.
[Hissing]
A really elegant string- of- pearls configuration.
Unfortunately, incredibly unstable.
What exactly does this stuff do?
lf the rocket renders it aerosol, it can take out the entire city of people.
Really?
What happens if you drop one?
Happily, it' il just wipe out you and me.
- How?
It stops the brain from sending nerve messages down the spinal cord within 30 seconds.
Any epidermal exposure or inhalation, and you' il know.
A twinge at the small of your back as the poison seizes your nervous system.
Do not move that!
Your muscles freeze, you can' t breathe... you spasm so hard you break your own back, spit your guts out.
But that' s after your skin melts off.
My God.
Well, I think we' d like God on our side at the moment, don' t you?
So what I' m doing now is removing the guidance system chips... so the rocket' il splash down after 500 feet.
You can let go of it.
Just back away!
Sir, morgue team has not checked in.
Blackbird One, it' s Blackbird, over.
Blackbird One, this is Blackbird, come in, goddamn it!
Somebody' s still there.
Let' s move!
Rats alive!
Close on the morgue!
Close on the morgue!
Frye, Darrow, hustle up.
We got more company!
Converge on the morgue!
Goodspeed, come on.
Come over here.
Yeah, I love pressure, I eat it for breakfast.
Come on.
Clear!
I' m too old for this!
- Where' s it go?
- I' ve no idea.
Sir, all the guidance chips are gone.
Captain, I guess you didn' t quite take care of the rat problem.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir!
- You really don' t know where this goes?
- No, I don' t know where it goes.
Do you know how to slow it down?
No, I don' t.
Mason!
You all right?
Yes, perfectly okay, you fucking idiot.
They' re coming.
- Who?
- The marines!
Where?
- What the fuck' s goin 'on?
Mason!
Mason!
[Grunting]
How do you do it?
Oh, I was trained by the best.
Come on.
But in retrospect, I' d rather have been a poet or a farmer.
Okay.
Okay, the president arrives in three hours.
What' s the word from Mojave, General?
Same as last time, Lou.
They' re going as fast as they can.
Do it over here.
On your knees!
You' ve got something that belongs to me.
Speak up.
[Panting]
- Speak up!
- Oh!
- Uh -- - Tell them your name.
My name is Larry Henderson.
Oh, man.
And I' m a father of three, and, uh... they' ve got a gun to my head.
You' ve got exactly three minutes to return the guidance chips... or Mr. Henderson won' t have a head.
Oh, no.
You find them and defuse them.
I' il try and delay Hummel and give you more time.
Hey, what about Mr. Henderson' s head?
Okay.
What do you mean?
General.
Who the hell are you?
I' m all that' s left of the enemy.
Bingo.
Stand easy.
Thought I' d been in the service a long time.
Name and rank, sailor.
It' s Army, actually.
And address him as' General, sir. '
Captain John Patrick Mason, General, sir.... of Her Majesty' s S. A. S.
Retired, of course.
You' re a long way from home, Captain.
How the hell are you involved in this?
I have a unique knowledge of this prison facility.
I was, uh... formerly a guest here.
Hi, sweetie.
Hey, come back here, little boy.
Did they bother to tell you who I am, why I' m doing this... or are they just using you like they do everybody else?
All I know is you were big in Vietnam.
I saw the highlights on television.
You wouldn' t have any idea what it means to lead the finest men on God' s earth into battle... and then see their memory betrayed by their own fuckin 'government!
I don' t quite see how you cherish the memory of the dead by killing another million.
And, uh... this is not combat.
It' s an act of lunacy, General, sir.
Personally, I think you' re a fuckin 'idiot.
'with the blood of patriots and tyrants.'
Thomas Jefferson.
'Patriotism is the virtue of the vicious,' according to Oscar Wilde.
Thank you for making my point.
Where are the guidance chips?
Where are the guidance chips!
I destroyed them.
That was a bad move, soldier.
Does that mean you' il execute us both?
[Rapid Gunfire]
[Screams, Grunts]
'Cause I' d take pleasure in guttin' you, boy.
[Stanley]
I' d take pleasure in guttin 'you... boy.
Boy.
What is wrong with these people, huh, Mason?
Don' t you think there' s a lot of anger floatin 'around this island?
Kind of a pubescent volatility?
A lot of angst, lot of 'I' m 16, I' m angry at my father' syndrome?
I mean, grow up!
We' re stuck on an island... with a bunch of violence- for- pleasure- seeking psychopathic marines.
Shame on them!
[Clears Throat]
Mason?
Yes, I' m here.
I was just thinking how wonderful it was... when the inmates weren' t allowed to talk in here.
Not allowed to talk.
How did you do it?
[Sighs]
Nurtured the hope that there was hope... that one day I' d breathe free air.
Perhaps meet my daughter.
Modest hopes, but they kept a man alive.
What did they put you away for, John?
Oh, that' s a long story.
Well, I' m not going anywhere.
When was the last communication from our men on Alcatraz?
Seven hours.
- [Phone Rings]
- Thermite plasma is operational.
Be seated.
Gentlemen, consider yourselves on ground alert.
lf we receive launch authority, your mission: the complete thermal destruction of Alcatraz lsland.
The entire island is to be blanketed, not one square inch missed.
Eighty- one American civilians and a number of U. S. Marines will lose their lives.
[Chuckles]
The moment they had the microfilm, they' d suicide me.
- Some solution.
- You ended up here.
Which brings me to another question.
You broke out -- let me see if I can get this straight -- you went down the incinerator chute, on the mine car... through the tunnels to the power plant... under the steam engine -- that was really cool, by the way -- and into the cistern through the intake pipe... [Clears Throat] but how, in the name of Zeus' s butthole... did you get out of your cell?
I only ask because in our current situation... well, it could prove to be useful information, maybe!
Trade secrets, my son.
Wow.
General, two operational rockets left.
One at the lower lighthouse and one at the roof.
Both of the birds are ready to fly, sir.
General, can you hear me?
- I heard you, Captain.
- Just makin 'sure.
Should we... prepare for launch, General?
I' il handle the strategy, Captain.
The hour is approaching.
Just letting the General know of the time, sir.
I' m very aware of the time, Captain.
Aye, aye, sir.
Lettin 'you know.
Mason, where are you going?
You' re not leaving!
Shhh.
Some sniper' s gonna get his ass.
Stop moving, Mason.
Mason, stop moving.
Hummel won' t do it.
He' s a soldier, not a murderer.
I read it in his eyes.
Read his eyes?
Oh, well, then everything' s just fine!
- I can' t afford to take that chance.
- Why don' t you talk louder?
- They' re not gonna call for it.
- Oh, they' il call.
Sir.
- Hi, Frank, it' s Al Kramer here.
- How' s it going out there?
- How do you think it' s going?
- We' re gonna need another hour, Frank.
- You' ve got three minutes.
- We have to get authorization from the president.
- You' ve got three minutes.
Frank, please don' t do anything stupid.
They want another hour.
That' s bullshit.
They' re lying.
They' re calling our bluff, sir.
They' re playing you for a fool.
Sir, order the launch, General.
Come on, General, let' s be all we can be.
The mission' s not complete!
Well, mine is.
When this is over, you' il go back home... driving Carla and your baby insane in your beige Volvo.
And I' il be dead, or back in prison, which is the same thing.
You' re not leaving.
[Grunts, Groaning]
I got three weeks' weapons training.
I' il kick the -- out of a platoon full of marines.
No problem.
Major, patch me into roof battery.
Laser powered up.
Oh, no.
I said, on your knees!
My name' s Stanley Goodspeed.
- What?
- Glass or plastic!
- Shut the fuck up!
Shut up!
And you' re gonna end up in either a glass jar or a plastic bag.
So do the math, hand over the gun and let' s go find some rockets!
[Panting]
You made the right choice.
I decided I didn' t want your child growing up without a father.
So I' m fucked either way.
So come on.
The weapon is hot.
Man, killing Navy SEALs is one thing -- ls this for real?
Hey, it' s business.
Access code entered.
Launch coordinates: six, seven, five, four, five, niner.
The weapon is hot.
I' m standing by for launch command.
It' s affirmative.
[Bell Chiming]
Standing by for command.
- Fire.
- Fire!
Missile loose!
Alcatraz, 67253725.
What' s the heading?
Heading 185 degrees south southeast.
- Speed?
It' s headed right at Oakland.
The football game.
Oh, my God.
Missile radically changing direction.
275 degrees west.
It' s headed out to sea, sir.
Oh, Christ!
Missile losing altitude.
Falling, 300 feet, 200, 100.
Bogey detonated under water.
What the fuck?
- It missed.
- Well, that' s great.
What happened to the rocket?
What happened to the coordinates?
Sir!
Captain, step outside.
- Talk to me, sir.
- Captain, step outside!
Get me the Pentagon.
What the hell was that, Frank?
- I said, what the hell -- - I heard what you said!
- What the hell are you doing?
- I' m not ready to kill these people.
- Call the Pentagon.
- No.
We' re coming loose.
You' re coming loose.
The rest of us are in complete control.
- We' re gonna ask for a new deadline.
- The men are falling apart!
- The men are marines!
- Are they?
I wanna talk to Gen. Kramer.
- You' ve been asked by an old friend.
- You' ve been ordered.
- This is Major Baxter!
Put the phone down.
I thought you weren' t ready to kill.
I' m warming up.
They need a decision, Mr. President.
These past few hours... have been the longest, darkest of my life.
How does one weigh human life?
One million civilians against 81 hostages.
And in the middle, Frank Hummel.
That we have ignored, abandoned... or marginalized a great soldier like Frank Hummel... and American boys have paid for that neglect... with blood is equally real... and equally tragic.
We are at war with terror... and fighting war means casualties.
This is the worst call I' ve ever had to make.
Air strike approved.
Request clearance.
The amount of firepower they' re gonna drop in there...
This is strike leader.
[Pilot]
Flight time to drop point:
17 minutes.
Excuse me, General, sir, with all due respect to you, but what the fuck is going on?
- You changed the coordinates, didn' t you, General?
- That' s affirmative, Captain.
Now they think we' re gutless, the Feds?
They' re gonna come at us with everything they got.
They don' t know we missed on purpose.
Great.
We' re incompetent.
That right?
I don' t think I like your tone, Captain.
Load the V. X. into the choppers, take four hostages and evacuate.
The consequences of our actions I' il face alone.
Excuse me, General, but what about the fucking money?
There is no fucking money.
Mission' s over.
Bullshit it' s over.
You' re talking to a General, soldier!
I' m not a soldier, Major.
The day we took hostages we became mercenaries.
And mercenaries get paid.
I want my fucking money!
This mission was based on the threat of force.
I' m not about to kill 80, 000 innocent people.
Do you think I' m out of my fucking mind?
They called it.
Who ever said anything about bluffing, General?
Stand down, Captain.
Stand down, Captain!
Major, I' m ordering you to take these men to the choppers and evacuate.
That' s a simple order, Major!
It' s not so simple, Frank.
Sgt. Crisp, secure the general.
I' m relieving you of your command, sir.
Sergeant!
- I' il have that sidearm, sir.
- You mean this sidearm?
Maj. Baxter, you' re either with us or against us.
It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve with you, General.
But like he said... it' s over.
[Grunts]
Mason!
My God, what have I done?
Where' s the last rocket?
Where' s the last rocket?
- Where' s the last rocket?
- Lower lighthouse!
I' il take care of this fucker!
One, two, three!
Eat that!
[Groaning]
Come here.
Come here, you little chickensh --
We' re both dead.
Come on.
- Com on.
- You know how this shit works?
Come on.
I don' t need a gun.
I' il put it down.
Let' s play.
Stan Goodspeed, FBl.
Do you like the Elton John song, 'Rocket Man'?
- I don' t like soft- ass shit.
[Screaming]
[Screaming Continues]
Open up!
[Grunting]
Okay.
Got ya.
I got you, baby.
[Grunting]
Red Thunder strike leader.
Time on target: seven minutes.
[Grunting]
English prick.
I tell you my old man was lrish?
[Grunting]
- Aw, fuck!
It' s me and you, pal!
I want that fucking chip!
I know you' re in here, and I know you can hear me.
Now pay the piper and come out like a man.
[Grunting Continues]
You motherfucker!
[Yelling]
I' m gonna choke my million bucks out of you!
You' re gonna die!
- Eat that, you fucker!
Time on target:
60 seconds.
[Anderson' s Voice]
When he neutralizes the threat... we launch green flares and we wait for the cavalry.
Let' s tighten up that formation.
May God have mercy on your souls.
Please don' t let this happen.
Please.
[Grunting, Groaning]
[Groans]
Master arm.
Time on target:
12 seconds.
- T. O. T.: ten seconds.
I got green smoke!
We have green smoke, over!
Abort!
- Abort!
- [Screaming]
Let me through, please.
The cells did not get hit.
- [Grunting, Gasping]
- I' m fed up saving your ass.
I' m amazed you ever got past puberty.
I suppose all this will make a great bedtime story to tell your kid.
You' re insane, Mason.
I' il spend all my money on shrinks.
Goodspeed, come in.
Goodspeed, do you read me?
Scanning all radio frequencies.
Goodspeed, do you read me?
Goodspeed, do you read me?
Do you read me?
Come in.
This is Goodspeed.
Every one of 'em.
[Cheering]
Goodspeed, it' s Womack.
What about Mason?
He' s dead, sir.
When?
- Just come and get me.
Womack tore up your pardon, John.
[Chuckles]
I knew he would.
The S. D. U. s and the scuba gear should still be where we came ashore.
lf you can get to the Pan Pacific Hotel... there' s clothes in my closet and $200 in the Bible.
Room 26.
It' s been a long time since I' ve said thank you to anybody.
But thank you.
Well, Stanley, this is when we go our separate ways, huh?
Uh -- I' m sure you know the etymology of your name, 'Goodspeed.'
Why?
Well, if you fancy a journey...
I recommend Fort Walton, Kansas.
I was thinking of Maui.
No.
Forget Maui.
'St. Michael' s Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.
'Front pew, right leg.
Hollow. '
ls this what I think it is?
Mason?
Congratulations, Dr. Goodspeed.
Thank you, sir.
You know, for a while there, I didn' t think you were gonna make it.
Well done, son.
So, where' s Mason?
Blown out to sea.
Blown out to sea, huh?
Poor bastard.
Goodspeed, where' s Mason?
Where' s his body?
I wanna see that son of a bitch.
Vaporized, sir.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
What?
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely, sir.
St. Michael' s Church.
[Man Shouting]
Vandals!
Vandals!
- Stop!
Vandals!
- I' m sorry.
- Come on, baby!
- I' ve got it.
- Stop!
- Sorry!
- Vandals!
- [Panting]
Honey, uh, do you wanna know who really killed J. F. K.?
- How fast?
Incredible!
Another record before I leave!
Keep the stopwatch I don' t need it.
Speech!
Speech!
Where is my little Daniel?
As you all know Daniel resigned last night
He quits the 2 wheelers for the 4 wheelers
He follows the reverse human evolution that starts on all fours,...... and finishes on its 2 wheels!
I want him to know he was the best of all of us,...... and most of all, a very good friend.
You going be missed by all of us you know.
Or did your lips just slip?
It' s not that I didn' t like it but I don' t know what to think anymore.
Is it clearer now?
Because if it slipped again, you must be really clumsy.
And now to celebrate Daniel' s departure...... I announce the big parade!
Open your eyes wide, Lily, because you won' t see this again in your life.
- How many are there?
- A lot.
These are the best.
Go for it!
Holy shit!
Excellent!
- So having a little party?
- Are they from the pizzeria?
- Sorry but we would like to see your papers.
I' m sorry we left them inside if you want we can go get them now.
- Ok but make it fast.
- No problem, thanks.
Let' s run!.
It must have been 5 minutes now.
- Watch out there could be some oil.
Yeah, it' s my apartment but it' s also kind of a garage.
I hope that...
Hmm, it' s... different.
We' ve known each other for two years now.
why did you wait until the day you quit to show me your apartment?
- I take a long time to decide.
Your cleavage.
It' s nice, eh?
The dress is brand new.
Ok then we' il try not to damage it.
Are you sure it' s okay after all these years of friendship?
We prepared the ground well, it' s time to build on it.
- Maybe we could wait a little bit more.
- No, If I wait more,...... I' m worried that you' il take it badly and I don' t want to be rude.
- Oh, no.
- What?
- But it' s Saturday.
- Yes, but I have to go to work.
You just stopped working last night, you didn' t find a job during the night, did you?
No, it' s for my future job...... a kind of meeting I booked a long time ago.
I thought you were waiting for our meeting for a long time.
Yes, a long time plus an hour.
And when I say 1 hour, that' s the maximum.
Hey blue, you take a number over there.
Don' t forget your photos next time.
247.
It' s not even close to my number.
- 25 years yesterday.
It' s the first morning I can my newspaper calmly in the last 25 years.
I' m here!
Your paper, 2 pictures... sign here... and here.
Professional Licence, traffic certificate,...... acquisition autorisation, the notebook, the plates and the sign.
- That' s all?
- Yes.
- Nothing more after 6 years?
- You want me to sing the national anthem?
No, not really but a smile would have been nice.
248!
Lily!
It' s 12: 00, I went to buy some croissants...... and in the meantime I married the baker.
Goodbye and so long.
You' re welcome.
No, we insist.
- Hey, Paulo!
- Yes.
Your party was great we drank like crazy.
- What' s wrong?
I use super- unleaded.
I just outran 2 cops, you should have seen it.
Ok I' il tell you, 2 police on bikes on the street.
When they shifted into first, I was already on the beach.
They were furious.
Los dejé atrás a toda velocidad, no podían creerlo.
Those 2 won' t forget Paulo that easily.
I assure you they did not forget you, Paulo.
Hey Girls.
Still wearing the moustache!?
Today it' s free.
Coming?
Hey are you a "taxi", or a nice taxi?
The driver is really nice.
- And he carries the bags if asked nicely.
- Thank you, perfect.
And where are we going, miss?
You see the pink house over there, with a big door?
- Yes, I see it.
- That' s where we' re going.
Do you prefer a route in particular?
Put all that in the kitchen, I' il organise it later.
- You have enough food for a week there.
- Oh no, my son is coming for lunch.
- No.
Sunday he prepares...... all his meals for the week,
His apartment is so small there' s no kitchen.
Look.
That' s him in the picture.
He works at IBM.
- Everybody has their thing.
What is your "thing"?
I love driving, but you probably didn' t have time to see it!
My son is taking his driving exam for the 8th time.
8 times!
8 is my lucky number it will be good for him.
To the left, Mr. Carbadec.
To the left, to the left!
Are you nuts?
Jesus Christ!
I' ve never seen such an idiot in the 10 years I' ve worked here!
Can' t you tell right from left?
- Should I have sent a sax?
LEFT LEFT!
It' s no so difficult to turn a steering wheel and press a pedal!
- Everyone has their strengths.
- And you what is your job?
Where they hell do they hire idiots like that?
- In a circus, in a zoo, the government or what?
A little bit of all three.
- Ah you should have said it earlier.
- Should I have sent a Fax?
Can I offer you something, inspector?
Thanks you.
You' re so nice, I' m going to keep your card.
I don' t want to be rude but I need to go work, Is it ok if I eat in the Taxi?
Of course, go ahead.
Go Work!
- Can you save my life?
- In theory, no.
It depends on your symptoms.
I have a flight in 25 minutes.
If I miss it I' m a dead man.
If I catch it, you' re a rich man.
Hmm... the gentleman is lucky.
I' m no doctor,...... but I really like emergencies.
Maybe we should go now.
Here we go.
A white taxi moving really fast!
- He knocked down my radar!
- We' il care of it - got his plate number?
- I didn' t have the time it was too fast.
- Open your eyes, it' s your job.
Do you think we' re going to make it on time?
Because if we' re going to miss it maybe we should take our time.
It' il be ok, we' re going slow now, but on the highway we' il speed up.
I don' t want you to lose your license.
No problem, I don' t have a license.
Fantastic.
14 minutes and 30 seconds.
Leaves you time to read the paper and maybe a cup of coffee.
Have a good trip, sir.
Thank you.
I don' t understand.
But on the streets I' m a disaster.
- I didn' t make it.
That' s impossible.
I know champagne is better with time...... but now it' s almost past the due date.
What happened?
Nothing, I just crashed into a butcher shop.
You should put a mouse in your car, instead of your steering wheel.
Like the disabled.
Come on...
Emilien, someone just set a new record.
A taxi, near the harbour.
You know how fast?
- 140?
Then he switched into 2nd... 217 Km/ h!
- Yeah of course, they called in the air force.
Imagine at that speed.
Listen, it' s funny.
What' s the difference between a comb and a moron?
- Ok you' re not listening.
I' il come back later.
- Yes.
Much later, and if it' s at night, that' s even better.
Next time, knock before you enter!
Petra...
I don' t mean that for you.
Thanks, Emilien.
So how did it go with your test, was it bad?
Ah, news travels fast.
I have news for you, the Chief is having a meeting now, and only you are missing.
Well, nobody told us you know!
You see there, it' s written "power".
You hear me?
I said in my office right now, are you deaf Emilien?
After hitting banks in Holland, Italy and Belgium... the Mercedes gang has arrived in France
And the Germans must absolutely not invade our territory again.
My grandfather died in their hands, so it' s a personnal matter.
So the Paris- Bonn liaison, German- French friendship, can kiss my ass.
You' re German... fine, but you' re a cop so it' s ok.
And they have the gall to announce the cities before hitting the banks!
It' s unbelievable!
Within 3 days, they will hit a bank in Marseille.
Red Alert, 24 hours a day!
We will have some support in the form of one trained driver per team.
As soon as the Germans leave the bank, our teams will follow them.... not losing them, acting like a venom....
That' s why this operation will be called... Cobra.
Petra, can you assemble the teams please?
3 per car.
One driver, one coordinator and one sniper.
Each team has a code name and a position written on the map behind you.
The team members are listed next to the map.
You have 50 minutes to get into position.
Excuse me Petra, it' s that dinner we talked about...... this week would be nice, because...... the computer software I developed, that we' ve talked about... it would be better not to wait too long, somebody could steal the idea.
- No.
Just who can' t wait, you or the software?
No, him... it, the software... the computer.
You see, it' s complicated That' s why I thought...... a dinner...
As soon as the Germans are arrested, I promise, I' il take care of you...... of the software I mean.
- Ah perfect.
- By the way, which team are you in?
I put you in the best team.
Hey, I think we' re out of coffee.
Have you seen my steering wheel?
It' s great, it' s personalized...... I bought it from Alain Prost.
With a new grip, special Dakar.
With even a ton of sand in the car...
Too bad we aren' t at the beach then.
Hey hey, don' t smoke, it irritates my eyes.
- No coffee, no smoking...
- No chicks!!
I repeat:
Boa calling Tiny Snake.
- Yeah, it' s Alan.
Is your team any good?
We' re all exchanging addresses.
- And you?
Somebody is pissing on us but apart from that everything' s fine.
Rachid, check out the small black Peugot behind us.
We' re not going to steal a car during the day!
Oh yeah, why not?
Fuck Marco!
We don' t know this neighbourhood, we should stick to what we know.
Don' t worry, all the cops are at the airport!
- Man.
- This is crazy.
All the cops are at the airport I told you!
I saw it on TV, there' s Clinton and this girl.
Hey, cops!
Check it out, Marco is here, he' s gonna screw you!
- Let' s arrest him.
- No, let him take the car,...... let him finish his show, we need the space.
I need to take a leak.
No we can' t leave the car, it' s orders.
All at the airport like I said.
Smile guys, you' re on camera.
I tell you guys if they don' t show up in one minute with their Mercedes...... it' s going to be coffee, a smoke and a shit.
We' re going to do all that later man!
I repeat no venom until the exit.
- Lieutenant?
- Petra, you' re disturbing me, I was into it.
I know, but it' s the minister.
- Minister, you aren' t at the airport?
- We just finished.
Tell me Gibert … what about that Mercedes gang you told me about?
We' re going to act soon.
Good, wait a second...
They won' t have time to visit Marseille
Tonight they' il be in jail, and tomorrow I' il send the Nazis back home... special delivery.
I don' t want to see this end in a shootout between Germans and French.
- Of course it is, Mister.
They are criminals just like any others, they won' t be treated any differently.
Maybe you should start by not calling them Nazis.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- I can count on you?
- Yes, don' t worry, remember the chinks...
Um, I mean the Asians.
Everything went smoothly.
Almost no deaths, at least not on our side.
Hello?
He hung up!
You see, it' s easy.
- Where are the wires?
- Shit, Marco! hurry up!
Are you going to steal the car or do I have to give you the keys?
We are the Tiny Snakes and that means we stay "cool".
We' re going to take it "cool", and not get venomous.
To all snakes, don' t mess up, we want them alive.
At least for an hour.
I don' t really feel in the mood, I guess I' d better leave you guys.
I really have to take a leak.
Let' s go!!
- What' s going on?
- It doesn' t look good, Minister.
Don' t move, Minister.
We fell into a trap, send us backup.
I repeat, I identified the accomplice car.
- 4 well trained men.
- Backup are coming, Minister!
Shit, shit!
I think we are shooting at cops.
They' re giving up... aren' t they?
Hello, this is Tiny Snake, we' ve had a small problem with the door.
Good morning Sir.
Don' t worry, we' il have you free you in 5 minutes.
No problem, no problem.
Ok, they' re giving up.
Funny... he looks just like...
like the Minister.
- Oh, you didn' t eat anything.
- Mom, no.
- Don' t worry about your license.
- Remember your father, he never got one either.
- How is that possible?
- I remember him driving when I was young - Yes, it' s true.
He took the exam 20 times and in the end they just gave it to him!
- You' re welcome.
Here, David, the landlord' s son asked me if you could fix this.
Yeah, tell him my name isn' t Super Mario.
No, I know your name is Super Cop, the one who upholds the law... and protects citizens against evil.
Oh dear, you have a good profession, I' m proud you.
That' s why you tell everyone I work at IBM?
- No.
You' re quiet and so am I.
I get to fix all the neighborhood electronic toys.
- Mom, I' m kidding!
- can you call me a taxi?
- I just met the perfect one!
Friendly, pleasant, the cream of the crop.
You' il like him very much.
- Am I on the wrong floor?
- That depends, who you are looking for?
- I' m looking for Camille.
- That' s me.
I mean, that' s here.
- Oh you' re her son the one who works at Apple.
- No, IBM.
I don' t know anything about computers.
But I saw your picture the other day.
Ah Daniel, this is my son Emilien.
I put labels on them - Monday is veal, Tuesday...
Ok mom, I promise, I' il be ok.
I left the car alone, I' m worried.
- Ah kiss.
- Kiss, kiss mom!
- Voltaire boulevard.
- I remember the police station but not IBM.
- We are going to the police station.
I install computers there.
If you don' t mind, I' m going to leave you just near the station.
I don' t really like being around pigs.
- Say, that motor sounds great for a taxi.
- You know cars?
Just a fan.
It' s a V6, a bit modified.
A motor just wants to "sing".
Um, don' t sing too loud, the speed limit is 50.
- Yeah.
I thought it was for skateboards.
No, no, I think it' s for anything that drives.
There' s driving and driving, you see I' m at 100.
Good car...... good driver, I' m relaxed.
No risks.
I' m less dangerous at 100 then that shit at 20 km/ h.
You saw it?
I saw it, yeah!
- You' re not afraid of radars?
- We know where there are radars.
Pigs doesn' t like change.
Always eating at the same place.
You' il see, there' s one just here.
You see them, they' re so stupid.
Picture!
You know they can' t do anything about it, they just follow the system.
They signed up, nobody forced them.
Sometimes I guess they are forced to join
The image I had of them was wrong.
It' s worse than we hear of them?
No. it' s better.
There aren' t just idiots in the police force.
Right, there are also alcoholics, crooks, morons!
Seriously, between us...... you know any normal person who would want to join the pig farm?
- And taxi drivers?
You know anybody that would want to become a taxi driver?
Those complainers that take you only when feel like it.
And that scream at you when the tip isn' t good.
They are all friends with the police.
Y se casan con una portera para tener casa gratis.
- No...
- Ah that' s reassuring!
Ok, there are maybe a few drivers who are rude with the customers.
With the police it' s the same thing.
Some of them do their jobs, just like you... and like me.
Maybe, yeah maybe.
But the thing is, being a taxi driver isn' t my real job.
Ah you drive a taxi only for fun... what is your real job then?
Do you have a bag, I don' t feel good.
Don' t worry, as long as we drive fast, nothing will come out.
Shit!
I' m sorry sir, that' s the first time that' s happened with me.
Usually the client gets out and walks a bit... then...
- I' m going to confess something.
Me too, that' s not my real job...
- Last and first Name.
- Morales, Daniel.
Profession... should I write crazy taxi driver or just crazy driver?
Whatever you want.
- At what speed were you going back there?
- Barely 90.
- Yes, it seems worse because the motor really kicks.... but in reality, the car doesn' t really go that fast.
- Very good.
- Can you go look in the stands to see if I' m there?
Remember that taxi, we saw it 5 minutes ago on the street.
He' s slowing down!
Not 90... 190.
Ah, must be the sun.
That' s why I saw 90.
If I had known, I would have slowed down.
Anyway, 90 is illegal.
The limit is 50... for everybody! cars, skateboards, taxis... everybody!
Is he happy now? caught ht me, did his job, he' s happy now.
My license is my living, if tonight I' m not driving, tomorrow I' m dead.
You' re going to be nice and finish me quickly.
Hey slow down, so I can enjoy it a bit.
Usually I' m the one screamed at all day, now for once I get lucky.
- Ah it doesn' t matter.
- That you didn' t knock I mean.
- Yes?
Unless you want to have dinner with a scarecrow.
I doesn' t bother me... you' re perfect Petra.
I mean no... yes it matters
It' s very bad for you...... but for me.. for the software it doesn' t matter.
All day it' s like that.
If only I could catch those German bastards
You' il see, you' il feel better.
Yeah, I have to... unless you have an idea.
- I said an idea, not a an idiocy.
I' m talking about a real idea of public interest.
- You want to turn me in a dog shit cleaner?
Something of public interest, for me.
Understand?
It' s like I represent the public...... and you do something in my interest.
- Ah you want money!.
- You' re really stupid!
Tell me clearly what you want.
- What do you want?
The Mercedes gang, does that ring a bell?
No, the only gangs I know would be into scooters.
They' re a gang specialized in robbing banks.
Yesterday was the 7th.
- Ah that' s too bad.
Yes, mostly for us.
Listen, I' il make you a proposal.
You' re a good mechanic, you drive well and I need a driver.
I' il remove all your infractions.
- You want me to be a cop for 1 month?
- Choose: cop or pedestrian.
- Death or shame?
- You got it.
Here you have all 7 attacks in order.
Don' t know much about Mercedes I' m more Ferrari.
Right now the gang is "Mercedes" but as soon they get into Ferraris, I' il call you.
- A red Mercedes, how awful.
- I know it' s red, tell us something we don' t know.
We' ve looked everywhere but maybe...
- You' re talking about a detail...
They' re German.
Mercedes, therefore Germans.
You must be exhausted.
The tires are very inflated, typical of Germans.
Also they have 8 "so they had to do that in Germany 'cause you can' t find that in France.
The Tires are quite worn, they' il need to order some soon.
In this picture, the muffler is a little bent but not on this one.
They must have bent it during an attack and repaired it afterwards.
Kruger is the only one who repairs this type in Marseille.
And Kruger is German.
Luckily you' re not a Mercedes expert!
- Where are we going?
- We' re starting with Kruger to see if he remembers anything.
What are you waiting for?
You want me to sing a song?
In this neighbourhood, I wouldn' t turn the Christmas lights on.
- What are we doing now?
- We' re starting the phase that takes 80% of a policeman' s life...... observation.
Get familiar with the terrain, observation of entrances and exits.... and analyse the situation.
When it closes we' il go ask Mr. Kruger a few questions.
- Kruger?
He never closes, he' s an insomniac.
They didn' t have anything else.
Too bad we didn' t stop by my mother' s, she makes terrific sandwiches.
Ham and Cheese.
Half Bayonne, half Parisian.
- It' s excellent.
- She made you one?
A small slice of cheese in the middle with lettuce.... and pickles.
Fabulous.
- This is mine?
- Really good, congratulations.
- What does he do?
- They' re Koreans.
A real pain in the ass for me, they work 24 hours a day.
- He must sleep at some point, they' re human.
- No, they' ve got a "technique".
One taxi, one plate, one license...... and 2 drivers.
- You can tell the difference between 2 koreans - incredible.
I know a Korean, he' s in the food business.
No.
We wait for him to close the garage.
We' re going to wait a long time, the guy is an insomniac and never closes.
- How do you know that?
- From the bar owner just in front of us.
Why didn' t you tell me before?
I haven' t been in the police force long, I don' t have the reflexes.
It' s not a matter of being a cop, it' s just common sense, shit!
We' re here like 2 idiots waiting for an insomniac to go to sleep!
Does that sound logical to you?
If I' m the Mercedes driver and I know the mechanic is an insomniac...... I' il come during the night, it' s much more discrete.
You think the driver will just show up...... with his nice Mercedes?
I can' t believe it!
When a driver isn' t driving, he' s in the garage.
- What are they doing there?
- Probably the 8 "tires they ordered from Kruger.
It' s a miracle!
I can' t let such an opportunity get away.
if it goes bad, call the station and give them the Mercedes plate numbers.
- Where are you going?
- The Korean trick.
The Korean trick!
What an idiot!
And the new tires, where are they going to put them?
- Me?
Sleeping.
I don' t have a house, my country is very cold.
Please!
Don' t hurt me!
I just wanted to sleep.
I' m going to find you a house where you' il sleep... and even eat maybe with a little bit of luck.
- Hey you' re hurting me!
- I just do what I can.
- What' s your name?
- Daniel.
Daniel.
- We' re going to call each other by name, it' il be better.
- Yeah, better.
Now that we' re friends, what just happened...
It stays between us...
When you let go of my hand, can I go to bed?
I' m no insomniac or Korean.
Of course not.
I did it on purpose, so that you really want me.
You won' t regret waiting.
Promises, promises.
Let me see what you can do.
Ah, not too bad.
A little bit more.
Huh?
It' s 6 am and it' s not Sunday, it' s Monday.
You can' t do that, Lily.
I waited all night.
Did I play dominos?
- Can' t you call in sick?
Sick on Monday morning?
Nobody has ever tried that one.
It can happen to anybody to be sick Monday morning.
You went to eat at your parents and you ate too much...... and you puked all night.
A man that works all week and then isn' t around on Sunday.
Do you think it' s reasonable?
I' m really sorry, Lily.
I had a shitty day.
I promise that if you accept a dinner here tonight, I' il explain everything.
Ok, just a light meal.
I don' t want to be sick on Tuesday morning.
We could even eat in bed to save time.
You' d better be good, it' s your last chance.
I' m going to impress you.
We' re going to wait all day in front of the garage again?
Observation is finished, now comes questioning.
Are you interested in seeing some real questioning?
- No.
- Well, you' re going to come anyway.
It' s better if I wait in the taxi, in case things go bad... like last time.
I need a translator.
I don' t want him to confuse me with technicalities.
Kruger won' t waste time to kick you out, I' m telling you.
Good morning people.
which one of you is called Kruger, please?
It' s written on the label just like a waitress.
Mr. Kruger, I' ve got a few questions for you.
Don' t worry, it won' t be long.
- What for?
They left a long time ago.
- Really?
- Open your eyes, there' s nobody here.
Oh yeah, nobody.
- Can I ask you a little question?
Are your questioning sessions always like that, or was it just to please me?
Let' s go out to get some air.
- You know, you saved my life back there.
- Yes.
It was worth a lot.
So let' s get rid of that one month of labour.
And turn it into only 1 week.
- You know how to deal.
- I need to catch that gang, it' s important for me.
- No.
In part yes, but mostly for me.
I' m tired of finishing off nights in the garbage can.
It' s a question of honour, maybe it' s crazy, but I need this.
- Can I have the night for myself?
- You' ve got to be kidding.
- Can I borrow him?
- Mom, it' s because...
I lost my prescription and the doctor agreed to write another one.
They' re closing in 5 minutes.
It' s my heart medicine.
I won' t let you die here, and that way I' il have saved the whole family today.
- You' re so charming, Daniel.
- I know, I know.
- Don' t worry, baby.
I' ve put a transmitter in that bullet, that way they won' t get away.
- You' re so clever Johnny - It' s my job, baby.
- Now we just have to follow them.
- Incredible! -... let' s save your father.
Guys, we just received a call.
They give us a rendezvous.
It' s gonna be the Bank of Marseille.
Since they are clear with us, I' m going to be the same with you.
I won' t tolerate any misbehaviour, any accidents, nothing!
Perfect coordination.
There are 2 words for this mission...
Serenity...... and efficiency.
the mission......
Listen up Tiny Snakes and Cobras!
I just got the idea of the century.
The Mercedes gang will be nailed tonight, or my name isn' t Emilien Barbadec.
I hope your plan is foolproof 'cause this is your last chance.
You' ve got the gun, so be nice and don' t miss.
Everybody on the floor!
Quickly!
Hands on the head!
- It' s working.
- Good, very good.
Follow them at a distance.
So you won' t be scared.
Gauguin Street.
I' m telling you, we' ve got them.
This is Gilbert.
All units: close off Gauguin street at 10 Km. around.
They didn' t move.
Just one street.
What' s happening?
- The dot disappeared.
- I know it disappeared.
- Find out why it vanished.
- They must be this way,...... a red Mercedes doesn' t go by unnoticed.
They' re close, I can feel it.
They' re supposed to be here.
Don' t shoot, I' m the hostage.
How...?
I don' t understand, I' m missing something.
A red Mercedes vanished.
Even Houdini never did that.
Hello, your papers please.
What' s going on, officer?
- You' re German?
- Yes Why?
Already at the border?
Chief, 4 Germans in a Mercedes, not red.
Interested?
- So you' re German.
- Yes, is that a problem?
No, it' s good actually.
Open the trunk.
- What are they doing in Marseille?
- They came to spend Deutchmarks...
-... but they can do that in another country if you prefer...
- No,...... I prefer that you keep that in our territory.
Ok, goodbye.
Have a nice stay.
Emilien.
I don' t understand, it' s impossible.
- You see, he forgot about the kettle.
- You think so?
He' s not like that.
It' s 8pm.
I' ve turned on the answering machine, and the alarm is set for 6am.
It should be enough, no?
- I think it' s going to be close...... but we can hurry just a bit at the end.
Expecting somebody?
Yes my lover, but when I found out you' d come, I cancelled.
- Who could it be?
- Leave it, they' il probably go.
- Where were we?
- I was kissing you.
No, you were kissing me.
- How?
I don' t know... the cops...
Yeah, maybe you' re a notorious criminal and they' ve come to get you.
You would take me hostage.
And if you just took me now?
- Open, Police!
- You didn' t kill anybody?
You' re here!
- You just can' t imagine what shit I' m in.
No, no you can' t imagine.
It' s gone, we don' t have an apartment anymore.
The apartment that my father gave us.
- Gone up in smoke, just like my father.
- My husband smoked a lot,...... but he died of liver cancer, we never knew why, he didn' t drink.
The apartment is nothing, the worst is that I messed up again.
If I don' t catch them by the end of the week, I' il be on traffic patrol by Monday.
Stick, whistle, move along kids!
What I' m saying is, Monday I' m dead.
- Daniel, who' s that dwarf?
- A friend.
Playing with smurfs now?
- It' s a bit complicated, he' s a cop...
- You' ve got a friend in the police?
-... I work for him, because...
- You work for the cops?
No, not for the cops, for him!
He' s not really a cop....... he looks more like a secret agent, or something like that.
Right, and the old lady is Mata Hari.
Can someone explain this to her?
Hello.
The smurf over there is my son, Emilien.
I want you to show me the kitchen, I' m going to make us some coffee. - and then I' il explain everything.
It' s over, but it started so well... but then came the garbage bin, the butcher, the Mercedes...
What are you going to do with them then?
Should I call the cops, the real ones?
Ok, agreed?
I' m not complicating the situation.
I just want to finish what we started.
And I don' t want to waste an hour because the schedule is very tight.
I' m caught in a tight spot and when I say caught I mean seriously.
I could lose my license for 100 years.
I help him and he gives me back my licence, 100 years of unemployment you see?
Police, blackmailer, and smurf.
Nice picture, you could have finished him before putting him in traffic.
Here you go, it was completely stupid of me.
I' m not kidding, you' re free.
Daniel, you know I didn' t come here because of our deal.
I haven' t got any other friends.
Mom told me you had a big heart.
Really, he' il help?. "
Ok, I think we made a mistake.
It doesn' t matter.
It' s not important, it' s not your problem.
Don' t worry, I' il catch that gang alone.
But I' m gonna do it.
Listen, the best way to get rid of him is to solve his problem.
But he doesn' t have one problem, he' s got a thousand.
Look at his face, he reminds me of "silence of the lambs".
- In 2 hours I' m back.
- And what do I do with the lady for 2 hours?
- Please, Lily.
- If in 2 hours you' re not here, I burn the lady.
- It' s a deal.
- Come on.
- Where are we going?
- To solve your problem.
I' m sorry to have ruined your evening.
- Your coffee is really good?
- The best in town.
A nice coffee to change the mood and for forgiveness.
- Ok?
Yes.
I thought about it all night and there was one question I couldn' t answer.
Why a red Mercedes when grey is much more discrete?
look here, then...... it appears over there!
It' s a diversion!
Or maybe the money is still in the bank.
1 minute, end of show.
I' il be back later.
- 10 grand.
- To help pay the rent for the next few years.
- And my wife?
- You really want her?
- Well, I' m used to her now.
Calm down dear.
Now, everything' s going to be fine.
"One more bank, and we retire."
And for the last one, I suggest we finish greatly.
Emilien!
- You' re a pain.
I' il tell you how they changed from a red to a grey Mercedes.
- Go ahead.
- They didn' t change the car, they changed the colour.
A nice red Mercedes enters the parking lot...... and a classic grey Mercedes exists and then disappears.
- Is it possible?
- Child' s play.
If they did repaint the car we would have found paint traces somewhere.
Unless they used a truck to get the car in.
They' d need to buy tons of paint if they do that each time.
They did it in record time, they had less than 10 minutes.
Is there paint which dries in 10 minutes?
Sorry to wake you, it' s Daniel.
I need your magic paint, the MD10.
Color metal grey.
You ran out?
At the race track?
What are they doing with that much paint?
Are they painting the track red?
No, don' t worry about it.
I' il try dealing with them myself.
Talk to you soon, thanks man.
- What does that mean, MD10?
- Less than 10 minutes.
You like my theory?
- You think it' s them?
- No, it' s some old ladies training every Tuesday.
What' s the plan?
- We' re going to say hello.
- They' re going to see us.
- Yep, we' il make it so they won' t forget us.
They' re going to remember me, they saw me in the trunk!
- Oh shit.
Is it alright like that?
It' s perfect.
Hey faggots, everything ok?
Think you' re Schumacher?
You spin around the track.
What are those little cars you' ve got?
Mercedes?
They build cars too?
Do Germans know how to play the tortoise and the hare?
Give me 55.
- Maybe I should get out now, eh?
- No, you' il see, they' re playful.
The turtle and the hare goes like this...... 55 to the one that passes my car over 2 laps.
- You know how to count?
- We don' t want the money.
I said 55 because I had a good conscience not to take more.
But a tourist that doesn' t get robbed is not really a tourist, right?
Look in your rear- view mirror in case I' ve already lapped you after the 1st lap.
So it wouldn' t be worth an doing an extra lap.
Thanks girls!
Get lost!
It' s not that I' m bored but I gotta go to the garage.
It just doesn' t run fast anymore.
Whenever you want, we' il have a rematch.
- Here' s your 55.
- What are we doing now?
- Let' s get a drink.
French...
You' re completely crazy, we had the whole gang.
- We could have called for backup and got them!
- Yeah, on what?
- Speeding... on a race track?
We would have found the evidence later, we do it all the time.
Yes or no?
But for the moment we' re only collecting offences.
If we continue, it' s us who will end up in jail.
You' il have your flag.
Now they' re all warmed up and nobody' s more playful than a pilot.
Now we can set a trap for them.
What kind of trap?
- And what is your "idiot trap"?
- Ok.
It goes like this: we make them go where we want.
And this is: here.
We' il need 20 traffic light keys and 20 super Walkie- Talkies.
Walkie- Talkies are ok but for the keys, the guys always carry them.
- Oh yes.
- Oh yes.
You' ve got talent!
Here you go, Jimmy.
- It' s going to take time, I' m freezing.
- One minute.
What are you doing naked?
I' m not naked.
I' ve got a towel wrapped around me.
What do you care?
I have the right to be naked in my office, no?
- Yes.
Nobody taught you to knock before entering?
You' ve never learned anything idiot!
Oh, what a welcome!
I wanted to tell you a good joke.
Your jokes are never funny, get out!
Ah! it feels so good!
COME IN!
Petra...!
- Am I disturbing you?
- Never!
Yes, I can see I' m disturbing you.
Can you believe that Daniel?
Anyway look at that...
And she' s already Sergeant.
- What could she want with a guy like me?
Enough.
You' re done whining?
You already started digging your grave.
She' s not lady charity.
An engine like her doesn' t work with low grade oil.
What she needs is a MAN.
You look more like an monkey now.
Stand up straight!
Now you go see her and you kiss her and that' s it.
There' s a 50/ 50 chance.
If it doesn' t work at least you' il know.
It' s like a game show, either you get it or you don' t.
Are you alright?
You' re right.
We shouldn' t worry like that.
I' il go for it.
- He' il have other chances.
- Where are we with the keys?
- Done!
You think they' re going to be mad?
If a girl shows up 17 hours late, what would you do?
- I kill her.
- So you got your answer!
But we' ve got flowers here.
- Oh the nice flowers!
- Can we smoke them?
- Yes.
What a crisis!
Thanks, Camille.
I had a wonderful day.
Are the flowers for me?
Thanks, goodbye.
You don' t want to have a intimate evening?
You' ve got visitors, Daniel.
We' il do it an other day, we' re not short of time.
Camille will sleep in your bed, her back hurts.
- Man this is good stuff.
- Sure, it' s Jamaican.
- You see, it' s not so bad in the forces.
- Stop it, you' re tempting me.
Tell me, why didn' t you race directly instead of doing it with a taxi?
My father spent his life in a wheelchair because of a car accident.
How could I explain him that I wanted to be a race car driver?
- And you?
How did you end up where you are?
My dad died when I was 17, my mother and I were alone.
So I had to go to work right away.
And without a degree, only the cops wants you.
- Where did you live?
- In Asnières.
- In Jules Ferry?
Why?
- You too?
- Yes, I swear.
It' s crazy, we could have ended up in the same class.
I would have taught you to steal bikes and you wouldn' t have turned out so bad!
Life' s like that, you dream about so many things when you' re a kid and in the end...... nothing goes as planned.
You dream of playing forward and you end up a goalie.
Do you think our plan will work, Daniel?
It will work.
Are you sure?
Come in.
Am I disturbing you?
No, I' m fine now.
Red Alert!
Guys, the cougar' s plan has started.
It' s the S. D. L. M. banks.
Here are you positions for today.
Arthur, at the crossroads Nº 1.
Momo at the crossroads de Le Beché.
Nº 2, radio and key.
Nº 4...
Yes?
- Yes, I know you' il come back in 1 hour.
- Exactly.
I' il wait for you at your place.
Cougar speaking The bird is in the cage.
On your knees!
Cougar speaking.
The bird will soon leave his cage.
Prepare yourselves.
Shit, they got hostages.
Don' t do anything yet.
- Sorry, no more room for you.
- Ok, no problem.
You' re going to run next to the car.
It won' t be bad for you.
I' m tired!
All cougar units get out!
Catch the bird!
Catch the bird!
You see it' s not the Mercedes we needed to follow... it' s the Mercedes truck we needed to follow.
This calls for a toast!
Cheers!
It' s a go.
- Everything ready?
If they cross any of these diagonals they' re caught like rats.
If they take Michelet boulevard, they' il end up at place Mazard.
Who' s on that corner?
- Jean- Bat, Nº 7.
- Call him, he' il be the opening act.
Nº 7, Jean- Bat.
- Yes, I' m here.
- You' il be the first, are you in position?
- So it' s our turn now.
- Yes, yes.
Hey Bavarians, how are you?
Sorry about last time.
I forgot I had the handbrake on, that' s why I didn' t go very fast.
Hey, I' m talking to you.
Now it' s a lot better.
- Do we race again or are you staying the losers?
You french always have such big mouths.
- Come onto the highway with me, we' il see!
- Did I upset you?
- I' m going blow up your Peugeot!
- Sorry, I did upset you.
I feel cheap taking money from you so easily.
Here you go darling, 10 francs.
- You' re going to pay for your insolence.
- Better to be insolent than ridiculous!
- I think you overdid it a bit.
Tell 7, 8 and 9 to go to red.
Jean- Bat, go to red now.
- Nº 11, in position.
Perfect.
12 and 13, prepare yourselves.
This is number 13.
I' ve got a small problem here.
- There are 2 cops at the traffic light.
- Easy to say!
They' re not going anywhere.
We' re getting close, find a solution!
Otherwise, we' re finished.
Pollo, let me talk to the cops.
Sorry sir, it' s for you.
- Hello.
- This is Sergeant Gibert, we' ve found a bomb and it' s just next to you.
- Where?
- In the traffic light.
Stay calm, we know how to stop the mechanism.
Listen carefully: put the key in the light and make the light turn red.
- It' s already red!
- Don' t worry about the colour!... just turn the key to the right!
Yes, yes, Sergeant.
- We just passed 12.
- Hurry up, hurry up!
Can I do it?
- 19 and 20, get ready.
- I know.
- Are you sure there' s a road there?
- It' s a shortcut.
On the highway, they' re dead.
We' ve got more power.
- If there was a fence, maybe there was a reason.
- Yep, the highway isn' t finished, it' s a dead end.
The important thing is that you know it.
- I look calm like but in fact I' m not.
- It won' t be long.
- That' s what worries me, I want to live long!
Take that frog!
- We' ve got to stop, there' s no bridge!
Take him!
Take him!
You only bet 10 francs!
- It' s now or never!
Hold on!!!
We won!
Are you sure?
I swear, you scared me to death!
I really thought you would rather die than lose.
Between the tortoise and the hare it' s always the tortoise that wins!
You know "La Fontaine"?
Big hare not happy to been fucked by little Tortoise.
Cougar will be happy.
For a long time he' s wanted to eat hare.
Yes, big hare, big hare.
I' m sorry about the place.
It' s not very romantic.
- Oh really?
I didn' t feel it.
No, later.
We' ve really got to go now.
Daniel, What are you doing?
I' ve been looking for you for 15 minutes.
- Photo finishing.
It' s not the time for photo finishing.
The sergeant is waiting!
In the name of the president of the Republic...... it is an honour to offer you the medal of the knight.
Congratulations.
- I owe you an apology.
- For not believing in me, or for slapping me?
How can you forgive me?
We' il find a way.
Amazing!
Thank you.
We are going to change the way we see the road.
We are going to implement a police force more efficient and modern.
- And all that thanks to you.
- Thank you.
This medal is only a symbol.
It won' t give you your license back.
- I was hoping for more...
- Exactly.
We' ve got mercy.
We' ve got enough to put you in jail for many years... but you are free.
- I' m not free, I can' t drive.
- I understand.
Without a car, you are like an orphan.
- I understand.
I got a solution but I' m not sure it will suit you.
Tell me, and we' il see.
- So?
Are you happy?
- You' re not happy?
- Yes it' s great.
I don' t understand.
Your first Grand Prix, pole position, a great car, friends...
-... your girlfriend.
What' s wrong?
- The sponsor!
We find him money, a car and he' s still not happy.
Tell the cheerleader to stop moving, it distracts me.
- You know what you could do that would make me happy?
Because we don' t give a damn about the sponsors on the car.
Ok then, take the champagne out of the freezer.
It' s not good too cold.
Let' s go, Daniel!
Harald!
- What' s up, Harald?
How are you?
- Fine.
- Need alift?
- No, I' m getting picked up.
Why are there always so many of you in your cars?
It' s environmentally responsible.
I want my money, Harald.
May I get out first?
I want that money, okay?
I need aweek.
lf you want aweek, you go up to3 1/ 2, okay?
You wantyour interest, right?
On Monday, Harald.
Remember.
Do you want a trade?
Vuk?
Do you want anything?
Mineralwater.
- You don' t want raisins?
- Can' tyou make your own pastry?
Sure, but shouldn' t there be raisins in it?
- Vuk, try Martin' s pastries yet?
- I tried five.
Really good.
He' s going to compete in the Danish Pastry Championships.
You' il definitely win with that pastry, Martin.
There are alot of other good pastries.
Harald?
What the hell are you doing?
- Pastry.
- Why didn' tyou come and get me?
Think it' s fun riding the bus?
They stop every 5 feet to drop off junkies.
- Why didn' tyou come?
- We didn' t know you were out.
- Or what' s it called... released.
- We thought it wasn' t until tomorrow.
- What' s that?
- It' s Vuk.
Harald, this is Vuk.
Vuk, this is Harald.
- He' s been hired here.
- Who hired him?
We did, more or less.
He' s a great electrician.
He put in awhole new lighting system.
- Vuk was an electrician in Sarajevo.
- He won' t be in my kitchen.
There' s plenty of light.
Get lost, Sambo.
Didn' tyou hear what I said?
Go back to San Diego.
- Vuk is Ratko' s cousin.
- I don' t care about Ratko.
Who gave you permission to change everything?
- The slacking off is over.
- We' ve talked alot about that.
- What didyou talk about?
- Well, ahh...
We... We don' t want to do this any more.
Of course you can do whatever you want to.
We just don' t want to be criminals.
Lose the ladder.
And the flowers.
They look like shit.
Lose the ladder, Peter.
You drive for weddings now?
We' ve taken the day off.
Here!
Nuts and pistachios.
Hey, Harald... Why can' t Vuk work in your kitchen?
He needs ajob, man.
His mother won' t accept an unemployed son.
Vuk' s mother will have to get used to it.
- Do you have my 3 1/ 2 million?
- No.
Hire Vuk with full benefits andyou get another week.
I need more than aweek.
lf you treat him right, you get another three days.
Send him over on Monday.
Make sure you get the money.
Take out amortgage.
You' ve got ice cream all over, man.
- We can' t work in this light.
- Puk is coming on Monday.
We need the lights fixed, right?
- What the hell is that?
- Jellyfish Sushi.
- Why are you making confectionery?
- They' re salmon Maki rolls.
- It' s raw fish.
- No way I' m touching that shit.
This isn' t some fast food joint.
Cook that damn fish.
Yes?
Yes.
No, of course.
I' il be there right away.
The Monk is in the hospital.
You could have guessed.
He hasn' t exactly lived ahealthy life.
Do you want to come visit him?
It may be the last time.
We don' t want to do this any more.
What don' tyou want to do?
The man is fatally ill.
Come on, let' s go.
Mr. Monk, I' m preparing some medication for you.
- Visiting hours are over!
- Harald...
- Are you relatives?
- You could say that Harald is.
- Yes, we' re family.
- He' s boasting.
Wait with that.
I want to be able to talk.
- Two minutes.
- Thank you very much.
- What the hell, Monk?
- Harald, my child.
My liver is giving up.
There' s nothing to do.
I had always counted on getting shot.
That' s not how it' s going to be.
Thanks.
I don' t really feel like it anyway.
- ls there anythingyou need?
- No.
Yeah...
There may be one thing.
It' s alittle complicated.
- I would like to see my son.
- You don' t have a son.
Oh yes I do.
I have a son.
- You never mentioned it.
- There was no reason to.
His mother was a stewardess, Swedish.
Crazy bitch.
I never got in touch.
I was in jail, so...
I couldn' t do anything.
He needs to see his Dadwhile I' m still around.
That' s obvious.
We' iljust find him.
- Where does he live?
- ln Sweden.
- Where does he live exactly?
- ln Sweden, you idiot.
- Where in Sweden?
- He' s in jail.
- What did he do?
- Nothing serious.
- He' s probably changed.
- What' s he called?
Ludvig.
- lf he' s in jail, we can' t...
- Of course you can.
Visiting hours are over.
Leave immediately!
- We' il find him.
- Thank you, my boy.
It' s not anormal prison.
It' s for prisoners with life sentences.
They can' t just give us a cookie.
I' m about to die of hunger.
It' s impregnable. We' ve got to tell Harald that we can' t get him out.
Stop kicking, you loser.
Brat.
I' m sorry, butyou can' t be here.
- ls that lobster?
- Wouldyou go back to your seat?
How hadyou imagined we were going to get him out?
- Drive abulldozer through the wall.
- But there are three walls.
- Real silverware and cloth napkins.
- What the hell are you doing?
Don' t eat my crab.
Go back to your seat.
What did he do?
He' s in Sweden' s most heavily guarded prison.
It must have been parking tickets.
Wouldyou go back to your seat?
I' m sorry, butyou can' t be here.
Stop it and go back to your seat.
It might be that it' s not completely impossible.
lf you kick me one more time...
Here comes another cake.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Peter called and had some rooms set aside.
- Do you speak English?
- Martin, doesn' t she speak Danish?
We have made areservation for two rooms for Mr. Blixen.
Ask if they have a conference room.
- A conference room?
- Yes.
- One with ablackboard.
- Why?
Ask. lf he' s had an idea, he' il tell us.
- Then I' il ask.
- Bitch.
Come on.
- Come on, Martin.
- The keys...
Come on.
- "Meet room"...
- That' s what it' s called.
It' s not called a "meet room".
That' s damn bad service.
- Peter is right.
She was abitch.
- He just had amullet.
We' il meet in the conference room in two minutes!
Tight security at the prison means the prisoners walk freely in the yard.
We' re going to use that.
Let' s say you' re the pear.
You come in here...
Let' s back up alittle bit.
Harald, this is you.
You walk into the yard and meet Ludvig.
Meanwhile Martin and I are on the bridge, which is300 meters away.
lf we pretend this is the bridge, then that' s Martin and this is me.
We' re standing looking into the prison yard.
We shoot awire300 meters down.
You click onto the wire.
You put on arappelling seat.
Firstyou connect to the wire, and then to this basketball post.
Then Martin drives the truck down to the end of the bridge.
The truck is carrying a 1, 000- liter water deadweight.
So the wire is completely taut.
At the center of the wire is 7 1/ 2 meters of bungy cord.
Release the wire, andyou' il fly over the wall and land under the bridge.
- And Martin and I will pick you up.
- You don' t really mean this, do you?
It' s completely safe.
People pay 500 kroner to do it by the harbor.
Get whatyou need and put the bottles back in the mini- bar.
Here.
Martin, put it on.
- Can you see him?
- There are alot of dogs.
They' re crazy about dogs over here.
Hold this a second.
It' s the bungy.
- ls he there?
- No.
There he is.
The guy by the bench?
Thank you very much.
Hi.
I' ve come to getyou out.
Leave me alone.
- I think he' s got him.
- Then you get this.
Your father would like to see you.
I don' t have a father.
Fire!
Guard!
- What' s happening, Martin?
- What' s happening?
It' s those dogs.
Pull!
Pull!
How was I to know the dogs would hold on?
- Let' s get him up.
- Do we have to?
It' s not my fault the dogs held on so tightly.
- We go left next time.
- Are you sure?
It' s anon- stop train.
It arrives in 11 minutes.
How much does a Doberman actually weigh?
Ludvig!
Hurry up.
Come down here!
ln case someone sees you.
Get lost!
- What did he say?
- He doesn' t want to come down.
You' ve got to come home to Denmark.
We' re taking the bridge.
You haven' t driven on ityet, have you?
Come down.
Show it to him.
It' s apicture of your father, the Monk.
- You' re father' s really sick.
- Come on.
Let me handle this.
That will give you abladder infection.
You have to visityour father.
They' ve lied to you all these years.
Come on.
We' ve brought a change of clothes for you.
ls it true?
ls it my father?
Yes, it' s your father.
Here!
Take this.
Shit, man.
Ludvig, stop it!
That' s not necessary.
I won' t run away.
Well, you definitely won' t now.
Harald, there' s somethingwrong with him.
Can' tyou tell?
- Look at his eyes, he' s crazy.
- He' s a great guy.
35sveteas for apiece of pastry.
Where are we now?
{y: i} A few hours ago, Ludvig Petterson, {y: i} serving alife sentence, escaped.
{y: i} He has been convicted of {y: i} the murders of five women.
{y: i} He is extremely dangerous.
{y: i} lf you see this man - {y: i} - inform the police immediately.
What did they say?
He killed five women.
Damn, Harald.
They were probably really irritating.
Sister, how long can it take?
- Harald...
- I don' t want to talk about it.
Let us eat in peace.
Ludvig?
What are you doing?
She was talking on the phone and there was this gust of wind.
And then she fell.
Get into the car!
Sorry.
You' ve got so much hair and I' ve got so little.
It feels so strange.
I' ve so wished...
Well, that I had a father.
We kids always thought -
- that we had a father who was apilot or amillionaire.
I was apilot once.
And millions rolled in once.
So theoretically, I could have been a great father.
Damn!
I didn' t know that.
lf I had known that, you wouldn' t have gotten...
I wasn' t what I should have been, but then I took care of Harald.
Can we go now?
Let them get to know each other.
- Nice shirt.
- ls there somethingwrongwith it?
- It' s nice.
- I like it alot.
It' s warm too, right?
It' s just orange.
What' s the matter with you?
ls it serious?
- I' m dying, Ludvig.
- No.
Yes.
Out of the question.
We just met.
Yes...
But that' s how it is.
I think Mr. Monk needs to rest.
You' ve been here long enough.
Ludvig, let go of her.
Then give me five minutes.
You' re not the only one that knows the Monk.
Don' tyou understand this is ahospital?
Get out!
He looks like his mother.
I don' t understand it. Why don' t they just give him anew liver?
- Because there are waiting lists.
- We' ve got to do something.
I' il take care of that.
Don' t go wrecking everything.
I' il help the Monk.
Do you understand?
We' il call Erling.
My doctor.
He' il help us.
- Ecuador.
- Ecuador?
Yes, Ecuador, German surgeons have specialized in liver transplants.
They get ahold of fresh organs.
You' re as good as new afterwards.
I' ve got the contact.
- Where is Ecuador?
- ln South America.
Right behind Brazil.
They' ve got amazingwildlife.
And really nice lndians.
Completely naked.
And really nice lndians.
Completely naked.
- Can' tyou get that light fixed?
- ls it expensive?
- The lndian girls.
- One of those livers.
A liver costs $300, 000.
Maybe I can get it down to 280, 000.
- That' s alot of money.
- We can' t do it, Harald.
We' ve got to do something.
- Harald, we can' t do it.
- Harald, it' s impossible.
- Harald.
- Fuck, man.
Really nice pastry.
Can I have the recipe?
Of course not.
It' s a secret.
- You can take some with you.
- It wouldwork wonders.
You can' t take the whole pastry.
No, that' s fine.
It' s been in your bag.
Have you ever robbed abank?
It' s been a few years.
It has for me too.
You don' t forget.
It' s just like riding abike, right?
You want to transfer your money to Dan Hansen' s account?
- All of it?
- Just do it, okay?
Can you write anote?
Something like "For rent".
Okay, then write:
Goodbye, Dan.
"Don' t bring that little bastard to my funeral, you damn bastard".
No, not "you damn bastard".
Erase that.
Write "you deceiving shit".
Do you want to talk to someone about this?
Down!
Get up!
The money.
All the money.
- Down, I said.
- Then shoot!
My clothes will get wrinkled.
- I have to go to a funeral.
- Okay, you stay standing!
Didyou say funeral?
Who died?
ls it a girl?
Shut up, you two!
Was itvery gentle?
How did she die?
- No, it was suicide.
- What kind of abank is this?
Don' tyou have any money?
There' s no money here.
100, 000.
- Who pressed it?
- It happens automatically.
Why are they coming so quickly?
Everyone gets up and comes out the door with us!
Get up, damn it!
Scubaba, scubaba.
- What the hell didyou say?
- Get up!
ls it a good idea?
Quickly!
Out!
Close together!
Hey, my name is...
My name is Bente Halsted and I' m anegotiator.
I' m your friend.
- Drive, damn it!
I said drive!
- I don' t want to.
- Drive!
- Ouch!
- Don' tyou hit me, you beast!
- Are you nuts?
We' ve got ahostage!
Drive now!
Drive!
- Drive, bitch!
- Then speak properly!
lf Lyngby also wins, you' il get9 to 1.
They' re giving money away.
- What' s all that money doing?
- It' s breeding.
Breeding?
- It' s being bet on football.
- On football?
I' ve got a friend at FCK.
They play FC Mid- Jutland on Sunday -
- but have got nothing to play for.
They' re not starting the first squad.
lf you match FC Mid- Jutlandwith four other winners, you get9 to 1 odds.
- What kind of friend is he?
- Dan Hansen.
They' re sure to lose.
He' s holding aparty on Saturday.
lf we bet8, 000 -
- we can get 71, 000 on Monday morning.
We might as well bet all of it on Mid- Jutland.
All of it.
No, try to listen. We bet it all on the team that wins.
And on Monday we' il get 1 million.
- 1 million.
That' s alot of money.
- Shut up and fix that light.
- It' s not a completely sure thing.
- lf Peter says so, it is.
Then we' re going to watch football.
What is it?
Nothing.
{y: i} Morten Bisgaard {y: i} with a good chance...
Oh.
- Here.
- Thanks.
- What' s the score?
- 0- 0.
- These are team scarves. Wear them.
- No thanks.
Martin.
- We' re supporting Mid- Jutland.
They didn' t have any Mid- Jutland scarves.
- There!
Was it the right team?
- There!
- It' s a done deal!
It' s damn good, Peter.
No, no, no, what' s going on?
He fell by himself.
He didn' t touch him.
There' s nothing there.
- He didn' t touch him.
- ls it apenalty kick?
- It probably is.
- That' s the guy you know, right?
Know and know...
We went to school together.
{y: i} Here comes {y: i} Dan Hansen with the ball.
{y: i} lt' s tied at 1- 1.
{y: i} There are only a few seconds left.
{y: i} FCK ties it up at 1- 1.
{y: i} 1- 1is the final result.
{y: i} Surprising to many, {y: i} but definitely not undeserved.
- Are they playing at the Park?
- Yes.
Harald, what are we doing here?
Shouldn' t we?
Shouldn' t we find aplace to eat?
Get some food somewhere.
Somewhere nice.
ls that him?
- ls that him?
- What the hell are you doing?
Come on, let' s go.
- It wasn' t his fault.
- He cheated us.
Hello!
- Peter?
- Hi, Dan.
You owe me amillion.
You shouldn' t lie to us.
I won' t do anything to him.
I just want my million.
Harald...
It' s the bookie' s fault.
Don' t touch him.
There' s still electric current in him.
Vuk will have to clean this up.
You two owe me amillion.
Vuk, don' t touch him.
Step away from him.
- He had been sold to Dortmund.
- He just needs some fresh air.
- Do you want some?
- No thanks, I just ate.
We' il fly to Bremen in a small plane.
And then on to Ecuador.
You need to bring all of the money in cash.
- Not Euros, they don' t want them.
- What is $280, 000 in Danish?
I talked them down to $260, 000.
But count on 2 1/ 2 million kroner.
That' s alot of money.
Do you have it?
- You just order that liver.
- Then I' il call.
- My name is Ludvig.
- Wouldyou like apiece of pastry?
Even if you had that much money, you shouldn' t spend it on me.
Buy some Polish whores and live it up.
Harald says you have ahard time with the ladies.
Has Harald become apsychologist?
That would be the last thing he' d do.
Don' t waste your life.
It' s hard to be alone.
Can' tyou find ababe?
But when I have to...
Harald told me.
At some point you feel like killing the bitch.
There' s always someone who can put up with you.
You can' t end up as an old man alone in apolished car.
I don' t have a car.
You' il get my Mercedes.
You just need awoman first.
- I mean it.
- Sleep.
You need it.
Sleep.
{y: i} Red, red roses {y: i} Roundin ladies' clothes {y: i} The scentis carried {y: i} by the evening breeze {y: i} When we listen cheek to cheek
Get a grip.
Sleep tight.
I' il come again tomorrow.
Sleep tight, Dad.
You' re kidding.
I am so tired of havingyou running around here.
Don' tyou know what time it is?
This is ahospital...
- Hi.
- What are you doing?
Have you taken her clothes off?
- She fell.
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
We' il put her in the freezer.
Peter and Martin will take care of it.
How is the Monk?
Pretty bad.
He wants to give me his car.
He' s got lots of them.
He gave me one too.
I was offered his Mercedes.
No, he doesn' t want to get rid of that.
He said I could have it.
You' re going to have to stop that.
The girls... it' s not nice.
She fell.
You?
What are you doing?
I just wanted to say thanks.
Andyou...
You know what?
Don' tyou ever hit me again!
Shut up.
How stupid.
What did she mean, she wanted to thank me?
I have no idea.
- Martin, we want pastry too.
- I' il letyou know when it' s done.
Congratulations.
A watch!
You have to blow out the candles.
Then you have to make awish or else.
- We want pastry too.
- I' il letyou know.
Hey, Vuk.
Come here. What are you doing?
Don' tyou speak Danish?
Come down here.
Come here.
- This is for you.
- Me?
- Yes, it' s apresent.
- You bought him apresent?
I don' t treat him badly.
I saved his life too, right?
Hello.
It was really expensive.
You press here.
Then the scrub cloths get cleaned each time.
So don' t buy too many new scrub cloths.
That' s a great cake, Martin.
Hurry up and eat it.
I' il get Ludvig.
Dan?
- What the hell are you doing?
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
What' s going on?
There' s plenty of life in her yet.
She' il be abit groggy to start with.
Her brain has been cooled down.
She' il probably have a cold.
Give her chamomile teawith honey.
- She ought to be dead by now.
- Her circulation was stopped.
You can' t bleed if you' re frozen stiff, right?
- Well, if you...
- Got any more pastry?
- Leave some for the others.
- I' ve started to experiment.
How much butter do you use per pound of flour?
We can' t tellyou.
I can' t do anything about the other two.
- Say hi to Harald.
- What' s that about pastry?
Damn, my head hurts.
What the hellwere you doing in that freezer?
- Where do you know Harald from?
- Who?
- You must know.
- ls he the one from the bank?
- ls he the one that killed Dan?
- Where do you know Dan from?
He' s my boyfriend.
He keeps leaving me, the jerk.
You' ve got to go before Harald comes.
- What the hell are you two doing?
- Hi.
- Who called Erling?
- Martin.
- Why is she alive?
- She hit me with aham.
- What are you doing, Martin?
- I don' t know.
It was a shame for her, that she...
She tried to kill Peter with a smoked ham.
- What?
- Ham.
We don' t kill people for fun.
- I' il have to start from the beginning.
- Who are you?
Move so you don' t get blood on you.
Stop it now, Fatso.
You shouldn' t butt in like that -
- and shout and scream like alittle kid!
Shit, I' ve had areally badweek.
I want to go home now.
Wouldyou drive me home?
She had ahard night, so I' m going to take care of her.
See you later.
- Do I shout and scream?
- No, no, not at all.
- Am I rude to you?
- Not at all.
She was...
Herbal teawith honey.
I' iljust wipe it up with...
Get ahold of Erling before he leaves.
It' s right here.
I simply don' t know how to thank you.
I only drove you home.
You saved my life at the bank.
I mean it.
I would have killed myself if you hadn' t come.
And then all that stuff with Dan...
I' ve never been able to get away from him.
ln the freezer, I could see what abig idiot he is.
There is areason why we met each other.
I would like a good cup of coffee.
Okay, come on.
There is never any warmwater.
Can you findwhatyou need?
There are Saltines by the sink.
No, over the coffeemaker.
You can' t find a good plumber.
What is it?
You want to fix my shower?
No, damn it...
Let' s try again.
Tomato, Harald?
- Didyou break Vuk' s jaw?
- Vuk fell over.
This is your last chance, Harald.
I want my money now!
- I' iljust go in with these.
- You' re staying here.
This is serious.
I want my money now.
I can' t get3 1/ 2 million now.
Do you have an idea how to get the money?
Then I' ve got an idea.
I' ve got ajob for you out at the airport.
Read it closely.
It' s your last chance.
Okay?
- Where the hell did he go?
- What?
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
The Danish Pastry Championships.
- The Danish Pastry Championships?
- Yes.
The opening round is being held at the Bella Center.
Martin' s got a great chance of winning.
- Our old cooking school is coming.
- You' il come inside and sit down.
Sorry I' m late.
I' ve been at Mille' s.
Her breasts aren' t hard and cold.
They' re like aballoon filled with blood. Warm and soft.
They curve round and...
She also said she wants to get married.
- What he' s saying is...
- I know what the man' s saying.
Have you forgotten your father is really sick?
Shouldwe continue?
It' s about a sealed money transport in aplane.
Come in here and sit down!
A money transport in aplane.
This is a Hercules.
Send them round.
The Monk, Peter, Martin and I are waiting in an ambulance.
He' s the only one that can fly.
- We can' t fly aplane.
- Shut up.
Erling gives the Monk some morphine.
Vuk checks in on another plane.
DK 603 to Gran Canaria.
The ambulance enters the apron.
Ludvig, you will be in the first class lounge.
Be creative.
Think of somethingyourself.
We get in before the real ambulance comes.
This is the cool part.
We drive right down to the Hercules.
We drive into the Hercules, take out the guards and fly away.
- What guards?
- Some rent- a- guards.
What the hell are you doing, Vuk?
He' s stillwired!
It' s just a shoe!
Can' tyou be more careful?
The Hercules flies so low that they won' t find us on radar.
You throw the money in the sea and jump after it.
Vuk' s uncles on a ship pick us up.
The Hercules crashes.
Have you ever had your noses licked?
The containers will sink. We can' t jump out of aplane, can we Peter?
Yeah, well...
Can' t we jump out of aplane?
There' s plenty of air in the containers.
They won' t sink.
A Hercules only flies at 100 km an hour.
It' s not dangerous to jump from.
The accident Vuk causes...
How do we do that?
Well... We' iljust think of something.
It' s not aproblem.
A really ingenious plan.
Really well thought up.
- You never say anything.
- What should I say?
It' s okay.
Boeing 737- 300.
They build them in Seattle.
No, wait a second.
It won' t work.
I don' t know what' s wrong.
Sorry.
It doesn' t matter.
Has it happened before?
I haven' t done it much.
Only with you and my mom.
That' s against the law.
It was in Sweden.
What was your mother like?
Good, I think.
I don' t have anyone to compare her with.
She movedwhen I was twelve.
Didn' t she die when you were nine?
Yes, she did.
You' re so nice.
I thought of seeing apsychologist.
I don' t know if it' s necessary.
You shouldn' t see apsychologist.
Or I will too.
You' re just shy.
You just need to relax.
I care aboutyou so much.
I thought about whatyou said about getting married.
Dan promised to marry me all the time.
But I will.
Do you want to?
Stop it!
You shouldn' t say it for fun.
Look at me.
It' s not funny.
Wouldyou marry me?
Are you serious?
There' s aplane to Brazil on Tuesday.
We can get married there.
Okay?
Damn it!
I don' t have any money.
Didyou say money?
I' ve got that.
You do?
Good.
Then we' il go.
Peter?
- I' m coming now.
- How long can it take?
Are you coming?
Press again!
Here.
The ticket.
Take good care of it.
Get going...
- Ratko, come in.
- Harald... {y: i} - How are you doing?
- We' il be there in half an hour.
I' ve set abase so you can supplement ityourself.
- ls it morphine?
- Here' s alittle extra.
He' s abig guy.
I have areally important appointment tonight.
I' il see you later.
- The plane doesn' t go for 4hours.
- It' s good to be early.
- We' re getting married.
- Congratulations.
Have a seat.
Did I mention it' s35degrees Celsius down there?
That' s not aproblem, because...
I bought children' s sun cream.
The money transport is not there... {y: i} - It' s sun block...
- Ludvig?
Why is it always in Finnish?
The money transport is not here.
- How do you feel?
- I feel strange, Harald.
Are you in pain?
- You just need morphine.
- The boy found a girl.
It' s wonderful.
Ease up on the morphine.
It' s not cold medicine.
- Can he even fly?
- It' s pure cotton.
- Red has always suitedyou.
- You' il get another shot.
That one isn' t perfumed.
It' s sun factor 16.
You can use that.
The money transport is here.
{y: i} - I don' t think there' s enough time...
- Ludvig, hello?
The money transport is in place.
It' s okay, right?
Talk to him.
I don' t understand a thing.
It' s perfumed, but it' s been tested...
- Vuk?
Hello?
What' s that idiot doing?
{y: i} - Vuk, where are you?
- I' m hurrying.
How much money?
Are the charges ready?
- You press on this.
- Start the engine.
{y: i} - Vuk?
- Where is Vuk?
His flight is boarding.
Vuk?
Where the hell are you?
Are we ready?
What is he doing?
He' s supposed to be under the wing.
He' s in line at the stairs.
To the plane.
{y: i} Vuk, get out of thatplane!
{y: i} What are you doing?
- Go over under that wing.
- I just want apicture.
We' re alongway from our gate.

{y: i} Here was Troy 3000 years ago, {y: i} a city of destiny... {y: i}... so situated that it dominated {y: i} the Hellespont... {y: i}... today known as the Dardanelles.
{y: i} This was the only sea route {y: i} to and from the east.
{y: i} As a result, Troy grew prosperous... {y: i}... a tempting prize of war {y: i} for the Greek nations.
{y: i} The Trojans had long memories of the {y: i} time when the Greeks, led by Sparta... {y: i}... had pillaged and burned {y: i} the city of their fathers.
{y: i} They had prepared strong defenses {y: i} against the possibility of future assault.
{y: i} That is why new Troy, {y: i} their rebuilt city... {y: i}... was guarded by mighty walls, {y: i} an impregnable shelter... {y: i}... for a happy people in love with beauty.
{y: i} In the palace square {y: i} and the busy streets... {y: i}... the industrious citizens were enjoying {y: i} the works of peace... {y: i}... as though this carefree era {y: i} would last forever.
{y: i} There was Lord Aeneas, {y: i} nephew of King Priam... {y: i}... on his way to the palace... {y: i}... where the future of Troy {y: i} was being weighed by the royal council.
And so we' ve locked out the understanding of nations...... and we' ve locked in the poison.
Trojans jumping at every rumor...... pointing fingers at each other.
I tell you there' s only one solution.
Have your way.
Go to Sparta.
Go wherever you will...... but don' t try to drag the destiny of Troy with you.
What destiny, to live like a crab in a shell?
That' s our blood.
We' il choke on our own fat unless we sail our ships of trade.
But how can we, when every harbor is an enemy' s?
- Oh, I' m sick of your crazy dreams.
- Careful, brother.
Paris has always been able to crack your neck.
And you can thrash us both.
- Tell him he' s a fool, Hector!
- My sons...... the fool is the man who makes a quarrel of a debate.
Paris, I bless your plan to sail to Sparta.
I know I can trust you not to beg for peace.
I' d convince them.
I' d take 100 ships of war and burn the soil of Sparta black!
I' m sure you would, Polydorus, and create endless war.
-... but to excel at swordplay and boxing?
The javelin and the discus.
Hector' s a good son, Priam.
And a good husband, my lord.
Is that not sufficient glory?
By your leave, Paris' ship is ready to sail.
Do the gods approve the day and the hour?
The omens are good and also the prophecies, with but one exception.
One troubled priestess of the temple.
- My daughter.
- Don' t be angry, Priam.
- Cassandra is ill.
- Sick in the mind.
Arise, Paris...... and go.
The virgin Cassandra does make one point that causes me much concern.
- Aphrodite.
- I' m not sure I worship anything.
No.
Admiration is the better word.
Admiration for the beauty of a marble image.
It was not the goddess of beauty who taught us to arm against our enemies...... but Athena, the goddess of wisdom...... and the patroness of the horses of war.
This solitary adoration of yours.
Neither is she delighted that you undertake a mission of peace.
Very well.
Let it come, my lord...... if that' s the price of living in a world of fables.
Do not say that, Paris.
Do not seek peace elsewhere, dear brother...... until first you have pacified Athena.
My little Cassandra, there can be no postponement.
Give me your blessing for a happy voyage.
Cassandra!
- Cassandra, stop this.
- But, Father, it' s true.
What I see and feel is true.
Go, Paris.
Come, Cassandra.
- Come and rest a while.
- How can I, Mother?
Oh, I wish it hadn' t been given me...... this agony I live with.
Paris, don' t go.
- I must sail at once.
- If you have any love for Troy...... don' t bring this dreadful thing upon us.
- And I thought you loved me best of all.
- I do, but...... the noise, the storm grows so great.
The screaming of horses, the cries of dying men.
- Take care of her.
- My dear, my dear.
Perhaps it could not be otherwise.
What must be, no one can change.
Where are we today?
Far from it.
We' re nearing Sparta...... a harsh military land, where a man will cut off his arm to prove he' s brave.
- I wonder what the women look like.
- My profound Cousin Aeneas.
To think deeply, Paris, one must think of women.
- They sway the destinies of men.
- Not my destiny.
What' s the matter?
Oh, just a quickening of the breeze.
But I don' t like the hot breath of it.
Oh, it' s nothing.
Only one drifting cloud up there.
Up the mast with you!
Climb the mast!
- Drop the sail!
My prince, the ropes are fouled, and these men refuse to climb the mast.
- I' il flay them!
There' s only one way to cure these fantasies.
No!
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Megas!
Aphrodite.
What?
Some ship had bad luck.
She does exist.
- The fairest goddess.
This creature is crazy.
But with a nice sort of craziness.
What was your ship?
{y: i} The Dolphin...
-... of Troy.
- A Trojan.
Cut him loose, Andros.
Maybe we can warm some life into him before we turn him over to the soldiers.
Women!
Why warm a man to cut his throat?
Cover him up, quickly.
We' re looking for our sovereign lady, the Queen of Sparta.
- My lady.
- I left orders not to be disturbed here.
But there are certain developments which make this beach unsafe today.
A strange ship was sighted running out of the storm.
Heavy seas.
She might have been Trojan.
It' s possible she left spies.
You see Trojan phantoms everywhere.
- This was no phantom ship.
- The emblem of the royal House of Troy.
The king would want me to insist that his queen return at once.
lnform King Menelaus that Cora is taking excellent care of me.
Go along now.
Very well, my lady.
Andraste!
- A man, my lady?
How interesting!
- Yes.
What if he' s a warrior and only pretending?
You must be careful.
Women who are always careful miss much in life, Andraste.
He doesn' t seem to recover.
But his heart beats.
- Good.
- Oh, no!
They' il kill him.
- I still say good.
-... if he were as unattractive as you.
To whom am I indebted for this gallant defense?
Nobody of importance.
I am only a slave.
Now tell us about yourself, Trojan.
Did I mention that?
My memory is clouded.
But I do recall I thought you a vision.
A goddess.
Dear Aphrodite...... allow me to present myself.
- Prince Paris of Troy.
- We' il dispense with impudence.
You' re a bit impudent yourself for whatever you are, a slave?
- Silence!
You' re addressing -- - A slave of the palace, Andros.
Of what importance is that?
I come to offer a treaty of peace to King Menelaus.
But of course, you don' t believe me.
My articles of identity...... all the gifts I was bringing to the Court of Sparta....
My crew won' t come near a Spartan harbor now.
They' il swear the gods hurled lightning at me.
Perhaps I do believe you.
The sea has damaged your appearance, but not your manner.
Follow the coast.
- No.
I still have a mission.
- Do as I tell you!
Our soldiers have a habit of plunging a dagger into strangers.
And why should that worry you?
The feelings of a slave are of no importance.
They are to me.
In any place but Sparta, one so fair would be a queen.
In Troy, we' d make songs about you.
King Menelaus would not permit that here.
Because you' d make his queen look plain.
She owns me.
I' m her shadow.
And I always thought I knew her.
-... including Helen.
- Not even the king?
Great power doesn' t need knowledge.
Wait.
-... because I must go to the palace.
- Don' t chance it.
I intend to be discreet, so prepare me.
I --
Oh, if you were old and ugly, maybe then she could help you.
But you' re not old, nor ugly.
It' s late, Andros.
We must get the fish to market.
Gladly.
If the soldiers find him here, I don' t want to be involved.
I wouldn' t mind.
We must get back to the palace, Andraste.
I' ve stayed here too long.
Promise me...... we' il meet again.
You can go back now.
Supplies, for your voyage home.
More than ever.
The kings of Greece are gathering there to consider a war against Troy.
Then my mission was well- timed.
- When will they be in council?
- Tomorrow, perhaps.
But tonight...... there are only you and l.
Under the magic of the moonlight.
See what I brought you?
My dear little slave girl...... I don' t want what you steal from the palace.
I only want what I steal from the palace.
No, my prince.
Very well, then, I' il borrow you.
But we' il be quite honest about it.
That would mean death!
I' il explain to her that you' re no slave to me...... but my future Princess of Troy.
Let me go, Paris.
Don' t you believe I could love a slave?
Yes, I believe.
My heart believes and loves you.
My heart is yours, Paris, but I can never be.
You must not seek out the queen, nor anyone at the palace.
And this moment must be our last.
Don' t ask me why.
Call it magic, call it a dream.
And never speak of it to anyone.
Hear our Spartan host, King Menelaus.
- Are you sure Ulysses is coming?
- His ship was not far behind mine.
He' s so sick of war, he wouldn' t let go of the plow.
Till his child was cast in front of it, to convince him Greece' s glory...... comes before contentment.
You can have the glory.
I' il take Troy' s gold.
Not my share, brother.
Ulysses, King of lthaca!
Greetings, friend.
You' re acquainted with everyone.
Diomedes, ruler of Aetolia.
And I think you know my brother, King Agamemnon of Mycenae.
Greetings, fellow pirates.
It is a righteous war we plan, Ulysses...... a war of defensive aggression.
A neat sort of righteousness.
Have you heard of Priam' s sons?
Polydorus begs for war!
Hector wants only a challenge.
You believe they want peace?
But he hates my brother and me --
He hates you almost as much as he loves war.
In order to lock himself from all temptation of joining with us...... he hid himself securely, in a house of women.
That' s where I found him, hiding from all persuasion...... dressed as a woman!
Yes.
He' s here at the stables, seeing to the care of his horses.
Achilles, a blushing girl.
I shall commend him for the beauty of his face and figure.
The man who blows his own horn.
Commend him, Menelaus.
I commend you, Achilles.
And I despise you.
And you, Agamemnon.
But it seems we must unite...... so I am here to lead you.
- Lead us, Achilles?
I and my good friend Patroclus.
Since we were boys, we could stand alone and defy an army.
I, Ajax.
My imitator.
You disgusting glory- hunter.
To imitate him, I' d need to wear three layers of armor.
That' s where he gets his reputation for being invulnerable.
Silence this fool, Menelaus.
I would prefer not to be angered by him.
The truth of the matter is, his skin' s as tender as his vanity.
And especially his heel.
- He can' t even stand leather against it.
Take your ease, my prince.
I' il handle this buffoon.
We must remain united.
lmpossible.
We' ve never been united, and we never will be.
Keep my horses ready.
Patroclus, we shall leave.
I see no ethical purpose for a raid on Troy.
- Now, wait.
Wait.
You talk of ethics.
Here' s the sign of a Trojan ship prowling our shores.
No peaceful trader, but a royal ship of the House of Priam.
It was my ship, sire.
- Yes.
Sorry to present myself like this, I was swept overboard in the storm.
Fortunately, this gathering of the most royal of Greece...... makes my mission easier.
- How' d you know we were here?
- I beg my lord' s indulgence, I know.
So I' m saved from journeying to each king...... if you decide against offers of peace I bring from Troy.
- Troy does not plan war?
You are wrong, Menelaus.
Stop this or lose your Trojan plunder.
- He came to the palace.
- I thought you' d question him.
- You interrupt council!
- This is our business.
He' s only some wandering vagabond.
See the rags he wears.
These roving jesters come often to my palace.
And they never fail to have some nimble talent.
What do you do besides this royal imposture?
It seems I try to do the impossible.
The cesti.
If he' s Paris, he should have some skill with the cesti.
- Brilliant, brother, brilliant.
- You heard, Ajax, Achilles?
Achilles is weary from travel.
Achilles did not make his reputation fighting children.
This Sparta, my son, is a viper' s nest.
- I' il see you aren' t -- - If we offend the pretender...
-... I give him leave to go.
After all, part of my task was to spread civilization.
But I must exact an agreement.
If I come fairly out of this fight, will you believe that I am Paris...... and hear the Trojan peace terms?
If your head' s still on your shoulders, yes.
Paris!
My good Trojan, you have used a Spartan persuasion on me: courage.
My courage almost failed me at the thought of meeting Ajax.
You shall rest.
And tomorrow we shall talk.
About your adventures, your voyage...... and the secret charm that makes me call you "friend."
And Troy shall call Sparta "friend."
Alpheus, find quarters for our guest.
And, Alpheus...... they say the Trojans have great eyes for beauty.
Find him a slave and see that she is beautiful.
There is one slave in your palace for whom I' d gladly become a slave myself.
Menelaus!
You expressed a wish yesterday to present your guests to me.
Helen, Queen of Sparta, wife to Menelaus...... I present Paris, Prince Royal of Troy.
Why are you here, Trojan?
To study our arts and culture?
Yes, my lady.
The art of self- preservation.
Trojan impudence!
By your leave, my lord...... I shall receive the Greeks at some happier moment.
I heard my lady was truly Spartan this afternoon.
My heart behaved like a fool.
I' m sure Menelaus could hear it beating.
Tell your servants to go.
You may go.
- When will you learn?
The man can neither speak nor hear.
What did you think of the Trojan?
- You saw what I thought.
- Yes, I saw what you thought.
Of this Trojan anyway.
What is this game you' re playing?
Helen, you reveal yourself.
So does he.
Speak plainly.
If I' ve given you some offense, punish me...... but don' t welcome a stranger with one hand and strike him with the other!
So now we' re fond of Trojans?
I might do many things with him.
I might send him home...... with his appearance altered.
I might hold him hostage to bleed tribute out of Priam.
- You married a king.
- I married a robber.
Why did you marry him?
When a king takes spoils, he robs no one.
When he kills, he commits no murder.
He fulfills justice.
The way of a Spartan.
You do not.
I understand enough.
Then understand your place in the palace, nowhere else!
Admit it.
Your silence condemns you.
You' ve been out of the palace secretly.
You know this man.
No words for me, your husband.
I am your husband!
- Say "husband" to me.
Say "husband" to me.
I can think of many ways of dealing with your Trojan, Helen.
Andraste.
I am the slave sent to the Prince of Troy.
The queen' s handmaiden, eh?
The king commands me to entertain his guests.
A fine Greek custom, but guest?
He' s in a prison, if he only knew it.
Oh, I' m instructed that he shall not know it.
Must King Menelaus command you himself to admit me?
The royal temper' s already running a fever.
Shall I tell the king you said that?
Get to your business, you little troublemaker.
You should be in bed.
Yes, I should but --
But your mistress sent you to play another trick on me.
She sent me to help you escape.
Escape?
Those two soldiers on watch down there...... are they going to help me too?
You' re a captive.
The king plans tortures for you.
You must leave quickly.
Return to the fisherman' s hut.
I' il go a distance with you to point the way.
My good friend Menelaus.
- Then what chance have I?
Helen thought to make you look like a merchant.
Any fool could see you' re a prince.
- Soldiers.
- Fisherman!
Yes?
- What do you want?
- A cup of wine.
- Our throats are salted by the breeze.
Cora, the wineskin.
The captain' s an idiot.
Does he think the man will swim?
Here.
Take it with you.
Go, and remember, there will be soldiers above...... so you' d best try the rocks under the cliff.
Get to a cove beyond the tower.
There, a boat will send you to the ship.
Wings of Mercury speed you.
Why do you wait?
It was just a foolish hope.
- I half- imagined she' d come.
She sent you garments...... arranged for a Phoenician ship to take you home.
What more, Trojan?
I didn' t really expect her to come.
- I only hoped.
If she should show her face here and be recognized....
I know.
And I wish I could repay you for your kindness.
And for the queen...... tell her she' il walk in all my dreams.
Wait!
The ship is not yet in the cove.
Helen.
Andraste, you are free.
- Go as far away as you can from Sparta.
You made clear to Adelphus what I said?
- He is far off by this time.
- Then be on your way.
Freedom is made of quicksilver sometimes.
Go.
Hurry.
Helen.
Helen is the queen.
The girl you thought you knew was quite nameless and without reality.
I can' t believe that.
- It was she who helped me to escape.
That was the queen who hates cruelty.
I see.
She is the queen who comes here to say this.
She will always remember the gentle Paris.
And she will do her small part to turn this nation from war.
- You' re not a Spartan.
- I am.
A man you despised.
I despise oppression, as do many others here.
We need to be Spartan to endure it.
And we need to be understood.
You, not Menelaus, will be Sparta to me.
I' il tell Troy what I' ve seen and heard.
The rulers divided, unable to find cause for war...... even the Spartan people.
Stop worrying.
The kings have been carousing all night.
And so she is real, that one I loved.
Yes.
The gods sometimes change the bravest of intentions.
They are kind.
I' il never doubt them again.
Oh, Helen.
Helen, you are a slave as long as Menelaus possesses you.
Come to Troy with me.
And destroy the hope of peace you were taking home with you?
No.
If even one Trojan dies on the walls, I' m a failure.
Forgive me, Helen.
You are two women, both wise and good.
I am two men.
One fairly good, I try to believe.
The other, very bad indeed.
One is a man.
The other just a boy, I think.
Paris, let him be so always.
Never let him grow old.
Helen.
The ship.
And now I must go back.
It is a way the gods have...... to give with one hand and take with two.
This is not goodbye.
You shall still be with me across the sea.
And you with me.
And always young, Paris, remember?
What is remembered is forever young.
Halt!
Stand still, Trojan.
- My lady, I ask you remove yourself -- - Send your archers away.
I beg the queen to stand out of danger.
You wouldn' t dare.
You' il die.
I can no more than lose my own life, and it' s lost if I let him go.
Silence!
Helen!
Helen!
- You lie.
- No.
Break the locks!
Break.
It' s true.
He' s carried her away.
By force, against her will.
To think of her struggles, her fruitless cries for help.
We had our differences, but she was my wife.
It goes deeper than that.
This is the assault of all women in Greece.
Shame on every Greek nation.
Then man your ships.
Follow them.
She must be restored to me.
- Not now, Menelaus.
- Yes.
Now, now, now!
Will you not stand with me?
Menelaus, we will reclaim her, and with her, all the loot of Troy.
But only if you wait.
We' il send out a call to every city in Greece.
All Greeks united in a war of honor.
That' s what the future will call it.
I call it that now.
This Prince of Troy has asked for war, not peace.
I' m sure you' il agree with me that it is my duty to become our leader.
Leader?
I' il see no one but Achilles as leader.
It is my consecrated duty to become our leader to avenge my dear brother.
Quite, quite, Agamemnon.
And I will follow you.
And tell you what to do, as usual.
And I will persuade the sensitive Achilles...... with certain fascinating facts...... about the great store of gold to be found in Troy.
I seek no treasure.
I will kill.
So shall we all, brother.
To defend your honor.
Who are they?
I don' t know, but I know the color of their gold.
Sparta is the past, Helen.
Troy is this way.
What will they call us there?
A woman who left her husband.
A prince turned thief.
What else can we ever be?
Two people in love.
Against the world, if need be.
If I could make a bargain with the gods...... we would escape the world...... never landing on any shore.
A lovely dream, but somewhere we must land.
Paris, there' s an island called Pelagos.
And there are little houses near the village well.
Let' s go there.
I cannot.
I was born to an obligation.
Paris, son of Priam, heir to responsibility.
I could leave the kingdoms of the world and never miss them.
- But you -- - Helen...... our life together will fade if I run from this.
It will become a slight thing that any storm can tear apart.
No, Paris.
Forgive me.
I forget you are a woman, not a goddess.
Captain.
- You know the island of Pelagos?
- It' s far southward...
-... through the Cytherean straits.
- Sail southward.
- Captain.
- Yes?
We have decided otherwise.
Sail north to Troy.
- What is it?
- You' il have to see, Lord Aeneas.
Wait.
Aeneas, call the queen.
Paris!
Paris.
Come and meet my brothers.
Hector, Polydorus.
I told you about them.
Lucky Paris.
You could fall in the black pit of Hades...... and come out with arms full of sunshine.
He' s always had a fine flair for surprises.
I' m happy to see that you diverted your mission...... to an enterprise more to your talents.
Come.
- Aeneas.
- Paris.
- Paris.
- I should have had faith.
-... and with him our hopes of peace.
- It' s a miracle.
Tell us what happened, Paris.
Here is your miracle.
I would never have seen Troy again but for her.
It would have taken a sea sprite to save you.
How could one so tender have managed it?
Postpone your questions.
She suffered an ordeal that I shan' t relate in her presence.
It' s enough that our son has been given back to us by you, my dear.
You are welcome, my child.
See that she is made comfortable.
At your command, Father.
My brother seems to have forgotten his courtliness.
By what name, my lady, shall we know you?
- My name is -- - Her name is death.
- Cassandra!
- Forgive her.
She suffers an illness.
Wait.
You were going to say?
I am Helen, Queen of Sparta.
The wife of King Menelaus?
- His wife no more.
- The goddess of beauty, Aphrodite...... come down to Earth in mortal form.
She will bring the disaster I have prophesied.
Helen.
Helen of Troy.
And she saved my life again...... but at such risk to herself that I couldn' t leave her...... to the mercy of the Spartans.
I can see I' ve troubled you, sire.
But in your affection for me and mine for you...... I hope you will judge me fairly.
I would never have believed that this could happen...... not through this son of mine.
Who promised he would bring it.
And what have you brought?
Dishonor.
You have united the Greeks.
You have kindled a flame that will weld them together against us.
This will bring them to our very shores.
That should delight you.
You may have to answer for the death of many a good Trojan.
You have presumed too much upon our affection.
Paris...... send her back to Sparta and make your peace with Menelaus.
I' il never send her back.
- You reject every word of wisdom?
- My love has no logic.
It could only choose between Troy and Pelagos.
Helen wanted to go to Pelagos...... but I had to bring you the warning.
And she had the courage to come with me.
There is no heart in Troy.
We' il seek it elsewhere.
The coward' s way to avoid the fight?
- You exceed the rights of a brother.
You scorn every Trojan duty.
The damage is done.
It matters not.
- I shall not see you again.
- Priam.
Bring to the council chamber the armory masters and the granary stewards.
Tell them I want an estimate of Troy' s ability to withstand a siege.
There were times when I almost forgot that I had other children, Paris...... others to die, perhaps.
Destiny, Paris.
Every Trojan woman with son or husband will curse you.
Well, don' t worry, brother, a war may clear the atmosphere.
War, the only thing that could make you happy.
Keep out of my way, or you' il never live to enjoy it.
- Lord Aeneas.
- You may go.
The ship that brought you to Troy is still in the harbor.
My charioteer will take you there.
I see.
Or if my lady prefers, I' il arrange for a royal escort.
No, I won' t delay.
Wait for us.
My chariot will be in the courtyard.
Athena wields much power, it seems.
- If I return to Menelaus -- - No.
Yes, I' il take you to Pelagos.
You said our lives would fade if you ran away.
I also said that you' d be happy in Troy.
Paris, the word has spread.
- They are not armed with flowers.
- Quick, before they overrun the courtyard.
They won' t as long as they enjoy their carnival.
- Take Helen to the harbor.
- Don' t show yourself to them.
- See her aboard the ship.
My brave Trojans...... will you show as much spirit against the Spartan army...... as against one Spartan woman?
Can you stand alone, each, in battle...... or do you need the cowardice of numbers to make you bold?
Go home and search your hearts, Trojans...... for all this must be answered soon.
- You can leave safely now.
- Without you?
I' ve gained a victory of a sort tonight.
I mustn' t lose it, Helen.
There' s no Pelagos if I' m there alone.
But there' s always one island where the storm can' t touch us.
It' s anyplace, Paris, where we' re together.
- Here?
- Oh, yes, even here.
{y: i} News reached Troy {y: i} that the Greeks were about to sail... {y: i}... with the mightiest armada ever known {y: i} to man.
The Trojans prepared for war.
- That' s all right.
- Hundreds.
- Many more than we can count.
- Five, 600.
- No less than 1000 ships.
- We' il make them pay a heavy price.
What shall we pay?
Aeneas, bring them here.
Let them see.
Yes, sire.
Faster.
Faster.
- Father.
The face that launched 1000 ships.
Now remember, these Trojan walls are our strength and our substance...... so let no eager fool attempt to charge this plain...... until these ramparts have served their purpose.
Well, to your posts.
Hector, where is my place?
Beside your Spartan woman.
Come with me, brother.
I' il share Spartan blood with you.
You can have my share.
No Trojans to greet us?
I had hoped they' d be foolish enough to scatter their forces.
- Where do we make camp, Agamemnon?
No, onwards.
Every moment of delay, my Helen suffers.
Our camp is the Trojan palace.
We must attack at once.
Against Troy' s walls, Achilles?
We must equip to take this fortress.
Ulysses is right.
We must prepare.
{y: i} The canny counsel of Ulysses prevailed.
{y: i} The Greeks consolidated their beachhead {y: i} and built machines for attack... {y: i}... on a scale big enough {y: i} to match the Trojan walls.
Follow Achilles!
Hector.
- To the ramps.
Back!
- We' re outflanked!
Return to your towers.
To the ramps.
Back!
Polydorus.
It' s a good war, Paris.
Hector, the man of peace...... now our greatest warrior.
Thank Helen for your destiny.
- Thank Paris.
- I thank him for my life.
Oh, great Zeus, king of all...... we give to you Polydorus, Prince of Troy.
I pray you, judge him with compassion and understanding.
Let not Athena' s hatred feed on my defenseless son...... but on our sorrow here.
We, the living dead of Troy, shall pay his debt...... in the years of siege to come.
{y: i} And the Greeks did prepare {y: i} for years of siege.
{y: i} They unloaded provisions {y: i} from their ships... {y: i}... and as time went on {y: i} they looted and raped... {y: i}... the small surrounding villages.
Take your hands off her!
- A warrior commanding his commander?
- She' s mine.
Great as you are, I' m still your chieftain, protector of all the spoils of war.
- Take her to my quarters.
Agamemnon, if you take this girl, I shall sail home.
Fly.
- Agamemnon!
- Sail home, great warrior.
No, Achilles.
Out!
Achilles, Agamemnon does not speak for all our people.
Dogs!
Jackals!
I' il never fight his battles again.
But for Greece, you' il fight.
No more.
{y: i} During these years of stalemate, {y: i} the Trojans... {y: i}... from the safety of their walls, {y: i} constantly harassed the invaders... {y: i}... with night raids on their camps.
- Helen, how perfect.
- The girl you fell in love with?
Always keep that image with you, Paris.
I shan' t need to.
I have the source of its magic.
Right here, I hold its living warmth...... and its spirit is always with me on the ramparts.
Then it can' t be lost, can it?
What has been lived and shared is never lost.
- Never, Helen.
- But if you should lose me...... could you resign yourself to that?
Don' t worry, nothing will happen to you.
Nothing endures on Earth, Paris, neither sorrow nor happiness...... or people in love.
Dear Helen, she looks for shadows in the one bright place in Troy.
People in love should not be blind.
They should look to the future and prepare for separation.
But not so gloomily, my love.
I' il meet you in Elysium...... where an age of years is just a wink of time.
I' il take the flying horse, Pegasus.
To our island, Paris?
Oh, goddess come to Earth, make me immortal with your kiss...... and we' il live on nectar and ambrosia.
- But I' m not sure I like being so ethereal.
How many years, fellow Trojans, shall we suffer?
Our only respite, a truce to burn our dead.
The holiday of a Troy that once knew happy times.
Must the Trojans always set their funeral pyre so near this house?
- They lost many loved ones, my lady.
I thought I could escape from it, but there is no place --
- And no victory for anybody.
- Go.
Paris commanded me to stay with you while he' s on duty.
Leave me, I tell you.
Cast Paris out of Troy.
- If you haven' t the fiber for this....
Their mood is dangerous.
I' ve sent soldiers to disperse them.
- You' ve come to ask me to leave Troy.
No.
But for Paris, I would have lost Hector.
I must love my sons equally...... and whomsoever they love.
You are good.
The high priest says that even the gods fight each other.
Some for Athena and Greece, some for Troy and Aphrodite.
How, then, could I blame you for this war?
- I could stop it.
- No one could.
I could...... if I return to the Greeks, to Menelaus.
Go back to someone you so despise?
If it brings an end to war and restores Paris to the love of the Trojans....
- He' d never let you go.
- And could I ever leave him?
- You must help me to decide.
- Would you defy the Fates?
No mortal should attempt so much, Helen.
And yet I wonder...... is one so lovely quite mortal?
Lovely?
I am everything I was determined not to be.
I have only been selfish.
All the despair, the pain and the tears I' ve brought.
How different from that island dream.
Return to your King of Troy...... and tell him we will receive Helen at the appointed place.
But warn him there must be no treachery or deceit.
It is her wish to return to King Menelaus.
You hear that, brother?
- I' ve heard it often.
Wait, herald.
Tell your master from Menelaus that we demand --
Nothing else.
Nothing else, only the return of Helen.
The Trojans wish to make peace.
As men of peace, we accept their offer.
Have we suffered to return empty- handed?
Empty- handed, Menelaus?
With Helen returned, integrity satisfied?
You are too outspoken, brother.
When the Trojans have handed over Helen, we' il teach them...... that we' re not easily bought off.
But I' d like Achilles with us, in case they prove troublesome.
He still refuses to fight so long as you' re in command...... and your lovesick jackass of a brother brays upon this beach.
Then he' il get not one obol of Trojan tribute.
Helen?
Helen.
- Where is she?
- She' s not here, Paris.
Not here?
Where?
She' s gone to the camp of the Greeks.
To Menelaus?
She was determined to end the destruction...... and restore you to the hearts of the Trojans.
- And you conspired with her -- - She was not a captive here, Paris...... but a woman of self- determination, a queen with more courage...... than I would have had to sail against the tides of heaven.
- He shan' t take her.
You can' t prevent it.
Wait, Trojans.
You' ve returned the wife of Menelaus, but that isn' t all your debt.
Debt?
- We recognize no claim of debt.
Then who pays for the Greek blood shed on this plain?
Trojan blood has paid in full.
Trojan blood is not valid currency in Sparta...... nor does it pay for launching 1000 ships.
The terms of this truce were clear.
The return of Helen, in exchange for which...... you agreed to sail from these shores.
- You trusting fools.
- Two things only will suffice:
Half the treasury of Troy before we depart...... and after that, 1000 talents every year.
Take these nobles as security!
- Here' s payment, Menelaus!
Bring her back to Troy!
After them!
Back!
Turn back!
Don' t go too close to the Trojan walls.
Not against Hector.
- Bring me my armor.
- Yes, master.
Thank you, Trojan, for bringing us the body of Patroclus.
Thank you very much.
My son, Greek treachery has proved that theirs is not a war of honor.
Helen, through you, we have learned that they seek plunder, not justice.
I ask forgiveness of you both.
Cassandra...... we have found there is great wisdom in you.
- What more can you tell us?
- New storms shall ride the sky...... but the guilt will be Athena' s, not Helen' s.
- Thank you, Cassandra.
- Such courage must not go unrewarded.
Helen, you will be a princess of Troy.
Where is Hector and Andromache?
They are to bestow the laurels.
Where is Hector?
He anticipates a call to single combat for the death of Patroclus.
I killed him.
Any Greek challenge would come to me.
But Hector didn' t want you to be challenged by Achilles.
- Hector sent him his friend' s corpse...... with personal compliments.
No one can match Achilles, not even Hector.
This must not happen.
He cried like an animal in grief, my lord, and then called for his armor.
Ah, so he comes.
Hector!
- It is done, Andromache.
- Achilles?
By his hand, my father and my brothers fell.
- While you live, I still have them in you.
- I intend to live, Andromache, for you...... and for our son.
This helmet always frightens him.
Let' s pray that he may never need one...... that he finds peace.
Arms to bear.
If Achilles wins, we move.
We strike at once!
To the palace!
And if Achilles dies, we retire to consider a certain plan of mine.
- There' s an immortal shield around him.
- Mighty Zeus, help me find a weakness.
Achilles is dead!
So dies Greek courage, but not Greek cunning.
Defeated by men, deserted by the gods.
I used to number the months by a battle, a pestilence, a famine.
Now it' s all one long nightmare.
I fought wars since most of you were sucklings, but never one like this.
Let' s take our ships and sail back home.
That we shall do.
I have a plan that first required a Trojan victory.
- That much, at least, is accomplished.
- You speak treason.
As you will, but let' s be realistic.
The greatest army on Earth has lost its war.
What are you dreaming, Ulysses?
I' m dreaming of my wife, the good, constant Penelope.
And in my dreams, I see myself returning to her with all the treasures of Troy.
- But how?
- Has this anything to do with the work...... that Apagos and his men have been doing in the woodlands?
They' re building a monument to the triumph of Paris and Helen.
A gift from the goddess Athena.
A sacred horse, so big and so beautiful...... that Troy cannot help taking it to her heart.
Remember, blow the retreat loud enough for Troy to hear.
Let the ships sail but keep sufficient force in the woodlands.
The ships will return at dawn.
Are you sure the Trojans will take this monstrosity into the city?
I promise.
Their gratitude to Athena for her victory will be tremendous.
And they' il give a loving welcome to her wondrous horse.
And to Bacchus, the god of grapes.
Make ready, men of Greece!
First they sounded retreat, and now the call to man the oars.
Their torches are moving back to the sea.
- We' il soon know.
Lord Aeneas has gone to the shore with scouts.
Sire, they' ve sailed.
The last of their ships has gone to sea.
Carry it through the streets.
Good, Priam.
- Our heroes would wish us to rejoice.
- Light the victory torch!
You' il see a Troy you' ve never known before.
I see it in your faces.
Open it!
Let us look at the world again!
The night smiles on us.
Look, Priam.
I was trying to tell you of it, sire.
Some strange monument that the Greeks have left at our doorstep.
Beware the Greeks bearing gifts.
My sister speaks truly.
It is a thing of evil that should be burnt upon the plain.
The enemy doesn' t give joyful presents.
My children, this is no gift from the Greeks...... but a symbol of worship they had to abandon.
Sire, the people beg permission to bring this amazing prize into the square.
They have fought long and bravely.
I cannot deny them.
Father, please hear me.
It is not the end of ruin, but the beginning.
We must not be ungrateful...... to a goddess who has proved herself our goddess.
Bring in her sacred horse.
Yes, sire.
It is a great and perfect thing.
How childish I was to have misgivings.
And I to be afraid of a wooden giant.
What was that for?
Athena.
So forgiving of a rival goddess.
Are you jealous, Aphrodite?
I' m only Helen...... who wonders if she' il ever be a Trojan, really.
When the Trojan people look upon that plain...... won' t they always think of Helen of Sparta?
There is peace everywhere now.
We' re not bound to remain here.
Wherever you wish to go, Helen, I' il take you.
Hail to Prince Paris and his Helen!
Hail to Helen!
- All hail to Paris!
Destiny, Paris.
Not even from happiness.
No, and I am happy.
Very happy.
Men of Sparta, to the palace!
Forward!
Troy is lost, but you must not die.
While the Greeks plunder, make for the north gate.
- Or I?
Obey your king.
Aeneas, take care of Andromache and my grandson.
Paris, Helen...... I command you, go.
Magnificent leadership, Agamemnon.
Athena will reward you with all the glory.
All of you, break in!
Helen!
The rest of you, search!
Find her!
- Don' t let me get lost, Paris.
- Never.
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Paris!
Oh, Paris!
I thought I was lost!
The gods are with us.
Come.
Paris!
-... that you were that little slave girl.
- Oh, I am.
Whatever your love wishes me to be, whatever is in your heart.
You are my heart.
Paris.
No.
My ship has returned for you.
Go there.
Wash his blood from you.
That can never be.
It' s my blood.
{y: i} It can 't be lost, Paris, can it?
{y: i} What has been lived {y: i} and shared is never lost.
{y: i} Never, Helen.
{y: i} Then this is not goodbye.
{y: i} You shall always be with me.
{y: i} And you with me.
English Subtitle by Azmodan
They say Japan was made by a sword
They say the old gods dipped the coral blade into the ocean
When they pulled it out four perfect drops fell back into the sea those drops became the islands of Japan
I say Japan was made by a handful of brave men
Warriors willing to give their lives for what seems to have become a forgotten word...
Honor
"The Last Samurai"
Ladies and Gentlemen... the Winchester an American leader in all forms of armament used by the United States Army celebrates our nation' s centenial by bringing you a true American hero.
One of our most decorated warriors this country has ever known... winner of the medal of honor for his gallantry on the arena of battle each time.
He' s late of the seventh cavalry and a triumph campaign... against the most savage of Indian nations.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you...
Captain Nathan Algren.
Captain Nathan Algren!
Yes!
Yes!
God damn you, Algren!
This is your last performance, you are fired.
Now get out!
Come on!
I' m sick of this, come on!
Yes!
My thanks, Mr. McCabe.
You are too kind.
This, ladies and gents, is the gun that' s winning the west.
I... many' s the time, I found myself... surrounded by a squad of wrath...... angry hostiles. with nothing but this rifle, between me and their certain and gruesome death.
But let me tell you folks... the "redman" doesn' t fear his enemy.
If He' d had his way, this scalp of mine will be long gone... and then there will be a bald man standing before you today.
Would those poor bastards attack there... and a little bit more.
Bodies slit about... literally.
after rotted in the sun.
This, ladies and ladies, 73 lever- action... chamber...
7- shot capacity, accurate at 400 yards, one round per second...
Son, you' ve seen what this could do with a man?
It' s blown a hole in your daddy 16 inches wide.
It' s tragic
This beauty, it kills some five, six, seven braves... without ever having to reload.
Note the patented loading port... and the smooth cocking action.
My thanks, on behalf of those who died in the name of better mechanical amusements... and commercial opportunities.
Mr. McCabe, come here to take the orders
God bless you all.
I was seeking out to heat the flame for the old melodrama.
- You are alive.
- I' m indeed.
You mind, Custer said to me, "we' re going to the Little BigHorn since I want those weird stuff to walk into take- up for me."
Now many things happened, I will tell you what else happened.
I have a good job for the both of us.
God knows specially you' re gonna need one for yourself.
What kind of a job?
The only job you will think you are loyal.
A man' s job!
Unless of course you give your heart in the career in the theater.
Nathan!
You just listen to 'em.
Don' t you bother to say.
For a while, it' s good to see you.
Nathan Algren, I would like you to meet Mr. Omura, from Japan. and his associate, his name I' ve given up try to pronounce.
Sit down, please.
Whiskey.
Now Japan' s got that in mind to become a civilized country.
And Mr. Omura here is...... willing to spend whatever it takes to hire a wise expert to train their army.
And he prepared a contract the Emperor grants the U. S... exclusive rights to supply arms.
I have an agreement with the Winchester company, and I am certain that Mr. Omura here has some concept of what an agreement is.
Your performances for the Winchester company bring you $25 a week.
We will pay you $400 a month.
$5 for each. and another $500 when we get the job done.
How many other genuine war heroes you got lined up?
He' s rude
That' s how it is here.
A land of cheap traders.
Whiskey.
So, who will be it - training your boys to fight against?
His name is Kasumoto Moritsu.
He was last Emperor' s teacher.
He is a samurai.
Samurai?
The word you might use it as "warrior"
Mr. Omura is familiar... with our experience in dealing with renegade.
What is it?
It' s going to read your book.
Captain Algren studied of a trial, which was a crucial fact on the defeat of the Cheyennes.
Please excuse
What is funny?
Because... back together again is so...... inspiring
Excuse me
Excuse me.
Sorry for this.
This isn' t a problem
I' il just talk to him for a minute.
Colonel Bagley.
We contacted you because you are Captain Algren' s superior officer... and you' ve assured us of his participation.
I' il do it.
Nathan.
I did what I was ordered to do up there.
And I have no remorse.
What did you see through the past behind us?
I will kill Jappos.
I am not asking you to kill anybody, but the enemy...
Kill the enemy if it is Jappo.
Reb, Sioux, Cheyenne...
For 500 bucks a month, I will kill whoever you want.
But keep one thing in mind...
I' d be happy to kill you for free.
June 12th, 1876.
There is some comfort in the emptiness in the sea.
No past, no future.
And I once am confronted by the hard truth of the present circumstances.
I have been hired to help supress the rebellion of another tribal leader.
Apparently, this is the only job for which I am suited.
I am upset by the ironies of my life.
Yokohama Harbor, 1876
Yes
How do you do?
Simon Graham.
20 years ago, this was a sleepy little town.
Now, look at this.
You see, the emperor is mad for all thing western. and the Samurais believe that it' s changing too fast.
The ancient and the modern are at war for the soul of Japan.
So your new employer, Mr. Omura... is bringing in every western expert he can get his hands on.
Lawyers of France, engineers of Germany... architects of Holland and now of course, warriors of America.
I came when I was with the British legation, know, years ago...
I was soon relieved of my position where I have a long long forest of tendencies to tell the truth... in a country where they never say what they need.
So now, I very accurately translate the other people' s lives.
For 2000 years, no Emperor was even seen by a commoner.
You have to realise this accidental chance is an honor.
This is all highly ritualism, of course.
Unless you are spoken to, obviously.
If he stands, you must bow.
If he bows, you must bow lower.
Do I look presentable?
I' ve wantoned a decade...... on the smart round midgets.
and bow
The Emperor Meiji bids you welcome.
He' s grateful for the assistance your country offers.
We hope to accomplish the same national harmony you enjoy in your homeland.
If you have fought against them in battle?
We have, Your Highness.
The red man is brutal ass.
The Emperor wishes to ask Captain Algren if it is truth that... they wear eagle feathers and paint their faces before going into battle. and then they have no fear.
They are very brave.
Bow
Thank you very much.
Step back step back.. step back and turn.
All right, you little bastards, you should stand up straight in a line... or I will passionately shit- kick every one of you sad parade, let it be before my eyes.
Well done, Sergeant.
When you understand the language, everything is as fast as it takes place.
The first right you' il know: rifles at the ready.
July 27th, 1876.
For six months of work, I' m to receive...... 3 years of a Captain' s pay, teaching oriental soldiers.
They are army of conscription... most of them are peasants, who have never seen a gun.
Fire!
They are led by General Hasegawa... a man of small stature and nonetheless commands enormous respect.
What can General tell me about this man, this samurai...
- Katsumoto.
He seems to have great knowledge of Katsumoto, his rebellion.
I' il count on his help when facing this samurai.
Who supply them with weapons?
Katsumoto no longer dishonours himself by using firearms.
He uses no firearms?
Those honor the old way, Katsumoto is a hero.
How well does he know this man?
Well, the General and Katsumoto fought together for the Emperor.
He fought with the samurai?
He is a samurai.
You have to understand Katsumoto pledged the sword to defend the Emperor.
They say the samurai' s sword is his soul.
They are paradoxical people, samurai.
I' ve tried to write a book about them for years...
I seeked in vain to approach them close.
The bastards still wear armor.
I need more detailed information of their battle tactics.
I have several more books just waiting to be translated.
Our captain will be speaking the language of theirs.
You should' ve heard him babbling on the Blackfoot.
Really?
A fellow linguist?
Oh, Capital!
Oh come on Sir, a word or two is very fun.
Just "hello" or "Goodbye".
No, No.. Cut its tongue and boil in the oil.
Early this morning we have a dull work. so it is bed time, isn' t it?
I once had a dread fascination for scalp.
I never understood its technique.
Imagine someone who hates you with the uppermost intensity.
Grabbing in hand full of your hair while you are lying prostrate and helpless.
And scraping a dull blade of a rusted knife on your scalp... with the soulless emotion.
and let your imagination grasp you can, Mr. Graham, the effect of a strong, quick jerk- out on the turf of your hair. to release clinging part, of course you have, of your nervous system.
You will have some idea of what the hell it is to be scalped.
Mr. Graham.
How soon can you translate those books?
Right away.
Just delighted to do it, with your such an interest in Samurai.
I don' t give a damn about the Samurai.
I want to know my enemy.
I shall not sleep until it is done.
Have a good night.
Can I get your answer?
This is a pureness expedition, Captain.
Colonel Bagley, these people have nothing to do with the race.
Good night, Sir.
Fire!
I suppose we should be grateful for our fire army to shoot in the same direction. could not put it better myself, Sir.
Rifle butt against your shoulder.
Eye down the side, now slowly...
Fire!
Nathan...
Katsumoto attacked the railroad in the border of his province. we cannot govern a country in which we cannot travel freely.
He must be stopped now.
My railroad is a priority for this country.
They are not ready.
The rebels don' t have a single rifle.
They' re savages with bows and arrows. whose sole occupation for the last 1000 years has been at war.
You have superior fire power and a larger force.
I am ordering the regiment to move against the rebel Katsumoto.
You will track him down and engage him.
Mr. Graham... tell these men to fire at me.
I beg your pardon?
Tell these men if he does not shoot me...
Kill him
Stop!
Load.
Stop!
Load
Faster!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
They are not ready.
The regiment leaves at 6: 00 A. M.
1, 000 miles of rail track laid in less than 2 years.
It' s astonished.
No more owns all these.
Oh yes.
How do you intend to find Katsumoto?
Don' t worry, Mr. Graham.
Move!
Hold your position!
Yoshino Province, 1876.
First Company, follow up the back line around me!
Second Company, follow up First Company.
Third and Fourth Company follow up!
To be at my command!
- Where is Hasegawa?
- Unclear, he refused to fight against Katsumoto.
- Come on now!
- Captain Algren... we are not here for combatness.
Then who' s gonna lead these men?
Their own officers, for Chris sake, let' s move to the rear.
I' il be present there.
Change for the rear.
Change for the rear.
- Mr. Graham, you' il accompany me to the rear, okay?
- Of course.
Seize the disposition of the supply train.
Sergeant Gant, did you hear my order?
I did hear it, Sir.
Good, then obey it.
Now!
No disrespecting intended, Sir, we should look up our ass.
- Load!
- Load!
Samurai come.
You will be fine, Son.
Fire on my order only!
Hold your fire!
Reload!
Hold the line!
Fire at will!
Fall back!
He' s mine.
Stop!
Take him away.
What is your name?
Insolent swine!
Answer!
Leave him be.
This is my son' s village.
We are deep in the mountains and the winter is coming.
You cannot escape.
It' s surely good.
My Lord, why do you spare the barbarian?
He is ashamed in defeat.
He should kill himself.
This is not their custom.
Then...... I will kill him.
Father...
I don' t think...
Ujio...... there will be plenty of killing to come.
For now...... we will learn about our new enemy.
Keep him alive.
Sake...
Taka will take care of you.
Let him drink, aunt.
No.
That will not do.
This is my village.
This is my house.
Please... sake..
Sugay!
No!
I told you!
Morning.
Over there.
Over there!
You have a name, don' t you?
Naomai?
You don' t know what I' m saying, do you?
You' re angry.
You' re angry because I made you wear a dress.
Son of a bitch.
This temple was built by my family 1, 000 years ago.
My name is Katsumoto.
What is your name?
Are my words not correct?
I will practise my English with you... if you would honor me...
You keep me alive just to speak English?
What do you want?
To know my enemy.
I' ve seen what you did with your enemies.
The warriors in its country do not kill?
They don' t cut their heads off to free the kneeling men.
General Hasegawa asked me to help him end his life.
A samurai cannot stand the shame of defeat.
I was honored to cut off his head.
Many of our customs seem strange to you... and the same is true of yours.
For example...
Not to introduce yourself is considered extremely rude, even among enemies.
Nathan Algren.
I am honored to meet you.
I have enjoyed this conversation in English.
I have questions.
I have introduced myself, you have introduced yourself.
This is a very good conversation.
I have questions!
- Questions come later.
- Who was the warrior in the red armor?
My brother- in- law, Hirotaro. and the woman who cares for me?
My sister, Hirotaro' s wife.
Her name is Taka.
I killed her husband?
It was a good death!
You!
Douzo!
(please!)
He smells like the pigs.
Tell my brother I cannot stand this.
Why don' t you tell him?
At least make him take a bath.
Nicely done!
They may be children, but they are strong.
Fight!
Put down the sword.
I' ve been remiss.
Forgive me I... forget to thank you for looking out for me yesterday.
It' s your job, correct?
Protecting me.
Well done, "Bob".
You don' t mind if I call you "Bobby"?
I knew a Bob once.
God, he' s a grist mill.
You hear this man, Bob?
Ujio was teaching you the way of Japanese sword.
Yes, indeed.
You fought against the red indians?
Yes.
Tell me the real part in this war.
- Why?
- I wish to learn.
Read the book.
I' d rather to have a good conversation.
- Why?
- Because... to read a book constitutes a work.
So... you were the General of your army?
No...
I was a Captain.
This is a lower rank?
a middle rank
Then who was the General?
Don' t you have a rebellion to lead?
People in your country do not like conversation?
He was a Lieutenant- Colonel.
His name is Custer.
I know this name.
He killed many warriors.
Aye.
Many warriors.
So he was a good General.
No, he wasn' t a good General, he was arrogant, foolhardy. and he got massacred because he took a single battallion...... against 2, 000 angry indians.
2, 000 indians?
How many men for Custer?
- 200.
- I like this General Custer.
He was a murderer, who fell in love with his own legend. and his troops died for it.
I think this is a very good death.
Oh, maybe you can have one just like it someday.
If it is my destiny.
What you want from me?
What do you want for yourself?
What are you doing?
Why we have these conversations?
What the hell am I doing here?
In spring, the snow will melt and passage will open.
Until that time, you are here.
1876... day unknown, month unknown.
I continue to live among these unusual people.
I' m a captive and I cannot escape.
Mostly I' m treated with a kind of a mind of regret as if I was a street dog, an unwelcome guest.
Everyone is polite, everyone smiles and bows.
Higen
They are intriguing people.
From the moment they wake... they devote themselves to the perfection of whatever they pursue.
I' ve never seen such a discipline.
I' m surprised to learn that the word "Samurai" means...... "to serve". and Katsumoto believes his rebellion to be in the service of the Emperor.
Please forgive, too many mind.
Too many mind?
Mind the sword, mind the people watch, mind the enemy.
Too many mind.
No mind.
No mind.
Thank you.
More rice?
Taka.
He spoke Japanese!
Don' t polite.
Not so fast.
What is this?
How can he understand?
Hana (Nose)
Not so fast.
Algren.
Brother, please make him leave.
I cannot stand it.
Is he so repulsive?
The shame is unbearable.
I ask permission to end my life.
You will do as you are told!
You' d rather I kill him to avenge your husband?
Yes
Hirotaro tried to kill the American.
It was karma.
Yes, I know
Forgive my weakness.
There must be some reason why he is here.
It is beyond my understanding.
She has been very kind to me.
She is honored to help my guest in her house.
Winter, 1877.
What does it mean to be a Samurai?
To devote yourself utterly to a set of moral principles.
To seek the stillness of your mind.
And to master the realm of sword.
He is getting better, no?
Cold
Watashi nimo samui.
Hi [Japanese]
Moeru
Hidaga moeru
No, please.
Japanese men do not help with this.
I am not Japanese.
I' m sorry gomennasai (Excuse me)
Gomennasai for your husband... Hirotaro.
He did his duty.
You did your duty.
I accept your apology... hahaue (mom)
Spring, 1877.
It is much longer than I have stayed in one place...... since I left the farm at 17.
There are so much here that I will never understand.
I have never been a church- going man.
And what I have seen on the field of battle have left me to question on God' s purpose.
But there is indeed something spiritual in this place.
and though it may forever be obscure to me.
I cannot but be aware of its power.
I do know it is here that I have known my first untroubled sleep in many years.
You gotta get the ball!
Go get it!
Not me
You gotta get the ball! the ball!
Ujio will win in three moves.
In five!
Next in five moves.
In six.
A draw!
Who is this amateur?
Katsumoto!
Protect Katsumoto!
Protect our Lord!
Lord, please go inside!
A perfect blossom is a rare thing.
You could spend your life looking for them... and it will not be a wasted life.
Who sent those men to kill you?
I am writing a poem about a dream I had. the tigers' eyes are like my own.
He comes from across a deep and trouble to see.
Was it the Emperor?
Omura?
If the Emperor wishes my death, he is but to ask.
So it was Omura.
I' m having trouble finishing the poem.
Can you transact a last line?
I am not a writer.
Yes, you have written many pages since you came here.
What has he told you?
You have nightmares.
Every soldier has nightmares.
Only one who is ashamed of what he has done.
You have no idea what I have done.
You have seen many things.
I have.
You do not fear that, but sometimes you wish for it.
Is it not so?
Yes.
I hope so.
It just happens to a man who has seen what we have seen.
And then I come to this place with my ancestors.
I will remember, like these blossom, we are all dying.
To know life in every breath...... every couple of tea, every life we take. the way of the warrior
The life in every breath.
Hai.
The Emperor has granted the safe passage to Tokyo.
We leave tomorrow.
- Good.
- Good.
when I took this, you were my enemy.
Excuse me.
No, so sorry.
I am finishing.
I must go away.
You have been kind to me.
Algren- san.
Go!
Algren?
Algren, my God, you are alive.
Will you never cease to astonish?
Howitzer
Yes, indeed.
Soon the Emperor signs the damn trade agreement.
He gets the whole package... including this particular item.
200 rounds a minute. and the new cartridge just cut down on jamming.
I need a bath.
After living with those savages, I can only imagine.
Welcome back, Captain.
You rise against me, my teacher.
No, Highness.
I rise against your enemies.
They are my advisors, like you.
They advise in their own interest.
I need advisors who know the modern world.
If I am no use, I will happily end my life.
No...
I need your voice in the council.
It is your voice we need, Highness.
You are a living God.
Do what you think is right.
I am a living God...... as long as I do what they think is right.
What sad words you speak...
Forgive me for saying what a teacher must.
Have you forgotten your people?
Tell me what to do...... my teacher.
You are Emperor, my Lord, not me.
You must find the wisdom for all of us.
Ah, gentlemen, come in.
Captain Algren, it seems you have endured your captivity with little ill effect.
I was not ill- treated, Sir.
Mr. Omura, I have here a draft of the arms agreement.
Captain Algren, I' m eager to know how many Samurai have joined in Katsumoto.
I' m afraid I don' t know.
You spent the entire winter in his encampment.
I was a prisoner.
Was it far to find his position? has he acquired firearms?
Come man, tell us what you saw.
As you said, Colonel, they are savages... with bows and arrows.
- Sir, about...
- I' m sure your documents are in order, ambassador, thank you.
If you leave them on my desk, I' il have a read at my appropriate time.
With all due respect, Sir. our president' s patience is wearing thin.
Perhaps there' s someone else we should be speaking to.
With all due respect, ambassador.
Perhaps there' s someone else we should be speaking to.
For instance, French or the English, or with any of the legations waiting in the next room.
Yes. well, we should be looking forward to hearing from you.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Captain Algren.
Perhaps you and I might have a while in private.
Please, sit down.
May I offer you a whiskey?
No, thank you.
Katsumoto is an extraordinary man, is he not?
He is a tribal leader.
I' ve known many of them.
But now who are Samurai, their way is a great appeal.
I don' t see others concerns me.
Ah, but it does.
Captain Algren.
Last year we were not prepared to go to battle.
You were right and Colonel Bagley was wrong.
But now we are ready.
If Katsumoto is allowed to attract the other Samurai to his cause, we will have 10 years of barbarian.
This is something I will not allow.
Either I' il stop him in the council today. or you will lead my army against him. and with these new weapons, you will crash him.
I appreciate the offer.
It is not an offer.
Mr. Omura, my contract with you, was to train your army.
Then we will make a new contract.
One that recognizes the extraordinary contribution you have made to the Emperor.
Do we understand each other?
Yes, we understand each other perfectly.
Then I am pleased.
Follow him.
If he goes anywhere near Katsumoto, kill him.
Captain Algren, what in heaven is this going on?
The diplomatic news are fast.
Omura has passed the laws against Samurais.
Mr. Graham, I need a drink.
He is your friend, Katsumoto, we can come to go up against the council this afternoon.
You, Samurai!
Don' t you know about the order?
Oh my God, it starts.
Hey boy, are you listening?
Kneel!
Lower your weapons!
Lower your weapons!
Lower your weapons!
Who are you?
I am Captain Algren.
Stop!
Get down!
I' il take you home.
Okay
We must resist the western powers...... by becoming powerful ourselves.
Our army, our economy must be strong.
Minister, you honor us.
It is my honor to rejoin this council.
Perhaps you are unaware of the law against wearing sword.
I read every law carefully.
Yet you bring weapons into this chamber?
This chamber was protected by my sword when...
We need no protection.
We are a nation of laws.
We are a nation of whores, selling ourselves...
If we are whores, the Samurai made us this way.
I have not seen the Omura family giving gold to the masses.
Minister Katsumoto, it is with great regreat... but I must ask you to remove your sword.
This sword serves the Emperor... only he can command me to remove it.
The Emperor' s voice is too pure to be heard in this council.
Then, I must refuse to give up my sword.
Then regretfully, my guards will accompany you to your home in Tokyo.
There you will await our summons.
I heard you are leaving
Omura offers my job and you run away.
I suppose I should thank you. $500 a month, including back pay for time spent... in captivity.
That is enough to come back inside the barrel for the rest of your life.
You are welcome.
Well, and this is putting in my drawer.
Katsumoto is under arrest, Omura won' t let him last the night.
With Katsumoto dead, we should get little trouble handling the rest of the rebellion.
Even without you.
Specially without you.
Just tell me one thing
What is it about your own people that you hate so much?
Save us the trouble...
The Samurai are finished!
Stop!
Don' t come any closer!
Whatever you do, don' t stop.
Minister Omura has commanded us to photograph the traitor.
Stop!
Somebody!
Bring that equipment here NOW!
Immediately!
You stop!
You insolent, useless son of a peasant dog!
How dare you show your sword in his presence!
Do you know who this is?
This is the President of the United States of America.
He is here to lead our armies in victorious battle against the rebels!
It' s not my responsibility...
Now get over there and help those men with their equipment!
Carry the equipment.
President of the United States?
Sorry, I think I made you sick.
How is your poem coming?
The end is proving difficult.
This is Mr. Simon Graham.
He would like very much to take you a photograph.
This is an honor.
I decided to stay.
See if I could convince you to escape.
How do you think to do that?
Mr. Graham, perhaps you would care to take pictures of my village.
I will be greatly honored.
My Lord!
My Lord, no!
Nobutada!
Father, let me stay.
It is my time.
My lord...... we must go.
The Emperor could not hear my words.
His army will come here.
It is the end.
For 900 years, my ancestors have protected our people.
Now...
I have failed them.
... in shame.
Shame for a life for "Service, Discipline, Compassion"
The way of the Samurai is not necessary any more.
Necessary?
What can be more necessary?
I' d rather die by the sword.
my own or my enemies'
Then let it be your enemies'.
Together, we will make the Emperor hear you.
He was a good man.
Will you fight the white men, too?
If they come here, yes.
Why?
Because they come to destroy what I have come to love.
The way of Samurai is difficult for children, he misses his father.
And he is angry because I am the cause of that.
No.
He is angry because he fears you will die as well.
My father taught me it is glorious to die in battle.
That is what he believed.
I would be afraid to die in battle.
So would I
But you have been in many battles.
And I was always afraid.
Algren
They are coming.
I take 2- 4 regiments.
Come in the waves of a thousand.
- They may have a howitzer.
- It makes no difference.
They will come in the way where we make up a stand.
How many men we have?
Maybe 500.
Like the general Custer, huh?
There was once a battle at a place called Thermopylae.
300 brave Greeks held off Persian army of a million men. a million, you understand this number?
I understand this number.
For two days, the Greeks made them pay so dearly...... the Persian army lost their strong taste for battle.
And they were defeated soon after.
What do you have in mind?
Take away the advantage of their guns.
I' m confident we can use that.
Move them close, close enough for a sword.
You believe a man can change his destiny?
I think a man does what he can... until his destiny is revealed.
May 25th, 1877.
This will be the last entry in this journal.
I try to give a true account of what I' ve seen, what I' ve done.
I do not presume to understand the course of my life.
But I know I' m grateful to a part taken in all of this.
Even if for a moment.
Algren- san, will you come with me?
If you wear this armor, it will honor us.
You will need this.
What does it say?
I belong to the warrior in whom the older ways have joined the new.
Good God!
Sir, The Imperial Army of Japan demands your surrender.
If you and your fellows lay down your arms, you will not be harmed.
This is not possible, as Mr. Omura knows
Captain Algren... we will show you no quarter.
You will be the same as they are.
I will look for you on the field.
- Captain Algren - Yes, Mr. Graham
Perhaps you could use this for your book.
Yes, I will.
Captain...
- Godspeed.
- Mr. Graham.
Stand up straight!
Are we ready?
Get into your position!
Fire for test!
Test!
Adjust the battery
Ready!
They are covering their retreat.
It seems they are attacked.
Nonsense!
Full attack!
Step forward!
Second volley.
What is happening?
Shoot!
Their attack has been stopped.
What happened to the warriors in Thermopylae?
Dead to the last man.
They' re once again winning.
There' il be two more regiments up here this time.
we won' t be able to stop them again.
You don' t have to die here.
I should' ve died so many times as before.
Now you live again.
Yes.
It is not your time.
It' s not over.
Cannon, prepare to fire!
Prepare to fire!
This is madness.
Is he going to attack?
Yes.
He is defeated.
He must accept his shame.
Kill them back.
Block them.
Now!
My horse!
Fire!
Attempt
Attempt
Fire!
Fire at will!
Bring up the new guns!
Fire!
Quickly!
Fire!
Stop firing!
Idiots, keep on firing!
Stop!
No...
Kill Katsumoto!
Kill the American!
You have your honor again.
Let me die with mine.
Help me up.
Are you ready?
I will miss our conversations.
perfect...
They are all perfect.
On behalf of the United States of America, the signing of this treaty... will usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity... and cooperation between our two great nations.
On behalf of the Emperor... we are pleased to have successfully concluded this...
... negotiation.
He is here?
Highness, if we could just conclude the matter at hand...
This is Katsumoto' s sword.
He would have wanted you to have it...... that the strength of the Samurai be with you always.
Enlightened One, we all weep for Katsumoto, but...
He hoped, with his last breath...... that you would remember the ancestors who held this sword...... and what they died for.
Your Highness.
You were with him at the end?
Hai.
(Yes)
Emperor, this man fought against you.
Your Highness, if you believe me to be your enemy.
Command me... and I will gladly take my life.
I have dreamed of a unified Japan.... of a country strong and independent and modern... and now, we have railroads, and cannons, western clothing.
But...
we cannot forget who we are...... or where we come from.
Ambassador Swanbeck...
I have concluded that this treaty is not in the best interests of my people.
Sir, if I may...
So sorry, but you may not.
This is an outrage!
Enlighted One, we should discuss this...
Omura...... you have done quite enough.
Everything I have done, I have done for my country.
Then you will not mind when I seize your family' s assets...... and present them as my gift to the people.
You disgrace me.
If your shame is too unbearable...
I offer you this sword.
Tell me how he died.
I will tell you how he lived.
And so the days of the Samurai had ended.
Nations, like men, it' s sometimes said, have their own destiny.
As for the American Captain, no one knows what became of him.
Some say he died of his wounds.
Others...... he returned to his own country.
But I like to think, he may have at last found some small measure of peace...... that we all seek, and few of us ever find.
Well, I' m sure I don' t know what you mean.
Well, you' re certain the treasure is real, despite what anyone else thinks.
No, but I hope it' s real.
I mean, I' ve dreamt it' s real since my grandfather told me about it.
But I want to hold it.
I feel like I' m so close, I can taste it.
I just want to know it' s not just something in my head or in my heart.
People don' t really talk that way, you know.
I know.
But they think that way.
"The vision to see the treasured past comes as the timely shadow crosses in front of the house of Pass and Stow."
Now, "Pass and Stow", of course, referring to...
- Why do you have to do that?
Well, John Pass and John Stow cast the bell.
Well, then, what does the rest of this mean?
Wait... "The vision to see the treasured past" must refer to a way to read the map.
Well, I thought the cipher was the map.
No, the cipher was a way to find the way to read the map.
And the way to read the map can be found where the "timely shadow" crosses in front of the Liberty Bell.
Right, so "timely shadow" - it' s a specific time.
- What time?
Wait a minute, wait.
You' re gonna love this.
Excuse me, can I see one of those hundred- dollar bills I paid you with?
Oh.
Well, here, I have this diver' s watch.
It' s actually quite valuable.
- You can use it as collateral.
- Whatever.
Thank you.
On the back of a hundred- dollar bill is an etching of Independence Hall
Thank you.... in the 1780s, who...
The artist was actually a friend of Benjamin Franklin' s.
- Hold this.
OK.
I' m not going anywhere.
Now, I think that if we look at this clock tower...... we may find the specific time.
- What time is it now?
- Almost three.
- We missed it.
We didn' t miss it because...
You don' t know this?
I- I know something about history that you don' t know.
I' d be very excited to learn about it, Riley.
let me just take in this moment.
This is... this is cool.
Because, you know...
- Riley!
- All right.
What I know is that daylight savings wasn' t established until World War I.
- Riley, you' re a genius.
Yeah.
Do you actually know who the first person to suggest daylight savings was?
- Benjamin Franklin.
Is this real?
Just tell me what you told my friend.
Just a bunch of letters.
I can' t remember.
Can you remember which ones you were gonna tell him next?
S- T- O- W.
Liberty Bell and Independence Hall.
Imagine its impact back in the 18th century.
It could have been seen for miles around, which was exactly its purpose, because it served as a beacon, as it were, for people to collect and hear...
It gained a place in history on July 8, 1776, when the Liberty Bell tolled for the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence.
- Who?
- What?
It' s not here.
It' s there.
Come on.
It replaced the Liberty Bell in 1876.
I' m gonna go down there, and you meet me in the signing room.
- OK.
All right, let' s go.
3: 22.
My idea.
I found this.
Some kind of ocular device.
"The vision to see the treasured past."
Let me take this.
Aw, they' re like early American X - Ray specs.
Benjamin Franklin invented something like these.
So, what do we do with them?
We look through it.
- Careful.
- You think?
- It' s just that the last time this was here it was being signed.
- Careful.
- Spectacles.
What is it?
Is it a treasure map?
It says, "Heere at the wall", spelled with two E' s.
Take a look.
Oh, no.
- Oh, no.
Well, lan has nearly unlimited resources.
And he' s smart.
I don' t think we can get out of here without being spotted.
Well, we don' t want them to have the Declaration, or the glasses.
But we especially don' t want them to have them both together.
- So what do we do?
- We separate the lock from the key.
- Good idea.
Really?
I' il take this.
You keep that.
Meet me at the car and call me if you have any problems.
Like if we get caught and killed?
That would be a big problem.
- I will.
- I will.
We' re on him.
There he is.
- Shaw, look.
There' s the others.
- I got it.
Viktor, meet me at Fifth and Chestnut.
They' re heading your way.
- Riley!
- There they are!
- Move!
- Time to run.
Move.
Come on.
In here.
- Follow me.
That way.
If you' re not a steak, you don' t belong here.
- Who, baldy?
- Yes.
Honey, stay as long as you like.
Oh, thank you.
You want something?
- Shut up.
I see why you left him.
Go around.
Gates!
Aw, come on!
- Hiding.
Come on.
Let' s go, let' s go.
They' re heading toward City Hall.
- OK, I' m on my way.
- Out of the way!
I' il be right there.
Hey, Gates!
Give me the document.
All right, Phil.
Get out of my way!
Watch it!
Let 'em go.
- FBl.
Have you seen this guy?
Ted.
Philadelphia police found Gates' s car.
We got surveillance there now.
Let' s go.
Tell the boss we got the car.
- We lost it.
- What?
- We lost the Declaration.
Lan took it.
You all right?
You both all right?
Yeah, yeah, we' re all right.
- Ben, I' m sorry.
- We' il be fine.
Meet me at the car.
Suspect has arrived.
Hello, Mr Gates.
Mr Gates, face your father' s car and put your hands behind your back, please.
- We got one in custody.
- Gates, you' re a hard man to find.
Could you please be careful?
Riley, do you know how to get in touch with lan?
Excuse me?
That' s some story.
- By you.
- No, by lan.
I stole it to stop him.
I did it alone.
Dr Chase was not involved.
And lan still ended up with the Declaration of Independence.
Because of you.
So here' s your options.
Door number one, you go to prison for a very long time.
Door number two, we are going to get back the Declaration of Independence, you help us find it, and you still go to prison for a very long time, but you feel better inside.
Is there a door that doesn' t lead to prison?
- Yeah.
So what are these for?
It' s a way to read the map.
Right.
Knights Templar.
Freemasons.
Invisible treasure map.
- So what' d it say?
- "Heere at the wall."
Nothing else.
It' s just another clue.
It looks like lan Howe could be a false identity.
Follow up with ATF and INS.
There' s more to it.
- Standard tap procedure.
- Let' s check the signal, folks.
- Lock it in.
- Are we set?
- Checking source.
- Unknown number.
Yes.
Hello, Ben.
How are you?
- Um, chained to a desk.
- Sorry to hear that.
I want you to meet me on the flight deck of the USS Intrepid.
- You know where that is?
- New York.
Meet me there at ten o' clock tomorrow morning.
And bring those glasses you found at Independence Hall.
Yeah, I know about the glasses.
We can take a look at the Declaration, and then you can be on your way.
And I' m supposed to believe that.
I told you from the start, I only wanted to borrow it.
You can have it.
And the glasses.
I' il even throw in the pipe from the Charlotte.
I' il be there.
And tell the FBI agents listening in on this call if they want the Declaration back, and not just a box of confetti, then you' il come alone.
- Take positions.
- Perimeter looks normal.
- Can I get a status report?
- Crow' s nest in position.
Port side is quiet.
Copy that.
- Gates is on the flight deck.
- Eyes on Gates.
- Do not lose sight of primary mark.
- Brian, you' re clear with NYPD.
- I have a visual.
- Gates.
Stay with the program.
I hope your agents are all under four feet tall and wearing little scarves.
Otherwise lan' s gonna know they' re here.
As soon as he shows you the Declaration, we' il move in.
Don' t try anything.
Just let us handle it.
You know, Agent Sadusky, something I' ve noticed about fishing:
It never works out so well for the bait.
Sir, we' ve got some traffic incoming.
Looks like a sightseeing helicopter.
Unit two, get an eyeball on that chopper.
Agent Michaels, get FAA flight plans and authorization records on that craft.
If that' s not Mr Howe, I want to know who it is.
He' s coming from the north.
- Gates.
Are you with me?
Well, I' m sure not against you, if that' s what you' re asking.
We' ve got some interference on Gates' s mike, sir.
This I know.
Hello, Ben.
Thomas Edison needed only one way to make a light bulb.
Sound familiar?
- Keep sightlines clear.
- What' s the devil' s going on?
There' s a lot of commotion.
Go to the starboard observation point behind the F- 16 and here' s what you do.
Gates?
Air Tour helicopter, you are in controlled airspace.
Vacate immediately.
Who' s got Gates?
- All agents, report in.
- I can' t see anything.
- Did Gates speak to anybody?
- Target is moving.
- He' s heading towards the stern.
- I' ve got him.
He' s coming this way.
Anyone got a view of our friend lan Howe?
Lan Howe is not at the stern, sir.
Then why is he heading there?
He' s at the observation deck.
Sadusky.
I' m still not against you.
But I found door number three.
And I' m taking it.
- What' s he talking about?
- Move in!
Move in on Gates!
Divers are a go.
- Snipers, go to action zebra.
Pursue at own risk.
- I repeat, pursue at own risk.
- You first.
Holy mackerel.
He set us up.
Agent Dawes, do you have a visual?
Can you see Gates in the water?
Sir, it' s the Hudson.
Nothing is visible.
Smart fish.
Hello, Ben.
Welcome to New Jersey.
- What' d you do with Abigail and Riley?
We had to guess your sizes.
I said, what' d you do with Abigail and Riley?
He' s the only one who could' ve told you that line about Edison.
Did you bring the glasses?
Tell me what' s happening here.
Ask your girlfriend.
She' s the one calling all the shots now.
Yeah, hello.
- Hi, sweetie.
How' s your day going?
Uh, interesting, dear.
So, what, you working with lan now?
It turns out helping someone escape from FBI custody is a criminal act.
- Well, you' re...
You' re... you' re... you' re all right, yeah?
I mean you' re safe?
Yeah, we both are.
Riley' s right here, doing something clever with a computer.
I' m tracking you through the GPS in Shaw' s phone.
They take a turn anywhere we don' t want, we' il know it.
So don' t worry.
If lan tries to double- cross us, we can call the FBI and tell them right where you are.
- And where is that?
Right across the street from where we' re hiding, at the intersection of Wall Street and Broadway.
"Heere at the wall."
Wall Street and Broadway.
Ben, there is a catch.
It was the only way we could get this far.
He' s here.
A jump like that could kill a man.
Naw, it was cool.
You should try it sometime.
The Declaration of Independence.
All yours.
- That' s it?
- That' s it.
I knew you' d keep your promise.
Where' s my treasure?
It' s right here.
The map said "Heere at the wall", spelled with two E' s.
Wall Street follows the path of an actual wall that the original Dutch settlers built as a defence to keep the British out.
The main gate was located at a street called De Heere, also two E' s.
So, "Heere at the wall."
Broadway, Wall Street.
Just a moment, Ben.
Lan, if you break our deal, the FBI will be only a few minutes behind you.
You might get away, you might not.
Is that all the map said?
Every word.
Oh, Ben.
You know the key to running a convincing bluff?
Every once in a while you' ve got to be holding all the cards.
Is there anything else you want to tell me?
Trinity Church.
Good.
Well, why don' t you ask Dr Chase and Riley to join us?
I' m sure they' re around here somewhere.
Sit.
Sit down.
No, now.
Or you can figure out the clues for yourself.
Good luck.
Ben.
I don' t think you fully appreciate the gravity of the situation.
It' s... it' s really quite something.
Take a look.
- "Beneath Parkington Lane."
But why would the map lead us here, then take us somewhere else?
Dad.
No, you' re right.
Parkington Lane has to be here somewhere.
A street inside the church?
Beneath the church.
Cooperation only lasts as long as the status quo is unchanged.
As soon as this guy gets to wherever this thing ends, he won' t need you any more.
So we find a way to make sure the status quo changes in our favour.
- I' m still working on it.
Well, I guess I better work on it too, then.
Hey, I found it!
It' s a name.
Parkington Lane.
He was a third- degree master mason of the Blue Lo...
Stop!
All right, put it down.
Right.
McGregor, Viktor, you stay here.
And if anyone should come out without me, well... use your imagination.
Shall we?
Watch your step.
A dumbwaiter system.
How do a bunch of guys with hand tools build all this?
Same way they built the pyramids and the Great Wall of China.
The aliens helped them.
Right, let' s go.
What are we waiting for?
I' m not going out on that thing.
200 years of termite damage and rot.
Dad, do what he says.
We' re right under the Trinity graveyard.
That' s probably why no one ever found this.
OK, get on the elevator.
- Come on.
Get on!
Get down there!
I had to save the Declaration.
No, don' t be.
I would have done exactly the same thing to you.
Really?
I would have dropped you both.
Freaks.
Lan... it' s not worth it.
Do you imagine any one of your lives is more valuable to me than Shaw' s?
We go on.
The status quo.
Keep the status quo.
- This is...
This is where it all leads.
So where' s the treasure?
This is it?
We came all this way for a dead end?
Yes.
- Another clue, or...
- No, there are no more clues!
That' s it, OK?
It' s over!
End of the road.
The treasure' s gone.
Moved.
Taken somewhere else.
You' re not playing games with me, are you, Ben?
No.
Hey, wait a minute.
- Wait, wait, wait!
- We' il be trapped.
- You can' t just leave us here.
Yes, I can.
Unless Ben tells me the next clue.
There isn' t another clue.
Lan, why don' t you come back down here and we can talk through this together?
The clue.
Where' s the treasure?
Ben?
The status quo has changed, son.
Don' t.
In King Solomon' s temple there was a winding staircase.
It signified the journey that had to be made to find the light of truth.
- And what does it mean?
It' s Boston.
The Old North Church in Boston, where Thomas Newton hung a lantern in the steeple, to signal Paul Revere that the British were coming.
Under the winding staircase of the steeple, that' s where we have to look.
- Hey, you have to take us with you.
So you can escape in Boston?
Besides, with you out of the picture there' s less baggage to carry.
What if we lied?
Did you?
What if there' s another clue?
Then I' il know right where to find you.
See you, Ben.
- Come back!
- You' re gonna need us, lan!
We' re all gonna die.
It' s gonna be OK, Riley.
I' m sorry I yelled at you.
It' s OK, kiddo.
OK, boys, what' s going on?
The British came by sea.
It was two lanterns, not one.
Lan needed another clue, so we gave it to him.
It was a fake.
The all- seeing eye.
"Through the all- seeing eye."
That means... by the time lan figures it out and comes back here, we' il still be trapped, and he' il shoot us then.
Nobody' s gonna die.
There' s another way out.
Where?
Through the treasure room.
Here.
Riley.
Looks like someone got here first.
It' s gone.
- It may have even been gone before Charles Carroll told the story to Thomas Gates.
I know.
Cos you were right.
No, I wasn' t right.
This room is real, Ben.
And that means the treasure is real.
We' re in the company of some of the most brilliant minds in history, because you found what they left behind for us to find and understood the meaning of it.
For all of us.
Your grandfather, and all of us.
And I' ve never been so happy to be proven wrong.
I just... really thought I was gonna find the treasure.
OK.
Then we just keep looking for it.
I' m in.
OK.
Not to be Johnny Rain Cloud here, but that' s not gonna happen.
Yeah.
Well, that' s it.
- Right.... and in case of cave- ins.
Could it really be that simple?
"The secret lies with Charlotte."
Scrolls from the library at Alexandria.
Could this be possible?
It' s a big... bluish- green man, with a strange- looking goatee.
I' m guessing that' s significant.
Riley, are you crying?
Look.
Stairs.
Hi.
Do you have a cell phone I could borrow?
- Just like that?
- Just like that.
You do know you just handed me your biggest bargaining chip?
The Declaration of Independence is not a bargaining chip.
Not to me.
Have a seat.
So what' s your offer?
How about a bribe?
Say... ten billion dollars?
I take it you found the treasure?
It' s about five stories beneath your shoes.
You know, the Templars and the Freemasons believed that the treasure was too great for any one man to have, not even a king.
That' s why they went to such lengths to keep it hidden.
That' s right.
The Founding Fathers believed the same thing about government.
I figure their solution will work for the treasure too.
Give it to the people.
Divide it amongst the Smithsonian, the Louvre, the Cairo museum...
There' s thousands of years of world history down there.
And it belongs to the world, and everybody in it.
You really don' t understand the concept of a bargaining chip.
OK, here' s what I want.
Dr Chase gets off completely clean, not even a little Post- it on her service record.
OK.
I want the credit for the find to go to the entire Gates family, with the assistance of Mr Riley Poole.
And what about you?
I' d really love not to go to prison.
I can' t even begin to describe how much I would love not to go to prison.
Someone' s got to go to prison, Ben.
Well, if you' ve got a helicopter, I think I can help with that.
Freeze!
FBl!
Don' t move!
- Show me your hands!
- Put your hands up.
- Move, move, move.
You' re under arrest, Mr Howe.
We' ve got you on kidnapping, attempted murder... and trespassing on government property.
Yeah.
You got it, chief.
Thank you.
Bye.
They want us in Cairo next week for the opening of the exhibit.
They' re sending a private jet.
That' s fun.
Yeah, big whoop.
We could have had a whole fleet of private jets.
They offered you ten per cent and you turned it down.
Riley, we' ve been over this.
It was too much.
I couldn' t accept it.
I still have this splinter that' s been festering for three months from an old piece of wood.
OK, I' il tell you what.
Next time we find a treasure that redefines history for all mankind, you make the call on the finder' s fee.
That' s not as funny.
What do you care?
You got the girl.
- It' s true.
Rub it in.
Enjoy your spoils... while I sit on one per cent.
One stinkin 'per cent.
Half of one per cent, actually.
One per cent.
Unbelievable.
I' m sorry for your suffering, Riley.
For the record, Ben, I like the house.
You know, I chose this estate because in 1812 Charles Carroll met...
Yeah, someone that did something in history and had fun.
Great.
Wonderful.
Could have had a bigger house.
- You did?
What?
- A map?
Where does it lead to?
You' il figure it out.
"Information"... the very nature of the word is beginning to change.
The world is shrinking.
Borders are collapsing... cultures are growing closer and closer day by day.
Information is the new unexplored frontier.
And in the forefront of this new age is, of course... the Internet.
Are you sure this is a big story?
"Scoop," Joaquim.
The proper term is scoop.
And, yeah, I' m sure.
Cute secretaries don' t lie.
Well...
Hank, you' re my hero.
- Hey, where are you going?
Do you have an appointment?
There' s a coup going on in that boardroom.
You need an appointment to get in.
7tv, Hank Robinson, right there.
Okay, rock and roll.
- Public broadcasting?
- Is that a problem?
Take it easy, Hank.
I' m not going to take it easy.
I don' t need this guy keeping me out of here... because he doesn' t like the company I' m working for.
How come he waltzes through?
Señor Aribau has the exclusive rights to all Nova communications.
The number of people who get their news from the Internet... as opposed to, you know, TV or newspapers... grows by 1 million worldwide each year.
One million.
Just follow my lead, and it' il be fine, okay?
Good morning, Christina, you look beautiful.
Just a minute, please.
The conclusion is obvious.
He who controls the Internet... controls information.
In the last three years, Nova communications... have carved a widening niche in the telecommunications market.
Well, I believe it' s time we expanded.
Did you call the press, Señor Pla?
No, I did not.
If you think something newsworthy is going to happen today... you are very much mistaken.
You may be our main stockholder, but I' m still president of this company.
I direct policy.
Nothing will change that.
Hank Robinson reporting from Barcelona.
I am standing in front of the headquarters of Nova... the fastest growing telecommunications company in Spain.
Today, majority shareholder Manuel Pla is challenging Nova president Sert... inside the boardroom, while I stand out here in the parking lot.
Come on, let' s go again.
Take two.
What' s this?
This is my offer, Señor Sert.
Quite generous, I think.
You' re trying to buy me out?
We get a two- shot and we go to lunch, okay?
On the floor.
- Don' t move!
- Oh, no!
What the hell is that?
What the hell is going on here?
- What' s the meaning of this?
- Oh, my God!
Jesus Christ!
Let' s go.
- In there, where the story is.
Someone with a gun.
- Give me the camera.
- No!
Nothing is worth dying for, man.
- Call the police, I' m going in.
- Hank.
- Who are you people?
- We are Anarchy Now.
Your company spreads lies to confuse innocent people.
Gunfire at the Nova offices.
Always make sure there' s film in the camera.
You support the capitalist pigs.
This is your reward.
All of you, get out of here!
Come on, run!
Run!
Tell everyone the truth.
Listen, call Veronica.
Tell her I' ve got footage of Sert' s murder.
Acts of terror have become so commonplace in our age... that we run the risk of becoming used to their images... to becoming desensitised to them.
The day that these shocking, horrific images fail to appal us... is the day that we begin to lose some of our humanity.
Let' s let these images speak for themselves.
I, for one, will not soon forget them.
- My favourite part' s coming up.
- This is Hank Robinson reporting... with a 7tv news exclusive.
And we' re out.
Pure genius.
It helps to have the hottest producer in town.
They want to licence your video.
- Bleed them dry.
- And our ratings are climbing.
We got 20 share tonight.
Thousands of people tuned in.
- How does it feel being a star?
- Twenty share?
Speaking as your producer, I' m thrilled.
Speaking as your girlfriend... don' t ever risk your life like that again.
With great risks come great rewards.
What you did was the most inspiring thing I' ve ever seen.
Veronica.
That tape...
The thing is...
- I just -- - Proved to the world... what I' ve always known.
You' re the real deal, Hank.
And I don' t want to lose you.
I love you, too.
I have to rinse.
Yes, I understand all that, but just get him for me.
At 3: 00, you' re interviewing Cardinal Rosselli.
- I thought he never meets the press.
- He agreed to talk to you.
This is a real scoop.
I' m getting audio interference on Camera 2.
- Interference?
- Either God' s talking to us... or it' s someone' s cell phone.
His polls are rather low.
Can' t you see the sign?
I' m most terribly sorry.
Very thoughtless of me.
Nicola, I' il have to call you back.
I' m Archibald McGovern.
And you are Veronica Nadal.
Top of your class of the Barcelona School of Journalism.
'98, actually.
I' m here to see Mr. Robinson.
So, this is 7tv.
Well, it' s quaint.
Is your studio fully soundproof?
Of course.
Some of the equipment has been here since the '60s.
That' s all, it needs to be replaced.
A journalist of Mr. Robinson' s stature deserves better.
We are only a local station, we take what we can get.
- Jordi, what the hell are you doing?
You can start by replacing him.
Excuse me.
Hank Robinson?
And CEO of Vision Television News.
Pleasure to meet you.
I' m sorry, this will have to wait.
Have you met Veronica, my producer?
Oh, yes, indeed.
And I will only take five.
You have to forgive her.
She' s a little protective.
And rightly so.
You' re her gold mine.
So that' s McGovern.
Seems like a nice guy.
Yeah, that' s just what they said about Hitler.
Let' s get Hank' s sound levels up.
- WeIl, we did start 7tv together.
- It' s kind of our baby.
Scrimping and scavenging for every cent... hunting down stories, hoping and praying for the exclusive... that would put you on the map.
I know it very well.
So tell me, Hank, how many viewers does 7tv get a week?
70, 000?
100, 000?
55, 000, sir.
Vision TV... is watched by 10 million people every night, and growing.
What can I do for you?
Mr. Robinson, I' m here on a rather serious matter.
Did you know that he worked for me?
Yes, he was a wonderful reporter.
On the morning of the Nova attack, I sent Carlos to interview Señor Sert... and then, your story came to my attention.
Mr. Robinson, you represent...
Well, Hank, you represent everything... that Vision TV has come to stand for.
And I would like you to join our family.
I beg your pardon?
That' s right, Hank, your gravy train has come in.
I' m going to have to talk to someone about that.
I' m sure she will realise what a grand opportunity this is for you.
- Bring her along if you like.
Of course he wants to hire you.
Guys like McGovern are afraid of guys like you.
McGovern, he reports the official story.
- He gets us into 10 million households.
- Yeah, but at what price?
My father worked for 10 years before the networks called... and when they did, he jumped at it.
Hank, we are so close to achieving everything we wanted.
- Don' t throw away our independence.
- This is a good thing.
- You made a decision like that without me?
- I' m your partner, I' m your girlfriend.
- They promised to hire you.
I already have everything I' ve ever wanted.
At least, I thought I did.
Veronica, please sit down.
Women.
- Let me buy you a drink.
- No, I got to go.
I think you' re doing the right thing.
Vision TV, man.
That' s a big time.
- Need a cameraman?
You know what?
I' il ask them, all right?
You do that.
- Hank.
- Yeah?
It wasn' t loaded.
Sure it was.
No, it wasn' t.
I number all my tapes.
It was empty.
What' s your point?
None of my business how you got the story.
Just share the wealth, you know?
I' m a talented guy, and I' m shooting porn to make ends meet.
It' s a fucking crime.
Are you blackmailing me?
No, I would never do that.
We' re friends, right?
- Friends do friends favours.
- Sure they do.
- So, good karma.
- We understand each other.
- We understand each other.
- Terrific.
I' il be seeing you, Hank.
Hey, hombre, that' s my beer.
Hey, Hank!
Here' s to us.
Partners forever!
Birth of a Nation:
The Founding of Iran by Howard Robinson.
Your father' s book was required reading in class.
Barcelona School of Journalism.
I' m your assistant.
This is my first job.
Hello, Marisa.
It' s my first time having an assistant.
Miss Markham is waiting for you in the newsroom.
- Of course, Nicola Markham.
- Yeah, she' s our news director.
All right, the Chinese plan to have a man on the moon by the end of the year.
Right, if their entire population stands on each other' s shoulders.
- You' re late.
- Sorry, I didn' t realise there was a meeting.
News happens every day, Robinson, and every day we report it.
That' s why we are called a news service.
Eduardo, the Chinese astronaut is yours, a present from me.
And next, in Africa, AlDS epidemic is at an all- time high.
Katrina, you run with that.
And in local news, Barcelona is once again in the Champion' s League.
Make it the lead story.
Okay, what are you waiting for?
- Not so fast, Robinson.
- Call me Hank.
Robinson, how the hell did you end up in Spain?
I thought there were more career opportunities in Europe.
Meaning you couldn' t cut it stateside.
If you want to last here, you will follow instructions, claro?
- Claro.
Manuel Pla set his sights on his main rival, Intertel.
If Pla succeeds in purchasing Intertel... he will have a virtual monopoly on the telecommunications market.
- First Spain, then Europe.
- Precisely.
Find out why he won' t sell, and what he intends to do about it.
- Questions?
- No, ma' am.
Good.
I was in Tehran with your father during the revolution.
You look a lot like him.
I hope I' m half the reporter he was.
Careful what you wish for.
Señor Agustin, you' re dealing with a hostile takeover bid from Nova.
How are you planning to deal with the threat?
I have faith in the loyalty of my stockholders.
They realise Nova is trying to force everyone out of business.
That may be, but we deal in a free market society.
Can you really fault them their success?
Think of a world in which one company provided every service.
Without competition, there is no need to maintain quality, or accountability.
Information should belong to everyone.
Unregulated.
Thank you, sir.
This is Hank Robinson reporting from Intertel.
We have the edit suite booked for noon... so with any luck, we should be done tomorrow afternoon.
- I am, yes.
Your predecessor, Carlos Aribau, was a friend of mine.
- Was he?
- Did you know him?
Our paths crossed briefly.
Listen, I' d love to chat, but I must run.
- Of course.
Good luck.
I hope this business doesn' t victimise you the way it did Carlos.
What do you mean?
You know what it' s like... trying to weed out the liars from the honest men.
In the end, Carlos trusted no one.
Not even his best friends.
- Did I wake you?
Who' s this?
You' ve got 45 minutes.
Time for a piss and a shower.
I' m not going anywhere until you tell me your name.
Nova, Hank.
The Anarchist attack, remember?
You didn' t sit on your ass.
You went out there and got the story.
What do you want?
45 minutes.
And, hey, make sure there' s film in the camera this time, okay?
Nothing personal.
You' ve seen too much.
Señor Agustin... wants you dead.
- Of course.
He got uptight... claimed his private life was nobody' s business.
Sounds like he doesn' t know this girl is a killer.
He' s hiding it.
- Conjecture.
- It all fits.
Nova.
Who did the terrorists attack?
Who benefits?
Agustin.
- Talk about aggressive business practices.
- It' s still all conjecture.
We operate on facts.
I saw her at Nova' s office.
I saw her face.
Your word isn' t proof.
You need corroboration.
Nicola may be a bit overzealous at times, but she has a point.
- Looking forward to seeing it.
- You' il have to excuse me.
- Thank you for your time.
Mr. Robinson?
Manuel Pla.
I recognise you from TV.
- And the lovely...
Marisa is my assistant.
- Pleasure.
- Congratulations.
Your company' s fortunes have really turned around.
He made us famous.
And if we succeed on acquiring Intertel...
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Thank you.
Would you like a drink?
Sure.
Scotch is great, thanks.
Hi.
How are things?
Fine.
I mean, sure, we' re in a ratings slump right now... but we' il turn it around.
I' ve met a few young reporters with a lot of potential.
You look beautiful.
So, that' s your date?
- Marisa?
Yes, she' s my intern.
- Is that what they call it now?
I miss you.
A lot.
Can we get together?
I' ve left some of my things at your place.
Well, come on by.
Anytime.
I' ve got a story to cover.
Hey, I know you.
It must have been scary.
- What' s that?
- Alone, filming the Anarchists.
They weren' t just angry young kids with cap guns.
Top- of- the- line Uzis, classic commando assault.
I' d say they had training, financing, backing.
Someone developed Anarchists Now.
And that someone is running the show.
I' m sorry, I didn' t get your name.
I' m a cop.
Brechner, Interpol.
- On duty?
- Always, keeping an eye on things.
Don' t want a repeat of the Nova incident, do we?
Agent Brechner, you mind if I ask you a few questions?
- Always.
Why not?
You identified any of the anarchists?
We have our suspicions.
One of them is a woman.
- You know her name?
- Do you?
All right, I' il level with you:
My bosses won' t let me run it until I get corroboration.
- If I show you a picture, can you confirm it?
Anonymous source.
What do you need?
Her name is Leila Krtolica.
Anarchy Now' s aim is to create chaos... to destabilise governments, eventually create a new world order.
Businesses represent capitalism to them, their most hated enemy.
Already this year they' ve claimed 28 victims.
Leila made Interpol' s most- wanted in June.
- Now she' s in Spain.
- But what' s her connection to Agustin?
Terrorists need funding.
It' s hard to blow up bombs on an empty stomach.
You tell me Eloy Agustin is a sponsor of terrorism?
According to my Interpol source.
They' ve been watching him for years.
Looks like you' ve got your corroboration, Nicola.
Impress me.
What is the connection between Anarchy Now operative Leila Krtolica... and Eloy Agustin of Intertel?
Recently, Krtolica assassinated the President of Nova...
Agustin' s greatest rival.
Coincidence?
Señor Agustin has denied any connection with any terrorist group... and maintains he is the victim of a frame- up.
Cut.
- Not bad.
You don' t want to hurt yourself praising.
You did your job.
What do you want, a cookie?
We' il lead with it tonight.
Happy?
Jesus, Veronica, I thought you were looking for...
- So what are you doing here?
- I told you, I left some things behind.
You weren' t home.
I still have my key.
Which reminds me.
So long, Hank.
I' m sorry.
I' m just...
Sorry, I' m a little high- strung lately.
I saw your report tonight.
- You watch Vision TV?
- Only when you' re on.
- And?
- You did good.
I' m happy for you.
Thanks.
Careful, Hank.
I am humbled by the trust I' ve been given in being appointed Nova' s new CEO.
I vow to lead Nova and its new acquisitions... with integrity and vision, into a prosperous future.
In the furore following the allegations surrounding Eloy Agustin last week...
Intertel stockholders voted unanimously to sell their company to Manuel Pla.
Señor Agustin, meanwhile... is under investigation by the Chief Magistrate' s office.
This is Hank Robinson with Vision TV signing off.
Didn' t your father ever teach you to keep your powder dry?
Your story on Agustin caused quite a stir.
I' ve had the Chief Magistrate on the line all morning.
Yes.
Free publicity is priceless.
Actually, I was thinking more about the social value.
We exposed killers.
Ever wonder what a limey like me was doing in Spain?
I love it.
Still virgin territory, pure.
It' s waiting to be developed.
The rest of Europe is so cynical.
It' s too knowing.
And together we going to make this city the centre for world news.
And I have faith in you.
We' re onto something wonderful.
You can' t learn to be a journalist from a book.
Didn' t they teach you anything at school?
We had a saying.
That' s a good motto.
Hello?
Yes, he is.
Hold, please.
You' ve got a call on Line 1.
Thank you.
Hello.
Good morning, partner.
Caught your piece last night.
Good job.
You going to give me your name this time?
Call me Crusader.
Okay, Crusader... how did you know that Agustin was sponsoring terrorism?
A magician never explains his tricks.
Listen... why me?
You' re a rising star, Hank.
You could go far.
I look forward to working with you for a very long time.
Listen, how do I get a hold of you if I need you?
You were handed the story on a silver platter.
- What are you complaining about?
- I don' t trust him, or like him.
You' re beginning to sound like Carlos Aribau.
What?
Okay, I know what this is about: fear of success.
- Bullshit.
Just do your job!
Here, another early story by Carlos Aribau.
Anything interesting?
The usual.
Local news, some crimes, some human interests.
You' re a walking encyclopaedia, Marisa.
Listen... - how did Aribau make it big?
- I heard, out of nowhere, he got a lead.
Something really big.
Out of nowhere?
Aribau had a secret source.
He never revealed who it was.
Probably never knew.
After that big story that make him famous... he was offered a job at Vision TV, and the rest is history.
That first big job?
Industrial espionage.
Some telecommunications companies has been accused of violating antitrust laws.
Aribau would champion their cause and prove their innocence.
I was in high school, but I remember it was a big deal at the time.
Manuel Pla.
Manuel Pla would have been ruined, but Aribau saved him.
Over and over...
Pla benefited.
Señor Agustin?
Señor Agustin, we need to talk.
This is my home.
For 20 years!
I founded this company, and you...
- You took it away!
- We were set up.
The both of us.
Now, how did you meet the girl?
She came up to me, at the conference.
She was interested!
You are a man.
A woman that beautiful is interested in you, do you chase her away?
She said you wanted me dead.
And you believed it.
You, the great reporter!
I made a mistake.
I' ve been in business for a very long time.
This isn' t over yet.
Tell me what you know.
I asked my own questions, hired my own investigators.
She' s no terrorist.
She' s a cold, methodical killer.
- She' il kill for you if the price is right.
- Are you telling me she' s a mercenary?
The Americans have a term for people like her.
They call them "security contractors."
- Who hired her?
- Pla?
- Only a fool.
Others behind him.
- Tell me who, Señor Agustin.
God, it' s them.
You brought them here!
Señor Agustin.
No!
You did all you could, Mr. Robinson.
You are a hero.
A hero would have saved him.
Two assailants, one male, one female.
Anything you can remember about them?
The motorcycle mask.
I' m sorry.
One moment, please.
- Robinson.
- Don' t say another word.
Are you all right?
- Everything is fine.
- Yeah, everything is fine.
- It' s an important call.
- It' s an important call.
Take your time.
Listen, you son of a bitch, I am onto you.
You set up Agustin.
Don' t be so melodramatic.
Take a deep breath, calm down.
I am coming after you.
I don' t exist, Hank.
I' m a whisper, a breath on the other end of the line.
You set up Agustin and you set me up.
You want me dead next?
I do hope it doesn' t come to that.
I have many, many more stories to tell you.
I' m not Carlos Aribau.
No, you' re worse.
Carlos never stepped on corpses to get a story.
- McGovern.
- Hank!
- Have you been in an accident?
Agustin has been murdered.
He was strangled, and left hanging like a piece of meat.
- Murdered?
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
- The police are calling it suicide.
They found a note in his home, and there is an eyewitness.
What are you talking about?
I saw it, I was there.
All right, Hank, I believe you... but this is a news service.
You' il never get this past Nicola without proof.
Markham.
What time did it happen?
Take it easy.
It' s about Agustin --
Feeling the unyielding hand of the law closing in on him... and filled with remorse over his terrorist activity... he lynched himself.
McGovern scooped you.
But... how did he know?
Veronica?
Okay, come on, everybody, run!
Give me the fucking gun!
Veronica, hi, it' s me.
Listen, can you meet me at the station?
So, Hank, how are they treating you at Vision TV?
Good?
- Can' t complain.
- Do you get overtime?
- Pedro.
- Did they give you an assistant?
- Yeah.
- Is she a babe?
Pedro, the tape.
Well, the tracking' s screwed up.
- Was the camera damaged in any way?
- Well...
We could dump both picture and sound on a computer... and run a component program.
I' ve got just the thing for that.
The computer would digitally adjust the tracking.
It could clean up over 90% of your sound and image.
- How long is that going to take?
Do it.
Now, about your assistant?
Okay, Pedro.
Thank you very much.
She' s a slave master.
You' re lucky you escaped when you did.
Let me see if I understand.
The Anarchy Now attack... it was all a ploy to disguise Sert' s murder.
They killed the president of Nova so that Manuel Pla could take over... and they framed Agustin so Pla could control Intertel, right?
You were a witness.
- Why didn' t you expose them?
- I didn' t know what I had.
The first time I looked at the tape, it looked like a bunch of static.
What do you mean, "the first time"?
You shot this, didn' t you?
Whose tape is this?
Carlos Aribau' s.
Veronica, come on!
You robbed a dead man.
Have you no shame?
The cops.
They examined the tape.
- Why didn' t they catch this?
- Okay?
I kept the original.
- They are going to crucify you.
Why did you do it?
- Because...
I was living in my father' s shadow.
All my life, I wanted to...
I just...
I just wanted to be the best, I just wanted to please.
I saw it.
It was in my hand, I just took it.
I just did it.
I just took it.
I' m not this guy.
I' m not.
Marisa.
Good luck.
Mr. McGovern?
I bet you think you' re quite the hotshot.
Is there a problem, sir?
You, Robinson, and your story.
Your story on Agustin put us at the top of the ratings.
Congratulations.
I know someone who' s going to be very happy with his Christmas bonus this year.
- Wow.
Thank you.
- Don' t mention it.
You know, maybe as a follow- up, you should do a story on Nova.
You know, how Manuel Pla saved the company after the terrorist attack... and turned its fortunes around.
Fair and balanced, of course.
- Of course.
- Good.
An Agent Brechner from Interpol called three times this morning.
"The Great Game."
It' s a term the British used during World War I for espionage.
They used people as game pieces and the world as a board.
A board game.
Kind of like Monopoly.
Except in Monopoly, the game pieces don' t die.
- Listen, Agustin was murdered.
- I know.
There' s a new player in the game.
Leila' s partner, Paul Wolf.
Six feet tall, German, very professional.
Listen, I' ve been getting calls, anonymous tips.
What?
As a patsy, to cover up his crimes.
Goddamn terrorists.
Now they' ve joined the media.
Why didn' t you tell me sooner?
I was hoping for a scoop.
Don' t be an idiot, Robinson.
These people will eat you for breakfast.
If they contact you again... please, let me know.
Day or night.
- Consider me...
I was going to say "ally."
Mr. Robinson?
I' m sorry.
Miss Markham told me to give this to you.
She wanted me to hand it to you directly.
She sounded very mysterious.
What is it?
The police report on Agustin' s death.
Who' s winning?
Would you get me another drink, please?
This is for VlPs only.
How did you get in here?
The security guard was female.
She was susceptible to my charm.
- Big fan, huh?
- He' s going to foul.
Yeah.
One could draw some startling conclusions.
- The forward centre is a star.
- at five minutes to 1 1: 00 in the morning...
McGovern knew about this.
Our boss is involved in this.
Agustin never stood a chance.
- I' m glad you' re in this with me.
- No, you can count me out.
- These guys, they don' t blush at much.
- You scared?
If you were going to sit it out, why did you bait me?
You were hungry, out to get a name.
Here' s a story, now go fetch it.
So, I get my head blown off, and you sit behind your desk?
Hank, when you' ve seen what I' ve seen, and you' ve lived what I' ve lived... then you can judge me.
If I can help without exposing myself, I will.
It' s not big enough.
See you at the water cooler, Nicola.
Hello, Mr. Robinson.
lmagine running into you here.
Relax.
Perhaps we --
Yeah, but the only problem was he didn' t understand a word I was saying.
- Quite -- - So, what' s the joke?
- Hank, good to see you.
- Nice to see you.
Tell us what our star reporter has been up to.
Well, I was shot, chased, nearly killed.
All in a day' s work, you know.
How about you?
Murder any competitors lately?
Hank, why don' t I get you a drink?
Enjoy yourselves.
You' ve been reading too many spy novels, Hank.
How did you know what was in Agustin' s police report before it was issued?
I have an amazingly good contact in the Barcelona police force.
- Who?
- Hank!
A good reporter never reveals his sources.
- You' re lying.
Truth is in the eye of the beholder.
There is only one absolute truth:
Truth is power.
The anarchist attack on Nova.
Orchestrated to remove an obstacle... that stubborn old fool, Sert... and put Manuel Pla in charge.
- Framing Agustin?
- Another obstacle removed.
Now, Pla has his finger in the Internet and telecommunications pie.
Why are you doing this?
The Internet is dangerous.
It allows people to get information they cannot be trusted with.
It must be controlled... step by step.
Until, eventually, people like you are running the whole show.
I' m wondering what the Chief Magistrate is going to think about this.
Why don' t we ask him?
He' s one of my guests.
He' s right down there, see?
I believe you' ve already made his acquaintance.
Of course, we will have to tell him the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth... including your pilfering of the Aribau story.
Oh, yes, I knew all along.
That' s why I hired you.
Well, we' re the same, you and I.
Unbound by petty moral concepts of good and evil... we see what has to be done, and we do it.
- Men like us rule the world.
Yes.
We are governed only by our desires.
Me, it' s power.
For you, I' d say respect.
Look, the crime is not stealing the story, son.
The crime is getting caught.
So, why don' t we join the party?
There are some people I' d really like you to meet.
They, too, have done what it takes.
Manuel Pla:
Triumph over Adversity.
I' m a whore.
- Mr. Robinson, you have a call on Line 1.
- Thank you.
- Robinson.
- It' s me.
We cleaned up the tracking.
- God, Hank.
It' s horrible.
- All right.
Play it.
Stop it!
It' s enough!
What?
Did you have to make such a scene?
Aribau filmed the whole thing, right?
Nobody will suspect me.
He saw what we wanted him to see.
Oh, Jesus.
These people are savages.
We have to broadcast this, Hank.
Oh, God.
All right, don' t do anything yet.
Okay.
Important call?
Don' t you knock?
The plan?
Well, I thought I' d finish my puff piece on Manuel Pla... go down to the local watering hole, get shit- faced, and try and get laid.
Yesterday, you were going to change the world.
- Well, I thought better that.
- So you' re going to do nothing?
You' re the one that wanted to leave it alone.
So it' s people like you and me that help McGovern get away with murder.
Listen to Hank, Jr.!
You and your daddy are cut from the same cloth.
- Let' s leave my father out of it.
- No, I don' t think so.
It must have been tough growing up in the great man' s shadow.
But let me cut him down to size for you.
Howard Robinson covers the Islamic revolution... that topples the Shah of Iran.
He backs it up with eyewitness accounts of atrocities and mass murders.
Truth is, he spent most of his days in the Tehran Hilton, shagging me.
Bullshit.
His stories were ripped off from local Persian journalists... most of whom, I might add, did not survive the Ayatollah' s purges.
No witness, no one to expose him.
What, nothing to say?
Hank, look on the bright side.
He would' ve been so proud of you.
No, with all due respect, I think you' re wrong.
No, you should lead with this, then pick this up later.
- It is much stronger, believe me.
- Yes, okay.
Our report on Señor Pla.
- Fair and balanced, I hope.
- Just like you asked for.
Good lad.
You know, Nicola, I think our Hank is beginning to tire of Barcelona.
Perhaps we should find a more interesting spot for him.
Baghdad, say, or Kabul?
- I' m so sorry, Archie.
- No, it' s my fault.
- I' m such a klutz!
- It' s all right.
- No problem.
- Thank you very much.
- You' re welcome.
Now.
Just wanted to let you know that we' re going to do a story on you.
One I think you' il be rather pleased with.
Well, let me see.
"Computer genius..." and Internet pioneer. "
Wait.
"Legendary entrepreneur."
When we are finished, the whole world will want to get into bed with you.
The sky is the limit.
Robinson is a good dog.
He' il fetch and do as he' s told.
Besides, it would be rather unfortunate to have to... put down another journalist.
Nicola!
My turn to run into you.
Any special plans tonight?
Those are top secret.
- Is it Chanel you' re wearing?
- Archie!
- Who' s the lucky man?
- I' il never tell.
Do I know him?
You' il never get away with this, you know.
Dating fellow employees is against company regulations.
Okay, I' il quit.
- Look, let me give you a ride.
- No, thanks, Archie.
- You' re not going my way.
- Goodbye.
I' m so sorry, Archie.
Nicola, you sneaky little devil.
Nicola!
- I had the story in my hands.
- All right.
I loved your father.
I' il nail them to a wall.
I swear to you.
What are you waiting for?
Impress me.
Brechner.
Listen, they killed her, okay?
Nicola.
They killed Nicola.
Meet me at 7tv, all right?
We end this now.
Robinson!
- Hank, what happened?
- Don' t ask.
- Listen, is the tape set?
- Okay.
Brechner.
Go round back.
Make sure the rats don' t escape.
I' m calling the cops.
- Hello.
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Brechner.
- No, no, no.
Call me Crusader.
Yeah, that' s it.
- He' s on his cell phone.
- Keep him talking.
If I can find his frequency, we can broadcast it from the studio.
- Listen, maybe we can cut a deal.
- I' m afraid not, pal.
You' re not working out as we had hoped.
Your resignation is required.
- I even convinced McGovern to recruit you.
- I' ve got his frequency.
I followed you for a week after the Nova incident.
You never showed any sign of remorse, not once.
I said, "This is our guy!"
I even cleaned up after you.
Remember Joaquim?
A few drops of hydrochloric acid in a glass of beer... problem solved, if you know what I mean.
- Nicola?
Straight to the aorta.
Melts away the protective cardiac tissue.
Looks just like a heart attack, don' t you think?
Very clean.
Hey, that' s my set.
Hank, I had help.
You helped me.
They are all dead because of you.
You endangered their lives just so you could get one step closer.
To what, Hank?
The top?
Greed.
So ugly, isn' t it, Hank?
I may have done the deed, but you sure made it easy.
- Listen to me, you son of a bitch!
- Now, now, now, Hank!
You should be thanking me.
You' re not dead.
I' ve allowed you to.
- Why don' t you go to hell?
- Maybe I will.
But after you, my friend.
And Hank, when you get there... say hi to Carlos Aribau.
Hello.
I don' t think so.
You know, this is the second time I' ve had to hold a gun to your head.
You remember.
I think I' ve let you live long enough.
God damn it!
This is so sweet.
Everything is all right.
What?
Good thing your friend Pedro called the police... when he saw your impromptu broadcast.
We' ve been tracking these two for months.
So he was using your identity as a cover, and you' ve been...
- following me to get to him.
- Well, I' m sorry.
- Excuse me.
I got to go.
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?
I' ve been better.
I' m sorry.
The tape will destroy Pla.
It' s finally over.
Not quite.
Did you have to make such a scene?
Aribau filmed the whole thing, right?
Nobody will suspect me.
He saw what we wanted him to see.
The evidence of the released videotape led to the immediate arrest of Manuel Pla.
The damning video was shot by... journalist Carlos Aribau and his cameraman.
I stole it.
I apologise to them... and to you.
As journalists, we have all taken a sacred oath... to report nothing but the truth.
But sometimes... in the mad race for glory and ratings... we forget our promise.
It' s then your duty to remind us... to keep us vigilant, to keep us honest... to keep us fair.
Because in the end... you get the press you deserve.
This is Hank Robinson for Vision TV... signing off.
What are you all staring at?
Get back to work!
What the hell do you think you' ve done?
By ruining me, you' ve only achieved your own destruction, son.
I' m not your son, I have a father, you piece of shit.
- Don' t -- - Temper, McGovern.
You don' t want us to add assault to the other charges.
Not that it would make much difference.
- Take care, Mr. Robinson.
- Thank you.
Hey, Marisa.
What was it?
"Believe nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see."
Words to the wise.
That' s for you.
Thank you.
- Mr. Robinson.
- Yeah?
I' il think about it.
Fifteen hundred years ago...... most of Europe had abandoned its old beliefs...... and turned to the Christian faith.
Only in the North did the people hold on to the gods of their ancestors.
The most powerful of these gods was Odin.
He reigned among the stars in Valhalla...... and his ravens gave him wisdom and memory.
But whilst the fire of the ancient powers faded...... a wondrous tale arose that captured the hearts of the people.
It told of a blacksmith who slew a mighty dragon...... and won a legendary treasure.; The dragon gold.
- Where are we going?
- Quick!
My king!
We can' t hold the wall much longer.
We can' t stay.
Take our son and go.
I' m not leaving you.
Siegfried!
Xanten whelp!
Siegfried.
- My son.
- Go now.
Go!
My brother always watches out for me.
This way, my lady.
What do we do?
We must cross here, my qu ee n.
- Where are they?
- Come on.
Get up on here.
Siegfried.
Hold on.
Hold on.
My son.
A little early for a morning swim, isn' t it?
Who are you, boy?
What happened?
What happened?
I don' t know.
I can' t remember.
12 YEARS LATER
What do you s ee?
Be patient, child.
Odin' s powers are in the runes.
They never lie...... but they won' t be rushed.
- Don' t k ee p me waiting.
Fire will rain down from the sky very soon.
Tell me more.
And the light of that fire will reveal your destiny.
So far from home.
What destiny could I have here?
After the fire, a man will come...... a man as strong as you.
The warrior' s strength will match your own.
He will even best you in battle.
No one' s ever done that before.
No one else ever will.
We should anchor for the night soon.
I better get the cargo ready for the king.
You work on this.
All right.
- Whoa.
- Whoa, whoa.
Gr ee tings.
How can I help you?
We' re looking for Eyvind the blacksmith.
That' s me.
They say your iron is the best around.
What can I do for you?
What swords have you got?
Well, right now, nothing at all.
I can s ee a lot of "nothing" right there inside.
They were made for King Gunther of Burgund.
Well, he' s not here, and we are.
Meaning that you plan to steal King Gunther' s property?
"Stealing," he says.
Just count yourself lucky we aren' t offended.
Eric, I think your iron is getting cold.
Good day to you.
I don' t like Saxons.
I do, once in a while.
Yeah, I know.
For sword practice.
Look at that pale path of light.
That' s the road to Valhalla.
I wish I could s ee them sitting up there.
All the great heroes at table with the gods.
- And they' re watching over us mortals.
- But why do they care about us?
They n ee d us just as much as we n ee d them.
We' il fight on their side when the evil powers attack us.
But how do we know what they want us to do?
They map out our destinies.
They' ve given you all the signs in the sky.
If they s ee, from up there, that we do something that' s bad for us, they...
They get furious.
The Christians say their god is all about forgiveness.
The Christians?
They are a strange lot.
Look.
It' s Ragnarök.
The gods go to war.
- I wanna take a closer look.
Don' t go.
We should never meddle with the gods.
Never.
You' re the woman from the longship.
And you' re the man from the smithy.
A tamer of fire and the elements.
Then maybe you can tell me what this is.
Some kind of strange metal.
I' ve never s ee n its like before.
Imagine the weapon one might forge from it.
- Is this metal the reason you came?
- No.
You are.
Never mind him, blacksmith.
Tell me something.
Do you believe in destiny?
Why?
We were both sent a sign that would bring us together here.
That sign was big enough for the whole country to s ee.
The only ones here are you and me.
Today the runes promised...... to lead me to a man whose strength would be as great as mine.
And you defeated me.
I just wrestled you down.
No one has ever done that before.
Until now.
So you s ee, we were meant to m ee t.
- Why don' t you stay here with me?
- Oh, Eric, I would love to.
But like you, I have duties to perform.
But I will wait for you.
But where will I find you?
Iceland.
But there might be more than just one Brunhild in Iceland.
Not more than one who is qu ee n.
You' re the Qu ee n of Iceland?
Yes.
Does that make a difference?
No.
- Not to how I f ee l about you.
- Good.
Because no matter what happens, I will love you forever.
I promise I will come.
Well, the gods wanted it to happen.
But I' m a blacksmith, and she is a qu ee n.
Up North are many tales about blacksmiths who became kings.
Really?
There have always b ee n things that were different about you.
Maybe she felt them too.
Father, take me with you on your journey to Burgund this year.
Why?
Maybe the river holds an answer to what happened before you found me.
You were never curious about that before.
It never really mattered before.
Maybe last night changed you.
I don' t know anything about myself.
I' ve never even left the smithy.
And now I f ee l I must.
Let' s get the boat ready.
We' il leave tomorrow morning.
Thank you.
Thank you, Father.
What' s that?
Is it a war?
It sure looks like that.
But who' s the enemy?
King Gunther is at peace with the Saxons.
Up here.
- Alberich.
- Lord Hagen.
I s ee you have not changed.
Nor have you.
I got your message.
What is it you want now?
Fafnir the dragon is awake.
You must convince King Gunther to gather his best warriors and kill Fafnir.
Why would I put their lives at risk, and mine?
I don' t care about the dragon.
You wouldn' t say that if you knew what was hidden in his cave.
Go on.
The ancient treasure hoard of the Nibelungs.
You' ve b ee n babbling about that...... ever since they cast you out for trying to thieve it.
Now you want me to believe the hoard is here?
The dragon was sl ee ping on it.
So you' ve wasted years of the mortal life they cursed you with...... and the treasure was under your nose the whole while.
That' s funny.
You won' t laugh so hard when you' ve s ee n it.
You' ve never dreamed of such a hoard of gold and jewels.
Why would I help you and not k ee p the whole hoard for myself?
We know each other too well, you and I.
Some of my blood courses through your veins.
Enough.
Don' t ever dare to speak of it.
You know it' s true.
Hold your tongue!
I know that you' re ashamed of where you come from.
But remember how many times I' ve helped you with my magic.
We could help each other now.
Very well.
I' il choose the best of the king' s men.
Move fast.
There again, why do things by half?
- All right, Kriemhild, let it go.
- Ready?
Go.
So much for the pigeon.
I n ee d to work on that bird' s hunting technique.
If he ever comes back.
Good to s ee you.
Good to s ee you, my friend.
There he is.
Are you sure he' il come back?
Of course.
He knows I' m his lord and master.
Very well, lord and master, go get him back.
What a beautiful bird.
- Give him back.
He belongs to me.
- What' s its name?
Arminius.
Like the hero who chased the Romans out of the country.
Yes, now give him back to me, boy.
Who are you calling a boy, boy?
I' m the king' s brother, and I call common men what I please.
Did you hear that?
What?
What' s that?
He says I' m no common man, but the tamer of fire and the elements.
And that' s what you should call me.
Shall we try again?
Stop that nonsense, Eric.
Give back the hawk to Prince Giselher.
At once.
I hoped you wouldn' t give up so easily.
I' il get you a new one.
- Eyvind.
- Oh, Lord Dankwart.
We' ve b ee n waiting for you.
I' m glad you got here safely.
We saw the devastation coming up the river.
It' s a dragon.
Fafnir, they call it.
The monster came out of nowhere and started killing, destroying everything.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
Now, look at this.
This is even better.
You have a good eye for blades, my king.
Forged and tempered by my son here.
It' s well- balanced in order to make it move like an extension of your arm.
- You' ve learned your craft well.
- Thank you, my king.
I' ve always said there' s no better weapon- maker in the land.
Eyvind, you arrived just in time.
I n ee d your best iron to help my men fight the dragon.
Brother, with this sword I could fight the dragon at your side.
- Let me come with you.
- You know my answer, Giselher.
It is not wise to put two princes of Burgund in danger at the same time.
You handle it very well, Prince Giselher.
The balance is perfect for you.
It' s yours.
A simple gift.
Thank you.
The creature should be hunted down.
I, too, ask to join your quest against the dragon.
That task is only for warriors most honoured and favoured by the king.
Please excuse his impetuous youth, my king.
I know exactly how you f ee l.
What did you think, Eric?
The king would be waiting for you to kill the dragon for him?
I can do it.
With your mouth you can.
Make sure it reaches the right temperature.
Aren' t you helping me with this?
It' s your sword.
Didn' t I teach you how to do it?
Yes, you did.
Then do it.
I will love you forever.
To the forest of Fafnir.
May God be with us, and grant us swift victory.
Open the gates.
Don' t stare at the princess.
It' s not polite.
I' m not staring.
She is, though.
Tamer of fire and the elements...... may I enter?
- You may.
And please do call me Eric.
I' m Prince Giselher.
Well, would you care to pump the bellows, prince?
Thank you.
I came to thank your father for the sword.
I neglected to do so earlier.
Oh, he' s asl ee p now.
But I' il let him know you stopped by.
I' ve never met a blacksmith who knows how to use the sword so well.
Father says you can' t forge a sword if you don' t know how to use one.
- It' s good to have a father like that.
- What about your father?
My father was killed in a battle years ago.
My mother died soon after.
How do you know when the iron' s ready?
The f ee l.
The way it looks.
This one will n ee d hammering for days.
It must be wonderful to make things with your hands.
Do you have a talent or a craft?
I' m a prince.
I' m not allowed to work.
It would disgrace my brother, the king.
- Don' t you get bored?
- Yes.
If it weren' t for my sister, I' d go mad.
She' s quite a pretty girl.
Every nobleman in our kingdom wants her.
She doesn' t want any of them.
Who does she want then?
Why do you ask so many questions?
Are you smitten by her too?
My heart is elsewhere.
I just hope my brother is able to kill the dragon.
The king!
The king is returning!
Gunther!
Gunther!
The dragon' s hide was hard as iron.
Our weapons were useless against it.
Take him in.
Careful.
He will be avenged, my lady.
I swear it.
This is your masterpiece, my son.
What will you call him?
I don' t know.
Why?
A sword as great as this des erve s a name.
Then I shall call you "Balmung."
Balmung?
Balmung was the sword of the last King of Xanten, destroyed in battle.
Why do you want to call him that?
I just like the sound of it.
Fafnir!
Come out!
Come out, you worm!
Fafnir, I' m right here!
That' s it.
Come out!
Come on!
Blood...
Bathe in the dragon blood.
In the dragon blood.
Bathe in the dragon blood.
If you are wise, you will leave empty- handed.
This gold is not for humankind.
It belongs to us.
I think it belonged to the dragon.
We are the k ee pers of the gold.
Gold that only we can hold.
The hoard was ours till Fafnir stole it from us.
H ee d our warning, or you too will pay.
Who are you?
The Nibelungs.
The people of mist and twilight.
You gave the gold back to us by slaying Fafnir.
And we thank you for it.
Thanks are all very well.
But I' m the one who risked my life to kill the dragon.
That should be worth something.
It is not worth a single coin of this treasure.
Not when it comes with a curse.
- I don' t believe in curses.
- The proof is outside.
Fafnir lies dead because of it.
I think he lies dead because of me.
And what' s this?
That is the ring of the Nibelung.
The oldest thing in the hoard.
Its heart.
The one who possesses it is the treasure' s owner.
- It' s beautiful.
- And as deadly to you...... as anything else here.
It' s gonna take more than just words to frighten me today.
I' il be back for it soon.
When the curse begins to bite, beware...... for it will find your weakness, and through it, destroy you.
- What sorcery is this?
- Give it back.
Who are you?
- I should' ve known better.
- What?
It' s made your skin impenetrable.
I killed the dragon.
What' s to stop me from killing you?
The magical Tarnhelm.
You can k ee p it.
It made me take your shape.
What do I n ee d that for?
I look like me already.
Yes, but with it, you can wear any shape you desire.
- Prove it.
- Put it on your head.
Listen, are you trying to...?
You must say the magical words:
Shadows and vapours, all the same.
And you must think who it is you want to turn into.
Shadows and vapours, all the same.
You look really ugly.
Then I must look like you.
Are you going to spare me?
Go.
Another mistake, young mortal.
Now you also own his enmity.
- And the curse.
- Why?
Who is he?
His name is Alberich, and he was one of us.
But gr ee d awoke in Alberich.
He wanted the treasure all for himself, like you.
When he tried to steal it...... we cast him out, and stripped his immortality away.
How about we make a bargain?
I' il only take half of the treasure...... you k ee p the rest.
Would that be fair?
Half the treasure, all the treasure, or just that single ring.
It' s enough to bring the whole curse down on you.
It' s all mine now.
Lady, you set tests for your suitors.
Such tests are almost an insult to their rank.
These men who ask for your hand are royal kings and princes.
And I am a qu ee n, their equal.
I have a right in my own land to make whatever laws I please.
- Yes, but...
- Then tell them...... that the Qu ee n of Iceland will wed the man who passes the tests she sets.
And who can defeat her in single combat.
But no man can hope to succ ee d at such tasks, majesty.
One man will succ ee d.
And one man will marry me.
And I will know that man as soon as I s ee him.
You may go.
You are thinking of the man you met on the night the star fell, aren' t you?
The blacksmith?
I have thought of that man ever since.
And I will marry no one else, Hallbera.
Not a prince, not a king, not the Roman emperor himself.
And if your handsome sword- maker does appear, what then?
Are you sure he' s strong and brave enough to pass the tests you planned?
He has defeated me once already.
Only he will defeat me again.
The rune stones do not lie.
It' s Eric.
- Where have you b ee n?
- Hunting.
Any luck?
- What is it?
- What does it look like?
It' s a dragon' s claw.
- Where did you find it?
- On a dragon' s foot.
Of course you didn' t.
You think you can fool your own father?
If you don' t like its claw, how about...... its head?
I don' t believe it.
It really is the dragon!
It' s wonderful.
Fafnir is dead!
Eric the blacksmith killed the dragon!
Yes, he' s dead, do you hear?
The dragon is dead!
Eric killed the dragon!
It' s true!
It' s over, it' s over!
Please, I' m fine.
Gunther.
Eric killed the dragon, alone.
This blacksmith must be blessed by God.
Or the devil.
He succ ee ded where you and 12 of your best warriors failed.
Whatever power he used against the dragon, he could use against you.
He did this for me.
Open your eyes, Hagen, and let your suspicious mind have a holiday.
People of Burgund.
I command that Eric the blacksmith be proclaimed a hero of the kingdom.
Long may he be honoured for his great victory.
Long live the dragon slayer.
Even the honour of guarding such a treasure...... would bring fame to Burgund, my lord.
And respect for its king will increase beyond measure...... once it' s known that you have b ee n entrusted with the safety of the hoard.
- My king, the dragon slayer' s outside.
- Send him in.
It sounds most attractive, Hagen.
But all of these benefits depend upon...... what our young hero has to say.
King Gunther, I am greatly honoured by your offer to hold the treasure...... in safek ee ping for me, but...
I trusted him well enough to kill a dragon on his behalf, Lord Hagen.
Did you?
That was a fair hit, Hagen.
Now, Eric, the word "but" usually means some difficulty.
My king.
It' s only I' m not sure your treasury has enough room.
- Can I s ee your face?
- No, that would ruin everything.
He' s my only son.
I brought him up all by myself.
The father of our saviour.
Not just that.
I' m also a sword- maker, favoured by the king.
And still a pagan.
The hammer of Thor, the god of thunder.
The workingman' s god and my god.
- You' re baptized?
- Yes.
But tonight, I' m pagan again.
Let' s go get some water.
What does a dragon slayer do now that there are no dragons left to slay?
He goes home to his smithy.
With all the gold you brought back, you don' t n ee d to work.
My father taught me the art of changing charcoal and ore into iron...... and I enjoy doing it.
Defeat dragons with iron, but win maidens with gold.
How many?
One?
Two?
A dozen?
None.
My heart is pledged already.
Who is this fortunate lady?
Highborn or low?
High, I think.
Or fear.
Maybe too high.
Perhaps she doesn' t know you love her so d ee ply.
All sorts of arrangements might be made for so great a hero.
- Would I know her?
- No.
She lives far away.
So to whom is your heart pledged?
- Are you married?
- No, I' m not.
If I ever marry, it will only be for love.
Will you finally come to me?
I' m waiting for you, my love.
Do you know who you are at last?
They call me Eric the blacksmith, Eric the dragon slayer...... and Eric the hero of Burgund.
Ah, but these are just titles.
One honest, one honoured, one honourable.
But none of them are who you really are.
The Twin Kings have struck at Odinwood.
They' ve burned our towns and taken our people as slaves.
Even as we speak, Bonna is under siege.
Damn them.
Damn them both.
We' ve lived in peace with the Twin Kings for ten years.
But for most of those ten years...... Burgund' s treasury hasn' t b ee n filled to overflowing with Fafnir' s hoard.
Gr ee d will negate any treaty.
How strong is their army?
- Four, perhaps, 5000 men.
- We can match them in strength.
But they' re on the move.
Send messengers to all our towns.
Muster the army.
We leave at once.
But my king...... Eric the blacksmith owes you no allegiance.
But he killed Fafnir on your behalf.
If he agr ee d to join our army...... I' m certain it would encourage our warriors.
And discourage the enemy.
To m ee t a man who slew a dragon single - handed...... would give anyone a pause for thought.
No, ask that he ride with the Burgund host.
- Brother, I...
- I honour your intention...... but this is not about glory.
If we don' t come back, you must live to defend Burgund.
And your sister.
Meanwhile...... we ride.
Go.
King of the Burgunds, my masters, Kings Thorkwin and Thorkilt...... do not wish for this battle.
Since we outnumber you, I believe that.
We will spare your lives, and spare Burgund its certain devastation...... if you yield up to us the dragon gold.
I am the wrong man to ask for the gold.
If your masters want the gold...... they must take it up with the man who slew the dragon.
- Let me talk to them, my king.
- No.
I will never allow this.
- We will fight them together.
- It is my treasure, my king.
And I f ee l enough blood' s b ee n spilled over it already.
My king, if the dragon slayer can help avoid more bloodshed...... then let him.
If he fails, we attack.
Another messenger.
I hear you want something of mine.
I' m the lord of the dragon' s gold.
If you want it, you' re welcome to try to take it.
But you have to fight me first.
Big words for a blacksmith.
It takes more than gold to make a man worthy to fight a king.
And it takes more than a crown to make a man be a king.
You' re nothing more than a Burgund whelp.
Xanten whelp!
You killed my father!
I am Siegfried, son of Siegmund, King of Xanten.
You' re beaten.
And your kingdoms will be divided...... betw ee n the Kings of Burgund and Xanten.
I should kill you both for what you did.
But that wouldn' t give me any satisfaction.
Just get out of my sight.
I want him tied to the house of Burgund forever.
What do you have in mind, my king?
My sister will marry Siegfried of Xanten.
And I' m sure you will not find this too difficult to arrange.
Go now!
Father, I' m awakened at last.
I finally know who I am.
A king.
And worthy, I hope, of a qu ee n.
Come to Iceland, my love, and find out.
Soon, my love.
But I' ve won a mighty treasure, and I wanna bring it home for you.
Siegfried, you are the only treasure that I wish for.
Hurry, my love, I' m waiting.
And now you send for me.
What do you want?
Siegfried means to take the treasure to his father' s castle in Xanten.
He must be stopped.
From what I hear, a whole army couldn' t stop him.
King Gunther wants him bound to Burgund...... through marriage to Kriemhild.
But there' s some other woman.
What do you have in mind?
One of your cantrips, spells or potions.
If he could forget his other love and find the princess attractive instead?
Then the gold stays where it is.
I think I can help you...... if the price is right.
- What do you want?
That boy took something from me.
It looks like a mask.
The man who knows its secret can look like anyone else.
- Siegfried knows that secret.
- Interesting.
Get me the Tarnhelm back, and the potion' s yours.
The potion first, thief.
Once I have proof that it works, you' il get your Tarnhelm.
You' il have it the day after tomorrow, my son.
Don' t ever call me that.
But my son you are.
If killing you could change it, I would' ve done so long ago.
As the moon wanes, the heart wanders.
Sweet memories dwindle, the heart grows cold.
Drinking the draught, mak e new love sweeter.
Past love a memory, withered and old.
Power...
Nothing prevaileth, grey iron nor silver.
As the moon wanes, the heart wanders.
Sweet memory dwindles, the heart grows cold.
Drinking the draught, mak es new love sweeter.
Past love a memory, withered and old.
Against potion' s power, nothing prevaileth.
Grey iron nor silver, jewel nor gold.
Father?
Father.
Father.
What' s the matter?
Are you sick?
If old age is a sickness, yes.
You' ve just b ee n working for a long time.
But there' s no n ee d to work anymore.
There' s all the gold we ever n ee d.
Don' t tempt me with gold, son.
Iron is my metal.
You' re just tired, Father, that' s all.
I' il get you something to eat.
"Father."
Can you still call me that?
Your true father was a king.
You knew?
I suspected it.
I saw the mark of the royal house on your tunic.
And later I learned that the Twin Kings were looking for the lost son...... but never found him.
Because you gave me another name to protect me.
It would be a lie to say that that was the only reason.
You s ee, I never had a wife.
But with you, I got a son.
And...
And it was such a joy to be a father.
Your father.
And I' ve always b ee n proud of you.
I wanted you to know that.
And whatever I am, it' s because of what you taught me.
Listen.
The world around us is in the throes of great change.
And the new powers struggle with the old for domination.
And I' ve done my part in that struggle.
So when my time comes...... my body can descend to the gods in the old way...... the way of fire and water.
But you and your qu ee n are children of the old world too.
The gods gave you wondrous powers...... and you must fulfil your destiny together...... wherever it leads you.
I' il bring my love with me to Xanten as my wife.
I promise you.
But you' re gonna come with me.
I have no more travelling left in me.
I have hardly even breath anymore.
There' s still so much for you to do.
So many swords to make.
My best blade is forged.
There' s no n ee d to bother with lesser ones.
My throat is dry, son.
That drink you said you were going to get me, I could use that now.
Of course, Father.
I' il be right back.
Father?
Father!
But the true hero never dies.
In our memory he will live forever.
My love.
So near to my heart and my mind.
Yet so far from my arms and my body.
How much longer?
How much farther?
Yes?
My lady Kriemhild.
May I please speak with you?
I wish to be alone, Lord Hagen.
It' s about Siegfried.
What about him?
I expect him back any day.
Of course he will come back, for the treasure.
And not because of you?
What are you implying, Hagen?
I have noticed you have f ee lings for him.
You speak of matters you know nothing about.
I know, my Lady Kriemhild...... that you have loved the dragon slayer since the first moment you saw him.
And I have come here to help you.
Once the treasure is gone, there is nothing to k ee p him here.
- What is that?
- Certain herbs...... with interesting properties.
Which, if correctly brewed, will make a heart grow warm.
That is wrong.
That is no Christian thing.
It is the old magic of spells and curses.
All he must do is to drink this mixed with wine...... and so long as it is you who gives him the cup...... any love for any other woman will be forgotten.
And only you will burn in his heart from that moment on.
But why?
In battle and in council...... I have always s erve d the house of Burgund...... and the best interests of the kingdom.
IN THE STORY SO FAR...
- My son.
- Go now.
Who are you, boy?
What happened?
I can' t remember.
Fire will rain down from the sky very soon.
After the fire, a man will come.
The warrior' s strength will match your own.
He will even best you in battle.
Do you believe in destiny?
We were meant to m ee t.
- Yes.
Does that mak e a difference?
No.
Not to how I f ee l about you.
I will love you forever.
- Don' t stare at the princess.
- I' m not staring.
She is, though.
Lord Hagen.
Fafnir the dragon is awake.
You must convince King Gunther to gather his best warriors and kill Fafnir.
I ask to join your quest against the dragon.
That task is only for warriors most honoured and favoured by the king.
To the forest of Fafnir.
The dragon' s hide was hard as iron.
Our weapons were useless against it.
He will be avenged, my lady.
I swear it.
This gold is not for humankind.
It belongs to us.
That is the ring of the Nibelung.
The oldest thing in the hoard.
The one who possesses it is the treasure' s owner.
It comes with a curse.
Fafnir lies dead because of it.
Heed our warning, or you too will pay.
- What sorcery is this?
- The magical Tarnhelm.
With it, you can wear any shape you desire.
His name is Alberich, and he was one of us.
But greed awok e in Alberich.
He wanted the treasure for himself.
- Like you.
- It' s all mine now.
Eric the blacksmith killed the dragon!
Fafnir is dead!
I command that Eric the blacksmith be proclaimed a hero of the kingdom.
Even the honour of guarding such a treasure...... would bring fame to Burgund...... once it' s known that you have b ee n entrusted with the safety of the hoard.
Defeat dragons with iron, but win maidens with gold.
My heart is pledged already.
- Would I know her?
- No.
She lives far away.
And I will marry no one else, Hallbera.
Not a prince, not a king, not the Roman emperor himself.
I' il bring my love with me to Xanten as my wife.
- But you' re gonna come with me.
- I have no more travelling left in me.
I have hardly even breath anymore.
They call me Eric the blacksmith, Eric the dragon slayer...... and Eric the hero of Burgund.
I am Siegfried.
Son of Siegmund, King of Xanten.
You' re beaten.
Your kingdoms will be divided...... betw ee n the kings of Burgund and Xanten.
I want him tied to the house of Burgund forever.
My sister will marry Siegfried of Xanten.
And I' m sure you will not find this too difficult to arrange.
- What do you have in mind?
- One of your cantrips...... spells or potions.
If he could forget his other love and find the princess attractive instead?
Then the gold stays where it is.
So near to my heart and my mind.
Yet so far from my arms and my body.
How much longer?
How much farther?
All he must do is to drink this mixed with wine...... and so long as it is you who gives him the cup...... any love for any other woman will be forgotten.
And only you will burn in his heart from that moment on.
Fifteen hundred years ago...... most of Europe had abandoned its old beliefs...... and turned to the Christian faith.
Only in the North did the people hold on to the gods of their ancestors.
The most powerful of these gods was Odin.
He reigned among the stars in Valhalla...... and his ravens gave him wisdom and memory.
But whilst the fire of the ancient powers faded...... a wondrous tale arose that captured the hearts of the people.
It told of a blacksmith who slew a mighty dragon...... and won a legendary treasure.; The dragon gold.
King Siegfried of Xanten.
I came to thank you for your hospitality.
You are always welcome.
I know that the treasure has brought your kingdom...... misfortune and bloodshed, and for that, I apologize.
Please, Siegfried.
Many wars are fought over gold and treasure.
No army ever waged war with a hero such as you among them.
You didn' t destroy lives, you saved them.
You have done the kingdom of Burgund a great service.
- Thank you, my king.
- King Siegfried.
Would you join us in a toast before you leave?
This is a special wine of Burgund...... mixed with spices.
To Siegfried of Xanten.
To the hero who arrived a blacksmith...... and leaves a king.
- King Siegfried of Xanten.
- King Siegfried of Xanten.
Good wine.
Though the spices give it a strange flavour.
Where are Gunther and Hagen?
They left.
Will you make it again for me sometime...... only with less cinnamon?
Of course I will.
But first I must confess something.
What?
At the dragon feast...... you told a masked girl that your heart was already pledged to somebody else.
So it was you.
Forgive me.
I couldn' t say anything because...
Please...... it doesn' t matter...
... because I love you.
I don' t know why it never occurred...
Nothing matters now.
Except that you love me.
And I love you.
Where might my raven be?
I' m proud that Burgund has won you as brother - in- law.
Nobody could bring more honour to our kingdom than you, Siegfried of Xanten.
I want to make your sister my qu ee n before I return to my kingdom.
Unfortunately, in our kingdom...... the law decr ee s that the king must marry before any of his siblings.
How long do we have to wait then?
It' s not that simple.
The qu ee n I desire is a beautiful and powerful woman...... who challenges her suitors to single combat.
Till now, nobody has proved strong enough to defeat her.
- And who is this powerful woman?
- Her name' s Brunhild, Qu ee n of Iceland.
I' ve met her once.
You know her?
Yes.
Her ship sailed by our smithy one day.
How could I forget?
She is of extraordinary beauty.
You said you' ve met her?
I did.
That night a star fell from the sky into the forest near our smithy...... and we met by the crater it made, and we fought.
But why?
I mistook her for a Saxon and wrestled her down.
You mistook the Qu ee n of Iceland for a Saxon?
How did she react?
She was a little surprised, that' s all.
Siegfried...... she is the woman I wish to marry.
Would you help me win her for Burgund' s qu ee n?
How?
By fighting her in my stead.
Wouldn' t she notice?
Not if you wear that magic helmet of yours.
- These powers shouldn' t be misused.
- You' re the man who could defeat her.
King Gunther has given you his only sister in marriage.
Will you not help him win a qu ee n for himself?
Think, Siegfried.
If Brunhild and I marry...... you and Kriemhild can be married the very same day.
I knew what the wagons were carrying when they came...... but I had no idea it could look so beautiful.
It' s yours.
Mine?
The treasure is my wedding gift to you.
But this ring...... is the symbol of our love.
Wear it till I come back from Iceland.
Every day without you will be an eternity.
Come back soon.
And bring my brother back safely.
My king, we found a stowaway hidden amongst the stores.
- Throw him over the side.
- I think you should s ee him first.
Giselher, are you insane?
I only wanted to s ee the Norse women, the great Valkyries who fight like men.
Why, Giselher?
Do you want a warrior woman of your own?
Why didn' t you ask me?
I always ask you, and you always turn me down.
Your place is at home, looking after Burgund.
- Besides, Kriemhild will be worried.
- Kriemhild knows.
I' ve half a mind to send you back in a barrel!
Oh, come on, Gunther.
What boy doesn' t crave an adventure like this?
Sit down.
And those are the Seven Silver Apples of the goddess of youth.
- You know a lot.
- Not as much as my father, Eyvind, did.
S ee over there?
That' s Orwandil, the Giant.
And next to it is Fearr, the bull that he hunts.
And s ee there?
That' s the Spirits' Road, the bright road to Valhalla.
The gods sit up there with the holy dead...... and decide what we should do to help them save the world.
How are we supposed to find out what they want us to do?
They send us signs.
In water...... fire, or in the sky.
What happens if we read those signs wrong?
I don' t know.
He' s coming.
Your future husband is coming.
Siegfried.
- Captain, hoist the mainsail.
- Yes, my king.
Raise the sail!
Qu ee n Brunhild, come quickly.
Welcome to my country, tamer of the fire and the elements.
At last you found your way to me.
The dragon slayer' s fame reaches even here.
It is not I who come to challenge you, great qu ee n.
It is King Gunther of Burgund...... who s ee ks your hand.
I only s erve him.
My qu ee n...... I come here to s ee k your hand in marriage.
We will fight a duel of double - bladed axes.
If you win...... I will wed you.
If I win...... it will cost you your life.
If I fail to make you my wife...... I will die gladly.
The contest commences in one hour.
Giselher, let' s wait outside.
Shadows and vapours, all the same.
Just stay hidden until it' s done.
What about Siegfried?
He' il follow us later.
The dragon slayer doesn' t join you?
He' s already preparing the ship for our return.
The axes.
You can still sail back to Burgund alive.
There!
Come on!
Here!
Come on!
Bow to my future husband...... the King of Burgund.
Now the King of Iceland.
Leave until I call you and close the door.
They make no sense, lady.
Look there.
That means a cloak or a mask.
Something or someone has b ee n hidden...... the way truth is hidden by lies, our eyes are covered by a blindfold.
Is that why Siegfried didn' t recognize me?
There is nothing here.
The gods are silent.
Noble Siegfried...... ever since you came to Burgund in the guise of a humble blacksmith...... many good things have happened in our kingdom.
Around this table are the two men I love most in the world.
Giselher is my brother by birth.
And it would please me...... if you would become our brother by blood.
The dragon' s blood made my skin impenetrable.
But I guess tonight is a night for trust.
This...... is the only place where I can be wounded.
And now both of you share the greatest secret I have.
This cup will hold no lesser drink than the blood of brotherhood.
It will be raised in no lesser toast.
And may those who betray that trust die, dishonoured and accursed.
People of Burgund!
Your qu ee n!
I present my sister, Kriemhild.
I' il be a sister to you as well.
We will celebrate two weddings on one day.
Where' s my Tarnhelm?
We' re not done with it yet.
You can have it in due course.
That wasn' t the deal, Hagen.
- It worked!
It worked!
Now you' re trying to cheat me!
Perhaps I should find a way to have a little talk with the king.
No n ee d for that.
I' il do it!
Qu ee n Brunhild.
- Can I help you?
- I waited for you.
As I said I would.
Siegfried...... what happened?
Did you find you couldn' t love a qu ee n as well as you did a passing stranger?
Or was it the gold?
That has turned many hearts cold before.
I don' t know.
Who shall I ask why you loved me then, and you don' t love me now?
I didn' t.
Don' t lie to me.
You cannot claim you didn' t love me then.
It was your first time, blacksmith.
And mine as well.
And I knew then that the gods had sent you to me...... and me to you.
And you knew it too.
Does that mean nothing?
That' s not how I remember it.
And you never...... loved me?
Even though you said you did?
I was a boy then.
If this is what manhood brings...... I only wish I' d learned this lesson sooner.
But it' s too late now.
Perhaps I should pray...... that I, too, will remember our love so little.
Because I will never know joy again...... till I forget...... or you remember.
King Gunther...... do you take Brunhild as your wife and qu ee n?
I do.
And do you, Brunhild...... accept my king as your rightful husband and lord?
I do.
Do you, Kriemhild...... take Siegfried as your lawful wedded husband?
I do.
King Siegfried...... do you take Kriemhild as your lawful wedded wife?
I do.
I now pronounce you...... man and wife.
This warlike display...... shows our Burgund swords and warriors at their finest.
They could only be bettered by the great Qu ee n Brunhild...... and the extraordinary King Gunther.
Those few of us who were privileged to travel with King Gunther to Iceland...... witnessed a display of incomparable skills.
And King Gunther was the only man who could match...... his beautiful qu ee n in her challenge.
Siegfried could.
But Siegfried didn' t.
Would he like to try?
It would be an honour...... Qu ee n Brunhild.
What weapons shall we choose then?
Weapons that were forged from the same ore...... and have never b ee n crossed.
My spear...... and your sword.
Thank you...... for this chance to recognize my limits.
- What happened?
- I was tired.
- I decided to lie down.
- That' s not what I meant.
- Why did you leave without me?
- Siegfried.
- In front of everyone.
- But you won.
He let me win.
I know a feigned defeat from an honest victory.
He was lucky, that' s all.
He probably gave up so he didn' t go to his marriage bed covered with bruises.
You' re the only woman I' ve ever really wanted.
And you have me.
Or do you?
You want me, my strong husband?
I' m waiting.
No more of this, my qu ee n.
I' ve drunk too much tonight to deal with such foolishness.
- The man who defeated me hadn' t.
- What?
Or maybe you had b ee n drinking.
Some magical potion to give you strength, perhaps?
Well, I' il let you in on a little secret:
My strength...... is a gift from the gods.
And it lies in this belt.
Once you' ve removed it, you' il find a yielding maiden in your arms.
Can the man who survived my challenge not survive his own wedding night?
Brunhild, stop.
Untie me.
Stop this.
Untie me.
Untie me right now.
- Be quiet now.
- Wife, are you mad?
Let me loose!
- Gunther' s a lucky man.
- Not as lucky as I am.
Don' t you think Brunhild' s beautiful?
What a question for such a time and place.
- Siegfried, answer me.
- All right, yes, she' s beautiful.
- But it' s a hard beauty.
- You noticed it then.
- What?
- That coldness.
The angry way she looks at us.
Well, she' s certainly angry about being defeated by Gunther.
I don' t think she likes me much.
Well, maybe because you won your husband without having to fight him.
Hear that?
That' s Thor swinging his hammer.
Probably to tell us about the war god who' s going to be conceived tonight.
Giselher...... you don' t really believe in all this pagan nonsense, do you?
I do.
And so does Siegfried.
And he' s the greatest hero Burgund has ever known.
I believe in what he does:
Living life by the sword.
And I' m going to do the same.
And when I die...... I' il be rewarded by sitting at the warriors' table...... next to Father Odin himself.
You should hear yourself.
- No, they don' t.
They scare me.
The powers in it are uncontrollable, dangerous.
Anyway, it' s not the way we were brought up.
Lena...... I didn' t mean to hurt you.
Brunhild...... please don' t let the servants s ee me like this.
- I' il never try to subdue you again.
- Then let this be a lesson to you.
I might be captive in this gilded cage, but I will never be your wife.
Gunther.
Siegfried.
What' s the matter?
Can I speak openly and know you won' t tell anyone?
Of course.
The qu ee n...
We haven' t...
I mean...
What?
Siegfried, she won' t let me into her bed.
- I' m sorry.
- And Burgund n ee ds an heir.
I must have a son.
If there was anything I could do, I would.
- But this isn' t a battle I can win for you.
- But that' s not true.
You' ve proven that your strength is greater than hers.
And her strength doesn' t even come from her own body.
It comes from a pagan belt that she wears.
- Lf you can get it away from her...
- No!
No, Gunther.
I' m only asking you to take her belt, not substitute for me in some other way.
You' d refuse to help the man who gave you his own sister?
Your magic Tarnhelm worked for us in Iceland, blood brother.
But if you don' t use it here, tonight...... then all of that' s b ee n wasted, and my marriage is a joke.
Shadows and vapours, all the same.
Good night, my king.
Lena.
- You two go ahead.
- Don' t be long.
I have to tell you something.
Come in here.
I love you too.
He just passed this way.
Something very strange is happening here.
I just want us to be happy together...... to be man and wife.
Look at you, my king.
You are a match for me, are you not?
After all, you defeated me in Iceland.
Well, well...... my king regains his st ee l.
Strange how it comes and goes without warning.
Listen, I don' t wanna fight.
- I love you.
- Prove it.
That' s what I n ee ded to know.
Siegfried?
Now you can be my husband.
Where are you going?
To get rid of this pagan witchery.
And when I return...... I expect you to be my wife.
Do you swear to k ee p this secret?
In Iceland, I saw two Gunthers too.
When my brother returned after his victory over Queen Brunhild...... it wasn' t Gunther who arrived in the room.
It was Siegfried.
Gunther had been hiding in there all the time.
I know it wasn' t my brother who defeated Brunhild.
It was Siegfried.
Where have you b ee n?
Kriemhild.
Why aren' t you in bed?
I woke up and you weren' t there.
I couldn' t get back to sl ee p without you, so I waited.
What' s that in your hand?
Nothing important.
Let me s ee.
A woman' s belt?
Why try to hide it?
It' s not what you think.
We' ve only b ee n married one day.
All I can tell you is...... your brother n ee ded me.
What for?
That I cannot tell you.
Why not?
I promised not to.
I swear before all the gods that I remain your true and faithful husband.
So why won' t you answer my questions?
What help did my brother n ee d that took you from your bed at this hour?
And what kind of help leaves a woman' s belt in your hand?
If I told you, I would be breaking a vow of the utmost secrecy.
Break it.
- Open the doors for us, please.
- I cannot do that, my lady.
Why not?
- We have orders from the qu ee n.
What?
No one may enter the church until the Qu ee n of the Burgunds does so.
- You must be joking.
Open the doors.
- We cannot, Lady Kriemhild.
How dare you order the doors of this place closed to me?
I am the king' s own sister.
And I am his wife...... Qu ee n of all Burgund.
It is only right that I should enter before other lesser royals.
- Step aside and let your qu ee n pass.
- You' re no qu ee n of mine, Brunhild.
And how dare you refer to my husband as lesser than anyone?
He even introduced himself in Iceland as Gunther' s servant.
He s erve d your husband well when he defeated you last night.
- What did you say?
- You heard me.
And it was also my husband who conquered you in Iceland.
You insult the Qu ee n of Burgund in public with these lies?
So first I' m a servant' s wife, and now I' m a liar?
Do you recognize this?
- Who gave you that?
- My husband.
Do you believe me now?
He took it from you last night, in your own bedroom.
It surprises me that you couldn' t tell.
Now get out of my way.
I don' t understand how you could reveal my most intimate secret...... and your brother' s, in front of the whole of Burgund.
Kriemhild, I only broke my vow because I counted on your discretion.
I' m sorry.
Please forgive me.
I love you more than life.
Now I' m terrified something awful will happen, and somehow we' il be parted.
No more tears.
In two days, we' il be far away from this place...... far away from your brother and his marriage.
He was wrong to make you a part of it.
He took advantage of your loyalty.
But it' s over now.
I' il attend the hunt with him, and we' il part as friends.
Today, I' il give orders for the gold to be loaded onto our ship.
As soon as the hunt is done...... we can be on our way.
- Can' t it be done any sooner?
I wish...... but we cannot give your brother the impression...... that we leave bearing him ill will.
- I told you he wasn' t to be trusted.
- Never mind that.
What justice can I administer to put this right?
The simple justice laid down in our books of law may not be sufficient.
Siegfried has used magic to help you, it' s true.
But what other use has he made of it?
You' ve heard the people praise him more than you.
Now he has your sister' s hand in marriage.
He has a legitimate claim to the throne of Burgund.
What' s he planning next, my king?
- Your downfall?
- You said the presence of that hoard...... in my chamber would bring me good.
Even if the qu ee n begets a child by you, every tongue in Burgund will wag...... with the gossip that it' s really Siegfried' s bastard.
The kingdom is already rife with the scandal.
It won' t go away.
It will taint you and your house till the end of your days...... unless something is done.
I' il end the alliance and send him away.
- Let him live out his days in Xanten.
- It' s not enough.
You may not care if men scorn you as a weakling and a cuckold.
But what about me?
I was betrayed by the dragon slayer and by you.
I am the Qu ee n of Iceland and Burgund.
I will not be dishonored.
I will be avenged.
There is only one punishment fit for such a crime.
What would you have me do?
It' s very simple.
Siegfried must die.
You can' t mean it.
He' s my friend.
More than my friend...... my blood brother.
After what we' ve shared, a betrayal like that...
I can' t just have him killed.
Either you kill him...... or I kill myself.
My king...... perhaps his punishment could come about accidentally at the hunt.
You know Siegfried is invincible.
And you know as well as I that he is not.
- King Siegfried, shall we ride together?
- Brother - in- law.
- May I join you as well?
- I' d be honoured.
Come on!
Qu ee n Brunhild?
Qu ee n Brunhild, please let me talk to you.
This trouble betw ee n us has to be settled.
Please, Qu ee n Brunhild.
I have something that' s rightfully yours which I must return.
Ind ee d you have something that is rightfully mine.
But it is far too late for you to return it.
You Christians make much of forgiveness.
- Don' t look for such in me.
- I don' t, Qu ee n Brunhild.
All I can do is say how bitter my sorrow is...... for the way I treated you in front of the cathedral.
I was jealous.
And when I thought of what s ee med to be happening, I couldn' t bear it.
Once I loved a man who I thought the gods themselves had sent me.
I loved the whole world because he was in it.
Long we were parted...... but I could bear it...... because I knew he would return one day.
But when he came again...... it was as if his heart had b ee n wiped clean.
I loved him as I had...... but he did not love me.
We were strangers...... as before we had b ee n...... Iovers.
Siegfried?
Siegfried.
Brunhild, I have done you a terrible wrong.
- Let us speak no more of the cathedral.
- I am not.
I speak of something far worse.
What are you talking about?
You have done me no other great harm.
Once I loved a man who did not love me.
And I could not bear it, for the world was an empty place without him.
So when Hagen came to me with an unholy thing...... that would banish the memory of old loves and plant a new one there...... I blinded myself to what was right and gave it to that man to drink.
It was Hagen' s magic.
Siegfried never knew.
And even if he did, there would be nothing he could do against it.
That is my great sin against you...... and him.
And I will do penance for it for the rest of my life.
So I' m not the only one who got lucky.
Well done, brother.
- Have a drink with us.
- I' il wash the blood off first.
Brunhild.
Is Siegfried not back?
We should leave before dark.
I' il go and get him.
Siegfried?
Siegfried?
Siegfried!
No.
Help.
Help!
Help!
Somebody help!
Arminius!
There was an ambush.
A group of Saxons.
Murderer.
How can you accuse me?
What reason do I have to kill a man who' s done us so much good?
Envy and guilt...... and gr ee d.
With Siegfried dead...... you wouldn' t have to face your own weakness and dishonour.
And with him dead, you could k ee p the hoard for yourself.
All of it.
The hoard.
I don' t want it anymore.
You wanted the gold for yourself.
That' s why you slew him.
- We planned it together!
- You' il never have the gold!
But the gold is my Nibelung birthright!
It' s mine!
You insolent son of a dwarf!
K ee p out of this, boy.
He murdered our king!
I order you to arrest him!
Those of you who ally with me...... will be rewarded with gold from the hoard.
And finally betrayed, as he betrayed me.
Hagen of Tronje...... face the fate my gods have chosen.
Your gods are dead!
Soon we will know.
Return this ring to its rightful owner.
Take it back to the Nibelungs.
Arminius.
Today the old gods live again.
No, Giselher.
Today the old gods will die with them.
And the Lord said unto Moses, ’’ Go.
Return into Egypt. ’’
And Moses took his wife and his son and he returned to the land of Egypt.
And Moses took the rod of God in his hand. ’
Let the ambassador from Priam, king of Troy, approach the Pharaoh.
Great Pharaoh, the gift of Troy is a fabulous fabric from the land of the five rivers.
Our thanks to Priam.
It is fabulous indeed.
- It shimmers like the Nile.
- How is it made?
No one knows.
It is spun on the looms of the gods.
They call it silk.
The ambassador from Jericho.
What kingdom has sent you?
The kingdom of the Most High.
- What gifts do you bring?
- We bring you the word of God.
What is this word?
Thus sayeth the Lord God of lsrael, ’’ Let my people go! ’’
The slaves are mine.
All that they own is mine.
I do not know your God, nor will I let lsrael go.
Who are you to make their lives bitter in bondage?
Men shall be ruled by law, not the will of other men.
Who is this God that I should let your people go?
Aaron.
Cast down my staff before Pharaoh that he may see the power of God.
ln this you shall know that the Lord is God.
Mother!
He turned his staff into a cobra!
Nothing of HlS will harm you, my son.
The power of your God is a cheap magician’ s trick.
Jannes.
Mother, look!
Jannes, do you see?
Moses ’ serpent swallows up the others.
You gave me this staff to rule over scorpions and serpents, but God made it a rod to rule over kings.
Hear his word, Rameses, and obey.
Obey?
Are there no magicians in Egypt that you have come back to make serpents out of sticks?
Or cause rabbits to appear?
I will give your staff a greater wonder to perform.
Bear it before your idle people and bid them make bricks without straw.
- How can that be done?
- Let his staff provide them.
Or let them glean straw for themselves.
But their tally of bricks shall not diminish.
So let it be written.
So let it be done.
(Man) Aaron.
Aaron, when do we leave Egypt?
We do not leave Egypt.
But Moses promised us.
But you said we’ d be freed!
I have brought more evil upon you.
God forgive my weak use of his strength.
(Man) Moses, what have you done to us?
It is Pharaoh ’ s order that you be given no straw to make your tally of bricks.
No straw?
How can we make bricks without straw?
You will glean the fields by night.
Your women and children, too.
ls this the deliverer?
You’ ve brought the wrath of Pharaoh upon us!
You put a sword in their hands!
Stone him!
Stone him!
Stand aside!
Come!
Follow!
There goes your deliverer.
Now go find your straw.
Remember the tally must be the same.
Not one brick less.
I cursed you.
Each time Rameses took me in his arms I cursed you, not him, because I love you.
The Moses who loved you was another man.
No, he was not.
You believe you’ ve changed, but you haven’ t.
You call yourself a prophet, a man of God, but I know better.
I don’ t believe only the thunder of a mountain stirs your heart, as you stir mine.
Nefretiri, I have stood in the burning light of God’ s own presence.
It was not he who saved you just now.
I did that.
Why, of all men, did I fall in love with the prince of fools?
But I believe anything you tell me when l’ m in your arms.
Why must you deny me and yourself?
Because I am bound to a God and to a people and to a shepherd girl.
A shepherd girl?
What can she be to you?
Unless the desert sun has dulled your senses.
Does she... grate garlic on her skin?
Or is it soft as mine?
Are her lips chafed and dry as the desert sand?
Or are they moist and red like a pomegranate?
Or is it the odour of sheep?
There is a beauty beyond the senses, Nefretiri.
Beauty like the quiet of green valleys and still waters.
Beauty whose spirit you cannot understand.
Perhaps not.
But beauty of the spirit will not free your people, Moses.
YOU will come to me or THEY will never leave Egypt.
The fate of lsrael is not in your hands, Nefretiri.
Oh, isn’ t it?
Who else can soften Pharaoh ’ s heart?
Or harden it?
Yes.
You may be the lovely dust through which God will work his purpose.
Fill every jar with water.
For seven days there will be none to drink.
- But this well has never run dry.
- And the river is high.
- Whose word is that?
- One who knows.
So fill your jars or go thirsty.
- Miriam is always right.
- Yes, l’ m going back for more jars.
Yes, Joshua.
She comes to the well every day.
Wait and you will see her.
It is wise of Dathan to send you to the well, Lilia, or he might find his water poisoned.
They told me you were dead.
To all I love, Joshua, I am dead.
- Dathan?
Dathan.
Of your own free will?
Of my own free will.
You are no man’ s slave.
The hour of deliverance has come.
Not for me, Joshua.
Hail to thee, great god of the Nile!
Thy waters are the blood of Egypt.
Hail to thee, maker of barley, feeder of cattle, carrier of ships, greatest of all the gods.
Pharaoh of Egypt!
You have not yet obeyed the Lord.
Let my people go!
The point of the sword...
Let him rave that men shall know him mad.
Obey the Lord or he will raise his hand against the waters of the river.
I have come to bless the waters, you have come to curse them.
We will learn if a shepherd god is stronger than the gods of Pharaoh.
Water of life, give drink to the desert and make green the meadow.
Aaron.
Stretch out my staff against the waters.
Look!
Where he’ s touched the river, it bleeds.
The water turns to blood!
Blood flows from the god!
See how it spreads.
It lS blood!
That you may know the power of the Lord, for seven days, Egypt will thirst.
- Seven days without water!
- Pestilence will be everywhere!
Were it seven times seven days, no magician’ s trick will set your people free.
Sacred water, make pure the flood from which you came.
’ And God smote the land with all manner of plagues, ’ but still Pharaoh ’ s heart was hardened. ’
Great one, you hear the cry of Egypt.
They would cry louder if THEY had to make the bricks.
Send them away.
The people have been plagued by thirst, by frogs, by lice, by flies.
They can endure no more.
Why do you bring this worker of evil before me?
The people desert the temples and turn from the gods.
What gods?
You prophets and priests MADE the gods, that you may prey upon the fears of men.
When the Nile ran red, I too was afraid... until word came of a mountain beyond the cataracts which spewed red mud and poisoned the water.
Was it the staff that caused this?
Was it the wonder of your god that fish died and frogs left the water?
Was it a miracle that flies and lice should bloat upon their carrion and spread disease?
These things were ordered by themselves, not by any god!
Now go.
That you may know these things are done of God...
you shall see hail fall from a clear sky and burn as fire upon the ground.
You shall see darkness cover Egypt when the sun climbs high to noon.
And you shall know that God is God and bow down to his will.
Nothing of this Earth can make me bow to you, Moses.
Behold, the hail comes.
When darkness has covered Egypt for three days, your ministers will send for me.
ln the three days of darkness, you have whined like frightened children in the night.
Moses said the sun would shine in three days and it is true.
Let his people go, or Egypt will be barren from the cataracts to the sea.
Will my father free the slaves?
Can taxes be collected from blighted harvests?
Does fear rule Egypt... or do l?
We fear no army of the Earth, but can we fight plagues with swords?
There is no shame in this.
It is not Pharaoh who yields to the slave, but his counsellors.
I have summoned Moses at your request.
(Counsellor) People will bless you, great one.
Does the world bow to an empty throne?
Empty?
Does a Pharaoh harden his heart against his son?
lf you let the Hebrews go, who will build HlS cities?
You told Moses to make bricks without straw.
Now HE tells YOU to make cities without bricks!
Who is the slave... and who is the Pharaoh?
Do you hear laughter, Rameses?
Yes, the laughter of kings in Babylon, in Canaan, in Troy... as Egypt surrenders to the god of slaves!
Bring the Hebrew in.
Go into the garden.
lt’ s not good for a son of Pharaoh to see his father humbled by a son of slaves.
My son, stand beside me.
Have the days of darkness made you see the light, Rameses?
Will you now free my people?
Great one, bid the scribe read the order.
Give me the writing.
You cannot resist the power of his god!
I know not his god!
Neither will I let his people go.
How long will you refuse to humble yourself before God?
lf you bring another plague upon us, it is not your god but I who will turn the Nile red with blood.
As your father’ s father did with the blood of our male children!
lf there is one more plague on Egypt, it is by YOUR word that God will bring it.
And there shall be so great a cry throughout the land that you will surely let the people go.
Come to me no more, Moses, for on the day you see my face again, you will surely die.
So let it be written.
I will give this spawn of slaves and his god an answer the world will not forget!
Commander of the Host, call on the chariots from Talis.
There SHALL be one more plague... only it will come upon the slaves of Goshen!
First- born of each house shall die, beginning with the son of Moses.
You are the shepherd girl that Moses married?
The queen of Egypt lS beautiful... as he told me.
My husband is not here.
ls this Moses ’ son?
Yes, this is our son.
What do you want of us?
You need have no fear of me.
I feared only his memory of you.
You have been able to erase it?
He has forgotten both of us.
You lost him when he went to seek his god.
I lost him when he found his god.
At least he left you a son to cherish.
I am here to save his son.
From what?
From Pharaoh ’ s decree that the first- born of lsrael must die.
Die?
God of Abraham!
Don’ t let him do this!
Not to the children!
A caravan for Midian awaits you and your son.
My chariot will take you to it.
l’ m surprised you noticed me.
You didn’ t at the palace this morning.
Why?
Were you afraid to look at me?
What do you want, Nefretiri?
You, Moses.
Everything about us is coming to an end!
You will destroy Egypt or Egypt will destroy you.
I belong to you, Moses.
She’ s gone with your son to Midian.
Why did she leave?
She knew you’ d try to save the other children before your own son.
From what?
Rameses is massing the Libyan axemen, the chariots, Sardinian swordsmen.
Why?
Tell me why!
To destroy the first- born of lsrael.
Oh, God!
My God!
Out of his own mouth comes thy judgement!
But I have saved your son!
It is not my son who will die!
It is the first- born of Egypt!
YOUR son, Nefretiri!
You would not dare strike Pharaoh ’ s son!
ln the hardness of his heart, Pharaoh brings death to his own son!
But he’ s MY son, Moses.
You would not harm MY son?
I, myself, am nothing.
God’ s power uses me to work his will.
You would not let him do this to me.
I saved YOUR son.
I cannot save yours.
Your god listens to you, Moses.
About midnight, the destroyer will come into the midst of Egypt and all the first- born shall die, from the first- born of Pharaoh to the first- born of his servants.
When you were Prince of Egypt, you held me in your arms.
I threw myself at your feet before the court of Pharaoh.
Because I loved you, Moses.
It is the Lord who executes judgement, Nefretiri.
Go back to your son.
Your love for me is stronger than the power of any god.
You will not kill my son.
Turn from thy fierce wrath, O Lord!
# Death cometh to me
# To set me free
# Death cometh to me... #
No, Lilia, death will not come to you.
Joshua, you risk your life in coming here.
- You are first- born.
- So are you.
I bring lamb’ s blood to mark the doorposts and lintel... that the Angel of Death may pass you by.
Joshua, it is enough that you have come to me.
I am outcast among our people.
Don’ t save me from death, Joshua, save me from life.
Tomorrow will bring a new world.
No!
And no blood on this door!
Dathan, it will save her life!
Moses has God’ s promise!
Moses has words, Pharaoh has spears.
Remember, Joshua, of her own free will she’ s mine.
# And under his wing shalt thou trust # ’’ Though we stand in the shadow of death, ’’ the Lord is our God.
The Lord is one. ’’ (All) ’’ The Lord is one. ’’
# His truth shall be thy shield... # ’’ Shield us through this night of terror, O King of the Universe. ’’ (Woman screams)
Why is this night different from all others?
Because this night the Lord will free us from the bondage of Egypt.
# Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night # (Knock at door)
Or worse!
# Or from the arrow that flyeth by day #
Bithiah!
ln fear of your god they have set me free.
May a stranger enter?
There are no strangers among those who seek God’ s mercy.
My bearers?
All who thirst for freedom may come with us.
The darkness of death will pass over us tonight.
Tomorrow the light of freedom will shine upon us as we go forth from Egypt.
I shall go with you, Moses.
- A princess of Egypt!
- From the house of Pharaoh!
An idol- worshipper!
This woman drew me from the Nile and set my feet upon the path of knowledge.
Mered, bring a chair for Pharaoh ’ s daughter.
There is a great light shines from your face.
Perhaps some day I shall understand it.
He is God’ s messenger, Princess.
lf it is not forbidden to look upon the breath of pestilence, then see, for it is here.
Do not look, Eleazar.
Close the door, Joshua, and let death pass.
Will it pass, Moses?
Will it pass?
That is God’ s promise, Elisheba.
’’ Blessed art thou, o Lord our God ’’ Who bringeth forth bread from the earth. ’’ (Distant shouting)
(Man) Run!
Run!
There shall no evil befall you... or any plagues come near you.
# A thousand shall fall at thy sight #
Why do we eat unleavened bread and bitter herbs?
(Hoofbeats outside) (Man) Faster!
Take the other road!
The herbs remind us of the bitterness of captivity, Eleazar.
This is the bread of haste, that you will remember this night from generation to generation forever.
(Woman) Give me back my baby!
- They are my people!
- All are God’ s people.
Death is all around us!
But it passes those who have believed the Lord.
Always remember, Eleazar... he passed over your house.
Are the captains of Egypt afraid of a night mist?
- The death cry is everywhere.
- Some devil’ s curse!
Look!
l’ ve known battle for 30 years, Pharaoh, but never fear till tonight.
Aide.
Have the captains join their men.
At the coming of dawn we will strike.
No first- born Hebrew shall live.
Let the Hebrews go, great one, or we are all dead men.
He was your son?
My first- born.
There is no magic cure, no spell to use.
He is the first- born of Pharaoh.
We have no skill before this... pestilence.
My father.
My son.
Your own curse is on him.
- Where did you hear this?
- From Moses.
I would not let his people go because your serpent’ s tongue hardened my heart.
You only thought to keep Moses here.
You cared nothing for my throne... or my son.
I asked Moses for his life.
The shadow of death is on his face.
No...
He will not die.
Captain.
Take my fastest chariot.
Bring Moses to me.
I will bring him, mighty Pharaoh.
He’ s my only son.
You have conquered, Moses.
The foot of a slave is on the neck of Egypt.
You were saved from the Nile to be a curse upon me.
Your shadow fell between me and my father, between me and my fame, between me and my queen.
Your shadow now fills all things with death.
Go out from among us, you and your people.
I set you free.
It is not by your word, nor by my hand that we are free, Pharaoh.
The power of God has freed us.
Enough of your words!
Take your people, your cattle, your god and your pestilence.
Take what spoils from Egypt you will!
But go!
O Lord God... with a strong hand thou dost bring us out of bitter bondage.
Tomorrow we go forth a free nation.
For every man shall reap what he has sown and bow no knee except in prayer.
We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters...
With our flocks and with our herds will we go, for I know that the Lord is great and that our Lord is above all gods.
He’ s dead.
Soca, great lord of the lower world...
I, who have denied the gods of Egypt, bow before you now.
Show that you have power above the god of Moses, and restore the life he has taken from my son.
Guide back his soul across the lake of death to the place of living men, and I will raise a temple to you mightier than the pyramids.
Hear me, dread lord of darkness...
Arise, O lsrael!
Behold the dawn of freedom!
’ And it came to pass, after the stifling night of terror, ’ came a day such as the world had never seen. ’ From east and west, from north and south, ’ they came with all they had, driving their flocks ’ and their herds and their camels before them. ’ By tens, by hundreds, by thousands, ’ unending streams of man and beast and burden, ’ and even very much cattle, ’ poured into the Avenue of Sphinxes. ’ Beneath the stone feet of the four colossal images of Rameses, ’ which their own sweat and blood and sinew ’ had hewn from solid rock, ’ a nation arose and freedom was born into the world. ’
(Child) Father, have you got Rebekka?
No, I haven’ t got Rebekka.
Here’ s the trough.
Sling it on your shoulders.
This is a blessed day!
- Here’ s Rebekka!
- Thank you!
- Can we take the cow?
- We’ re moving to the gates.
Rachel, help me with this brick yoke.
Don’ t forget the oil for the baths!
Where are we going?
To some land flowing with milk and honey!
l’ ve never tasted honey.
Anybody know the way?
lt’ s away from the whip!
Freedom will wet your throats in the desert.
This is the governor’ s house!
You cannot enter.
Out!
All of you!
Why do soldiers come here?
I put no blood on my door.
Then stone bleeds!
Your stonecutter did this to me!
All your gold cannot wipe that mark from your door... or from my heart.
For that, you’ il walk all the way to...
Where are we going?
Do you know where we’ re going?
To hell, I hope!
’ Like Dathan, they did not know where they were going, ’ and cared no more than their flocks. ’ Now they used the brick yokes for a very different burden. ’ There went forth among them ’ planters of vineyards and sowers of seeds, ’ each hoping to sit under his own vine and fig tree. ’ Out of this glorious chaos, ’ it is Joshua who brings order and purpose. ’
Set the standard of each tribe before the people!
Levite in the centre, Judah to the right, Hephron left.
(Woman) Watch where you’ re going!
Watch out for my geese!
Aaron and the elders are carrying a shrouded body, Grandfather!
They are the bones of Joseph, to rest in his own land.
Nubians, Grandfather!
- Spoils of Egypt.
All who shared the toil will share this gold!
Here, boy!
For the blind one!
A little golden calf, Grandfather, with horns!
For idol- worshippers!
There are the fire- bearers!
Plant your fires at night beside the standards, that all may light their torches!
Eleazar, hang this on the wagon.
Now the cradle...
I have wagons for midwives and physicians.
Place them at 5, 000 cubits...
l’ il pay you back every lash you gave me, Dathan!
- ls this a day for hard feelings?
- l’ ve felt your whip!
Lilia is no slave, Dathan!
You can carry your own carton.
(Others laugh)
So, now, my brother, we have NEW task- masters.
We serve no masters now!
Yes, but not for long.
- Here.
Old woman.
That’ s it.
- Joshua!
Make way for the governor!
- You know who I am.
- I know who you WERE.
Go and tell Rameses l’ m coming back to my house.
That rabble may follow Moses into the desert today, but when their eyes are seared red by the sun and their cracked lips bleed with thirst, when their stomachs cramp with hunger, they will curse the name of Moses and his god.
Then I will lead them back to Pharaoh and the brick pits.
There are so many.
So many.
How shall I find thy road through the wilderness, Lord?
How shall I find water in the desert for this multitude?
Moses... the people are assembled.
Then let us go forth to the mountain of God, that he may write his commandments in our minds and hearts forever.
We march, praising his mighty name!
- What is the word, Joshua?
- Let the trumpets sound!
Hear, O lsrael!
Remember this day, when the strong hand of the Lord leads you out of bondage!
(All) The Lord is our God!
The Lord is one!
The Lord is our God!
The Lord is one!
Come on!
- Yes!
Come on!
Joshua!
400 years in bondage and TODAY he won’ t move!
# The Lord is one!
Praise to God...
# Thank thee, O Lord... #
My litter can carry him.
I am poured out like water, my strength dried up into the dust... of death.
- We shall plant your fig tree!
- Children shall eat of its fruit!
Do you hear that?
You have a strong new son!
’ And he brought forth the people with joy and gladness. ’ He bore them out of Egypt ’ as an eagle bears its young upon its wings. ’ But again...
Pharaoh ’ s heart was hardened. ’
How many more days and nights will you pray?
Does he hear you?
Dread Lord of Darkness, are you not greater than the god of Moses?
I have raised my voice to you, yet life has not come to the body of my son.
- Hear me!
- He cannot hear you.
He’ s nothing but a piece of stone with the head of a bird.
He WlLL hear me.
I am Egypt.
Egypt?
You are nothing.
You let Moses kill my son.
No god can bring him back.
What have you done to Moses?
How did he die?
Did he cry for mercy when you tortured him?
Bring me to his body!
I want to see it, Rameses!
I want to see it!
This is my son.
He would have been Pharaoh.
He would have ruled the world.
Who mourns him now?
Not even you.
All you can think of is Moses.
You will not see his body.
I drove him out of Egypt.
I cannot fight the power of his god.
HlS god?
The priests say that Pharaoh is a god, but you are not a god, you are even less than a man.
Listen to me, Rameses, you thought I was evil when I went to Moses, and you were right.
Shall I tell you what happened, Rameses?
He spurned me, like a strumpet in the street.
I, Nefretiri, Queen of Egypt!
All that you wanted from me he would not even take.
Do you hear laughter, Pharaoh?
Not the laughter of kings, but the laughter of slaves on the desert!
Laughter?
Laughter?
My son, I shall build your tomb upon their crushed bodies!
lf any escape, their seed shall be scattered and accursed forever!
My armour.
War crown.
Laughter?
I will turn the laughter of these slaves into wails of torment!
They SHALL remember the name of Moses, only that he died under my chariot wheels!
Kill him with your own hands.
Let the trumpet sound.
Alert the watch towers.
Assemble all the chariots at the city gate.
I obey!
Ready my chariot.
I will bring you back your temple treasure!
Bring it back to me stained with his blood.
I will!
To mingle with your own!
(Commander) Salute!
(All) Hail!
(All) Hail!
Remember your first- born!
- (All) Death to the slaves!
- Death to their god!
Hail!
Forward!
Do you hear thunder?
Over the sea?
No, it comes from the desert.
That’ s the thunder of horses!
Look!
Pharaoh ’ s chariot!
We’ re trapped against the sea!
Caleb, warn the north tents!
Joshua?
That’ s Joshua’ s horn!
All men to the pass!
Get horses, wagons!
Form a barrier!
What’ s the alarm?
Pharaoh ’ s chariot!
Block the pass with carts!
Women and children, to the sea!
Bring shovels!
Mallets!
Hear me!
Hear me!
Can mallets stop arrows?
Will your cart stop Pharaoh ’ s chariots?
Women, do you want your men killed?
Moses!
Pharaoh ’ s chariots!
l’ ve ordered men to block the pass!
- We can’ t fight chariots!
- Order the men to move back, Joshua.
Move back?
Where? lnto the sea?
lnto the hand of God.
Deliverer?
He’ s delivered you to death!
Look!
Look!
Blame Moses for this!
Deliver him to Pharaoh!
(All) Yes!
Stone him!
The god of Moses is a poor general... to leave him no retreat.
Ten times you have seen the miracles of the Lord!
And still you have no faith!
He delivers you to death!
Stone him!
Stone him!
Listen to Moses!
He speaks God’ s will!
- They will stop for me!
- A chariot knows no rank.
Was it because there where no graves in Egypt that you took us to die in the wilderness?
Fear not!
Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord!
- A pillar of fire!
- The work of God!
Through it!
No, great one!
You cannot breach the fire of God!
Gather your families and flocks.
We must go with all speed.
Go where?
To drown in the sea?
How long can the fire hold?
After this day you shall see his chariots no more!
No!
You’ il be dead under them!
The Lord of Hosts will do battle for us!
Behold his mighty hand!
The wind opens the sea!
God opens the sea with the blast of his nostrils!
- Lead them through the waters.
- His will be done!
He opens the waters for them and he bars our way with fire.
Let us go.
Men cannot fight a god!
Better to die in battle with a god, than live in shame.
Praise God and down into it!
God has delivered us!
- Help us!
- Never mind the wheel!
Pull!
Pull for your lives!
ls your life worth so much?
Save the bread if you can!
Bring Caleb to help with the wagons!
Moses!
Stand on the rock where the people can see you and have hope!
Above us!
The fire dies!
Sound the pursuit!
Chariots, halt!
This is work for a butcher, not a Pharaoh.
Destroy them all.
But bring Moses to me alive.
Level spears!
Forward!
- Here!
Take him!
- Wait!
Wait!
Grandfather, look, the horses are coming!
The chariots!
Run!
Run!
Better to serve than to die here!
Who shall withstand the power of God?
Thou didst blow with thy winds and the sea covered them!
Who is like unto Thee, O Lord?
From everlasting to everlasting... Thou art God!
(All) The Lord is one!
The Lord is one!
Before you strike... show me his blood on your sword.
You couldn’ t even kill him.
His god... lS God.
’ And Moses led lsrael from the Red Sea ’ into the wilderness of Sinai. ’ And they camped before the holy mountain. ’ And when the people saw ’ that Moses delayed to come down out of the mountain, ’ they gathered together. ’
Could anyone live on that summit for 40 days and nights?
- Yes!
By the will of God!
- Who knows the will of God?
Do you?
Do l?
Or you, Sephora?
His grieving wife.
She came back to find her husband.
But even she cannot hope he lives!
Moses went up into the forbidden ground to receive God’ s law!
But he’ s not returned!
We share your pain.
We sympathise.
But will sympathy lead us to this land flowing with milk and honey?
(Man) Now we have no leader!
Moses WlLL return... AAH!
Would a God who’ s shown you such wonders
let Moses die before his work is done?
His mother!
So beautiful is the hope of a mother!
But there are other mothers among you!
What will become of your children?
- We must have faith!
- Faith in what?
Can you lead us to this land of promise?
- Do you know where it is?
- Across the wilderness!
- Then who is to lead us?
- YOU, Dathan!
Where could I bring you but Egypt?
- Where there is death?
- No!
Where there is food!
- Pharaoh would kill us.
- Not with a god of Egypt before us!
- Make one, Aaron.
- Aaron knows the art of the temple!
(Others implore)
He will not!
He would rather see our flesh rot in the wilderness.
You WlLL make a god for us!
A god of gold!
A golden calf!
Korah shall be the high priest!
Bring baskets!
Buckets!
Shawls!
Anything you have!
Take off your earrings, your bracelets, your necklaces...
Aaron will make us a golden calf!
- The gold we took from Egypt!
- There!
From the burning bush, O Lord, you charged me to bring the people to this holy mountain, to behold your glory and receive your law.
What have I left undone?
’ l am... ’ l am... ’ l am the Lord thy God. ’ Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
’ Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.
’ And they overlaid the image with pure gold. ’ And Aaron fashioned it and smoothed it with the hammer, ’ ready to be graven by cunning art and man’ s device. ’ And he fastened it with nails that it should not move. ’ And he that smote the anvil ’ did beat the molten gold into thin plates. ’ For they had gathered their treasure into the midst of the furnace, ’ and did blow the fire upon it to melt it. ’ And they adorned themselves in rich apparel and costly array, ’ veils of blue, purple and scarlet, and fine linen wrought in Egypt. ’ And the women tread grapes into new wine. ’ ’ Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.
’ Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
’ Honour thy father and thy mother.
’ Thou shalt not kill. ’
(Cheering) ’ And the people sinned a great sin, ’ for they had made them a god of gold. ’ And they bore him upon their shoulders and rejoiced, ’ saying, ’’ This be our god, O lsrael. ’’’
Are you mourners of Moses afraid to face the new god? ’ Then they were as children who have lost their faith. ’ They were perverse and crooked and rebellious against God.
They did eat the bread of wickedness, ’ and drank the wine of violence, ’ and did evil in the eyes of the Lord. ’ And the people cried, ’’’ The graven image hath brought us joy, ’’ ’ and they worshipped the golden calf and sacrificed unto it. ’
Here is your sacrifice!
’ Thou shalt not commit adultery.
’ Thou shalt not steal.
’ Thou shalt not bear false witness ’ against thy neighbour.
’ Thou shalt not covet anything that is thy neighbour’ s. ’
(Moses) Written with the finger of God.
’ Go!
Get thee down, ’ for thy people have corrupted themselves. ’
’ And the people rose up to play and did eat and drink. ’ They were as the children of fools ’ and cast off their clothes. ’ The wicked were like a troubled sea ’ whose waters cast up mire and dirt. ’ They sank from evil to evil and were viler than the earth. ’ And there was rioting and drunkenness, ’ for they had become servants of sin. ’ There was manifest all manner of ungodliness and works of the flesh. ’ Even adultery and lasciviousness, ’ uncleanness, idolatry and rioting, ’ vanity and wrath. ’ And they were filled with iniquity and vile affections. ’ And Aaron knew that he had brought them to shame. ’
Abiram!
Korah!
Even unto the horns of the altar!
The light of God shines from you, Moses.
Do not kneel to me, Joshua.
These tablets of stone...
The writing of God.
His Ten Commandments.
There is a noise of war in the camp.
It is not the noise of war.
It is the noise of song and revelry.
Moses!
Joshua!
Woe unto thee, oh lsrael.
You have sinned a great sin in the sight of God!
You are not worthy to receive these Ten Commandments.
Aaron!
We are gathered against you, Moses!
You take too much upon yourself!
We will not live by your commandments.
We are free!
There is no freedom without the law.
Whose law?
Yours?
Did you carve the tablets to become a prince over us?
Who is on the Lord’ s side...
let him come to me!
(Confused shouts)
- You have cursed us.
- These people made me.
He showed you no milk and honey!
I show you a god of gold!
Come with me!
Follow me!
Blasphemers! ldolaters!
For this you shall drink bitter waters!
God has set before you this day his laws of life and good and death and evil.
Those who will not live by the law... (Shouts of panic) shall die by the law!
’ And the Lord’ s anger was kindled against lsrael. ’ And to prove whether they would keep his commandments or no, ’ he made them wander in the wilderness 40 years, ’ until the generation that had done evil in the sight of the Lord ’ was consumed. ’ But Moses ’ eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. ’ And he went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountains, ’ and the Lord showed him all the land ’ that was beyond the river Jordan. ’
The Lord was angry with me because I disobeyed him by the waters of strife.
And he said unto me, ’’ Behold the new land with thine eyes. ’’ Thou shalt not cross over this river Jordan. ’’
Then I shall stay.
I am called by the Lord, Sephora.
I go alone.
Look, Moses.
The people have come to the river Jordan.
ln the Ark they carry the law you brought them.
You taught them not to live by bread alone.
You are God’ s torch, that lights the way to freedom.
I love you.
Joshua, I charge you and strengthen you, for you shall go over Jordan to lead the people.
As for me and my house, we shall serve the Lord.
Mered, give me the books.
Eleazar... set these five books in the Ark of the Covenant, by the tablets of the Ten Commandments, which the Lord restored unto us.
Go.
Proclaim liberty throughout all the lands, unto all the inhabitants thereof.
I will not go single, because créanlo or no, somebody invited to me.
- Skies!

- Then that I create.
Sight, is necessary to give value us and of doing it.
When we go to the room in pair.
- In agreement.
Thanks.
I feel it, I did not understand to you.
What I said was that it wanted to know if you would like to go to the dance with me.
Harry, pardon but another boy invited to me.
And...... because I accepted to go with him.
Well, there is no problem.
Good bye.
In truth, I feel it.
I pass what to you '?
- It is that it invited to Fleur Delacour.
- That '?
- That no, of course. - it said yes to You that - you are not idiot.
It was walking...... with which I like to see walk it.
And I could not avoid to ask to him.
In fact, you shouted it, and he was a little frightful. - and soon what you did?
Salíhuyendo.
- I am not done for that.
- Ahíestá.
Only I like to watch it.
Curse.
- My suit in full dress, so that '?
Because it shines brilliant.
Without embroiders nor ridiculous sleeves.
Traditional?
He is archaic.
I shine like my tia Tessy.
And I stink out like my tia Tessy.
It already leaves that moño peacefully.
Good looking to that he is single in its room crying.
Piénsalo.
Why not us it said with whom it would come?
Because we had not deceived of her.
Because nobody invited it.
I had invited it if it was not so proud.
Hello, boys.
Lights very...... elegant.
Ah, aquíestás, Potter.
- Ready so that '? - to dance.
It is the tradition that the 3 champions, in this case 4, they open the dance.

And you, Mr. Weasley, it happens to the Great Dining room with the Srta.
- Aquíestá.
- Yes, I know it.
Of course that no.

He is pelón odioso, no?
Now we know why it goes as much to the library.
- We will be able to dance?
- To dance, to run, to fly if you want.
Víctor was by ponche.
They want to come with us?
No, we do not want to go with you.
What is what it happens to you, Rum?
The enemy?
Who is the one that wanted its autograph?
In addition, the intention of Match is the cooperation...... international magician.
In order to make friends.
I believe that he tries more than a friendship.
No.
How it happens oneself to you?
In addition, I can be taken care of single.
It is greater than you.
That is what you create?
- Yes, that I create.
Which is?
In the next dance they ten the value of to invite to me before another one does it. - and not like your last resource.
- But if...
- Where you were?
It does not matter.
Already váyanse to the bed both.
They become odiosas with the age. - they always spoil everything.
You already know it.
Ah, if '...
The hour comes near.
You have changed, ColaGusano...... so that you salute like it is due to our guest.
I finish arriving.
You can believe it?
Harry, you said to me that you would decipher the key and you would know the answer. - and the test will be in two days.
- In serious?
Then I do not know it.
I suppose that Víctor already deciphered it.
Neither of that, nor of nothing.
To Víctor it likes plus the physicist.
I talk about to that he is not very expressive.
In fact, he is very tedious.
Síestás trying to decipher it, certain?
- What means that?
- It means that this is designed...... for probarte of the cruelest way.
You faced dragoon with much value.
Perhaps but it is not sufficient this time, Harry.
Hello, Potter.
How... cómo. estás?
Very well.
Listening, I believe that I was not thankful to you by to have warned to me of the dragoons.
You had fact the same by me.
Exact.
You know the bath perfect of the fifth floor?
It is not bad place to take a bath.
It takes your egg and...... everything with hot water meditates.
I must be very crazy.
In truth, I am very crazy.
Myrtle!

We have taken what you value more...... and to find you have it one hour.
Fantastic.
Cedric took hours in understanding it.
The bubbles of the water almost finished.
Where our voices, they sound, see look for to us.
The Black Lake, is obvious.
And to find you have it one hour.
Also it is obvious, and a the very problematic time.
Very problematic?
When it was the last time that you held the breathing under the water by 1 hour?
It listens, Harry.
There is a solution, we will find it together.
Moan to interrupt...... but professor McGonagall she wants to see them in his office.

But he is that... professor, second test is only in hours...
Potter already must to be prepared well.

You were of more aid than Ronny.
You see yourself very nervous, Harry.

Only one hour!
Later they will be single, and no magic will save them.
The test will begin to the sonar the tube.

Although, the continuous life...... and it is necessary to follow ahead.
Barty.
You will not try to convince it so that work in the Ministry, right?.
The last boy who he worked there, disappeared.
And I am the crazy person!
Still memory the first time that I saw.

At moments thus, the Magical world he hopes that their leaders are strong.
- Then then, demuéstralo. - the Match is not going away to cancel.
I will not stay as a cowardly one.
A true leader does the correct thing without concerning nothing.
- What you said?
What you meant to me?
- They excuse, horsemen.
I inform to them into which this conversation no longer is private.
Harry, what just verte here.
- No, it is not necessary.
The Minister and I already went away.
I return in a while.
Minister, after you.

Although I warn to you...... that pricks much.
Professor...
Oh, what taste to see it.
lgor Karkaroff solicitd to leave Azkaban in order to present/ display tests to this Advice.
If its testimony turns out to be from aid...... the Council is prepared in order to order its immediate liberation.
He accepts these conditions?
- Yes, Sir.

I have names, gentleman.
It was Rossia.
Evan Rossia.

Yes, yes.
The same one.
It gave information already knows who on
Very well, the Council will deliberate.
- Meanwhile he will return to Azkaban.
Hope, hopes.
There are more names.
Severus Snape.
The Council is conscious of the evidence that it provides'...... demonstrating that Severus Snape was a Mortifago...... but that before Lord Voldemort...... one became ours spy in spite of the risk...
It is lie! - and it no longer is Mortifago.
Since the witness did not provide excellent information...... this session is closed.
- I know more of somebody.
Its name.
- It continues.
- This person participated in the capture...... and by means of curse, I torture '...... to Longbottom and its wife. - the name, déme the damn name.
- Barty Crouch...... junior.
Quítenme its revolting hands of above.
You are not my son.
But you must be cautious.
It is a pensadero? very useful if like I...... you have much information in the mind.
It allows me to examine things of the past.
But I have been treating to find something...... a small detail...... something that perhaps omiti.
Something that explains why these terrible things are happening.
But whenever I want to find it...... one becomes to me to escape.
Sir?
To Barty Crouch Junior...
- What was what him step '? - they sent It to Azkaban.
That to Barty destroyed it.
But it did not have option, it demonstrates was forceful.
It is that......
I dreamed about Barty.
It was in the summer, before to return to the school.
In the dream, I was in a house...... and Voldemort was there.
But... it did not seem human.
And also it was ColaGusano and Barty Junior.
It has happened other times?
Yes, and always it is the same dream.
Sir, those dreams... what I see.
In fact they are not happening, right?.
I believe that you would not have to think in those dreams, Harry.
The best thing is than simply...
... you eliminate them.
Why as much haste?
What great performance.
He was inspirador what did in the test.
It used branqui- seaweed?
Yes, Sir.
The branqui- seaweed is quite rare.
A plant difficult to find.
lgual that this.
Bubbles, quiza '?
Potion of the truth.
A little and you know who he would reveal his darker secrets.
Used in a student this'...... lamentably prohibited, but...... if he returns to rob something to me of here he can that appears a little...... in its juice of pumpkin.
- I have not robbed anything. - it does not try to deceive to me.
The branqui- seaweed is inoffensive, but serpent skin...... herbórea African.
You and their friends are preparing a potion multi- game, and créame......
I will find out why.
Today in the morning...... professor Moody placed the Glass of the Three Magicians in the labyrinth.
Only he knows his exact position.
It is hour of the first position, they will be first in beginning.
Delacour.
First that touches the Glass...... he will be the winner.
The professors will review the perimeter.
If a champion wishes to retire before finishing...... he only must send red sparks with its varita.
Express.
In the labyrinth, it will not have dragoons nor creatures you vitiate.
Ahíenfrentarán something much more challenging.
The people, being there inside they become.
If they can, they look for the Glass, but they are cautious...... or they could lose the reason in the passage.
Champions, prepárense.
- Cuídate.
One...
Fleur?
- Down!
- Yes.
He is enough. - he is enchanted.
- Déjame peacefully.
It is enchanted.
Yes.
Harry!
Harry!
- Olvídalo.
It hears, for a moment creíque...... you were not going to help me.
Yes, also I.
It hears, Potter, it is difficult, eh?
Yes, much.
It runs!
- Sálvate.
Together.
One, two, three.
- Yes.
And your '?
Where we are?
It already had been here.
It is a traslador.
- the Glass is a traslador.
Aqui '!
Cedric!
- Now!
- Harry, of what you speak?
- What happens? - the Glass Takes.
- Who is and what it is what wants?
- Bush to the intruder.
No!
Cedric!
Hazlo, now.
The bone of the father...... taken without permission.
The meat...... of the crew member...... given voluntarily...
The blood of the enemy...
... taken by the force...
... it will revive Mr. Tenebroso.
ColaGusano, my varita.
- Master.
Thanks.
No!
The other arm.
Welcome, friends.
They have spent 13 years, and now if '...... aquíestán, in front of me.
The truth, I feel very...... disappointed.
No tried to find me.
Not even your '...
Lucius.
My Lord, if there were detected a signal...
- It had signals, my evasive friend. - and more than one it crushes.
- I assure to Him, my Lord...... that I never have resigned to the Tenebrous Magic.
This face, that I have been myself forced to show from its absence...... it is my true mask.
I sílo helped.
Only by fear.
Not by truth.
But now if '...... me you have been useful last ColaGusano months.
Thanks.
- Era a good looking boy. - it does not touch it!
Harry!
Nearly, forgetfulness that you were ahi '...... stopped on the bones of my father.
Yes, it would present/ display to you...... but I know that lately already you are almost as famous as I.
The boy who survived.
What great lie is your legend, Harry.
You want that it gives him what it spent that night 13 years ago?
You want that it discloses how perdíen reality my powers?
It was the love.
They will see, when the dear Lily Potter it gave its life by its only son...... it provided the Maxima to him protection.
I could not touch it.
It was old magic...... to debísaber it.
But it does not matter, does not matter.
The things have changed.
Now I can...... tocarte.
It is surprising what can to do a little of your blood.
Tomala, Potter.
Tómala, tómala!
First, a reverence, please.
The courtesy is very important.
To Dumbledore it would not like that you forgot your modales.
I said: reverence.
That is better.
And now...... this.
Very well, Harry.
Your parents would be very proud.
Coverall your despicable mother.
I go to matarte, Harry Potter.
- No.
From today, nobody it will never return to question...... my powers.
As of today, if they speak of you they will speak only of how me suplicaste...... to die.
And I, as I am very pious......
Levántate!
You do not return to give the back me!
I want that you watch to me when it kills to you!
And I want to see when light escapes of your eyes!
As you want.
Quiet!
I myself I will end him.
Harry...... when the connection is broken, you must run towards the traslador.
But only for a moment, you understood?
Harry, llévalo to my body, please.
And llévaselo to my father.
Suéltala, you are ready.
Suéltala!
No!
We did it!
Harry!
No!
- By God, they have returned?
What happens? - it has returned.
It has returned.
Voldemort has returned.
Cedric requested to me that it brought his body.
It could not leave it.
Not there.
Calm, Harry.
He already happened.
He is here.
- That remains in their seats. - the boy is dead.
- We must retire the body of here.
There is much people.
Déjenme to happen.
Déjenme to happen.
Son.
He is my boy!
He is my son!
Calm.
They see.
You are with me.
Calm.
Cálmate.
You are well, Potter?
It hurts the wound to you?
Now not much.
Déjame to see it, Harry.
The Glass was a traslador.
Somebody enchanted it.
And it dresses... -... how it was?
Mr. Tenebroso.
What in front of feels when being him?
I do not know it.
It was like living one on my dreams.
One of my nightmares.
There were others?
- In the cemetery, there were others?
I have not said anything on a cemetery.
Wonderful creatures they are those dragoons.
Think that that miserable one had to you noticed if I had not been suggested it?
Think that Cedric Diggory would have said to you...... that you opened the egg in the water if I had not been insinuated it?
Think that Neville Longbottom you it would have mentioned the braqui- seaweed...... if I did not have to him given the suitable book?
Then you were...... who put my name in the Fire Chalice...... and he enchanted to Krum, but...
You won because me I proposed it.
You finished in the cemetery because asíestaba glided.
And the objective was obtained.
The blood that runs by these veins...... also it runs in those of him.
lmagina how it compensated to me '...... when it knows...... that once and for all...... destruíal great Harry Potter.
You know who I am?
- Albus Dumbledore.
- Alastor Moody. - you are It?
- No.
He is aqui '?
In this quarter?
Harry, aléjate of there.
- You are well, Alastor?
- I feel It, Albus.
It is Moody, but who is...
Potion multi- juice.
Now we know who it has to you been robbing.
It waits a little while.
Barty Crouch Junior.
I will teach mine to you, if you teach yours to me.
You are it...
You know what means, certain?
Your grandfathers.
Lord Voldemort has returned.
I feel it, Sir.
I could not avoid it.
Notify Azkaban...... that we found its prisoner.
They will receive to me just as to a hero.
Talvez, but I no I have time for heroes.
Today we felt...... a terrible loss.
Cedric Diggory was as they know...... an untiring worker.
And most important:
A faithful... faithful friend.
Therefore I believe that they have right to knowing how it died.
Yes.
... to Cedric Diggory I kill it '......
Lord Voldemort.
The magic minister no he wanted that one said them.
But not to do it I consider it an insult to its memory.
The intense pain...... which we felt before this loss, it remembers to me, remembers to us...... that although we come from different places and we spoke different languages...... our hearts bark as if they were one only.
Dices these events...... the friendship bows that we have formed east year...... they will be more important that never.
Remember this...... and Cedric Diggory it will not have died in vain.
Remember this...... and we will honor a boy who was...... just and honest.
Brave and faithful even the last moment.
I never liked these curtains.
When it was in 4 year I burned them.... by accident, clear.
I put to you in a great one east danger year, Harry.
I feel it.
Professor.
When he was in cemetery, had a little while...... in that the varita of Voldemort and mine because they were connected.
It dresses to your parents that night, certain?
They reappeared.
- No encantamiento...... it can wake up to deads, Harry.
I believe that you know it.
Difficult times and dark they wait to us.
Soon we will have to choose between which he is correct...... and what is easy.
Aquítienes friends.
You are not single.
Hermione...... this is for you.
Escríbeme, please.
Good bye.
Think that sometimes we will have a calm year in Hogwarts?
- No.
- No.
No, hopefully no.
Because... what would be the life without dragoons?
Everything will change now, no?
Yes.
Promise that they will write to me.
Please.
I no.
You know that I do not write.
- Harry, you will do it?
Previously on Prison Break:
What you' re doing up there in the infirmary, what it' s got to do with what we' re doing here?
Four days from now, on the night of the escape, we' il have 18 minutes to get the bars off the infirmary window, and for all seven of us to get across the wire and over the wall.
- Is that doable?
- Of course.
Baby, what the hell is going on?
Well, Hector says that you can serve your full sentence.
Where' s Maricruz?
She' s not gonna be coming around here anymore.
- This is a joke, right?
- She' s with me now.
I just need to know what Michael Scofield wanted from you in exchange for the green card.
Why would you need a credit card in prison?
I' d have gotten some crap job with the Feds.
Keep talking like that, I' m gonna be forced to put a bullet in your head.
I need to get out while I still got my life.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Things have changed.
What' s up?
We' ve got too many people.
I' ve done the math, and one of them has to go.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Oh, it' s, uh, not a problem.
Impressive resume.
- Thank you.
Tell me why you chose to pursue a career in engineering.
I' ve always been interested in, uh, structure, geometry.
How things fit together.
How an object that, uh, performs a function can... also be a work of art.
What about the future?
Where do you see yourself in five years?
One suit, black.
That baby boy all growed up yet?
Oh, he' s gonna raise hell the next few years.
Take after his mama.
Yeah, you know, it' s the same old same up here.
But, uh... things are getting pretty tense,
You know what I mean, Jimmy?
There' s a potential, uh, situation.
I found our access to the infirmary building, but I' m gonna need some time to make it work.
How much time?
Enough for me to find my way up a 20- foot vertical drain pipe without using a ladder.
I' il probably need to skip PI tomorrow if I want to get this thing done.
It ain' t class.
What if one of the bulls decide to drop in?
Well, I don' t have a choice, do I?
Once we get through the pipe below the guards' room, it will be a whole lot easier.
I can come and go without using the door, and with Westmoreland as a lookout, we' il have one more man available for dig.
Westmoreland' s gonna be a problem.
All seven of us can' t break over that wall in 18 minutes.
You said it yourself: it' s impossible.
Listen, man, I' m telling you, one of us has got to take a hike.
Mind if I share that with the rest of the class?
Figured out that we got too many clowns in the car.
So, one of us is in here digging, but his seat ain' t guaranteed.
How is this your problem, man?
He doesn' t know what he' s talking about.
I' m not gonna dig if I' m not gonna go.
We need to make a decision on who gets cut.
Well, I think we can all agree who that should be.
Oh, pardon me for interrupting.
But, uh... what' s that smell?
It smells a little like... conspiracy.
We need to get back to work.
Yeah, before you do, I have an announcement to make.
I' ve been growing leery of the way y' all talk, like I' m a lesser man.
So, I bought an insurance policy.
I called up my guy on the outside, and I told him about our plan.
And I told him, in all likelihood, I' il be seeing him next week, but... if he don' t hear from me five minutes before the escape, and 20 minutes after,
So if you all got ideas about getting rid of me...
I suggest you make other plans.
Son of a bitch has got a countermove for everything.
Not for this.
Odd men out -- me and you.
What do you mean?
Look who you' re walking with right now.
You should be up there, calling the shots with the rest of the suits.
- Yeah.
So?
Scofield is only here for one reason: his brother.
And he only needs two things: the old man' s money, and the mob boss' s plane.
He don' t need you.
You just happened to be in the same cell when he got here.
You and the toilet.
I' ve done a lot of work on this thing.
Exactly, and me, too.
Yeah, we' re just the damn laborers on this thing, man.
And the night that Fish goes into that hole, you think he wants to carry all that extra baggage?
'Cause that' s all we are.
I don' t know about you, but I' m going.
How much does he tell you, anyways?
Or does he keep it all to himself?
Yeah, he probably tells you, the less you know, the better, right?
He tells me everything.
If he tells you everything, then you don' t need him.
Now, we can go by ourselves, me and you.
Or, you know, you can wait and see if Scofield really wants to carry heavy weight.
It' s up to you, popi.
Yo, I still waitin '.
What for?
I swiped you that watch, man.
Where' s my Pl?
That' s not gonna happen.
You promised.
I said I' d think about it.
Maybe somewhere down the road.
Ain' t gonna hold my breath.
What do you want me to do?
Now!
No, no, no!
No, they see a bullet, they' re gonna call the cops.
We don' t have a choice, okay?
I' m not gonna let you die.
Find it, find it!
What?
The bullet -- just find it and dig it out.
- I can' t.
- Do it!
Where' s Scofield?
I just looked for you in your cell.
I couldn' t find your credit card, either.
You know the one I' m talking about.
The one your whore wife trunked in the other day.
She told me all about it.
Maybe whore' s too strong.
What do you call a girl who married a felon to get into the United States?
Why' d she have to come here for, anyway?
No strip clubs in Whazistan?
- Officer Bellick.
- Captain.
Fine.
Do you mind conducting your inquisitions on your own time, please?
I have a schedule to maintain.
Excuse me, Doctor.
I was just asking Mr.
Scofield about the contraband he had his stripper wife trunk in the other day.
Your job' s more important.
He' s had it out for me since the day I got here.
- Hold still, please.
I only married her... so she could get her green card.
I saw you coming out of the conjugal room.
That' s just business.
You don' t have to explain it to me, Michael.
I know.
But I want to.
Oh, is that who you is now?
I thought you was just a cowboy.
Take a couple of steps back, boy.
You know what I can' t understand is, why somebody like you wants to get out of here anyway.
How you going to survive, huh?
The world' s all different now.
It' s scary...
You wouldn' t know what to do.
I don' t have to justify myself to you.
Oh, you' re going to have to.
Them old bones just going to be dragging us down.
Maybe I' il just snap a few of 'em right now.
Hey, break it up down there!
I' m not going to warn you no more.
What' s up?
Records from the phone in the yard.
Lives down in Gary.
Yeah.
My guy' s going to lock him up in a moving van for a couple days until we' re in the clear.
- Moving van?
- Yeah.
Don' t worry, he can breathe and all.
We do it all the time.
What about T- Bag?
He' s no longer a threat.
Trust me.
You James Bagwell?
Got a delivery for you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Ma' am?
- Yes?
Can I speak with you, please?
You stay right here, okay?
Is he going to be okay?
He' s lost a lot of blood.
I was going to call the police, but I wanted to speak to you first.
His wound is obviously the product of a gunshot.
You need to be honest with me.
What was he doing when he got shot?
He was in the garage, underneath his car.
He' s in surgery right now.
The blood loss has caused his muscle tissue to suffer from a lack of oxygen.
He' s also sustained a fair amount of damage to his shoulder, and with a bullet there' s always an increased risk of infection.
So, he' s going to have to be admitted.
Is there anyone you should call?
Any family?
It' s just me.
I' il let you know as soon as he' s in recovery.
Thank you.
Yeah.
- Are you there yet?
- Almost.
You remember, be patient.
Follow his lead.
We want the trifecta today.
Yeah, I' m on it.
It' s me.
Yeah.
Yeah, like what?
The job you ordered went bad.
The guy was a paranoid, he had a gun... one thing led to another.
What, he' s dead?
Yeah.
And, unfortunately... there was a kid there.
What are you...
What are you talking about?
You killed a kid?
It was unintentional.
- It' s a kid, man.
- I know, I' m sorry.
SOB used him as a shield.
- A boy or a girl?
Boy.
- How old?
- Four, maybe five.
- Who' s here to see me?
- Hell if I know.
Some lady.
Baby.
Hi.
You look so beautiful.
I came here cause I have to tell you something.
What?
I' m pregnant, Fernando.
Pregnant?
With your baby.
I' m going to have your son.
You... you' re going to...
We...
We' re going to have a baby?
Oh, yeah, Papi, you hear that?
- I' m not finished!
- What, Mami, what?
Okay, Hector... he asked me to marry him.
What?
- Look, it' s crazy, I know.
- Well, tell him no.
Tell him you' re having my son.
We' re going to be a family.
Fernando...
Look, my mom, she says... that having a baby is the hardest job in the whole world.
And it' s even harder if I do this by myself.
But all I know is is I' m really scared.
I' m really scared to do this alone.
You' re not going to have to.
Well, I haven' t told him no yet.
Wait, wait.
You' re not actually considering this.
I don' t know.
I don' t know.
Oh, my God, baby, you got to stop listening to these people.
They' re poisoning your brain.
Your hormone things -- they' re out of whack.
This is our child we' re talking about.
I want you to listen to me.
I want you to wait.
Sooner than you think.
You keep on telling me that.
All right, visiting time is up.
Let' s go.
Tell me you' re going to wait.
Hands off, Sucre!
Please.
I love you.
But you' il learn to love again, right?
Tell me you' re going to tell him no, honey.
I don' t know.
I don' t know anything any more.
Sucre.
Come on.
- The kid' s here.
- Perfect.
Follow him back to the lawyers and call me back.
Where are you going?
I' il be back in ten minutes.
What do you have to do?
I can' t explain.
But if it works... you' il see soon enough.
I want to go with you.
I want to see now.
Someone has to stay here.
I need a lookout.
I' m always on lookout.
You' re my cellmate.
Who else is going to do it?
I' il be back in ten minutes, okay?
Okay.
Where do you want him?
John?
Where do you want T- Bag: in the shop or the shed?
Shh...
I don' t care.
You decide.
Thank God.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I' m okay.
She didn' t do anything.
I know.
- Here you go, man.
- Yeah, yeah.
These were seriously hard to get.
- What you need them for anyway?
- None of your business.
Thank you for waiting, Theodore.
I don' t mean to deny your time in the yard.
What' s this all about?
I' m afraid I have some terrible news.
You cousin James was shot and killed in his home yesterday.
His son, James Junior was killed, as well.
I' m very, very sorry.
What does it mean?
Am I chosen?
Or what?
Often, the Lord appears when you' re in particular need of forgiveness.
Maybe that' s what' s happening right now.
John, it' s never too late.
If you agree to accept Christ into your heart and turn from your sin, he will forgive you and save you in eternity.
Do you agree?
Verse 20:
Jesus said, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
I will come into him. "
He got to the infirmary building last night.
Through the old sewer pipe.
It' s the same pipe that runs under the guards' room.
That' s all I know.
That' s the little thumb- sucker that swiped my watch.
Who?
Tweener?
Solid gold.
Took it right off my arm.
It was a half hour before I even noticed it.
Whose was it in the first place?
You can tell me.
Michael Scofield.
What are you looking at?
I' il be right around the corner.
Westmoreland!
You scared me, boss.
Get back to work.
All right, let' s go!
Move it, Scofield.
He shall hear my voice.
He shall hear my voice.
He shall hear my voice.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Well, keep an eye on the tier for me, will you?
When are we getting out of here exactly?
I need to know the time.
As soon as possible.
"As soon as possible" is not a specific time.
- You tell Abruzzi the time?
- Yes, because he needs to know.
Why does he need to know and I don' t?
Because he' s arranging the plane.
Why the sudden curiosity?
Why would you want to be responsible for potentially dangerous information?
The less you know, the better.
It' s for your own good.
I have to go.
I' il meet you in Pl.
Stealing from a guard.
You can get thrown in the SHU for that, maybe even add a few years to your bid.
I don' t know...
Don' t deny it.
I already know it' s true.
Lucky for you, I got pull some around here.
I can make this sort of thing go away, like it never even happened.
Mmm.
That' s good.
Now...
I' m sure you' ve heard the word "rat."
I don' t like it.
"Snitch," neither.
Those sort of words aren' t appropriate for what I need from you.
What I need is a little information.
Like when you' re hanging out with Scofield...... just come back and tell me what he said.
I got an extra burger.
But, man, I' m full.
What do you say, kiddo?
You want a cheeseburger... or do you want to go to the SHU?
That' s my boy.
Hey, honey, what are you doing here?
I thought you left.
What' s wrong?
I, um...
I' ve been thinking.
I think we need to make a change.
What are you talking about?
Remember when we first got married, and we thought about moving out west?
Yeah, we were 22.
Well, maybe we should give it a shot.
It' s not too late.
I don' t understand.
What brought this on?
It' s just work.
I' m tired of being on the road and working for somebody else, while you sit at home all alone, night after night.
I want our lives to be about us.
I do, too, but there' s so much to think about, like the kids and the house.
We got to go.
You' re in trouble, aren' t you?
The crowd has thinned out in here.
How you doing, Sucre?
Switch me out.
Michael' s gonna be coming back this way.
- Hello?
- Veronica Donovan?
Who is this?
It, it doesn' t matter who I am.
Don' t hang up.
I have information that you may be interested in -- information that will lead to the exoneration of Lincoln Burrows.
What?
What is it?
Meet me tonight at the Highland Cafe on Kennedy Avenue.
I will tell you everything you need to know.
Highland Cafe, 8: 00 p. m.
All right, that' s enough.
- You sure?
Get out of here.
You don' t have to do this.
You don' t have to do this.
You don' t have to do this.
You brought it on yourself.
I' m just an emissary for all the pain and suffering you caused, all the families you ruined, all the kids.
What about Jimmy?
He had nothing to do with this.
You didn' t need to kill him.
He had his whole life in front of him.
You didn' t need to kill a beautiful child.
After all I' ve done, maybe I do deserve to die, maybe I do.
But you are no better than me.
But I can be, if I want.
God has given me the chance to choose.
Maybe I should give you a chance as well.
Yes, anything, anything, please.
Back out.
Of the escape?
Or die.
I wouldn' t make it out there, anyway -- not with my proclivities.
I want you to give me your word.
You hear me?
I want you to give me your word!
Yeah, you got it, John.
- Please.
- Swear.
I swear to God!
All right!
I have forgiven you.
You just have to pray that the Lord Jesus Christ will do the same.
Hey, John, you know, actually, about Jesus...
Say hi to Him for me, will you?
I' m through.
- Keep it up.
Bulls.
We' re not ready.
Hey, boss.
What you doing out here, Linc?
Taking a break.
Got to check the status in there.
It' s all good.
Then you won' t mind me checking it out.
Hey.
What the hell' s your problem, con?
Step off or you' re going to the SHU!
Thanks.
Well... we leave tonight.
Where' s my brother?
Michael, we got a big problem.
RaceMan
KRALER:
Mr. Frank.
Kraler.
Mr. Kraler.
My good friends.
It is so good to see you home.
We had heard nothing.
I' m alone.
You must come home with us...... and rest now.
- You must stay with us.
No, I can' t stay in Amsterdam.
Mr. Frank, this is your home.
- It has too many memories.
Everywhere there' s something, Miep.
Even seeing you and Mr. Kraler....
I shouldn' t talk to you like this, after all you did.
Why, we' d do it again.
Everything' s gone.
The book....
They took everything, except some papers.
We saved your letters and papers.
Please burn them.
Burn everything.
I told her...... if I got back here, I' d find her book.
Anne' s diary?
It' s where she left it.
"The 9th of July, 1 942." 1 942.
Is it possible, Miep?
Only three years ago?
"Dear Diary, since you and I are to be great friends...... I will start by telling you all about myself.
My name is Anne Frank.
I am 1 3 years old.
I was born in Germany, but since my family is Jewish...... we emigrated to Holland when Hitler came to power.
Things went well for us until the war came and the German occupation.
Then things got very bad for the Jews. "
ANNE:
We had to wear yellow stars.
I couldn 't go to a Dutch school anymore.
And a million other things.
But somehow, we children still managed to have fun.
This morning, Father woke me at 5: 00...... and told me to hurry and get dressed.
We were going into hiding.
I was to put on as many clothes as I could.
It would look too suspicious if we walked along carrying suitcases.
We were going to disappear...... vanish into thin air.
I' m living a great adventure.
Three other people were coming in with us.
We had never met them.
- Something' s happened.
PETER:
VAN DAAN:
- Mother.
We' re here.
VAN DAAN:
- Mrs. Van Daan.
Peter.
Did you introduce yourself?
Margot.
Oh, and this is our son, Peter.
So, now, please let us take off some of these clothes.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Kraler.
FRANK:
You' re all here.
- Please, don' t even think of it.
- Brought sandwiches for lunch.
The canned goods are here, and your beans and potatoes.
- I' il get you ration books this afternoon.
If they see our names on ration books, they' il know we' re here.
It won' t be your names that' il be on them.
You must never touch a curtain.
No one must ever touch a curtain, day or night.
If someone on the streets should look up or someone should see...... we would be lost.
Remember, it' s not only our lives at stake...... but Miep' s and Mr. Kraler' s.
Thank you.
Miep or I will be up each day to bring you food and news.
How can we thank you?
I never thought I' d live to see the day when a man like Mr. Frank...... would have to go into hiding.
Goodbye.
Thank you, Mr. Kraler.
EDlTH:
- It' s all right, I have on three more.
- What do they mean, "1 3 minutes"?
- Before workmen come.
Now...... while the men are in the building below, we must be quiet.
Every sound can be heard down there, in the offices and in the workrooms too.
They leave at about 5: 30.
So to be perfectly safe, from 8 a. m. until 6 p. m...... we must move about up here only when absolutely necessary...... and then in stockinged feet.
The pipes go down through the workrooms.
No trash must ever be --
Not even a potato peeling.
We must burn everything in the stove at night.
Until it is over.
We can talk and laugh...... have our supper, read, play games, just as we would at home.
Now it would be wise if we all went to our rooms...... and were settled before 8: 00.
I regret there' s no place up there for Peter.
But he' il be here, near us.
- And where am l?
- You and Margot will be in there.
Excuse me, Mr. Frank.
Yes?
FRANK:
You take the upstairs.
It' s the best arrangement.
The only arrangement.
You must have some rest, dear.
Now, go in the girls' room.
- I feel fine.
I' m going to help Father.
Mr. Frank?
FRANK:
ANNE:
Go ahead, but be quick.
- He couldn' t live without that cat.
I didn' t know you had a cat.
I love cats.
- Mouschi.
Mouschi.
It doesn' t like strangers.
- ls he fixed?
You ought to have him fixed, to keep him from fighting.
ANNE:
- Jewish Secondary.
- Yeah, I know.
- I' ve never seen you around.
- You did?
Why didn' t you ever come over?
I' m sort of a lone wolf.
You can' t be a lone wolf here.
I wonder what our friends will say when we don' t show up today.
Do you know Sanne de Vries?
Sanne' s my best friend.
They always yell at us:
"Anne and Sanne, the skinny bananas."
That' s right.
They' il arrest you if you go out without your star.
[PETRONELLA GRUNTS]
- Help me.
- I' m helping.
- What are you going to do with it?
It' s funny, I don' t think I could burn mine.
- I don' t know why.
Something they make you wear so they can kick you around.
I know.
But after all...... it is the Star of David, isn' t it?
Annele, it' s almost 8: 00.
It' il be a long day.
This is fine.
You won' t forget to take off your shoes, will you?
Peter...... it' s nice to have you with us.
See you later.
Did you know that he went to the same school that --?
It' s comforting that Mr. Kraler and his secretary...... are down there below us, in the office.
Our protectors, we call them.
I asked Father what would happen to them...... if anyone found out they were hiding us.
Father said they would suffer the same fate that we would.
We are over an old spice factory.
You can smell the spices all through the building.
I read A Tale of Two Cities through in that first day.
"It is a far, far better thing I do...... than I have ever done.
It is a far, far better rest that I go to...... than I have ever known.
The end. "
It was the saddest book I ever read.
It is us, Miep and Kraler.
- This is the box you asked for.
- Thanks.
Oh, my dear friends, you were all so quiet up here.
Can you imagine me?
Wish they could hear that at school.
Please, quiet.
- What are these?
- You don' t have to whisper now.
- He' s such a nice cat.
Will you open it, please?
Know how I' m going to think of it here?
As a boarding house, a very peculiar boarding house.
Father, my film stars!
I was wondering where they were.
How wonderful.
There' s something more.
Go on, look further.
A diary.
And I' ve always wanted one.
I' m going downstairs to get a pencil.
- Anne, no!
- There' s nobody down there.
Don' t go beyond that door.
- Never?
I' m sorry, Anne, it isn' t safe.
It' il be hard, I know that.
As a matter of fact, just between us, Annele...... being here has certain advantages.
You said you' d rather die than wear overshoes.
In the end, you had to wear them.
Isn' t that good?
And the piano.
You won' t have to practice it.
I tell you...... this is going to be a fine life for you.
It' s an odd idea for someone like me to keep a diary.
Not only because I have never done so before...... but because it seems to me, neither I, nor for that matter anyone else...... will be interested in the unbosomings of a 13- year- old schoolgirl.
Still, what does that matter?
I want to write, but more than that...... I want to bring out all kinds of things...... that lie buried deep in my heart.
First of all, I expect I should be describing...... what it' s like to go into hiding.
But I don 't really know yet myself.
I only know it' s funny never to be able to go outdoors.
Never to run and shout and jump.
Wednesday, the 23rd of September, 1942.
The news of the war is good.
Stalingrad is still holding out.
The Russian offensive continues in the Moscow area.
- Whee!
- l 'm first for the W. C.
- Six o' clock, Margot.
- Where are my shoes?
- What shoes?
- I am?
- Wait till I get you.
Peter!
Peter, where are you going?
- Peter!
Annie, dear...... you shouldn' t play like that with Pete.
I don' t wanna be dignified!
You complain I don' t treat you like a grownup, but when I do, you resent it.
I only want some fun.
I don' t know what' s the matter with that boy.
He isn' t used to girls.
Isn' t two months time?
I could cry.
She' s usually so prompt.
- I' ve got more work to do, Anne.
You know, we' re going to forget how to dance.
When we get out, we won' t remember a thing.
- Where is Peter?
With his cat.
He hasn' t finished his lessons, has he?
- Peter!
- What is it?
Your mother says to come out.
I' m giving Mouschi his dinner.
You know what your father says about wasting time with that cat.
- I' m only telling you.
I' il feed him.
And I mean out.
Is that any way for you to talk to your little girlfriend?
Mother, I asked you...
- He' s blushing.
- Please, I' m not, but --
- Leave me alone.
Nothing to be ashamed of to have a girlfriend.
So what?
It' s just perfect.
Your father' s 1 0 years older than me.
Mr. Frank, I warn you...... if this war lasts much longer, we' re gonna be related.
- I haven' t seen my cat since lunch.
I' m giving Mouschi his dinner.
My little Mouschi.
I couldn' t live without my precious Mouschi.
You wonderful cat, you.
All right, Miss Quack- Quack.
- You!
You' re the most intolerable boy I ever met!
Anne, dear, you' re hot.
- Mother, please.
- You don' t have a fever, do you?
You know we can' t call a doctor here, ever.
Prevent an illness before it comes.
Let me see your tongue.
- Mother, this is perfectly absurd.
- Anne, dear, don' t be such a baby.
Let me see your tongue.
Otto.
Anne, you hear your mother, don' t you?
You' re all right.
I think there' s nothing the matter with our Anne that a ride on her bike...... or a visit with her friend Sanne de Vries wouldn' t cure.
Then I' d have someone to talk to.
With all the boys in the world...... why did I have to get locked up with him?
Is it someone?
- ls it Miep?
It' s strange we don' t hear.
- She' il come.
I wish she' d get here.
I' m going crazy without cigarettes.
-... and "very good" in Latin.
Well, I have a confession to make.
Today, you caught up with me.
We' il leave it to Margot to correct.
- lsn' t algebra vile, Father?
- Excellent, of course.
Anne, please.
Your French composition today, Margot, was just wonderful.
- Mrs. Van Daan, may I try it on?
- No, Annie.
It' s all right, really.
But please be careful with it.
My father gave me this coat the year before he died.
He always bought me the best money could buy.
Annie, that' s a personal question.
It' s not courteous to ask personal questions.
I don' t mind.
Anneke, our house was always swarming with boys.
- When I was a young girl -- - Oh, no, not again.
Shut up!
One summer, we had a big house in Hilversum.
The boys....
The boys would come buzzing around like bees around a jam pot.
When I was 1 7....
Well, we were wearing short skirts then, and I had such good- looking legs.
I may not be as pretty as I used to be...... but I still have my legs.
How about it, Mr. Frank?
All right, all right.
I' m not asking you, I' m asking Mr. Frank.
- Mother, for heaven sakes.
- Oh, I embarrass you too, do l?
I only hope the girl you marry has as good.
Anneke, my father used to worry with all the boys hanging around.
"lf any of those boys get fresh, you just say to him:
'Remember, Mr. So- and- So, remember, I am a lady.' "
Look at you, talking that way with her.
So what if she does?
Haven' t you finished?
VAN DAAN:
A hopeless case.
It' s just you haven' t got anyone to help you...... Iike Father helps Anne and me.
But if l -- Well, if we could help....
What about it, Peter?
Shall we make our school coeducational?
Thanks, yes.
Yes?
Why didn' t I meet you before I met that one there?
Excuse me.
Peter, you listen to Mr. Frank.
Mr. Frank is a highly educated man.
It' s after 8: 00.
- At least one of them should' ve come.
- They' il come.
Don' t worry.
I know something' s wrong.
Isn' t it bad enough here without you sprawling all over?
- Am I smoking?
- You already smoked all the cigarettes.
- Miep only brought me one package.
VAN DAAN:
You' re smoking up all our money.
Will you shut up?!
And what are you staring at?
I thought only children quarreled.
This isn' t a quarrel, it' s a discussion.
- I, rude?
- You' ve been spoiled.
Remember, Mr. So- and- So, I am a lady.
You' re the most aggravating -- Why aren' t you nice and quiet...... Iike your sister, Margot?
Why do you show off all the time?
Men don' t like that in a girl.
A girl who cooks and sews and cleans.
I' d open my veins.
-... to study music and art.
I' m going to be an actress or a writer or a dancer.
You clumsy little fool!
All ruined, and what do you care?
I could just kill you!
Anne, you must not behave in that way.
Anyone can have an accident.
I mean the answering back.
You must not answer back.
They' re our guests.
You don' t hear Margot getting into arguments with them.
Try to be like Margot.
No, thanks.
I don' t know what happens to you, Annie.
If I had ever talked to my mother as you talk to me....
People aren' t like that anymore.
"Yes, Mother.
Anything you say, Mother. "
I' ve got to fight things out for myself.
Make something of myself.
It isn' t necessary to fight to do it.
Margot doesn' t --
"Why aren' t you like Margot?"
Everything she does is right, and everything I do is wrong.
You' re all against me, and you worst of all.
I don' t know how we can go on living this way.
I can' t say a word to Annie, she flies at me.
In a half an hour, she' il be laughing and joking.
But no, no, he had to ask them.
MARGOT:
Father.
EDlTH:
Is it Miep?
- Miep' s here.
I can' t tell you how sorry I am about the coat.
Don' t worry.
Mr. Kraler.
When Mr. Kraler comes, the sun begins to shine.
He had to go into hiding in the country to escape a labor call- up...... but he has let me have the radio for you.
It gives us our eyes and ears out into the world.
The Axis forces in the Western....
And we listen to the BBC for hope.
MAN ON RADlO: -- ceaseless attacks by land and air forces are now in full retreat.
The 8th army continues to advance.
It' s good.
Now, let' s see what they have to say about the Nazis, huh?
Berlin.
Must we listen?
All right, Peter, that' s enough.
MlEP:
PETRONELLA:
KRALER:
- Y es, yes.
- It was a thief?
- He was right under you.
EDlTH:
We thought it was the police.
- You were, of course, quiet?
We didn' t move.
- That is good.
- Too close.
He went through everything, the desk and the files.
And he found the safe, but he could not get it open.
- They are in that safe.
They' il come back.
Get it out of here.
Yes, put a sign on the door:
- Jokes, yeah.
- Of course.
Burn it.
If the Green Police found that radio....
Then they' d find her diary.
Not my diary.
My diary goes, I go with it.
- Mr. Van Daan.
If they find us, they might as well find the diary, the radio....
- Usually, I try to bring good news.
But something has happened.
He told me that he has a Jewish friend, a dentist.
So I have come to you.
-... but could you take him in?
- Well, of course we will.
I think I know him.
- Thank you.
- There' s so little food as it is -- - We can stretch the food a little.
- No, thank you.
Margot will move in with us, and he can have her bed.
Mr. Dussel.
Don' t bump your head.
Come in, Mr. Dussel.
This is Mr. Frank.
- Yes.
Thank you, Mr. Frank.
I leave you in good hands.
Mr. Dussel, I must return your coat.
- What can I say to thank you?
- Mr. Kraler and Miep...... they' re our lifeline.
Without them, we couldn' t live.
You make us seem very heroic.
- We simply don' t like the Nazis.
"Nobody' s going to tell us Dutchmen what to do with our damn Jews."
Goodbye.
- Welcome, Mr. Dussel.
- Thank you.
Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan.
DUSSEL:
Please, Mr. Dussel, sit down.
I' m dreaming, I know it.
Mr. Otto Frank here.
You' re not in Switzerland, then?
Someone said that you had escaped.
- And you' ve been here all this time?
- Ever since July.
Did Mr. Kraler warn you you won' t get much to eat here?
Three ration cards among the seven of us.
DUSSEL:
Mr. Van Daan, you don' t realize what' s happening outside...... that you should warn me of a thing like that.
Every day, hundreds of Jews disappear.
They search house by house.
Every day, children come home from school to find their parents gone.
Hundreds are being deported.
People that you and I know: the Hallensteins, the Wessels.
DUSSEL:
"Come to the station on such and such a day and hour.
Bring only what you can carry. "
If you don' t, they come drag you from your home...... and ship you off to Mauthausen, the death camp.
We didn' t know that things had got so much worse.
Forgive me for speaking so.
They' re gone.
Sanne and I are in the same class.
Sanne is my best -- My best friend.
She returned home from school to find her parents gone.
She was alone for two days, and then they came and took her away.
Gone?
Oh, no.
People named Meyerberg, they lived near us.
- We should put this off.
I' m sure Mr. Dussel would like to get settled.
If you' il come with me, Mr. Dussel.
Forgive me if I haven' t expressed my gratitude.
This has been such a shock to me.
I always thought of myself as Dutch.
I was born in Holland.
And now, after all these years....
If you will excuse me.
It' s so different from what Mr. Kraler tells us.
Mr. Kraler says that things are improving.
I like it better the way Kraler tells it.
Good night.
- Say good night!
- Good night, Mother.
Do you have any children, Mr. Dussel?
No, I never married.
No one.
ANNE:
You must be terribly lonely.
I' m used to it.
I don' t think I could ever get used to it.
- A cat or a dog?
No, no, I have an allergy to furbearing animals.
- Oh, dear.
What?
- He has?
- Yes.
We hardly ever see it.
- Yeah.
- Well, I hope so.
Yes.
I hope I won' t be too much of a bother to you, Mr. Dussel.
No.
I seem to be able to get everyone' s back up.
Oh, I always get along very well with young people.
My patients all bring their children to me...... because they know I get along well with them.
So don' t you worry about that.
Thank you, Mr. Dussel.
Good night.
I' il be back.
Good night, Mr. Dussel.
Be careful.
Sanne?
Save me!
Don' t take me!
EDlTH:
It' s all right.
It' s all right.
Please, Mr. Dussel, turn on the light.
It was just a dream.
You' re here, safe, you see?
Yelling like that.
She' s endangering our lives.
Mr. Dussel, after all, Anne is not exactly a trained frontline soldier.
Please, Mr. Dussel, go back to bed.
She' il be herself in a minute or two, won' t you, Annie?
Hmph.
Excuse me.
I' m going to the W. C., the one room where there' s peace.
Would you like some water?
Was it a very bad dream?
Perhaps if you told me?
EDlTH:
Try to sleep, then.
- I' il sit right here beside you.
You don' t have to.
Very much, really.
I' d rather you didn' t.
Good night --
You' il be all right?
There' s nothing that you want?
Will you please ask Father to come?
Yes, of course, Anne, dear.
She asked for you.
- Edith....
She' s still trembling with fear.
She wants nothing of me.
She pulled away when I leaned down to kiss her.
MARGOT:
It' s just a phase.
They give all their love to their fathers.
You weren' t like this.
You didn' t shut me out.
- Do you want me to read to you?
- No, just sit with me for a minute.
- Do you think anyone outside heard me?
- No.
Now, lie down quietly so.
Now try to sleep.
I' m a terrible coward.
I' m so disappointed in myself.
I think I' m really grown- up...... and then something happens, and I run to you like a baby.
I love you, Father.
Annele.
It' s true.
You' re the only one I love.
I' ve been thinking about it for a long time.
It' s fine to have you tell me that you love me...... but I' d be much happier if you said that you loved your mother as well.
Your love.
We have nothing in common.
She doesn' t understand me.
Whenever I try to explain my views on life, she asks me if I' m constipated.
She' s crying.
She is in there crying.
Oh, Father, I was horrible, wasn' t l?
What' s the matter with me?
Help me.
There is so little that we parents can do to help our children, Annie.
We can only try to set a good example, point the way.
ANNlE:
Really, I am.
Every night, I think back over all the things I did that day that were wrong.
Like putting the wet mop in Mrs. Van Daan' s bed.
And now this with Mother.
I say to myself, "That was wrong."
Never.
I may do something worse, but I' il never do that again.
I have a nicer side, Father...... but I' m scared to show it.
I' m afraid people will laugh at me.
So the mean Anne comes to the outside...... and the good Anne stays in the inside.
And I keep on trying to switch them around...... have the good Anne outside...... and the bad Anne inside.
It would be what I' d like to be.
If only....
She' s asleep.
Thursday, the 29th of October, 1942.
Mr. Dussel and I had a great battle yesterday.
Yes, Mr. Dussel.
According to him, nothing, I repeat, nothing, is right about me.
While he was going on at me, I thought:
"Someday, I' m going to give you such a smack...... that you 'il fly right up to the ceiling."
Why is it that every grownup thinks he knows the way to bring up children?
Particularly the grownups that haven 't any.
Monday, the 9th of November, 1942.
Wonderful news!
That measure of....
Churchill spoke on the BBC from London.
Ah, this is not the end.
It is not even the beginning of the end.
No, but it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.
The air raids are getting worse.
The British planes come over, day and night, on their way to Germany.
It' s just too much.
What will we do?
We can' t go out in the street.
If they hit this house, your worries will be over.
That big explosion, an English plane fell right in this block!
Peter!
VAN DAAN:
Just look at them.
- The sooner we' il be home again.
- I don' t believe it' il ever be over.
A cup of tea.
Oh, yes, please.
- I don' t care.
Me too, please.
Tea now or tomorrow morning?
- Sure?
I' il take mine now.
The skylight!
FRANK:
"Praised be thou, Lord, ruler of the universe...... who' s sanctified us with thy commandments...... and bidden us kindle the Hannukah lights.
Praised be thou, O, Lord, our God, ruler of the universe...... who wrought wondrous deliverances for our fathers in days of old.
Praised be thou, O, Lord, our God, ruler of the universe...... that thou hast given us life and sustenance...... and brought us to this happy season. "Amen.
- Amen.
Monday, the 7th of December, 1942.
The Hannukah holiday came early this year.
"We kindle this Hannukah light...... to celebrate the wonderful deeds wrought through the zeal...... with which God filled the hearts of the heroic Maccabees 2000 years ago.
They fought against indifference...... against tyranny and oppression, and they restored our temple to us.
- Amen.
"I lift up mine eyes unto the mountains from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
He that keepeth thee will not slumber.
He that keepeth lsrael doth neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.
He shall keep thy soul.
The Lord shall guard thy going out and thy coming in...... from this time forth and forevermore. "Amen.
- Amen.
Thank you.
- It isn' t over yet.
Where are you going?
- Presents?
Not this year, unfortunately.
Everyone.
St. Nicholas Day.
No, not like St. Nicholas Day.
I remember particularly the candles.
The next night, three, and so on, until eight candles are burning.
When there are eight candles, it' s truly beautiful.
Each day, they got better and better.
That' s present enough.
I' ve got something.
Every second bastard born is fathered by a priest.
But in Utopia that couldn' t be.
For why?
- For there the priests are very holy.
- Therefore very few.
Is it anything interesting, Matthew?
I don' t know.
- Bless you too, Matthew.
To be sure, we have some holy priests in England.
- Oh, name some.
- Brother James.
Man' s a simpleton.
It' s from Cardinal Wolsey.
What' s he want?
- Me.
- When?
Now.
In Hampton Court?
You won' t be there by midnight.
- The King' s business.
- Queen' s business.
Mistress Anne Boleyn' s business.
Well, it' s all the Cardinal' s business.
That' s very true.
And when the Cardinal calls, you all come running, day or night.
What is the man?
A butcher' s son.
Chancellor of England, too.
No, that' s his office.
What' s the man?
Surely, Your Grace, when a man rises so high and so swiftly...... we must think he was misplaced in his origins.
That, at least, was the opinion of Aristotle and....
A butcher' s son and looks it.
His looks, yes, I give you his looks.
What was that you said, Richard?
Nothing, Sir Thomas, it was out of place.
And Wolsey' s still a butcher.
And you' re a member of the King' s High Council, not an errand boy.
That is why I must go.
The Duke would go if the Cardinal called him.
I might.
I' il be back for breakfast.
Go to bed.
"Dear Lord, give us rest tonight, or if we must be wakeful, cheerful.
"Careful only for our soul' s salvation.
For Christ' s sake.
Amen. "
And bless our lord, the King.
- "And bless our lord, the King."
- Amen!
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Goodnight, Your Grace.
Keep clear of Wolsey, Thomas.
He' s a frightened man.
- Who is that?
- A young friend from Cambridge.
- What' s he want?
- What do they all want?
A position.
- Can you give him a position?
- Do you recommend him?
No.
- Sir Thomas.
- No.
- Did you recommend me?
- No.
Richard, I may have a position for you.
- What?
What position?
- Not now, Richard.
Tomorrow.
For you all, boatman.
Thank you, sir.
Sir Thomas is here, Your Grace.
Sir Thomas.
Master Cromwell.
You opposed me in the Council this morning, Thomas.
Yes, Your Grace.
- You were the only one.
- Yes, Your Grace.
You' re a fool.
Thank God there is only one fool on the Council.
Why did you oppose me?
I thought Your Grace was wrong.
A matter of conscience.
You' re a constant regret to me, Thomas.
If you could just see facts flat on...... without that horrible moral squint.
With a little common sense, you could have made a statesman.
The King.
Where' s he been?
Do you know?
I, Your Grace?
Spare me your discretion.
He' s been to play in the muck again.
He' s been to Mistress Anne Boleyn.
More, are you going to help me?
If Your Grace will be specific.
You' re a plodder!
All right, we' il plod.
The King wants a son.
What are you going to do about it?
I' m very sure the King needs no advice from me on what to do about it.
Thomas, we' re alone.
I give you my word, there' s no one here.
I didn' t suppose there was, Your Grace.
Do you favour a change of dynasty?
Do you think two Tudors are sufficient?
For God' s sake, Your Grace!
Then he needs a son.
I repeat, what are you going to do about it?
I pray for it daily.
God' s death, he means it.
That thing out there, at least she' s fertile.
- But she' s not his wife.
- No, Catherine' s his wife...... and she' s barren as a brick.
Are you going to pray for a miracle?
There are precedents.
All right.
Pray by all means.
And my effort is to secure a divorce.
Have I your support, or have I not?
The Pope gave a dispensation, so that the King might marry...... his brother' s widow for state reasons.
We are to ask the Pope to dispense with his dispensation, also for state reasons?
I don' t like plodding, Thomas.
Well?
Then, clearly all we have to do is to approach His Holiness and ask him.
I think we might influence the decision of His Holiness.
By argument?
Argument certainly.
And pressure.
Pressure, applied to the Church?
The Church has its church property.
Pressure.
No, Your Grace, I' m not going to help you.
Then goodnight, Master More.
Let the dynasty die with Henry Vill and we' il have dynastic wars again.
Blood- witted barons ramping the country from end to end.
Is that what you want?
Very well.
England needs an heir.
Certain measures, perhaps regrettable...... perhaps not, there' s much in the Church which needs reformation, Thomas.
All right, regrettable.
But necessary to get us an heir.
Now, explain how you, as a councillor of England, can obstruct these measures...... for the sake of your own private conscience.
I think that when statesmen forsake their own private conscience...... for the sake of their public duties...... they lead their country by a short route to chaos.
And we shall have my prayers to fall back on.
You' d like that, wouldn' t you?
To govern the country with prayers?
Yes, I should.
I' d like to be there when you try.
Who will wear this after me?
Who' s our next chancellor?
You?
Fisher?
Suffolk?
- Fisher for me.
- Aye, but for the King?
What about my secretary, Master Cromwell?
Cromwell.
He' s a very able man.
But?
Me rather than Cromwell.
Then, come down to earth.
Until you do...... you and I are enemies.
As Your Grace wishes.
As God wills.
Perhaps, Your Grace.
More!
You should have been a cleric!
Like yourself, Your Grace?
Goodnight, Sir Thomas.
Sir Thomas.
- What' s this?
- From some grateful poor folk, in Leicester.
- Leicester?
- You do more good than you know, sir.
My daughter has a case, sir, in the Court of Poor Man' s Causes.
Baked apples, sir.
To sweeten my judgement.
I' il give your daughter the same judgement I would give my own.
A fair one, quickly.
Bless you, sir.
I understand.
Yes.
Thank you.
Good evening, Sir Thomas.
- I' il read it.
- It' s an awkward case.
- I could illuminate it for you -- - I' il read it.
Just a moment or two....
Boat!
Sir?
Chelsea, sir?
Chelsea.
I expect you' il make it worth my while, sir.
- You' ve got a licence?
- Bless you, yes sir, I' ve got a licence.
- Well then, the fares are fixed.
- They are, sir.
Hampton to Chelsea downstream, a penny halfpenny.
Chelsea to Hampton upstream, a penny halfpenny.
Whoever makes the regulations doesn' t row a boat.
No.
Threepence if you get me home for breakfast.
Thank you, sir.
A nice cup, sir.
Yes.
That' s worth money, sir.
Mind a way, sir.
Thank you, sir.
- Have you been here all night?
- Yes.
You said there was a post?
Yes.
I' il offer you a post, with a house, a servant and £50 a year.
What post?
At the new school.
A teacher!
Richard, no one' s going to give you a place at court.
Master Cromwell says he' il do something for me.
Cromwell?
Well, if you know Cromwell you don' t need my help.
Sir Thomas?
If only you knew how much, much rather, I had your help than his.
Not to a place at court.
Why not?
Look.
- What is it?
- It' s a bribe!
"I am the gift of Averil Machin."
And Averil Machin has a lawsuit in the Court of Requests.
Italian silver.
Take it.
No joke.
Thank you.
What will you do with it?
Sell it.
- And buy what?
- A decent gown!
But Richard, that' s a little bribe.
At court they offer you all sorts of things, home, manor houses, coats of arms.
A man should go where he won' t be tempted.
Why not be a teacher?
You' d be a fine teacher.
Perhaps a great one.
- You!
Your pupils.
Your friends.
God.
Not a bad public, that.
And a quiet life.
You say that.
You come from talking with the Cardinal.
Yes, talking with the Cardinal.
It' s eating your heart out, isn' t it?
The high affairs of state.
The divorce?
Boatman!
- Take this gentleman to the New lnn!
- Right, sir.
Sir Thomas?
Thank you.
Be a teacher.
- Matthew.
- Sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Lady Margaret?
- No, sir.
The Master Roper' s here, sir.
At this hour?
Who let him in?
He' s a hard man to keep out, sir.
Will wants to marry me, Father.
Well, he can' t marry you.
Sir Thomas, I' m called to the Bar.
Oh, congratulations, Roper.
My family may not be at the palace, but in the city --
There' s nothing wrong with your family, Will.
There' s not much wrong with you.
Except you seem to need a clock.
I can buy a clock, sir.
Roper, the answer is no...... and will be no as long as you' re a heretic.
Now, that' s a word I don' t like, Sir Thomas!
It' s not a likeable word or thing.
The Church is heretical!
Dr. Luther' s proved that to my satisfaction!
Luther is an excommunicate!
From a heretic Church!
Church?
It' s a shop!
- Salvation by the shilling!
And divorces!
- Will, no!
- What I know, I' il say!
- You' ve no sense of the place!
He' s no sense of the time.
Now listen well.
Two years ago you were a passionate churchman.
Now you' re a passionate Lutheran.
We must just pray that when your head' s finished turning...... your face is to the front again.
- ls your horse here?
- No, sir, I walked.
Well, take a horse from the stables and get back home.
Go along.
May I come again?
Yes.
Soon.
Is that final, Father?
As long as he' s a heretic, Meg, that' s absolute.
What did Wolsey want?
Nice boy, young Will.
Terribly strong principles, though.
Clumsy, too.
- You' re very pensive.
- You' re very gay.
Was it the divorce?
To bed.
They' re a cantankerous lot, the Ropers.
Always swimming against the stream.
Old Roper was just the same --
You don' t want to talk about it.
No.
- I' m sorry you were awakened, chick.
- I wasn' t sleeping very deeply.
What did Wolsey want?
- Will Roper' s been.
- Will Roper?
Yes, he' s been here all night.
He wants to marry Meg.
- Why you don' t beat that girl l -- - No.
She' s full of education and it' s a delicate commodity.
Goodnight, Meg.
Goodnight.
Marry Meg.
A lawyer' s son.
Well, she' s a lawyer' s daughter.
Norfolk spoke of you for Chancellor of England before he left.
Well, he' s a dangerous friend then.
Wolsey' s chancellor, God help him.
But Norfolk said, if Wolsey fell, you --
If Wolsey fell, the splash would swamp a few small boats like ours.
No.
There' il be no new chancellors while Wolsey lives.
The Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marshal of England.
Have you any message for His Majesty?
If I had served God...... one half so well as I' ve served my King...... God would not have left me here, to die in this place.
Thank God you' re dying here.
The King would have you die in the Tower.
"I am straightly charged by the King himself...
"... here openly to declare how much all England...
"... is beholden to this man.
"And how worthy he is to have the highest room in the realm.
"And how dearly the King' s grace doth love and trust him...
"... not only for much good council...
"... deliberate council, but for better council yet...
"... that which is privy to the King' s person.
"This same Sir Thomas More...
"... here made before you all to be...
"... Lord Chancellor of the Realm."
Calm yourself, Matthew.
Fetch Lady Alice.
That' s very well.
My lady!
The King!
Now remember, the visit' s a surprise.
But he' il know we' re expecting him --
It' s a very great honour.
One friend calling on another.
What' s he really coming for?
To talk about the divorce.
He wants an answer.
- But he' s had his answer.
- He wants another.
Your Majesty does my house more honour than I fear my household will bear.
No ceremony Thomas, no ceremony!
A passing fancy.
I happened to be on the river.
Look.
Mud.
By heaven, what an evening.
Lady Alice, I fear we came upon you unexpectedly.
Yes, Your Grace.
Well, no, Your Grace.
Well, that is, we are ready to entertain --
This is my daughter Margaret, sire.
She' s not yet had the honour to meet Your Grace.
Why Margaret, they told me you were a scholar.
Answer, Margaret.
Among women, I pass for one, Your Grace.
Can you dance, too?
Not well, Your Grace.
Well, I dance superlatively!
That' s a dancer' s leg, Margaret!
Lady Alice, the river' s given me an appetite.
If Your Grace would share a very simple supper.
It would please me.
Lead them in.
Thomas and I will follow.
Matthew.
My lords and gentlemen!
Margaret?
Your Grace?
Do you like music?
Yes, Your Grace.
They' il play to you.
Now, listen to this.
Sit down.
Be seated.
No courtship, Thomas.
You' re my friend, are you not?
Your Majesty.
Thank God I have a friend for my chancellor.
Readier to befriend, I trust, than he was to be chancellor.
My own knowledge of my poor abilities --
I will judge of your abilities.
You know that Wolsey named you for chancellor?
Before he died, Wolsey named you, and Wolsey was no fool.
He was a statesman of incomparable ability, Your Grace.
Was he?
Was he so?
Then, why did he fail me?
It was villainy then.
Yes, villainy.
Secret opposition, secret.
But deliberate, wilful, meditated opposition.
Wanted to be pope to master me, Wolsey.
What is it?
Thought!
Because I' m simple and plain and deal with every man straightforwardly.
Because of that I say, do they take me for a simpleton?
Wolsey was a proud man, Thomas.
Pride right through.
And he failed me.
Failed me in the one thing that matters, then as now.
But look.
Be seated.
What an evening.
A man could fight a lion.
Some men could, Your Grace.
Thomas...... touching this matter of my divorce.
Have you thought of it since we last spoke?
Of little else.
Then you see your way clear to me?
That you should put away Queen Catherine, sire?
Alas, as I think of it, I see so clearly...... that I cannot come with Your Grace, that my endeavour is...... not to think of it at all.
Then you haven' t thought enough!
Lilac.
We have them at Hampton.
Not so fine as this, though.
I' m in an excellent frame of mind.
Thomas, you must consider, I stand in peril of my soul.
It was no marriage.
I have lived in incest with my brother' s widow.
Leviticus:
"Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother' s wife."
Chapter 18, verse 16.
Yes, Your Grace.
But Deuteronomy --
Deuteronomy is ambiguous!
Your Grace, I' m not fitted to meddle in these matters.
To me, it seems a matter for the Holy See --
Thomas, does a man need a pope to tell him where he' s sinned?
It was a sin.
God' s punished me.
I' ve no son.
Son after son she' s borne me.
All dead at birth, or dead within the month.
I never saw the hand of God so clear in anything.
It' s my bounden duty to put away the Queen.
And all the popes, back to Peter, shall not come between me and my duty!
How is it that you cannot see?
Everyone else does.
Then, why does Your Grace need my poor support?
Because you' re honest.
And what is more to the purpose, you' re known to be honest.
Those like Norfolk follow me because I wear the crown.
Those like Cromwell follow because they' re jackals with sharp teeth...... and I' m their tiger.
A mass follows me...... because it follows anything that moves.
And then there' s you.
I am sick to think how much I must displease Your Grace.
No, Thomas, I respect your sincerity.
But respect...... man, that' s water in the desert.
How' d you like our music?
That air they played, it had a certain....
Well, tell me what you thought of it.
Could it have been Your Grace' s own?
Discovered!
Now I' il never know your true opinion, and that' s irksome.
Well, we artists, we love praise, yet we love truth better.
- Then I will tell my true opinion.
- Well?
To me it seemed delightful.
Thomas, I chose the right man for chancellor.
I should in fairness add that my taste in music is reputedly deplorable.
Your taste in music is excellent!
It exactly coincides with my own.
Music.
Music.
Send them back without me, Thomas.
I' il live here in Chelsea and make music.
My house is at Your Grace' s disposal.
Touching this other business, mark you...... I' il have no opposition.
Your Grace.
No opposition.
Be seated.
I' il leave you out of it but you are my chancellor.
I don' t take it kindly and I' il have no opposition!
I see how it will be.
The bishops will oppose me!
The full- fed princes of the Church!
Hypocrites!
All hypocrites!
Mind they do not take you in, Thomas!
Your Grace is unjust.
If I cannot serve Your Grace in this great matter of the Queen.
I have no queen!
Catherine' s not my wife!
No priest can make her so.
They that say she is my wife are not only liars, but traitors!
Yes, traitors!
That I will not brook now!
Treachery!
I will not brook.
It maddens me!
It is a deadly canker in the body politic, and I will have it out!
See?
You see how you' ve maddened me?
I hardly know myself.
If you could come with me, there' s no man I' d sooner raise...... yes, with my own hand.
Your Grace overwhelms me.
What' s that?
Eight o' clock, Your Grace.
Lift yourself up, man.
Have I not promised I' il leave you out of it?
Shall we eat?
If Your Grace pleases.
Eight o' clock, you said.
The tide will be turning.
- I was forgetting the tide.
I must go.
- I' m sorry, Your Grace.
If I don' t catch the tide I' il not get back to Richmond.
No, don' t come.
Lady Alice, I must go and catch the tide.
Affairs call me to court.
So we give you our thanks and we say goodnight!
What' s this?
- You crossed him!
- Somewhat.
- Why?
- I couldn' t find the other way.
You' re too nice altogether, Thomas.
- Woman, mind your house!
- I am minding my house!
God save Your Majesty!
God save Your Grace!
God save the King!
Lift!
Drop blades!
Are you coming my way, Rich?
No.
I think you should, you know.
I can' t tell you anything.
Well?
Thomas?
Stay friends with him.
Whatever may be done by smiling, you may rely on me to do.
Set your mind at rest.
This is not the stuff of which martyrs are made.
Good evening, sir, Lady Alice.
Will wants to talk to you, Father.
I told him it wouldn' t be convenient.
You were quite right.
You' re very free with my daughter' s hand, Roper.
Yes.
It' s of that I wish to speak.
Sir, you' ve had a disagreement with His Majesty.
- Have l?
- So Meg tells me.
I offer my congratulations.
If it' s true, is it a matter for congratulation?
Yes!
Sir, when last I asked you for your daughter' s hand...... you objected to my unorthodox opinions.
- I did.
- Yes.
Well, since then my views have somewhat modified.
Well, that' s good hearing, Will.
Mind you, I modify nothing concerning the various corruptions in the Church.
- Quite right.
- But an attack upon the Church herself...... no.
I see behind that an attack on God.
- Roper!
- The Devil' s work...... to be done by the Devil' s ministers!
For heaven' s sake, remember my office.
If you stand on your office --
No, I don' t stand on it, but there are certain things I may not hear.
Sir Thomas.
Richard?
I fell.
Lady Alice.
- Good evening.
Do you know William Roper, the younger?
By reputation, of course.
- Good evening, Master....
- Rich.
You' ve heard of me?
Yes.
In what connection?
I don' t know what you can have heard.
I sense that I' m not welcome here.
Have you done something to make you not welcome?
Cromwell is asking questions.
About you.
He' s always asking questions about you and your opinions.
Of whom?
Of him, for one.
That' s one of his sources.
Of course.
That' s one of my servants.
All right, Matthew.
Well, you look at me as though I were an enemy.
Why Richard, you' re shaking.
Help me.
How?
Employ me.
No.
- Employ me!
- No.
I would be faithful.
You couldn' t answer for yourself even so far as tonight.
Arrest him!
- For what?
- He' s dangerous!
- Libel.
He' s a spy!
- That man' s bad!
- There' s no law against that.
- God' s law!
- Then God can arrest him.
- While you talk, he' s gone!
Go he should, if he were the Devil, until he broke the law.
- Now you give the Devil benefit of law!
- Yes, what would you do?
Cut a road through the law to get after the Devil?
Yes.
I' d cut down every law in England to do that.
And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned on you...... where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat?
This country is planted with laws from coast to coast...... Man' s laws, not God' s, and if you cut them down...... and you' re just the man to do it...... do you really think you could stand upright in the wind that would blow then?
Yes.
I give the Devil benefit of law for my own safety' s sake.
- Master Rich?
- Yes.
In there, sir.
Rich?
Come in.
Taken you long enough to get here.
Have I kept you waiting?
Months.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Do you know the news?
- What news?
- Sir Thomas Paget is retiring.
And I succeed him.
Secretary to the Council?
You?
'Tis surprising, isn' t it?
I mean, one sees that' s logical.
Sit down, Rich.
No ceremony, no courtship...... as His Majesty would say.
You see how I trust you.
I' d never repeat or report a thing like that.
What kind of thing would you repeat or report?
Nothing said in friendship.
Do you believe that?
- Why, yes.
- No, seriously.
Well, yes.
Rich, seriously.
That would depend what I was offered.
Don' t say it just to please me.
It' s true.
It would depend what I was offered.
Well, there is another post vacant.
Collector of Revenues for York.
Is it in your gift?
Effectively.
What must I do for it?
I know a man who wants to change his woman.
Normally a matter of small importance, but in this case...... it' s our liege, Lord Henry, the eighth of that name.
Which is a quaint way of saying that if he wants to change his woman, he will.
And our job as administrators...... is to minimise the inconvenience which this is going to cause.
That' s our only job, Rich, to minimise the inconvenience of things.
A harmless occupation you would say, but no.
We administrators are not liked, Rich.
We are not popular.
I say "we" on the assumption you' il accept the post at York I' ve offered you.
Yes.
It' s a bad sign when people are depressed by their own good fortune.
- I' m not depressed.
- You look depressed.
I was lamenting.
I' ve lost my innocence.
Some time ago.
Have you only just noticed?
Your friend, our present Lord Chancellor, now there' s an innocent man.
The odd thing is, he is.
Yes, I say he is.
Unhappily...... his innocence is tangled up in this problem...... that you can' t change your woman without a divorce...... and you can' t get a divorce unless the Pope says so.
And from this meaningless circumstance, I foresee a certain measure of....
- lnconvenience?
- Just so.
This goblet he gave you, how much was it worth?
Come along, he gave you a silver goblet.
How much did you get for it?
Fifty shillings.
It was a gift, wasn' t it, from a litigant, a woman?
- Yes.
- Which court?
Chancery?
Don' t get drunk!
Which court was the litigant' s case?
Court of Requests.
There.
That wasn' t too painful, was it?
- No.
And you' il find it easier, next time.
My Lord Archbishop, my lords...... Reverend Doctors of the Church.
The answer of our liege, Lord Henry...... to his trusty well- beloved subjects...... pontiffs in the Canterbury Convocation.
"His Majesty...
"... acknowledges your humble admission of many grievous errors..."... for which he accepts...
"... the manumission of £100, 000 in token.
"Mindful for the well- being of the realm and the quietness of his subjects...
"... His Majesty requires that you do now straightly renounce your pretended...
"... allegiance to the See of Rome.
"And admit the statute passed through parliament...
"... acknowledging the King' s good title...
"... Supreme Head of the Church in England."
Well, my lords, what' s your answer?
Yea or nay?
His Majesty accepts your resignation very sadly.
He' s mindful of your goodness and past loyalty.
And in any matter concerning your honour and welfare he' il continue your good lord.
You will convey my humble gratitude.
- Help me with this.
- Not l.
- Alice?
- No.
Sun and moon, Master More, you' re taken for a wise man.
Is this wisdom?
To betray your ability...... abandon your station and forget your duty to your kith and kin?
Shall I, sir?
No, thank you, son Roper.
Margaret...... will you?
Yes.
If you want.
There' s my clever girl.
Well done, sir!
In my opinion, that thing' s a degradation.
I' il tell you my opinion of the King' s title, too --
Don' t!
Will, silence!
Remember, you have a wife now...... and may have children.
All right, Thomas, make me understand...... because I tell you, to me this looks like cowardice!
All right, I will.
This isn' t reformation, this is war against the Church.
Our King has declared war on the Pope because the Pope will not declare...
-... that our Queen is not his wife.
- And is she?
Is she?
Have I your word that what we say here is between us two?
Very well.
And if the King should command you to repeat what I may say?
I should keep my word to you.
Then what has become of your oath of obedience to the King?
You lay traps for me!
No, I show you the times.
We are at war with the Pope.
For the Pope' s a prince, isn' t he?
He is.
He' s also the descendant of St. Peter, our only link with Christ.
So you believe.
And will you forfeit all you have...... which includes the respect of your country, for a belief?
Because what matters is that I believe it, or rather, no...... not that I believe it, but that I believe it.
- I trust I make myself obscure?
- Perfectly.
Why do you insult me with this lawyer' s chatter?
Because I' m afraid.
Man, you' re ill.
This isn' t Spain, you know.
This is England.
My friends, you all know why I' ve called you here.
I have today resigned my office.
I am no longer a great man.
Sir, we want you to know that we' re all on your side.
My side?
What side is that?
Well, sir, we all know what you think.
None of you knows what I think.
And if you guess...... and babble it about, you do me no good service.
Since I am no more a great man, I no longer need a great household.
Nor can I afford one.
You will have to go.
However, I still number some great men among my friends...... and they still need great households.
No one will be turned away until we' ve found another place for him.
- We can' t find places for them all.
- Yes, we can.
Thank you.
That is all.
What about you, Matthew?
Will you stay?
Well, sir, that' s according.
There will be more work and less money.
Well then, I don' t see how I can then, sir.
After all, I' ve got my own --
Quite right, Matthew.
Why should you?
I shall miss you, Matthew.
Oh, no, sir, you see through me, sir.
I know that.
I shall miss you.
Damn me!
Isn' t that them all over!
What' s in me for him to miss?
"Matthew, will you take a cut in wages?"
No, Sir Thomas, I will not.
And that' s it.
All right, so he' s down on his luck, I' m sorry.
I don' t mind saying that I' m sorry, bad luck.
If I had good luck to spare he could have some!
I wish we could have good luck all the time.
I wish rainwater was beer!
I wish we had wings!
But we don' t.
Well, there' s an end of you.
What' il you do now?
Sit by the fire...... and make goslings in the ash?
Not at all, Alice.
I expect I' il write a bit...... I' il write...... I' il read, I' il think.
I think I' il learn to fish.
I' il play with my grandchildren when son Roper' s done his duty.
- Alice, shall I teach you to read?
- No, by God!
Poor, silly man, you think they' il leave you here to think?
If we govern our tongues, they will!
I' ve made no statement.
I' ve resigned, that' s all.
The King is made, by act of parliament, Supreme Head of the Church in England.
This English Church will divorce him from the Queen, then marry him to Lady Anne.
But on any of these matters, have you heard me make a statement?
No.
If I' m to lose my rank and fall to housekeeping, I want to know the reason.
- So make a statement now.
- No.
Alice, it' s a point of law.
Accept it from me...... that in silence is my safety, under the law.
And my silence must be absolute, it must extend to you.
In short, you don' t trust me.
I' m the Lord Chief Justice, I' m Cromwell, I' m the keeper of the Tower.
I take your hand...... I clamp it on the Bible, on the blessed Cross and I say:
"Woman, has your husband made a statement on these matters?
"On peril of your soul remember, what is your answer?"
No.
And so it must remain.
Have you opened your mind to Meg?
Would I tell Meg what I won' t tell you?
Meg has your heart.
I know that well enough.
This is a dangerous matter then...... if you' ve not told Meg.
I don' t think so.
No.
When they find I' m silent...... they' il want nothing better than to leave me silent.
You' il see.
But he' s silent, Master Secretary, why not leave him silent?
Your Grace, not being a man of letters...... you perhaps don' t realise the extent of his reputation.
This silence of his is bellowing up and down Europe!
In Europe he is claimed as the King' s enemy.
Rubbish!
Crank he may be, traitor he is not.
Exactly.
And with a little pressure....
With a little pressure he can be got to say so.
That' s all we need.
A brief declaration of his loyalty...
-... to the present administration.
- I still say, let sleeping dogs lie.
The King does not agree with you.
What kind of pressure do you think you can bring to bear?
I have evidence that Sir Thomas, while he was a judge, accepted bribes.
What?
Goddammit!
He was the only judge since Cato who didn' t accept bribes!
When was there a chancellor whose possessions, after three years...... totalled £100 and a gold chain?
It is, as you imply, common practice...... but a practice may be common and remain an offence.
This offence could send a man to the Tower.
Come here.
This woman' s name is Averil Machin.
She comes from Leicester.
- She entered a case -- - A property case it was.
Shut your mouth.
A property case in the Court of Requests in April, 1528.
And got a wicked false judgement!
And got an impeccably correct judgement from Sir Thomas.
- No, sir, it was not!
- Tell the gentleman...... about the gift you gave the judge.
I gave him a cup, sir.
A silver ltalian cup I bought in Leicester, for 100 shillings.
Did Sir Thomas accept this cup?
Yes, sir, he did.
He did accept it.
We can corroborate that.
You can go.
- To my way of thinking -- - Go!
- ls that your witness?
- No.
By an odd coincidence that cup later came into the hands of Master Rich here.
How?
- He gave it to me, Your Grace.
- Gave it to you?
Why?
A gift.
Yes, you were a friend, weren' t you?
When did Thomas give you this thing?
I can' t exactly remember.
Do you "remember" what you did with it?
- I sold it.
- Where?
- A shop.
- Has the shop still got it?
No.
They' ve lost all track of it.
How convenient.
You doubt Master Rich' s word, Your Grace?
It had occurred to me.
This is the bill of sale.
That cow put her case into court in April, you said.
This is dated May.
In other words, the moment Thomas knew the cup was a bribe...... he dropped it into the nearest gutter.
The facts will bear that interpretation, I suppose.
This is a horse that won' t run, Master Secretary.
Just a trial gallop.
We' il find something better.
- I want no part of it.
- You have no choice.
What' s that you say?
The King particularly wishes you to be active in this matter of Sir Thomas.
He' s not told me that.
Indeed?
He told me.
Look here, Cromwell...... what' s the purpose of all this?
There you have me.
It' s a matter of conscience, I think.
The King wants Sir Thomas to bless his marriage.
If Sir Thomas appeared at the wedding now, it might save us all a lot of trouble.
He won' t attend the wedding.
If I were you, I' d try and persuade him.
I really would try, if I were you.
Cromwell, are you threatening me?
My dear Norfolk, this isn' t Spain.
This is England!
Thomas!
Lady Margaret?
Yes.
We' ve been cutting greens.
We use them for fuel.
I have a letter for your father, Lady Margaret.
From Hampton Court.
He' s to answer certain charges before Secretary Cromwell.
Good of you to come, Sir Thomas.
Master Rich will make a record of our conversation.
Good of you to tell me, Master Secretary.
I think you know one another.
Indeed yes, we' re old friends.
That' s a nice gown you have, Richard.
Sir Thomas, believe me.
No, that' s asking too much.
But let me tell you all the same.
You have no more sincere admirer than myself.
No, not yet, Rich, not yet.
If I might hear the charges.
- The charges?
- I understand there are certain charges.
Some ambiguities of behaviour I should like to clarify, hardly charges.
Make a note of that, will you, Master Rich?
There are no charges.
The King is not pleased with you.
I am grieved.
And yet, do you know that even now, if you could bring yourself...... to agree with the Church, universities, the Lords and the Commons...... there is no honour which His Majesty would be likely to deny you?
I am well acquainted with His Grace' s generosity.
Very well.
You have heard of the so- called "Holy Maid of Kent"...... who was executed for prophesying against the King?
- Yes, I met her.
- Yes, you met her.
Yet you did not warn His Majesty of her treason.
How was that?
She spoke no treason.
Our talk was not political.
But the woman was notorious.
Do you expect me to believe that?
- Happily, there were witnesses.
- You wrote a letter to her.
Yes.
I wrote, advising her to abstain from meddling in the affairs of state.
I have a copy of the letter.
Also witnessed.
- You have been cautious.
- I like to keep my affairs regular.
In the June of 1521, the King published a book.
A theological work.
It was called, A Defence of the Seven Sacraments.
For which he was named "Defender of the Faith" by His Holiness, the Pope.
By the Bishop of Rome, or do you insist on "pope"?
No.
"Bishop of Rome" if you like.
It doesn' t alter his authority.
Thank you.
You come to the point very readily.
What is that authority?
For example, in the Church of England...... what exactly is the Bishop of Rome' s authority?
You will find it very ably set out and defended, Master Secretary...... in the King' s book.
In the book published under the King' s name, would be more accurate.
- You wrote this book.
- I wrote no part of it.
I don' t mean you actually held the pen.
I answered to my best ability, some points of common law...... which the King put to me, as I was bound to do.
Do you deny you instigated it?
It was from first to last the King' s own project.
The King says not.
The King knows the truth of it.
And whatever he may have said to you...... he will not give evidence to support this accusation.
Why not?
Because evidence is given on oath, and he will not perjure himself.
If you don' t know that, then you don' t yet know him.
Sir Thomas More.
Have you anything to say...... regarding the King' s marriage with Queen Anne?
I understood I was not to be asked that again.
Then you understood wrongly.
They are terrors for children, Master Secretary, not for me!
Then know that the King commands me to charge you...... in his name, with great ingratitude!
And to tell you that there never was, nor could be, so villainous a servant...... nor so traitorous a subject, as yourself!
So...... I am brought here at last.
Brought?
You' ve brought yourself to where you stand now.
You may go.
For the present.
What will you do now?
Whatever' s necessary.
Boat!
Oh, come, come, it' s not as bad as all that!
Howard!
I can' t get home.
They won' t bring me a boat.
Do you blame them?
Is it as bad as that?
It' s every bit as bad as that!
Then it' s good of you to be seen with me.
I followed you.
Were you followed?
- You' re dangerous to know!
- Then don' t know me.
- I do know you.
- I mean as a friend.
- I am your friend.
I wish I wasn' t, but I am.
- What' s to be done then?
- Give in.
- I can' t give in, Howard.
Our friendship' s more mutable than that.
The one fixed point in the world of turning friendship...
-... is that Sir More won' t give in.
- To me it has to be, for that' s myself.
Affection goes as deep in me as you, I think.
But only God is love right through, Howard, and that' s my self.
And who are you?
A lawyer!
And a lawyer' s son!
We' re supposed to be the proud ones, the arrogant ones, we' ve all given in.
Why must you stand out?
Goddammit man!
It' s disproportionate!
You' il break my heart.
No one is safe, Howard, and you have a son.
We' il end our friendship now.
- For friendship' s sake?
- Yes.
Daft!
Norfolk, you' re a fool!
You can' t place a quarrel, you haven' t the style.
Hear me out.
You and your class have given in, as you rightly call it...... 'cause this country' s religion means nothing to you at all.
Well, that' s a foolish saying for a start!
The nobility of England --
The nobility of England would have snored through the Sermon on the Mount!
But you' il labour like scholars over a bulldog' s pedigree.
An artificial quarrel is not a quarrel.
We' ve had a quarrel since the day we met.
Our friendship was mere sloth.
You can be cruel when you want, but I' ve always known that.
What do you value in your bulldogs?
Gripping, is it not?
- Yes.
- It' s their nature?
- Yes.
- It' s why you breed them?
It' s so with men.
I will not give in, because I oppose it.
Not my pride, not my spleen, nor any other of my appetites, but I do, l.
Is there, in the midst of all this muscle, no sinew that serves no appetite...... of Norfolk' s, but is just Norfolk?
- Give that some exercise, my lord!
- Thomas!
As you stand you' il go before your Maker ill conditioned!
Now steady.
And he' il think that, somewhere back along your pedigree, a bitch got over the wall!
Cast in this very house on April 3, last year...... it is a matter very fit for the Commons, gathered here...... in parliament, to take in hand.
Or, in consequence of the decay of guilds...... the woolen cloth, now coming out of Yorkshire, Lincoln...... and the like, is not to blame and this....
I will defer the rest of my matter to later.
That the loyal Commons, here assembled, will speedily enact this bill, I doubt not.
For as much as it concerns the King' s new title and his marriage to Queen Anne.
Both matters pleasing to a loyal subject.
Mark, my Masters...... there is among us a brood of discreet traitors...... to which deceit the King can brook no longer.
And we, his loyal huntsmen, must now drive these subtle foxes from their covert.
Father?
Margaret!
I couldn' t get a boat.
What is it, Meg?
Father, there' s a new act going through parliament.
And by this act, they' re going to administer an oath...... about the marriage.
On what compulsion is the oath?
- High treason.
- But what is the wording?
Do the words matter?
We know what it means.
Tell me the words.
An oath is made of words.
It may be possible to take it.
Take it?
And if it can be taken, you must take it, too.
No!
Listen, Meg.
God made the angels to show him splendour.
As he made animals for innocence and plants for their simplicity.
But Man he made to serve him wittily, in the tangle of his mind.
If he suffers us to come to such a case that there is no escaping...... then we may stand to our tackle as best we can.
And yes, Meg, then we can clamour like champions, if we have the spittle for it.
But it' s God' s part, not our own, to bring ourselves to such a pass.
Our natural business lies in escaping.
If I can take this oath, I will.
I would, for my sake, you could take the oath.
I never took a man into the Tower less willingly.
Thank you, Master Governor.
Thank you.
Sir Thomas.
This is iniquitous.
- Where to this time?
- Richmond Palace.
Sit down.
This is the Seventh Commission to inquire into the case...... of Sir Thomas More, appointed by His Majesty' s Council.
Have you anything to say?
No.
- Seen this document before?
- Many times.
It is the Act of Succession.
These are the names of those who have sworn to it.
- I have, as you say, seen it before.
- Will you swear to it?
No.
Thomas, we must know --
We must know plainly whether you recognise the offspring of Queen Anne...... as heirs to the throne.
The King in parliament tells me that they are.
- Of course I recognise them.
- Will you swear to it?
- Yes.
- Then why won' t he swear to the act?
Because there is more than that in the act.
Just so.
Sir Thomas, it states in the preamble that the King' s former marriage...... to the Lady Catherine was unlawful...... she being his brother' s widow and the Pope having no authority to sanction it.
Is that what you deny?
Is that what you dispute?
Is that what you are not sure of?
You insult His Majesty and Council in the person of the Lord Archbishop!
I insult no one.
I will not take the oath.
I will not tell you why I will not.
- Then your reasons must be treasonable!
- Not "must be," may be.
It' s a fair assumption!
The law requires more than an assumption, the law requires a fact.
Of course, I cannot judge your legal standing in the case...... but until I know the ground of your objections...... I can only guess your spiritual standing, too.
If you' re willing to guess that, it should be small matter to guess my objections.
Then you do have objections to the act?
Well, we know that, Cromwell!
No, my lord, you don' t.
You may suppose I have objections, all you know is that I will not swear to it...... for which you cannot lawfully harm me further.
But if you were right in supposing me to have objections, and right again...... in supposing my objections to be treasonable...... the law would let you cut my head off.
Oh, yes.
Well done, Sir Thomas.
I' ve been trying to make that clear to His Grace for some time.
Oh, confound all this!
I don' t know if the marriage was lawful or not...... but damn it, Thomas, look at these names.
Why can' t you do as I did, and come with us, for fellowship?
And when we die, and you are sent to heaven for doing your conscience...... and I am sent to hell for not doing mine, will you come with me, for fellowship?
So, those of us whose names are there, are damned, Sir Thomas?
I have no window to look into another man' s conscience.
I condemn no one.
- Then the matter is capable of question?
- Certainly.
But that you owe obedience to the King is not capable of question.
So weigh a doubt against a certainty and sign.
Some men think the earth is round, others think it flat.
It is a matter capable of question.
But if it is flat, will the King' s command make it round?
And if it is round, will the King' s command flatten it?
No, I will not sign.
Then you have more regard for your own doubt than the King' s command?
- For myself I have no doubt.
- No doubt of what?
No doubt that I will not take this oath.
But why I will not, you, Master Secretary, will not trick out of me.
I might get it out of you in other ways.
You threaten like a dockside bully.
How should I threaten?
Like a minister of state, with justice!
Justice is what you' re threatened with.
Then I am not threatened.
Gentlemen, can' t I go to bed?
Aye.
The prisoner may retire as he requests.
- Unless you -- - I see no purpose in prolonging this.
Then, goodnight, Thomas.
May I have one or two more books?
Why, you have books?
Yes.
I didn' t know, you shouldn' t have.
May I see my family?
No.
Captain!
Master Secretary?
Have you ever heard the prisoner speak of the King' s divorce, supremacy...
-... or the King' s marriage?
- No, not a word.
If he does, you will repeat it to me.
Of course.
Rich.
Tomorrow morning, remove the prisoner' s books.
Is that necessary?
With regards to this case, the King is becoming impatient.
- Aye, with you.
- With all of us.
The King' s impatience will embrace a duke or two.
Master Secretary.
Sir Redvers Llewellyn has retired.
The Attorney General for Wales.
His post is vacant.
You said that I might approach you.
Not now, Rich.
He must!
Rack him.
No.
The King' s conscience will not permit it.
We have to find some other way.
Father!
What?
Margaret?
Father!
Meg.
For God' s sake, they haven' t put you in here?
- No, sir, a visit.
- A brief one, Sir Thomas.
- Good morning, husband.
- Good morning.
Good morning, Will.
Well, this is a hellish place!
Except it' s keeping me from you, my dears, it isn' t so bad.
It' s remarkably like any other place.
- It drips!
- Yes.
It' s too near the river.
Well, what is it?
Father, come out!
Swear to the act and come out!
Is this why they' ve let you come?
Yes.
Meg' s under oath to persuade you.
That was silly, Meg.
How do you plan to do that?
Father.
"God more regards the thoughts of the heart than the words of the mouth."
- Well, so you' ve always told me.
- Yes.
Then say the words of the oath and in your heart think otherwise.
What is an oath then, but words we say to God?
Listen, Meg.
When a man takes an oath, he' s holding his own self in his own hands...... Iike water.
And if he opens his fingers then, he needn' t hope to find himself again.
Some men aren' t capable of this, but I' d be loathed to think your father one of them.
- I have another argument.
- Oh, Meg.
In any state that was half good, you would be raised up high, not here...
-... for what you' ve done already.
- All right.
It' s not your fault the state' s three- quarters bad.
No.
If you elect to suffer for it, you elect to be a hero.
That' s very neat.
But look now.
If we lived in a state where virtue was profitable...... common sense would make us saintly.
But since we see that avarice, anger, pride and stupidity...... commonly profit far beyond charity, modesty, justice and thought...... perhaps we must stand fast a little...... even at the risk of being heroes.
But in reason!
Haven' t you done as much as God can reasonably want?
Well, finally it isn' t a matter of reason.
Finally, it' s a matter of love.
You' re content then to be shut up here with mice and rats...
-... when you might be home with us?
- Content?
If they' d open a crack that wide, I' d be through it like a bird and back to Chelsea.
I haven' t told you what the house is like without you.
Don' t, Meg.
- What we do in the evening without you.
- Meg, have done.
We don' t read because we' ve no candles.
We don' t talk because we wonder what they' re doing to you.
The King is more merciful.
He doesn' t use the rack.
Two minutes to go, sir.
- I thought you' d like to know.
- Two minutes!
- Jailer!
- Sorry, sir.
Two minutes.
Listen, you must leave the country.
All of you must leave the country.
- And leave you?
- It makes no difference.
They won' t let me see you again.
You must all go on the same day, but not on the same boat.
- Different boats from different ports.
- After the trial, then.
There' il be no trial, they have no case.
Do this for me, I beseech you.
- Will?
- Yes, sir.
- Margaret?
- Yes.
Alice?
- Alice, I command you!
- Right.
This is splendid.
- I know who packed this.
- I packed it.
Yes.
You still make a superlative custard, Alice.
Do l?
That' s a nice dress you have on.
Nice colour anyway.
My God, you think little of me!
I know I' m a fool...... but I' m not such a fool as to be lamenting for my dresses...... or to relish complimenting on my custards.
I' m well rebuked.
- Alice -- - No!
I' m sick with fear when I think of the worst they may do to me.
But worse than that will be to go with you not understanding why I go.
I don' t.
If you can tell me that you understand, I might make a good death, if I have to.
- Your death' s no good to me.
- You must tell me that you understand.
I don' t!
I don' t believe this had to happen!
If you say that I don' t see how I' m to face it.
It' s the truth!
- You' re an honest woman.
- Much good may it do me.
I' il tell you what I' m afraid of...... that when you' ve gone, I shall hate you for it.
You mustn' t, Alice.
You mustn' t.
As for understanding, I understand you' re the best man I ever met or ever likely to.
And if you go, God knows why I suppose, though as God' s my witness...... God' s kept deadly quiet about it.
And if any one wants to know my opinion of the King and his Council...... he only has to ask for it!
Why, it' s a lion I married.
A lion.
This is good.
It' s very good.
Sorry, Sir Thomas!
- Oh, for pity' s sake!
- Time' s up, sir.
- But one more minute!
- You don' t know what you' re asking.
- Come along, Miss.
- For heaven' s sake.
Now, don' t do that, sir.
Now, madam, don' t make trouble.
Come along, please, Lady Alice.
Take your muddy paws off me!
Filthy, stinking, gutter- fed, turnkey!
I' il see you suffer for this!
Goodbye.
You must understand my position, sir.
I' m a plain, simple man and I just want to keep out of trouble.
Dear Lord Jesus, my soul Saviour, clear my wits.
Dear Lady, Blessed Mother of God, comfort my wife and daughter...... and forgive me for them.
Sir Thomas More, though you have heinously offended the King' s majesty...... we hope that if you' il even now forethink and repent of obstinate opinion...... you may still taste his gracious pardon.
My lords, I thank you.
As for the matters you may charge me with...... I fear from my present weakness, that neither my wit...... nor my memory will serve...... to make sufficient answer.
I should be glad to sit down.
A chair for the prisoner.
Master Secretary Cromwell, have you the charge?
- I have, my lord.
- Then read the charge.
"That you did wilfully and maliciously deny and deprive...
"... our liege, Lord Henry, of his undoubted certain title...
"... Supreme Head of the Church in England."
But, I have never denied this title.
At Westminster Hall, at Lambeth, and again at Richmond...... you stubbornly refused the oath.
Was this no denial?
No, this was silence.
And for my silence, I am punished with imprisonment.
- Why have I been called again?
- On a charge of high treason, Sir Thomas.
For which the punishment is not imprisonment.
Death...... comes for us all, my lords.
Yes, even for kings he comes.
The death of kings is not in question, Sir Thomas.
Nor mine, I trust, until I' m proven guilty.
Your life lies in your own hands, Thomas, as it always has!
Is that so, my lord?
Then I' il keep a good grip on it.
So, Sir Thomas...... you stand on your silence?
I do.
But, gentlemen of the jury...... there are many kinds of silence.
Consider first the silence of a man when he is dead.
Suppose we go into the room where he is laid out and we listen.
What do we hear?
Silence.
What does it betoken, this silence?
Nothing.
This is silence pure and simple.
But let us take another case.
Suppose I were to take a dagger from my sleeve...... and make to kill the prisoner with it.
And my lordships there, instead of crying out for me to stop, maintain their silence.
That would betoken!
It would betoken a willingness that I should do it.
And under the law, they would be guilty with me.
So silence can, according to the circumstances...... speak.
Let us consider now the circumstances of the prisoner' s silence.
The oath was put to loyal subjects all over the country who all declared...... His Grace' s title to be just and good!
But when it came to the prisoner, he refused!
He calls this "silence."
Yet, is there a man in this court....
Is there a man in this country...... who does not know Sir Thomas More' s opinion of this title?
Yet, how can this be?
Because this silence betokened...... nay, this silence was not silence at all, but most eloquent denial!
Not so.
Not so, Master Secretary.
The maxim of the law is, "Silence gives consent."
If, therefore, you wish to construe what my silence betokened...... you must construe that I consented, not that I denied.
Is that in fact what the world construes from it?
Do you pretend that is what you wish the world to construe from it?
The world must construe according to its wits.
This court must construe according to the law.
My lords, I wish to call Sir Richard Rich!
Richard Rich, come into court.
"I do swear the evidence I' il give before the court shall be the truth...
"... the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."
"So help me God," sir.
"So help me God."
Now Rich, on May 12, you were at the Tower?
- I was.
- For what purpose?
I was sent to carry away the prisoner' s books.
- Did you talk with the prisoner?
- Yes.
Did you talk of the King' s supremacy of the Church?
Yes.
What did you say?
I said to him, "Supposing there were an act of parliament...
"... to say that I, Richard Rich, were to be king.
"Would not you, Master More, take me for king?"
"That I would," he said.
"For then you would be king."
Yes?
Then he said, "But I will put you a higher case.
"How, if there were an act of parliament, to say that God should not be God?"
- This is true and then you said -- - Silence!
Continue.
But then I said, "I will put you a middle case.
"Parliament has made our King Head of the Church.
"Why will you not accept him?"
Well?
And then he said, "Parliament had not the power to do it."
Repeat the prisoner' s words.
He said:
"Parliament had not the competence."
Or words to that effect.
He denied the title!
He did.
In good faith, Rich, I am sorrier for your perjury than my peril.
- Do you deny this?
- Yes!
You know if I were a man who heeded not the taking of an oath...... I need not be here.
Now, I will take an oath.
If what Master Rich has said is true...... I pray I may never see God in the face.
Which I would not say, were it otherwise, for anything on earth!
- That is not evidence.
- ls it probable....
Is it probable that after so long a silence on this...... the very point so urgently sought of me...... I should open my mind to such a man as that?
Sir Richard, do you wish to modify your testimony?
No, my lord.
Is there anything you wish to take away from it?
No, my lord.
Have you anything to add?
No, my lord.
- Have you, Sir Thomas?
- To what purpose?
I am a dead man.
You have your will of me.
Then the witness may withdraw.
There is one question I would like to ask the witness.
That' s a chain of office you' re wearing.
The Red Dragon.
What' s this?
Sir Richard is appointed Attorney General for Wales.
For Wales.
Why Richard, it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world.
But for Wales.
My lords!
I' ve done.
The jury will retire and consider the evidence.
Considering the evidence, it shouldn' t be necessary for them to retire.
Is it necessary?
Then is the prisoner guilty or not guilty?
Guilty, my lord!
Sir Thomas More, you have been found guilty of high treason.
- The sentence of the court -- - My lords!
When I was practising the law, the manner was to ask the prisoner...... before pronouncing sentence, if he had anything to say.
Have you anything to say?
Yes.
Since the court has determined to condemn me...... God knoweth how...... I will now discharge my mind...... concerning the indictment and the King' s title.
The indictment is grounded in an act of parliament...... which is directly repugnant...... to the law of God and His Holy Church.
The supreme government of which no temperable person...... may by any law presume to take upon him.
This was granted...... by the mouth...... of our Saviour, Christ Himself...... to St. Peter and the bishops of Rome whilst He lived...... and was personally present...... here on earth.
It is therefore insufficient in law...... to charge any Christian to obey it.
And more than this...... the immunity of the Church is promised both in Magna Carta...... and in the King' s own coronation oath.
Now, we plainly see you are malicious!
Not so.
I am the King' s true subject...... and I pray for him and all the realm.
I do none harm.
I say none harm.
I think none harm.
And if this be not enough to keep a man alive...... then in good faith, I long not to live.
Nevertheless...... it is not for the supremacy that you have sought my blood...... but because I would not bend to the marriage!
You have been found guilty of high treason.
The sentence of the court is that you be taken...... to the Tower of London...... until the day hence to the appointment...... for your execution!
I am commanded by the King to be brief...... and since I am the King' s obedient subject...... brief I will be.
I die His Majesty' s good servant...... but God' s first.
I forgive you, right readily.
Be not afraid of your office.
You send me to God.
You' re very sure of that, Sir Thomas?
He will not refuse one who is so blithe to go to him.
Thomas More' s head was stuck on Traitor' s Gate for a month.
Then his daughter, Margaret, removed it and kept it 'til her death.
Cromwell was beheaded for high treason five years after More.
The Archbishop was burned at the stake.
The Duke of Norfolk should have been executed for high treason...... but the King died of syphilis the night before.
Richard Rich became Chancellor of England...... and died in his bed.
Based on the true story
I always wanted to be in the movies
When I was Iittle I thought for sure 1 day, I could be a big big star...
Or maybe just beautiful...
BeautifuI and rich, Iike the women on TV

They didn' t know that who I was gonna be
But 1 day they' II aII see
And I thought for sure, it could be Iike that
But I always secretly Iooking for who is gonna discover me?
Was it this guy?
Or maybe this one?
You never knew
They would somehow believe in me just enough
They would see me for what I could be, they think I was beautifuI
Like a diamond in a rough
And my new world
Yeah, I Iived that way for Iong Iong time
And my head dreaming Iike that
It was nice 1 day it just stopped
Shame... aII I want is a beer

No
Madam our services are for patrons only
Give me a beer whatever the shit is
So what it is Iike, a gay place or what?

Aileen and Selby never spoken again
After 12 years on Florida' s Death Row
The trouble with humor is that people think you must be joking
Today, "Tales of the Swedish Countryside" -
- takes us to the swirling rivers of the province of Dalecarlia.
Where able- bodied men float lumber, the gold of the woods.
This is a job for real men!
28, 29, 30...... 31, 32, 33, 34...... and swallow.
- Good morning, Mr Dahlgren.
- Good morning.
- How was your bowel movement?
- Have you slept well, Gudrun?
- No, I have a terrible headache.
Those are withdrawal symptoms due to a lack of coffee.
Don' t forget our meeting.
There are only two guests this week, and you know what that means.
Either we go bankrupt, or we' il have to go with the times.
We also need a new name.
Something with a modern ring to it.
Well, the name was good enough for Dad.
We must be doing something wrong, we don' t have enough guests.
"The New Granhedsgården"?
Kulla - gården changed its name like that.
This movie is based on countless eye- popping headlines
SOMEWHERE IN SCOTLAND
He' s here five times a day, he must have bulimia.
- I bet it' s for his grandchildren.
- I hope so, for his sake.
DlET BREAKTHROUGH Arne, 57, lost 50 kilos
I' m Rebecka Melin.
I' m Stig Helmer Olsson.
- Are you throwing a kiddy party?
- No, not exactly...
Okay...
See you around.
An "authorized witch"?
We have an appointment with Ole Bramserud.
Hi there!
- Hello, I' m Ole Bramserud.
- How' s the golf game?
- I just don' t have the time anymore.
Picture two professional musicians dressed in chicken suits.
I' il sing the jingle and Niklas will show you the storyboard.
"Thou tender, thou tasty and delightful"
Then a voice- over says:
"Grace your table with a Svea Broiler".
Svea Broiler, the Swedish speciality.
- How do you get blue chickens?
- In the computer.
Everything' s digital.
We' il pan in and out, and add landscaping -
- and more chickens, if necessary.
That sounds expensive.
We' re talking about an additional 300, 000 to 400, 000.
For extra editing procedures.
Can we really afford an ad campaign for three million kronor?
- Bold moves for desperate times.
- I hope you know what you' re doing.
Were they in mourning?
They wore black.
No, that' s the way admen dress nowadays.
While Frankfurt was down 2, 3%.
- Here' s your laundry.
- Hello, Ma.
What are we going to do with you, Stig Helmer?
You can' t stay glued to the TV like some kind of couch potato.
Just look at you, you used to be so slim.
You should join "The Poundhunters".
Elsa lost 15 kilos, you know.
Your fingers are all yellow, have you started smoking?
- That' s from the snacks.
- All that junk...
Why are you watching this?
The remote control is broken.
I' il do the vacuuming next week, but please pick the place up a bit.
She wasn' t really right for you.
Bye, take care.
Could you possibly give me a hand?
- I' d like to rearrange some stuff.
- Do you have a cat?
- A cat?
I thought I heard a cat in distress.
Maybe the sound came from upstairs.
I don' t think it' s right to keep cats in town.
- This is how I live.
- It' s nice.
- What' s that?
- Whales.
I like to meditate to their songs.
Hear the heartbeat...
It' s the sound you heard in the womb.
Please give me a hand with the bed.
There' s some negative energy over here.
Have you heard of Feng Shui?
It' s about fields of energy, ley lines.
Help pull the bed over here a bit.
That' s fine.
No, it doesn' t feel right.
There' s too much Sha Qi from that corner...
East...
No, it' s in conflict with my kuan number.
Let' s have another go at it.
Be careful, now.
This feels good...
It' il work if I put a bagua in the corner.
What' s your sign?
No, don' t tell me...
You' re a Taurus, aren' t you?
You move like a Taurus.
- What date?
- May 5th.
The fifth day of the fifth month, what a surprise!
That means you' re a romantic that likes to be in the spotlight.
I don' t know about that...
Thanks, please accept a photograph of your aura.
Put your hand right there.
I' m going to take a picture of your aura, your magnetic field.
Say cheese!
I was only kidding.
That' s weird, you hardly have an aura at all.
Your chakras appear to be out of harmony.
Your sahasra seems to be blocked.
And you blinked.
- Are you sad about something?
- I' m not exactly happy...
- You should consider therapy.
- I don' t know about that...
Think about it.
I could be your coach.
I could be your personal guidance counselor.
THE POUNDHUNTERS 71 kilos.
Wow, you' ve lost 8 kilos!
That' s fantastic!
Could you tell us your secret?
My mother' s been visiting for two weeks now, and she thinks I' m fat -
- so she nags me a lot, and I clean house to blow off steam.
I guess cleaning is good exercise.
Camilla.
77 kilos.
You' ve gained two kilos.
Invite your mother to stay!
- How was it?
- Embarassing.
Everyone seems to lose weight but me.
It' s expensive too - 4, 000 kronor!
For that you get weighed in public every two weeks -
- and you get a skimpy booklet of diet tips.
For 2, 000 you can weigh yourself alone at my place.
I' m going to quit "The Poundhunters" and start dieting for real.
- 70 kilos?
- It must be a slow news day.
Some ley lines...
A pinch of Sha Qi...... and some negative energy...
Some Feng Shui...
A splash of therapy...
And the singing of the whales...
Hello, I brought you something to cheer you up.
Here, it' s the very latest thing.
Height:
Sex: male, right?
- Just step right up.
- On that thing?
Your weight is 102 kilos, your body mass index is 28.
Recommended dietary intake 6- 7 megajoules if sendentary.
Have a nice day.
Great, isn' t it?
And if it doesn' t behave itself, just remove the batteries.
Found yourself a job yet?
- No, I' m too old...
- Too old?
Don' t give up!
Like I' ve always said, life is full of possibilities.
You' re just a trifle too pregnant, that' s all.
Is this what you had in mind?
I had pictured something a bit more humoristic.
What should we try then?
How about this?
Not bad...
- Do you have chicken suits?
- Yes, this way.
Would you prefer the kind with an eggshell hat?
- They' re very popular.
- No, thank you.
- Cowls or just beaks?
- Cowls, please.
How about accessories?
Like an egg basket that squeaks?
Or an inflatable cock' s comb?
- I hope these will do.
- They' re great.
Okay, you guys, put the costumes on.
Phat!
Your jacket' s phat.
Is it vintage?
You know - old.
- I bought it in 1970.
- It' s so happening.
Take a look.
We did a spread for Wallpaper yesterday.
You' ve always been a happening guy.
"Thou free- ranging chicken, thou star of the north"
You' re standing too close together.
- "Svea Broiler", take 11.
- Playback.
- The mike is showing.
- Take 37.
"One hen per 10 square meters."
We' re finished.
Damned European Union...
Pretty soon every chicken will be entitled to its own bathroom.
The Danes have dumped the price of broilers.
This won' t do...
We' re history.
Maybe we should accept that ridiculous Danish bid.
- Or go into receivership.
- Go bust?
I' d rather go to hell.
I' ve got to cancel our commercial with that Norwegian guy.
What insurance do we have?
Full coverage.
- Why do you ask?
- In case something should happen.
It' s nice to get away from the rat race, isn' t it?
Go ahead and torture me.
- You' re late.
Are you very busy?
- Yeah, with a tricky commercial.
Let' s get started on our regular program.
Good work, Ole.
Slow down on your way back and bend your elbows.
Sorry about that, it' s my cell phone.
Bramserud Advertising.
Okay...
Well, no more tricky commercial...
Damn!
- What is it?
- My arm is going numb.
That' s not good.
My friend' s a cardiologist.
- What' s that?
- A heart specialist.
- I' m Ole Bramserud.
You' il find Doctor Westerberg over there.
- Karin Westerberg.
You' re not Swedish, are you?
But you are burning yourself out.
- That' s trendy.
- You' re no longer in your 20s.
Slow down a bit, both with regard to work and work- outs.
Take walks instead, take a week off and pamper yourself.
I won' t need a walker?
- I' ve fried you a chicken.
- Don' t mention the creatures!
The broiler factory' s giving us trouble.
I' m sorry to hear that.
- What' s that?
- I' m dieting.
What is it this time, the pineapple diet?
The stewardess method?
Your phone calls last longer than your diets!
That stuff smells like our chicken feed.
How much do they charge for it?
590 kronor.
Do you know how much it costs to manufacture it?
2 or 3 kronor, tops!
590 kronor...
For accurate readings, both feet must be placed on scales.
You have lost 49 kilos.
Congratulations.
You weigh 142 kilos.
Your body mass index, body mass index...
Hands up!
What are you doing?
- Why are you waving a golf club?
- I thought you were a burglar.
Someone broke into the Lundin' s place last week.
Aren' t you supposed to eat regularly?
And shouldn' t you avoid drinking concentrated sauces?
That stuff' s supposed to be diluted.
Bruno, what should I do?
I can' t handle this any more.
Go somewhere, try a week at a spa.
Either that, or we' il just have to buy a fridge with a time lock.
Good night.
Lift your feet up.
Therapy?
Well, I never!
Throwing out good money on therapy when you' re unemployed.
No one in our family has ever done anything like that.
- It' s a spa, Ma.
- What' s the difference?
I bet that Norwegian friend of yours is behind this.
The vacuum cleaner' s clogged with cheese oodles again.
They' re called "Cheese Doodles", Ma.
I' il be back at three.
- What should I do with these?
- Send them back to Anderhage.
Don' t even mention the word 'chicken' in the future.
I won' t, Boss.
That feels better.
- Are you going to the New Age Fair?
- I' il be working at Granhedsgården.
- Peeling carrots?
- No, they' re making the place over.
They' re offering a specialty week called "The Whole Person".
- How much do I owe you?
- 625 plus tax.
- Do you accept credit cards?
- Do you like your new place?
- The vibes are good.
- How are the neighbors?
- One' s coming along to the spa.
- Someone sorely in need of therapy.
- Is he?
- He' s a bulimic mommy' s boy.
- The silent type.
- Out of touch with his feelings.
I' m going to coach him.
It' s going to be challenging.
It' s my pleasure to welcome Dr Levander.
I' m sure you' re familiar with his TV shows and books -
- like "Eating the Right Way" or "I Can Fly".
They' il be on sale at the desk.
- Please go ahead.
- Thank you, Ulla.
Right now, the trend in holistic medicine is specialty weeks.
The idea is to offer package deals to massage the soul.
Modern people want more than just a plate full of raw vegetables.
- of activities that should be available at a modern spa.
The first heading is Stress Management -
- with activities such as Basic Yoga, Tai Chi, Qi Gong -
- Shiatsu Therapy and Sacred Dancing.
The next heading is Fitness.
This includes Aerobics, Step- up, Spinning -
- Aqua Aerobics, Mantric Jogging, Mud packs and Aromatherapy.
A new feature is underwater speakers -
- that play the song of the dolphins.
Cosmology and Mentalism -
- Heart- walks, Walking on hot coals and Survival courses.
Another new feature is that guests may bring their pets along -
- to meet a dietician or a psychologist.
The canine jacuzzi is very popular.
Last, but not least, we come to the menu.
Our target group expects something fancier than grated carrots.
- Any questions?
- Ping- pong yoga...
- Quiet, Nisse!
- That' s Qi Gong.
Their special package deal is called "The Whole Person".
But you want to return half as big, right?
- Should we give it a try, you think?
- Yes, you need to diet.
And I need to take it easy.
5, 000 kronor.
One week, excluding meals:
7, 000 kronor.
I don' t mean to offend you, but why don' t you go for the fast?
- Aren' t you going to fast?
- Nope, doctor' s orders.
I need to consume more fat.
I have some kind of scurvy in reverse.
The next time I see my dietician, I' il slug him with a pork loin.
But now it' s time for dessert.
It may be the last one we ever see.
- Scraping my tongue.
It' s supposed to make your breath sweeter, in case you ever get kissed.
- You fall for everything.
- I read about it in a magazine.
- I bought you this.
- What is it?
- A potency patch?
- It enhances potency.
Where do they go, over your eyes?
- That wasn' t very nice!
- Take a look at yourself.
Exciting, huh?
By the way, I did your horoscope.
Don' t make any crucial business decisions this month.
What a load of crap!
Are we living in the dark ages?
Lots of major companies consult astrologers before making decisions.
- Suit yourself.
Good- night.
Let' s slow down a bit.
And then pick up the tempo.
And slow down again.
Changing pace like this in intervals -
- improves your stamina and helps burn more fat.
We do have a regular bike, and the area is very scenic.
I thought we weren' t going to discuss this any more.
By the way, Claes and I are going to fly over to the broiler factory.
- Will you be home for dinner?
- I' il let you know.
Don' t pull anything, like you did with that rowing machine.
You know I don' t like flying.
You should see somebody, try Dr Levander.
Flying' s safer than driving, and I need to rack up mileage.
I have something to show you.
I have a brilliant idea.
This is my idea.
Did you drag me all the way over here to show me chicken feed?
You' re looking at five million kronor.
- What do you mean?
- I' il tell you.
Swedes are getting fat from stuffing their faces with potato chips.
That' s when it hit me...
- Diet chips.
- Diet chips?
People can eat all the chips they want, without the guilt.
What are these chips made out of?
The two tons of chicken feed left over from our broiler factory.
Each bag costs 75 kronor, and that amounts to...... a profit of 9, 925 kronor per bag.
- How do we get people to eat it?
- People eat anything.
We threw a party when I was in college.
We served bowls of "Doggy Delight" and people gobbled it up.
- "Doggy Delight"?
- Dog food, the dried variety.
It' s nothing but a scam, that' s illegal.
No, it isn' t.
I had the crap Camilla bought analyzed, and it' s the same stuff.
It consists of the by- products of fish and some minerals and vitamins.
It' s absolutely brilliant, isn' t it?
Welcome to the health- food business!
What will people think about this hocus- pocus?
And dragging city- folks into the wild for survival training?!
It stinks!
- has booked us solid for four weeks.
Let people talk!
You take care of the kitchen and I' il take care of the rest.
Well, what if Dad had lived to see this?
Well, Dad...
I hope they serve linseeds and bran in heaven.
- Give my best to Camilla.
- Inger...
Do you think you could persuade Camilla to go to a fat farm?
- She' s desperate.
- I' il give her a call.
The chips ought to contain something Japanese, like seaweed.
And a fat blocker, too.
It' s all the rage.
Focus your energy on the factory, before it ruins us.
Never fear!
- Here.
It' s almost time.
- What the hell...?
I thought this was settled, it will give us publicity.
The two top local papers will both be there!
- Don' t be such a stick in the mud.
This display of initiative by Ulla Lundgren -
- has created jobs and put our town on the map...... the true spirit of enterprise that our region needs.
The Gustav Vasa Spa is now open to the public.
Let' s go for some patterning.
- and declare your affirmation out loud:
"I' m safe in the air".
"I' m safe in the air."
- and repeat the affirmation.
"I' m safe in the air."
Do this twice a day, preferably in conjunction with meditation.
I' m not into spacey stuff like that.
Just find a quiet moment.
- How' s business?
- We' re having some ups and downs.
We got stuck with a broiler factory that isn' t going well at all.
But now we' re in the health- food business.
- What about you?
- I can' t complain.
There are phobics, hypochondriacs and people obsessed with their looks.
There' s no shortage of people in trouble.
Bruno and I would like to discuss collaborating with you.
I bought a pair of rubber pants.
- Are you going to take up diving?
- No, it' s to combat cellulite.
- What does Bruno think about that?
- We don' t share a bed any more.
- He says that I snore.
- That you snore?
- I' m glad you' re going to the spa.
- It' s going to be interesting.
But in my opinion, Bruno and Claes should be the ones to go.
- Don' t say that!
Bruno says the only exercise he gets -
- is being a pallbearer at funerals for his fitness- freak friends.
He doesn' t want to be in good shape when he dies.
Well?
"Slim Quick"...
- Who developed it?
- Experts.
- Has it been tested?
It' s been tested extensively on animals.
Diet chips...
It sounds interesting...
Amazing...
Some militant vegans have attacked another meat shipment.
According to witnesses, they were dressed in chicken suits.
You' re lucky nothing like that has happened to you.
- What about your vitamins?
- I' il take them later.
Have a nice time at the Gustav Vasa Spa.
Give my best to Inger.
- but I' ve got a lot of stuff cooking.
That' s right, chicken suits.
Just like our commercial.
Isn' t that something?
I' m on my way.
95% of Sweden must be woodlands.
You sure have a lot of gadgets.
A compass, a thermometer...... a gage for inclines and one for altitude, and a clock.
And according to its reading, we are close to Brännforsen.
- Yes, I know.
- How?
I read the sign over there.
Signs are for cheaters, Stig Helmer.
The Gustav Vasa spa...
Let the torture commence.
Hello, Stig Helmer.
- Hi, I' m Rebecka.
- Did you have a nice trip?
- I got a bit car- sick...
It' s probably psychosomatic.
We' il cure you.
See you later.
Therapy, you say?
Lucky you.
- I always overpack.
- That' s not excessive.
This is just my small suitcase.
- Not to mention expensive.
- We could have gone to Barbados.
- He' s a food smuggler.
- How can you tell?
- I know the type.
Remember the guy who brought roast beef in his dressing case?
Someone even stored pancakes in a container for face cream.
It' s incredible!
I' m Ulla, and I' d like to welcome you to the Gustav Vasa Spa.
We' il start by introducing the staff.
Anna teaches classes in Sacred Dance, Tai Chi and Qi Gong.
Rebecka is our Shihatsu therapist.
And Rainbow is our vegetarian chef.
Linda is our dietician, and composed the drink you have received.
And my brother Nils is a jack of all trades.
We have a few house rules.
This is a drug- free environment.
Toxic substances such as alcohol, nicotine and caffeine are off limits.
We promote life, not death.
- Fasting gives you bad body odor.
- Your body is cleansing itself.
For others, the increased intake of roughage may give you gas.
This is because your body is accustomed to eating dead animals.
This discomfort is reduced by daily colonic irrigation.
Purchase your own personal nozzle at the desk.
Write your name on it so it won' t get lost.
Or stolen.
Back down onto the nozzle...
And then you just turn on the hose.
One last thing, please turn off your cell phones.
- I' d like us to take each other by the hand and sing a song.
That' s silly, it' s not like this is kindergarden.
It' s just a way of getting to know each other, Åke.
Soon you will be eaten
Digested and forgotten
It' s like being able to print your own money.
I' m a genius.
We used to only serve grated, raw vegetables.
- Rainbow has written a cookbook.
- "Esoteric Cuisine".
So Dad' s book isn' t good enough anymore?
Did your dad write cookbooks too?
The recipes are very orthodox.
"Gut Feeling"...
Stocks in high- risk projects in the former East Bloc...... belong down the drain.
That' s all for tonight, we' il be back in two weeks.
- and how the obese are taken advantage of.
The "Diet King" will be featured.
He made millions selling useless pills to overweight Swedes.
Thanks...
I should have put more pressure on that stock broker.
Diet chips...
That guy has been irritating me for quite some time.
Find the manufacturer and analyze the ingredients.
I' m a bit sceptical about these kinds of places.
- Are you a believer?
- A believer?
Do you believe in crystal therapy and horoscopes?
No, but it' s fun to see what places like this are all about.
To rest.
My friend was going to stay here, so I decided to tag along.
What do you do when you' re not keeping friends company?
I own a small outfit... an advertising agency.
"Bramserud Advertising."
- Bramserud, that' s me.
- My name is Inger.
I' m considering retirement, though...
Maybe even take bracing walks.
My ex started taking ten kilometer walks when he turned 40.
And that was the last anyone ever saw of him.
- Are you married?
- Not that I recall.
Possibly married to my work, but we' re getting a divorce.
- What about you?
- I' m unmarried... at the moment.
Good morning.
That looks yummy.
What is it?
A decoction of broccoli.
The new Italian Cuisine, huh?
- What' s this Key Gong stuff?
- It' s Qi Gong.
It' s a Chinese form of gymnastics, like karate in slow motion.
There was an emperor who outlawed martial arts -
- and somebody figured that they could do the same motions slowly.
"Off with your head!"
"I' m gouging your eyes out."
Karate for snails.
If you practise for years, you can use your hands and feet -
- to make incredibly bad movies.
Have you seen Rainbow?
I think he went...... that way.
I think he' s in the vegetable garden.
We live in a universal force field.
- It can be measured with a SQUlD.
A super- conducting quantum interference device.
Your aura is a force field and, as such, attracts energy.
At times, we need to recharge our batteries.
Hugging a tree will do the trick.
Trees willingly share their energy with us.
If you feel embarrased, stand with your back to the tree.
- In your mind, greet the tree.
Picture yourself inside the tree.
- What the hell...?
Feel how the tree gets energy from the sun.
No way...
Tree hugging!
Well, it' s better than nothing.
It' s actually kind of nice.
Give me a hug, Stig Helmer!
Hug me!
Let' s have our first therapy session this afternoon.
- I won' t.
Oh, Ole and I were going to take a Hungarian mud bath.
Then we' il have our session after that.
Don' t forget to take a shower after the mud bath.
I' il prepare a conditioner with lavender and eucalyptus.
I' il also stimulate the acupressure points on the scalp -
- which counteracts baldness in the future.
Slices of biodynamic cucumber -
- flush out toxins and remove wrinkles.
Relax completely.
I' m going to leave you for awhile.
Make the most out of this session and exercise your pelvic floor.
Okay, Boss.
I feel like a sandwich.
Rebecka' s pretty cute...... for a witch.
She looks more like an imp.
Tell me about your childhood.
- What was your father like?
- Like most other dads.
But that isn' t quite true, he was...
- He had a handicap.
- In what way?
He only had one arm.
He and his brother had a band together:
"The Olsson Brothers Dixie Jazz Band".
Henry played the saxophone and my dad was the drummer.
- Even though he only had one arm?
- It worked pretty well.
- That' s understandable.
He invented a gadget.
You' re repressed.
Your body stores these conflicts and makes you tense.
Unexpressed grief and anger turn into a muscular coat of armor.
You really need to release some of that aggression.
Just lay down, like that.
And lift your arms up like this.
What' s this?
I want you to try to push me away.
Here we go...
Come on.
- No...
- Come on, give it a go.
There' s some broccoli stuck in your mustache.
- Come on!
- Stop it!
Say you' re a wimp!
Come on, say you' re a wimp!
Look, Stig Helmer' s getting licked by a girl!
You' re the wimp!
What' s that?
Nothing, I guess...
- Good.
The energy is good.
There' s a lot of aggression bottled up inside you.
You' re an unusual man, Stig Helmer.
You' re an only child, aren' t you?
Did you play ball with the kids in the neighborhood?
Yes, but I wasn' t very good.
If you' re going to be a goalpost, you can' t move around.
- How does it feel to fast?
- I feel a bit dizzy.
That' s because of the toxins that are being eliminated.
I bet you ate a lot of junk food.
Hot dogs, and stuff like that.
Last night I had the strangest dream.
I' m Ole, the king- sized hot dog!
Eat me if you dare!
I' m so wonderfully greasy...
Eat me!
You shouldn' t eat anything that has eyes and can bear young.
- You' re a vegetarian then?
- Fruitarian?
- I only eat fruit.
The richest food I eat is bananas.
But I don' t eat bananas either, for other reasons.
You know, because of United Fruit and pesticides.
- It' s so beautiful here...
Evenings like this make me long to be back in Norrland.
- What city are you from up north?
Those aqua gymnastics wore me out.
Are you going to iron?
What a busy bee!
- What' s that?
- Wait and see.
Presto - espresso!
Great!
I was dying for some coffee.
Right, enough is enough.
That Norwegian guy seems very nice.
What, are you dumping the survival course instructor unseen?
I don' t know...
- Bruno' s on the phone all the time.
- He and Claes are up to something.
Did you know that the Yanks spend 30 times more a year on dieting -
- than the UN spends on fighting starvation.
How' s our project going?
Brilliantly!
30, 000 packages.
Yes.
In my opinion, you' re short on morals and long on imagination.
- It' s against the law!
You have to help, you' re in as deep as me.
Wimp!
- Could you go pick the guru up?
He' s arriving on the two o' clock train.
- What does he look like?
- Oriental, I suppose.
Right, six feet tall and blond.
What do I know?
Make a sign and hold it up.
- I wonder if it' s ball- room dancing?
- Hardly.
Do you like to dance?
I was the Fred Astaire of Oslo some 15 to 20 kilos ago.
- Do you?
- Yes, if I get to pick my partner.
I don' t like it when strange men fondle me like it was their right.
But I can always make an exception...
This is going to be interesting.
Ginger Rogers must have been a better dancer than Astaire.
She did the same moves, only backwards and in high- heels.
Why did you come along if you' re going to be so negative?
And you suggested it.
Good morning.
We' il start out with breathing exercises.
Place one hand on your stomach, and the other on you back.
Take a deep breath -
- all the way down to your pelvic floor.
Envision a string running all the way through your body -
- and passing out through the top of your head off into the cosmos.
You' re suspended on the string, and you twirl upwards to the heavens.
Take a breath...
Relax your arms and let them dangle.
The first phase is the flow.
Each movement is followed by a new movement.
It' s like Tai Chi, an eternal loop.
It goes on and on...
Take a breath.
The next phase is chaos.
Let your feelings out.
- Father no speak Swedish.
- Is he a yoga teacher?
We have come to pick berries.
Gustav Vasa?
This guy thinks I' m the old king Gustav Vasa.
Excuse me...
- Gustav Vasa?
Right, Gustav Vasa.
Don' t close your eyes to the invisible.
He who looks outside is dreaming.
He who looks inside awakens.
Oh, my...
- I' ve never seen anything like it.
- Like what?
Something' s happened to you, Stig Helmer.
Your crown chakra is demonstrating great cosmic energy.
A red aura signifies the seventh sense of change and psychic power.
You' re heading in a new direction.
And you blinked...
- Would you like mine?
- No, thank you.
What goal did you have this week?
I hoped to get rid of this...
I weighed myself this morning.
- I' ve gained 20 grams.
I must be the only person on Earth who gains weight on a fast.
Are you going to do the survival course?
- I wonder what it involves.
I feel like a new human being, not a chicken in days.
- Did you eat too much chicken?
- It' s a long story.
- I' m really dreading this.
- It' s only for a few days.
It' s interesting.
I' ve done it a few times.
- You face the real you.
- I hope she' s skinny.
"Praeparatus supervivat", or "The prepared will survive".
We' il spend a couple of days in the wilderness.
And your only tool will be a knife.
Please empty your pockets and place your belongings in the bag.
Camilla!
- Here' s a knife.
- Thank you.
Anything else?
What is that?
A GPS navigator.
- For satellite positioning.
- Take a knife.
- May I take two?
- No.
We' re going to have an easy run on the river in a kajak.
I suggest that you pair off.
Keep your kajak on course and paddle where the water is most swift.
That' s where it' s the deepest.
Okay, men.
You get to head the expedition.
- Let' s launch the next bunch.
- Move it, Jan.
Good luck!
- It looks pretty unsteady.
- Try to paddle in time.
- Grab the oars, Åke.
- Take it easy.
This is a message from Svensk Hydro.
The power plant at Storforsen will open its floodgates at 1 pm.
This presents a danger to anyone on the river.
Oh, my God!
Here you go.
Hello...
What?!
What are the names of the guys paddling off in the distance?
Stig Helmer and Ole, come back here!
- What' s going on?
- The floodgates are open.
Wait here, I' il go to the rapids.
- There seems to be a lot of water.
- Don' t break the rhythm!
Hold on, Stig Helmer!
No, there' s not a trace of them.
They' ve probably gotten further downstream.
"An easy run", sure!
I' m never going to do this again.
Have the rest of the gang backed out?
That leaves the two of us, then.
Talk about a survival course!
- What' s the challenging run like?
- You don' t get a paddle.
A big steak with french fries wouldn' t hurt right now.
But not for you, you' re fasting.
I' m sorry...
They' il find us soon.
They have heat- detecting cameras.
Lingonberries.
No, these are bearberries.
Arctostaphylos.
This is edible, it' s a fern.
Polypodium.
- Where did you learn all this?
- I was a Boy Scout.
"The Beaver Patrol".
- Are you all right?
- I' m fine.
All that' s missing is the cucumber...
We need to dry our clothes.
Did you happen to learn about making fire?
- will make a magnifying glass.
Then all we need is to gather some shelf fungi.
Fomes fomentarius.
Do you know the Latin names of all kinds of plants?
Just the ones we needed to learn to earn the "Woodcraft Badge".
The police just called.
They couldn' t see them from the helicopter.
If you say "I told you so", I' il throttle you!
The kajak was found at Brännforsen.
That' s 60 kilometers from here!
Here...
- What' s today' s special?
Some sourgrass, chanterelle mushrooms and pine gum.
- And all this is edible?
- The gum is like chewing gum.
It will help ward off hunger pains -
- while the shoots and sourgrass contain a lot of vitamin C.
You didn' t happen to find a bottle of Chablis premier Cru 1982, too?
What a day!
Too bad it wasn' t sunny, we' il have to try the lenses some other time.
I can tell that you enjoy the outdoors.
I liked going on hikes.
I liked going on trips with the Boy Scouts.
I used to play in the forest when I was a kid.
I haven' t seen you this happy for a long time.
But I don' t think it' s all thanks to the forest.
I bet Rebecka has something to do with it, too.
She' s a fun person, but she is a bit odd.
You suit each other.
You' re a fun person, too, but you are a bit odd.
What a strange week this has been.
But they' re out there somewhere...
I think.
Isn' t that typical?
As soon as you meet a nice man, he disappears.
- Body lotion?
- Not exactly, it' s whiskey.
For emergencies.
Did you bring everything?
The cans of spraypaint and stuff?
- Do we have to do this?
- Yes.
Put on your gloves.
Remember, you haven' t seen a thing.
Look, they' il see us with the surveillance cameras.
That' s the point.
- Put your nose on.
- It' s a beak.
Look!
It' s Big Bird!
Well, they' re not exactly minks.
We have to get them out before we blow the joint up.
But weren' t we going to blow the car up?
Come on!
Go spray some message on the truck, that' s what they do.
What are you doing?
- I was gong to write "swine".
- It' s a broiler transport!
Write something like "murderers".
"Smurderers..."
- What should we do with these?
- Stuff them in that bag for now.
Hold on, because it' s going to blow!
What a blast!
I' ve been in the wrong business.
Talk about raising the roof!
What are you fooling around with?
- What are you fooling around with?
- Nothing.
Stig Helmer, wake up!
Listen...
Maybe they' re looking for us.
Wave!
This is a good spot to dump the stuff.
This is a good spot to dump the stuff!
Did you see that?
It might be food.
That yellow stuff looks familiar.
Wake me up...
Aren' t these the suits I bought...?
Somebody up there' s pulling our leg.
Well, at least these are warm and dry.
Aren' t you cold?
Could it make any difference what you wear in a nightmare?
Militant vegans blew up a broiler factory in Österåsen.
The police have no leads as yet.
That would be Bruno' s factory!
Two people appear to have died in the rapids.
Their kajak was found below the falls.
Over to the Sports Desk.
I know they' re alive.
I can feel it!
Blasted mosquitos!
Maybe we should put on the hoods?
Why not?
This must be a dandy of a diet.
- What?
Bramserud & Olsson Botanical Expeditions Inc.
- Should we try that way?
- No, let' s go straight ahead.
Finally, traces of civilization.
The trouble is, which way should we go?
- Let' s go south.
- How would you know that?
I checked out the anthill.
Anthills are always bigger to the south.
You are absolutely incredible, "Beaver".
What a strange country.
There are no berries, just weird people.
Let' s go home!
Do you have any other bright ideas?
Like going north?
Look!
It' s those militant vegans.
Fire a warning shot and I' il call the police.
- Are they shooting at us?
- I sure hope that' s not a bird dog.
You' ve probably seen this man, Dr B. Levander -
- in situations where he can profit from our phobias and hypochondria.
- with the product "Slim Quick".
Let' s consult our panel.
- Rune, you' re a veterinarian.
- What' s do you think of the product?
For chickens that need to gain weight.
In addition to fish by- products, our analysis revealed the presence -
- which prevents parasites in chickens.
Thank you, Rune.
- the owner of Svea Broiler.
- to people who are chicken- hearted and birdbrained.
Down the drain it goes!
Next time...
- I knew it...
- Hush!
I don' t want to hear a peep out of you.
- Anderhage, here.
- It' s about your insurance.
- Terrorist attacks aren' t covered.
- They' re a "force majeure".
- In accordance with item 71.
Tell your CEO that we' re going to appeal.
- You are the CEO...
Idiots!
I' il be going now... to the police station.
To turn the two of us in.
It' s just as well...
And I hope I never have to see you again...... Bruno Asshole!
What a wimp!
This is the police speaking.
Lay face down on the ground with your arms over your heads.
Don' t worry, Stig Helmer.
They probably just want to see some ID.
- Come in.
- They' ve been found!
- I knew it!
- Fine, I think.
They' il be here soon.
Here they come!
Oh, here they come!
- What on earth are they wearing?
- Stockholmers!
They think they' re so superior.
I' m so glad you' re alive.
- But why are you dressed like that?
- I don' t know.
You' il have to ask Ole, but I don' t think he knows either.
We' ve been so worried.
- Why are you in chicken suits?
- There' s no sensible explanation.
Hello, darling.
Guess what?
I' m going to quit dieting forever.
You have to learn to love the person you are, Visnawathan said.
He' s a guru.
How have you been doing?
Just dandy...
Minus 22 kilos, and plus 73 hours of therapy later
- one of the most accomplished disciples of Visnawathan Raj.
Recently returned from a yoga center in Nepal - Krishnamacharays!
Give him a big hand!
He was known previously as Stig Helmer Olsson.
He who looks outwards is dreaming.
He who looks inwards awakens.
Lift your feet, Krishnamacharays.
What' s the Latin name for chickenberries?
It' s "Cornus Suecia".
What about this chubby stonecrop, then?
You don' t know?
It' s called "Sedum".
What' s its name in Latin?
It' s "Sedum telephium".
Wake up, Stig Helmer...
Wake up...
- Good morning.
- Hi there.
- You were talking in your sleep.
- I had such a strange dream.
- What' s the plan for today?
- We should hike to Blåfjäilet.
It' s a great locality for Angelica Arcangelica, Mountain Angelica.
- It' il take us a while...
Don' t worry...
I' il coach you.
(Boy) "You are standing in the cavern of the evil wizard."
"All around you are the carcasses of slain ice dwarfs."
Melt wizard. "
"What do you wanna melt him with?"
- What do ya think I wanna melt him with?
- I told you to take out the garbage.
- Just a second!
"Throw... thermal..."
- (man) Didn' t you hear what Mom said?
(Mom) Joshua Baskin!
"Your hesitancy has cost you dearly."
"The wizard, sensing your apprehension, unleashes a fatal bolt from the ice sceptre."
"With luck, you will thaw in several million years."
Great (!)
(Mom) Come on!
Josh, it' s starting to stink up the place!
OK, OK, OK!
"Take the garbage out."
Every day...
"Take the garbage out." There!
Yeah!
Yeah!
The Yankees' star pitcher is coming outta the bull pen!
They' re going crazy!
- Is Billy there?
- In the back.
Rick Rowden is on the mound for the Yankees.
He looks into the catcher' s mitt, shakes off the first signal, takes the curve.
He wipes the sweat off his brow, leans back and fires.
(Billy) Yeah!
Goodbye, Mr Spalding!
(Billy) Here, here.
Wait.
Got it.
Need it.
Need it.
Do you ever go by Simpkins' desk when she' s grading papers?
When she leans over, you can see right down her shirt.
- I swear to God.
- Bra?
- No, she' s got one of those undershirt things.
So if you get real close to the board,..... you can see all the way down to her flowers.
Gimme your gum.
- Need it.
Got it.
Need it...
(Josh) Oh, my God.
How did a geek like Freddie Benson get a sister like that?
Beats me.
Hi, Josh.
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.
It' s Billy.
- He says hi.
- Come on, Miss Cheapo.
A quarter!
Unbelievable!
God!
She likes you.
I know she likes you.
(both chuckle) (Josh) Call me after supper.
(Billy) Don' t worry!
I' m as interested as you are.
- So?
Will you tell me?
- You' re in.
- What do ya mean, I' m in?
- Cynthia Benson!
- What about her?
- Are you ready for this?
- She doesn' t like Barry any more.
- So?
What do ya mean, "So?"
That' s it - she' s available!
- Billy, it doesn' t mean...
- (Mom) Josh?
It' s after midnight.
- Now say good night to Billy.
- Good night, Billy.
Good night, Mrs Baskin!
- (chuckles) - Sweet dreams!
I' m ready.
One more try.
OK, honey, big smile.
Good.
"Wimpy"!
Oh, better luck next time.
Let me get one more try.
Please?
I can' t live with "Wimpy"!
Are you sure you wanna go on this, son?
- No, I don' t know about this one, Bob.
- No, this looks too scary.
- (Bob) It' s OK.
- Oh, my God!
- I told you.
He doesn' t wanna go on it.
- You don' t have to go on it if you don' t...
I wanna go on myself.
- You do?
- Yeah.
I think it' s something...
- Yeah, I think it' s something I should do.
Why don' t we meet you at the Ferris wheel?
Half- hour.
- (Josh) Excuse me.
(girl) Sal threw up on the other ride.
- (clears throat) - Josh?
- Oh... hi.
Have you been on this before?
- This?
- Yeah.
- Is it scary?
Yes.
Are you here alone?
Yes.
Aren' t those your parents?
- Where?
- Right over there.
Why... yes.
Who' s this?
- Josh Baskin.
- How' re you doin '?
- This is Derek.
He drives.
- (man) Next.
- Go ahead!
- Yo, next!
Read this sign.
- What?
Hey, I don' t make the rules.
Next!
Next!
Well, it' s a stupid rule.
Look, why don' t you try the kiddie wheel?
See you, Josh.
"Drop 25 cents here."
Come on!
Work!
Work!
Neat!
Make my wish...
Right.
I wish I were big.
"Your wish is granted."
Shh.
Come on, come on.
You sleep with me.
Easy, dog!
Easy!
Don' t make me do it.
I' m only part- time.
- (spraying) - Sorry!
Josh!
- (grunts) What?
- (Mom) It' s 7. 30!
- (yawning)
(Mom) Come on, sleepyhead!
You' re gonna miss the bus, and I can' t drive you today!
What does he do in his sleep?
(Mom) Honey?
I put out some clean clothes.
Bring down your dungarees and stuff for the laundry, OK?
(deep voice) OK.
- Are you getting a cold, Josh?
- (high- pitched) No!
He' s got a cold.
Now Rachel' s gonna get a cold, I' m gonna get a cold...
Oh, my God!
- Breakfast is ready, Josh!
- Be right there!
(ripping)
Hurry up!
Your eggs are getting cold.
- Hold this.
Hold this.
Keep it a secret.
Bring down Rachel with you, all right?
OK.
Come on.
Come on.
Quiet, quiet.
- (Rachel giggles)
What about your breakfast?
- Don' t...
Don' t...
I' m sorry.
- No, don' t!
- Mom, it' s me.
It' s Josh.
- I' m a grown- up.
- Stop it!
I made a wish last night.
I turned into a grown- up, Mom.
I made this wish on the machine and it turned me into a grown- up - at the carnival.
My birthday' s November 3rd.
I got a "B" in history.
Here, take the purse.
You can have anything that' s in it.
- (terrified gasps)
Who are you calling?
I have a birthmark behind my left knee.
- You bastard!
What did you do to my son?
- I am your son.
- Where is my child?
Ma!
- Police!
Heads up!
Heads up on defence!
All the way!
(boy # 2) It' s all yours!
I' m open!
Here, I' m open!
(boy # 1) Shoot!
(teacher) Gentlemen, the period is over.
- Get back to the locker room.
- (boy # 2) Billy is a dick!
Wash your shirts and shorts.
Do us both a favour.
Put the balls away, and you practise your lay- up.
Harvitz!
Pick up that shirt or I' il make you eat it.
It stinks!
Let us go.
Now!
- Billy.
- Yeah.
- What?
- It' s me.
It' s Josh.
- Coach Barnes!
- Wait, wait!
- Coach Barnes!
I' m your best friend.
Please, you gotta believe me.
I' il prove it to you.
Billy, please!
- Help!
Help!
- Goddamn it, Billy Francis Kopeche!
Look, I know I don' t look like myself, but something really strange happened.
I' m really scared and I need your help.
You' re my best friend!
Josh?
You look terrible.
I know.
(woman) I was in the house making my gravy and I heard this commotion.
(cop) We' re at the scene right now.
The mother' s pretty hysterical.
It' s not making any sense at all.
There' s no ransom note, no prints - no nothing.
- File a report, to be on the safe side.
Quiet.
- I bet he ran away.
- I wish I could.
You want me to pack your bags?
We go to the city, we lay low for a couple of days.
We find the Zoltar machine, you make a wish.
You' il be home by Thursday.
- Come on!
You' il be fine.
Here.
- Where did you get this?
- From my dad' s top drawer.
- You stole it?
- It' s his emergency fund.
- Jesus, Billy!
- Well, what do ya call this?
Fine!
Fine.
Kill her.
Kill her!
With a knife.
Kill the bitch with a knife.
- Looking for some fun?
- Hey, man.
Can you spare some change?
- No, not really.
This looks OK.
- No, it doesn' t.
- St James, Josh.
It' s religious.
Hi.
Hi.
Um... w- we would like a hotel room, please.
17. 50 a night for the room. $10 deposit for the sheets.
You go straight to the top of the stairs.
It' s the last door on the right.
Next to the bathroom.
Wait a second, I' il show ya.
- (Billy) It smells bad.
- Have a pleasant stay.
- Thanks.
(clerk) Hey, Angel!
Get outta that bathroom now.
- I don' t wanna stay here by myself.
I gotta be home by ten.
I' il cut classes tomorrow.
OK?
Just one night!
All right?
- All right.
- Good.
- What if I can' t sleep?
- It' s probably better if you don' t.
- See ya in the morning.
- Well... you know, like, what time?
8. 30.
(woman) My mother was right!
You' re a pig!
I' d use the chain if I were you.
Mom!
Mom...
- I told you, it' s not a video game!
- Then what is it?
Well, it' s not a video game.
(Billy) This one has a number on it.
- No...
Here' s one.
What are you doing?
- Do you have Zoltar?
I' ve got Power House...
- We need Zoltar.
- I haven' t got it.
- (Billy) This is it.
- They' re not gonna have it.
- Can I help you?
-.. of all carnivals and fairs.
- And arcades.
Carnivals and... fairs...
Uh, try Consumer Affairs.
Down the hall - room 111.
Thank you.
Fill this out in triplicate. $5 filing charge.
- See?
- You get it in six weeks.
- Six weeks?
- Sometimes longer, but you could get lucky.
Next, please.
Fill this out.
I' m gonna be thirty years old for the rest of my life.
Would you come on?
We' il figure something out.
(chuckles)
- So now what?
- I' il come and see you every day after school.
- How?
- I' il tell them I made the basketball team.
- What am I gonna do?
- You can get a job.
- I can' t get a job.
- Why?
What are you good at?
Making spitballs?
- How 'bout a delivery man?
- I don' t know how to drive.
Yeah, right.
Cardiological technician?
Civil engineer?
- You' re not eating your cherry?
- Go ahead.
- Clerical transcriber?
- Billy.
- Gross.
Gr...
- Check, please.
- Go on.
- Collection agent.
Company clerk.
- Computer operator.
Construction engineer.
- Computer operator?
Read that one.
- Will you quit with your stupid computers?
- Just read it!
- "MacMillan Toys..." Toys!
- Toys!
(both) Wiggy- wiggy jazz.
- (phone rings) - MacMillan Toys.
May I help you?
- Are these the applications?
OK, OK, what' s next?
There.
Previous employment.
- Your paper route.
- I don' t think I can put that.
- Paper route circulation director?
- Yeah!
What' s he got?
Hey, don' t worry about it.
Social Security number?
- 32- 17- 25.
- What is that?
- My locker combination.
Great.
Mr Baskin?
Mr Baskin?
- Y- yes...
- The personnel director will see you now.
Uh... your son can wait out here.
(Billy giggles)
Son, you should sit down.
And don' t give the lady any trouble, now.
Sure, Dad.
- This way.
- Don' t forget, look 'em in the eye.
There' s two numbers missing on your Social Security.
Uh... 12.
1- 2.
It says here you' ve got four years' experience.
- All on computers?
Yes.
Where did you go to school?
It was called George Washington.
Oh, GW?
My brother- in- law got his doctorate there.
- Did you pledge?
- Yes.
Every morning.
It happened again!
David, the girl is absolutely useless.
I need someone who knows what she is doing.
Excuse me.
I' m not getting my mail.
Nothing has been filed.
Ever since she got engaged, my life has been a disaster.
She came so highly recommended.
She spent three months writing down her married name.
Mrs Judy Hicks.
Mrs Donald Hicks.
Mrs Judy Mitchelson Hicks - sometimes with a hyphen, sometimes without.
- (snorts)
- Well, I really don' t know where I can put her.
- Put her on unemployment!
- When can you start?
- Soon.
We' il start you off with last week' s preschool orders.
It should take a few days - give you a chance to find your way around.
- Do you smoke?
- Well, just, uh... once.
Only on breaks, and in the coffee room.
Most of that' s pretty straightforward stuff.
Any questions, come to me.
Good luck!
Bye!
"The Dinky Link."
"Seven."
- Psst!
- Psst!
Psst.
- I' m Scott Brennen.
I' m Josh Baskin.
What are you trying to do?
- Huh?
- You gotta slow down, pace yourself.
- Slow.
- Sorry.
- Today' s my first day.
- I know!
- So how long have you worked here?
- Five years.
The work stinks, but the fringe benefits are great.
See that girl over there in the red?
Say hi to her and she' s yours.
She' il wrap her legs round you so tight, you' il be begging for mercy.
Well, I' il stay away from her, then!
Excuse me.
Brennen.
I gave it to you yesterday!
Oh, here it is.
I don' t have time to Xerox it.
- Bullshit!
- But the favourability ratings...
Let' s not lie to ourselves.
If a kid likes a toy, it sells, that' s all.
- But every bit of research...
- It worked in the research, not with the kids!
- Sorry.
- Watch where you' re going!
- Are you OK?
- I am fine.
- You could kill somebody!
- (boss) It' s all right.
The boss should get knocked on his ass once in a while.
- Maybe you should see a doctor.
- For crying out loud, Paul, I' m fine!
- Sorry, sir.
- Where were you going, son?
Oh!
That' s good!
Nothing wrong with a little hustle.
Nothing at all.
Right, Paul?
What did he mean?
I hustle.
Uh, sir?
Sir!
Hello?
- Hello?
- Hello.
- Mrs Baskin?
- Yes?
- How are you?
- Who is this?
Josh is all right.
I mean, he' s OK and everything.
Do you have my boy?
And you' re gonna get him back - just the way he was.
Look, I swear to God, if you do anything to him, if you touch one hair on his head,..... l will spend the rest of my life making sure you suffer.
Wow!
Thanks.
- Let me talk to Josh.
- Oh, he can' t come to the phone right now.
- Why not?
What did you do to him?
- I- I didn' t do anything.
He' s a terrific kid.
(tearful) I want proof that he' s all right.
Uh... all right.
Um... ask me something that... that... that only he would know.
Then I' il ask him for you, and that way, you' il know that he' s OK.
Ask him what I used to sing to him when he was a little boy.
- Is there anything else you' d rather ask him?
- Ask him.
I got it.
Look, you' re gonna see him again - really soon.
I- I promise.
I... cross my heart and hope to...
Uh... we' il talk about this later.
Get down!
Get out of the area!
- Ferris.
- Thank you.
Brennen.
Baskin.
- Payday.
- (man) Hey, whoa!
Where' s mine? - $187?
- Oh!
They really screw you, don' t they?
- Hi.
- Hi.
OK...
So how would you like that?
OK.
All right.
Three dimes, a $100 bill, and 87 ones.
One, two, three...
I' m never eating again.
- It wasn' t that bad.
- It was the boat ride that did it.
No.
It was the pork rinds.
Pork rinds!
- Yeah.
Yeah, we sure did.
Keep away from strange men.
(boy) Gotcha!
- What' s your name?
- Joey.
What' s yours?
- My name' s Josh.
- I' m gonna blow you away, Josh.
- I just got you!
- No way!
That' s bullshit.
Get back here!
(old woman) You big dork!
You work for me, don' t you?
Yes.
I thought so.
Are you here with your kids?
No...
- Oh...
Me, too.
I come here every Saturday.
You can' t see this on a marketing report.
What' s a marketing report?
Exactly.
Come on.
- What do you think of that?
- The championship hockey?
- Ooh, I love it.
Only, the....
- Only, what?
- Well, the pieces don' t move.
- What do you mean?
- Well, on the old set,..... you could slide the men up and down the ice.
Now all they do is spin around.
It was more like real hockey the old way.
Why' d they change it?
I don' t know.
The Starfighters are good - you can change all the pieces around.
But I never liked the Galacticons.
You only get one robot, and there' s no vehicle.
I see.
- Plus, you can' t take 'em underwater.
- And if you do, they...
Neat!
OK, uh... let' s check out the...
- Piano lessons?
- Three years.
Me, too.
Every day - after school.
"Chopsticks".
- What department are you in?
- Computers.
Yeah...
You just saved me a trip to the gym, son.
According to the marketability studies, this thing should go straight through the roof.
Hey!
Watch it, fella.
- Sorry.
Vice president, in charge of product development.
He' s only been here a week!
Vice president?
And he came from Data Processing.
He' s outta his mind.
The old man has finally lost it!
- Bob' s...
Bob' s office is bigger than my office!
There' s gotta be a reason.
Things like this don' t happen without a reason.
- If the president dies, you take over?
- No, they got a hundred of 'em.
Ready?
- Yes, Mr Baskin.
- Thank you.
Come on in.
Look at it!
It' s bigger than the principal' s office.
- How do you know?
- Remember that explosion in science?
- Oh, yeah.
- Track- a- pillar!
59. 95!
You know, that only costs ten bucks to make.
Get outta here!
- What is this?
They just put this in here.
- So what do they make you do for all this?
- Well, I play with all of this stuff,..... and then I go in and I tell 'em what I think.
- That' s it?
- Yeah.
- And they pay you for that?
- Yeah.
Suckers!
Thank you, Miss Patterson.
Miss Patterson!
Could you get Media to send up the video of the Super Bowl?
And have 'em edit out all the commercials?
- Yes, Mr Baskin.
- Thanks.
Miss Patterson.
You' re the luckiest guy I know!
- Did you check Mattel?
- Nothing.
- Coleco?
- Zero.
He can' t come from nowhere, Susan.
How about Hasbro?
Yes, and Fisher Price and Worlds of Wonder.
I have called everywhere.
- Nobody' s ever heard of him!
- Great (!)
Let' s face it, Paul, the guy comes from Data Processing.
(Paul) Terrific!
This is just terrific (!)
You' re being paranoid, Paul.
(Paul) These tests were conducted over a six- month period,..... using a double- blind format of eight overlapping demographic groups.
Every region of the country was sampled.
The focus testing... showed a solid base..... in the 9 - to 11- year- old bracket,..... with a possible carry- over into the 12- year- olds.
- (Josh) I' m sorry... and that we are targeting the same area,..... I think that we should see one quarter of that.
And that is one fifth of the total revenue from all of last year.
- Excellent, Paul.
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- Any questions?
- Not for me.
Yes?
- Yes?
- I don' t get it.
What exactly... don' t you get?
It turns from a building into a robot, right?
Precisely.
Well, what' s fun about that?
Well, if you' d read your industry breakdown,..... you' d see that our success in the action- figure area..... has climbed from 27 per cent to 45 per cent in the last two years.
There, that might help.
- Yes?
I still don' t get it.
What?
- What don' t you get, Josh?
- Well...
There' s a million robots that turn into something.
This is a building that turns into a robot.
What' s fun about playing with that?
- This is a skyscraper.
- Well, couldn' t it be, like,..... a robot that turns into... into something - like a... like a bug or something?
- A bug?
- Yeah.
- In teresting.
- In teresting!
- (Paul) Gentlemen...
- The robot turns into a bug?
- Uh, gentlemen, listen...
- He' s got a very good idea here!
- The robot turns into a bug!
-.. different sizes...
- We could do ladybugs.
- (Josh) You could have 'em wreck buildings.
- A building is inert, a bug moves!
- It' s got all kinds of possibilities.
- This doesn' t just happen.
- Uh...
Well done.
Oh, he is vicious!
- He' s not vicious.
- Don' t kid yourself.
That man is a killer!
- All he said was he didn' t get it.
- (mocking) "I don' t get it."
"Let' s make it a bug."
He' s going for the throat.
He' s trying to eviscerate me.
(frustrated grunts) Did you see the look on MacMillan' s face?
It' s a unique space.
The lines are so clean, and there' s none of that partition quality.
It has 15- foot ceilings, uh... all hardwood floors, ample closet space,..... a modern kitchen, a brand- new bathroom with a jet- stream Jacuzzi.
We' il take it!
Baskin.
Rental delivery.
Come on, come on!
- (splash) - That was so close!
(Josh) "Dear...
Mom and Dad,..... They said..... that I could write you... and let you know I was OK. "
"So far... they' re treating me fine."
"I got enough to eat,..... and am perfectly safe."
I' il get out of here..... in about... a month. "
"In the meantime,..... it' s a lot like camp."
"I watch TV,...
I got it!
I got it!.. and even... get outside..... once in a while. "
"I know... you miss me,..... but try not to worry."
"I think... this experience... might even be good for me."
I' il see you soon. "
"Your son,..... Joshua."
"PS..... Give Rachel a kiss from her big brother."
(piano) (Scott) We got off on the wrong foot.
- I' m having a lovely time.
- I' m delighted, Miss Patterson.
It' s much better than last year.
I just wanted to tell you that.
- Double up on the scotch, will ya?
- Right away, sir.
Susan!
- Love your tux.
I think it' s the same as the maître d' s.
Have you decided what you' re doing on the Danberry line?
No.
I haven' t.
Well, uh...
I think if you got everyone' s input upfront,...
-.. I mean, right from the beginning...
- Susan... have a drink.
- What?
- Have a couple of drinks.
It' s a party.
Oh, God!
Josh!
Glad you could make it.
- I bet he gets another raise.
- Now that' s what I call a tuxedo!
I rented it.
This is a real bow tie, though - I tied it myself.
- That' s why I was late.
- You' re not late.
Let me show you around.
Hey, there' s Miss Patterson.
Hi!
There' s the guy from the meeting!
.. it only works on your hips.
You need a whole 'nother exercise for your thighs.
Hi.
Let me grab a plate here.
Excuse me.
The guy' s a goddamn knock- off artist.
Amphibian?
Oh...
Come on!
(Paul) So I show him the schedule, and he says "It' s not correct accounting procedure."
- The goddamn prick!
- But the toy sold, Paul.
Excuse me.
- Hi.
- Hi.
All the same people, having all the same discussion.
It' s like they cloned some party in 1983..... and kept spinning it out, again and again and again.
- I loved your ideas on the Squeezy Doll line.
- Thanks.
They were so... incisive.
It' s beluga.
MacMillan orders it every year.
Sidle up to him and then ask for a raise.
Gesundheit.
All right?
- (spluttering continues) - Are you OK?
Do you want a glass of water?
- Do you want something to drink?
- Could I have a milk shake or something?
Wanna get outta here?
- Uh- huh.
- Let' s go.
Watch it!
I' m not really a big one for parties.
I like things that are a little more, uh... intimate.
Wow!
Is this your car?
Well, it' s the company' s car.
Oh, this is the coolest thing I' ve ever seen!
Sir.
Just seeing someone in the office, you don' t really get a chance to know them.
- (sucking) -.. of who you are.
- Are you gonna eat these?
- Hey, mister?
You want some of these fries?
No, thank you.
No.
See, it' s hard in a business situation.
I mean, there' s... there' s this invisible line, and, uh..... even if... even if you' re attracted to someone...
- You' re gonna call someone before...?
- (twiddling radio tuner)
Leave the, uh...
Don' t...
I' m really vulnerable right now!
You know?
And I...
- (radio plays "Hot in the City" by Billy Idol) - I mean, I love my job, and... -.. and I...
This is great!
Hey!
Come on up!
- That was my apartment.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- I' d love to see where you live.
Have you always lived alone?
- No.
- Oh.
Is it just recently, or...
- Yeah...
- Give yourself a couple of days, it' il pass.
Well, they said it was gonna take six weeks.
(Susan) Well... it can be painful, but..... that' s what they invented Xanax for, right?
- (Josh) Watch your step.
- Thank you.
I' m not sure we should do this yet.
- Do what?
- Well, I...
I mean, I like you, and I...
I wanna spend the night with you...
D' you mean sleep over?
Well..... yeah!
OK.
But I get to be on top.
- You live here?
- Yeah.
It' s nice, isn' t it?
Yeah...
You, uh... you want a soda?
- A soda.
You want one?
Sure.
I rigged this up so you don' t need any quarters.
Oh!
No... no, don' t.
- What?
- The glue is not dry yet.
Sorry.
- Sorry!
- It' s OK.
You didn' t break anything.
- You wanna play pinball?
- You don' t need quarters for this either.
- No, thank you.
OK.
- Is that a trampoline?
- Yeah.
You wanna try it?
No!
You should.
It' s really fun.
It' s simple, too.
Come on.
- You' il like it.
It' s easy, too.
- Do you have some wine?
- Take off your shoes.
- Maybe we could talk for a few minutes.
Jesus!
Gimme the other one.
OK.
Now watch.
It' s really simple.
Let me just get my big balls off here.
I' il watch.
It' s fun!
I' il do it with you.
Excellent.
- Help me up?
- Sure.
OK... jump.
- You want me to jump?
- Yeah.
Just jump.
- There.
Now we can have a drink.
- No, no, no, no, no!
Really jump.
Stand here and get in the air and all...
Go ahead.
Get some air between you and the tramp -..... oline.
- There.
- Oh, come on!
I' il do it with you, all right?
Ready?
Come on.
OK, jump.
Just this - that' s all there is...
That' s all there is to it.
Good.
Good.
There you go.
There you go.
Yeah!
It' s easy!
Anybody could do this.
Hello!
How do you do that?
Good!
Hi.
- Here.
- What?
- Pick one.
(giggles) OK, try again.
That one.
It' s for you.
It' s a glow- in- the- dark compass ring, so you won' t get lost.
Good night.
(Paul) Had fun last night?
Yeah.
- Yeah...
Yeah, you left pretty quick.
- I gave him a ride home, Paul.
Did he enjoy it?
- Don' t be ridiculous.
- That' s me, Mr Ridiculous (!)
Mr Silly Old Guy!
I don' t feel like going out tonight.
What do you mean?
They' re your friends.
I know.
- (retunes radio) - Leave it!
Will you quit it?
- (Paul retunes radio) - You have to play with everything?
Baskin?
Baskin?
Wouldn' t you rather play basketball?
We could be a team for the MacMillan company.
- No.
- My best sport' s video hockey.
- It' s not a sport.
- It takes eye- to- hand coordination.
- It' s not a sport if you don' t sweat!
- What about golf?
That' s a sport.
- Yeah, a machine doesn' t do all the work.
- What about car racing?
- Ah, shut up, Baskin!
- What are the rules again?
I told you.
Over the line on the serve, yellow is out of bounds, play to 21.
Ready?
Sorry...
Sorry.
- One- nothing!
- Hold it.
Attaboy!
- Yeah.
- That was in.
Two- zip.
Just made it.
Two- zip.
Ready?
Here we go!
That was in.
Good.
Point.
- (Paul) What' s the matter?
Backhand.
Yes!
- 19- 18.
- That was under the line.
- What?
- You said it had to be over the line.
- No, I didn' t.
- You said it had to be over on a serve.
No, I did not!
Now gimme the goddamn ball!
- That' s cheating!
- Gimme the goddamn ball, will ya?
- No.
- Gimme the ball, you little shit!
- It' s my serve.
- Gimme the ball!
- Gimme the goddamn ball!
I never said that!
- Yes, you did.
Gimme...
Gimme the ball.
Gimme the ball!
Give me the ball.
- You' re a cheater.
- I do not cheat.
Give me the ball.
Give me the ball!
Gimme the...
Gimme the ball!
All right.
But let' s take it over.
We' il take it over!
- He didn' t have to punch me.
- I know.
He' s scared of you.
- You don' t play his game.
- I tried to play his game.
He beat me up.
If he' s scared of me, then why did he punch me?
He punched you because he' s scared of you.
- I don' t get it.
- It' s just the way he is.
Everything' s a fight with him.
Everyone' s an enemy.
It' s not just a job for him, it' s a war.
Then how come you' re so nice?
What?
You work as hard as he does and you' re not like that.
You don' t know me that well.
Yes, I do.
You' re one of the nicest people I' ve met.
How do you do it?
- What' s this?
- Shampoo, razor, toothpaste,...
-.. two ties and an exercise tape.
- Susan...
Oh, and I want my keys back.
Sure.
He' il get over it.
It' s nothing to do with him.
- He' s just another link in the chain!
First it was, uh, Tom Caulfield, then Hanlen, then Golding, then me.
- Am I missing somebody?
- It' s not like that any more.
What is so special about Baskin?
He' s a grown- up.
Susan...
I can' t believe you brought up Golding.
Catch.
Catch the dough.
Catch.
How many pieces of dough we got here?
Here they come!
Throw me the ball.
My God!
He got it!
He' s really good!
- Happy birthday to you - (Billy) Surprise!
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Josh
Happy birthday to you
And many more!
(waiter) Happy birthday to you.
- Hey.
What are you gonna wish for this time?
I know, we can get some beers, some dirty magazines...
I can' t, Billy.
- Of course you can.
It' s your birthday.
- I have to go somewhere.
Where?
Well, I have to go meet somebody, and...
- You got all night.
- Yeah, I know, but...
See, I just...
Well, I can' t right now, OK?
But I' il call you, all right?
OK?
I' il give you a call.
Oh, and thanks again, Billy.
It was fun.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Do you wanna come in?
- Sure.
Sit down.
- Yeah!
Yeah.
Wanna go again?
They have cars that you can drive, except they' re on a rail.
- Like a coaster ride.
- So you' re not really...
- You have a big gob of mustard right there.
- What?
- Mustard.
- Where?
Right there.
- Well...
Well...
Here.
- That... gone?
- Yeah.
- Listen.
Oh, music?
Wanna dance?
Dance?
- We don' t have to if you don' t want to.
- OK.
- All right.
- OK.
- Mm- mm.
We could get some hot chocolate.
You can wear my jacket if you want.
(nervous laugh)
What were you like when you were younger?
- Oh, well, I wasn' t much different.
- (laughs) I believe that about you.
I' ve been thinking about you a lot.
It' s... crazy.
In my car,..... lying in bed...
I' ve just never gone out with someone like you.
With all the other men, there was so much to hide.
I feel like I can tell you anything.
Susan?
Susan...
There' s something I think I should tell you.
What?
You want the light on?
- Good morning, Mr Baskin.
- Good morning.
Hey, Brett, how are ya?
- Hi, everybody.
- (woman) Hi, Josh.
Josh, my man!
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Good morning, sir.
- I' d like some coffee, please, Miss Patterson.
- But you don' t drink coffee!
- And, uh... make it black.
You know, you two should come to Vermont.
It is so pretty up there right now.
- (husband) We spent our anniversary there.
- All you did was watch TV!
I popped popcorn, too.
We watched that intellectual stuff, you know.
Did anybody see that great documentary about Columbus on PBS the other night?
- (Susan) Mm- mm.
- (woman) Um, no.
- I had no idea he had a fourth ship.
- Yeah, the Santa Cristina.
- That' s right.
- He only had that on his second trip.
- You saw it, too.
- No.
- But I- I used to... study, you know, that stuff.
- Really?
I need some help with my algebra.
- Not now, Adam.
- Yeah, but, Dad...
- Adam, we have guests.
(Mom) He has had the roughest time with algebra.
- We' ve tried tutors, everything.
- With algebra?
- I used to study that, too.
- (Mom) Isn' t that nice?
Let' s say Larry Bird' s gonna score ten points in the first quarter.
- How many will he score in the whole game?
- 40 points.
- Probably, OK?
And that' s algebra.
- Right.
- But, it is...?
- Yeah.
Just as four...
You' re right.
He' s wonderful.
I know.
"Department of Consumer Affairs"?
Yeah, buddy!
It came!
(executive) He' s never done this before.
Get the art department on the phone.
Get them, get them!
- Send out for some sandwiches.
- Cajun or deli?
Maybe next year, Brian.
Next year.
- You can do it.
- I cannot plan a whole line!
Why?
Nobody knows more about toys than you.
Susan, doing that means marketing and strategy and stuff like that!
- I can' t...
I' il handle the marketing.
- But...
- Come on, it' il be neat.
I don' t know.
I don' t have any ideas for new toys or anything.
Yeah, well, tell him I called again.
- (Miss Patterson) I' il tell him, Mr...
K- O- P...
- You know, he' s been very busy.
- Yeah, right (!)
Well, tell him it' s important.
See, it won' t be like these, where you just follow the story along.
You would actually make a whole different story appear, just by pressing these buttons.
An electronic comic book?
That' s amazing!
Like a living comic book.
It' il be different every time.
This is incredible.
You' re brilliant.
If you like one, you could see it over and over and over again.
You' re wonderful.
Do you really like it?
- Really?
- Really.
- You think Mac will like it?
- I think...
You know what we can do?
We could do, like, sports comic books,..... where, like, if you' re going to steal second or something like that.
We could have sports books - baseball, football...
What...
What...
Huh?
What' s going on here?
Well... you know, we' re...
Something wrong?
- You don' t like it?
- No!
No.
It' s...
I mean, if it' s an affair, that' s one thing.
But if it' s...
If it' s something else...
Not that we have to know right now.
But if we think that it could turn into something else,..... well...
How do you feel about all this?
How do I feel about what?
Well, how do... how do you... feel about me?
What is that supposed to mean?
Wednesday would be better than Thursday.
- Mr Baskin can' t be...
- Yeah, I have the key example right here.
Where you been?
I' ve been trying to reach you!
I' m in the middle of something, OK?
- I got the list.
- Can you give me a minute, please?
Yes.
This is it.
This is the list!
Would you come back at lunch?
I' m a little bit busy right now.
- Hello?
- Busy?
- Billy!
- Are you outta your mind?
- Jesus, Billy!
Miss Patterson!
- It' s what we' ve been waiting for!
I got work to do, can' t you understand that?
I got a deadline to meet.
I' m your best friend.
What' s more important than that, huh?
And I' m three months older than you are, asshole!
"You are standing in the cavern of the evil wizard."
"All around you are the carcasses of slain ice dwarfs."
"Melt wizard."
"What do you want to melt him with?"
"Throw thermal pod."
- (woman) Boys!
- (boy) Just five more minutes.
Josh?
What' s wrong?
What is it?
I haven' t told you something because I didn' t think you' d believe me,..... and I didn' t think you' d like me any more, so...
Oh, honey, come here!
You can tell me anything.
What?
Susan, I' m not what you think I am.
What do you mean?
Um...
I was in Little League,..... and I rode my bike to school, and I played with my friends and hung out...
Josh, what are... what are you talking about?
I wanna go home.
I miss my family, Susan, and I wanna go home.
Oh, my God!
You' re married!
- No!
No...
- I knew this was too good to be true.
- There had to be something!
Susan, I' m not married.
- You' re not?
- No.
I' m a child.
What?
I' m a child, Susan.
I' m...
I' m not ready for all of this!
Oh, that' s fine.
That is...
That' s just great (!)
- What happened...
- No, I understand.
- "I' m not ready to make a commitment."
- No!
No, you don' t understand.
I' m 13 years old.
- Oh, and who isn' t?
You think there isn' t a frightened kid inside of me?
No, I mean I really am thirteen!
I went to bed one night and I was a kid, and when I woke up, I was a grown- up.
Oh, right (!) And just yesterday, I was a schoolgirl with pigtails (!)
- Why are you doing this?
- There was a carnival...
- Please!
- I made a wish on the Zoltar machine.
Oh, stop it!
The Zoltar machine had this bobbing head that looked just like a devil!
I did!
I made a wish to be big.
What I' m trying to tell you is, I changed into a grown- up, but I' m really just a kid!
Fine, Josh.
You' re a kid.
Look, I don' t know what it is that you' re trying to tell me,..... but we have a very big presentation to give tomorrow, so I' m gonna get some sleep.
Stupid stuff!
Dumb stuff!
Some friend!
I don' t need him.
Stupid jacket!
Josh?
Josh!
Hi, Mrs Baskin.
Hiya.
I was just looking around in here.
- Your hair' s getting longer.
- I got it cut yesterday.
He had a birthday.
I know.
He' il be coming back real soon.
Everything' s gonna be OK.
- I hope so.
- Good night.
Right there!
Sea Point Park, New York.
Well?
- Yes?
- (Miss Patterson) They' re waiting for you.
Thanks.
See you around.
There' s this flat screen on the inside with pictures on it.
You read it, and when you get to the bottom, you have to make a choice..... of what the character' s gonna do - if he' s gonna fight the dragon, you push a button.
- Paul?
- I don' t get it.
- Well...
- (Mac) Paul!
- It' s a comic book...
At the end of a page, you decide where the story goes.
- That' s the point.
- Terrific, Susan.
- (Susan) The kid makes his own decision.
- (Mac) This is possible?
Yeah!
In fact, it' s a very simple program.
Isn' t that right?
(Paul) So what happens when you run out of choices?
(Susan) That' s the great thing.
You can sell different adventures.
Just pop in a brand- new disk, and you get a whole new set of options.
- (Susan) Mm- hm.
I' il be right back.
(Mac) How much would the unit cost?
Well, our initial figure was around, uh... seven..... around seven dollars,..... with a retail cost of about... 18. 95.
Well, you expect a kid to pay $19 for a comic book?
I think a kid...
Will you excuse me?
Josh?
Josh!
Will you take me to Sea Point Park, New York?
Sea Point Park?
Josh!
- Not so fast!
- Here.
Josh!
Josh!
See you back home!
Yeah!
Excuse me.
You know Josh?
Yeah.
- Look, you have to tell me where he went.
- Who are you?
- I' m...
- I' m his girlfriend.
- Billy Kopeche.
- You have to tell me where he went.
Please, tell me.
Tell me!
Work, damn it!
- Josh?
- Susan!
You know, you don' t walk out on somebody.
You don' t do that!
I know.
I' m really sorry.
I' m really sorry, but...
I...
I didn' t know what to say.
Oh, God!
You got your wish.
- I tried to tell you...
- I didn' t listen.
- I tried to tell you. -.. or want to!
Even if I did listen...
- I' ve been thinking about this.
I' ve been...
There' s a million reasons for me to go home, but there' s only one reason for me to stay.
What reason is that?
Well..... you!
Come on.
Come on, come on!
So, uh... what are you?
Fifteen?
Sixteen?
I' m thirteen.
Well, that explains it!
Maybe you could come with me.
No!
No...
Why not?
I' ve been there before.
It' s hard enough the first time.
You know what I mean?
You don' t know what I mean.
Come on, I' il drive you home.
- I' m sorry.
- No, I' il be OK.
You' il be fine.
In ten years, who knows?
Maybe you should hold onto my number.
So this is where you live?
- Which one is it?
- That one right there, just... (Susan) Oh.
That' s nice.
I' m gonna miss you.
I' m gonna miss you, too.
- You won' t even remember me.
- Oh, yes, I will.
Mom?
- Mom!
- Josh?
- It' s me!
- Josh?
Josh!
Oh, my God!
Oh, thank God you' re home!
Oh, Mom...
I missed you all so much.
- (Josh) I' m just not good enough.
- What are you talking about?
You hit the ball over the fence almost every time in stickball.
- (both chuckle)
- (Josh) You really think I could do it?
- Yeah!
- (Josh) Come on, we' il hit some after supper.
I' il call for ya.
Arnie, {y: i} have some chicken.
{y: i} I don' t want {y: i} any chicken, Gilbert.
{y: i} You want some corn?
- "Have some corn."
Mm- mmm.
- Hmm?
Are they gonna come soon?
'Cause I gotta go back home, you know?
Pretty soon.
I want them to come.
- No.
Ok.
They' re gonna come soon, huh?
How many more miles till they come, Gilbert?
Ok.
That' s them, huh?
It' s them!
{y: i} Ahh.
They' re coming.
Honk your horn!
{y: i} My brother Arnie' s {y: i} about to turn 18.
{y: i} My family' s planning {y: i} a big party for him.
{y: i} Watching the campers {y: i} is our yearly ritual.
{y: i} They' re doing the right thing {y: i} just passing through.
Oh, God, Arnie.
No.
- [Engine Sputters]
- You' re getting littler.
You' re shrinking.
You' re shrinking.
{y: i} Endora.
{y: i} Endora is where we are.
{y: i} Describing Endora is like {y: i} dancing to no music.
{y: i} It' s a town where {y: i} nothing much ever happens, {y: i} and nothing much ever will.
{y: i} Lamson' s grocery {y: i} is where I work, {y: i} and miles out of town on the interstate, {y: i} there' s Foodland, {y: i} where everyone else shops.
{y: i} This is where I live with my family.
{y: i} My dad built the house, {y: i} and it' s my job {y: i} to keep up the repairs.
{y: i} Doctors said we' d be lucky... {y: i} if Arnie lived to be 10.
{y: i} Well, 10 came and went, {y: i} and now the doctors {y: i} are saying any time now.
{y: i} Arnie could go at any time.
{y: i} Some days you don' t.
- What is it, buddy?
- I killed him.
I killed him, Gilbert.
I know.
{y: i} My older sister Amy {y: i} is more like a mother.
{y: i} She used to manage the elementary school {y: i} cafeteria over in Motley, {y: i} until it burned down last year.
{y: i} For days, she' s been walking {y: i} around going, "Ooh, ahh," {y: i} like she can' t believe {y: i} the feel of teeth.
{y: i} I got another brother, {y: i} Larry, but he got away.
{y: i} And then there' s Momma, {y: i} who, in her day, {y: i} was the prettiest girl in these parts.
{y: i} Ever since our dad was hung out {y: i} to dry 17 years ago, {y: i} Momma' s had her hands full.
{y: i} You see, with Momma, there' s no nice way {y: i} to break it to you.
{y: i} She hasn' t left the house {y: i} in over 7 years.
- I need your help.
Garbage.
Where' s my sunshine?
I don' t know, Momma.
- Ok.
Gilbert, get him down from there.
{y: i} Hurry.
Let' s go.
- Amy, you seen Arnie?
{y: i} Nope.
Wonder where he is.
Gee, I don' t know.
Ellen, you seen your brother?
He' s in the tree.
{y: i} Ellen, he is not in the tree.
{y: i} Isn' t that right, Gilbert?
Yeah, that' s right.
Come here.
Yeah, you were up in the tree.
- No.
- "Arnie:
Thank you and goodbye. "
- "Gilbert?"
Something going on at Foodland?
I wouldn' t know, sir.
I' d rather die.
Foodland' s up to something if you ask me.
It' s those lobsters, isn' t it?
Scads of lobsters all in a tank.
You know, you shouldn' t worry about it.
It' s just a phase.
- You think?
Oh, yeah.
The way you say that makes me think I' m talking to your father.
Can I have these two, Gilbert?
No, just one.
- Sure.
Go ahead.
- Say hello to Momma.
{y: i} Gilbert?
Mrs Carver needs a delivery.
Could you?
- "Hello, Gilbert."
- "We don' t want to."
We don' t want to. "
{y: i} All right.
Arnie, get back in the truck.
- Ok.
I was counting.
Hey, kids, let' s play.
{y: i} Come on, boys.
Soon.
It is melting.
Oh, my God.
- Come on up here.
{y: i} You don' t want to?
{y: i} I want a pool.
- "You want a pool?"
- Come on up here.
Gilbert was just making a delivery.
Come here for a second.
- Here.
Really.
I insist.
You deserve it.
Thank you.
Bye.
Gilbert?
Come by my office.
We need to talk.
- [Siren]
Come on down.
- "Arnie, get down!"
We' ve had enough fun for one day.
Hey!
- "Come on down."
{y: i} I' m going up there!
Son, come on down.
- "I' m going to go up there."
- Arnie!
- Gilbert.
Hi.
Come on down.
I' m going high!
- "It' il be getting dark soon."
Hey, Bob.
Yeah, here we go again.
{y: i} Basically, I don' t like {y: i} to work on carburettors, and I can tell without getting into it... that that is a complicated unit.
Look.
See, it' s this little guy right here.
I need a new one.
- "Yes, ma' am."
I can order it.
- About how long would that take?
- A week?
Whoa!
My shoe done fell off.
{y: i} My shoe done fell off, Gilbert.
I know a boy whose name is Arnie {y: i} He' s about to turn 18 {y: i} and have a big party {y: i} I know a boy whose name is Arnie
Come on down, buddy.
Match in the gas tank, boom boom
Match in the gas tank, boom boom
Match in the gas tank, boom boom {y: i} Good boy.
Come on down, buddy.
{y: i} Come on.
Thanks, Jerry.
Good boy.
I' m taking him home.
I promise it won' t happen again.
We hear this every time.
Then he' s right back up there again.
Yeah, but this is the last time, right, buddy?
- It' s the last time.
Come on.
I want to go back up there again.
- Hey, Arnie, good job.
- Don' t touch him.
{y: i} Do it again for me.
Get out of here.
- Could you help me out later?
- Yeah.
- The electricity?
Maybe.
- Bye.
- I' il come by later.
Ok.
Arnie...
Arnie disappear.
I disappeared on Mom like that.
- Just let him go.
Gilbert, bring the milk.
Get food.
{y: i} Are we ready to {y: i} talk about the party?
{y: i} Ellen' s in charge of decorations.
{y: i} Theme colours.
That sounds pretty good.
The cake.
- "Arnie, I' m making something" {y: i} very special for you.
{y: i} And, Momma, you can {y: i} supervise everything.
- "Ok with everybody?"
- "That' s disgusting."
What about me?
You are the guest of honour.
Gilbert, what about me?
It' s my party.
That' s your job.
{y: i} All you have to do is turn 18.
- Huh?
- You don' t have anything to do.
- No, I don' t.
{y: i} Yes, you do.
I' m almost 16, {y: i} and I got pages of ideas.
{y: i} You haven' t done anything.
- "Stop it, Ellen."
{y: i} He never does anything!
Can I please be excused?
- "We' re planning this as a family."
- Really?
- "Which is no big deal," because all Burger Barns are built identical.
{y: i} They just ship 'em out.
It' s so efficient, it' s amazing.
{y: i} In the matter of a couple days, {y: i} there can be a whole new restaurant there.
{y: i} I was driving past {y: i} the building site today.
You know, it' s going up... right down the road from Foodland.
The general manager was there, so I says, {y: i} "Can I fill out an application?"
{y: i} He said, "You bet you can."
So I did, and it looks really good.
I might be wearing one of them uniforms, flipping some burgers, salting some fries.
{y: i} It could be the best thing {y: i} that ever happened to me.
I saw her!
I saw her!
- What?
You know what you did.
That' s your mother in there.
Your mother.
I know.
I just don' t get it.
Ok.
Gilbert, run now!
Bye- bye.
I' m not tired yet, Gilbert.
Ok.
Goodbye.
Yeah.
Goodbye is for when you' re going away, and we' re not going anywhere, are we?
Jeez, I know that, Gilbert.
See you tomorrow.
We' re not going anywhere.
- Goodbye.
- Yeah, I do.
I got to come back.
- She' s fat.
Come on, man.
- She' s not all that big, Gilbert.
I saw a guy at the state fair... who was... a little bit bigger.
A little bit bigger?
- She' s not the biggest I' ve ever seen.
- Take her out for a walk.
- Take her out for a jog.
Hey, Bobby.
- Give her a chance.
Hey!
Nobody' s dying.
That' s good.
I mean, this is good.
That' s a good thing for you to do.
If you' d give it a chance...
I just was saying... that it wasn' t something I should be doing.
They use canola oil, ok?
{y: i} Probably don' t even sell it {y: i} at Lamson' s grocery.
It' s cutting- edge.
It creates a crispier French fry... and a more unique product.
Forget Wendy' s, forget Burger King, forget McDonald' s.
That' s, like, old hat.
Burger Barn is cutting- edge.
{y: i} It' s an innovative place.
{y: i} They created the salad bar, which is now mimicked by every single fast- food chain in America.
They came up with that.
{y: i} 15 different toppings for each salad... {y: i} and two kinds of lettuce, {y: i} and it' s all that you care to eat.
- "Look at the little fellas."
- "You mean my hoppers?"
- For my friend.
There you go, my boy.
What do you say, Arnie?
Thank you.
This Thursday.
Ok.
I' il need a delivery later.
Have a nice day.
{y: i} Gilbert?
Gilbert?
He' s behind the chips.
- Excuse me?
{y: i} She' s going to be {y: i} needing some help.
- Is that your bike?
- Yes.
Don' t worry, I' il do it.
- I got it!
{y: i} I did it by myself.
Look at that.
- "Shh.
Arnie, no. "
Excuse me.
Oh, just keep going straight.
All right.
My mom wants me to become 18.
I' m having a big... a big party, huh, Gilbert?
Yep.
- When' s that party coming?
6 days and I become 18.
I' m 18, and you' re not invited.
Arnie, don' t be rude.
{y: i} Oh, it' s ok.
{y: i} I don' t mind.
I got the groceries.
Be careful with 'em.
I got 'em, ok?
Oh... no, Arnie!
I' m really sorry.
Don' t worry about it.
I' m really sorry.
- "I' m sorry."
- "Don' t be sorry."
Are you sorry?
- No.
We' re not sorry.
I' m not sorry.
That' d be good.
You know those little Vienna sausage things?
{y: i} You use grapejelly {y: i} and ketchup for a sauce.
- I want hot dogs, Mom.
You know, like those Hawaiian appetizers.
You get pineapple chunks out of the can... {y: i} and wrap them with bacon {y: i} and put toothpicks through them.
- How do you cook the bacon?
- In the oven on a pan.
But the bacon won' t be crisp... if you bake it in the oven on a sheet.
- And nobody wants greasy, floppy bacon.
Momma, I want hot dogs!
We' re going to have hot dogs, honey.
- I promise we' re going to have hot dogs.
- "Ellen.
- What?
- Excuse me?
- You' re making me sick.
I' m going to throw up.
Ok, Dad.
- Sure thing, Dad.
{y: i} Amy:
Will you two cut it out?
Sure thing, Dad.
- "Momma:
{y: i} I can' t believe you said that!
- Dad' s dead!
- "Arnie, shh."
{y: i} Arnie, stop it!
Amy, make him stop.
Dad' s dead, Dad' s dead, Dad' s dead!
Stop it, stop it!
Amy.
2 x 10s and the 2 x 12s, and the space between 'em here... is... should... they' re right now at 2 feet, and this should be 16 inches.
See this here, flat flooring?
Flat flooring' s, like, once the wood gets old, you' il just fall right through it.
{y: i} Yeah, I guess daddy {y: i} wasn' t much of a carpenter.
{y: i} Hey, Gilbert, why did he use {y: i} 2 x 6s instead of...
Tucker.
- Shh.
- Oh, sorry.
She' s coming.
You ok?
Fine. "
Thanks a lot for coming by.
I' il come by tomorrow with the wood.
Let' s just keep it quiet.
I' m in.
See you.
I think she' s asleep.
- Gilbert, what are you doing?
- Sorry, Momma.
Jeez.
{y: i} I made up that bed for you.
What for?
Just in case you wanted a change.
- I' m happy right where I am.
- Yeah.
- "This great product" {y: i} at this great price.
Here you go.
- Goodnight, Momma.
- You' re so helpful.
{y: i} - That was it.
She...
I don' t know.
Their car broke down or something.
I can see it in your face...
Change the subject?
We want a pool.
- "You' re telling me later."
- I' il tell you everything later.
Look at those guys out there.
They' re all happy... {y: i} and waving to their friends.
{y: i} But the next day... {y: i} And this is the thing that {y: i} they don' t know... {y: i} They could be... lying on the slab.
It' s kind of, uh, harsh... but it' s kind of fun, too.
- What?
{y: i} Be tempted, like... well, fool around with the bodies?
Oh!
No, I always wanted to ask.
I' m sorry if it makes you uncomfortable.
The worst thing that we do is we take the bodies, the grotesque ones, the really, really ugly ones...
We make jokes about them, you know, harmless jokes, {y: i} very harmless jokes, {y: i} but we come up with some... {y: i} some very good, good jokes... about them, my father and me.
But, you know, they' re dead, and, uh, nobody can see that.
- Hi, Mrs Carver.
Nobody knows we make them.
Gilbert, I' m waiting for your call.
- "How' s she doing?"
Ah.
Bye.
He wants... he wants to kill you, right?
{y: i} You prefer a bronze casket?
Gilbert.
- What?
- "Can somebody give me" {y: i} a hand with the wood?
Uh- uh!
Go help Tucker in the basement.
Why don' t you go into the basement?
I don' t want to go down there, Gilbert.
No way, no way, no way!
{y: i} You go down there, Gilbert.
Hey.
Whooo!
- Aah!
- "Arnie, shut up!"
Shut up.
It' s not funny!
Get back here!
Don' t worry.
Those are 2 x 6s, and there' s six of them, so... you know, those could hold anybody.
I forgot.
What?
I forgot that down there' s where your dad...
Yep.
I' m sorry.
Don' t worry about it.
- "No, Arnie, no!"
Arnie, you' re not!
Arnie!
Not again!
Get down.
Get down!
You' re not going anywhere!
{y: i} Not too much fun, is it?
{y: i} But I want to go up there!
Aah!
Ellen, no!
I told you don' t touch him.
He was going to climb it again.
I don' t care.
Just get out of here!
Let me see.
You made him bleed!
What does Gilbert say?
If anybody ever hits you... or even just lays a finger on you, what are you going to do, Arnie?
You' re going to tell me, and then I' m going to take care of it for you, right?
And why will I take care of it?
- Hmm?
'Cause nobody hurts Arnie, right?
Want to pick out some candy?
- What do you want?
- What?
- We' ve got to do better.
Are you listening to me?
And you... you have to stay here.
You don' t go anywhere.
- Don' t go anywhere.
We' re not going anywhere, you know?
Where you going?
I' m waiting... waiting for that call, Gilbert!
Hi, Gilbert.
- Oh, look.
- What?
You know how they mate?
The males sneak up on the female, and she' il bite off his head, and the rest of his body will keep on mating, and then when they' re done... she' il eat him.
She' il eat the rest of him.
Grandma, we have company.
So, do you want to eat?
- Oh, thank you.
Wow.
Well, we missed the rally in Des Moines.
{y: i} If we get on the road by Friday, {y: i} we' il make Colorado Springs {y: i} in time to catch them.
- "Have you ever been to Colorado?
{y: i} It must be wonderful.
It must be incredibly frustrating, then, to be stuck here in this place.
- This place is as good a place as any.
- "Think so?"
{y: i} Well, she should know.
Becky' s been just about everywhere there is to go, {y: i} places I didn' t even know existed.
{y: i} [Laughs]
Me, I spent most of my whole life... in the same spot.
{y: i} Why doesn' t matter.
Anyway, she encouraged me to get out.
Now she can' t stay put anywhere.
Isn' t she?
Isn' t she beautiful?
{y: i} [Giggling]
Oh, yeah.
I' m not into that, that whole external beauty thing, you know,
- 'cause it... it doesn' t last.
- you' il get grey hair.
- Sure.
You know, so what?
- Mm- hmm.
Yeah.
Sure.
So what do you want to do?
There' s not so much to do here, really.
You can think of one thing.
Think of one thing that people do here.
Thank you.
It was nice meeting you.
Be nice.
- Hi.
Can I have yours, and I' il give you mine instead?
The one on top is fine.
No, we want the big one!
Let' s go.
- Here you go, guys.
Yeah, that' s fine.
{y: i} Oh, it' s changing.
That' s what' s wild about the sunset.
It' il just... change... {y: i} really, really slowly {y: i} in front of your eyes.
I love the sky.
limitless.
It' s very big.
Big doesn' t even sum it up, right?
That word big is so small.
{y: i} You have to get {y: i} those really giant words... to describe the sky.
What?
It' s kind of a family thing.
{y: i} Do you want me {y: i} to give you a ride back?
No, actually, I' m just going to sit here.
I can come back, and...
- Yeah.
You' il be here then?
Yeah.
All right.
I' il be back in a little bit.
Come on.
Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.
Where' s the duck?
Find him!
- Where' s the duck?
Find the duck.
I don' t have time for this.
Lift up.
- Duckie.
You know what?
You' re such a big boy.
I bet you could do this all by yourself if you really wanted to.
I' m a big boy.
Take this.
- Take this.
And your robe is there.
The big boy' s going to wash himself.
- I got to go.
You missed it.
What did I miss?
- The sunset.
Oh... oh, well.
- I' d like to see where you live.
- No, you wouldn' t.
Come on.
My parents split up when I was a kid.
- 'cause they' re always moving.
It' s my life.
We don' t really move.
I mean, we' d like to, but... my mom is sort of attached to the house.
I guess not the right word.
She' s pretty much wedged in.
- What do you mean?
- That' s it.
That' s the house.
{y: i} It' s really amazing... {y: i} I mean, how small it looks from here, considering the... girth of what' s inside of it.
- Yeah.
That' s my mom.
What about your dad?
Some other day.
I had a nice time... tonight.
I know.
Good night.
{y: i} Oh, no.
Oh, Arnie.
Come on.
You' re ok.
You' re ok, buddy.
Get warm.
{y: i} Oh, God, I' m sorry.
I' m sorry, buddy.
Would somebody please explain?
Gilbert' s in charge of bathing.
- No more baths.
But you didn' t.
No more baths, Momma.
No.
Where is your head?
- "Gilbert!"
- Sorry, Momma.
{y: i} Sorry isn' t good enough.
- You' ve got to do better.
- "Got to do better."
- Hey, boss?
Is that the right price?
That' s right.
- Seems like it ought to be more.
- "Maybe at Foodland."
Here.
- "Gilbert, got a delivery" {y: i} for you, son.
- "It sounds urgent."
Go outside and play right now.
Hurry up.
- "Hi."
My hands are all...
Oh, yeah, sure.
- How have you been?
- Good.
- Mmm.
Who' s the girl?
It' s ringing.
One sec.
This is good.
Mmm.
It' s, uh, ringing.
One sec.
Hello?
- Mr Carver.
- Who is this?
- Gilbert?
- Did you?
- No.
How many times do I have to ask, and still no visit?
Well, I' m here now.
Happy anniversary.
- [Fly Unzips]
We should meet man to man.
Yes.
- What about now?
- [Moans]
- Is that a yes, Gilbert?
- Ok.
- Bye.
Do you want him to kill me?
I' m just playing.
Don' t... don' t you want to play?
This is crazy.
I, uh, I got to go.
- You don' t have to go.
- "Yes, I do."
It' s that new girl, isn' t it?
He wants me to come to his office right now.
If you walk out that door... {y: i} don' t you dare walk out that door.
You look nervous, Gilbert.
{y: i} I' d be nervous, too, if I were you.
I' d be downright panicky.
{y: i} I reviewed your file.
You' ve got no major medical insurance, {y: i} no catastrophic... no life.
{y: i} Gilbert... what if something were to happen to you?
Something unforeseeable, something sudden, random.
- An accident, maybe.
- What about your family?
- "[Ring]"
Think about them.
You don' t want to leave them empty- handed.
Look, can' t this wait?
I' m in the middle...
{y: i} Please calm down.
No... no,
I...
{y: i} Go on, go on.
I' il...
I' m on my way.
Troubles at home.
I' m sure you understand.
Betty' s got the car.
Gilbert, could you give me a ride?
Oh, my God, Betty!
What the hell' s going on here?
Doug?
What' s going on here?
I don' t believe this!
{y: i} Oh, great!
Cookies.
Let' s go show your mom the cookies that she' s baked for us.
This is great.
They taste fine.
A little burned on top, but just fine.
They' re wonderful.
Boys, here, have some of Mom' s cookies.
But...
I chose you.
- "I' ve got you a real pool!"
Come here.
Come here.
{y: i} Get inside this pool, you rotten...
- "Get inside the pool!
- "I give you all I have!"
I knew you' d always be there because... because I knew you' d never leave.
We' re all going to enjoy it!
I can' t do any better!
(Niles) Calm down, dear.
Take a left, then the second right, then a left again.
- OK.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
- ls Maris lost again?
She wandered into the kitchen by mistake.
I had to talk her back to the living room.
Any chance of getting a table?
They got their check five minutes ago, but they´ve been sitting there ever since.
- I shoot them dirty looks, all in vain.
- Show me the look.
They´re there for a while.
- Shall we order?
- Why not?
- What are your coffees today?
- Zimbabwe and Kenya.
- Ooh, l´il have a Zimbabwe latte.
- l´il have a Kenya cappuccino.
So what´s new?
The gardener finally won the battle of the wills.
He got Maris to dig up her camellias so he could put in that Zen garden.
- lt´s beautiful.
The perfect place for meditation.
Yesterday I found Maris sitting in the lotus position.
Good for her.
lt´s bringing out her spiritual side.
She was reading Danielle Steele and making a nail appointment on her phone.
Do you realise that it´s a year since I moved from Boston?
Really?
It seems like yesterday Dad moved in with you.
People can have opposite impressions of the same event.
Look at them.
Sitting there like they own that table.
- Let´s both give them the look.
- lt´s worth a try.
- It worked!
- Niles, l´il never doubt you again!
Try the look on that table.
l´m going to the men´s room.
- Maddening!
- What?
The moisturiser dispenser in the gents.
The cream is too oily, so I re- washed.
And then the hand dryer breaks down.
How do you get through the day?
- Thank you.
- Did I say decaf?
- No.
Oh, l´m sorry. lf I drink the regular stuff, it´il keep me tossing and turning through my brother´s conversation.
Nobody´s leaving.
Let´s take a table outside.
Why not? l´m feeling al fresco.
Oh, how does Mrs Fresco feel about that?
Must be a riot on camping trips.
- Would you like a...?
- No.
Now that chapter two of your life is in full swing, can I ask you something?
- Sure.
- Are you happy?
- Did you hear the question?
- Yes, l´m thinking.
- No, it´s not.
- Either you´re happy or not.
- Are you?
- No, but we´re not talking about me.
Let´s not gloss over that.
Why?
I was watching PBS the other night - a documentary on the Great Depression.
Poor people escaping the Dust Bowl, their meagre possessions on rickety, old trucks heading to their ´´salvation´´.
You see this scruffy little boy being handed a new pair of shoes.
Frasier, if you could have seen the look on that boy´s face.
It was a look of pure and utter happiness.
I have never experienced that kind of happiness in my life.
Not even when I bought these $400 Bruno Maglis.
- Do you like them?
- Very nice.
- What about the tassels?
- l´m not a tassel guy.
Neither am l.
Nevertheless, there they are.
I have no reason to be unhappy.
I have a wonderful home, a beautiful wife.
- Did your eyebrow just move?
- No.
I have my practice.
But l´ve lost the ideals that led me to psychiatry in the first place.
Who am I talking to?
Psychiatry´s answer to the drive- through window.
Sometimes I wonder if l´m not just in it for the money.
Oh, I wouldn´t say that´s true.
Oh.
- What were you going to say?
- l´d rather not.
There´s no need to.
I know what you´ve wanted to ask me for years: did I marry Maris for the money?
I resent that!
I did not marry Maris for the money.
- It was just a delightful bonus.
- So you really do love her?
Of course I love her!
But it´s a different kind of love.
You mean, it´s not human?
I mean, it doesn´t burn with the passion of a Tristan and lsolde.
lt´s more comfortable, more familiar.
Maris and I are old friends.
We can spend an afternoon together, me at my jigsaw puzzle, she at her Autoharp, not a word spoken between us, and be perfectly content.
l´m told it was a lot like that near the end in the Hitler household.
Let´s shift the subject back to where it belongs.
Just answer.
- Well...
- (Roz) Hey, guys.
- Hi, Roz.
- What are you doing here?
I always wanted to fly a jet, and today they´re offering a special on jet- flying lessons.
I came here to get coffee.
Thanks for stopping by.
l´d have been mad if you didn´t.
l´m also meeting someone here.
A man?
- Yes.
The new guy from the news department caught me checking him out.
- He was bent over the water fountain.
- Love at first sight.
He said, ´´Let´s get some coffee and get acquainted. ´´
l´ve got a strange feeling that this guy might be the one.
You say that about every guy you meet.
Yeah, I guess.
You know, I don´t think he´s here yet.
- l´il go snag a table.
- Good luck.
- Bye, Roz.
- I don´t think she likes me.
- It isn´t a question of liking or not liking.
- She despises you.
I warrant such strong emotions?
I barely acknowledge her existence.
You may be on to something there, Sherlock.
She is comely in a back- alley sort of way.
She´s very attractive.
- Did you ever think about you two...?
Oh, no.
Never fantasised about stealing away to a motel with her?
l´m a man with normal urges, and she has a silk blouse that opens a bit when she leans over the cart rack, but...
Oh, mixing work with romance...
ls it ever worth it?
Don´t ask me.
- Decaf Zimbabwe latte.
- ls that non- fat milk?
- No.
- I hate to be a bother.
lt´s just that l´m watching my fat intake.
ls that rain?
- No, God is crying.
Do you ask any other kind?
Hey, how the hell did she get a table?
There!
Oh, good block!
Sorry!
Good work there.
I just wanted it a little more than he did.
Oh, boy, it´s really coming down.
What?
Something happened the other morning.
You know what he said?
- He said, ´´What´s the magic word? ´´ - You´re kidding!
He didn´t find it amusing when I said ´´rest home´´.
That must be Roz´s coffee companion.
Wow, he´s really handsome, isn´t he? ´´Wow´´?
Did you say ´´wow´´?
Good Lord, I did.
I don´t think l´ve ever said ´´wow´´ describing another man before.
Does that mean something?
It means you´re a gay man.
Your life with Maris is a charade.
Come out of the closet.
You want to tell Dad or shall l?
This was stupid!
Admit it.
No!
You needed exercise.
It was stupid to come out without your bumbershoot.
lt´s an umbrella!
Speak English!
Sorry, no dogs allowed.
- What?
- Oh, l´m sorry.
lt´s OK.
- Oh, Niles?
- Hello, Dad.
- What are you two doing here?
- I felt we needed some exercise.
I had to pick up some beans anyway, so we walked.
Well, one of us was dragged by his collar.
I told you I didn´t want to come.
Look at me, l´il die of pneumonia.
You´il outlive us.
The cranky ones always do.
Let´s get you something hot to drink.
You want a cappuccino or...?
- Can I help you?
- Coffee, black, nothing fancy in it.
We have two special coffees today...
l´il surprise you.
Oh, joy.
There´s nothing like the smell of a wet dog to work up the appetite for supper.
- We´re soaked to the skin!
- You´re in a fine mood today!
- You left a mess in the kitchen.
- I had toast!
Yeah, and you buttered it on the counter.
I know because you left crumbs and toast sweat there!
- Toast sweat?
- Yes, yes.
When you put hot toast on any surface, it leaves drops of dew.
Haven´t you heard Dad´s lecture on the evils of toast sweat?
lt´s the scourge of our times!
One coffee, black.
And a decaf, non- fat Zimbabwe latte.
Oh, dear, is that cinnamon on that foam?
As long as we´re picking each other´s scabs here,
I found Eddie´s chew toy in my sweater cubby.
Hair all over my favourite pullover!
He sleeps in there!
Because you keep sweaters in a ´´cubby´´.
Well, my bedroom is off- limits to this flea bag.
- How about those Mariners?
Shut up, Niles!
lf my hip´s good enough to get me here, maybe it´s time I found a place of my own!
- Where will you go?
- Don´t worry. l´il find a place.
l´ve got a little money saved up.
(Dad and Frasier) ´´l don´t want to be a burden to anybody! ´´
That´s Frasier´s smartass way of telling me he´s heard this.
You won´t have to hear it again.
Tell Daphne to catch up with us.
We go through this melodrama every week!
Sit down!
- No.
How much for the coffee? - $1. 50.
For coffee?
What kind of world are we living in?
You were in that bathroom forever.
I tried that damn hand cream.
l´m so oily, I couldn´t grip the doorknob.
When some guy came in, I said, ´´Am I glad to see you! ´´
I can´t even begin to describe the look he gave me.
There it is.
So, l´m told you and your dad are at it again.
What´s new?
Lately, he´s had a face as long as a wet weekend.
Yesterday, when I insisted he do his stretching exercises, he told me to stick me feet behind me head and spin like a top.
The best thing to do is to ignore him when he´s like that.
lsn´t that right, Niles?
Niles?
For some reason, l´m feeling a little dizzy.
- l´il go after him.
- Oh, here.
- Take my bumbershoot.
- That´s nice.
At least someone appreciates my mother tongue.
l´ve always had an ear for your tongue.
What did I say?
- Want another coffee?
- Not until l´ve had my first one, thanks.
Why is it always so difficult between me and Dad?
Look at it from Dad´s point of view.
As a policeman, he had authority.
That´s been taken away.
Criticising the world, he controls his shrinking sphere of influence.
I do empathise with him. lt´s just...
I can´t help wishing to kick that cane out from under him sometimes and that he would land on Eddie.
- lt´s hard.
I know you´re trying.
- I am.
Sometimes, I see the fruits of my labour.
The other night, Dad was watching TV.
l´d fallen asleep on the couch.
I felt something on my head.
Dad was standing there, stroking my hair.
Dad?
Did he say anything?
Yeah, he said, ´´Don´t you think it´s time for a haircut?
You look like Bozo. ´´
I know he was covering.
What do you think?
- Wouldn´t hurt to get a trim.
- Do you think he was covering?
- Of course.
You know Dad.
Tough as nails on the outside, but on the inside, one giant spike.
What about mine?
We have a team of specialists working on it.
Let´s change the subject from Dad and talk about something else.
- Yes, about something light and frothy.
- I agree.
Are you in love with Daphne?
That´s a little frothier than I had in mind.
That is preposterous!
I refuse to dignify that question with an answer.
I don´t know.
There, I said it!
Are you happy?
Why did you have to hire Venus herself?
Why not a beefy, Eastern- European scrubwoman who reeked of ammonia?
I asked, but it was an Olympic year.
The agency was fresh out.
Frasier, I can´t get her out of my mind.
Daphne stirs a passion in me l´ve never known before.
- You´re not considering leaving Maris?
I suppose the situation you´re in is that you´d like to stay with Maris but have an affair with Daphne.
Can I do that?
- No, you can´t.
I thought that I couldn´t, but you got my hopes up there for a minute.
Oh, it´s easy for you.
You´re free, you´re happy.
You haven´t answered that question yet.
- I haven´t?
- No, you haven´t.
Are you happy?
Well, I guess the best way I could think of saying it is...
- This sucks.
- What´s the matter?
lead you to something like, oh, I don´t know, a life?
Suddenly, the trapdoor opens and you´re right back in Roz´s world.
- Simple.
He just wanted to convert me.
I have nothing against religious people.
l´m ecumenical.
I embrace men of all faiths.
lf only it stopped there.
He pretended it was a date. lsn´t there a commandment against that?
No, they didn´t go into dating until the New Testament.
Roz, l´m sorry.
Why don´t you join us?
No, thank you.
There´s a cute new handyman in my building.
l´il just go home, slip into a negligee and rip out my faucet.
You think she´s kidding, don´t you?
I think about Roz´s life, and it makes me wonder about my own.
I haven´t been exactly burning up the social scene lately.
- You´il find somebody.
- But what if I don´t?
What if I end up old and alone?
I might have to buy a funny little dog and move in with Frederick.
I don´t have to worry about that for a while.
Frederick should worry about that.
You might try answering my original question: are you happy?
I guess l´d have to say...
- Hello, boys.
- Oh, for Pete´s sake.
- Dad, what are you doing back here?
- I don´t know, I...
l´ve been acting like a jerk lately, and taking it out on you and Daphne.
All that stuff I said earlier, forget about it.
- I already have.
- Come on, Eddie.
Dad, listen, has something been bothering you the last few days?
- No, no.
- Come on.
- Nothing.
- ls something bothering you?
- Just say it.
OK.
Last Sunday was my birthday.
Of course it was.
Frasier and I planned a big surprise party, but on your birthday it wouldn´t have been a surprise.
Thus we waited a week.
So, surprise!
Oh, if you could see the look on your face.
Just give it up, Niles.
Dad, l´m sorry.
- Come and have a seat.
You know, I don´t know why I let it bother me.
All those years on the force, I missed enough of your birthdays.
We can still celebrate.
We´il take you out to dinner tonight.
- Absolutely.
You name the place.
OK.
- Oh, great!
Great!
They were voted best bratwurst in town.
l´ve been on Third Street looking for you.
I was on Fourth Street.
Eddie had smelled everything on Third.
- How did you know I was here?
- One of me psychic flashes.
Bang!
You were apologising for the way you´ve treated me this week.
l´m sorry about that.
Just forget about it, all right?
And something about a raise...
- You´re winging it now.
- Am I that transparent?
No, l´m psychic.
The boys are taking us out to Hoppy´s Old Heidelberg for dinner.
Oh, great.
German food!
We whip the Jerries twice this century, and they still have the last laugh.
Dad, sorry, I can´t give you a ride.
- l´il give him a lift.
l´ve enjoyed getting together with you for coffee.
- What do you talk about all the time?
- Sports, chicks, monster truck rallies.
OK, don´t tell me.
Zimbabwe, decaf, non- fat milk, no cinnamon in sight.
Now...
Are you happy?
You know, in the greater scheme of things, yes, l´d say I am.
Take him down!
That' s it, that' s it!
Lynn Swann.
Now, why ain' t I surprised... to see you snoopin 'around my football field first day of practice?
Well, that' s because you got a good- lookin 'football team.
Maybe good enough to add another national championship trophy
That' s kinda like my old man told me one time, Lynn. to the old case downstairs.
"The only thing better than a crawfish dinner is five crawfish dinners."
Hey, here comes the shithead.
It' s clean.
It' s cold.
Ooh!
Right in the head!
any unused magic in that legendary green playbook of yours, Red?
I may have a couple squirrelled away in there... for a rainy day.
[players Yelling]
See what we got here.
- Not exactly what I' d call constructive criticism.
- Smell like you could use a shower, stinky.
- [Whistle Blowing]
Listen, you- you could think what you want a- about my personal hygiene, - Oh! but, please, don' t- don' t waste any water.
That- That' s bad policy. lf you need to amuse yourself at my expense, just- just rough me up or something.
- [Groaning]
- [Sighing]
[Waterboy Mumbling]
Laski, get over here!
- Yes, sir, Coach?
What is that moron doin 'here?
Didn' t I tell you as plain as I could speak to get rid of his ass last year?
Yes, sir, but I didn' t think you were serious, Coach.
Disrupting my football team, you idiot?
Eighteen years of this is enough!
Hey, Waterboy!
Yes, Mr Coach Beaulieu!
Okay.
Get out of the way, you moron!
* My papa said, son don' t let the man get ya *
Bobby Boucher, come give your mama a kiss.
- Hi, Steve.
Why you home so early, my precious angel?
Mama, s- somethin 'bad happened today.
Somebody hurt you, my boy?
You tell Mama who hurt you.
Nobody, Mama.
I lost my position as the team' s water distribution engineer.
Why, that' s the best news I heard in a dog' s age.
Now you be able to spend your days at home where you belong.
Yes, but --
l- I was -- I was thinkin ', Mama, maybe l- I could --
I could try to- to get another waterboy job for- for a different team.
Don' t you raise your voice to me, Bobby Boucher.
l- I wasn' t raising my voice, Mama.
I don' t like confrontation 'cause I' m a Virgo.
Who told you you was a Virgo?
Vicki Vallencourt, that- that- that- that girl. a girl?
Bobby Boucher!
Don' t you remember what your mama told you about girls?
- Really?
- We looked for crawfish together.
Her' s name' s Vicki.
- Why not, Mama?
- Because little girls are the devil!
Mama, it- it' s just that I' m a waterboy.
The team gets thirsty, and I bring them the water.
They- They need the water, and I likes to be the one that brings it to them.
Yeah.
They like to give you a boot in the patoot for all your trouble.
Bobby, you don' t have what they call "the social skills." people don' t understand you.
That' s why you never have any all I know is this, Jimmy:
Next Friday, august 29, friends, except for your mama.
I' m gonna open a can of whoop- ass on Herculon, at the Baton Rouge Exposition Center, and I' m gonna drive him back into whatever galaxy it is he came from. and that' s a promise!
Strong words from a strong man, Captain lnsano.
Now let' s take a call.
Hello, Jim.
l- ls it possible to speak to Captain lnsano?
- Captain lnsano,
I notice sometimes when you are wrestling -- or- or openin 'up a can of whoop- ass, as you like to say --
- you seem to be sweating quite profusely.
I was wondering if, perhaps, you might need...
- Yeah? the services of an experienced waterboy.
[Chuckling]
Eleven, twelve?
l- I am 31 years old.
Oh!
This is where they strip the ball from us. and then we miss one tackle.
There, two tackles.
Joey drops the ball.
- [Sighing]
- Hello?
- My name is Bobby Boucher. and I am inquiring as to whether you have the need for on your upcoming season.
l- l- l- It was my daddy' s.
- Yeah.
Come here.
Come here.
Come on.
Come on, everybody. - all right, this is it.
Okay?
The quarterback.
Two receivers lined up to the left, one to the right.
There' s a flanker lined up to the left behind the quarterback.
- He gives the ball --
No, he doesn' t get the ball.
Once the quarterback has the ball, he fakes to the left.
No.
He fakes to the right.
He doesn' t fake.
He pretends to fake.
I don' t know where I am.
I can' t breathe.
Or, this room is getting smaller.
I have to sit down.
Take some water.
This is good.
This is much better than what I serve.
- That is the water that you serve to your players?
- Uh- huh.
I can' t hire anybody with the --
You do not have to -- have to pay me.
l- I will do it for free.
Just promise me that you will never distribute the contents
- That' s a deal.
Thank you so- so much, Coach Klein.
l -- I will not let you down.
- Good day.
l- l- I' il see you at practice.
- * Boom, boom, boom, boom * - [Yelling]
* Bang, bang, bang, bang *
* Boom, boom, boom, boom *
* Bang, bang, bang, bang Hey *
* Hey **
Quit hoggin 'that. pass it over.
Just have the defence run sprints.
Water' s better cold.
It' s like my mama always says, "Better safe than- than sorry."
My mama says that too. aren' t all mamas the same?
- Yes.
- Derek.
Will you listen up?
I need your cooperation.
ls he gonna be- be all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don' t worry.
He' il snap out of it.
- Let me know when it cools down, baby. all right.
Hey, did you all get a load of the new waterboy?
Let' s make him feel right at home.
Jerry, go right.
Way left.
Break!
Red, 22!
Red, 22!
Hut!
- Hey, Waterboy, check this out.
Hey, Waterboy!
- [Grunting]
- [Grunting Continues]
Well, he spit in the c- c- cooler.
[Echoing]
Do you understand me? - are you all right?
- What?
I wasn' t gonna
You gotta defend yourself here, Bobby. do nothin ', Coach.
But they' re- they' re- they' re finely tuned athletic machines.
I am not telling you to go on a shooting rampage.
But you have to stand up for yourself, or they' re
Believe me, I' ve seen it myself. gonna ride you all season long.
Moron!
[lmitating Bobby]
L- Look at me.
Duh!
I got a wooden spoon.
Smell like you could use a shower, stinky.
You' re fired!
Stop makin 'fun of me.
Red, ready!
- Damn!
Who that?
Who there?
So that' s what openin 'up a can of whoop- ass feels like.
Son, you just opened a whole case of whoop- ass.
I would be honoured if you play football for this team.
- Me? play football?
- Yes.
My mama won' t let me play no football.
You and I, we' re gonna talk to Mama.
M- Mama said -- M- Mama said -- My mama said -- Mama said --
- My mama said -- My mama say that -- - She' s gonna say yes.
[Zapper Buzzing]
Mmm, that snake looks delicious.
What part do you think I' m about to eat?
Uh, basically a snake don' t have parts.
But, uh, if I had to call it anything,
I would say it' s his knee.
His knee.
and what are we having for dessert?
- Squirrel.
Excellent.
Let' s talk about Bobby playing football.
I don' t like it, Mr Coach Klein.
You see, my boy is too delicate to be playin '"fool' s ball" -- or whatever you call it -- with them gargantuans.
I don' t think you understand, Mrs Boucher.
No, you don' t understand me, Mr Coach Klein.
- [Steve Braying]
It' s the brain pain, Coach.
You see, my husband Robert, one day back in 1966, pick up sticks, and me four months pregnant with this precious angel.
He decides he wants to go and help the foreign peoples.
He' s gonna go and join the peace Corps. and he promise me that everything' s gonna be okay.
Just like you promisin 'me now.
But everything wasn' t okay.
He got lost in the middle of the Sahara Desert. and he died.
He died!
- Couldn' t get no water, Coach.
He died of the dehydration.
I would' ve gotten my daddy some water, but I was just a little baby - and we were left all alone. and now you wanna take away the only part of my Robert I have left. inside Mama' s stomach.
But don' t you want the only part you' ve got left to get a college education?
- Nah.
Yes.
Bobby, think about it. a whole new world will open to you.
Boy, Mama, that- that- that sounds nice.
Me- Me, a college man.
Coach, my Bobby' s a sweet boy, but he ain' t exactly what you' d call "college material," so don' t you go fillin 'his simple head with all those crazy dreams... of school and college and things of that sort.
But Mama, l- I' m tired of everybody callin 'me a dummy.
I' m- I' m tired of not havin 'any friends. and my ass is tired sittin' here jawin 'all night.
I' m goin 'to bed.
Nice to meet you, Mr Coach.
Good luck with your fool' s ball.
- [Door Closes]
- You know, when I was your age, my mother told me not to get a tattoo... of Roy Orbison.
But what Mama don' t know won' t hurt her.
I trust you' il make the right decision.
* Huh I' m *
- * Sooner or later * - Damn, I don' t want that ass
Everybody' s already laughin 'at us.
We ain' t won a game since 1994. - * Sooner or later ** - Hey!
What' s up, baby?
- Where' s your helmet?
You can share mine.
Try it on, man.

- Thanks, friend.
- What a dink.
Come on!
- [Coach Klein] all right,
[lmitating Bobby]
Ooh, I' m a f- f- football player.
- Coach, I' d like to tackle him right now, please.
[Grunting]
- Not yet.
- Special teams, go with Farmer Fran, do some laps.
Third and ten.
Third and ten?
Yeah, you know, that' s the offense' s last opportunity... to gain ten yards before they have to punt.
Gee, he' s gonna run the option.
- [Grumbling]
- He ain' t never gonna be able
Yes, he is.
Now, Bobby, you' ve waterboyed for 18 years.
Didn' t you occasionally watch the game?
- Checking the pH levels, refillin 'the cups.
Well, then let' s just keep it simple. - all right.
like you did Gee yesterday.
- Right now?
- Does he know about this?
Bobby, Bobby.
He' s resilient.
He' s a resilient guy.
Hey, Casey, I think he wanna make out with you.
Thank you.
ls there any sport that you do watch?
You know, a physical sport?
Wrestling!
Wrestling is good.
Who' s your favourite wrestler?
Well, even though he was slightly discourteous to me recently,
I' m gonna have to say Captain lnsano.
- [players Gasping]
- He poked me in the eye.
- Captain lnsano shows no mercy.
Bobby, where was the intensity that I saw yesterday?
That was no intensity.
You said it was all right to fight back, and l- I just started thinkin 'about all the people who- who' d
That' s it.
That' s it. been mean to me over the years.
I want you to think about all those mean people.
- They' re gonna be your tackling fuel.
- We' re gonna use them to play football.
- Tacklin 'fuel.
I want you to pretend that Casey...
- is insulting you. - pretend?
I want you to visualize all those people that have been mean to you. and then I want you to attack.
I want you to visualize and then attack.
- Can you handle that?
He' s gonna try.
What' s the matter with you, boy?
You too s- s- stupid... to do what your coach tells ya?
- No!
I didn' t mean to hurt you.
Coach told me to pretend.
Bobby!
Can you do this?
Coach, not only will I do it for you.
l- l- l -- Yes, yes, I' il do it for ya.
[Chattering]
So, uh, why you pick this class anyway?
It' s pretty hard.
Oh, beautiful view.
Correct. all right, all right!
Y' all shut up now!
Now, last week, we talked about... the physiology of the animal brain... as it pertains to aggression.
Now, is there anyone here that can tell me why... most alligators are abnormally aggressive?
- I know the answer to this question.
- Raise your hand. anybody? anyone?
Yes, sir.
You, sir.
Mama says that alligators are ornery...
'cause they got all them teeth but no toothbrush.
Yo mama said, alligators are ornery 'cause they got all them teeth... and no toothbrush.
Wow! anybody else?
Yes, sir.
You, sir. alligators are aggressive because of an enlarged medulla oblongata.
It' s the sector of the brain which controls aggressive behaviour.
- That is correct!
The medulla oblongata.
The medulla oblongata... is where anger, jealousy and aggression come from.
- No, man. - anyone?
No, Colonel Sanders, you' re wrong.
Ooh!
You' re all wrong.
Mama' s right.
Mama' s right!
It' s okay to fight back.
Coach Klein said I could.
Mr Coach Klein said I could.
[announcer]
Well, Mud Dog fans, it' s time to kick off... another year of Mud Dog football.
With the weight of a 40- game losing streak on their back, everyone seems to be diggin 'in for the long haul.
* There' s blood in the streets It' s up to my ankles *
* There' s blood in the streets It' s up to my knee *
* Blood on the streets in the town of Chicago *
* Blood on the rise It' s following me **
What you doin ', Bobby?
That' s an early warning sign of the dehydration.
You gots to have H2O. - please, for me.
Here.
Now, just do whatever you did to Colonel Sanders, and you' il be fine.
l- I will, thank you. l- l- I just -- I feel bad about lyin 'to my mama.
I wonder what she' s doin 'right now.
- The Mud Dogs offence takes the field.
You can do it.
Gain some yards.
Hey, Walter, I' il bet you 50 bucks... put some points on the board.
You owe me 50 bucks.
- You said it was gonna be a touchdown pass, you crazy asshole.
Okay, you can do it.
Come on.
Bobby, Bobby, this is just like we practised, okay?
Come on.
- Time for retard to find out what college football' s all about.
Red, 18!
Needle dick!
- I knew that this was a good idea.
- Time- out from the game.
- What' s he calling time- out for?
Bobby!
Yeah, man!
- Slap hands!
Waterboy' s killin '' em.
He' s the best tackler I' ve seen since Joe Montana.
Joe Montana was a quarterback, you idiot.
I said, "Joe Mantegna."
30 seconds to go in the fourth quarter.
- I' il be playin 'with your mama tonight.
Bernard drops back.
- [Cheering]
Sixty- two!
- [Groaning]
Number 62 is headed for the end zone.
He' s at the 40, the 30.
Touchdown!
Looks like Boucher knocked him out cold.
Now you know that.
- [Crowd Moaning]
What an idiot.
Waterboy, you stink!
Nice job, shithead.
You just lost us the game.
I' m sorry.
Would you please still be my friend?
Get away from me.
May I help you?
Hey, stud.
Vicki Vallencourt, this is -- this is quite a pleasant surprise.
Yeah, well, I just got out of jail, and I heard you were playin 'football.
[Bobby]
[Mumbling, lndistinct]
So, let' s say we go and get somethin 'to eat, catch up on things.
Mama' s not a- a- a big fan of restaurants... or of- of me going to one.
But if- if you' d like, sometimes,
Mama, she, uh -- she like to -- on a Sunday afternoon --
There- There' s a- a- a grill with the charcoal b- biscuits.
- You want me to come to a barbecue?
- Yes, that' s it.
Sounds great.
and by the way, I hope you like what I did to y' all lawn mower.
[Steve Braying]
You know that old hag that does astrology on Good Morning america, she really ought to pack it in.
Listen what she said for Sagittarius.
She goes:
"You' re gonna be faced with a difficult decision today."
But the thing is- is- is, we' re all faced with difficult decisions every day.
- That' s like sayin 'you' re gonna eat today. by leaving her predictions vague and generalized, - Yeah, m- maybe... there' s less of a chance of someone findin' out she' s a phoney.
Whatever, college boy.
Here comes Mama.
- Oh, okay.
[Sighing]
- Mmm, here you go, Vicki Vallencourt.
- Thank you.
Mama, Vicki' s an astrologist.
You sure played great yesterday, Bobby.
- What did my boy play great?
Waterboy.
He played -- He played waterboy great.
Everybody who was thirsty got a drink right away... yesterday at the -- at the football game.
Fool' s ball!
Bunch of overgrown monsters manhandling each other.
Remember when that man wanted you to play fool' s ball, Bobby?
Yeah, l -- He -- Roy Orbison --
Coach Klein.
l- l- I remember.
So, Bobby, did they ever catch that gorilla... what escaped from the zoo and punched you in the eye?
No, Mama, he -- The- The search continues.
What would you think if Bobby did play football, Mrs Boucher?
Well, I wouldn' t think much of it at all. and to tell you the truth, I don' t think much of you... and all your snotty questions, Miss Vallencourt.
I' m quite disturbed to see that you' re so interested in my boy.
- Mm.
- Mama.
- He has to wear two pair of socks.
Well, men are supposed to have stinky feet.
- Mama, please.
- Well, you know what?
I happen to find Deputy Dog to be... very, very sexy.
- Mama, I' m beggin 'you, don' t.
- That' s his sheet back there.
lf you' il excuse me, ladies, I' m gonna go hang myself.
- Now you see what you done?
- What I did?
The "onliest" woman in my boy' s life is me.
Nobody' s gonna take him away, especially not some godless Jezebel like you.
Oh, yeah, well your Bobby is a grown man. and guess what?
Oh, yes, he can.
Whoever he wants.
'Cept you!
- I want you to stay away from her, you hear me?
I' m sorry, Vicki Vallencourt.
Whatever.

When we report on the S. C. L. S. U. Mud Dogs here on Sportscenter, another number to their amazing losing streak, which now stands at 41. it' s usually to add...
But now, Bobby Boucher has given us another reason.
ln the Mud Dog' s latest loss this past Saturday, the amazing 31- year- old freshman set a new N. C. a. a. record... by sacking the quarterback 16 times, shattering the old record of seven. and, oh, by the way, Bobby Boucher is also the team' s waterboy, which, of course, begs the question:
What exactly are they putting in the water... down in Jackson' s Bayou, Louisiana?
* There is a house in New Orleans *
We are one family with one dream.
There are 40 of you on this team, not just one.
Bobby can' t do this by himself.
Go, go, go!
Thank you.
Bobby, you' re gonna have to do this by yourself...
We' ve got to win one game.
Can you go out there and make something happen?
- Visualize and attack.
- Yes.
First- string quarterback, Tommy Gardner, does not have a broken neck.
Blue, 52!
She' s the devil!
She' s the most beautiful woman in the world.
- I never said she was the devil.
- She' s the most beautiful woman
Oh, please, don' t hurt me!
You crazy man!
Okay, okay, okay!
It' s a safety!
I' m so sorry, Mama. please, forgive me.
I love you so much, Mama.
I love you.
- I love you too.
- [Derek]

- Yeah, baby!
Thank you.
It was my daddy' s.
Thanks.
- Come on in.
Sergeant Stutter.
- Want a beer?
- I' il take a Scotch and water.
- You just make a joke, Bobby?
- Yes, I did.
[Chuckling]
Good one.
Now that you finally won a game, right, you feel looser, the pressure is off, and that will lead to a lot more victories.
- Yeah, that and a waterboy getting 20 sacks a game.
- professor!
We still havin 'that test on amphibians and reptiles next Friday?
Yes, sir.
That is, if it' s all right with you.
- Of course, it is.
- My best regards to your dear mama.
Let' s talk to the waterboy.
You played amazing at the game today, Bobby. and you are so cute.
ls there a girl you' re seein '?
Seein '?
Uh, uh, I see a lot of girls.
I see a lot of guys too.
I think that' s sexy.
You ever been with a guy and a girl at the same time?
The other night, I was with my mama and Coach Klein at the same time.
You are a bad boy.
I wish you were my boyfriend.
Oh, thank you, but, see, there' s this girl, Vicki Vallencourt.
Mama said that.
Consequently, I am prohibited from contact with her.
But I hope to get past that one day 'cause she' s nice to talk to.
[Mumbling, lndistinct]
** [Rap]
** [Rap Continues]
Yo, we have a very special guest here today.
Let' s have a warm L. T. welcome for Bobby Boucher.
- [Cheering]
- Thank you, Mr Lawrence Taylor.
Tell me, what is your secret?
How do you find yourself
What- What happens is, the- the- the centre has- has the ball first. and- and- and the quarterback will say, "Hike."
That' s when the c- center puts the ball in- into the hands of the quarterback.
Hmm?
Gentleman, which brings me to my next point:
Don' t smoke crack.
Vicki Vallencourt.
What you doin 'here?
Oh, nothin '.
I was just thinkin '... about stealin' L. T. 's porsche over there.
But I suppose I ought to be movin 'on before I get you
Well, Mr Coach Klein said that what Mama don' t know won' t hurt her. in trouble with your mama.
So maybe we could ride home together.

You better get goin '.
My God, Bobby, I mean, sometimes, I just don' t know why I bother with you.
[announcer]
It looks like the Cinderella S. C. L. S. U. Mud Dogs,
led by linebacker Bobby Boucher, are gonna fall one victory short of that Bourbon Bowl bid.
lowa could win the game by nailing this 20- yard field goal.
Yeah, but the Mud Dogs have played a sensational football game.
Let' s take a look at the way Boucher entered the Hawkeyes' last drive.
Here we see Boucher instantly penetratin 'the pocket.
There' s a lot of pain and shame in those eyes.
Friends, it' s all over.
- [Man]
- Wow, that is a disturbing image.
Difficult to watch, Chris.
[Exhales]
Bobby!
Water sucks.
Gatorade is better.
- Use it on the field.
Gatorade not only quenches your thirst better, it tastes better, too, idiot.
You' re- You' re- You' re drinkin 'the wrong water.
- Gatorade.
- H2O.
- Gatorade!
- H2O!
* Water sucks, It really, really sucks Water sucks *
- * It really, really sucks ** - Stop saying that.
[Bobby Whimpering]
- [announcer] and my friend, Chris, the Mud Dogs are goin 'to the Bourbon Bowl.
With yesterday' s come- from- behind victory, the S. C. L. S. U. Mud Dogs... earned a New Year' s Day date with Red Beaulieu and the Louisiana Cougars... in the first annual Bourbon Bowl.
But not only has the waterboy changed S. C. L. S. U. 's fortunes, he' s got other teams looking around the sidelines for talent.
ln fact, yesterday, Michigan, devastated by injury, experimented with their towel boy at wide receiver.
- [Groaning]
- But the towel boy ran into [Cheering]
You know, when I see so many of you here tonight, it reminds me just about how special this season really was.
Not just for the team.
Not just for the students.
But for each and every one of you... in our small corner of Louisiana!
- [Cheering]
- You can do it!
Oh, yes, we can, and, yes, we will.
Because we' ve got... a young man who has been so vital to our success. a wonderful student- athlete.
and a wonderful friend.
Ladies and gentlemen, Bobby Boucher!
- [Together]
- You can do it!
Thank you so much... for bein 'my friends.
- [Crowd Cheering]
- You can do it!
I' d also like to take this opportunity... to tell you that my mama don' t know how I play football, so if- if you could not tell my mama l- I play football, [Cheering]
[Horn Honking]
We must be a little lost.
We' re tryin 'to get to the Bourbon Bowl.
Looks like we ended up in Retardville, U. S. a.
Hey, Waterboy, you fixin 'to tackle all of us?
- Kick his water- lovin 'ass, Greg.
- I asked you a question, dumb ass.
You even exhale, and I will saw your head off.
You can do it!
Cut his fucking head off!
Just a minute.
Now what is the problem here, honey?
I mean, whatever it is, we don' t want this to get physical.
[Vicki]
Yeah, well, your team actin 'like a bunch of shitheads.
[Chuckling]
are supposed to act.
However, assault with a deadly weapon, very, very serious offence.
Officer, get her little country ass outta here.
- [Crowd Murmuring]
- Thank you, Vicki.
Let' s go. ah!
It' s the waterboy!
I got something for you.
This is his transcript from South Lafayette High School... in Cherokee plains, Louisiana.
Now, the problem with that... is there ain' t no South Lafayette High School in Cherokee plains, Louisiana.
- So obviously, this is a fake!
However, this is not a fake.
This is from the N. C. a. a.
They don' t think you ought to play football no more.
So allow me to say this to you one more time:
You' re fired.
We suck again!
Ever see a championship ring?
- Don' t be messin 'with the champ.
I was home schooled.
l- I didn' t know I needed -- - You didn' t go to high school?
- Forged a fake transcript.
- No, no, l- l- I didn' t.
- The waterboy' s a cheater.
Cut his head off.
Listen, everybody!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
Mud Dogs!
- That' s the way!
- The N. C. a. a. is gonna allow you to play in the Bourbon Bowl.
- Yes.
Everybody hates me.
That' s not true.
Nobody else thought that to be too bad of an idea.
I did it.
I did it!
I did it!
- It was me.
- Why?
Because I wanted you to play.
'Cause it was the only way to get you in.
I am so sorry.
Why didn' t you s- stick up for me down by the river?
The truth is, I fled.
I cried like a ten- year- old girl!
[Groaning]
Red and I have a history.
Twenty years ago, we were assistants to Coach Cavanaugh... at the University of Louisiana.
Red ran the practices, and I used to come up with the plays.
Oh, boy, was I good.
I would write these foolproof plays in my little green notebook that I had.
- The opposition didn' t even know what hit 'em. and when Coach Cavanaugh was going to retire, - [Door Knocking]
** [Disco]
- Hey, Red.
- How ya doin '?
Come by to wish me luck?
Sure.
What' s up?
Well, you know that green notebook you use to write
Well, I need to show Cavanaugh that I can come up with some good play ideas. all them football plays in?
But you didn' t come up with them.
They' re my plays.
I need them.
Klein, I' m gonna have this book one way or another, so you might as well let the damn thing go, 'cause if you don' t, it' s gonna get awfully, awfully physical around here. and I don' t think you want that, do you?
[Cackling]
Of course, Red got the job.
Next day, fired me.
Once he had my notebook, he didn' t need me any more.
I didn' t take it very well.
No, Grandma, I didn' t get it.
I can' t believe it myself.
I know.
I' m so numb.
I just hate him, I hate him, I hate him.
That is a terrible story, Coach.
- But why- why don' t you just come up with some new plays?
- I can' t.
- I tried.
I guess I have a mental block, you know, ever since Red took
I knew what he was gonna do! and I just didn' t fight back.
Well, you' re gonna show him that you' re a man on Saturday.
and I' m gonna show everybody that I' m not a dummy.
** [Fiddle]
Mama, maybe you could stop brushin 'my hair so I can read.
Read?
You don' t have to read.
- What you readin 'for?
- 'Cause I enjoys it, Mama.
Don' t look like to me you enjoys it, sittin 'there all grouchy.

Fool' s ball?
You playin 'the fool' s ball behind my back?
The only reason I' m doin 'this so, so I can go to school.
School?
You goin 'to school?
I wanted to tell you.
You off gallivantin 'with your fancy fool' s ball friends at school, while I' m sittin' here all day with nobody to keep me company,
The chickens are comin 'home to roost, Bobby Boucher. except Steve?
You reap the fruit of your selfish ways.
You' re gonna lose all your fancy fool' s ball games... and you' re gonna fail your big exam, because school is --
- The devil?
- [Gasps]
Everything is the devil to you, Mama!
Well, I like school, and I like football! and I' m gonna keep doin 'them both because they make me feel good!
and by the way, Mama, alligators are ornery... because of their medulla oblongata!
and I like Vicki, and she likes me back! and she showed me her boobies, and I liked them too!

That' s nonsense!
I invented electricity.

l- l- I can' t believe that l- l- I told Mama... that I got feelings for you.
Well, welcome to your manhood, Bobby Boucher.
Yes, once again, I' m not quite sure what that means, but --
- You know, we should get goin '.
I told the coach that I' d drive to the game with him.
I was with you from two to four last night.
Bobby, your mama got sick this mornin '.
She' s in the hospital.
Mama, what have I done?
I' m so sorry, Mama.
Doctors say... they can' t figure out what' s wrong with her.
But I know what' s wrong.
Bobby, that' s ridiculous.
Everybody else in this town turn on me at the drop of a hat.
Mama is the only one who really cares if I live or die.
She my whole world.
Will you just leave us alone?
She' il be fine, Bobby.
We better get going.

Bobby Boucher, all these folks are here tonight... to tell you that they' re sorry -- that they' re sorry for not supportin 'you... when it meant the most.
But you do have friends, and one of 'em wants to say somethin'.
Come on.
I am not what you would call a handsome man.
The good Lord chose not to bless me with -- with charm, athletic ability or a fully functional brain.
You see, you' re an inspiration... to all of us who, who weren' t born handsome... and charming and cool and -- [Sobbing]
- It' s okay.
But she can' t hear you, 'cause she' s unconscious.
I' m sorry to disappoint you all, but please keep your voices down... so my mama can get her rest.
[all Groaning]
We gotta win tomorrow!
Mama!
Thank God, you' re okay.
I was so bad, Mama.
- I' ve been a real knucklehead.
- Oh, hush, baby.
You should' ve seen this a long time ago.
Oh, my word!
- ls that my daddy?
- No, no.
That' s a guy I dated before I met your father.
Oh, you could iron a shirt on his stomach.
Well, that was lust, not love.
Turn the page.
There' s your daddy.
- So handsome.
Read on.
"Dear Helen."
Who' s Helen?
That' s my first name, Bobby.
"I have arrived here in New Orleans.
"It is even more beautiful than in the picture books.
"I' m sure I' il have no problem finding work,
"so you can expect my next letter to contain lots of money.
Your loving husband, Robert. "
That' s nice, Mama.
That' s you.
"but sorry, no money yet.
"New Orleans is an expensive city.
"Expensive, but fun.
Hope all is well.
Robert. "
"To Whom It May Concern:
"This will be my last letter.
"We have grown apart over these last six weeks.
"I now have two loves in my life:" big- city livin 'and a voodoo woman named phyilis.
Ciao, Roberto. "
He changed his name to Roberto.
I guess he thought it was more exotic.
But Mama says that -- I mean, you say that --
You- You --
You shouldn' t be dredgin 'up these painful memories in your condition.
Oh, hush.
Your mama' s as healthy as an ox, and as dumb as one to boot.
I was so scared you' d abandon me too. and I made you abandon all those people who depend on ya.
I hid you away from the world, Bobby Boucher.
But I can' t hog you to myself no more, because everyone' s seen how wonderful you are.
- Now.
You go play fool' s ball with your friends.
Welcome to aBC' s coverage of the Bourbon Bowl.
Good afternoon, everybody.
I' m Brent Musburger, and the big story here, Dan, is a game that' s lost some of its lustre... along with my colleague, Dan Fouts. without its star player, the waterboy Bobby Boucher.
You know, Red' s got a couple of solid early rounders out there.
I know, but I really wanted to scout that waterboy.
Reminds me of Greg Lloyd.
"Zack" Thomas.
- Whatever.
- ls she ready?
Oh, yeah.
She' s more than ready.
Come on, Bobby!
You' il miss the boat!
Let' s go, ladies.
[Whistle Blowing]
We are underway!
Holdsworth is gonna bring it out from nine yards deep.
- [Grunting]
- Yeah!
- [Cheering]
- Touchdown, Cougars!
- Time running down in the first quarter.
Cougars lead is 17- 0.
Three!
Thirty- three!
- [Growling]
Thirty- three!
Mama, you think we' il make it on time?
Hang on!
[Musburger]
The Cougars are dominating.
Let' s hope the Mud Dogs can make some adjustments.
- Well, they better, 'cause they suck.
anybody got an idea?
- Remember the time Bobby tackled the referee by mistake?
Yeah, that was pretty funny.
How about the time he tackled the guy from Louisville...
- [all Laughing]
Y' all remember when he intercepted the ball and his pants fell off? and then he ran for the touchdown, bare- assed.
Remember the time Bobby -- [Mumbling lncoherently]
You' re the heart and soul of this team, Bobby. and the only one of us who could' ve passed that test.
Yeah!
- Two, three!
Woof!
Bobby Boucher just arrived at halftime. and on a fan boat, Brent.
Waterboy!
Waterboy!
Waterboy!
Waterboy!
Fool' s ball' s not for the devil.
It' s for my Bobby.
Time to open up some whoop- ass.
Shit, he showed up. all right, look.
Go in there and do exactly like we planned.
This could be the start of some high drama, folks.
Or are the Mud Dogs too far behind?
Bobby Boucher is on defence.
The pitch.
It' s a reverse!
Hut!
Boucher' s not fooled.
Robideaux' s got it!
Touchdown, Mud Dogs!
- Boy, Boucher knocked the poop out of him.
[all Shouting]
Slap hands!
Have faith in my Bobby.
The Mud Dogs are faced with yet another third and long.
- Grenouille back to pass.
He' s gonna be stuffed again! and the Mud Dogs offence is
But the way their defence is fired up, they still have still unable to move that ball.
Look.
Now, what if we, uh -- [Whispering]
Trust me.
- [Whistle Blows]
- Y' all gonna play or what?
How do you all like my new offence?
all right, it' s second and 12...
[Whistle Blows]
What is Red Beaulieu doing, refusing to play offence?
- [Dan]
No, it' s not, Brent.
It' s brilliant, because Red is taking the waterboy out of the game.
[Musburger]
Well, the Mud Dog' s most valuable player, the linebacker they call "the Waterboy," is now powerless.
That means Coach Klein will have to find another way to outfox Red.
Mud Dogs call a time- out.
Mr Coach Klein!
Mr Coach Klein!
- Where are you going?
- I was just gonna get a hot pretzel.
Mr Coach Klein, are you afraid of Red Beaulieu?
I am petrified of him.
- Yes.
Visualize somebody you' re not afraid of. - and then attack, like you told me.
- I' il try.
Yeah.
[Baby Talking]
He' s gonna come here -- [Chattering, Shouting]
Come and get this one, Cougars.
Snap to Grenouille. a reverse!
No, it' s a double reverse!
Oh, what a block! and Boudier springs free!
Trouble!
Lateral!
What a play!
Grenouille to the 15!
To the 5!
- Touchdown, Mud Dogs!
I guess Coach Klein does have a few tricks up his sleeve after all.
What the hell -- What the hell is this?
We go from a championship football team to a bunch of dogs!
Right now, we' re going to go down to the sidelines and our man, Lynn Swann.
I' m with Vicki Vallencourt, who' s taking over...
I' m just tryin 'not to screw up too bad.
What' s your prediction for
Mud Dogs are gonna win, 30 to 27. the rest of this ball game?
How' d you come up with that guess?
Guess?
- Oh!
Be careful down there, Swannie.
Where' s Meaney?
- Meaney?
- Get in there and let' s see if that waterboy can stop you.
- Yes, sir!
What do you make of this, Dan?
Well, Brent, he' s gotta find some way to neutralize the waterboy.
He probably thinks that Meaney will just pound it in there like
Hey, Waterboy! ls your girlfriend gonna save you again?
Fridge used to do for the Bears.
Oh, no, sir.
I' m gonna take matters into my own hands.
Whoo!
power bomb, compliments of Captain lnsano.
Visualize the attack.
Go kick the ball.
How you doin ', boy?
No, no, no!
Coach Klein opts for the field goal.
Then they have to hope for the onside
Dan, look what we have here.
Last game of the year, Brent.
Set!
The snap.
It' s a fake!
Boucher' s out in front! a great block!
- [Grunting]
- and a second one!
Touchdown, Mud Dogs!
- Boucher led him all the way!
Red Beaulieu is steaming, Dan.
The Cougar' s lead is down to three.
[Cheerleaders Cheering, lndistinct]
The Mud Dogs need the ball back if they' re gonna have a shot at overtime. and Bobby Boucher is now on the kickoff team.
- Last game of the year, Brent.
- [Horns Blaring]
Who' s it gonna be?
Who' s it gonna be?
[Musburger]
- Mud Dogs football!
I got it --
That was a cheap shot.
- [Murmuring]
That puts the Mud Dogs in field goal range for the tie.
- Dan, I' m not sure that Boucher is able to get back up.
It' s still cold.
- Oh, my baby!
Now, that' s high quality H2O.
You go on, now!
The waterboy just needed some water.
Make it happen, Bobby!
- Wow, Dan.
- are you okay?
He tried to open up a can of whoop- ass on me.
Listen, I have an idea for the last play.
The offence is gonna line up like this.
- You' re gonna be right here.
There' il be no tie here today.
Coach Klein is sending his offence back on to the field.
He' s going for the win right now.
[Fouts]
He' il either be a hero or a goat because of this.
[Musburger] and Dan, Bobby Boucher is back on the field.
He is now playing offence!
We know.
Meaney, if they give that Waterboy the football,
Do not let him get away.
- Yes, sir.
- I' m ready, friend.
Set!
Touchdown!
The Mud Dogs win it!
Bobby Boucher' s the hero!
He' s gone from waterboy, Dan, to saviour! and it' s because he didn' t hold anything back!
Well, Swannie' s down on the field with our hero, so let' s go to Lynn now!
We did it!
I can' t believe it!
- Whoo!
I love you, too, baby.
[Screaming]
You got your manhood!
Bobby, congratulations.
You' re the M. V. p. of the Bourbon Bowl.
How do you feel?
- [Cheering]
- There you go, Bobby!
- Lookin 'sharp, Bobby!
You the man, Bobby!
- But you got yourself a fine woman.
- Oh, thank you, Mama.
Good luck, son.
This is the best day of my life!
You just wait till tonight.
- What' s gonna happen tonight?
- [Chuckles]
You can do it!
You can do it all night long!
I' m gonna go do it!
- Bobby, it' s me!
- Your daddy, Roberto.
I' ve seen you on the ESpN when they was talkin 'about
I' m gonna stay in school and graduate. you being drafted by the NFL.
The hell with school, dopey!
Take the money!
[Crowd Cheering]
- Nice hit, Mama.
* Thank the Lord for love like ours *
* as tomorrow *
[Shouting, Whistling]
So stay with us because later this afternoon, we' re lucky enough to be talking to Anna Scott,
Hollywood' s biggest star by far.
Miss Scott' s latest film is once again topping the charts. -% [Piano]
- [Man Continues, indistinct]% She may be the face I can' t forget%% A trace of pleasure or regret%% May be my treasure or the price%% I have to pay%% She may be the mirror%% Of my dream%% A smile reflected in a stream%% She may not be what she may seem%% inside her shell%% She who always seems so happy in a crowd%% Whose eyes can be so private and so proud%% No one' s allowed to see them when they cry%% She may be the love that cannot hope to last%% May come to me from shadows of the past%% That I' il remember till the day%% I die%% She may be the reason I survive%% The why and wherefore I' m alive%% The one I' il care for through the rough%% And ready years%% Me, I' il take her laughter and her tears%% And make them all my souvenirs%% For where she goes I' ve got to be%% The meaning of my life is%% She%% She%% Oh, she% [Man Narrating]
Of course I' ve seen her films... and always thought she was, well, fabulous.
But, you know, a million, million miles from the world I live in... which is here, Notting Hill, my favorite bit of London.
Rock hard bananas, five for a pound!
The tattoo parlor with a guy outside who got drunk... and now can' t remember why he chose "I love Ken".
The radical hairdressers where everyone comes out looking like the Cookie Monster, whether they want to or not.
And then, suddenly, it' s the weekend, and from break of day hundreds of stalls appear out of nowhere, filling Portobello Road, right up to Notting Hill Gate.
And wherever you look thousands of people are buying millions of antiques, some genuine and some... not quite so genuine.
And what' s great is that lots of friends have ended up in this part of London.
That' s Tony, for example, architect turned chef, who recently invested all the money he ever earned in a new restaurant.
And so, this is where I spend my days and years... in this small village in the middle of the city in a house with a blue door... that my wife and I bought together before she left me for a man... who looked exactly like Harrison Ford.
And where I lead a strange half- life with a lodger called --
Spike!
You couldn' t help me with an incredible important decision, could you?
Is this important in comparison to, let' s say, whether they should cancel Third World debt?
I am at last going out on a date with the great Janine, and I just wanna be sure I' ve picked the right T- shirt.
- What are the choices?
- Well, wait for it.
First there' s this one.
[Growls]
Yeah, it might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
Point taken.
If it' s romance we' re looking for, I believe I have just the thing.
Yeah, well, there again, she might not think you had true love on your mind.
Just one more.
True love here I come.
Yeah, that' s -- that' s, um, perfect.
Great.
Thanks.
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
[Narrating]
And so it was just another hopeless Wednesday, as I walked the thousand yards through the market to work, never suspecting that this was the day that was gonna change my life forever.
This is work, by the way, my little travel bookshop,
- Morning, Martin.
- Morning, Monsignor. which, um, well, sells travel books, and to be frank with you, doesn' t always sell many of those.
Classic.
Profit from major sales push, minus 347 pounds.
Shall I, uh, go and get you a cappuccino?
- You know, ease the pain a bit.
Better make it a half.
Get your logic.
Demi- cappu coming right up.
Um, can I help you at all?
No, thanks.
I' il just... look around.
Fine.
Uh, that book' s really not great.
Just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.
You' d be wasting your money.
But if it' s Turkey you' re interested in, um, this one, on the other hand, is very good.
Um, I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps.
Um, there' s also a very amusing incident with a kebab, um, which is one of many amusing incidents.
Thanks.
I' il think about it.
Or, in the bigger hardback variety, there' s --
Can you just give me a second?
Excuse me.
What?
We' ve got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
So?
So I saw you put that book down your trousers.
- What book?
- The one down your trousers.
I don' t have a book down my trousers.
Right.
I tell you what.
I really apologize.
I did have a book down my trousers?
Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you' d remove the Cadogan Guide to Bali from your trousers... and either wipe it and put it back or buy it.
I' il see you in a sec.
I' m sorry about that.
No, it' s fine.
I was gonna steal one, but now I' ve changed my mind.
Oh, signed by the author, I see.
Um, yeah, couldn' t stop him.
- [Chuckles]
- Can I have your autograph?
- What' s your name?
- Rufus.
What does it say?
And above it, it says, "Dear Rufus, you belong in jail."
Good one.
- Do you want my phone number?
- Tempting.
But... no.
Thank you.
I will take this one.
Well, on second thoughts, um, maybe it' s not that bad after all.
Actually, it' s a sort of a classic, really.
And, um, I tell you what.
I' il throw in one of those for free.
Useful for, uh, lighting fires, wrapping fish, that sort of thing.
- Thanks.
- Pleasure.
Cappuccino, as ordered.
Thanks.
Who?
Was it someone famous?
- No, no, no.
Would be exciting, though, wouldn' t it, if someone famous came into the shop?
Do you know -- and this is pretty amazing, actually -- but I once saw Ringo Starr.
- Where was that?
- Kensington High Street.
It might have been that man from Fiddler on the Roof.
- You know, Toppy.
- Topol.
Yes, that' s right.
Topol.
Actually, Ringo Starr doesn' t -- doesn' t look at all like, uh, Topol.
Yeah, but he was -- he was quite a long way away from me.
So actually it could' ve been neither of them.
Yes, I suppose so, yes.
- It' s not a classic anecdote, is it?
- Not a classic, no.
- Another one?
- [Sighs]
No.
I' il have an orange juice.
- Oh!
Shit!
I' m so sorry.
- Here.
Let me -- - Get your hands off!
I - I live just over the street.
You can get cleaned up.
I just need to get my car back.
I also have a phone.
I' m confident that in five minutes... we could have you spick- and- span and back on the street again.
In the non- prostitute sense, obviously.
Well -- What do you mean, "just over the street"?
- Give it to me in yards.
- Uh, 18 yards.
That' s my house there with the blue front door.
Come on in.
I' il just -- I' il just --
Um, right.
Come in.
It' s, um, not quite as tidy as it normally is, I fear.
But, um -- The bathroom' s on the top floor.
And the telephone' s just -- just up here.
Let -- Let me, um --
Straight on -- straight on up.
Bugger.
- No.
- Coffee?
- No.
- Orange juice?
Probably not.
Um, something else cold.
- [Bottles Rattling]
Water?
- No.
- Would you like something to eat?
Uh, something to nibble?
Um, apricots soaked in honey?
Quite why, no one knows, because it stops them tasting of apricots... and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you' d just buy honey instead of... apricots.
They' re yours if you want them.
No.
Do you always say "no" to everything?
No.
I' d better be going.
Thanks for your, uh, help.
You' re welcome.
And, uh, may I also say, um, heavenly.
I' il just take my one chance to say it.
After you' ve read that terrible book, you' re certainly not going to be coming back to the shop.
Thank you.
Well, my pleasure.
So... it was nice to meet you.
Surreal but, um -- but nice.
Sorry.
"Surreal but nice"?
What was I thinking?
- Hi.
- I forgot my other bag.
I' m very sorry about the "surreal but nice" comment.
- Disaster.
- [Chuckles]
Oh, my God.
My flatmate.
There' s no excuse for him.
[Clears Throat]
I' m just going into the kitchen to get some food.
Then I' m gonna tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins.
Right.
I mean, I' il tell myself sometimes.
I won' t believe it.
- Bye.
There' s something wrong with this yogurt.
It' s not yogurt.
It' s mayonnaise.
Oh, right.
On for a videofest tonight?
I got some absolute classics.
- Smile.
- No.
- Smile.
- I' ve got nothing to smile about.
I' m going to ask you to marry me.
Somewhere in the world there' s a man who' s allowed to kiss her.
Yes, she is, uh, fairly fabulous.
- Do you have any books by Dickens?
We only sell travel books.
Oh, right.
How about the new John Grisham thriller?
Well, no, 'cause that' s, uh -- that' s a novel too, isn' t it?
Oh, right.
Have you got Winnie the Pooh?
Martin, your customer.
- Uh, can I help you?
- Hey.
-% Once in a lifetime% - Just, um, incidentally, uh, why... are you wearing that?
Combination of factors really.
Uh, no clean clothes.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Vicious circle.
And I was, like, rooting around in your things... and I found this, and I thought "cool".
Kinda... spacey.
There' s something wrong with the goggles, though.
No, they were, um, prescription.
- Groovy.
- So I could see all the fishes properly.
You should do more of this stuff.
- So, look, any messages today?
- Yeah, I wrote a couple down.
Right?
You want me to write down all your messages?
Okay, who are the ones that you didn' t write down from?
No.
There was one from your mum.
- No one else?
- Absolutely no one else.
Though if we' re going for this obsessive writing down all the message thing, some American girl called Anna called a few days ago.
- What did she say?
- Well, it was genuinely bizarre.
It' s Anna. "
Then she said, "Call me at The Ritz"... and then gave herself a completely different name.
- Which was?
No, I -- I know that.
Um, I know she' s using another name.
Um, I don' t know.
Imagine, if you will, the stupidest person you' ve ever met.
- Yes, sir, I have him in my mind.
And now double it.
And that is the, um -- what can I say -- the git that I am living with.
And he can' t remember --
- Try Flintstone.
- I' m sorry, what?
I think she said her name was Flintstone.
I don' t -- I don' t suppose, um, Flintstone rings any bells, does it?
- Oh, I' il put you right through, sir.
- Oh, my God.
Hello.
- Hi there.
- Hello?
Hi.
It' s William...
Thacker.
Uh- huh.
Oh, no, I promise you I' ve never played anything cool in my entire life.
My flatmate, who' il I' il stab to death later, never gave me the message.
I could drop round for tea later or something.
- Things are pretty busy here.
I might be free around 4: 00.
Right.
- Yea -- Bye.
Classic.
Classic.
- Which floor?
- Three, please.
Uh, are you sure this is --
Oh, yeah.
Sure.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Here' s the, uh, thing.
Do you wanna come this way?
Through here.
So what did you think of the film?
Yeah, I thought it was fantastic.
Close Encounters meets Jean de Florette.
I agree.
I didn' t get down what magazines you' re from.
- Time Out.
- Great.
And you' re from?
Uh, Horse & Hound.
The name' s William Thacker.
I think, actually, she might be expecting me.
Take a seat and I' il go check.
I see you' ve, uh -- I see you' ve brought her some flowers.
[Laughing]
These are for my, um, grandmother.
She' s in a hospital just down the road.
Thought I' d kill two birds with one stone, you know.
Sure, right.
Absolutely.
Which hospital' s that?
Do you mind me not saying?
- Name of the hospital kind of gives it away.
Sure.
Cheers.
Ooh, yes.
Right, uh, Mr. Thacker.
Will you come this way.
You' ve got five minutes.
- Hello.
Uh, I brought these, but clearly --
They' re great.
Ah, listen, I' m sorry about not ringing back.
The whole "two- names concept"... was totally too much for my flatmate' s pea- sized intellect.
No, it' s a stupid privacy thing.
I always pick a... cartoon character.
Last time I was Mrs. Bambi.
- Everything all right?
- Yes, thank you.
- Yeah.
- Good.
Well.
So, uh --
Uh, I' il just... fire away then, shall I?
Right.
The film' s great, and, um,
I just was wondering whether... you ever thought of having, um, more, uh, horses in it.
Uh, well, we would have liked to, but it was, um, difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Space, right, yeah.
Yeah, obviously very difficult.
I' m so sorry.
They thrust this thing into my hand --
I thought this would all be over by now.
I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.
I seriously don' t know what came over me.
And I just wanted to make sure that you were fine about it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Absolutely fine.
Do remember that Miss Scott is also keen to talk about her next project... which is, um, shooting later in the summer.
Excellent.
Any horses in that one?
Or hounds for that matter.
Our readers are equally intrigued by both species.
Oh.
Well, bad luck.
But, um, if there were horses in it, would you be riding them... or would you be getting, a -- a stunt- horse- double- man- thing?
I -- I' m a complete moron.
I --
This is very weird.
It' s the sort of thing that happens in dreams, not in real life.
I mean, good dreams.
It' s a -- it' s a dream, in fact, uh, to see you again.
What happens next in the dream?
I suppose in the, uh, dream -- dream scenario -- I just, uh, change my personality... because you can do that in dreams and, um, walk over and, uh, kiss the girl.
Time' s up, I' m afraid.
- Um, nearly, nearly.
- Well, maybe just one last question.
- Right, right.
Are you... busy tonight?
- Yes.
Right.
- Come in.
- Well, it was nice to meet you.
Yes, and you.
Surreal... but nice.
Thank you.
You are Horse & Hounds' favorite actress.
You and Black Beauty... tied.
How was she?
Oh, um, fabulous.
She took your grandmother' s flowers.
That' s right.
- [Karen]
Oh, Mr. Thacker.
Mr. Thacker, if you' d like to come with me, we can rush you through the others.
The others?
Mr. Thacker is from Horse & Hound.
- How' s it going?
- Very well, thank you.
- [Clock Ticking]
Yes, enormously.
- Right.
- Yes, I did.
- Good.
Any bit in particular?
You tell me what bit you enjoyed the most, and I' il tell you if I enjoyed making that bit.
Uh, I...
liked the bit in space... very much.
Did you identify with the character you' re playing?
- No.
[Spanish]
Because he' s playing a psychopathic flesh- eating robot.
Classic.
So, uh, is this your first film?
It' s my 22nd.
- Da Vinci?
- DiCaprio.
[Chuckles]
And is -- is he your favorite Italian director?
- Mr. Thacker.
- Oh, no.
- No.
Um -- Yeah, so the, um -- the -- the thing I was doing tonight, I' m not doing anymore.
I told them I had to spend the evening... with Britain' s premier equestrian journalist.
Well, great.
That' s, uh --
Shittity brickitty.
Shit.
We' re meant to be having dinner.
- No.
I' m sure I can get out of it.
No, I mean, if it' s fine with you, I' il be your date.
You -- You' il be my date... to my little sister' s birthday party?
- If it' s all right.
- Well, yeah, I' m sure it' s all right.
My friend Max is cooking, and he is generally acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world.
But, um, you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
- He' s bringing a girl?
- Miracles do happen.
- Does the girl have a name?
Wouldn' t say.
Oh, Christ!
What is going on in there?
- Oh, God!
Come on in.
Vague food crisis.
Hiya!
The guinea- fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
- Don' t even ask.
- Hi.
Good Lord, you' re the spitting image of --
Bella, this is Anna.
- Okay, crisis over.
Max, this is Anna.
- Hello, Anna --
Scott.
Have some wine.
Thank you.
- I' il get it.
- Oh.
- Oh, yes, happy birthday.
- Thank you.
Look, your brother' s brought this girl.
Hi, guys.
Oh, holy fuck!
Hon, this is Anna.
Oh.
This is one of those key moments in life... when it' s possible you can be really genuinely cool... and I -- I' m going to fail just a hundred percent.
I -- I absolutely, totally and utterly adore you.
And I just think... you are the most beautiful woman in the world.
And, more importantly, I genuinely believe, and I' ve believed for some time now, that we could be best friends.
So what do you think?
Uh, lucky me.
Well, happy birthday.
Oh, you gave me a present.
We' re best friends already then.
Then we can be sisters.
- [Chuckles]
- That' il be Bernie.
Sorry I' m late.
Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.
- Millions down the drain.
- Hello, Anna.
- And you.
- Honey bunny,% Happy birthday to you%
- Hi, Bella.
Um, it -- it -- it' s a hat.
You don' t have to wear it or anything.
- Hi, Will.
- What?
- Wine, Bernie?
- You haven' t slept with her, have you?
That is a cheap question, and the answer is, of course, no comment.
- No comment means "yes".
- Do you ever masturbate?
- [Honey]
So, uh, tell me, um, Anna, what do you do?
- I' m an actress.
- Oh, splendid.
What do you do?
I' m actually in the stock market myself, so, uh, not really similar fields.
Though, um -- um, I have done the odd bit of amateur stuff.
Um -- uh, P. G. Wodehouse.
Farce, all that, you know.
"Careful there, Vicar."
Always imagined it' s a pretty tough job, though, acting.
- The wages are a scandal, aren' t they?
I see friends from university -- clever chaps.
Been in the business longer than you.
They' re scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year.
You know, it' s no life.
- What sort of acting do you do?
- Films, mainly.
Oh, splendid.
How' s the pay in movies?
I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Fifteen million dollars.
Right.
So that' s, well, fairly good.
Right, I think we' re ready.
Bella, can you tell me where I can find --
It' s down the corridor on the right.
I' il show you.
Quickly, quickly.
What are you doing here with Anna Scott?
- Anna Scott?
Shut up!
- What, the film star?
- Oh, God!
- Oh, God.
- What did you say to her?
I actually walked into the loo with her.
I was still chatting when she started unbuttoning her jeans.
- She had to ask me to leave.
- So you knew who she was?
Of course I did, but he didn' t.
Well, not instantly, but I -- I -- I got away with it.
- What do you think of the guinea- fowl?
- I' m a vegetarian.
Oh, God.
So, how' s the guinea- fowl?
Best guinea- fowl I' ve ever tasted.% It' s amazing how you%
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I' ve long suspected -- that we really are the most desperate lot of underachievers.
- I' m not saying it' s a bad thing.
In fact, I think it' s something we should take pride in.
I' m gonna give the last brownie as a prize... to the saddest act here.
- Uh- oh.
Well, obviously, it' s me, isn' t it?
I mean, I work in the city in a job I don' t understand, and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.
I haven' t had a girlfriend since -- well, since puberty.
And... nobody fancies me.
And if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
- Nonsense.
I fancy you.
Yeah.
You see.
And unless I' m much mistaken, your job still pays you rather a lot of money... whilst Honey here earns 20 pence a week... flogging her guts out in London' s worst record store.
I' ve got feathers.
And I' m attracted to cruel men.
- [Max]
You see, it' s incredibly sad.
- But on the other hand, her best friend is Anna Scott.
She needs me.
And most of her limbs work, whereas I' m stuck in this thing day and night, in a house full of ramps.
And to add insult to serious injury,
I' ve totally given up smoking, my favorite thing.
And, um, well, the truth is, we can' t have a baby.
Oh, Belle.
C' est la vie.
But surely that' s worth a brownie.
Well, I don' t know.
Look at William.
- Very unsuccessful professionally.
Divorced.
Used to be handsome, now kind of squidgy round the edges.
And absolutely certain never to hear from Anna again...
You did.
I can' t believe it, you did.
[Max]
What about me?
I' m sorry?
[Chuckles]
Well, a shot at it at least, huh?
You' il have to prove it.
I' m gonna fight for it.
I' ve been on a diet every day since I was 19, which basically means I' ve been hungry for a decade.
I' ve had a series of not- nice boyfriends, one of whom hit me.
Uh, and every time I get my heart broken, the newspapers splash it about as though it' s entertainment.
And... it' s taken two rather painful, um, operations... to get me looking like this.
- Really.
And one day not long from now, my looks will go, they will discover I can' t act, and I will become some sad, middle- aged woman... who... looks a bit like someone who was famous for a while.
- [All Laughing]
Pathetic effort to hog the brownie.
- Thank you for such a terrific time.
- I' m delighted.
- That' s a great tie.
- Now you' re lying.
I told you I was bad at acting. - it was lovely to meet you.
- Yeah, and you.
- No!
- Good night.
- I' m so sorry about the loo thing.
I meant to leave.
Ring me if you want someone to go shopping with.
I know lots of nice, cheap places, not that money is necessarily -- it was just so nice to meet you.
- Happy birthday.
You' re my style guru.
Can I just -- - Oh.
- Leave her.
[William]
- Thank you, everybody.
- Bye, guys.
[William]
Sorry.
They always do that when I leave the house.
It' s a stupid thing.
I hate it.
- "Floppy", huh?
- It' s to do with the hair.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
Uh, because she had an accident about 18 months ago.
And the pregnancy thing, is that to do with the accident?
You know, I' m not sure.
I don' t think they tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
Do you want to, um --
My place is just, um --
Too complicated.
That' s fine.
Busy tomorrow?
- I was.
All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them.
- They' re like little villages.
Ah, no, that' s the point.
Only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
You abide by rules like that?
I don' t.
But others do.
[Shakes Railing]
- [Laughing]
What did you say?
- Nothing.
- No, I didn' t.
- You said, "Whoopsidaisies".
No one says, "Whoopsidaisies", do they?
Because no one has said "Whoopsidaisies" for 50 years.
And even then it was -- it was just little girls with blonde ringlets.
Exactly.
So here we go again.
- [Laughing]
It' s a clinical thing.
And I' m told it won' t last long.
- Okay, stand aside.
- I don' t think that' s a good idea.
Really, it' s quite, um, tricky.
Anna.
Anna, don' t.
It' s harder than it -- No, it' s not.
It' s easy.
Come on, Flopsy.
Right.
Oh, God, this could be very unpleasant.
Bugger, bugger.
Now what in the world in this garden could make that ordeal worthwhile?
Nice garden.% Without saying a word%% You can light up the dark%
"For June who loved this garden.
From Joseph who always sat beside her. "
Some people do spend their whole lives together.
-% Try as they may they can never define% - Come and sit with me.% What' s been said between your heart and mine%% The smile on your face lets me know that you need me%% There' s a truth in your eyes%
- Have you seen my glasses?
- No, afraid not.
Big, big bollocks!
Everywhere I look there' s a pair of glasses.
But when I want to go to the cinema, they' ve vanished.
That' s compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer, is it?
Oh, shit.
Is that the time? -% [Continues]
- Thanks for all your help on the glasses thing.
Oh, you' re welcome.
Did you find them?
- Sort of.
- Great.
So who left who?
- Uh, she left me.
- She saw through me.
That' s not good.
You can give me Anna Scott any day.
Fell asleep as soon as the lights went down.
I don' t really care what the film' s like.
[Men Laughing]
I prefer the other one.
You know, blonde, sweet- looking.
You know, what' s- her- name.
Has an orgasm every time you take her out for a cup of coffee.
Meg Ryan.
No, she' s too wholesome.
The point about Miss Scott is... she' s got that twinkle in her eyes.
Spends most of her life in bloody rehab.
She' s so clearly up for it.
You see, most girls, they' re all like, "Stay away, chum."
But Anna, she is absolutely gagging for it.
[Men Laughing]
Do you know that in over 50% of the languages, the word for "actress" is the same as the word for "prostitute"?
And Anna is your definitive actress, someone really filthy you can just flip over and start again.
Sorry.
There' s really no point.
Um, sorry -- sorry to disturb you guys.
- But, um -- - Can I help?
I wish I hadn' t overheard your conversation, but I did.
And, um, I just think, you know, the person you' re talking about is a real person.
And I think she probably deserves a little bit more consideration... rather than having jerks like you drooling over her.
Oh, sod off, mate.
What are you, her dad?
[Snickering, Laughing]
- I' m sorry.
Time was I' d have done the same thing.
In fact -, [Laughing Continues]
Hi.
Oh, my God.
Uh, look, I' m sorr --
No, no, leave it.
I' m sure it was just friendly banter.
Enjoy your dinner.
The tuna' s really good.
I shouldn' t have done that.
- No, you were brilliant.
- I' m rash and I' m stupid.
What am I doing with you?
Uh, I don' t know, I' m afraid.
I don' t either.
Here we are.
Yes.
- Well, look -- - Do you wanna come up?
lots of reasons why I shouldn' t, so --
There are lots of reasons.
Do you wanna come up?
Give me five minutes?
- Hi.
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
- You' ve got to go.
Because my boyfriend who was in America is, in fact, now in the next room.
- Boyfriend?
- Yes.
- Uh, it' s, uh --
- Uh -- - Uh, room service.
I thought you guys always wore those, uh, penguin coats.
Usually we do.
But I was just, uh -- just changed to go home.
And, um, then I thought I' d take this final call.
If you don' t mind, I would like something too.
Could you bring me up some really, really cold water?
- Still, not sparkling.
- Absolutely.
Unless it' s illegal in the U. K. to serve beverages below room temperature.
I wouldn' t want you going to jail just to satisfy my whim, now.
- No, I' m sure it' s fine.
Hey, one more thing.
- Uh -- - Right.
Um, don' t -- don' t -- don' t do that.
I don' t think it' s his job to clear.
I' m sorry.
What' s your name, man?
Bernie.
Oh, listen, Bernie.
I really appreciate it.
- [Nervous Chuckle]
So, tell me.
Good surprise or nasty surprise?
- Good surprise.
- Oh, you' re such a liar.
- Huh?
- From him.
What are you gonna order?
Um, I haven' t decided yet.
Oh, well, don' t overdo it.
I don' t want people saying, "There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."
I should leave.
This is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.
I' m so sorry.
I don' t know... what to say.
"good- bye" is traditional.
-% And% - Come on. -% How can you mend% - Open up.
Spikey.
I' m in contact with some quite important spiritual vibrations.
Come on.
Hit me with it.
- There' s this girl -- - Aha.
See, I been gettin 'a female vibe.
Speak on, dear friend.
She' s someone who... can' t be mine, and, uh, it' s as if I' ve taken love heroin, and now I can' t ever have it again.
Mmm.
Yeah.
Tricky.
Tricky.
I knew a girl at school called Pandora.
Never got to see her box or -- [Chuckling]
That' s very helpful.
No.
No.
Did you?
[William]
My whole life ruined because I don' t read Hello magazine.
Let' s face facts.
This was always a no- win situation.
Anna' s... a goddess.
You know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
- Buggered, is it?
- Every time.
I think I have the solution to your problems.
- Mm- hmm.
She works in the Contracts Department.
The hair, I admit, is unfashionably frizzy, but she' s bright as a button and kisses like a nymphomaniac on death row.
- [Others Laughing]
Now... try.
I got completely lost.
Kensington Park Road.
Kensington bloody Park Garden.
- Tessa, this is Bella, my wife.
- That' s right.
And this is William.
- Hello, William.
- Max has told me everything about you.
You are a naughty boy.
- Wine?
- Oh, yes, please.
Let' s get sloshed.
Red.
Keziah.
- Some woodcock?
- No, thank you.
I' m a fruitarian.
What is a fruitarian, exactly?
We only eat things that have actually fallen from the tree or bush, that are, in fact, dead already.
Right.
So, um, these carrots?
- Have been murdered, yes.
Poor old carrots.
That' s --
That' s beastly.
Delicious coffee.
- [Laughing]
I thought it was... really, you know, interesting.
Interesting means inedible.
- Really inedible.
Yes, you' re right.
Well, maybe we' il meet again.
That would be, uh -- be great.
Bye.
Well?
Perfect.
Absolutely perfect.
And?
I think you' ve forgotten what an unusual situation you two have.
To find someone you actually... love, who' il love you.
The chances are always minuscule.
Apart from the American, I' ve only loved two girls, both total disasters.
- That' s not fair.
- One of them marries me, then leaves me... faster than you can say "Indiana Jones".
And the other -- who seriously ought to have known better -- casually marries my best friend.
- She still loves you, though.
- In a depressingly asexual way.
- Oh, God.
You were terribly funny, but... all that kissing my ears.
I don' t believe it.
I shall find myself 30 years from now still sitting on this sofa.
- Do you wanna stay?
All that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Here we go.
- Good night.
- Right.
Guilty.
Very, very guilty.
So it seems.
Can I come in?
Come in.
They were taken years ago.
I know it was --
But I was poor and -- it happens a lot.
I just --
But to make matters worse, it now appears as though... someone was filming me as well.
So what was a stupid photo shoot... now looks like a porn film.
The pictures have been sold and they' re just... everywhere.
I didn' t know where to go.
The hotel' s surrounded.
I know it' s been months, but --
This is the place.
Thank you.
I' m just in London... for two days, but what with your papers, it' s the worst place to be.
It makes me look like --
Don' t think about it.
We' il sort it out.
What would you like?
Bath?
- [Door Slams]
Oh, Christ alive!
Fantastic.
Magnificent.
You must be Spike.
- Hi.
- Just... checkin '.
Thank you, God.
I' m really sorry about last time.
- All right.
In fact, I had no idea if he was ever gonna fly in again.
It' s not often one has the opportunity to adios... the plates of a major Hollywood film star.
It was, um -- it was thrilling for me.
So how is he?
I don' t know.
It just got to the point... where I couldn' t remember any of the reasons why we were together.
And you and love?
Oh, well, there' s a question, um, without an interesting answer.
- Oh.
- It' s just that... anytime I' ve tried to keep... anything normal with a person that was... normal, it' s just been a disaster.
Listen, I appreciate that.
So what is that, a film you' re doing?
Um, start in L. A. on Tuesday.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Would you?
'Cause it' s all talk, talk, talk.
Hand it over.
Um, basic plot?
I' m a difficult but brilliant junior officer... who in about 20 minutes is gonna save the world from nuclear disaster.
Well done, you.
Would you like them to send in the H. K. s? "
No.
Turn over four T. R. S. s and tell them we need radar feedback... before the K. F. T. s return at 1900.
Then inform the Pentagon we' il need Black Star cover from 1000 through 1215.
And if you say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech, I' il pelt you with olives.
- Thank you.
- How many mistakes did I make?
- Eleven.
- Damn it.
And Wainwright -- - Cartwright.
Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is,
I promised little Jimmy I' d be home for his birthday, so could you get a message to him that I may be late.
And, uh, little Johnny?
- Yep.
- Then get a message to him too.
- I' il do what I can, Captain, but I can' t promise anything.
- And Cartwright goes.
- What do you think?
- Gripping.
It' s not Henry James, but it' s... gripping.
- Think I should do Henry James instead?
- You would be brilliant.
But this writer -- writers -- they' re pretty damn good too.
You never get anyone on Wings of the Dove saying,
"inform the Pentagon we need Black Star cover."
For me the book is the poorer for it.
I can' t believe you have that picture.
I do.
It feels like how love should be -- floating through a dark blue sky.
With a goat, playing a violin.
Happiness isn' t happiness without a violin- playing goat.
Yes.
Yes, always have had.
No.
What' s that?
Uh, big feet,
large... shoes.
The thing that is so irritating... is that now I' m so fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
You actually have... clauses in your contract about nudity?
Definitely.
"You may show the dent of the top of the artist' s buttocks, but neither cheek."
"artist must have full consultation."
- You have a stunt bottom?
- I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Yeah.
This is important stuff.
It' s one hell of a job, isn' t it?
What do you put on your passport?
"Profession:
[Chuckling]
- Right.
- Absolutely.
- It' s delicious.
Both.
Equally.
But you wouldn' t necessarily lick both?
[Laughing]
And fuzz- free.
There' s clean sheets.
Today' s been a good day, which in the circumstances is... unexpected.
Thank you.
Anyway, um, time for bed.
Or sofa bed.
Good night.
Good night.
Oh, my God.
Hello?
Hello.
- Spike.
- Right.
- I don' t want to interfere or anything, but she' s just split up from her boyfriend, right?
- Maybe.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Well, isn' t this, perhaps, a nice opportunity to...
slip her one.
Get a grip.
Fair enough.
- Okay.
Okay.
Might be too late, but okay.
Please, sod off.
- Okay.
No, no!
I thought you were, um, someone else.
I thought you were Spike.
I' m thrilled that you' re not.
What?
Nothing.
It does strike me as, well, surreal that I' m allowed to see you naked.
- You and every person in this country.
- I' m sorry.
What is it about men and nudity, huh?
Particularly breasts.
- Well --
But, seriously, they' re just breasts.
Every second person in the world has them.
[Chuckling]
Your mother has them.
You' ve seen a thousand of them.
What' s all the fuss about?
Actually, I can' t think what it is, really.
Let me just have a quick look.
- [Laughing]
Rita Hayworth used to say,
"They go to bed with Gilda, they wake up with me."
- Who was Gilda?
- Her most famous part.
Men went to bed with the dream, and they didn' t like it when they woke up with the reality.
Do you feel that way?
You are lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
I' il be right back.
- Oh.
- Or it' s brunch or lunch or something.
Can I stay a bit longer?
Stay forever.
Forgot the jam.
I' il get the jam, you get the door.
Jesus Christ.
What?
What is it?
- Nothing, really.
- You' re up to something.
- Anna, no, please!
My God.
And they got a picture of you dressed like that.
Yes.
Undressed like this, yeah.
- Morning, darling ones.
- It' s me.
The press are here.
No, there are hundreds of them.
I know.
Just get over here.
Damn it.
- Why not?
- Oh.
How did I look?
Not at all bad.
Well- chosen briefs, I' d say.
Chicks love gray.
Nice firm buttocks.
How are you doing?
How do you think I' m doing?
- I do.
Your furry friend thought he' d make a buck telling the papers where I was.
- Really?
The entire British press got up this morning and thought, "I know where Anna Scott is.
She' s in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill. "
Then you go out in your goddamn underwear!
- I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
Sorry.
- I' m so sorry.
I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip, and now I' ve landed in it all over again.
For God' s sake, I' ve got a boyfriend!
- You have?
- As far as they' re concerned I do.
And now, tomorrow there' il be pictures of you in every newspaper from here to Timbuktu!
I know that, but... just let' s stay calm.
You stay calm!
This is a perfect situation for you, isn' t it?
Minimum input, maximum publicity.
Everywhere you go, people will say, "Well done, you.
You slept with that actress.
We saw the pictures. "
- That' s yours.
Maybe it' il even help business.
Stop!
Stop!
I beg you!
How about a cup of tea?
- I just wanna go home.
- [Doorbell Rings]
Spike, see who that is, and put some clothes on, for God' s sake.
- [Clamoring]
- Looks like a chauffeur to me.
Spike owes you an expensive dinner or holiday, depending who' s got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
This is crazy behavior.
Can' t we just laugh about all this?
In the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn' t matter.
What he' s gonna say next is there' s people starving in the Sudan.
Well, there are, and we don' t have to go anywhere near that far.
My best friend slipped down stairs, cracked her back... and she' s in a wheelchair for the rest of her life.
All I' m asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
Of course, you' re right.
It' s just that I' ve dealt with this garbage for ten years.
You' ve had it for ten minutes.
Our perspectives are very different.
- Excuse me?
It' s just one day.
Tomorrow, today' s papers will all have been thrown out.
You really don' t get it.
This story will be filed.
Every time anyone writes anything about me, they' il dig up these photos.
Newspapers last forever.
I' il regret this forever.
Right.
Right.
I will feel the opposite, if that' s okay by you, and, uh, always be glad that you... came to stay.
But, um, you' re probably right.
You better go.
Was it you?
I may have told a few people down at the pub.
Right.
Something which will make you love me so much, you will want to hug me every day for the rest of my life.
- [Sighing]
Phone number of Anna Scott' s agent in London... and her agent in New York.
Now you can ring her.
Brilliant.
Thanks.
Hey, Marty.
Sexy cardi.
I have a little speech to make.
I won' t stand up because I can' t... be bothered.
Exactly a year ago today, this man here started the finest restaurant in London.
- Thank you very much.
Unfortunately, no one ever came to eat here.
- [Laughing]
And so we have to face the fact that from next week, we must find somewhere new to eat.
I just want to say to Tony... don' t take it personally.
The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life.
No one knows why some things work out and some things don' t.
- and some of us -- - Get fired.
- No!
Yeah, well, it seems they' re shifting the whole outfit... much more towards the emerging markets.
And, of course, well, I was total crap, so --
I thank you.
- Tony and Bernie.
Both crap...
- The terrible two. in their own special ways.
Since it' s an evening of announcements, uh, I' ve also got one.
Um, I' ve decided to get engaged.
I' ve found myself a nice, slightly odd- looking bloke... who I know is gonna make me happy for the rest of my life.
Wait a sec.
I don' t know anything about this.
- [Chuckling]
He' s an artist... with brilliant prospects.
No, I swear!
- Me?
- What do you think?
Well, yeah.
Groovy.
Are there any more announcements?
I feel I should apologize to everyone... for my behavior over the last six months.
I have, as you know, been somewhat down in the mouth.
There are dead people on better form.
But I just wish to make it clear that I' ve turned a corner, and, um, henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
I' m horribly drunk.% You heard me saying a prayer for%
- So you' ve laid the ghost? -% Wah, wah, wah, wah%
I believe I have.
Don' t give a damn about the famous girl?
No, I don' t think I do.
Which means you won' t be distracted by the fact that she' s back in London... grasping her Oscar... and currently to be found filming, most days, on Hampstead Heath.
Oh, God, no.
So not over her, in fact.
- Can I help you?
- I' m looking for Anna Scott.
No.
No, uh, she doesn' t.
- Right.
I mean, I am actually a friend.
I' m not a lunatic, but --
- No, you basically, er -- - Can' t let you through, sir.
Well, this is, uh --
I only found out you were here yesterday.
- I was going to call, but I -- - [Woman]
Uh, Anna.
Um --
Things aren' t going very well, and it' s our last day.
You' re clearly very busy.
But if -- if you could wait, there are... things to say.
Drink tea.
There' s lots of tea.
Come and have a look.
Are you a fan of Henry James?
- Yeah.
He' il give you a pair of headphones so you can hear the dialogue.
- No problem.
- Hi.
Here we go.
Have a seat.
- Thank you.
We' il never get this done today.
I have to be in New York on Thursday.
Oh, stop showing off.
God, that' s an enormous ass.
- I' m not listening.
- But seriously, it' s not fair.
So many tragic young teenagers with anorexia... and that girl has an ass she could perfectly well share around... with at least ten other women and still be big- bottomed.
I would think, looking at something nice like that, you and your... bony little excuse for an arse... would be well advised to keep quiet.
The end of the scene.
Um, I ask you when you' re telling everyone, and you say --
Um, tomorrow will be soon enough.
And then I -- Right.
Okay.
No one.
Just some guy from the past.
I -- it' s a bit of an awkward situation.
I don' t know what he' s doing here.
'Course.
Thanks.
I' ve got to, um --
Any time.
Uh, l- I do hate to disturb you whilst you' re cooking the books, but, uh, there' s a delivery for you.
But you see, this is not for the shop.
This is for you.
Tell me, if I employ a wet rag, would I have to pay it as much as I pay you?
Hi.
Hello.
You disappeared.
Yeah.
I had to leave.
- Fine, fine.
Everything much the same.
When they change the law, Spike and I will marry immediately.
- Awards, glory.
It' s -- it' s all nonsense, believe me.
I' d no idea how much nonsense it was, but... nonsense it all is.
Yesterday was our last day of filming, so...
I' m leaving.
But, um --
I brought this for you from home, so I thought I' d give it to you.
Thank you.
Oh, no, don' t open it now.
I' il be embarrassed.
I don' t know what it' s for, but thanks anyway.
Actually, I had it in my apartment, and I thought you' d --
Twice.
So it' s just been sitting in the hotel.
I figured --
The thing is --
What?
What is the thing?
Don' t even think about it.
- Go away.
- Right.
Sorry.
You were saying?
Yes.
I have to go away today, but I... wondered if I didn' t... whether you might let me see you a little, or... a lot, maybe.
See if you could like me again.
But yesterday that actor asked you who I was, and you just dismissed me out of hand.
I heard.
I had headphones.
You expect me to tell the truth about my life... to the most indiscreet man in England?
Uh, excuse me.
It' s your mother on the phone.
Will you tell her I' il ring her back?
I' ve actually tried that tack, but she said you' ve said that once before, and it' s now been about 24 hours... and the foot that was purple is now sort of blackish in color and --
Perfect timing, as ever.
Martin, hold the fort a second.
All right.
I thought Ghost was the most wonderful film.
Um, I' ve always wondered... what Patrick Swayze' s like in -- in -- in real life.
I can' t say that I know Patrick all that well.
He wasn' t that friendly during filming?
Oh.
[Nervous Chuckle]
Always been a bit of an ass.
Well, it was lovely to meet you.
I' m a huge, huge fan of yours.
And Demi' s, of course.
Sorry.
There' s always a pause when the jury goes out to consider their verdict.
Anna, look, um --
I' m a fairly levelheaded bloke, not often in and out of love.
Can I just say no to your... kind request and, uh, leave it at that?
Yes.
Of course.
I' il just be going, then.
It was nice to see you.
The thing is, with you I' m in real... danger.
It seems like a... perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours, but... my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not... recover, uh, if I was... once again cast aside, as I would absolutely expect to be.
There are just too many pictures of you, too many films.
You' d go and I' d be, uh, well, buggered, basically.
That really is a real no, isn' t it?
You live in...
Beverly Hills.
Everyone in the world knows who you are.
My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Fine.
Good decision.
Good decision.
The fame thing isn' t really real, you know?
I' m also just a girl... standing in front of a boy... asking him to love her.
Good- bye.
[Honey]
Yeah, good move.
I mean, when all' s said and done, she' s nothing special.
I saw her taking her trousers down, and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
Good decision, yeah.
All actresses are as mad as snakes.
- Tones, what do you reckon?
- Brilliant.
Max?
Never trust a vegetarian.
Thanks.
Brilliant.
What' s up?
William' s just turned down Anna Scott.
You daft prick.
No, no, it' s actually quite sensible.
That painting isn' t the original, is it?
Um, you know, I think it might be, yeah.
But she said she wanted to go out with you.
- Yeah.
- Well, that' s nice.
What?
Well, you know, anyone saying they wanna go out with you is pretty great, isn' t it?
It was... sort of... sweet, actually.
Um, I mean, I know she' s an actress and all that... so she can... deliver a line, but, um, she said she might be as famous as she can be, but also that she was... just a girl... standing in front of a boy... asking him... to love her.
Oh, sod a dog.
I' ve made the wrong decision, haven' t I?

There was a Miss Pocahontas, but she checked out about an hour ago.
I believe she' s holding a press conference at the Savoy... before flying to America.
We have liftoff.

I work for their in- house magazine.

- He' s with me.
Writing an article on how London hotels treat people in wheelchairs.
Yes, of course, madam.
It' s in the Lancaster Room.
Though I' m afraid you' re rather late.
Run!
Does this mean that Miss Scott will not be publicizing her next film?
No, it absolutely does not mean that.
She' il be abiding by all her present commitments.
She just won' t be making any more for the next year.
[Publicist]
At the moment, the plan is to release in America... towards the end of the autumn, and over here around Christmas or early in the new year.
Dominic.
Anna, how much longer are you staying in the U. K., then?
I leave tonight.
Which is why we have to round things up now, so final questions, please.
Lady there.
Is your decision to take a year off anything to do... with the rumors about Jeff and his present leading lady?
- Absolutely not.
- Do you believe the rumors?
Well, it' s really not my business anymore.
Though I will say, from my experience, rumors about Jeff do tend to be true.
The last time you were here, there were some fairly graphic photographs... taken of you with a young English guy.
So, uh, what happened there?
He was just a friend.
- [Reporters Clamoring]
- Right, um --
Gentleman in the pink shirt.
Yes.
Miss Scott, are there any circumstances in which... the two of you... might be more than just good friends?
I hoped there would be, but no, I' m... assured there aren' t.
- But what would you say if -- - Sorry.
Just the one question, please.
You were saying.
I was just wondering if, uh, it turned out that this person, uh -- [Man # 3]
- Thanks, thanks.
- [Laughter]
I just wondered whether if...
Mr. Thacker realized he' d been a daft prick... [Reporters Chattering] and got down on his knees and... begged you to reconsider, whether you would, in fact, then... reconsider?
- [Reporters Chattering]
Um --
The readers of Horse & Hound will be absolutely delighted.
Right.
Yeah?
Anna, how long are you intending to stay here in Britain?
Indefinitely.

America first fell in love with Eddie Thomas and Gwen Harrison...... in the box- office smash Autumn with Greg and Peg.
They had the most celebrated marriage in Hollywood.
who could forget how they hit one out of the park...... in Requiem for an Outfielder?
You can' t die, Mike.
You can' t.
Because I love you.
Justice never tasted so sweet...... as in The Bench.
I didn' t do it.
I' m innocent.
Why won' t anyone believe me?
- I object!
- You' re out of order!
No, you' re out of order!
I object to the way my client has been treated.
I object that I' ve let my professional judgment...... become clouded by my feelings for her.
I object to the way the room spins when she walks in.
I object, Your Honor, because I love this woman.
Theirlove opened our eyes...... in Sasha and the Optometrist.
Read from the top line, Sasha.
"I...... L- O- V- E...... Y- O --"
Oh.
You.
Dr. Martin!
Eddie Thomas and Gwen Harrison:
America' s sweethearts.
God, they were great.
Made my job cake.
I did the press for all nine movies.
Six did over $1 00 million.
They were on top of the world.
Then she blew it by dating that Spaniard.
- Did you cut this?
- No, Chad in marketing --
Always take credit.
That is survival rule number one.
Okay, I did it on my Mac.
Rule number two:
Don' t take credit until someone says they like it.
It' s not bad.
I hope this isn' t too awkward for you.
I know.
Kingman' s in the screening room.
He wants you to see something right away.
Please remind Mr. Kingman that he fired me last week.
And then invite him to kiss my undercarriage.
You' il want to see this, Lee.
- Hello, Dave.
- Lee.
- Thanks for coming.
- Why am I here?
You did fire me last week, so why am I here?
- Really?
Eddie and Gwen' s last movie.
You' ve seen it?
All of it?
How is it?
Would you roll that, please?
Be the first to see what only I have seen.
Something wrong?
Did the film break?
At least, I think it' s fine.
Wherever it is.
I spent 86 million dollars...... of the studio' s money...... on 20 seconds...... of titles.
The titles!
And a note.
"Dave, we could also do these in blue."
- We had to make a Weidmann film!
- He has three Oscars.
He' s a genius.
There' s only one genius in the business:
Señor Wences!
He had an 85- year career!
Huh?
Don' t talk to me about genius.
- Remember the nut in the woods?
- Ted Kaczynski.
- The guy at Fox?
- The Unabomber.
Remember he lived in that cabin?
So?
Hal Weidmann bought that cabin from the government...... and moved it onto his property.
That is where he edits his movies.
That is his little, twisted...... sicko office.
On the phone.
- Who?
- Hal.
I' il kill him!
That sick son- of- a- bitch bastard.
Put him on the speaker.
Hi, Hal.
How are you, darling?
You' re in my thoughts.
I want to send you a basket.
How' s the film?
- Finding its way.
- Could it find its way here?
We have a few things to do, like finish it.
It' s finished, Dave.
Great.
How is it?
My mother thinks it' s my best work.
- Can I speak with her?
- No, Dave.
- Can someone pick it up?
- No, Dave.
- You haven' t commented on the titles.
- I love them.
I have no notes.
- When' s the press junket?
Why?
I want the press to see it first. we' il experience it together at thejunket.
I' m the head of the studio.
I don' t experience things with the press.
- Wait!
Wait!
Hello?
God...... damn it!
- At the junket?
At the junket!
Lee, you have got to do this junket for me.
Set up a junket for a film you' re not sure you' il have?
- Yes.
- No!
Don' t make me beg.
- Lee, please.
Please, come on.
- No.
Danny cannot handle it.
I need the master.
You' re a legend at working the press.
- I want to stay a living legend.
- lf not for me, do it for my father.
You bonded.
- He was psychotic.
- You spoke at his funeral.
- I loved him.
You, I can' t stand.
- Do this for me.
The studio' s going under!
No hit in two years!
It may be the last Eddie and Gwen movie, and I can' t get my hands on it!
I' il tell you what I want.
lf people think Eddie and Gwen are reunited, they' il see the film.
- Make it happen.
Make it look like it could happen.
- He' s in some mountaintop nut hut.
- I don' t care!
I need Eddie and Gwen back together again, smiling and happy!
- We can sell it.
- And the Spaniard?
Unless I get a script called I Schtupped Castro, I don' t know.
- So what do you want?
- I want the golf cart.
- No, it was a gift from Arnold.
- I' m kidding.
- I can have anything?
Within reason.
I want my job back.
Keep me posted.
Yes.
You get them back together, you can have your job.
- Where are we booked?
- Four Seasons.
Book us in the middle of nowhere, where they can' t escape.
We need a hotel like the one in The Shining.
The new Hyatt in Nevada?
It' s in the desert.
Book it.
We have to keep the press entertained.
Let the press think it' s about them, not the movie.
Give them a lot to do: parties, hayrides, circle jerks.
Help them forget they haven' t seen the movie.
What about gifts?
The movie' s about a cop traveling in time, so I did a gun.
- It' s not real --
We' il do a bag.
Call the bag man.
Diamond earrings, money clips, chocolate truffles, perfume.
I don' t want this to be awkward for you, but I' ve got work to do.
- How will you get Eddie and Gwen there?
- I know somebody.
You' re just asking an awful lot.
Take the lilies out.
I understand.
Excuse me.
Could you please put that out?
Just warning you it' il be a bit of a fight.
I' il do what I can.
God help us.
When we come back from the break, you know the scenario.
- I' ve been here before.
- Look right at that camera.
- Right down the tube.
- Okay, five seconds.
Let' s go to the calls on Larry King Live.
- You' re on the air with Gwen Harrison.
- Hi, Larry.
Gwen, hi.
I used to be a big fan...... but I' m sorry, I can' t get over what happened with you and Eddie.
- Well....
You sleep next to a very handsome young Spanish gentleman, don' t you?
Let' s go to our next call.
Rock lsland, illinois, hello.
Gwen, I saw yourlatest movie.
- Thank you.
- I couldn' t sit through it. without Eddie, it' s not the same.
This has to be hard.
Your last two movies without Eddie...... tanked at the box office.
They were big in Europe and huge in Japan, actually.
Still, it must be tough.
Two duds in a row...... lots of intrigue, whispers, talk.
What happens if this one tanks?
I hate Larry King.
- I don' t want to breathe.
"Your last two movies tanked."
I wanted to choke him to death with those stupid suspenders.
- That' s not true.
The lighting was great.
Everybody said you looked great.
- You looked great.
- See?
- Thanks.
As if she really knows.
Water will make you feel better.
I only like the water with the electrolytes.
- Larry said you were amazing.
- Thank you.
I love Larry.
Let' s love him down to the dressing room.
- White.
And those glasses!
Who wears frames that big anymore?
He looks like a bug.
I just want this week to be over.
Why can' t the world accept that I don' t want to be with Eddie?
"Get a life!"
- I want this week to be over. ls it?
Push.
- Kiki!
- I' m sorry.
I smell smoke. ls somebody smoking?
- I don' t know.
- It' s probably Larry.
- How many heart attacks has he had?
- Six?
Maybe seven?
Can we just go?
I don' t want to be here anymore.
- Okay.
I got a call from Lee today.
Remember?
You got upset when Letterman didn' t air your show due to the Gulf War.
- I remember the toffee.
Great toffee.
We' il get you some when you meet with him to talk about the junket.
Do I have to?
- Meet with him?
Yes, you have to.
It' s not fair.
He' s probably having a ball.
This letter is a very important part of healing.
Writing your mom gives you the opportunity to thank her...... or forgive her or ask her why she did what she did.
But the act of putting it on paper frees you.
Allows you to let go.
Now, what did you say to your mother?
"Dear Mom:
Fuck you. "
Okay.
We' il try the letter some other time.
Are you comfortable speaking about Gwen?
- Think I should?
- There' s no "should."
- What is "can"?
There was this place in Chinatown.
Tiny little place.
They wouldn' t bother us there.
We' d get wonton soup and crumpled duck and sit there for hours, talking.
She took him there.
She took him to our crumpled duck.
I followed them and I saw him pouring the soup and smiling....
It was a total accident.
She told the press I tried to kill her.
She loves to overreact.
We have a saying, Edward.
What is that?
Bean salad?
What does that mean?
I don' t know what it means.
It' s very old.
I feel more secure.
A lot more secure.
Do I seem more secure?
You look great.
Whatever they' re doing, it' s working.
I' m in love.
They say two weeks here changes your life.
- When are two weeks up?
- Six months ago.
- But I' m getting close to something.
- I can see that.
- Did you watch Larry King last night?
- I was in the isolation tank.
The reason I bring it up is Gwen was on.
- She took kind of a beating.
- She did, did she?
You, young lady, are nobody without Eddie!
Nobody likes you!
Never go anywhere without Eddie.
You' re nothing!
- Get her out of here now!
Nothing!
- I' m so sorry, Larry.
I guess she got what she deserved.
Why are you here?
Kiss Gandhi goodbye, and let' s get ready for the junket.
- I' m not going!
I' m not ready.
- The studio and the movie need you.
I don' t care about the movie.
How is it?
Good?
I' ve only seen the beginning, but it' s fantastic.
Hold it up to your ear, you' il scream "Oscar."
- No, I' m not going.
- Gwen' il be there.
You want to see her?
- It' s a year and a half.
Get it over with.
She fell in love with another guy.
It happens.
Never to me, but if it did, I wouldn' t hide like some pussy!
I' m not a pussy.
I' m still getting treatment.
My wellness guide won' t let me just go.
- You sure?
You just said I was a flower in a stream, but a branch blocks my way.
You read too much into my words.
Listen to your heart.
- I' m the flower.
- You' re funny.
We' il miss you.
- Don' t forget to be grateful.
- I' m grateful.
I' m grateful for the sun. for the stars in the sky --
I' d be grateful if we could go.
- Okay.
I am the flower.
I' m the flower.
- Does he?
I want to thank you for all your help.
You' il get the car in 1 0 days.
- Convertible.
- Leather interior, fully loaded.
He' il get through this okay, right?
Life is a cookie.
Okay.
All right.
Come on, Eddie!
All right, buddy.
Ready to go?
Here we go.
- Does Gwen know I' m coming?
Absolutely.
She' s really excited.
Not in a million years.
lf that demented pig is there, no way.
- Eddie was temporarily insane.
- Don' t stick up for him.
- Kiki, look at you.
- Hi, Lee.
- Good.
- You look fabulous.
- Thanks.
- What did you do? ls it your hair?
- It' s my hair and a little sun.
She lost 60 pounds.
And I lost a little weight.
I see that.
Sixty pounds!
- Right?
Are you here to talk to me?
Of course.
I' m sorry.
Eddie' s not demented.
It was a one- time, forgive- and- forget thing.
He tried to kill me.
Am I the only one who remembers that?
Attempted murder doesn' t get attention anymore?
He was just so in love with you that he flipped out.
That' s true.
You sticking up for him again?
Gwen, your dog just swallowed your window- washer.
Puppy.
Your puppy' s a raptor.
- Prozac time.
Excuse me.
- She' s on Prozac?
The dog.
- Oh, the dog.
That' s not a bad thing.
- Hi, honey.
Here comes your sweaty big man.
- You' re sweaty.
- Who is this?
I' m Lee, press agent for Time Over Time.
- I' m not gonna sweep her off her feet.
- No, you' re too old.
Hector, honey.
Be good.
- I' m sorry.
He' s Spanish.
- No problem.
I was Spanish once myself.
Oh, I need kisses.
Oh, honey.
For why is he here now?
He wants me to go to the junket for the movie.
We could do that.
When?
We won' t take up any of your valuable time.
- I' m not invited?
- It' s the studio' s decision.
I don' t give a shit.
I go where Gwen goes.
We' re a couple.
Studio.
You' re so beautiful.
I love you so much.
We' re not going.
Eddie' il be there.
We won' t go because of him?
Listen.
We' re going to go...... and I' il personally protect you...... if that psycho asshole bastard tries to kill you again.
- We' re not going.
We' re going.
Everybody wants me to go, but nobody cares what I want!
- Nobody cares!
Don' t you know the stress I have?
Everyone hates me.
My shrink' s out of town.
Leave me alone.
Are you pleased with yourself?
I can' t even enjoy my shower now, Mr. Publicist- piece- of- shit.
Gwen is totally nuts.
- Cleared the room.
Well done.
- Talk to your sister.
At least she pretends to listen to you.
- Where is she?
- Grazing.
Nazi bastard.
Just kidding.
You need to go to this junket.
- Why not?
- I' m afraid.
Of...?
That I' il see Eddie and he' il be a mess.
I' il feel guilty.
I know.
I' m always thinking about other people.
I know you are.
I hate being the only one who cares about others.
lf they see Eddie down and sad, they' il pity him and blame me.
- So what you' re worried about is you.
- Of course.
Does everyone hate me, Kiki?
- No one hates you.
- Yes, they do.
I was in that great store on Melrose.
There was a baby in a stroller looking at me, and he was judging me.
The whole world is judging me for what I did to Eddie.
Look, I' il admit...... the Miss Adorable image has been called into question.
All the more reason to go.
Smile nice with Eddie for the weekend, win back audience goodwill.
- I do.
I could give Eddie the divorce papers.
- You sure you' re ready to do that?
- Why are you still questioning me?
- It' s Eddie.
He' d sing "Yellow Submarine" at the top of his lungs to make you laugh...... and save the mango in his fruit salad for you.
Eddie.
You' re just a romantic, Kiki.
You know nothing about married life.
You got me there.
I won' t be able to get through this on my own.
Can you help me?
I' il help you.
Good dog.
Get the paper.
Come on.
Come on.
- Help.
- Don' t let me interrupt.
What happened?
I' m packing her things because we' re going to a junket.
Great!
You' re a great sister.
- I' m a great assistant.
To the left.
- Okay.
People wrote I was on Zoloft, but this is holistic.
- Sure got a lot.
Bobby?
He wants you to pull over.
- Yeah, okay.
- Why are we stopping?
- I was told to.
So how you doing?
- Fine.
Why?
- I gotta hand it to you.
lf my lady left me for another guy, I' d swallow a gun.
I' d get drunk...... lay on the tracks and wait for a train.
Could we please not talk about that?
You know something?
People say I look like you.
But I project you.
I project the essence of you, like a you- ness.
- Can you put that partition up?
- Yes, sir.
How you doing?
How' s it going?
I was just getting a pep talk from my driver.
I' m orchestrating the hotel arrival.
Should you or Gwen pull up first?
- Where did you come from, man?
I' m riding with Gwen.
Gwen' s back there?
Yes.
So do you want to arrive first or second?
- Second.
- Be right back.
- Let him.
- He can go second.
- Great.
Wait.
He should go first.
I don' t want to look like his opening act.
I want to go second.
- Second it is.
- Fine.
Let her.
I don' t care.
From behind, she' il see the knife she stuck in my back.
- Second?
- Great.
- Who cares?
- She doesn' t care.
- Yes, I do.
I' m going first.
- I don' t care!
- I' m just trying --
- You' re second.
- I don' t care!
- I don' t care!
- You' re going second.
You' re going second.
- Okay, thank you.
That was easy.
- Drive the car!
I' m grateful for the sun.
I' m grateful for the moon.
I' m grateful for the cool...... cool night breeze.
It' s a happy night for Eddie and Gwen fans.
A year ago, America' s sweethearts went bust in dramatic fashion.
Here they come now.
Hi, Gwen, you look wonderful tonight.
- Can I get a shot?
Gwen, who' s a better lover?
Okay, right this way.
Eddie, here we go.
- What' s it like working with Gwen?
- I can' t remember.
That had to feel good.
It was good we went second.
Everybody loved you.
- What is this?
- Serenity tea from the Wellness Center.
I don' t know what' s in it, but it gets me calm and focused.
I can' t do this!
I told you this was a mistake.
She' s very close, right?
I feel her.
No, she' s in a cottage in the back.
I sensed it.
She' s close.
The cottages are way back on the property.
It' s so shocking.
You' re with somebody.
You think you' il spend your life -- She has a cottage and I get a suite?
- She has an entourage.
- Me too!
- I' m a schizo.
I' m my own entourage.
- Let me move you.
- No, it' s not important.
I' m grateful for this suite and minibar.
- The cottages are probably small.
- Actually, they' re...... tiny.
- It' s ridiculous.
- Good.
- Want to get room service?
I' il take some herbs, numb out, have a shower and go to bed alone.
- You' ve been great.
- What did I do?
Showed up.
That' s enough.
Rest, I don' t want you puffy.
- What?
Some guy' s whacking it near cottage number 4.
Oh, that' s....
That' s disgusting.
I don' t want to deal with this now.
Every time I get this shift, there' s always some sicko.
I can' t catch a break around here.
Sir, I' m sure things are different in L. A...... but in Nevada, we prosecute public masturbation.
- I' ve been in Las Vegas -- - I was not --!
- We saw you on our cameras.
- I was pulling out the prickers!
I' m trying to put out a fire.
- I fell into a cactus.
- He fell into a cactus.
That' s it.
Unless you usually arrest those who bump into succulents...... l suggest we call it a night.
We still have to fill out a report --
I' m not supposed to do this, but....
I have beautiful bags that are exclusive for the press.
Got girlfriends?
We have real diamond earrings.
Very delicate.
- I saw the bags.
They' re nice.
Very nice.
The highest quality.
- We don' t have to file a report.
- Because I didn' t do anything, morons!
Usually he' s like a pussycat.
- All right?
Okay.
Fellas, one other thing.
I need the tape from the security camera...... just in case something gets out, all right?
Danny will go with you to get the tape, all right?
Thank you, fellas.
Appreciate a lot.
- Rent- a- cops.
You got me on the edge.
- What were you doing there?
I just wanted to see her again.
I saw her standing by the pool, and she looked so fantastic.
I just miss her.
Don' t give me that look.
I know that look.
It means trouble.
Go to your room, go to bed and stay out of trouble.
- I wasn' t getting in trouble!
- No, no.
- Just whacking off on a cactus.
- I wasn' t!
It looks as ifEddie Thomas...... may change his name to "Peeping" afteran incident at the Hyatt.
This tape clearly shows Thomas...... in the words of one hotel guard, "doing himselfa big favor"...... outside his estranged wife' s cottage.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Thomas is in town fora pressjunket for the new Eddie and Gwen movie.
Sources say this latest incident is not surprising...... given Thomas' delicate mental state since his split with Gwen.
- Know what the movie' s about?
- By the looks ofit...... we' re looking at a remake ofCool Hand Luke.
It was on the news!
He was outside doing something not good!
Gwen, everybody does it.
I know everyone does it.
That' s not the point.
What is going on?
ls he trying to kill me again?
With the weapon he had in hand, I doubt it.
Other chains, yes.
But the Hyatt, no.
Get some rest.
Somebody has to be beautiful tomorrow.
I know.
I have to go.
Good night.
Eddie, I am so pissed off!
I have the tape!
They had a copy!
Bastards.
Everybody' s got a price.
Hold on just a second, it' s room service.
No, it' s just -- Hold on one second.
Put it over there.
That is beluga, right?
Yeah, thanks.
We' re fine.
It' s all local.
Nothing national.
They' il issue a retraction tomorrow.
You' re fine.
There' s no damage.
It' s what you said.
It' s in the past.
The beach grass grows toward the sun in the universe you' re grateful for.
Get some rest.
Someone has to look handsome tomorrow.
Okay, Mr. Big Time?
See you in the morning.
- Do you like Eddie?
- I love him.
- You leaked the tape.
- Survival rule number three:
You' re not here to love.
You' re here to promote.
That' s it.
Period.
You get word your mother died, hit by a bus or something.
You go downstairs, shed a tear and say:
"It' s a shame.
She would' ve loved this movie. "
I gotta talk to Eddie.
I' m worried about him.
- You do that.
- Go get him for me.
- Me?
- I have to talk to him tonight.
Or I' il be up all night and look terrible tomorrow.
Really puffy.
I don' t think....
- I can' t.
- Why not?
Because I' m sleeping.
And because I just....
I feel funny getting in the middle of things with the two of you.
- Can' t you handle this yourself?
- What?
I don' t handle anything myself.
- I' m not.
That' s all.
Please, Kiki.
Please.
Please, please, please, please, Kiki- Kiki- Ki.
God!
Your pillow' s better than mine.
Take it.
How are you?
My marriage is shit and I make crappy films.
I' m sorry.
- Why' s she doing this?
- I don' t know.
- I like your movies.
- They' re shit, come on.
- What' s going on?
She say anything?
- I' m shocked.
I really am shocked.
- I didn' t know.
- I' m not perfect...... but I thought we had something.
I know.
He' il sit in my chair, watch my TV...... walk my dog, sleep in my bed with my....
I don' t know what happened.
Well, it' s not you.
lf she can' t see that, she' s blind.
- You are wonderful.
- I don' t feel wonderful.
It' il be okay.
I don' t think so.
But thanks for saying that.
- Thanks for coming.
You' re sweet.
- No, you are.
No, you are.
You' re a good friend.
You' re a rock.
- Come here!
You too.
- You look good.
- Misery agrees with me.
- Thank you.
You' ve been getting healthy.
You lifting a little weights?
Not lifting weights so much as losing weight.
- You always looked good to me.
- Want something to drink?
- I' m fine.
Sit down.
I saw you last --
That night.
I feel terrible about that.
That was the low point.
I' d found out about Hector.
I took advantage of the situation.
Talk about bottoming out.
I was drunk.
I think I kissed you.
Did l?
- I don' t recall.
- lf I was inappropriate, forgive me.
- Sure.
Yeah.
- Thanks, Keek.
Are you okay?
A few hours ago, no.
But something incredible happened tonight.
I was walking by the cottages, and it was like Gwen was drawing me to her.
There she was, standing by the pool, all dressed in white...... like an angel in the desert.
I thought:
"That' s why you' re here.
To win her back. "
No way she' il stay with Hector.
I' m supposed to spend the rest of my life with her.
Really?
The woman by the pool?
- That' s why I' m here.
- What do you mean?
- Pebbles and Bamm- Bamm are rocking out. - what?
Kiki and Eddie left.
- Why' d you say that?
It' s fun!
I wonder what she wants.
I don' t know what she wants.
It' d be good to know.
I know what I want.
Siegfried and Roy are heading for the pool.
- Siegfried and Roy?
- Not the real Siegfried --
You wanted to play this game.
Heads, we stay apart.
Tails, we reunite.
- You need to flip a coin?
- Yes.
Here we go.
One, two, three.
- A possible possum.
Wait, not here.
Felix, this is Oscar.
The monkey is in daycare.
Your mystery date awaits.
Wish me luck.
I' m sorry.
I' m so sorry.
I know you' il never forgive me, but please, please take me back.
That a gun in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?
Actually, it' s a gun.
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hi, Gwen.
- Have you been?
That happens when your wife shacks up with someone else.
I understand.
Get that out.
Just shake it out.
Throw it away.
- That' s great advice.
Thank you.
- Ask me what?
- When we did the movie...... did you fool around?
You' ve got no right to ask me that.
I wasn' t fooling around.
- The girl who played your daughter?
- What' s wrong with you?
- You' re very hostile.
- I can' t imagine why.
This was a mistake.
- It wasn' t.
- It was.
Tomorrow...... let' s be professional and promote this movie...... because we both need this one to do well.
I know you do.
And if they ask about the breakup, we say that it was a difficult time...... that we' re working through it together.
- Fine.
- Good.
I have to go.
- See you tomorrow.
- You' re not ev --?
- Here.
There you go.
- Thanks.
ls this a scene from theirnew movie?
No, that' s Gwen and Eddie dancing in the moonlight forreal.
- What the hell' s going on?... in a passionate embrace.
Goddamn it!
My life is so stressful.
People have no idea what it' s like being me.
See?
I can' t even remember that.
Good morning, you two.
Come on, smile.
Here we go.
Ladies and gentlemen, Eddie and Gwen, together again!
There they are!
America' s sweethearts!
What' s this?
Only five minutes?
Mention jerking off, I' il pull your plug.
It' s plenty of time to talk about a movie I haven' t seen.
Do you need anything?
- Doesn' t she look great?
- Who?
Your sister looks incredible.
- Are you trying to make me jealous?
- Would that be possible?
Then why care if I try?
Okay, who' s happy?
Ready to go?
Always a pleasure.
Byron, it' s all yours.
Byron Allen, coming to you from EntertainmentStudios. com.
Strap yourself in.
I' m with America' s sweethearts:
Ready for this?
They' re not trying to kill each other.
Are you back together?
You look very comfortable.
I' il be honest.
Before I came down from the room...... l took about a pound of Vicodin.
I' il be comfortable till late March.
You' re funny.
How do you live with him?
She doesn' t.
She lives with someone else.
Must' ve been exciting working with Hal Weidmann.
Oh, no.
No, Hal' s brilliant.
He' s so easy to work with.
Just loves actors.
You had a nervous breakdown recently, didn' t you?
What?
Can audiences watch you without recalling your attack on Ms. Harrison?
That' s five minutes.
Thank you.
It was so great meeting you guys.
I' m a huge fan.
Lunch?
Why does he get a neck- rub?
- I want one.
Hello?
I have a neck too.
This thing holding up my head.
And we' re back.
- Everybody ready?
- Of course.
Hello again, Syracuse.
Mort Josephson, your Movie Maven.
Ann Arbor, I' m Laura Messinger, the Cinemaniac.
- Popcorn' s buttered.
- Lights dim.
- And Ken.
At the Multiplex.
We' re great friends.
We talk every day.
We' re better friends than ever.
We talk two, three times a day.
We' re just cosmically, spiritually bound.
Eddie' s really good...... and he' s my pillar of strength.
It' s like Sodom and Gomorrah.
And that' s five.
ln spite of all the emotion and hurt...... we leaned on each other for support.
That' s when I realized how strong our friendship really was.
- Right.
I mean, not only are we great friends...... and not only are we in constant contact --
You should see our phone bills.
We' ve also done --
I don' t know, how should I put this?
Hell, I' il just say it.
We' ve done a few three- ways.
This guy she' s with now....
I can' t say I' m happy.
She' s my wife.
But after spending time in the sack with him, I see the attraction.
But for a fairly big guy, he' s not packing much south of the border.
And that' s five minutes.
Thank you so much.
Say hi to everybody in Salt Lake.
Good to see you.
- Hi, guys!
- Hi, guys.
- It was a joke.
- I do that after 400 interviews.
- Hector won' t find it funny.
I don' t give a shit what he thinks.
Take a picture with my baby?
Just smile and shut up.
- Who has?
You.
It' s been a great day.
- What do you want?
- A small favor.
45 minutes, an hour.
I need you to have dinner with Gwen.
- It' il be great.
- I won' t do it.
- You should do this.
- I' m gonna be alone with the minibar.
We' re in deep shit.
Hal' s holding the film hostage.
We have nothing!
Understand?
But I do have you.
You and Gwen.
When you' re together, the press forgets that.
It' s roses blooming, flags flying, pudding --
- Are you on something?
- A panic high.
Just order an entrée, chew a little bit, smile and go.
They have delightful pork tenderloin.
8: 00.
Thank you so much!
- Really?
Absolutely.
I can' t believe you said I' d have dinner.
They serve a very nice pork tenderloin.
I' m not going.
I was with him enough today for the rest of my life.
- When?
Just before we leave.
What, toss them at him as your limo pulls away?
You don' t understand.
It' s very complicated.
Being nice makes giving him the papers easier, but then he gets hopeful.
- Sorry.
Pedicure.
Hello?
- So when you' re nice, he thinks -- - I can' t talk about it right now.
It' s so hard being someone people just don' t get over.
- Tell him I have a headache.
- I won' t lie for you.
- You lie for me all the time.
This is high school all over again.
When you wanted to break up with a boyfriend, I had to do it.
- Oh, please.
Let' s refresh your memory.
Robert Mancuta?
Kyle Hassler?
Half the lacrosse team?
That' s untrue.
My quote in the yearbook was, "Hey, we have to talk." I was hated.
Fine.
Don' t go.
Eddie will sit there like an idiot, and it' il be all your fault.
Whatever.
- Lee.
- Where' s the film?
- What?
ln its canister, waiting to be shown, to go into history.
There is no film.
What have I seen five times that gave me the best feeling ever?
You' il have a great time.
See you later.
We' re dead, we' re doomed.
Thank you.
Look at you.
- Thanks.
- What' s going on?
Gwen isn' t feeling well, so she won' t make it to dinner.
- She isn' t sick.
- Not physically.
- Thanks.
Really.
Wanna join me?
Haven' t you read the papers?
I' m unstable.
Come on.
- Yeah.
We have an understudy.
They never make it easy, do they?
The house phone, please.
- Holly Golightly' s cottage, please.
Gwen' s code name.
From Breakfast at Tiffany' s.
- What' s that?
- It' s a movie, a great movie.
- Right.
Katharine.
Listen to me.
Thank you.
Hey, Gwen, it' s Lee.
I' m at the restaurant, and guess what?
You' re not.
Are you okay?
Oh, that' s too bad.
Eddie' s with Kiki.
She looks unbelievable.
It' s a bit "Hello, Young Lovers."
I may have some fires to put out, but that' s my problem.
Have a nice night.
Feel better.
Okay.
Bye.
Five minutes.
- Take notes.
"This is Larry Flange.
I' m sitting with the lovely and talented Kiki Harrison.
You play a lesbian firefighter on an oil rig.
One word comes to mind:
Typecasting.
Your thoughts? "
You really want my thoughts?
- Larry.
"Okay, Larry...... the truth is...... after playing Madame Curie...... and discovering radium...... l just thought it would be a hoot to strap on those big rubber boots...... kiss my favorite gal goodbye and go fight some fire."
- A very personal role for you.
- Very close to my heart.
You' re funny.
Yeah.
Do you remember Silent Run?
We rented that go- cart?
You attacked the director --
- There was no attacking.
- You rammed him repeatedly.
- You rammed me.
- Ramming you was a different thing.
And you rammed Gwen.
She was not laughing, and we were.
- She was pissed.
- That memory kept popping in my head.
- Those were good times.
- I' m sorry I didn' t call you.
- She' s your sister.
I understand.
I let myself get kind of --
- It' s good to see you now.
- It' s good to see you now.
That' s a nice necklace.
- It' s not really mine.
- I know.
- It' s Gwen' s.
- I know.
- She gave it to me.
- And I gave it to her.
I know.
- It looks good on you, though.
- Thank you.
What are you thinking?
I' m thinking something I shouldn' t be thinking about.
- Me too.
What were you thinking about?
- How much I want that breadstick.
You want to eat this?
No, I don' t eat bread.
I just dream about bread.
I' ve been doing a lot of dream analysis since I cracked up --
- At the center.
And I believe...... bread represents something you want but can' t have.
What do you think?
Well, I think that when I dream about bread...... that would represent...... bread.
Pretty much.
What are you thinking about?
Gwen...... is here.
Sorry I' m late.
- Thought you were ill.
- All better.
Just like that.
- Thanks.
You can go.
- She doesn' t have to go.
- Good to see you.
- Right away.
I hear they have great pork tenderloin.
- She didn' t have to go.
You look great too.
- What' s the name?
- What' s he doing here?
Get a camera.
Film, tape, anything.
Go!
It' s Gwen Harrison.
- Lee.
We met the other day.
- Where is Gwen?
- I want to see her.
- I won' t get involved.
How do we stop people in love?
What are you talking about?
I want to see her now.
I can' t cover for them anymore.
They' re in the restaurant.
They' re right over there.
She' s in the red dress.
- Hector!
- That' s all right.
- Don' t wave at him like that.
- I promote my movies.
- I know.
I apologize.
- I' m sorry.
- Hector.
- I apologize for him too.
- He' s here.
Get in.
Would you get out of the way?
- What are you doing?
- Protecting the woman I love.
- I' il let you two catch up.
- Why don' t you be quiet!
- I' il get to you soon.
- Don' t point.
Don' t tell me what to do.
- I trust you implicitly.
It' s this asshole I don' t trust!
What?
What did you say?
I hope he' s not making fun of my accent.
Okay, enough!
You guys enjoy your little public display!
I' m leaving.
Okay, pussy boy' s leaving.
What' s wrong?
You don' t like that?
Tall boy.
Come on.
What are you --?
- Let' s go.
Please, make my day.
You' re a genius, beyond my wildest expectations.
Tracking' s up.
This is good!
Hit him!
Hit him!
- Anybody.
- I won' t fight!
- You' re a pussy boy.
- I' m trying to find some peace.
- You want peace?
Okay, he wants peace.
- Pussy boy' s leaving.
- Don' t do that.
- Hector, don' t.
- Don' t tell me "don' t."
Maybe you want a piece of me.
You see?
Huh, pussy?
I really don' t think there should be a problem here.
After all...... you took my wife and I tried to kill you.
We' re even.
Punk!
Eat this, punk!
Eat it!
I love your work.
You forgot something.
- Shut up.
- Why' d you have to do that?
Did you see that?
I can feel my nose in the back of my throat. ls that bad?
Can you hear me?
I swear to God, Gwen can be just horrible.
How can you love someone and not like them at the same time?
Seems strange.
- You need to lie down.
- I thought I was.
Why don' t we try sitting down?
There we go.
Let me have a look.
- No?
Cold.
- What happened?
- I needed another humiliating photo op.
I tried to walk away, but he kept pushing.
So I hit him in the tray with my face.
I should' ve walked away.
For some reason, these days, I do the stupid thing.
This doesn' t look good.
- What was that?
- Another stupid thing.
Stupid and maybe verging on crazy or...?
It' s a fine....
There he is.
The master!
I' il have what he' s having.
I have to say, you have completely outdone yourself.
ln 24 hours, we' ve had a walk in the woods...... a romantic dinner and a fistfight.
I can' t wait to see what happens next.
You like that?
Let me think about it.
It won' t help initial release but video will go like crazy.
- We could do a box like a coffin.
That' s good.
No, wait.
lmagine if he killed himself at the premiere.
I' m joking.
I' m thinking out loud or whatever.
- Good night, Dave.
- Good night, Lee.
Good work!
Good morning.
I feel -- I feel --
I feel good.
- You?
- I feel something along those lines.
Good, weird.
Weird, good.
Here' s what I was thinking.
What about breakfast?
We' il take it from there.
Why don' t you order some breakfast?
I' il brush my teeth first.
- Can I use your toothbrush?
- Yeah, it' s in there.
Can I get some juice?
Keek?
Hello?
Where are you?
Want some toast?
You buttered my toast.
No one' s done that before.
I don' t eat toast with butter -- I don' t eat toast.
I' il stop talking now and make an exception.
Want some tea?
Okay.
- Thank you.
No, I' m fine.
I look like half a raccoon.
What' s up?
Now' s not a good time.
Can we do it later?
No, don' t come here.
I' il come there.
Bye.
That was Gwen.
- She wants to talk.
- About what?
I don' t know, she didn' t say.
But I better...
-... go over there.
- Why didn' t you say you' d talk later?
She said she' d come here, and I thought...... that' s not a good idea so I better go over there, given the situation.
- Will you tell her about last night?
- I don' t know.
I' il just let her talk.
Know what I mean?
Sounds like it' s important so I' il let her say it.
Then I' il go do these dumb interviews.
I' il come back and we' il lunch together.
Does that sound good?
You look terrible.
- Does it hurt?
- Only when I' m awake.
- He' s not here.
- Who?
- Hector.
- That doesn' t matter. ls Kiki here?
I doubt it.
- I don' t know where that girl is.
- That girl is here.
Nice of you to join us.
Where have you been?
Things to do.
Nothing important.
Would you make scrambled eggs?
She makes great scrambled eggs.
- Would you like some?
- Two orders.
Make mine runny.
- Let' s get room service.
It would be my pleasure.
What did you want to talk about?
I think you' re doing pretty well, huh?
- Are you feeling okay?
- Yeah, I' m better.
I' m shocking myself.
"I forgot how charming you were."
"You, Miss Julep, are a warm breeze on a cool afternoon."
What was that? "what was that?"
- I don' t know.
What was that movie called?
I don' t give a shit!
- No, that wasn' t it.
- You look like you' re in a good place.
When I saw you and Hector, I was so conflicted.
Conflicted is the word du jour.
There' s no question about that.
You know what that is?
She' s tired.
- Excuse me?
- Are you seeing anybody?
- Let me think about it.
Not....
You know....
- Not technically, no.
- What?
Not technically!
That' s fascinating.
That' s sad.
Really, that' s a shame.
Your eggs, darling sister.
I hope they' re runny enough.
Son of a bitch!
There you go!
- A lot, actually.
I can' t believe it' s taken so long to figure out.
I' m going for a long walk to simmer down.
First, I' d like to cut through the shit.
He' s not technically dating because he' s technically hung up on you.
You moron!
She' s only here to salvage her precious career...... and serve you with divorce papers.
I' ve done all I can do.
Leaving is just something I' ve really perfected, so...... once more, with feeling.
- She was more fun when she was fat.
- What?
- About the papers.
Yes, but now I don' t know.
Seeing you, being in front of the press with you -- We have something.
Maybe I' ve made a horrible, horrible mistake.
I don' t know.
You' re the devil.
- I want to talk.
Hold on a minute.
- Let go of me.
- I want to talk.
- I don' t!
- Why not?
- You' re an idiot.
I' m an idiot too!
ln that respect, we belong together.
- It' s a complicated situation.
- I' il un- complicate it!
Forget about what happened between us.
It' s not gonna work, all right?
Last night?
Last night was great.
But she calls you, and you can' t wait to get to her!
What is that?
It won' t work.
You' il probably always think of her...... and I' il probably always wonder if you' re thinking of her.
I just --
- What?
That woman that you saw by the pool --
That woman you just have to spend the rest of your life with....
That was me.
- Morning.
So here' s the buffet.
What' s going on?
Nothing.
I' m great.
Just great.
Ma' am, can I get some more butter?
When you hit Formica, stop.
You know the expression "falling off the wagon"?
But you got 30 pounds of food to break your fall.
- What the hell happened?
- Bad morning.
Preceded by 33 bad years.
- Does this have to do with Gwen?
- Of course not.
I love my sister.
I love everything about her.
Kiki- kins?
Who' s smoking?
I smell smoke.
ls someone smoking within a six- mile radius of me?
Stop them, Kiki. "
Oh, ma' am, the butter?
There' s no butter?
How can you run out?
- I have one theory.
- I need an assistant.
lf I had one, she' d be outside milking a cow...... and I' d never run out of butter.
"My butter has touched another food.
I need new butter. "
That' s how it goes.
You know.
Anything they want, right?
She' s got a green dress.
Looks like crap on her.
Brings out the bags under her eyes.
It looks nice.
Then she said she wanted it back.
She doesn' t want me to have it.
So you' re in love with Eddie?
- Wouldn' t that be stupid?
- I' ve done every one of their movies.
He never looks at her the way he looks at you.
lf you' re in love, just go for it.
The way you went for this breakfast.
That' s --
I think I' m gonna be sick.
Can you just....
I' il take all of this to go.
I' il need 30 bags and a forklift.
No laugh, no tip.
I want to play someone like the Terminator.
I think the Hispanic people are crying out to see...... a deadly, destructive killing machine they can embrace.
- That they can relate to.
- Nice to see you.
How are you?
Hal here yet?
He' s a dead man.
No, I' m serious.
I know a guy.
I' il make a call, and he' s dead, because....
How are you?
Hope you' re having a good time.
- What time is it?
- 1 2: 50.
We' re doomed.
May I suggest that you follow my lead and get completely shitfaced?
- Hi, how are you?
You look gorgeous.
- Hi, Mr. K. Thank you.
How long must I stay with the people?
They' re drunk and touching me.
Wait. lf Hal doesn' t bring the film, they' il be busy building a gallows.
ls that pussy boy?
- He' s gonna jump.
- He' s not.
- I said I' d give him divorce papers.
- Excuse me.
Let' s take advantage of this.
Get some shots.
Okay.
- Jump, jump.
- Jump, pussy, jump.
- I can' t believe this.
- He' il be a pussy pancake.
- I' m coming!
Why' s he doing this to me?
- I' m sorry!
You okay?
- What are you doing?
- I was stopping you from jumping!
- By killing me?!
- Stay right there!
- Where am I gonna go?
Right!
Oh, shit.
Hang in there, Eddie!
I' m coming!
- You' re hosing me down?
One, two, three.
Pull yourself up.
Come on.
Good.
- Got it?
- Yeah.
That' s it.
One foot at a time.
- I' m gonna kill you.
Take a bow.
It' il look better.
Jesus Christ.
Next time, take a hair dryer into the tub.
- I wasn' t killing myself.
- Then what?
I came here to think. ls that a crime?
Do that in your room!
I blew it.
I lost her.
Guy goes to his rabbi.
He says, "Rabbi, my wife is trying to poison me."
Rabbi says, "I' il talk to her."
He comes back and says, "I spoke to your wife for three hours.
Take the poison. "
You and Gwen are over.
- I don' t care about Gwen!
- I' m talking about Kiki.
She' s the only one worth spending any time with in this hellhole.
No offense.
You have some nice qualities.
But for a review, you' d sell me for medicine.
- Too late.
Trust me.
I' m telling you --
- It is?
He' s here with the film!
We' re saved!
- We' re beyond saving.
- You wanna see the film?
- I don' t care.
- This could put you back on top.
- You think?
On top?
- "May I have the envelope, please?"
It' s Hal.
Hal!
- He' s got the film.
Go, go.
- He' s the director.
- He looks great.
Let' s get started.
I' m Lee Phillips.
Welcome to Time Over Time.
Thank you.
I' il go out on a ledge here and say....
I couldn' t help myself.
Welcome the man responsible for this junket, Dave Kingman.
Thank you very much.
They say that good things come to those who wait.
I waited 20 years to work with the great Hal Weidmann.
- Hal' s cinematic influence has been -- - That' s good.
Thank you.
My name is Hal Weidmann.
Hello.
Ladies and gentlemen...... this is the most honest movie I have ever made.
I wasn' t looking for it.
It came to me like a bus in the street.
Or the woman who changes the flowers at our desert house.
I can' t talk about this film without weeping.
Roll it.
Thank you, Hal.
Have a great time, everybody!
Sarah.
I' m Ben. we must speak. - who are you?
- That' s unimportant. what' s important now is yoursafety.
You' re in danger.
This is hard to say, so I' iljust say it.
- I' m from the future.
- Oh, my God!
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.
Now, Sarah, please.
Love is a bridge built between two people. we want what exists between them to be real.
My name is Hal weidmann.
The film you' re about to see is Time Over Time, oris it?
The details are unimportant.
I tossed it.
- Just watch.
I filmed my actors without theirknowledge.
I let the camera run after takes.
I placed hidden cameras around.
And the end result is a story...... farmore involving than anything manufactured by actors and writers.
This is real life.
Thejuice.
The stink.
The glory.
Often, you wonder where the budget goes.
Shut up!
It' s gonna be good.
I don' t mean to pressure you, but we' re 15 days over.
- Oh, no. - what are we gonna do?
I' m in the middle ofshooting.
It' s a sensitive time.
Go away.
Please.
Never visit my set again.
Watch him take it...... up the gazoo.
You' re an idiot.
I told you we nevershould' ve hired him.
You' re so good in this.
Cut.
- Hal, can I get like three minutes?
- Gwen, can I talk to you?
- I' m working.
- Nothing.
- His hands are all overyourass.
- My character would' ve done that.
- You look like a prostitute!
- Oh, please.
- Don' t make a fool ofme.
- Cut it out.
You hearme?
- Cut it out.
- Do you hearme?!
- I think Eddie knows.
- Knows what?
About me and Hector.
- You said nothing was happening. - well, something happened.
- What the hell is this?
- You think I know?
- You see it?
- I slept with him.
- Hector?.
- Are you in love?
- Come on.
It' s not always about love.
Sometimes youjust need a lay.
I tell you, he' s hot.
Handsome.
He can go forhours.
Just wish he had a bigger, you know, thingy.
I love this movie. what do you mean?
It' s like a roll of quarters.
It' s like this.
- Okay.
I' m gonna scream.
- I think it' s very entertaining.
- Lee, get over here!
You stop this right now.
I' il sue the studio.
- Lower your voice.
- Shut up.
- Excuse me.
Was that deserved?
I think so.
You' ve ruined me.
You' ve ruined my career.
Look at the screen.
Don' t you realize what that is?
That' s reinvention.
That' s birth.
That' s life itself.
Can' t you smell the life?
Pretty soon you' il smell lra Stern, my attorney!
- Thank you, Hal.
- Wacko.
The film' s new direction caught some of us a little bit off- guard.
- I am shocked.
I' m outraged.
- There are textures!
Can I say something, please?
What was said about my penis is completely false.
I' m extremely well- hung.
I' il submit to an inspection.
I knew this film would be misunderstood.
Godard.
I' il kick your ass!
Understand that!
- Who are you?
- Who am l?
- I' m your ass- kicker!
- Can I defend my dad?
No.
- Hal.
- No, you cannot!
Let me defend Hector.
We had sex.
His penis is bigger than a roll of quarters.
- No.
- You slept with her?
- I swear she' s lying.
The part about my penis is true.
It' s bigger than coins.
There will be a lawsuit. lnvasion of privacy, damage to my career!
Yes, yes, I know.
Congratulations.
It' s my most honest work.
- I got a script.
- You' re great.
I have an announcement to make.
I' d like to thank you all.
I' m so happy you' re here and all our friends in the press...... who' ve been so supportive this last year.
I' m so happy to say...... that Eddie and I are getting back together.
So thank you all so much.
- What is this bullshit now?
- Be quiet.
Bullshit!
Today, Eddie came to the cottage.
We had breakfast and a heartfelt talk, didn' t we, honey?
I' ve wanted to get back together with Gwen...... ever since we weren' t together anymore.
I' ve obsessed about it.
- How sweet.
- Now that it' s happened, I must say...... l' m amazed and grateful.
And I agree with Hector that it' s bullshit.
- We did.
Don' t you love me?
I love the bright, sexy woman up on- screen.
- The movie girl.
That' s not you.
You' re good at pretending to be real.
I think I' m with the real you, but I' m not.
I' m with the real you, not the movie you.
I don' t want that.
- I just explained it.
- You did?
- I don' t want to talk.
- Not in front of these -- - Why not?
What could I have to say to you that I don' t have to say...... in front of 300 international press members.
I' il tell you why.
I' m in love with your sister.
ls this some kind ofjoke?
Kiki, could you get over here?
- Why her?
- Oh, why not?
ls it so unbelievable that a man could love me?
- Not now.
- You just wait for me!
- Can I say something?
Listen.
Okay, one nut at a time.
I love you.
You should know nothing happened between me and Eddie until last night.
I feel much better about you stealing my husband.
Ex- husband.
I didn' t steal anything.
You' re the one shacked up for the past year with Ricky Ricardo.
Look, I am just tired of making excuses.
I am done picking up dirty clothes.
I am done pretending...... that your life is my whole life.
I' m just....
I' m done.
So what you' re really worried about is you, right?
Well, I guess you' re fired.
Honey.
You know all I care about is your happiness.
That' s sweet --
So don' t worry about me.
I' il be fine.
- You' re unbelievable.
- Shut up.
Next?
What can I do for you?
I shouldn' t have said that in front of everybody, but --
I' ve been searching for clarity.
All of a sudden I am so clear, it' s ridiculous.
- I want to be with you.
- When did you decide this?
The moment I thought I' d lost you.
- Damn it.
- What?
That was good.
No.
No, this is crazy.
Eddie, this isn' t gonna work.
Listen to me.
I' m grateful for you.
ln all the world, the thing I' m most grateful for is you.
- lf that' s a line from your movie -- - That one' s mine.
- What do we do now?
- Traditionally...... we kiss.
Thank you.
Step back, please.
Easy, easy.
I' m on pain medication...... that makes me say things I' d never say otherwise.
To set the record perfectly straight...... Eddie and I never had any plans to reconcile.
And?
And Hector is very well- endowed.
Almost too well- endowed.
Literally.
- What are you doing?
- Packing.
- Let me help you with that.
- That' s okay.
That' s -- No, really -- Folding!
Let somebody help you for once.
There you are.
That was unbelievable.
Like a movie with a stage show.
lf you' d tour with the film, we' d be rich.
And your sister is unbelievable.
The entire country has voted her off the island but, no!
She' s back!
I' ve never seen anything like it.
They like the film!
They call it The BlairBitch Projecf!.
But the best news is you two.
Want a drink?
- We' re on our way out.
We don' t know.
Once in a while, good things happen.
I' il see you.
There' s a car, so you can dodge the press.
But I' il need you!
This one will work!
Hi.
Can I explain why I didn' t call?
(young man) Looking at this picture, I know you might be thinkin ':
"Sure looks like a lonely place to be, way up there."
If indeed you were, I' d have to disagree.
Truth is, when you stop to ponder it, there' s really no such thing as a lonely place,..... just lonely people.
That' s what I believe.
You can be lonely any place: up on a rooftop, at a big family shindig,..... in a football stadium, with 60, 000 other humans all around,..... or even in a small town, like Shelbyville, Indiana.
Now, I' m not sayin 'there' s anything wrong with it.
In fact, loneliness is what ensures the propagation of our species.
I think that' s why most people get married.
Because they' re lonely, horny or out of money.
But mostly cos they' re just damn lonely.
Of course, that is one hell of a milk- toast reason..... to link up with one person for the rest of your existence.
But people do it every day.
They give in to their loneliness.
And the next thing they know, they' re trapped.
Perhaps I' m being too picky.
I talked to this counsellor once.
He told me that the fact I was raised in an orphanage..... has rendered me afraid of abandonment, and therefore fearful of commitment.
Now, you can tell by my tone, I don' t think much of his opinion.
I' m ready to commit, just as soon as I find that one woman I can' t live without.
That one woman that gives me goose bumps all over.
I simply refuse to settle for anything less, like most people seem to do.
Like my boss, Larry.
(whistles) Be a sport, will ya?
I missed Ruthie' s birthday dinner last night and she' s makin 'my life hell in a handbasket.
I know she' il go easier on me if you' re there.
Do me this.
She' il love that.
- What the hell is this?
It' s a Russian Pomeranian, Larry.
Nah, I don' t wanna put any American dogs outta work.
Come on now, Gilly.
Come on over.
- I don' t know, Larry.
Last time I...
- Thanks, buddy.
A slice of family life and home cookin 'will do your heart good.
We' il make it a wingding.
(Gilly) This is fine cuisine, Mrs P.
It' s takeout, Gilly.
From Pizza Hut.
- Larry hates my cooking.
You know I...
- That' s why he never comes home for dinner.
- I' m out there busting my ass.
If you' re busting your ass, how come it' s the size of a goddamn beanbag chair?
If you put out once in a while, maybe I wouldn' t be seeking carnal pleasure in food.
All right!
Call me old- fashioned,..... but I don' t think a child should be made to picture her parents humping.
- I don' t tell you about my sex life.
- You' re not having sex.
- Are you having sex?
- Cher, tell Daddy you' re kidding.
She' s kidding.
She doesn' t even have a boyfriend.
You don' t need to have a boyfriend to be having sex.
I' m just saying that a boy doesn' t have to be a friend to be nibbling my package.
Are you...?
- Buddy!
- Pervert!
I am not.
I' m just popular.
Like Gilly here.
He doesn' t have a girlfriend, but I' il bet he' s having sex.
- Well, occasionally, sure, but...
Well, ultimately I believe in waiting till one is married before...
How come you don' t have a girlfriend?
Dad says you' re confused about your sexuality.
- No, I never said that.
- Right.
Fagnostic.
- Larry!
- That' s it!
Why?
She' s just repeating what you said.
You always take her side!
You let her get her ears pierced.
- You try to stop her!
- I got my ears pierced because I like it, OK?
And I got these pierced because I hate you!
Hey, that was you on the lnternet!
I am sick of bein 'treated like dirty bath water.
I chase poodles all day so she can drive around in a brand- new Saturn.
Fully loaded!
The usual, hon.
This kinda thing makes a man wanna bludgeon his family and get drunk.
That' s pretty serious talk, Larry.
Maybe you should speak to a professional about this.
You mean a hit man?
No, man.
- Unless you did it.
- I was talkin 'about a shrink, Larry.
Get real, man.
That' s for crazy people.
- Hey, maggots.
- Hey, Stewart.
What the hell happened to your hair?
You like it?
I just got it cut..... by the most beautiful woman on the face of God' s green earth.
- Looks pretty weird.
- Yeah, thanks.
She called it a European cut.
Says it draws attention away from my ears.
A fuckin 'chisel?
Who the hell cares?
I tell you, she' s well worth the price of a hat.
She' s new, over at Mega Kutz.
I can' t trust the opinion of a guy who scrapes up road kill for a living.
You can trust me with this one.
Man, she got the face of an angel.
Just gives you goose bumps all over, you know?
Like it?
Who' s next?
- Uh, right here.
- Come here.
So how do you like it?
Just like it is, only not quite so long.
So you want it shorter, then?
I think shorter' s the way to go.
So you cut a lot of hair?
I guess so.
I mean, I' ve been working here a month or so, ever since I moved back.
Oh, so you' re not from...
Uh, where are you from?
Oh, I' m from here.
Beaver, Oregon.
But then I moved back because I had to help out with my daddy.
He had stroke number two and he' s paralysed now, so...
It truly is.
Well, it' s his own damn fault.
He' s so tense all the time.
It' s like he' s got fire ants runnin 'through his veins.
Oh, I' m sorry!
How' s that, um...?
I' m sorry.
What did you say your name was?
Actually, I didn' t.
It' s Gilly.
OK, Gilly.
I' m Jo.
Could you hold that there for me?
- How' s that for length?
- Beautiful.
So I see you have a cat.
Well, I had a cat.
He ran away two weeks ago and I haven' t heard from him since.
Oh, he' il be back.
You know cats.
I' ve had him since he was a pup.
Ringo?
That must be a pretty popular name for a cat these days.
It is?
I work down at the animal shelter and I just took in a cat yesterday named Ringo.
Too bad this Ringo' s missin 'a tail.
- Aargh!
- Hey, watch the corner!
She said put him in ER 4.
Gilly!
Are you OK?
Were they able to sew it back on?
No, but they tell me I' m first in line for an ear donor.
You lying sack!
What are you doin 'tonight?
Just healin ', mostly.
I' il cook you dinner and you can bring Ringo.
Listen, Jo.
-.. and you cut off my ear.
- I do owe you dinner.
Just say yes, or else I just might cut off your other ear.
- OK.
- Yeah, 6. 30' s great.
I' m a much better cook than I am a hairstylist.
- I just don' t know why you' re doing this.
Cookin 'dinner for this fella.
You oughta be fixin 'dinner for Jack.
The man who wants to marry you, not some dog- catcher who makes 18 grand a year..... and comes home smellin 'like cat piss every night.
- Promise me you' il be polite.
Of course I' il be polite.
Jack called again today.
I talked to him for a long time.
He asked me why you left him.
I wish you would tell him, because I can' t make any sense out of it.
Are you listening to me?
- Hold on.
- Oh, would you... just put the thing down!
You listen to me now.
Good men are few and far between in this world.
When you find yourself a keeper - the way I found your sweet pop out there -.. then you grab ahold of him and you treat him the way he wants to be treated.
- (voice synthesizer) Valdine!
Valdine.
Valdine!
- What is it, gimpy?
- I want a beer, goddammit.
You hear me?
What in the name of God...?
- I was watchin 'that.
- Yeah, I bet you were.
Do you want another one?
- I want you to stay calm.
- Get me a goddamn beer.
Gilly!
Ringo!
All the dogs at the animal shelter chipped in for a little going- away present.
Well, thank them for me, and thank you.
- Just doin 'my job.
- How' s your ear?
It' s OK.
I got all the pus drained out of it.
(Jo' s father) Close the goddamn door.
You have a robot?
Daddy, I' d like you to meet Gilly Noble.
It' s a pleasure to meet you, Mr Wingfield.
He' s a little shy around strangers.
- I' m gonna get Ringo some half- and- half.
So...
Oh, golf, huh?
It seems every time I play, I get Tourette' s syndrome.
You know...
Shit, damn, crap.
Fore!
Shit, damn, crap.
Hey, dork.
Turn it to Channel 7, dipshit.
You can say "dipshit" with that thing.
That' s neat.
Come on, have some more.
You probably don' t eat this well very often on your salary.
- Mama, leave him alone.
- Aw, that' s OK, Jo.
I' il find room.
So, Willy, what do they pay you down there for gassin 'strays?
No, ma' am, I don' t gas them.
Hit 'em with a bat?
No, I meant I' m not the one who actually puts them to sleep.
I couldn' t do that.
And as for the pay, it' s not much, but it plays into my long- term career goal.
- Which is?
- I wanna be a veterinarian.
You' d be a great vet.
Doctor Noble.
Thanks, but it' s not gonna be easy.
Four more years at the junior college and I' il have my two- year degree.
And then I' il transfer over to State, and with a BA in general studies..... I should be able to get into any vet school in Mexico.
Sounds foolproof (!)
If Gilly says he' s gonna be a vet, then I believe he' s gonna be a vet.
Excuse me a minute.
Care for a taste of my pie?
I' m full.
Suit yourself.
I' m gonna have a slice.
Easy on the corns, Dr Dolittle.
The Lord,..... our Lord,..... has blessed me with the divine gifts of tracking, finding and retrieving.
Come on, Vic.
Just tell me what you have so far.
I' il tell you what I got.
But I believe that your birth mother is still alive and living somewhere in the local area.
And her name is..... Suki Yamaguchi.
That sounds a little, um,..... Japanese- y to me.
But so far, no luck.
What if you find out you' re the son of the guy who invented shoe polish?
I wouldn' t care if he just shined shoes for a living.
Not havin 'a family' s left a big, empty space inside of me.
- It' s really important that I find them.
- You will.
This is the first time I' ve ever been up here with anyone.
- You don' t like it up here, do you?
It' s fine.
Just being here reminds me of a bad time.
I was seven and we had to put our dog Humpy to sleep.
I still haven' t gotten over it.
- It' s ridiculous, I know.
- No, that' s not ridiculous at all.
Every Friday I see animals being put to sleep here..... and I wish that I could take 'em all home with me, but I can' t.
And every time one of those animals dies, I feel like a part of me dies too.
About a year ago, I wrote this poem that I recite to all the dogs before they go.
I like to think it helps them too.
I' d love to hear it.
No, it' s not very good.
I don' t care.
O noble creature
The time has come
For the two of us to part
And for you to go to a better place
A place deep inside my heart
A place where you' il be free to run
After a car or a bouncing ball
So go, noble creature
Through that doggy door
And fetch a stick that' s thrown by God
And wag thy tail for ever more
While a friendly voice repeats
"Good dog, good dog."
So that' s it.
And after I read it,..... I usually fire off a one- gun salute with a pistol we keep here at the shelter.
I know it sounds silly, but...
It doesn' t sound silly.
(Jo' s father) Help.
Very funny.
This is a great day.
It was a good idea.
- Shall we have the champagne?
Let' s wait till later.
You know, the day I cut your ear off,..... I never dreamed we' d be spending six months together.
Yeah, that is pretty funny.
I' ve had such a good time with you, just hanging out, having fun.
No strings attached.
Most guys are so possessive.
You know, they talk about marriage before the first year is even up.
There was this one schmuck, he actually went out and he got a plane and a banner.
It was so lame!
Talk about pressure.
- I' d love to, Gilly.
- Love to what?
I' d love to marry you.
That' s my Uncle Joe' s plane up there.
Joseph Wingfield... is your uncle.
I' m named after him.
You know, it probably should have occurred to me.
Boy, you don' t quit, do ya?
That' s the spot.
Oh, don' t go back there!
We gotta save some for the honeymoon.
What are you sayin ', Gilly?
Nothin '.
I was just... messin 'around with Ringo.
Hey, Jo.
Who' s Jack?
- What Jack?
- You know.
On- your- ass Jack.
Well, he' s my ex- boyfriend from Oregon.
I' ve been meaning to get it removed.
You' re notjealous, are you?
You' re the one with the half- naked Suzanne Somers over his bed.
Now don' t bad- mouth Suzanne.
She got me through my awkward teenage years.
- Do you mean you beat off to her?
- Not to brag, but... up to five times a day.
Do you wanna try to break that record?
Hey, it' s Gilly.
Leave a message.
Hey, Noble.
It' s Vic.
I know it' s early, but are you there, buddy?
- I love you, Jo.
I found your mother.
I' m 110 per cent sure.
Your mother' s name is Valdine Wingfield.
You gotta understand.
I had just had little Jo and we were strapped for cash..... and then I found out I was pregnant again... with you!
Old R2- D2 couldn' t keep it in his pants back then..... and now he can' t even wipe his own ass!
I just didn' t know how I was gonna feed everybody and you were such a hungry child!
You know, to somebody who wouldn' t resent you for your burden.
I mean, one of you had to go and Jo was already house- broke.
This can' t be happening.
I know how difficult this must be for you.
But think how lucky you are that you found out before it was too late,..... before you got married and consummated this forbidden relationship.
Sweet Lord!
You ponied your sister.
Oh, my God.
Hey, maggot.
- Nothin '.
- What you got there?
Well, I' d say Cougar.
What do you think, Wingfield?
It' s a coyote, Stewart.
There are no cougars in Indiana.
Hell, I' m talkin 'about the car.
Looks like Cougar tread.
- I used to work in a tyre store, you know.
- Well, I used to work at the animal shelter.
- Hey, Gilly, you know I had no choice.
Know how it feels when newspapers call you the boss of a sister- fucker?
Whole damn town thinks I' m runnin 'a sister- fuckeria.
Coulda stuck by me, Larry.
It was gonna blow over.
Who are you shittin '?
Not that I blame you.
I mean, if I had a sister that looked like that... whoa!
Wham- bam- thank- you- sis!
You' re right about that.
You know, I' d say, sister or no, I' d still like to get a crack at her.
That is, if she ever comes back.
- Is she still up in Oregon?
- As far as I know.
Chop chop!
(Jo) Dearest Gilly, I' m sorry I left without saying goodbye.
I just couldn' t face you after all that' s happened.
The feelings that once seemed so right became in an instant so wrong.
Though it pains me to say it, we must never see each other again.
And though we must never forget the love we shared,..... we must, like noble creatures, move on to another plane.
Valdine?
- Valdine!
I' m busy.
Put lots of salt on that sandwich.
- You want a lot of salt?
- Yes.
- Here you are, honey.
Nice and salty.
Hey, Gilly.
How was your day at work?
It was pretty slow.
Just snakes, mostly.
Well, dinner' s almost ready.
I made that nice chicken thing you like.
- Hey, Dad.
- I thought you were gonna get a haircut.
Now, Walter, hush.
- Gilly' s been through a lot.
- Includin 'his own sister.
I' d better get it.
Hello?
Hi, honey.
How are you?
How' s Jack?
Good, good.
Oh, he' s fine.
He' s been through a lot, but he' s hanging in there.
I know you miss him.
But guess what.
He' s regained the use of both of his arms now.
You know, they move every which way.
OK, well, what is it?
You' re getting married?
Oh, Jo- Jo, that is so wonderful!
It' s Jo- Jo.
Oh, my God.
Isn' t that wonderful?
Sweetheart, I am really, really happy for you.
OK, sure.
I' il talk to you tomorrow.
Bye- bye.
Yes!
Sweet Jesus!
The Wingfields have arrived!
- Pervert!
- Gilly, how' s your sister?
- I know.
- I think you should be happy for your sister.
After what you put her through,..... it' s a wonder she didn' t quit the sausage and become a vagina- tarian.
Oh, good God.
Things are really looking up for her.
She' s got a little beauty parlour up there and a guy who' s crazy about her..... and, quite frankly, a millionaire several times over.
Quit babying the boy, Valdine.
He banged his own sister, for Christ' s sakes.
What do you want?
Listen to me.
This could be a whole new start for us all, so I want you to keep your chin up.
Do you know what the Bible says about fuckin 'your own sister?
- Hush up, droopy.
He' s my baby, my precious gift from God.
- (door bell) - I' il get it.
I baked you some ginger snaps.
They' re cooling on the stove.
- What do you want?
- Sorry to bother you, Mrs Wingfield.
- My name is Leon Pitofsky.
- Oh, my God.
- No.
It' s just... you look remarkably like my dear husband when he was a much younger man.
Well, that stands to reason, ma' am.
(Valdine) Look at this.
It' s all there.
Look.
Here' s your signature, givin 'up your rights to me.
Oh, my Lord.
Then it' s true.
You are my son.
I' ve finally found you, Mama!
Well, if he' s your son, then who the hell' s this sack of shit?
I' il tell you who he is.
He' s a grifter.
He' s a shyster that' s been freeloading in this house for a solid year!
- I knew it!
Hippie?
Whoa, hold on.
Walter, get that impostor outta here.
- Dad, relax.
- Hey, buddy, you heard my mama.
Now get the hell out.
Get your hands off my daddy, you bastard!
- Walter!
He' s havin 'another stroke.
- Dad, what' s the problem?
My God!
You can get the...
Get the police!
I' il have this grifter arrested!
- (Leon) Police.
- Get an ambulance!
What does it mean now?
Oh, my God.
Oh, shit.
Mr Magoo!
You knocked my freakin 'legs off, daddy.
Were you even lookin 'at the road?
I' m sorry.
I' ve never hit anyone before.
Hope I was gentle.
Now, be a friend and fetch my getaway sticks, daddy.
- Your what?
- My legs, captain, my legs!
Oh, shit.
Less faeces, more fetchin '.
Get over here and get it, boy.
I gotta straighten this damn thing.
It' s bent all to hell.
- Watch out, watch out.
- Watch out?!
Boy, that is a hell of a thing for you to say to me.
Well, in all fairness, you were in the middle of the road.
How else was I supposed to flag you down?
I was a desperate man.
Another 20 minutes and them bloodthirsty mosquitoes woulda sucked me dry.
- How long have you been out here?
- Oh, about two hours.
My airplane ran outta gas.
I had to land in a clearing.
- You' re a pilot?
- You' re goddamn right I' m a pilot.
My card, right there.
- "The Big Dig"?
- That' s right.
Dig McCaffrey.
I make a lotta coin flyin 'those gigs nobody else wants.
Take sportsmen out to the bush, fly banners over supermarket openings, crop- dustin '.
I' il fly up your ass if the money' s right.
Hey, that' s pretty good.
Do you think I oughta put that on my card?
- So where am I takin 'you?
- As close to Beaver as you can get.
And a man as sexy and fertile as me likes to stay close to the beaver.
- That' s a good one!
- That' s right where I' m headed.
Say, you look like you' re draggin 'there, chief.
Why don' t you let me drive?
- Oh, no, that' s fine.
- I' m wired.
Nothin 'like gettin' bounced off a bumper to put a cat on full tilt.
So, where' s your launch pad, Kerouac?
- My what?
Where you from?
- I' m from Indiana.
- You remind me of a fella I knew..... down in El Paso durin 'my import- export days.
Never been there.
So, who' s the skirt?
- How did you know that I was...?
- Dig knows many things, baby.
Plus you got that look of a man with a diamond engagement ring on his pinkie.
About a year ago, she was the love of my life.
Then I found out she was my sister.
Then, about three days ago...
Dig!
Just a little case of the white- line fever, that' s all, baby!
Dig just needs a little music.
Rock and roll, baby!
I' d like to see somebody fall asleep to this shit here...
Ted Nugent!
Hey, Dig!
Are you crazy?
I' m wired like a microwave, baby!
Well, before we depart,..... I want you to know two things, El Paso.
I am one- eighth Chippewa Indian.
And when you save the life of a Chippewa, it must be paid back tenfold.
- I owe you big time.
- That' s not necessary, but thank you.
Heap big, daddy.
I appreciate everything you done for me.
- What was the other thing?
You said you wanted me to know two things.
I was sayin '...
Oh, yeah.
When you find that sister of yours, you get outta this town, ASAP.
- Some spooky cats around here.
- What kinda spooky cats?
The kind with money and power.
That sounds like the kinda guy Jo is with.
Well, good luck flippin 'that coin, daddy.
I' il see you later, El Paso.
Thanks for not suing me.
A pleasure bein 'hit by a man of your calibre.
- Yes.
I' m calling from Shelbyville, Indiana.
I' d like to report a sexual predator.
His name is Gilbert Noble.
He' s still very dangerous and he' s on his way to Beaver this very minute.
His own sister, huh?
You know, I didn' t know Jo Wingfield had a brother.
- Do you have a description of the pervert?
I have his mug shot, taken last year when he was arrested protesting for animal rights.
Sounds like a bad apple.
Why don' t you fax that over?
Listen.
I' d rather this didn' t get back to Jo.
She and Jack have so much on their minds, what with the big wedding.
I' d appreciate you being discreet about this.
Absolutely, ma' am.
Beaver Police are known for their discretion.
- Yeah.
- How you doin '?
- Fine.
Would you like the standard bikini wax?
I' m goin 'to Hawaii with my husband.
Better landscape the whole yard.
So... do you ever miss cutting hair, Jo?
No, not really.
I mean, my heart wasn' t into it, like it is with bikini waxing.
I was just born to yank.
Gilly?
Mama, how could you not have told me he was coming?
I' m sorry, baby.
I know I should have.
I just kept praying he' d come to his senses and get over it.
Poor, crazy guy.
Crazy?
What do you mean, crazy?
I hate to tell you this.
Leon.
He' s been going all over town and telling everybody he' s not your brother,..... but this fellow Leon is.
- Poor Gilly.
- Don' t you worry about him.
Your mama has enough love and compassion for that wounded bird.
I guess I should worry about how to break this to Jack.
You can' t tell Jack.
It would break the poor man' s heart.
Rich.
Hey, Rich, wake up.
Hi, Jack.
I want you to go on over to the hotel.
Tell Chaney I sent you.
He' il put it on my account.
- I don' t wanna take your money.
- I' il tell you somethin '.
I got my business and most of my money from my father.
- The least I can do is to give something back.
- I just need another ten minutes.
- No, come on.
You do as I say, all right?
Come see me in the morning and we' il talk about gettin 'you ajob.
- Thanks, Jack.
- Hey, gimme that.
Keep marching.
I' il have my brother Jimmy come back and check on you later, all right?
I' m great, I' m great.
Look, I was wondering if maybe me and you could go to the diner, grab some coffee.
- You know, like old times.
- Oh, Gina, I' d love to.
I' d hate to embarrass my bride- to- be.
Yeah, well, actually your bride- to- be was gonna be the topic of conversation.
I had this picture on my cell wall.
It was my hope for the future.
This was my reason for gettin 'out.
You had a picture of a car on your wall?
Damn, Jimmy!
Did you beat off to it?
Hell, no!
I spanked it to that baby right there.
This is the only car in the world that makes me flex my love muscle.
- Jimmy loves you.
- Jimmy, get off the car.
I was just givin 'it a full body dust.
- Just try not to spooge on it.
- Spooge on it!
Shut up.
Listen, Jimmy.
I got a security problem I want you to deal with.
His name' s Gilbert.
Jo' s brother.
I didn' t know Jo had a brother.
Some families have brothers they don' t like to talk about.
Just make sure he disappears, all right?
- Done and done.
- Jimmy,..... feel free to rough him up a little bit.
Excuse me, sir.
A friend of mine has a salon here in town.
Her name is Jo Wingfield.
- I don' t suppose...
She works at Beaver Cuts.
You just take a left on Main, you go down about three blocks on the right.
In fact, I just went by there on my lunch break and I saw Jo in the window.
Great.
Yeah.
Say hi to Jo for me.
- I will, for sure.
Hey, buddy.
You know where a fella gets a beer around here?
I was...
Damn right you ain' t from around here!
Come on, Freddy, let' s go!
Hey, Jack.
- Somethin 'you wanna tell me, Jo?
- Is something bothering you?
I know about..... about you and... your brother.
Oh, God.
Dammit!
- I' m sorry.
- Sorry?
I' m the one who should be sorry, Jo.
You poor thing.
It' s not your fault.
You had no way of knowing he was your brother.
It' s like a Greek tragedy.
I think about it, it breaks my heart.
And how devastating it must have been for you.
For both of you.
God, that poor guy!
- I' m sorry, Jo.
- Oh, Jack!
Mister!
Can I have your peanuts, por favor?
- Sure.
- Gracias.
(captain) Please put your seats to the upright position..... in preparation for our arrival in Puerto Vallarta.
("Louie Louie" by The Kingsmen)
You don' t get it?
What, did your adoptive mother drop you on your head?
No one can see you till after the wedding.
Until then, yourjob is to find Gilly Noble and keep him out of the way.
Bye, Dad.
- Valdine, slow down.
- Shut up, Walter!
- (Valdine) Christ!
- Have fun!
Jack?
- Look at my hard worker.
- Honey, why are you home?
I closed the shop early so I could get some of the wedding chores done.
Great.
Take that cute little dress off and come on in.
No, I gotta get some things done.
Tell you what.
While you' re out there, pick your mom up somethin 'nice for her arrival.
That' s sweet, Jack.
Now scoot before I pull you in here with me.
- Take your time, why don' t you!
Come here.
My future son- in- law!
- Look at you.
It' s been a long time.
I' m so excited about the wedding.
Watch it, jerk- off!
I' m gonna get both of ya.
Sorry, Walter!
Oh, man, that musta hurt!
You all right?
I' m gonna kick your ass.
What' s that, Walter?
You say you wanna lick my ass?
Everything' s cool, Jack.
We got it under control.
You could be movin '.
Right up the stairs.
Gracias.
- What' s up, buckaroo?
- I have an appointment with Jo Wingfield.
OK.
Do you think that you could give her a note for me?
Uh...
Can I borrow a pen?
- Thanks.
- You' re welcome.
You!
Pre- vert!
Wait a minute.
No, I...
9- 11!
I' m calling!
Oh, man.
(police radio) All units, subject last seen behind Beaver Cuts.
- You diggin 'my system now, ain' t ya?
- Hey, Dig.
Stand down, Frito Bandito.
Can' t you see I' m playin 'keno?
- Dig, it' s me, Gilly.
- I don' t know no goddamn Gilly.
El Paso.
El Paso!
Sit on down.
You look like you' re all grown up, boy.
This is a disguise, Dig.
Apparently there are people in this town that don' t like me.
I gotta find my truck.
Ooh, truck.
- Yeah, trouble.
- What' s the problem?
He had a charity event last night.
Shit, a good time.
- People paid to beat the hell outta my truck?
- Set me back ten bucks.
I think I threw out my shoulder with your quarter panels.
Whacked it once, and again, then it broke.
That son of a bitch!
I cannot believe Jo is gonna marry that Mitchelson creep!
- She' s marryin 'Jack Mitchelson?
- Yes, in two days, Dig.
I gotta find a way to stop it and I need your help.
Slow down, Speedy Gonzales!
You can count Dig outta any plans to jack up the jig for Jack.
Am I right?
- Yeah, he' s the best.
Folks like him round here.
Why don' t you just leave well enough alone, OK?
Let her marry Jack.
Bein 'with him is like winnin' the husband Super Lotto.
Listen.
If you really love this girl as much as you say you do,..... just tell her goodbye and good luck.
But I don' t know if I can live without her.
- Hello?
- Jo!
How' s it goin 'at...
- What?
- He was here, at the shop!
- When?
Oh, my God.
Ugh!
- Morning, Mama.
Morning, Daddy.
- Morning, Jo.
- Where are you headed off to?
- I just got somethin 'I have to do.
I' il go with you.
- No, it' s something I have to do on my own.
- I could go with you, keep you company.
It' il be boring.
- Not to me, sweetheart.
See you later.
(Walter) Help!
- Bees!
Oh, my God!
Stay absolutely still.
I gotta go get my camera.
God, this is too great for words!
I' ve been walkin 'for ever.
- Jo!
- Gilly, I' ve been lookin 'all over for you.
Mama told me how you' ve been tellin 'everyone about your imaginary friend, Leon.
- That' s what she said?
- You gotta accept the truth.
We can' t be together, ever.
I' m glad that you said that because, um...
If you really love this girl as much as you say you do,..... just tell her goodbye and good luck.
You' re right.
Then what are you doin 'here in Beaver?
I just wanted to...
I just wanted to say goodbye..... and... good luck.
I really do.
And I promise, after today I' il never bother you again.
Don' t make it sound so sad, Gilly.
We' il still see each other at..... family funerals and stuff.
Goodbye, Jo.
I love you.
I love you too.
What the...?
- Settle down, El Paso.
Here you go, Benjy.
Now remember, you promised not to smoke those till you' re 12.
Right on.
- You wanna tell me what' s goin 'on?
He is one evil dude.
Who is?
- Mitchelson!
- Jack?
He' s the snarliest cat this town has ever seen, baby.
- But you said he...
- That was just show business.
You gotta toe the line for John Q Public.
This town' s got elephant ears, baby.
You can' t trust anybody any more.
Come on, El Paso.
Slide over to my place.
El Paso, you got your work cut out for you, baby.
Jack Mitchelson got millions from his daddy.
And, in my experience, women like dead presidents more than broke boyfriends.
No romance without finance, daddy.
Hey, Jo' s not like that.
Shit.
Love may be blind, but it can still smell that money, baby.
Not to mention... there' s a lotta cash in sellin 'grass.
- What does that mean?
- Hey, Sherlock.
Jack Mitchelson is the biggest marijuana grower in the Pacific Northwest.
You are not seein 'the forest for the weed here, man.
This dude' s a pot grower, a reefer salesman, a doobie doctor.
That' s why Jack keeps Beaver squeaky- clean: to keep Johnny Law from sniffin 'around.
- How does he get away with it?
- Half the town' s on the payroll.
The rest... scared to death of that wombat.
Man!
We' ve gotta figure out a way to get Jo outta there.
Amen to that.
What we need, my friend, is a plan.
I' m gonna sit on down here and study on that for a minute.
That' s a nice doggy.
- Hell of a watchdog.
Nothin 'gets by him.
Hello, ladies.
Do you wanna dance?
- Be gentle with him, boys.
Wait a minute.
Look, if you' re tryin 'to scare me, you' ve done a terrific job, OK?
Fellas, this is uncalled- for!
Come on!
Look, this is unfair.
All' s I want is ten minutes with Jo.
Hey, who doesn' t?
Come on, Jimmy.
Let' s get down to business.
That' s what you get, you dirty little pervert!
Right on the head!
- What?
Maybe you oughta be wearin 'your glasses.
Yeah, but they make me look stupid.
Go get him, Freddy!
Keep away from me!
You can' t stop me from seein 'Jo.
I' m gonna marry her, you' il see!
You' re sick, man!
- He wants to marry his sister.
- He' d better not come back!
Yeah, that' s right, or we' il tie you to a tree, fuck you in the ass while we jerk you off!
Show you what we really do to perverts around here!
- You sicko!
- Keep runnin ', boy!
Hey, Dig!
- El Paso!
Up here!
- Dig, what are you doin 'up there?
- What do you mean, what am I doin 'up here?
You ever try jumpin 'off a roof with no legs?
It stings!
- What do you wanna do about this?
- Don' t worry.
I got a leg for all seasons.
I' m not..... your brother. "
"Marry me."
Dig, this is great.
Thank you so much.
Finally I' m gonna be able to set the record straight.
- You sure there are two r' s in "marry"?
- Yeah, there' s definitely two r' s.
Good enough.
Are you sure you can fly with that thing?
I' m Dig McCaffrey, boy!
I could fly a can of Spam like this!
- How' d you lose those legs, anyway?
- Plane crash.
Come on, let' s light this firecracker.
- All right.
Let' s go, Dig.
They can hug all the trees they want.
It' s the government I worry about.
Barkeep!
Less talk and more vodka.
Yes, ma' am.
Gina?
- Get you a drink while I' m at it?
- Yeah, I' il have a nice, stiff one.
(Valdine) Jack, Jack, Jack.
How do you stay so fit?
El Paso, I got somethin 'here that' s gonna get their attention.
That' s my man Wagner!
That' s good, huh?
We' il come in low out of the afternoon sun.
- Check it out, El Paso.
- Hi, Jo!
Check out my banner!
I' ve missed you!
- I' m the one, Jo!
- Oh, my God.
It says it all!
That Jack' s no good for you, Jo!
I' m the one!
I love you!
He really is crazy.
I knew that boy was trouble the minute I laid eyes on him.
Bill, we' ve got a code nine in progress.
Mobilise all units.
- We done pretty good, huh, Gilly?
- Oh, yeah, Dig.
Holy shit!
It' s Beaver Five- O!
- What' s goin 'on, Dig?
- What' s goin 'on?
Start eatin '!
Gilbert Noble, please step out of the airplane with your hands behind your head.
Well, ship my ass to big red China!
They want the white boy.
I didn' t do anything.
I don' t know.
See you, stranger.
All right, get your hands up!
- What' s goin 'on here?
- OK, boys, grab him!
Hey, take it easy!
What' s goin 'on?
- This isn' t fair!
- Neither is stalkin 'your sister, son.
Straight to the nuthouse.
Jack Mitchelson has offered to pay for his therapy.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Today we' re discussing why it is wrong to have sex with someone related to you.
My wife was related to me.
I had sex with her.
That' s not the same thing, Mr Murphy.
Once a week we' d have sex, until she died.
Then it was three or four times a week.
We' re quite familiar with your case, Mr Murphy.
- Can we have pancakes tomorrow?
- We had pancakes yesterday, Mr Campisi.
Today I would like to talk about how Mr Noble can overcome..... his unnatural compulsions toward his sister.
He could kill her.
Mr Chin...
Can we have pancakes tomorrow?
I know you.
From before.
You hit me with a lead pipe.
I didn' t hit you.
- Uh, yeah.
- I don' t want any trouble now, OK?
You got any naked pictures of your sister?
Of course not.
Wanna buy some?
Ten bucks apiece.
- Where' d you get these?
- Jimmy brung them to me.
You know, to keep me company.
Not bad, huh?
He also brung me these 'ums.
Jo' s panties.
Used, too.
- Gimme those!
- Ten bucks apiece.
No way!
These don' t belong to you!
That' s my future wife!
You owe me a lotta money for them nakeds.
All right, here' s ten dollars.
That' s all I have.
Pancakes!
Pancakes!
We can try again another day (Dig) Gilly!
- (muffled cries)
Don' t worry, buddy.
The cavalry' s here.
Come on.
It' s time for you to make your break.
There we go.
Dig, what are you doin 'here?
I told ya, a Cherokee always repays his debt.
- I thought you were one- eighth Chippewa.
- Right, and one- eighth Cherokee.
Dig' s a complex cat, baby.
Hey, are you the pancake guy?
- What' s he doin 'here?
- I went to the wrong room.
Come on, let' s get you outta here.
How does it feel to be off the rock, baby?
You are out!
You are free!
Feels great, Dig!
Thanks a lot!
I woulda sprung ya sooner,..... but after I ate all that weed, it took me two days just to pass the stems!
Leon?
Holy shit!
Dig, follow that car!
There he is.
Pull over!
The Eager Beaver.
They used to shoot porno pictures there.
Did a screen test once.
Never heard anything.
That is Leon.
That' s Jo' s real brother.
He' s my proof.
Now all' s I gotta do is get her down here and show her.
Well, hell' s bells.
You better scoot.
Accordin 'to the paper, that wedding' s in less than three hours.
- Here, take my pony.
I couldn' t do that.
Take it.
Possessions mean nothin 'to the Navajo.
You go and get your woman.
I' il make sure whiffle balls stays where he is.
And you get your ass off there, Campisi.
Today, son!
OK, Dig, thanks a lot.
Good journey.
All right, Campisi.
We got an assignment.
God, what the hell is this?
All right.
Move along.
Let' s go!
Get outta the way!
All right, now that' s it!
I' m tired of bein 'nice.
Now get off the road!
Get your smelly ass off the road!
I said get your butt...
Come on!
OK, come on, just relax.
Hold on.
- Just where you think you goin ', Leon?
- Who the hell are you?
I' m your warden till my friend Gilly gets back.
- Gilly?
I said it.
Don' t you...
I' m warnin 'ya.
Son of a bitch!
Get away from...
Goddammit!
Thief!
Looky there!
Cowpuncher!
Hey, you' re turnin 'the herd on!
What happened?
Your sister turn you down?
That cow forgot to wipe its ass!
Giddy- up!
Why don' t you buy her dinner first?
That' s pretty funny (!)
Why don' t you get on with your life?
- It' s a puppet show!
- Grab her tits!
(Jo) Gilly, what are you doing?
Nothin '.
What are you doin '?
- I thought you were gettin 'married.
- I am, in an hour.
Zahf was just doing my make- up.
You' re supposed to be at the hospital, getting better.
Jo, listen.
I got great news.
I found Leon.
I found Leon, and I got him dead to rights.
That' s great, Gilly.
Why don' t you pull your arm out of Leon' s butt..... and we' il take a drive to the hospital?
No, Jo, this isn' t Leon.
This is just some cow that..... I got my hand... stuck in.
Jo, Leon' s at the Eager Beaver.
If you come with me, I will prove it to you.
Gilly, stop it, please!
You have issues.
- Gilly...
- Of course.
And that' s why Jack and I have decided to have a family of our own.
But, Jo, listen.
- Gilly, leave me to have my family.
Are those my missing underwear?
Jo, I can explain these.
I didn' t steal them.
I bought 'em off the same scumbag who sold me naked pictures of you.
In my country, for violating a sacred beast, you get beaten to death with bamboo sticks!
Pre- vert!
Oh, my God.
The ring!
That was one evil trip.
Well, this is it, Daddy.
The day every girl dreams about.
You' il like living up here.
You' il have the best medical care and Mama won' t have to work so hard.
Is this what you want?
What do you mean?
I mean..... are you happy?
Why wouldn' t I be happy?
I mean, this is a great thing, for all of us.
Show time, Mr Wingfield.
- Hey, pervert.
- Hey, Streak.
- What are you doin '?
- Ain' t no mental home that' il hold Streak.
That' s my truck.
- Get your hands up!
Was your truck.
It looks really nice.
She' s my home now.
So technically you' re standin 'on my front lawn.
Back your ass up off my property and into them woods.
OK, Streak.
Just take it easy.
You shouldn' t have cheated me on those panties.
Just relax.
Everything' s all right.
The pictures and the underwear and everything.
- I' il take that too.
- That' s my ring!
It' s my ring now, pretty boy.
Why don' t you turn around?
We' re gonna take a nature walk.
Streak, come on now.
I gave you everything you wanted.
And do you, Josephine Wingfield, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?
I do.
And do you, Jack Mitchelson, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?
I do.
If anyone amongst you can show just cause..... why these two should not be joined in holy matrimony,..... speak now or forever hold your peace.
- (Walter) Stop.
Sorry.
It' s the machine.
It malfunctions when the battery' s low.
Just go right ahead.
She' s... in love with...
Here we go.
Problem solved.
Just go on.
I now pronounce you... blah- blah- blah.
Very well.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Well, what do we got here?
Gilly Noble.
Look at you tasty beauty, you.
You ain' t gonna mess up my sister' s wedding, you pervert!
Here' s my wedding present, Mama!
- Is Daddy all right?
It' s just all the excitement.
He' d love to join you, but he' s not up to it.
One, two,..... three...
I' d like to propose a toast.
A toast to my baby girl, to little Jo,..... who has finally found the man of her dreams, a man that is not only the... (police siren)
Cops?
See ya!
What' s goin 'on?
Sorry to bother you, Jack.
Mrs Mitchelson, I' m afraid we have some... bad news.
There' s been an accident.
His truck... blew up.
Body was burned beyond recognition, ma' am.
By the time we got to the scene, coyotes had torn off some of the major body parts.
- They even ate his...
- Gina!
I think that' s enough description of the deceased for right now.
Are you sure that it was Gilly?
We found this ring on his finger bone, with your names inscribed on it.
I scooped up what I could.
Ashes, mostly.
Put 'em in my Thermos.
Thought you might like to keep 'em for a remembrance.
He killed himself.
I know it!
- It' s all my fault.
- No, that is not true, ma' am.
Your brother is in that Thermos on account of a fella I have in custody here.
Bring him out.
Leon?
- (Leon) Mama!
It was an accident!
I didn' t mean to bump his car, and then it exploded.
He' s your brother, Jo.
- Your real brother.
- We hid the truth from you..... because Valdine wanted a crack at Jack' s money..... and, Lord help me, so did I.
So are you sayin 'that Gilly was never my brother?
How could you do that to me?
He was a dog- catcher.
You' re just crazy, OK?
- No.
- I' m just very confused right now.
- No, don' t apologise to him.
- He set the whole thing up.
- That' s a lie!
Ask him if the name Vic Vetter rings a bell.
- Jack sent Vic false information about Gilly.
You tell her, Valdine.
You tell her the truth.
You' re sick!
You' re fucking sick!
I hope you all make one big happy family.
Just don' t include me.
Look at you!
- She deserves a better life.
- How dare you ruin my wedding?
- Blow me.
You did this!
I' m gonna kill you!
Son of a bitch!
I' m gonna kill you!
Mama!
- Mama?
Gina, better call them ambulance boys.
We need an ambulance ASAP.
It looks like a possible coronary, or some sort ofjiggling...
Holy shit!
- It' s the ghost of El Paso past!
- Hi, Dig.
"Hi, Dig" shit!
I thought you was barbecue!
- So everybody thinks I' m dead.
Campisi too.
I guess it' s probably all for the better.
Now Jo can really get on with her life here.
I' ve no idea how I' m gonna get home.
Dig McCaffrey, at your service.
"I' il fly up your ass if the money' s right."
I can' t believe you put it on.
That' s good, huh?
- Are you serious?
- It' s the least I can do..... after whalin 'on your truck with a sledgehammer.
Come on, El Paso.
The bird' s out front and all gassed up.
What you gonna do?
- Let' s light that firecracker.
- You bet your ass.
For the two of us to part
A place deep inside my heart
- Gilly, deep down, I always did believe you.
- I know that, Larry, and I do appreciate it.
If you don' t mind, I' il sneak you in the back door.
Hey, is that Jo?
Jo!
And fetch the stick that' s thrown by God
Gilly?
Oh, my God.
Jo, I thought you killed yourself.
I was just givin 'you the one- gun salute.
I can' t believe you' re alive!
Now, Valdine, don' t be so sad.
You' re gainin 'a son.
(voice synthesizer) Blow it out your ass, Walter.
First of all, congratulations on your nuptials.
- I wanna wish you much happiness.
- Thanks, Vic, but we got guests.
I know you got guests, but I got some good news.
I found your mother.
Your real mother this time.
Free of charge.
- I don' t know, Vic...
- Listen to me, Gilly.
She flew all the way from California to meet you.
My baby!
My precious gift from God!
Suzanne Somers is my mother?
Gilly, didn' t you used to...?
5, 6, 7, 8
Anybody seen the Kelly Sisters?
You, you' re up in 5.
- Keep the change, Charlie.
Where the hell have you been?
- And where is Veronica?
- She' s not herself tonight.
But they came to see your sister act.
Don' t sweat it.
Shit!
Come on!
Move it!
Ladies and gentlemen, the Onyx club is proud to present Chicago' s hottest dancing duo,
Two jazz babes moving as one.
The Kelly Sisters!
* And all that Jazz *
* And all that jazz *
* And all that Jazz *
Let' s go, babe.
But I didn' t even meet your friend.
That manager guy.
Don' t worry, Roxie.
It' s all taken care of.
You told him about me?
It' s all arranged.
* And all that jazz *
* And all that jazz *
* And all that jazz *
* If she' d hear her baby' s queer *
- Hello, Miss Borusewicz.
- Mrs. Hart.
This is Fred.
He' s my brother.
Say it again, Frank.
My little shooting star!
* And all *
Say it again, Fred.
Hey, where' s the fire?
Amos ain' t home till midnight.
Freddie?
Hey, you know,
I don' t want you to feel like I’ m nagging at you or anything, but don' t you think it' s about time that I met your friend down at the Onyx?
I mean, it' s been a month since you told him about me.
I know.
'Cause that was the night Velma Kelly, plugged her husband and her sister.
You know, they say that she found them in the kip together.
Amos soapin 'it to somebody else...
Boy, I' d throw him a party.
- A big, big going away party.
- It’ s getting late.
I have been thinking a lot about my act, though.
Whenever I get a good idea, I write it down in my diary before it goes out of my head.
And you know what occurred to me?
The other day... that... all the really really knock- out acts have something a little different going on, you know?
Like, a signature band.
And I thought my thing could be.. "aloof"... you know?
Give them just enough to get them good and hungry but always leave them wanting more.
Once I get a name for myself, maybe maybe we can open up a club of our own, you know?
- Oh, get off.
- What' s the idea?
Wake up, kiddo, you ain' t never gonna have an act.
Says who?
You' re a two- bit talent with skinny legs.
And I' m just a furniture salesman.
Yeah, but you got connections, you know.
That guy down at the club...
There' s no guy.
Yeah, that night...
It was the first time I set foot in that joint.
I was collecting on a bet from the trombone player.
So you never told anyone about me?
Sugar, you are hot stuff.
I would have said anything to get a piece of that.
So now what?...
Now?
We had some laughs.
Fred...
You can' t do this to me.
You get off!
You touch me again, I’ il put your lights out.
- Wait...
- Your husband will be home soon, why don' t you wash yourself before you go hitting those sheets again.
- You' re a liar, Fred.
- Oh, yeah, so what?
You lied to me...
That' s life.
You son of a bitch...
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!
Why are you bothering, Sal?
This one' s all wrapped up.
I hear it' s a new city record.
From killing to confession in an hour flat.
Why did you get the murder weapon?
I keep a gun in the underwear drawer.
Just in case of trouble, you know.
That' s just fine.
Sign right there, Mr. Hart.
Freely and gladly.
And mind you don' t say we beat it out of you when you get up on the witness stand.
Surrendered of my own free will.
- Isn' t he the cheerful murderer!
Just last week a jury thanked a man.
I’ m always grateful for citizens who know the law.
Get in there.
You too.
Sit down.
Okay, from the top.
A man has got a right to protect his home and his loved ones, right?
I come home from the garage, and I see him climbing through the window.
With my wife Roxie laying there, sleeping like an angel.
Is that true, Mrs. Hart?
My wife has nothing to do with it.
Not even a worm.
It wasn' t until I fired the first shot, then she even opened her eyes.
Boy she' s some heavy sleeper, I always said she could sleep through the St. Patty' s day parade.
When I think of what would have happened if I went out for a beer with the guys instead of coming straight home...
It makes me sick even to think about it...
For her first number, Miss Roxie Hart would like to sing a song of love and devotion.
Dedicated to her dear husband, Amos.
* But he doesn' t care *
* But he follows' round *
Like I said, even after I shot him, he kept coming at me.
So I had to pull the trigger again.
* And Lord knows * * he ain' t got the smarts *
* Is a whole lot greater *
I mean suppose if... just suppose that he had violated her or something.
You know what I mean, violated?
I know what you mean.
Think how terrible that would have been.
It’ s good thing I got home from work on time.
* That funny honey of mine * - I say I’ m telling you that.
Fred Casely.
Fred Casely?
How could he be a burglar?
He sold us our furniture.
He gave us 10% off.
* Lord knows he ain' t got the smarts *
- She told me he was the burglar!
- You mean he was dead when you got home?
I’ m covering the sheet and she' s telling me some cock' n' bull story about this burglar.
And how I ought to say I did it 'cause I was sure to get off.
* I can' t stand that sap *
* Look at him go! * - And I believed her,
* Ranting on me! * - That cheap little tramp.
* With just one more brain * - So she was two- timing me, huh?
* What a half- wit he' d be! * - Well I’ m through protecting her now...
* If they string me up * - I’ m on the garage with my butt 14 hours a day.
And tramping around like some goddamn floozy!
Thought she could pull the wool over my eyes, eh?
* That scummy... * - I wasn' t born yesterday. * crummy... dummy... * - I tell you that some things a man just can' t take.
I didn' t shoot him.
Boy what a sap I was!
You double- crosser!
You big blabber- mouth!
- You promised you' d stick...
- What' re you talking about?
You' ve been sticking me, Roxanne!
- You told me it' s a burglar!
- Goddamn it!
You are a disloyal husband!
Look, it' s true.
I shot him.
He was trying to burgle me.
From what I hear, he' s been burglin 'you three times a week for the last month.
So what do you say, Missus?
- That' s him, all right.
- Thank you.
Your story doesn' t wash, Mrs. Hart.
So try this on for size.
Fred Casely was a good time on the side, with Goofy here as a meal ticket.
He couldn' t buy my liquor.
And Fred Casely could?
With a wife and five little Caselys?
Or did he forget to mention them.
- What?
- All his.
That bastard!
That bastard!
And I would kill him again!
Once was enough, deary.
Take her downtown.
Here they come!
This way, honey.
It’ s a shame to hide such a beautiful face.
Why' d you shoot him?
Why don' t you give us a profile, with a little smile like the girl from the toothpaste ad?
Enjoy it while you can.
- Hanging?
- I’ m ready to go to the jury tomorrow.
- What do you mean hanging?
- Not so confident anymore, are you?
Take her down to the Cook County Jail.
What did you shoot him?
Was he cruel to you?
Did he beat you?
Was he foolin 'around?
Hey, what do you mean hanging?
Morphine, opium, cocaine?
Arm length:
31inches...
So don' t get too cozy.
Put off that cigarette!
Ever had Morton before?
She' s fine... as long as you keep her happy.
And now, ladies and gentlemen.
The keeper of the keys, the countess of the clink, the mistress of murderers' row...
Matron Mama Morton!
* They' il tell you I' m * * the biggest mother hen *
* The system called reciprocity... *
On your feet.
Welcome, ladies.
* When you' re good to Mama *
It' s just not true.
* You do one for Mama *
I’ d be your friend if you let me.
So if there' s something that upsets you or makes you unhappy in any way, don' t shoot your fat- ass mouth off on me 'cause I won' t give a shit.
* So, I deserve a lot of tat *
Let' s go!
You must be Hart.
Ain' t you the pretty one?
- Thank you, ma' am.
- Oh, no, call me Mama.
I' m gonna take care of you.
Now, you' d be happy taken down in the East block.
Murderers' Row, we call it.
Oh?
I don' t think I really belong in here.
I didn' t actually do anything wrong.
I never heard of a man getting killed, when he didn' t get just what was coming to him.
Hey, mama.
Come here.
Velma Kelly?
You' re the Velma Kelly?
I was there the night that you got arrested.
Yeah, you and half of Chicago.
Look at this, Mama.
An editorial denouncing me in Redbook magazine.
"Not in memory do we recall so fiendish and horrible a double homicide."
Baby you couldn' t buy that kind of publicity.
Couldn' t buy it?
Nice try.
* Spice it up for Mama *
* Folks contribute to *
* She' il put out for you *
* So boost me up my ladder, Kid *
* Like the Princeton crew *
* So what' s the one conclusion *
Mama?
It’ s... kinda... freezing in here.
You don' t think maybe there' s something wrong with the heat?
Not that I’ m complaining, but... you know...
If you' ve got a couple of extra blankets tucked away...
Lights out, ladies.
* Pop *
* Six *
* Squish *
* Uh uh *
* Cicero *
* Lipschitz! *
And now, the six merry murderesses of the Cook county jail in their rendition of
The Cell- block Tango.
* Pop *
* Six *
* Squish *
* Uh uh *
* Cicero *
* Lipschitz! *
* If you' d have been there *
You know how people have these little habits that get you down?
Like, Bernie.
Bernie liked to chew gum.
No, not chew.
And I’ m looking for a little bit of sympathy.
And there' s Bernie, lying on the couch, drinking a beer and chewing.
No, not chewing.
Popping!
So I said to him,
"You pop that gum one more time..."
And he did.
So I took the shotgun off the wall and
I fired two warning shots... into his head.
* If you' d have been there *
I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake City about two years ago.
And we hit it off right away.
So we started living together.
He' d go to work.
He' d come home.
I’ d fixed him a drink.
We did dinner.
And then I found out.
Single, he told me.
Single my ass!
Not only he was married, oh no.
He has 6 wives.
One of those Mormons, you know.
So that night when he came home from work,
I fixed him his drink, as usual.
You know some guys just can' t hold their arsenic.
* And then he used it *
Now I’ m standing in the kitchen.
Carving up a chicken for dinner minding my own business.
In storms my husband Wilbur in a jealous rage.
"You' ve been screwing the milkman?" he says.
He was crazy.
And he kept on screaming, "You' ve been screwing the milkman!"
And then he ran into my knife.
He ran into my knife 10 times.
* I betcha you would * * have done the same! *
Yeah, but did she do it?
Uh- uh!
Not guilty!
My sister Veronica and I had this double act.
And my husband Charlie traveled around with us.
Now for the last number in our act we did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row.
1 - 2 - 3 - 4 5 - Split - Spread eagles
One right after the other.
So this one night before the show, we were down at the Hotel Cicero.
The three of us boozin ', havin' a few laughs.
And we ran out of ice.
So I go out to get some.
I come back.
Open the door.
And there' s Veronica and Charlie, doing number 17: the spread eagle!
Well, I was in such a state of shock.
I completely blacked out.
I can' t remember a thing.
It wasn' t until later, when I was washing the blood off my hands, I even knew they were dead!
* I didn' t do it *
* They had it coming *
I loved Al Lipschitz more than I could possibly say.
He was a real artistic guy.
A painter.
But he was always trying to find himself.
He' d go out every night looking for himself and on the way... he found Ruth,
Rosemary, and Irving.
I guess you could say we broke up because of artistic differences.
* The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum *
* How could you tell us * * that we were wrong? *
- You pop that gum one more time...
- Single my ass!
Ten times
- Number 17, the spread eagle - Artistic differences
* Pop *
* Six *
* Squish *
* Uh uh *
* Cicero *
* Lipschitz! *
Who belongs to them?
- What' s it to you?
- Nothing.
Heard they were Velma' s.
Yeah, the Hunyak does all her laundry for a buck a week.
Fresh towels for the can.
Make it quick.... I’ m gonna take care of you now.
Now, Billy Flynn set your trial day for March 5th.
On March 8th, you know what Mama' s gonna do for you?
Mama' s gonna put you back on the Vaudeville circle.
So now you' re an agent too?
Well deary, until Ma Bell installs a private line in your cell all your calls are gonna go through me.
What kind of dough are we talking about?
You know, it' s a crazy world.
I mean, Babe Ruth is wearing rouge and playing a palace for $5, 000 a week.
And what about someone with real talent?
Well, I can talk to the boys over at William Morris.
And due to your recent sensational activities, they seem to think they can get you $2, 500. $2, 500?
Geez, the most me and Veronica made was $350.
Yeah, well, that' s what happens when you have the right presentation.
I always wanted to play Big Jim Colosimo' s.
Do you think you can get me that?
- Yeah.
Geez, I don' t know.
It' s gonna take another phone call.
And how much is that gonna cost?
You' re like family to me.
You' re like one of my own.
- I’ il do it for 50 bucks.
- 50 bucks for a phone call?
You must get a lot of wrong numbers, Mama.
That' s your personals.
Freshly pressed by yours truly.
No, no.
Hey, listen.
You know that Harrison guy?
He said that what I done is a hanging case and that he' s prepared to ask for the maximum penalty.
So?
I sure would appreciate some advice.
Especially from someone I admire as much as you.
You see, since I can remember, I have wanted to be on the stage.
What' s your talent?
Washing and drying?
I dance in the chorus.
- That was before I met my husband Amos.
- Look, honey, you want some advice?
Here it is, direct from me to you.
Keep your paws off my underwear, okay?
Yeah, okay.
Thanks... for nothin '.
She' s somethin ', ain' t she?
I tell you, no matter how big she gets, she' s still as common as ever.
I’ d like to help you, deary.
Take a load off.
So, what do you figure on using for grounds?
What are you gonna tell the jury?
I figure I’ d tell them the truth.
- The truth?
That' s a one way ticket to the death house.
Holy mother of God.
I mean, in this town, murder is a form of entertainment.
Besides, in 47 years Cook County ain' t never hung a woman yet.
- that they won' t hang you.
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
You' re talking to the wrong people.
What you need, is Billy Flynn.
- Who?
He' s only the best criminal lawyer in all of illinois.
What he don' t know about juries and women.
How do you get this Billy Flynn?
Well, not by prayin ', dearie.
Then I’ il make a phone call.
A hundred dollars?
Well you just...
I mean, it seems pretty steep for a phone call.
Oh, but he' s worth every cent.
He' s never lost a case for a female client yet.
And with a sweet little puss like yours, well...
- He' s never lost a case?
Every girl in this place would kill to have Billy Flynn represent her.
* We want Billy *
* Double- L, Y *
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the silver tongue, the prince of the courtroom, the one, the only...
* Don' t mean a thing *
* Honest, mister, * * I' m a millionaire *
* No, no, not me *
Good morning, ladies.
Not guilty!
You tell him, sweetheart.
* That' s what he' s here for *
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Miss Kelly, do you remember anything at all about that night?
I passed out completely, Miss Sunshine.
Only that I didn' t do it.
No.
But my client is offering a substantial reward to anyone with information about this crime.
- I don' t know.
How much?
- We' il work it out after the trial.
Now, if there are no more questions, Miss Kelly and I have a lot of work to do.
What' s all this about a reward?
Awfully dumb reporters.
- Thank you!
* All he cares about is love *
- Mr. Flynn, I’ m Roxie Hart.
- Who?
Oh, yeah.
Right.
The cute one.
I was hoping that you might represent me.
You have $5, 000?
That' s a lot of money.
Mama didn' t say anything about $5, 000.
Lookit, Mr. Flynn.
I’ m not very good at this sort of thing, but...
Maybe we could... make some sort of arrangement between us.
And I can be an awfully good sport.
Good, you got that out of your system.
Now listen, you mean just one thing to me.
You call me when you' ve got $5, 000.
* Flowin 'down,' bout to there *
* No, no, not me *
* Doin 'the guy in *
* That' s turnin 'the screw *
* is love! *
Oh, he' il see you now.
Hello, Andy.
Amos, my name is Amos.
That' s right.
- You know, you' re a remarkable man.
Plugs the guy and tries to pin it on you.
Most men would let a dame like that swing, but no, you' re sticking by her.
That' s right.
I’ m a hero.
Did you bring the money?
I didn' t do as well as I hoped.
But,
I will, Mr. Flynn.
This is only a thousand.
Plus this $300 I borrowed from the guys down at the garage, and there' s 7... $700 from the Building and Loan Fund. $2, 000
And that' s all I got so far.
But I’ il give you $20 off my salary every week.
Double, triple, until every cent is paid, I promise.
I didn' t ask if she was innocent.
I didn' t ask if she was a drunk, or a dope fiend.
No.
All I said was, Do you have $5, 000?
But you don' t have $5, 000!
So I figure you' re a dirty liar and I don' t waste my time with dirty liars.
Look...
I’ m real sorry, Mr. Flynn.
On the other hand, your devotion to your wife is really very touching.
Because I play square.
Now look, Hart.
I don' t like to blow my own horn.
But believe me.
If Jesus Christ had lived in Chicago today and if he had $5, 000 and he' d come to me, things would have turned out differently.
By the end of the week, I’ m gonna have Roxie' s name on the front page of every newspapers in town.
Sweetest little jazz killer ever to hit Chicago.
That' s the angle I’ m after.
You make an announcement, we' re gonna have an auction.
Tell them we gotta raise some money for the defense.
They' il buy everything she' s ever touched.
Your shoes, your dresses, your perfume, your underwear.
And the Victrola records.
Like the one I was playing when I shot the bastard.
I didn' t hear that!
Not that I didn' t have "grounds", mind you.
Hey, what are they?
That' s when we go to trial.
Look, nobody' s gonna care a lick what your defense is unless they care about you.
So first thing we gotta do is work up some sympathy from the press.
There is one thing that they can never resist.
And that is a reformed sinner.
- What was your favorite subject in school?
- Oh, I was a real dummy.
There must be something that you were really good at.
I got high marks in Courtesy and Hygiene.
- Perfect, you wanted to be a nun.
- On a chicken farm outside of Lubbock.
Beautiful southern home, filled with every luxury and refinement.
Where are your parents now?
Probably on the front porch in their rocking chairs.
Parents dead.
You were educated at the Sacred Heart.
Then you fell into a runaway marriage.
Left you miserable, alone, unhappy.
And of course you got all swept up in the mad whirl of this city.
Jazz, cabarets, liquor.
- A moth?
And now the mad whirl has ceased, and you are a butterfly, crushed on the wheel!
Is it the moth or the butterfly?
- You have sinned and you' re sorry.
- God, that' s beautiful.
Cut out God.
Stay where you' re better acquainted.
Kid, when I’ m through with you, not only will you be acquitted, but every man on that jury will wanna take you home to meet his mother.
I was born on a beautiful southern convent.
What?
Oh, holy shit!
Oh, I’ m never gonna get this straight!
Pipe down the swearin '.
Now try it again.
- I was born on...
I thought I’ d get all teary- eyed and ask for your handkerchief.
Then I thought I’ d take a peek at the jury like this.
Flashin 'a bit of thigh, heh?
What do you think?
Hey, don' t you want to hear the rest?
Tomorrow, kiddo.
You' re at the top of my list.
Well, well, well.
Sorry to be late, Mr. Flynn.
Hope you aren' t too bored.
I like it.
I heard your press conference is tomorrow.
Yeah, what' s it to you?
Well, you wanted my advice, right?
Well, here it is.
Don' t forget Billy Flynn' s number- one client is Billy Flynn.
Meaning what?
Meaning, don' t let him hug the spotlight.
You' re the one they pay to see.
Remember, we can only sell them one idea at a time.
I can still see him coming at me with that awful look in his eyes.
And we... both reached for the gun.
That' s right, you both reached for the gun.
- Ready?
Good day gentlemen, gentlemen, Miss Sunshine.
My client has just entered a plea of not guilty.
We look forward to a trial at the earliest possible date.
Now are there any questions?
As you know, my paper is dry.
Do you have any advice for young girls, seeking to avoid a life of jazz and drink?
Absolutely yes.
Mrs. Hart feels that it was the tragic combination of liquor and jazz, which lead to her downfall.
Next question, please.
I would just like to say how flattered I am that you all came to see me.
You see, I was a moth... crushed on the wheel.
You know, a butterfly, drawn to the...
I bet you want to know why I shot the bastard.
Shut up, dummy.
Mr. Billy Flynn in the Press Conference Rag.
Notice how his mouth never moves... almost.
Where' d you come from?
* Mississippi *
And your parents?
* Very wealthy. *
* Six feet under. *
* But she was granted one more start *
* The convent of The Sacred Heart! *
* When' d you get here? *
* Don' t remember *
* Convinced me to * * elope one day *
Oh, you poor dear, I can' t believe what you' ve been through.
A convent girl, a runaway marriage.
* My ex- boyfriend. *
* She knew that she was doin 'wrong. *
* He came toward me. *
* From my bureau. *
* Like a tiger. *
* Oh yes, oh yes, * * oh yes we both *
* Yes, it' s perfectly * * understandable *
* Comprehensible.
* It' s so defensible! *
* Are you sorry? *
* Are you kidding? *
* What' s you' re statement? *
* Though my choo- choo * * jumped the track *
* - What? * * - Jazz and liquor *
* Oh yes, they both * * reached for *
* Oh yes, they both *
* Oh yes, they both *
* Oh yes, they both *
* Both reached for the... gun *
Move over Al Capone,
The windy city has taken a new criminal to its height.
The name on everybody' s lips is, Roxie Hart.
The sweetest little lady ever accused of murder in Chicago.
Women want to look like her.
Fellows want to go out with her.
Some little girls even want to take her home.
Don' t get any ideas, little lady.
On the other side of town, the assistant D. A. promises the gay little sharp- shooter will swing before the year is up.
If he lives up to his word,
Assistant D. A. Harrison might become Governor Harrison some day.
Back at the scene of the crime, everybody wants a little piece of Roxie Hart.
This jar of cold cream set her husband back 20 dollars!
Maybe this pretty little lady will get some of that famous Roxie style.
It seems everybody these days is rooting for...
Take those wilted flowers over to the orphanage and make sure they know who sent them.
Given it any thought of what you wanna do after Billy gets you off?
Yeah, I think I’ d like to go on the stage.
Yeah, I figured as much.
I already called the Morris office.
How much is that gonna cost me?
A fair deal.
10% of all your takings.
We' il see, Mama.
Besides, I don' t even have an act yet.
Killing Fred Casely was your act.
To say they saw somebody famous.
It’ s a freak act.
And besides, I am better than that.
Of course you are, cupcake.
I mean, you can be as big as Sophie Tucker.
You really think so?
Bigger than Kanther and Juleson combined.
You know, I’ ve always wanted to have my name in all the papers.
Before I met Amos, I used to date this well- to- do, ugly bootlegger.
He used to take me out and show me off.
Ugly guys like to do that.
Once it said in the paper,
"Gangland' s Al Capelli seen at Chez Vito with cute blonde corinne."
That was me.
I clipped and I saved it.
You know all my life, I wanted to have my own act.
But, no...
It' s always no, they always turn me down.
One big world full of no.
And then Amos came along.
Safe, sweet Amos.
I’ ve never done this before.
But you know, it is such a special night and you are such a great audience!
I really feel like I can talk to you, you know?
So forget what you' ve read in the papers.
And forget what you' ve heard on the radio.
Because... because I’ m gonna tell you the truth.
Not that the truth really matters.
But I’ m gonna tell you anyway.
In the apartment, Amos was... zero.
I mean, when he made love to me, it goes like...
It was like he was fixing a carburetor or something.
I love you, honey...
I started foolin 'around.
Which is... fooling around without dinner.
Who said that he could get me into Vaudeville.
But that didn' t quite work out like I planned.
I guess it didn' t really work out too great for Fred either.
So I gave up on the whole Vaudeville idea.
* But it ain' t *
* Oh no, no, no, no. * * But it ain' t *
And now, with this Flynn guy, with all these publicity,
I got me a world full of yes!
* Roxie *
* Roxie *
* They' re gonna recognize my eyes *
* Roxie *
* Who says that * * murder' s not an art? *
* can say she started * * with a bang? *
* Roxie Hart! *
* To get to see *
* And I' il appear in a lavaliere *
I' m a star.
And I love them.
And I love them for loving me.
And we love each other.
And that' s' cause none of us got enough love in our childhoods.
And that' s show biz.
Kid.
* She' s giving up here humdrum life *
* She made a scandal and a start. *
* Roxie Hart! *
I just can' t take it anymore.
I can' t go anywhere without hearing about that dumb tomato!
Oh, Mama, not you too.
The tour has been cancelled.
Your name has been out of the papers too long.
All you read about today, is that Hart kid.
She' s hot.
Suck up to her like everybody else?
It couldn' t hurt.
Over my dead body.
Mind if I join you?
Lights out, 10 minutes.
Smoke?
Triple- cream caramels, all the way from San Francisco.
I’ m watching my figure.
You know, the trial.
Hey, great mention of you in the Trib 'today, huh?
There have been so many, I just can' t keep track.
You' re exactly same size as my sister.
I mean, you' d fit into her costumes perfectly.
Really?
Yeah, and I was thinking, you know, with all the publicity that' s piled up between us, and when Billy gets us off, we' d be a natural to do an act together.
You think so, huh?
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Velma Kelly in Act... of Desperation.
* My sister and I had an act * * that couldn' t flop *
* My sister and I were headed * * straight for the top *
* My sister and I earned a * * thou 'a week at least *
* I know it' s sad, of course *
Watch this.
Now you have to imagine it with 2 people.
It' s swell with 2 people.
* First I' d... *
* But I can' t do it alone! *
* Then she' d... *
* But I can' t do it alone! *
* She' d say, * * "What' s your sister like?" *
* I' d say, "Men," *
* She' d say, * * "You' re the cat' s meow" *
* I' d go... *
* Yelling, screaming, * * begging for more. *
* And we' d say, "O. K. fellas, * * keep your socks up. *
* 'cause you ain' t seen * * nothin' yet! "*
* alone! *
So what do you think, huh?
Come on, you can say.
The first part is shit.
The second part is really nifty.
* She' d go... *
* I' d go... *
* We' d go... *
* And then those two- bit Johnnies did it a brown *
* To cheer the best * * attraction in town *
* They nearly tore the balcony down *
* And we' d say.
"Okay, boys... *
* we' re goin 'home, but before we go * * here' s a few more partin' shots! "*
* this we did in perfect unison. *
* But I simply cannot do it *
So where' s the part where you blew her brains out?
I’ il...
I' il level with you...
No, don' t bother.
You think you' re fooling me?
You' re all washed up.
And it' s me they want now, and I’ m a big star.
Single.
Oh, I almost forgot.
You were in the paper today too.
With the obituaries.
Velma Kelly' s trial has been postponed indefinitely.
Seven words.
And here' s a little piece of advice.
Direct from me to you.
Lay off the caramels.
And now, for all you Chicago' s stay- up- laters.
You night owls who only come alive after dark,
We dedicate this tune:
Chicago After Midnight.
This all took place in Lake Shore Drive?
Incredible.
All right.
They just arrested this woman for triple homicide.
Really?
Yeah, get this.
She' s an heiress.
And all her family is in the... pineapples... grapefruit, some kind of fruit, I don' t know.
She' s playing house.
On the north side in an apartment, with a guy named Harry.
But it doesn' t really matter because she' s footing all the bills.
Harry' s already in bed,
She goes to change.
When she returns, she notices something... rather odd.
Extremely odd.
Kitty disappears for a second.
Cool as a cucumber.
When she returns, she gently wakes up Harry.
Harry says, "What?
I’ m alone! "
She says, "Alone?
You have two other women in bed with you! "
So, get this, Harry... he says, "Come on, darling,"
"you gonna believe what you see or what I tell you?"
Good night, folks.
Mary Sunshine from The Evening Star.
I wonder if you would mind saying a word or two?
Sure I’ il say three.
Please direct your questions to her counsel.
I want my money back!
It’ s your mother' s money.
Are you sorry, dear?
Sure I' m sorry.
Sorry I got caught.
- Okay, Miss Sunshine.
- Not now, Roxie.
I got a letter from a guy.
He says he' s going on a hunger strike until I’ m free.
That' s nice, kid.
Miss Baxter, did you know these two ladies personally?
Did I know these two ladies personally?
Was that your question?
Yeah, that' s my ques...
Miss Baxter...
Hey, Mr. Flynn.
- Yeah, hi, Tracy.
- It’ s Roxie.
Did you get my trial date yet?
- I’ m on top of your list, right?
What a helling, huh?
And socialite too.
Her mother owns all the pineapples in Hawaii.
- All right, all right...
Hey!
That' s all for the questions. and afterwards I' il be happy to give the interview myself.
Billy...
How does it feel, kid?
J. Edgar Hoover couldn' t find your name in the papers.
Mr. Flynn?
Someone open this door immediately.
Oh, my god.
Roxie!
What is it dear?
Don' t worry about me.
Oh, I only hope the fall didn' t... hurt the baby.
Baby?
Cheat!
Roxie, when did this happen, darling?
Is she or isn' t she?
She is.
Would you swear that statement in court?
- Yes.
- Good.
Button your fly.
I would just like to say that my own life doesn' t matter now, just that of my unborn child.
Poor dear, to have your baby born in jail...
My readers won' t stand for this.
I can assure you that won' t happen.
You can quote me on that.
I think it' s sweet.
First time we ever have one where a girl' s knocked up.
When is the baby due, Roxie?
Hey, Roxie...
I just heard the good news!
I’ m the father.
Hey, Roxie, who' s the father?
The question is completely out of line.
How dare you insult this... this brave, young woman?
That' s enough.
Roxie, honey!
It’ s me, daddy!
It' s daddy!
Roxie, I came as soon as I could.
* And waved his arm * * and shook his leg *
* Yelled:
* You' d notice him *
* Cellophane *
* Shoulda been my name *
* Walk right by me *
* I tell ya *
* Cellophane *
* Shoulda been my name *
* Walk right by me *
Oh, I didn' t see you.
Sit down.
Look, Andy, I’ m afraid I gotta hit you hard.
And I can only hope that you' il be big about it.
- Amos, my name is Amos.
- Who said it wasn' t?
Oh, it was the kid... kid' s name I was thinking about.
September.
You' il pass out those cigars anyway.
- I don' t want you to give a damn when people...
- People what?
- Laugh.
Why would they laugh?
'Cause they can count.
Can you count?
September.
Here' s a copy of Roxie' s first statement from the D. A. 's office.
Says she hadn' t copulated with you for four months prior to the incident.
Well, she would know.
Yeah, I guess we hadn' t done no copulatin 'since...
Wait a minute.
I couldn' t be the father.
Well, forget about that now.
My client needs your support.
You mean she needs a meal ticket?
That' s all I’ ve ever been.
But this time she' s gone too far.
What are you gonna do?
- You' re damn right!
I’ il divorce her!
She probably won' t even notice.
Yeah.
Yeah, put him through.
* Unless that human bein '* * next to you *
- You' re still here Ed?
- Yeah, I’ m still here.
I think...
* Shoulda been my name *
* Walk right by me *
* I tell ya *
* Cellophane *
* Shoulda been my name *
* Walk right by me *
* I' m there. *
I hope I didn' t take up too much of your time.
I’ ve been waiting here for 10 minutes.
Don' t do that again.
I’ m not wearing this.
- You' re wearing it because I tell you to wear it.
- I’ m not wearing this dress.
And when Andy' s on the stand, I want you to do knitting.
Knitting?
- A baby garment.
- I don' t know how to knit!
- Then learn.
- That' s no way to win a jury' s sympathy.
- Oh, you don' t need advice anymore?
- Lookit here, Mr. Mouthpiece.
It seems to me that I’ m the one who' s coming up with the good ideas.
I’ m sick of everybody telling me what to do.
And you treat me like dirt.
You treat me like I' m some dumb, common criminal.
But you are some dumb, common criminal.
Well, it' s better than being a greasy, mick lawyer.
- Who happens to be saving your ass.
- Who' s out for all he can steal!
Maybe you' d like to appeal in court without me.
Maybe I could.
Have you read the morning papers?
- They love me!
They' d love you a lot more if you were hanged.
'Cause they' d sell more papers.
- You' re fired.
- I quit.
Any lawyer in this town would die to have my case.
You' re a phony celebrity.
You' re flash in the pan and in a couple of weeks, no one' s gonna give a shit about you.
That' s Chicago.
What happened?
She lost her last appeal.
So what does that mean?
What that means, is that...
Next week, she' s gonna...
This is Mary Sunshine, coming to you from the Cook County Jail, where history will be made today.
Katelin Helinsky will become the first woman in the state of illinois to be executed.
And so ladies and gentlemen...
And now, ladies and gentlemen, for your pleasure and your entertainment, we proudly present Katelin Helinsky and her famous Hungarian Disappearing Act.
You know, it' s really not that bad.
Yep.
I’ ve been up all night rehearsing.
What do you do when Harrison starts coming after you?
I sit still and look straight ahead.
Never at the jury.
- And?
- And I look modest.
- And?
- And...
- And say nothing.
- That' s right!
- Right.
You ask me back, I do all the talking this time.
Absolutely, Billy.
Whatever you say.
- Mr. Flynn, his honor is here.
- Thank you.
You ready?
Yeah.
I’ m scared.
Don' t be.
Believe me, you' ve got nothing to worry about.
It’ s all a circus.
A three- ring circus.
These trials, the whole world...
But Kid,...
You' re working with a star.
* Give 'em an act with * * lots of flash in it *
* What if, in fact, * * you' re just disgusting? *
* And they' il never catch wise! *
* Give 'em a show * * that' s so splendiferous *
* They' il never know * * you' re just a bagel, *
* And they' il beg you for more! *
- I Object!
- Sustained.
* Back since the days * * of old Methuselah *
- Hello, Amos.
- Amos?
That' s right, Mr. Flynn.
Amos, when did you file suit for divorce?
A month ago.
Was there any reason for filing at this particular time?
The newspapers said Roxie was expecting a little stranger.
That' s hardly ground for divorce, is it?
A little too much of a stranger.
By that you mean you doubted the paternity of the child.
Well, sure.
Do you share a bed with your wife?
Yes, sir, every night.
You expect this jury to believe that you slept next to this woman every night without exercising your rights as a husband?
- I could have if I wanted to.
- Oh, but you didn' t.
- Did what?
- Want to.
- But you didn' t.
- Didn' t what?
- What you wanted.
Wait a minute, I’ m getting confused here.
Hey, tell me Hart.
Did you ever question Roxie herself?
Did you even bother to ask her if you were the father of her child?
- No, sir.
If you became convinced that you were wrong, you' d be man enough to admit it.
You' d even be willing to take her back if Roxie swore that you are the father of her child,
- which she does.
She does!
No more questions!
You can step down now.
Well done, Andy.
Roxie, I’ m so sorry.
* Razzle- dazzle them *
* Razzle- dazzle 'em *
This is the moment we' ve been waiting for.
Roxie Hart finally takes the stand in her own defense.
* And they' il make you a star! *
Proceed, Mr. Flynn.
Roxie, I have here a statement in which you admit to having... illicit relations with the deceased, Fred Casely.
- Is this statement true or false?
- I’ m afraid that' s true.
You' re an honest girl, Roxie.
When did you first meet Fred Casely?
When he sold Amos and me our furniture.
Can you tell the jury when that began?
When I permitted him to escort me home one night,
I don' t think I would' ve gone with him if Mr. Hart and me hadn' t quarreled that very morning.
- Quarreled?
- Yes, sir.
Well, I suppose it was his fault.
Oh, no, sir.
It was my fault.
I suppose I just couldn' t stop pestering him.
Pestering him?
About what?
I didn' t like him working those long hours at the garage.
I wanted him home with me... to darn his socks and iron his shirts.
I wanted a real home, and a child.
So you drifted into this illicit relationship because you were unhappy at home.
Yes, I was most unhappy.
The state has accused you of the murder of Fred Casely.
Are you guilty or not guilty?
I’ m not guilty...
I’ m not guilty!
But I’ m not a criminal.
I’ m not a criminal...
Roxie...
Do you recall the night of January 14th?
Could you tell the jury, in your own words, the happenings of that night.
When Fred came over, I told him the good news.
And what was that?
That me and Amos were gonna have a baby.
And that it was all over between us.
What happened then?
Then...
Did he threaten you, Roxie?
Objection, your honor.
Counsel is leading the witness.
Sustained.
What does Casely say when you told him the news?
I’ il kill you before I see you have another man' s child!
Could you tell the audience... the jury, what happened next?
In his passion, he... tore off my robe and he threw me on the bed.
And Mr. Hart' s pistol was lying there between us.
And then!
And then we both reached for the gun but I got it first.
And then he came towards me with this funny look in his eyes.
He was angry and wild!
- Wild!
- Wild!
Oh, yes, sir!
Yes sir!
So it was his life or yours!
Not just mine.
I closed my eyes and I shot!
In defense of your life!
To save my husband' s innocent unborn child.
What a bull' s eye, huh?
- Order in this court!
It' s pandemonium here in the courtroom...
Mrs. Hart' s behavior throughout this ordeal has been truly extraordinary.
Opening her eyes, she fans herself with her attorney' s handkerchief.
- Poor child has had no relief.
She looks around now, bewildered, seeming to want something.
Oh, it' s a glass of water.
Oh, Mama, that was my bid!
I was gonna do that on my trial!
But now her eyes flutter wildly and she...
Mrs. Hart has fainted again.
She flumps over, her chiffon dress up around her knees, revealing a glimpse of a blue garter with rhinestone buckle.
Oh, Mama, she stole my garter.
Don' t break my radio!
First the slob steals my publicity, then she steals my lawyer, my trial date,
- now she stole my goddamn garter.
- What do you expect?
I mean these days you get a little success and it' s good riddance to the people who put you here.
And there ain' t nothing you can do about it.
You think I got you up here just so you can listen to my radio?
People write some pretty interesting things when they think no one' s looking.
State calls a rebuttal witness.
You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing by the truth, so help you God?
- And then some.
Would you state your name for the record please.
Velma Kelly.
Miss Kelly, will you please tell the court if the object I’ m holding is the one you happened to came upon in the defendant' s jail cell?
I submit this as Exhibit X.
Roxie Hart' s diary.
I object!
My client has never kept a diary.
And even if she did, this would be invasion of privacy and violation of fourth amendment and illegal search without a warrant.
Yeah, and she broke the lock!
Order!
Well, that settles that.
I’ il allow it.
What' s the big deal?
It' s just a bunch of doodlings.
If you would read for us, please, Miss Kelly.
I haven' t worked in a while.
- What a laugh, pluggin 'Fred Casely.
The big baboon had it comin '.
I’ m just sorry I only got to kill him once.
You...
- She made that up.
- Order!
Please, Mr. Flynn, get control of your client.
It won' t happen again.
Sit down and shut up.
You' re making it worse.
I have no more questions.
Your witness, Mr. Flynn.
Ladies and gentlemen, a tap dance.
Tell me, Miss Kelly, did you make a deal with Mr. Harrison?
Maybe to drop all charges against you in exchange for testifying here today?
Oh, sure.
I’ m not a complete idiot.
Good.
Maybe you' il do me the same honor?
- I’ d be delighted.
Fred Casely assured me he' d get me an audition down at the Onyx.
And then he reneged on his pledge and that was my motive for attackin 'him.
The bit fat liar who welshed on a deal, so I shot him.
So I told him that the charge was...
-... erroneous.
- Objection, your honor.
Mr. Flynn is twisting this evidence to draw conclusions that are specious and...
- Erroneous?
- Exactly.
Order!
Miss Kelly, do you know the meaning of the word perjury?
- Yes.
For example if it turns out that you knew that this diary was a fake,
I’ d hate to think of you rotting away in prison for the next 10 years especially since you just won your freedom.
Look, all I know is what I was told.
So you didn' t find this diary in Roxie' s cell?
No.
Miss Morton gave it to me.
She said someone had sent it to her.
Any idea who this mysterious benefactor might be?
She didn' t know.
All right, let' s see if we can work this out.
Someone who writes about "reneging on pledges"
And... "erroneous charges"...
Call me crazy, doesn' t that sound like a lawyer to you?
A lawyer who honestly had a sample of my client' s handwriting.
Mr. Harrison, didn' t you ask Roxie to write out a confession for you?
Yes, but you' re not suggesting that I tamper with evidence, are you?
No, let' s not be ridiculous.
That' s thoroughly and utterly absurd.
But now that you mention it...
Your honor, this is outrageous.
It outrageous!
The prosecutor would make a thief' s bargain with notorious Velma Kelly.
And then fabricate the very evidence that set her free!
Just so you can win another case and move one step closer to the governor' s mansion
- Why it' d simply be an unimaginable...
- I' il hold you in contempt.
No, it' s not even conceivable.
Come clean, Mr. Harrison, come clean...
Even in Chicago, this kind of corruption cannot stand.
Will not stand!
That' s enough, Mr. Flynn!
This is enough!
The defense rests.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mary Sunshine reporting live from the Cook County Courthouse.
The city of Chicago has come to a complete standstill.
As the trial of the century finally draws to a close.
Mrs. Hart sits quietly at the defense table, hands folded, wondering what fate has in store for her?
And now a hush falls over the courtroom as the 12 men of the jury file slowly back to their seats.
Gentlemen of jury, have you reached a verdict?
We have, your honor.
The jury has reached a verdict.
Will the defendant please rise?
What is your verdict?
We, the jury, find the defendant...
Roxie Hart is innocent!
She' s innocent!
Get your paper!
Roxie Hart is free!
She' s free!
First she shoots the husband then she plugs the lawyer!
Hey, don' t you wanna take my picture?
Hey, I’ m the famous Roxie Hart.
Hey, what happened?
What the hell happened?
This is Chicago, kid.
You can' t beat fresh blood on the walls.
My name in the papers.
I was counting on that.
Your gratitude is overwhelming, kid.
I just saved your life.
Yeah, and you got $5, 000.
I get nothing?
Five?
Actually it' s ten once I collect from Velma.
I get nothing?
Don' t forget your blessed diary.
Hope you don' t mind.
I added a few erroneous phrases in there.
Sorry, I couldn' t tell you.
Couldn' t take the chance.
Never lost a case.
You' re a free woman, Roxie Hart.
And God save illinois.
Roxie.
What do you want?
I want you to come home.
You said you still wanted to... and the baby...
Baby, what baby?
Oh, Jesus.
What do you take me for?
There ain' t no baby.
There ain' t no baby?
They didn' t even want my picture.
I just can' t understand that.
What didn' t they even want my picture?
* Isn' t it, great? *
Miss Roxie Hart says...
Good Night.
* everywhere booze *
* everywhere *
* You can live * * the life you like *
Didn' t she kill a guy a while back?
* And that' s *
That' s great.
We' il be in touch.
You know I’ m not quite finished yet.
Wait... one more.
I could... just a second I' m not...
Goddamn it!
Thank you!
Thanks.
You know you' re really pretty good.
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
I heard you' ve been... making the rounds.
Yeah, well, if it was up to you, I' d be swingin 'by now.
Come on, I always knew Billy' d get you off.
You should learn how to put things behind you.
I’ il put that at the top of my list right after finding a job and an apartment with a john.
- Just shut up and listen to me?
- You really are something.
All full of advice for a poor slob like me.
Let me tell you something, Miss Velma Kelly.
I got a new life now.
Fine.
I just thought we could help each other out.
Look...
Listen to me.
I talked to this guy downtown.
He said one jazz girl is nothing these days, but two...
We can make a couple o 'hundred a week.
Think about it, Roxie.
Our faces back in the papers our names on the marquee.
"Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart"
Shouldn' t it be alphabetical?
That could work.
A couple o 'hundred?
- Maybe we could ask for a thou '.
Forget it, it' il never work.
- Why not?
- 'Cause I hate you.
There' s only one business in the world where that' s no problem at all.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Chicago theatre is proud to announce a first.
The first time anywhere there' s been an act of this nature.
Not only one little lady, but two.
You read about them in the papers, and now here they are.
Chicago' s own killer dillers, those scintillating sinners,
Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly!
* You can even marry Harry *
Okay, you babes of Jazz, let' s pick up the pace.
Let' s make the parties longer, let' s make the skirts shorter.
Let' s all go to hell in a fast car and keep it hot!
Me and Roxie, we' d just like to say thank you.
Thank you!
Believe us, we could not have done it without you!
* Jazz! *
I, Reuben, take you, Lisa...
I, Reuben, take you, Lisa, to be my lawfully wedded wife.
I do.
The room looks beautiful.
And all the candles have been replaced... with these mini- lamps you asked for, so now no more fire hazard.
Great.
Hey, did we sanitize these things?
- The best man is in the house!
Ohh!
- Oh, my God.!
- Sandy, you okay?
The best man went down.
Dance floor' s like a Slip 'N Slide, dude.
I thought I told them not to wax this.
Twenty- three percent of the guests are over 70.
I don' t want anyone breaking a hip.
I' m gonna take care of it.
I analyze risk for a living.
Okay, let me do the worrying 'cause you gotta get married.
Right.
I' m good.
You got my note that Harry Bard at table seven is violently allergic to seafood?
His chicken will go nowhere near the fish.
We' re putting the finishing touches on the cake.
This looks great.
Hit me, dude.
Hey, aren' t you that kid from Crocodile Tears?
That' s right.
Man, I saw that movie in high school.
That bagpipe scene, that was the funniest shit, man.
We had a good time on that picture.
Ah, no, thanks.
I thought you died, like, 15 years ago.
I' m very much alive, my friend.
Getting back to my roots.
- Sandy, we should get going 'cause...
- They' re making an E.!
True Hollywood Story on me, so that should clear up a lot of your questions.
So they' re really doing one of those shows about your life?
I got a camera crew following me around the next few weeks.
It' s gonna be huge.
Reuben.
Okay, thanks.
Look, Reuben.
Uh- huh.
And I' m your wingman.
Okay.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Sandy, there' s not a doubt in my mind.
I found the perfect woman.
We' re totally in love.
My life' s working out just like I planned.
Let' s go get married.
- [Glass Breaks]
Go on.
Big smile, everyone!
You love each other.
Smile, Grandma.
I' m Stan Indursky, Reuben' s boss.
You' re very kind.
Now, Reub' s not the sort of fellow to brag about his own success, so I' m going to do it for him.
The fact is, this young man here... is the best risk assessment expert... in this whole meshugas we call the insurance business.
Irving, Vivian, you' ve raised a wonderful son.
Let' s hear it for him.
Reuben, Lisa, let me just say... that I would insure your marriage any day of the week.
Good things.
Oh, and, Lisa, don' t tire him out too bad on the honeymoon.
- I need this kid fresh when he gets back.
- Mazel, mazel.!
I' ve been waiting for this day my entire life.
And about four and a half years ago, I met a real estate agent named Lisa Kramer,
Who showed me an apartment, which I rented just so she' d go out with me.
I gave him a good price.
She' s a killer.
No, seriously, um...
After about a month of dating, I knew she was the one.
And I couldn' t be happier... that on this day that I' ve been dreaming about for so long, the woman I' m standing next to... is you.
[Lisa Laughing]
Oh, my goodness.!
I lost my shoe!
Look at this place!
It' s beautiful.
What?
How' s your bruise?
It' s okay.
You know, it' s a little sore.
You know, they really should tell you if they' rejust gonna let komodo dragons run loose around the hotel.
Really.
How about this one?
"Recently renovated colonial in Montclair, three- bedroom."
We took a virtual tour of this one on the Internet.
It was perfect, but just a little pricey.
Oh, right, right.
It' s probably off the market anyway.
Why do you say that?
You what?
I bought it!
Reuben, I' m in shock.
I mean, you just... you don' t... you don' t do things like that.
You love it, right?
Yes, I do, but, Reuby...
We have a house!
Oh, my God, we have a house!
Honey!
- [Laughs]
How' s it going?
Uh, it' s, uh, going great.
So I see you gang are new to the island.
I want to come have a meet with you, show you my boat.
That is my boat there on the sandbar.
- Yeah, it' s pretty good size.
It' s good size.
So, tell me true, are you guys for scuba?
What does that mean?
I' m like the unofficial scuba king of St. Barts, so if you are for scuba, I take you out on the boat,
I show you the coral reef, and we have kinda like a...
That sounds great, but we' re not certified, so we' re gonna have to pass.
I get you resort- certified couple of hour.
- Oh, I have always wanted to try it.
My name is Claude.
What is, uh, you guys' name?
This is my wife, Lisa.
"Leuban," I am here all afternoon.
All right, au revoir, Leuban, Lisa.
Solid.
How' s it going?
Leuban!
Lisa!
Hi!
Hello.
Isn' t this exciting?
I think I' m gonna skip the scuba diving.
Reuben, no.
They all said that this guy was the best.
I know, but you know how I am about boats, and I' m feeling a little queasy.
Your stomach' s acting funny?
You know how it gets, you know?
So why don' t you go?
We' re on our honeymoon.
I' m not gonna go without you.
I want you to go, okay?
It' il be fun.
I' il pick you up like at 4: 00, all right?
I love you.
I love you too.
You' re not for scuba, Leuban?
- I' m gonna go run some errands in town.
But you guys go.
Can I talk to you for a second though?
- [No Audible Dialogue]
Hey, listen, this woman means more to me than anything else in the world, so be careful 'cause scuba can be very dangerous if the proper precautions aren' t taken.
Leuban, look to me in my eyeball.
I promise you I take care of Lisa as if she were my own flesh and blood.
Okay?
Okay.
Solid!
Solid.
Are you ready?
Yeah, yeah.
So is there gonna be a little boat that comes over...
[Screams]
Au revoir, Leuban.
Bye- bye, honey.!
I love you.!
I love you!?
Claude!?
Guys?
Hello.!?
We' rejammin '??
Lisa?
[Metal Clanging]
Oh, my God.
Ooh la la.!
Ooh la la.!
Oh, my God!
Holy shit, Leuban!
This is not what it look like.
- You' re staying on the island with Claude?
- I' m a little confused right now, Reuben.
I think I need a little time just to figure things out.
Did you mess around with her oxygen tanks or something?
I did nothing, Leuban.
My name is not "Leuban"!
It is "Reuben"!
Look, we had a scuba, we talk about life, we drink some white wine.
We cannot help it.
It is like love at first sight.
She make like the fire in my trouser.
Reuben, itjust... it happened.
It' s like the story of the hippo.
I' m not familiar with that story.
No way, José.
So he tried to paint the stripe on himself to be like the zebra, but he fool no one.
And then he tried to put the spot on his skin to be like the leopard, but everyone know he is a hippo.
So at certain point, he look himself in the mirror, and hejust say,
"Hey, I am a hippopotamus, and there is nothing I can do about it."
And as soon as he accepts this, he live life happy.
Happy as a hippo.
You understand?
- I' m gonna kill you!
- Reuben.!
- Leuban, this is not the way!
You' re gonna be fine, Reuben.
No, I' m not gonna be fine.
- [Engine Starts]
'Cause this ship has sailed.
Hey, Tina.
Hey, Mitch.
Hey, Reub.
- Cheryl.
Indursky and Sons, how may I help you?
What?
How does everyone know about this?
Your mother called Mr. Indursky and told him what happened.
I am so sorry, Reuben.
Thanks, Gladys.
Okay.
Thank you.
All right.
Okay.
Hey, there he is!
The big man' s back.
I want to spitball something with you.
I' m just gonna run to the men' s room.
I' il join you.
I heard about your honeymoon.
Just terrible.
I knew that girl was a slut the second I met her.
Yeah, well, you know, it' s kind of complicated.
Hey, don' t make excuses.
She' s a dime- store hooker, and she always will be.
Just put it behind you.
Speaking of which, you ever hear of a guy named Leland Van Lew?
Yeah, yeah.
Australian guy, right?
[Farts]
[Urinating]
Yeah, he started one of those high- tech, modem- scrotum,
Jesus Christ.
They want to take the company public, and if he wants to remain the C. E. O. Of a publicly held company, guess what he needs.
Bingo was his name.
All right, you want me to check him out?
There' s just one catch.
This Van Lew has a reputation as a cowboy.
[Splashing]
All right.
Well, let' s make sure he checks out first and...
You see?
This is why you' re the only one I can trust with these jobs.
I was worried that you' d been through hell and back with that whore wife of yours.
I' m good.
Yeah, no, I' m fine.
All right?
All right, good things.
This is private property.
I just bought this house.
I move in next month.
Mr. Phifer, right?
Feffer.
Yeah, but you can just call me Reuben.
Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Thanks.
Sorry about your wife, Reuben.
First of all, I just want to say thank you to everybody for coming out, and this has just been an incredible day and night.
It' s just so great to see all these people, friends and family and...
To tell you the truth, I' ve been waiting for this day my entire life.
Thanks.
Thanks, Sandy.
Thank you.
We' re rolling.
Sound speed.
What the hell is this?
True Hollywood Story on me.
Sorry about your wife.
Sandy, do you want us over here?
Put it over by the table.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, thanks.
Look, you can forget it.
I' m not going to a party.
What do you think is gonna happen?
No, of course not.
I' m just... -
I mean, what can I say?
Hold on.
Let me see something here.
You' re my wife.
Man, it feels good to say that.!
Ah, and, uh...
Man, it feels good to say that!
She' s terrified.
- She' s smiling.
- I' m a student of acting, Reuben.
She' s faking it.
The woman got spooked.
She needed to explore, which is exactly what you' re gonna do.
Don' t turn your back on that.
I don' t want freedom, Sandy!
I want to be married!
I bought a goddamn house!
- [Laughing]
- Look at her.
She' s not thinking about having a deep, committed relationship... with a complex individual like yourself.
- No.!
She' s daydreaming about having hot, shallow sex with a French nudist.!
"Oh, I' m hugging.
Oh, I love you so much.
"Liar.!
So whose party is this again?
It' s an art opening for this Dutch guy, Jost.
His art sucks, but he used to sell me really good pot.
Oh, man, I' m so friggin 'horny.??
Look, just don' t leave me alone, okay?
Relax.
I' m your wingman.
I' il be right by your side the whole time.
So what do we do?
Do we, like, get a drink... or take a lap around the...
Sandy?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
- This party is so boring, and there are no cute guys here.
I haven' t noticed.
I' m appreciating the art.
I' m not looking for cute guys.
He was not my boyfriend.
It was two months!
Yeah.
I hope he doesn' t have to buy that now.
I think I know that guy.
[Bell Rings]
I' m Polly...
Prince.
We went to junior high or middle school or whatever it' s called together.
Yeah!
No, it' s coming back to me now.
You left before high school.
My mom and I, we moved to Michigan.
Yeah, moved here a few months ago.
So, you know...
Wow.
Yeah, that' s Roxanne.
She does that with, uh, bread, wine bottles and...
Anyway, uh, so what' s your deal?
No, I' m not.
I' m single.
- Oh.
Yeah.
Remember?
Hey, how you doing?
Wow.
Okay.
Croco Tears.
[Laughs]
Yeah.
Excuse us.
What happened to you?
Reuben, I' m in a situation here.
We have to leave now.
No.
Dude, no.
This is serious.
I just sharted.
I don' t know what that means.
I just sharted.
Now let' s go.
You' re the most disgusting person I' ve ever met in my life.
Polly?
Focus for one second, okay?
I' m sorry.
[Chuckles]
So, Sandy, you' re good though?
Yeah.
It' s going incredibly well.
That' s great!
Yeah.
Yeah, you too.
See ya.
All right.
- Be good.
More wine?
Polly Prince.
Seeing her.
Great.
Huh.
She looks good.
Let it rain!
What' s up?
Nice.
Let it rain!
You know, get my life back on track.
Oh, that' s a mistake!
She' s not right for you, dude.
Rain dance!
Hey, you guys want to play some twos?
Actually, we' re kind of in the middle of a conversation, so...
What was that?
I' m just messing with you, sasquatch.
Pick and roll!
Pick and roll!
Outlet!
Sandy, come on.
Sandy!
Sandy!
Raindrop!
Old school!
"T." "T."
I' m burning.
Time- out.
So why do you think Polly' s so wrong for me?
[Panting]
You don' t even know this girl, Reuben.
How different could she be?
I mean, she was a senior delegate at the Model U. N.
She was a "mathlete."
Her yearbook stats are really impressive.
So what?
Mathletes don' t wear body art like that.
Ball in!
I really feel like I ran into Polly for a reason.
I mean, I' m sorry if you don' t agree, Sandy, but I happen to believe in a little thing called destiny.
You know what?
You guys ready to play?
Good shot.
Could I have the ball?
I' d rather not, dude.
I just found out how to cover this man right here, okay?
Come on, let' s play.
Prince with a "P."
And can I get the address as well?
Hello?
[Answering Machine]
No!
I am unable to get to the phone right now, No!
No!
If you' re calling for...
[Laughs]
Yeah, yeah, I do.
Hey, do you live around here too?
No, I don' t.
Hey.
Did you call me last night?
Are you sure?
'Cause I got a hang- up, so I did that star- 69 thingy, and I swore I got your answering machine.
So maybe, I don' t know, the phone lines got crossed or something.
Oh, you doing some shopping?
L...
Gosh.
Hmm.
Wow.
Oh, yeah.
You know, I' m not...
Okay.
Really?
I mean, not that I wouldn' t...
It' d be great to catch up on stuff and all that.
All right, well, how about I' il give you my card.
Here you go.
And on the back I' ve written my home and my cell number, so...
There' s also a fax number.
Right on.
And, um, there' s a pager number too.
Reuben Feffer, senior risk assessment "analysist."
Analyst.
Right.
- All right.
- I' il see you.
Oh.
See you later.
Leland Van Lew' s office.
Hey, Deborah.
Ah, right.
The insurance man.
I' m afraid Leland' s in the hospital.
He got bit while swimming with great whites last week.
Swimming with who?
Great white sharks.
But don' t worry.
[Phone Ringing]
Gladys!
Should I set something up for then?
Could you hang on one second, please?
No worries.
Hi, Reuben.
Oh, hey, Polly!
How' s it going?
Good.
I' m just calling to say that, um, I' m free tomorrow night if you want to get together.
Yeah, I would love to get together.
Should I, um...
Should I pick a restaurant or...
You know what?
I' m...
Did you say you were free?
But okay, I' il talk to you later.
Hello.
Hello.
One, two, three and...?
What' s the buzz Tell me what' s a- happenin '??
What' s the buzz Tell me what' s a- happenin '??
What' s the buzz Tell me what' s a- happenin '??
What' s the buzz Tell me what' s a- happenin '??
Why should you want to know??
Don' t you mind about the future??
Don' t you try to think ahead?
Uh, Sandy??
?
Sandy.!
What?
I' m playing Jesus.
That' s my song.
I know it' s your song, but I felt something, and I decided to go with it.
But you' re playing Judas.
All right, look.
Here' s the deal.
I' m the star of the show, okay?
So if I decide to bust out a solo, do me a favor and give me the freedom to rock out.
So the play' s going well?
Yeah, I think it' s gonna be fun.
I mean, I just wish they wouldn' t surround me with a bunch of amateurs.
Isn' t that like the point of community theater?
Whatever, Reuben.
So I' m going on a date with Polly.
All right!
Where are you taking her?
I don' t know.
Some restaurant in the East Village.
She left the address on my machine.
Well, I had no choice.
She called me, like, seven times... to confirm and then cancel and then confirm again.
What' s wrong with letting her pick the place?
You' ve got irritable bowel syndrome, dude.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
You know, I doubt it' il get this far, but if she turns out to be easier than I thought, there' s something you need to know.
I' m not a virgin, Sandy.
No, not technically, but times have changed since you were last single.
Now, listen, when I' m making out with a girl for the first time,
Nothing violent.
You just tap her real light right on the tushy and say,
"Hey, I' m your daddy.
I' m your daddy. "
Listen to me.
I' m blotting the grease.
That' s the best part.
Listen, don' t be shy.
It' s like saying, "Boop, I' m your daddy."
- I' m not gonna tap her.
Brings' em right back to childhood.
Trust me, they' re putty in your hands after that.
I gotta tell you, I' m really excited about this.
Really.
[Laughs]
Yeah, I actually think it' s not gonna work out, but I' m pulling for you, Reub.
The place didn' t sound ethnic.
Al Hafez.??
[Middle Eastern]
In the late '90s.
I bounced around to a bunch of different places over the past few years.
Oh, God, where?
Let' s see, Austin, Istanbul, Sri Lanka, Portland,
Were you in the Peace Corps?
No, I just like to move a lot.
I kinda get stir- crazy if I' m stuck in one place for too long, you know what I mean?
- Oh, yeah, completely.
You were the person who broke...
Oh, my God!
I can' t believe you remember that.
Oh, of course.
I guess I did manage to pass a few resolutions.
[Laughs]
'Cause you' re sweating pretty profusely.
Yeah, no, I' m fine.
Yeah, but I love it.
I can' t believe you' re not married.
I mean, even when we were kids,
You were always kinda like an old young guy.
Yeah, well, it just hasn' t happened.
But, uh, what about you?
To the whole marriage thing?
No, yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I' m not really big on the whole, um, long- term commitment thing.
Why?
No, I' m kinda coming out of like eight bad relationships.
- Eight?
- You sure I can' t get you a towel or something?
I' m good.
But if the right person came along, things might be different, right?
Oh, yeah.
[Stomach Growling]
- Hey, you mind if I go to the men' s room?
Sure.
Oh, gosh!
Occupied.
I' m gonna be here all night, dude.
Great.
Why don' t you come upstairs and, uh, I' il make you some coffee or tea.
Okay, great.
I just gotta find my keys here.
- [Stomach Growling]
Oh, yeah.
It' s so cozy.
Thanks.
Did you just move in or...
No.
I' ve been here about four months.
Rat!
- Oh, no, no.
He' s a ferret.
I got him in Sicily at a flea market years ago.
He' s old.
Hey, you mind if I use your bathroom?
Oh, actually, that' s not the bathroom.
- My bathroom' s right here.
Yeah, 'cause I just, uh, had a lot to drink, a lot of water.
Ohh!
[Small Fart]
Go!
Oh, no.
I will sit at your feet, and I will serve you for all of eternity.
I' il adopt a Somalian kid, or I' il work in Calcutta, or I' il...
No!
This was fun.
Hmm.
If I' d known your grandmother had embroidered that towel,
Oh, really, you know what, that' s okay.
Okay, well...
Good night, Polly.
Oh, okay.
Oh.
All right.
That' s nice.
Okay, so...
I mean, what should I have done???
Tell her you' re tired and shag ass out of there.
I called her to apologize.
I called her to apologize.
But it doesn' t really matter 'cause I doubt she' il ever want to see me again.
[Elevator Dings]
Mr. Van Lew?
Feffer?
Reuben Feffer.
I recognized you from the Forbes cover.
You' re way early, sport.
Is this the service elevator?
Yeah.
I don' t think we' il have a problem with this insurance business.
Sure, I take chances, but, hey, you can' t build a successful business without the occasional risk.
What I' m trying to determine are the kinds of risks you actually do take.
I only take the calculated ones.
Trust me, I plan on being round for ages yet.
Well, I know we' d really love to give you a policy if we can make it work.
We' il make it work, sport.
So, uh, what are we doing on the roof?
I' m just gonna do a bit of a BASE jump.
Here.
I don' t know what you' re talking about.
A free- fall from an inanimate object.
I always carry me chute in case I find a good launching point.
[Cell Phone Ringing]
All right, look, just don' t do anything, all right?
Hey, Reuben, it' s Polly Prince.
I' il give you a shout when I' m through, all right?
No!
No, that' s not all right.
Polly, can I call you back in a second?
Okay.
I just wanted to tell you I got your message, and you know what?
Let' s just start over and forget about that whole loofah thing.
No.!
Holy shit!
I didn' t like that loofah.
- [Screams]
Leland' s meeting with the insurance guy right now.
[Screaming]
I' il just call you in the next few days.
Leland to Feffer, Leland to Feffer.
Yes, Feffer to Leland, hello?
Come on down and give us a hand.
I think I might have fractured me coccyx.??
You got me a new loofah.
Oh, Reuben, that' s really... thank you... really sweet.
[Laughs]
I don' t believe this!
Oh, what are you doing here?
We' re having an early supper.
Really?
It' s a crime to beat the dinner crowds?
Who is this young woman?
This is Polly Prince.
No!
Polly, it' s so good meeting you.
- I can' t believe you' re eating Indian.
You hate spicy food.
- [No Audible Dialogue]
Psst!
I' m gonna ask this nice Native American man to get us a bigger table.
Need big table, please.
Four people.
Many thanks.
Now, how do you kids know each other?
Mom, we went to middle school together.
We were both delegates in the Model U. N.
Oh, you still work in government, honey?
I' m a waitress.
- She' s also writing a children' s book.
Oh, very nice.
Reu, you' il never guess who I ran into yesterday.
Lisa' s mother.
That' s good.
Hey, Dad, did you try this...
What is this stuff called?
Did you try this?
Apparently, Lisa' s doing wonderfully down there in St. Barts,
- selling villas, happy.
- That' s good for her.
- Now, who' s Lisa?
- Nah.
- Not important.
Oh.
- She left him for another man on their honeymoon.
I think I' il take the check.
- [Sighs]
- What?
Well, you know, your dad seems really nice.
[Chuckles]
Yeah.
I was embarrassed, and I...
I guess' cause I hadn' t seen you for so long and...
I understand.
No, I was an idiot.
I should' ve just told you the truth right from the start.
Reuben, I' m really...
But when did this happen?
Two weeks ago.
Two weeks ago?
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?
Well, it was a pretty big shock.
[Scoffs]
They were still wearing their flippers.
Oh.
[Beeps]
Prince.
Um, I don' t know if you have any plans tonight, but if not, you should swing by, uh, 37 Gansevort Street... around 9: 00 if you can make it.
You know, it' s no big deal, but it could be fun.
So, you know, think about it.
Okay, so, um, I' il see you later... or not.
And...
Oh, if you do come, you should wear comfortable shoes.
But you totally don' t have to.
I mean, I might not even be there.
I wore my comfortable shoes just like you said.
So what are we doing?
Oh, crap.
[Salsa]
It is the best underground salsa club in New York.
I don' t know...
It' s easier than it looks.
There you go.
All right.
Sorry, sorry.
That' s okay.
Just step on my feet a little less than that.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.!
- [Javi Mumbling]
You stop that.
This is my friend Reuben.
- This is Javi.
Hey, you mind if I dance with the beautiful lady?
- All right, thanks, man.
Are you having a bad time?
No, no, no!
I' m just not into this whole dirty dancing thing.
I saw that movie.
I know that' s what you and that, uh, Spaniard were doing.
Wait a minute.
First of all, he' s Cuban, and that wasn' t dirty dancing, that was just salsa.
Okay, it' s just I' m just really, truthfully not the kind of guy... that' s ever gonna be into these kind of clubs or any...
Okay, Reuben, you know, then tell me, what kind of guy are ya?
What do you mean?
Well, up until now, you haven' t exactly been the portrait of honesty, so just come clean, okay?
Just tell me who you are.
I hate spicy food.
Yeah, I don' t like it at all.
I have a mild case of I. B. S. And...
What?
Irritable bowel syndrome.
Oh, God.
That' s terrible.
Look, the thing is,
I assess risk for a living, so I know that I have a. 013% chance... of being hit by a car on my way home, or a one in 46, 000 chance of falling through a subway grate.
Really?
So I try to manage that risk by avoiding danger... and having a plan and knowing what my next move is, and I guess you don' t exactly live your life that way.
Yeah, which is great.
But I' m not gonna ever be a dirty dancer, and I don' t eat food with my hands, and I really like you, but I just don' t think this is gonna work out.
Funny.
[Woman Vocalizing]
Gettin' down with the sounds around??
I don' t...
'Cause it felt like you just swatted me.
No, no, you...
I have a little crick in my wrist.
Do you hear that?
You hear that?
Well, I got it out.
Yeah.
[Salsa]
Oh, man.
Oh, yeah.
You can' t be done yet.
Come on, Reuben, focus.
You have to last at least five minutes here.
Four minutes, 27, 26, 25.
Two minutes 20, 19, 18, 17.
Oh, God!
Fifty!
[Giggles]
Yeah, 50!
Whoo!
I tell ya, I think I might end up marrying this woman.
After one night?
Did you spank her?
Yeah, I tried, but I don' t think she liked it.
Yeah, some women find it offensive.
Iceman!
I did not sleep with him out of charity.
You weren' t interested till you found out his wife boned some other guy on their honeymoon.
That' s not it.
He is a kind, decent, solid guy.
I' ve never been with anybody like that.
Hi.
Do you have to use the word "bone" every time?
I use it when it' s appropriate.
Have you ever heard of a guy shouting out "50" when he orgasmed?
Yeah?
Okay, so throw pillows go in this cabinet here.
No, no, they' re... decorative.
- What do you mean?
You' re the only one who sees them, but you don' t sleep on them.
Then you take them off the bed every night, put 'em in a box, take them out of the box.
I don' t know.
I mean, Lisa thought they looked nice.
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They make the bed look nice.
Hey!
I' m liberating you.
Try it.
I' m not gonna...
Come on.
Come on!
This is ridiculous.
It' s not ridiculous.
It' s not like driving a knife into a pillow is suddenly gonna make me feel...
Yeah!
You' re right.
Bigger one.
What is the point of these things really?
They' re stupid.
Ha!
Ha!
Not anymore.
You know how many minutes a day...
I spend getting throw pillows on and off the bed?
Four minutes in the morning, four minutes at night.
I figured it out.
It' s 56 minutes a week.
That' s nearly two days of my life a year I spent putting pillows on and off a stupid bed!
Whoa!
You hit mattress.
You know what?
What' s wrong?
No, they' re just not where I left them before.
Hey, why don' t you use that key finder I bought you?
I think it could help.
Need the stupid key finder!
Anyway, I was thinking I' d come meet you.
I thought you hated dirty dancing clubs.
It' il be fun.
Nothing.
It' s the key finder, isn' t it?
No, it' s so not the key finder.
It is not the key finder.
Bye.
Yes, it...
Oh!
How???
[Man Singing In Spanish]
Doin 'all right.
Actually, me no estás too good, Javier.
I want you to stay away from Polly, all right?
Find yourself another dance partner.
- Why?
Yeah, we' re dating.
And I' m not gonna let some big shot salsa king... sweep in with your mambo moves and your Erik Estrada look... and come in and try to take her away, because I' ve had that happen before and it' s not gonna happen again.
- Hey, I don' t care what you...
I' m homosexual.
My boyfriend Hector, he plays the keyboards in the house band.
Oh.
[Salsa]
It' s just...
You know, like this one:
"The Boy with a Nub for an Arm."
Well, that one has a moral.
You know, to teach kids they gotta be careful when they' re playing with fireworks.
No, and- and I think it' s brilliant, by the way.
Uh- huh.
I mean, like, you really convey... the pain and the fear, and I love the little doggy too.
And I don' t mean this in a bad way.
Just what were you thinking?
[Salsa]
"Leland Van Lew."
That is supposed to be so much fun.
That should be on the rewards side.
It' s one of the most dangerous activities a human being can do.
Yeah.
Have I parachuted off the top of a building?
Uh- huh.
No.
So how do you know what it' s like?
I don' t.
Interesting.
Yeah?
I actually like this.
Yeah, it' s good.
[Vomiting Loudly]
You know, I was thinking maybe we can just sit and talk.
I' m not really a big raquetball player.
We' il just get up a bit of a sweat.
- [Yelling]
- [Screams]
So I' ve been running the numbers, and I gotta say... things aren' t looking too good from our end.
Bollocks!
[Groans]
Geez!
It' s the heli- skiing, [Yells]
Volcano luging, shark diving.
Bottom line is, unless you drastically alter your lifestyle, we won' t be able to insure you.
Reuben, I came to you for a reason.
I was told that you had more imagination... than any of the other blokes in the big firms... that you analyze the man and not just the numbers.
I guess I was wrong.
Of course I am.
But I wanna hold onto me company.
[Yells]
I' m gonna be in Nantucket at the end of the month.
Aboard the what?
I' il take you for a bit of a sail, give you a chance to really get to know me.
And I guarantee you by the end of the weekend, you' il know what a safe bet I really am.
Uh, you' re bleeding pretty bad.
Yeah, I think I' ve swallowed a tooth or something.
Got it.
Your serve.??
So I tell Leland we can' t insure him.
He responds by inviting me up to Nantucket for some Death Ray Sailing Challenge.
Yeah.
I' ve never been to Nantucket.
You wanna come?
Is that rude?
Okay, good.
So you' re actually gonna commit to something in advance.
Yeah...
Oh, my God.
I think that would be really fun.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doin '?
I' m- I' m gonna have some nuts.
No.
Everybody knows that.
Okay.
Let' s say, uh, conservatively, I don' t know, 17 people eat these nuts on a given night.
If they' ve been here for even two weeks, we' re talking about... 238 people who dipped their dirty hands into that bowl.
Why are their hands dirty?
On average, only one out of every six people wash their hands when they go to the bathroom.
[Gasps]
Yeah, so when you think you' re innocently eating a little bar snack, you' re actually ingesting potentially deadly bacteria from about 39 soil- handed strangers.
I mean, people wonder why they get E. Coli poisoning or salmonella or hepatitis, when all they gotta do is look at the snack bowl at their local watering hole.
No.
It' s an absolute hot zone in there.
L- l- l- I mean, I made such a compelling argument.
Thank you.
You never know.
??
[Salsa]
I don' t care that you... that you don' t know how to dance.
Hey, Javi.
You ready?
Uh- huh.
What is happening?
- [Shouts In Spanish]
[Singing In Spanish]
- What are you doing?
Holy shit.!
I' m back.
Who' s this?
- You have a girlfriend?
- I' m not your girlfriend.
I mean, we' rejust kind of...
Hi, I' m Polly.
[Polly]
I don' t want you to go.
I don' t want you to go.
I' m just gonna...
You gotta talk about it.
I' m just gonna go.
L- I was for a few weeks.
But then all he ever talked about was scuba diving.
- Really?
I missed you too, but...
I mean, come on!
What was I supposed to do?
- What, with that Polly person?
She doesn' t even call herself your girlfriend.
No.
She just doesn' t like the phrasing.
Then let mejust ask you this.
Are you really gonna spend the rest of your life with her?
I don' t know, Lisa.
Because I' m ready to do that with you, Reuben.
I made a mistake and I took you for granted, but I promise you that I will never, ever hurt you again.
I love you, Reuben.
I think you should, um, go stay with your parents, okay,
Where are you going?
I' m going into the house, remember?
The house that I bought for us to live in.
Let' s go move into our house.
No, we can' t just go...
No.
I can' t...
Okay.
[Polly]
I wouldn' t be seeing you if I was planning...
She came back.
Hello?
I' m- I' m still working on Van Lew.
I thought you decided on Van Lew two weeks ago.
Polly, can you hang on a second?
No, I kinda have to go.
You better not be bonus hunting on me, Reuben.
Bonus hunting?
I owe it to him to give him a thorough analysis.
All right.
I' m going to Barbados with my mistress for the weekend.
I want this Van Lew thing settled by the time I get back.
All right?
Good things.
Oh, damn!
Hey, pal.
Lisa dropped this off for you.
Oh.
Thanks.
[Reuben' s Voice]
I met a real estate agent named Lisa Kramer... who showed me an apartment, which I rentedjust so she' d go out with me.
Yeah, not good enough.
She' s a killer.!
Hey, hey, hey, hey?
I' m almost finished.
Polly' s career prospects.
Risky.
She' s writing a children' s book where kids get maimed.
Yeah, see, I think her lack of career is actually a positive,
'cause she' d have more time to spend with the kids.
You' re skewing the numbers in Polly' s favor, Reuben.
Why are we even doing this?
Because I' m confused, Sandy.
I mean, my goddamn wife shows up on my doorstep... wanting to get back together, Polly' s freaking out.
I just wanna make sure I' m making the right decision.
[Moans]
I don' t see how putting these two girls in the Riskmaster' s gonna help you make up your mind.
Interesting.
Polly.
Polly?
No way.
You should just cut your losses and get back with Lisa.
Nah, I checked it, like, three times.
The program says she' s the safer choice.
Whatever.
By the way, dude, is your health okay?
I mean, you' re looking kind of thin.
Uh, no.
Polly' s been making me eat ethnic food, so I' ve been throwing up a lot lately.
Polly Prince.
Polly Feffer.
Come on.
I thought you were so excited to go.
Polly.
We fell in love with these funny little Bolivian mud huts.
- Hold on.
- So we had our designer use a similar color palette in here.
I' m on the phone.
Would you just please keep it...
So, also, you know what else?
It' s like I feel weird going away for the weekend when your wife' s just come back into town.
I don' t know why you' re making this into such a big deal.
I told you I' m not getting back together with her.
Okay.
All right.
Bye.
Okay, bye.
Uh- huh?
Hey, Leland!
Are those storm clouds up ahead?
We might just get a light dusting, that' s all.
[Thunderclap]
Are you sure you' re all right?
I' il be out in a sec.
All right.
Oh, God.??
[Fanfare]
So I know we haven' t been seeing each other that long, but I really feel like it' s time we take things to the next level, and I' d like you to consider moving in with me.
Why don' t we just move in together?
Oh, yeah.
We' re gonna have ourselves a tussle.
Oh, my God.
Did you pack him, or did you... did you...
What- What is this?
I mean, why am I in your computer... on your Riskmaster thingy and...
Okay, you know what?
Well, no, it' s fascinating.
I learned a lot about myself.
I' ve learned that I have no career, I' m flaky, I like ethnic food.
Lisa came back, and I, you know, I' ve been trying to figure things out.
What are you figuring out, Reuben?
Future?
What are you talking about?
What future?
Come on.
What, did you think we were gonna get married?
Whoa!
I was gonna ask you to move in with me first.
You expect me to move to the suburbs with you?
Reuben, are you insane?
People do that all the time.
They have kids, they- they- they make plans, they get married, they buy houses.
You know what, though?
That' s what you do.
Is your lack of a plan that different than my plan?
I don' t have a plan.
You' re on the non- plan plan.
I am not on a non- plan plan!
You are too!
I' ve never met anybody more afraid of committing to anything.
I mean, you were a senior delegate at the Model U. N., Polly.
[Leland]
Wahoo!
I' ve been living my life, okay?
I' ve been in good relationships and I' ve been in shitty ones, and I' ve moved a lot, and I' ve been happy and I' ve been sad, and I' ve been lonely, and that' s what I' ve been doing, which is a lot more than I can say for some freak who thinks... he' s gonna get the Ebola virus from a bowl of mixed nuts.
It' s common sense!
Oh, trust me, that is so far beyond common sense, Reuben.
You don' t understand what I grew up with.
Okay, well, big deal, Reuben.
- What?
- Yeah, on Long Island.
A wife and kids and a golden retriever.
Whatever.
I' m, uh, glad I saw that.
'Cause you know what?
I' m gonna make this really, uh, easy for you, Reuben.
I have no interest... in getting married and moving to the suburbs.
So here' s what I think your new plan should be.
I think you should get back together with Lisa, move into your house, and move on with your life.
And- And, uh, I think you guys will be really happy together.
Whoa!
Weather report said sunny skies.
Leave me a message, or call back, or not.
You know, whatever.
Hey, Polly, it' s me.
Listen, um,
I would like to talk to you, all right?
'Cause I feel really bad about what happened, and...
?
Baby, you' re a lost?
Baby, you' re a lost?
[Ringing]
Baby, you' re a lost cause?
Hey.
So, how' s the house?
The house is, uh... it' s great.
Well, I can' t wait to see it.
Hey, did you get the gift I sent you?
Thanks.
I really wanna see you, Reuben.
Let me think about it.?
Fighting for a lost cause??
Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats.
The premiere ofJesus Christ Superstar is about to begin.
Hey!
Javi!
What are you doin 'here?
No, my friend Sandy Lyle is in the show.
Hey, have you, um... have you talked to Polly?
She was upset, bro.
Must' ve been some kind of fight, huh?
I keep calling her up, and she won' t pick up the phone.
I don' t know, I was thinking about maybe dropping by tomorrow.
What?
W- Why?
I don' t know.
Hi.
I' m sorry I' m late.
Oh, no.
Hi.
Hi.
Hey, Javi, this is Lisa, my... wife.
??
I' m not promising anything.
It' s very exciting.
[Cell Phone Ringing]
The meeting with Van Lew' s board and the AFLAC people' s moved to 4: 00.
4: 00?
Get your ass over here!
[Over P. A.]
Good evening, folks.
Uh, I' m Sandy Lyle, and I' ve got a very special announcement.
In addition to playing the role ofJudas,
[Man]
It' s cool.
Give me your crown, okay, Wonsuk?
Screw you, Sandy.!
You' re a has- been.
No one even cares you were in that stupid movie.
- Oh, shit!
[All Gasping]
[Wonsuk]
Judas is biting me.!
What just happened in there?
I am a professional, Reuben, and I' m not gonna put my reputation on the line for a group of freaking amateurs.
It' s always the same story with you, huh, pal?
You did this one movie a hundred years ago.
From then on, you thought you were better than everybody else.
Move on with your life.
It' s not about what happened in the past... or what you think might happen in the future.
It' s about the ride, for Christ' s sake.
There' s no point going through all this crap... if you' re not gonna enjoy the ride.
And you know what?
When you least expect it, something great might come along... something better than you even planned for.
You were funny as hell playing those bagpipes, though.
Did I ever tell you that?
L- I don' t think I' ve ever heard you speak before, Mr. Feffer.
No, Lisa.
I' m not getting back together with you.
What are you talking about?
You screwed a scuba diving instructor on our honeymoon.
I mean, what kind of cold, heartless bitch... would do that to someone they love?
I' d have to be an idiot to get back together with you after that.
Oh, and by the way, I destroyed all your little throw pillows.
They serve no purpose.
They' re purely decorative.
Dude, that was incredible.
Whatever you do, don' t ever take my advice again.
Your dad totally put it in perspective for me.
I was barely famous back then, and I' m never gonna be famous again.
The E!
What do you mean?
I hired Dustin and Vic myself.
And I was gonna try and sell it to the network when I' m done.
True Hollywood Story on yourself?
That' s the stupidest thing I' ve ever heard.
I' m such a loser.
Reuben, I' m your wingman.
Whatever it is, I will not let you down.
Your Reuben' s proxy?
What the hell does that mean?
Now, he' s dealing with a personal situation, so he asked me to fill in.
Now, you gotta relax.
I' m a professional actor, and these dudes will never know the difference.
I can' t freaking believe this is happening.
Be quiet, 'cause I' m... tryin' to prepare.
I' m gonna vomit.
I am so sorry for the delay, folks, but one of our senior analysts, Reuben Feffer, had his spleen burst just a few moments ago, and...
Well, God willing, Leland.
But anyway, be that as it may, we have Mr. Feffer' s associate here, Mr. Sanford Lyle, who' s been briefed on the case and will present Reuben' s recommendations.
[Clearing Throat Loudly]
Um, let me see here.
[Clearing Throat Loudly]
And he' s, uh, at a decent weight, and he looks pretty damn healthy, right?
And he' s a sexy guy, right?
And he is sexually active in the community.
On paper, Van Lew is one of the riskiest sons ofbitches alive.
But, people, we cannot sum up a man' s life with a bunch of numbers on a computer screen.
All right, we all need to look into our hearts and go,
"Do I think this dude is gonna die in a few years or not?"
Is old Leland here gonna fight off a man... with the last name "Reaper," first name... who goes by the last name "Reaper," first name "Grim"?
Or will this BASE- jumping, crocodile- wrestling, shark- diving, volcano- luging, bear- fighting, snake- wrangling, motocross- racing bastard die?
And the answer is no, friends, which is why myself,
Reuben Feffer, Stan... and all of us here at Indurby and Friends... are willing to lay our asses on the line... and proudly recommend that Leland Van Lew... receive fifty million dollars in life and health... and automobile insurance... for a duration of no less than 20 years.
Are you that kid from Crocodile Tears?
You' re goddamn right I am.
Yeah!
Bloody ripper!
Congratulations.
Love ya, son.!
I don' t think you really wanna leave here.
You have no idea what I want.
Does that mean anything to you?
Look, I made a mistake, all right?
I should' ve never put you in the Riskmaster.
Yes.
That' s why it' s not gonna work out between us.
Reuben, you are a nice, safe, conventional guy.
It' s not gonna work out.
I don' t think that' s who I really am.
That' s okay.
What do I have to do to prove it to you?
Hey!
Huh?
Oh, my God.
Look, I' m eating nuts.
- What the hell are you doing?
Hey.
Oh!
But I couldn' t have gone through all that...
Maybe you were right.
But if you get on that plane and you go to Cincinnati... or Tanzania or wherever you' re going, we' il never know if it could' ve been something more.
No, no, no.
N- No.
Oh, God.
I don' t wanna get married.
I just wanna take you to dinner... sometime this week.
Hello.
I want to come have a meet...
Oh, my stars and stripe.
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe it is you.
Hi, Polly.
I am Claude.
So how' s it goin '?
In truth, uh, it has been a little bit tough noogies for me.
Lisa, she... she broke my heart.
Well, you have to be like the hippo.
Exactly.
Like the hippo.
You are here on honeymoon again?
This is your beautiful bride?
We' re just hangin 'out.
Well, yeah.
- No, definitely not married.
But it' s possible.
We' re takin' things step by step, seein' how they work out.
Okay, I don' t really understand what you are talking about, but, uh, any chance you are for scuba today?
- No way, Jose!
- Yes way, Jose!
But we' re goin 'out with that guy.
Hey, Leland.!
We' il be out there in a minute.!
As long as you are for scuba, Leuban, I am happy.
Sweet.
So, au revoir, my good friend.
Thank you for everything, Claude.
It' s good to see you again.
Nice to meet you, Claude.
You as well.
So you ready?
Let' s do it.?
Let my love open the door??
I think he' s a funny guy.
He' s original, he' s hilarious, he' s a superstar, and I have two tickets for me and my baby to go see him.
Gonna be a great show.
As he says, there' s black folks and there' s niggers.
I think he' s a very progressive black man.
I think he' s true with everything he says.
He hits home, I mean, all his jokes are on point and you know exactly what he' s talking about.
DC, are you ready?
DC, are you ready?
Give it up for my brother, the one, the only,
Chris Rockl
Thank you!
Yes.
Welcome.
Sit yo asses down.
Sit yo black asses down, man.
Thank you all for coming out to my fourth HBO Special.
That' s right, baby.
Number four!
Yeah!
Yeah, this is the Kill Bill one, you know what I' m saying?
Gonna do it right, man.
It' s good to be here in Washington, DC.
Lovely Constitution Hall, that' s right, man.
Now I haven' t toured in a long time,
I haven' t done a special for a long time.
I was waiting for special things to happen, and a lot' s happened in my life since the last time I was on the road, man.
I had a little baby girl.
It' s not a big deal.
I mean, even roaches have kids, right?
But I got a little baby girl.
And it' s amazing when you have a girl - you' re a man and you have a girl, it' s eye- opening.
Cos I realise I' m the man in her life.
And my relationship with my daughter is gonna affect her relationship with men for the rest of her life.
And every man in here has dated a woman with some daddy issues.
That shit ain' t fun, OK?
She giving you a hard time over some shit her daddy did in 1969, OK?
That shit ain' t never fun.
Sometimes I' m walking with my daughter, talking to my daughter,
I' m looking at her in her stroller, and sometimes I pick her up and stare at her and I realise my only job in life... is to keep her off the pole.
Keep my baby off the pole!
They don' t grade fathers but if your daughter' s a stripper, you fucked up.
You went mighty wrong there, baby.
You thought you had a household?
No, you got a ho camp.
I' m not making fun of the strippers cos some of these girls were abused.
Some of them just missed a few hugs.
Some of them were like, "Daddy, can we talk?"
"Hey, I' m watching the game."
"I' il show you!
"I' m gonna dance naked to Mötley Crüe records.
"I' m gonna change my name to Cinder Buns
"and I' m gonna wear clear heels."
When did that happen?
Was there a big old ho convention and all the hoes got together and said,
"We need something new.
"Something that just says' nasty '."
One girl said, "I got it!
Clear heels! "
"Ooh, girl, you disgusting.
You all right. "
I got nothing against strippers.
Somebody' s gotta do it.
Somebody has to take on the monumental responsibility that the strippers do.
Somebody' s gotta do it, somebody has to entertain the married men of America.
Somebody has to do it.
Your wife, you know, your wife will take care of you but she ain' t gonna entertain you.
Give your wife clear heels - "What the fuck is this shit?
"Get this ho shit out my house.
"Now wash your hands so you can eat."
I got nothing against the strippers.
But the strip clubs are very addictive.
Not to me but to other people.
They are addictive.
Every guy in here got a friend that' s addicted to strip clubs.
Addicted.
You know those guys that cannot function in a normal club.
You take 'em to a normal club, they ask one girl to dance -
"Would you like to dance?"
"Maybe later."
"Yo, man, let' s go to the titty bar.
"Man, these bitches is stuck up, man.
"I gave this bitch a dollar, she didn' t do nothing."
We all got those friends that' s addicted to strip clubs.
You know those guys that go to the strip club in the daytime?
If you at a strip club and the sun is out, you got some problems.
You know those guys that eat at the strip club?
Eat at the buffet.
How the fuck could you eat at a nasty- ass strip club?
What?
Are you that hungry?
Motherfucker, go to Mickey D' s or some shit.
Rwandan refugees won' t eat that shit.
At a damn strip club.
Titties and Tater Tots don' t mix.
I got nothing against strippers.
What I got a problem with is the stripper myth.
You know the stripper myth.
There' s a stripper myth that' s being perpetuated throughout society.
The stripper myth is, "I' m stripping to pay my tuition."
No, you' re not.
There' s no strippers at college.
There' s no clear heels in biology.
I didn' t know they had a college that only took one- dollar bills.
And if they got so many strippers at college, how come I never got a smart lap dance?
I never got a girl that sat on my lap and said, "If I was you, I would diversify my portfolio."
"You know, ever since the end of the Cold War, I find NATO obsolete."
Now, I' m 39 years old, 39 years old.
Yep.
Some people are like, "Really?" Yeah.
New Jack City' s a long time ago.
Now, I' m 39, right?
And I still love rap music, I love rap music.
You know, I love it!
You know, I' m 39, I' m that age, I' ve been loving rap music forever.
As I get older, I realise I' m gonna love rap music when I' m 80.
Whatever music was playing when you started getting laid, you gonna love that music for the rest of your life.
So I' m always gonna have a soft spot for Whodini, you know what I mean?
Now I love rap music but I' m tired of defending it.
You gotta defend rap music cos people always go, "That' s not music, that' s not art.
How can you listen to that trash? "
In the old days, it was easy to defend rap music.
It was easy to defend it on an intellectual level.
You could break it down intellectually why Grandmaster Flash was art, why Run DMC was art, why Whodini was art, and music.
You could break it down intellectually, OK?
And I love all the rappers today but it' s hard to defend this shit.
It' s hard, man, it' s hard to defend "I got hoes in different area codes".
On an intellectual level.
It' s hard to defend "Move, bitch, get out the way".
Well, as you can see, there' s a bitch in his way.
Now he needs to move.
Thus the term, "Move, bitch, get out the way".
You need to open yo eyes so you can get the bitches out of yo way.
My favourite song right now is impossible to defend.
It' s impossible.
We should all be ashamed of ourself for liking this fucking song.
Lil Jon.
You know that shit.
To the window!
To the wall!
To the sweat drip from my balls!
To the sweat drip from my balls!
Skeet!
Skeet!
Skeet!
Skeet!
You go to a club, you see girls dance to that shit.
To the sweat drip from my balls!
To the sweat!
To the sweat drip from my balls!
My balls!
I feel sorry for the guys that gotta pick a wife out of this bunch.
"Daddy, where d' you meet Mommy?"
"She was singing about balls at a club."
That' s why people always say rap music is misogynistic and it' s degrading to women.
But what I realise, man, is women that like rap don' t give a fuck.
Women that like rap don' t care what they saying.
If the beat' s all right she will dance all night.
Women don' t give a fuck.
The nastier the better.
I see girls on the floor dancing to the nastiest shit ever made.
Just on the floor, like - Smack her with a dick.
I' il put a dick in the ear, a dick in the ear.
Fuck her in the eye.
Blind the bitch.
And you know what' s wild?
If you mention to a woman that the song is disgusting and misogynistic, they all give you the same answer -
"He ain' t talkin '' bout me."
Smack her with a dick.
I' il put a dick in the ear.
He said your name!
Smack her with a dick.
Love rap music, tired of defending it, man.
It' s weird with rap music because people either love it or hate it.
Even the United States Government hates rap.
The Government hates rap.
You know why I say that?
Cos they don' t arrest anybody that kills rappers.
They don' t got no clues, no suspects.
They don' t have shit when it' s a dead rapper.
They don' t fill out a police report.
They don' t even have a chalk line for a dead rapper.
The cops just piss around the body.
Smack her with a dick.
If you wanna get away with murder, just shoot somebody in the head and put a demo tape in they pocket.
"This is a rap killing, let' s get outta here."
The Government hates rap.
Look at all the rappers, all the dead rappers.
I' m gonna list these motherfuckers, man.
Biggie Smalls, man.
Biggie Smalls gunned down outside a party in Los Angeles.
Now Biggie weighed about 400 pounds.
So they had to shoot him for a while.
There was some reloading in that drive- by.
It' s like the bullet had to hit another bullet that went in before it... just to really do damage.
They don' t got no clues, no suspects, a hamburger wrapper, nothing!
Jam Master Jay, man.
Jay, man, I miss Jay.
I miss that man.
Gunned down in a recording studio in Queens, OK?
They had surveillance footage of people coming in and out, they ain' t arrested nobody.
It' s like the guy came in the studio, shot Jay, recorded an album, then left.
They ain' t get nobody.
No clues, no suspects, not a Odor- Eater, nothing!
Tupac Shakur, man.
Tupac was gunned down on the Las Vegas Strip after a Mike Tyson fight.
Now how many witnesses do you need to see some shit before you arrest somebody?
Shit.
More people saw Tupac get shot than the last episode of Seinfeld.
Every year, Tupac comes back from the dead, records a new album with clues in it...
Every record got a clue if you listen real hard.
"The brother in the red shot me dead."
Right there!
Track four!
Pac is trying to tell us something.
Listen again!
"It was a nigger named Kevin." Right there!
Pac is reaching out to us.
Listen!
The Government hates rap, man.
And only rappers get gunned down like this.
I' il tell you right now, if Billy Joel, Elton John and David Bowie got shot, they' d have Bruce Springsteen' s house surrounded.
The Government hates rap.
Only the good rappers are dead, only the good ones.
Biggie dead, Tupac dead,
Vanilla Ice still alive.
The Government hates rap.
You mean to tell me they can find Saddam Hussein in a fucking hole but you can' t tell me who shot Tupac?
Shit.
They found Saddam Hussein in fucking Iraq.
Tupac got shot in Vegas!
In fucking Vegas!
Not on no side street, the motherfucker got shot on the Strip!
In front of Circus Circus!
Damn.
It' s all fucked up, the whole world' s fucked up, man.
Michael Jackson lost his mind.
What the hell is wrong with Michael?
Another kid?
I thought it was Groundhog' s Day when I heard that shit.
Another kid?
Get the fuck out of here.
That' s how much we love Michael.
We love Michael so much, we let the first kid slide.
Hey, man, the man made Billie Jean, leave him alone.
Another kid?
I' m done with Michael!
I was a fan my whole life,
I am fucking done, I am handing in my glove, OK.
I saw Michael on 60 Minutes.
Ed Bradley tried his best to make Michael look like a mammal.
Or somebody that drank water and breathed air, right?
He gave Michael the easiest questions in the world, the easiest GED questions in the world, and Michael could not pass the test.
It' s like, "Uh, Michael,
"do you think it' s proper for a 45- year- old man
"to sleep in a bed with 13- year- old boys?"
"Yes!"
"OK, let me rephrase that.
"Would you let your children sleep in the bed of a 45- year- old man
"that' s been accused of child molestation?"
"Yes!"
Ed Bradley looked at Michael Jackson like he wanted to say,
"Nigger, is you crazy?"
Like he wanted to take the 60 Minutes clock and push the shit forward, say, "Get the fuck off my show."
"I thought you said it was 60 minutes."
"It' s ten minutes, get outta here.
"Ya nutty nigger, what the fuck is wrong wit 'you?"
I' m done with Michael, man.
You see Michael go to court 20 minutes late.
What kind of black man gonna come to court 20 minutes late?
This ain' t Barbershop 2.
Shit.
He don' t even wear a real suit to court, coming in there looking like Cap' n Crunch.
Shit, who' s your lawyer?
Franken Berry?
Better take your black ass to Banana Republic and get you a decent suit.
What the fuck is wrong with that boy?
I' m done with Michael.
Another kid?
That' s like another dead white girl showing up at OJ' s house.
And OJ going, "I know what you' re thinking..."
Michael Jackson going to jail.
It' s gonna be a sad sight when Michael Jackson goes to jail.
Oh, we gonna shed a tear when Michael Jackson go to jail.
It ain' t even gonna be sad the day he go in.
It' s gonna be sad like a month later when that perm grows out of his hair.
The shit' s all nappy and grey.
When his make- up' s all fucked up cos he don' t get the Crayola people to fix his face no more.
That' s a fucking sad- ass sight.
Remember we used to have arguments about who was better, Michael Jackson or Prince?
Prince won.
Yeah, man, Michael went crazy, then Janet lost her damn mind, whipping out her titty on a Sunday afternoon.
On a Sunday afternoon!
What the fuck is wrong with this girl?
It' s the Super Bowl!
A titty on a Sunday afternoon.
People coming home from church, turn on the TV.
"Oh, Lord!"
A titty on a Sunday afternoon.
And a 40- year- old titty at that.
You can' t just whip out a 40- year- old titty.
That' s yo man' s titty.
That is yo man' s titty.
40- year- old titty - yo man' s titty.
20- year- old titty - community titty.
That' s for all to see.
The titty couldn' t even believe it was outside.
It was like, "Oh, shit, what the fuck' s going on?
"Close the door!"
Michael' s crazy, Janet lost her mind, now I gotta see Jermaine every week for the blow- by- blow.
I thought I was done with Jermaine.
I got the Do What You Did When You Did What To Me album.
I thought I was done with Jermaine.
Jermaine looked crazier than Michael.
What the fuck is up with Jermaine?
Is it me or is Jermaine the greasiest nigger you ever seen in your life?
My God, man!
Does he spray Armor All on his face or some shit?
Just greasy motherfucker, my God.
Just glistening like Patrick Ewing in the fourth quarter.
Just slimy.
Just greasy, shiny motherfucker, my God.
When Jermaine' s on the TV, I gotta wipe the grease off the screen.
I can' t see shit -
Jermaine must have been on.
The police can' t even capture his ass cos he just slips out.
Please! "
Jacksons lost they mind, R Kelly lost his mind and shit.
What the fuck is wrong with R Kelly?
He got a lot of balls, OK?
Talk about, "It ain' t me!"
Got a damn sex tape out.
"It ain' t me."
Motherfucker, we know what you look like.
That' s you, OK?
There' s a damn Soul Train award right next to the bed!
Best R & B '98, that' s you!
I can' t even believe R Kelly would come outside after this shit.
At one point on the tape, R Kelly' s eating this girl' s ass out like it' s Puppy Chow.
He' s in her ass like he' s got diabetes and her ass got insulin in it.
Lookin 'like the movie 28 Days Later.
R fucking Kelly, man.
The whole world' s going crazy, man.
Siegfried and Roy, the tiger bit the man in the head, and everybody' s mad at the tiger.
Talk about the tiger went crazy.
That tiger ain' t go crazy, that tiger went tiger!
You know when the tiger went crazy?
When the tiger was riding round on a little bike with a Hitler helmet on.
"Oh, shit, I' m a crazy tiger.
"Oh, Lord, I' m crazy.
What is I gon 'do? "
Whole damn country' s all fucked up.
We so desperate for entertainment everybody' s falling for this magician, David Blaine.
What the fuck is this shit?
Are we so desperate that we fall for a trickless magician?
Where the fuck' s the trick?
Cut a lady in half!
Pull a rabbit out a hat!
Do something.
What' s his last trick?
"I' m in a box...
"and I ain' t gonna eat.
"I' m in a box and I ain' t gonna eat."
That ain' t no trick, that' s called living in the projects.
Shit, man.
Kobe Bryant lost his mind.
What the fuck is Kobe thinking?
What is on Kobe' s mind going to Colorado, around all these white people, and not bringing Johnnie Cochran?
You gotta bring Johnnie to that shit.
The girl' s still alive, Johnnie' il knock this out in two weeks.
"Is she breathing?"
"Don' t worry about it."
What the fuck?
Some people are like, "If you hire Johnnie Cochran you look guilty."
Yeah, but you go home.
What, you wanna look innocent in jail?
I' d rather look guilty at the mall.
Kobe might go to jail, you never know.
A lot of people, "Oh, Kobe ain' t gonna go to jail cos Kobe' s cute and cuddly.
"No, he' s cute and cuddly, he' s positive."
Yeah, Kobe looks cute and cuddly on TV cos when you see him he' s standing next to Shaq.
But in real life Kobe' s like 6' 9 ", 6' 10".
Shit, when he get to court, he gonna scare the shit out of them white people.
They gonna look at him like he' s a big old black praying mantis.
He gonna sit down at the witness stand, his knees gonna be up here.
Put his hand on the Bible, it covers up the whole Bible.
She looked nice.
She got a nice pantsuit on, got her hair in pigtails.
Yeah, she ain' t gonna have on no clear heels now, no.
She got on some comfortable flats.
And some thick- ass stockings.
The thickest fucking stockings you ever seen in your life.
You gonna think she broke her leg, that' s how thick them stockings is.
She gonna come in the court like this.
"Your Honour, my stockings are fucking thick."
A lot of people say, "Well, this is what Kobe gets for cheating.
That' s what he gets. "
I know some of you...
OK, fuck it, I' m sure most of you women been cheated on before.
Some of y' all are with the guy that cheated on you right now.
And the guys are like, "Would you shut the fuck up?"
"Do some old shit, 'toss my salad', one of them."
Men are just low, ladies.
Some women are like, "If I lost weight, he wouldn' t cheat.
"If I was more beautiful, he wouldn' t cheat."
Yes, he would.
There ain' t nothing you can do, ladies.
The only thing you can do to stop your man cheating...
The women are like this...
Only thing you can do... is be there.
Where?
There.
Wherever he' s thinking about fucking her.
Just be right there.
And even then he still might lose yo ass.
"Hey, honey, look, a sale!
Let me go fuck this bitch right now. "
No.
The beauty don' t matter.
Kobe cheated on his wife and Kobe' s wife is fine.
My God!
That' s a fuckin 'señorita out this motherfucker.
A hot tamale out this motherfucker.
I would trade my wife and two aunts for Kobe' s, man.
I' il throw in a cousin and my momma if I have to.
Come on, Momma, we got to close this deal.
Don' t let all this celebrity news fool you right now.
That' s all it is.
It' s a trick to get yo mind off the war.
I think Bush sent that girl to Kobe' s room.
Bush sent that girl to Kobe' s room, Bush sent that little boy to Michael Jackson' s house,
Bush killed Laci Peterson.
Bush was fucking Paris Hilton in that video.
All to get yo mind off the war.
Bush lied to me, they all lied to me.
"We gotta go to Iraq cos they the most dangerous country on earth.
"They the most dangerous regime in the world."
If they so dangerous, how come it only took two weeks to take over the whole fucking country?
Shit.
Man, you couldn' t take over Baltimore in two weeks.
Get the fuck outta here.
Looking for weapons of mass destruction.
Can' t even find a Wiffle ball bat.
Give me something, shit!
Attack, motherfucker.
Let me get a fucking paper cut over that motherfucker.
Nothing!
Not a damn thing.
"Weapons of mass destruction."
They got whatshisname, they got Saddam Hussein, that' s cool.
I was a little sad when they got Saddam.
That' s kinda like the Coyote catching the Roadrunner.
I guess Acme finally made some shit that worked.
I didn' t even know we was after Saddam, I thought we was after Bin Laden.
What the fuck happened?
I thought we was after Bin Laden.
When did Bin Laden give Hussein the baton of hate?
When did he pass it on?
"They hate me, they hate me...
"they hate you!
Run! "
"Oh, shit."
Shit, man, when I heard we was after Hussein, I was like, "Really?"
That' s so '80s.
The whole war seemed like a bad VH1 special.
Hussein' s back and Bush is back and Cheney' s back and Paula Abdul' s back.
Shit, before you know it, it' il be Hammer time again.
Stop.
Hammer time.
No, when the war started, it was great.
Patriotism' s beautiful.
But slowly but surely, the patriotism turned into hate- riotism.
When the war started, it was great.
People had their flags up.
People screaming out "USA!" for no reason.
You go to a baseball game, a football game, a basketball game, people are, "USA!"
I' m like, "Hey, calm down.
"That' s got a little German on it, don' t you think?"
You know, people start freaking out.
People got it...
At first the war was cool.
People got into this whole hate the French thing.
I don' t understand that shit.
"Fuck France, man.
They don' t wanna help us out.
"Don' t eat no French fries.
Fuck the French, man.
Cos they wouldn' t help us out in the war.
The United States is the biggest, most powerful country in the world.
Why the fuck would anybody help us in the war?
Would you help Mike Tyson beat up Urkel?
Don' t make no sense!
But people started freaking out.
The war was weird.
On TV you' d see these weird white guys.
Nobody here, you guys are OK.
See these weird white guys getting overly patriotic and they have their fucking flag hats on and their flag drawers and their flag pick- ups.
"I' m American, man, I' m American.
"Fuck all these fucking foreigners.
I' m American! "
You' re like, "Hey, calm the fuck down."
There was a lot of accepted racism when the war started.
"I' m American.
Fuck all these foreigners. "
And that was cool.
Then it was, "I' m American.
Fuck the French. "
That was cool.
"I' m American.
Fuck all these Arabs. "
And that was cool.
Then they went to,
"I' m American.
Fuck all these illegal aliens. "
Then I started listening.
Cos I know niggers and Jews is next.
It' s like, any day now!
That train' s never late!
And people started screaming they was American.
A lot of white people scream they American as if they got something to do with the country being the way it is.
Like they was on the Mayflower or some shit.
When you break it down, there ain' t even that many Americans in this room, contributing Americans.
God bless all the veterans.
Big up to the veterans.
I can' t say nothing wrong about the veterans.
OK?
You American.
Now if you swam here from some shitty country that didn' t allow you Bubblicious, you too are American cos you overcame obstacles and made sacrifices to actually get here.
You are a true American, OK?
Don' t let nobody tell you no different.
Everybody else, you' re just lucky.
You' re just lucky.
All you crazy white people, "I' m American!"
That' s it.
You think you' re better than somebody from France cos you came out of a pussy in Detroit?
The whole country' s got a fucked up mentality, man.
We all got a gang mentality.
Republicans are fucking idiots, the Democrats are fucking idiots, conservatives are idiots and liberals are idiots.
Anyone that makes up they mind before they hear the issue is a fucking fool, OK?
Everybody...
No, everybody' s so busy wanting to be down with a gang -
"I' m a conservative, I' m a liberal." It' s bullshit.
Be a fucking person.
Listen.
Let it swirl around yo head.
Then form yo opinion.
No normal, decent person is one thing, OK?
I got some shit I' m conservative about, I got some shit I' m liberal about.
Crime, I' m conservative.
Prostitution, I' m liberal.
And they keep trying to scare us.
Everybody' s trying to scare us.
Telling us to be on the lookout for al- Qaeda.
Like, "Where?"
I ain' t scared of al- Qaeda.
I' m from Brooklyn, I don' t give a fuck about al- Qaeda.
Motherfucking al- Qaeda.
Shit, did al- Qaeda blow up the building in Oklahoma?
No.
Did al- Qaeda put anthrax in your mail?
No.
Did al- Qaeda drag James Byrd down the street till his eyeballs popped out of his fucking head?
I ain' t scared of al- Qaeda, I' m scared of Al Cracker.
Gotta look out for Cracker Al.
He' s a dangerous motherfucker!
But American people, whenever you leave...
I love my country, but whenever you leave, you find out people really hate America.
It' s good sometimes.
Cos we got so much shit, OK?
America' s the only country in the world where people go hunting on a full stomach.
It' s beautiful.
That' s how good we got it.
America' s a great country.
But here' s the thing, people hate America cos we can' t make up our mind what we wanna be.
America does good things, America does bad things, America does schizophrenic things.
One cool thing America does, that I love, is we feed other countries.
It' s beautiful that we feed other countries.
Yes, it is!
But we only feed them when they' re starving.
Why can' t we feed them when they' re hungry?
They didn' t just wake up with flies around their lips and bellies out to here.
It took a while for shit to get that bad.
And our government' s like, "Nah, wait for the flies.
"Two more weeks.
Wait for the flies.
Come on, more flies! "
And we send them food.
Do we send them the good shit?
What do we send them?
Grain.
Anybody here have grain today?
Anybody going to McGrainies after the show?
Why can' t we send them the good shit?
Why can' t we send some Cheez Doodles, some Funyuns, some Twinkies?
Why can' t we just pour some gravy on the people?
There you go.
Drink up.
Have some gravy.
People going, "I love America!
"It' s raining gravy!"
Shit, give them a Whopper, it' s only 99 cents.
Shit, we call ourselves humanitarians, meanwhile we' re dropping 50- pound sacks on 40- pound people.
But I love America, man.
We got a lot of freedom in America.
For instance, abortion' s legal.
It' s beautiful that abortion' s legal, man.
I love going to abortion rallies to pick up women.
Cos you know they' il fuck you.
You ain' t gonna find a bunch of virgins at the abortion rally.
You might even see some clear heels!
"What you doing here, girl?"
"Fucked up again."
The abortion issue, it' s a woman' s issue.
A woman gets pregnant, she don' t wanna hear shit from the man.
"Fuck you, I don' t need you, motherfuck you."
Unless she decides to have the baby.
Then she' s like, "Where' s my cheque?"
When a woman gets pregnant, it' s a choice between the woman and her girlfriends.
A woman gets pregnant, her and her girlfriends get together, and they have a little abortion tribunal, and they vote on the baby like it' s Survivor.
Each girlfriend puts in her two cents.
One goes, "Child, you should have that baby.
"That man got some good hair, it' s wavy, it' s wavy."
The other girlfriend goes, "Why are we talking about this?
"Ain' t we going to Cancun next week?
Get rid of that baby! "
And that' s how life is decided in America.
Now, fellas, if you get a woman pregnant, you' re only allowed to say two things.
You can' t even suggest abortion.
If you say, "A", you fucked up.
You can' t even suggest abortion.
You don' t wanna suggest abortion.
If you suggest abortion and then she has the baby, when that kid' s about five, six years old, he gonna be cursing yo ass out.
How you doing? "
"I' m alive, that' s how the fuck I' m doing!
"You wanted me dead, huh, bitch?
"I' m alive, motherfucker.
"I should bust a cap in yo ass."
You don' t need that drama.
So do not suggest abortion.
Now, fellas, if you get a woman pregnant, you only got two things to say.
Two ways to try it on.
Now, the first thing you can say is, "Wow, I can' t believe you' re pregnant.
"I' m so happy.
I can' t wait for you to have this baby.
I love you so much. "
I' il try it again.
"Wow, I can' t believe that you' re pregnant.
"I' m so happy.
I can' t wait to have this baby.
"I love you so much."
That' s cool.
Now, if you don' t wanna say that, you got one more choice.
A woman walks in the room, tells you that she' s pregnant, you look her dead in the eye and you say...
"So what you gonna do?"
Good, it ain' t just me.
One thing I don' t like about America is we got real bad drug policy.
Horrible drug policy.
We got people in jail for getting high.
For getting high, man.
That' s fucked up, man.
The Government says drugs are illegal because we' re trying to protect society.
But they don' t give a fuck about yo safety, they sell guns at Wal- Mart, they don' t give a fuck about you.
No, the Government' s like this - they don' t want you to use your drugs, they want you to use their drugs.
So every night on TV you see a weird- ass drug commercial trying to get you hooked on some legal shit.
And they just keep naming symptoms till they get one that you fucking got, OK?
It' s like, "Are you sad?
Are you lonely?
You got athlete' s foot?
"Are you hot?
Are you cold?
You want this pill, huh, motherfucker.
"You got to take this pill."
They don' t even tell you what the pill does.
You see a lady on a horse or a man in the tub.
And they just keep naming symptoms.
"Are you depressed?
Are you lonely?
Do your teeth hurt? "What the fuck?
I saw a commercial the other day that said, "Do you go to bed at night
"and wake up in the morning?"
Shit they got one.
I got that.
I' m sick, I need that pill.
The Government trying to get you hooked on some legal fucking shit.
And that' s the truth, man.
The reason coke and weed are illegal in America don' t got shit to do with yo safety.
The reason that coke and weed are illegal in America is cos the best coke and weed ain' t made in America.
If they made the good shit here, there' d be a coke and weed restaurant on every fucking corner.
Wouldn' t be no Starbucks, it' d be Weedbucks.
McDonald' s, McCokeald' s.
Uh, get me a Happy Meal and an eight- ball, thank you.
Krispy Kreme, Kracky Kreme.
That' s how good Krispy Kreme doughnuts are.
Krispy Kreme doughnuts are so good, if I told you they had crack in it, you' d go, "I knew something was up.
"I knew.
These doughnuts are too damn good, man.
"Got me knockin 'on the doughnut window at two in the morning.
"Come on, man, open up, man.
"Give me one more doughnut!
I' il do anything!
"I' il suck your dick!"
That should be the new slogan for Krispy Kreme.
Krispy Kreme - so good you' il suck a dick.
These are some good- ass doughnuts.
You' d be mad if your kid ate your doughnuts.
"You know what I had to do to get them doughnuts?
Leave them alone!
"Now I gotta go out and suck some more dick for doughnuts.
"Kids will never learn, shit."
No, man, the Government, they will never legalise drugs in America.
That' s first of all.
For bullshit.
The second reason the Government will never legalise drugs in America is because, God forbid, some brown people got wealthy.
Can' t have that.
Cos drugs come from brown countries.
We can' t have wealthy brown people.
There are no wealthy black - or brown - people in America.
We got some rich ones, we don' t got no fucking wealth.
People go, "What' s the difference?"
Here' s the difference.
Shaq is rich.
The white man that signs his cheque is wealthy.
"Here you go, Shaq.
Go buy yourself a bouncing car.
"Bling- bling!"
I' m not talking 'bout rich, I' m talking' bout wealth, OK?
Those rich motherfuckers.
Those rich bastards.
I ain' t talking 'bout Oprah, I' m talking' bout Bill Gates, OK?
If Bill Gates woke up tomorrow with Oprah' s money he' d jump out a fucking window.
"Ah, shit.
"I can' t even put gas in my plane."
I' m not talking 'bout rich, I' m talking' bout wealth.
Cos wealth will set us fucking free, OK?
Cos wealth is empowering.
Wealth can uplift communities from poverty, OK?
A white man gets wealthy, he builds Wal- Marts and makes other white people have some motherfucking money.
A brother gets rich, he buys some motherfucking jewellery, OK?
Do you know what the fuck I' m talking 'bout?
I ain' t talking 'bout rich, I' m talking' bout wealth.
Wealth is passed down from generation to generation.
You can' t get rid of wealth.
Rich is some shit you can lose with a crazy summer and a drug habit.
Fuck, Rick James was rich.
One minute you' re singing Super Freak, the next you' re doing Old Navy commercials.
"Give it to me, baby!
Give me corduroy! "
Not talking 'bout rich, I' m talking' bout wealth.
Don' t get me wrong, it' s not all white people' s fault that black and brown people don' t have any fucking wealth.
Maybe - now just maybe - maybe if we didn' t spend all our money on rims we might have some... to invest.
We don' t give a fuck, boy.
Black people, we love rims.
We will put shiny- ass rims on any piece of shit car in the world.
We don' t give a fuck.
A brother would put rims on a toaster if you' d let him.
"Yo, man, I got some raisin toast sittin 'on 22s.
"22s!
Look at the motherfuckers, look at 'em!
"And they spinnin ', look at they spinnin'!
"They spinnin ', look at they spinnin'!"
We don' t give a fuck.
Money' s new to black people.
We the most money- wasting motherfuckers on the face of the earth.
We spend money like we think the shit' s gonna rot.
Brothers riding around with TVs in the headrests of the car.
The TVs is on and ain' t nobody in the back seat.
I ain' t talking 'bout rich, I' m talking' bout wealth.
Now, when it comes to acquiring a fortune, when it comes to acquiring wealth in the United States of America, different people have gone about it in different ways.
There' s a saying about wealth, there' s a saying about fortunes, and the saying is, "Behind every great fortune there' s a great crime."
And some of the richest, most powerful people in the United States are the descendants of drug dealers.
Kennedys, Brockmans, it' s all drug money.
They call it bootlegging but that' s just a white word that means drug dealing.
They didn' t sell boots, they sold the crack of their day, OK?
They killed cops and kids, and that' s cool, good for them.
Now... when it' s time for other people to come up and acquire wealth the rules change.
One of the number one rules when it comes to acquiring wealth goes like this.
The rule is, only the white man can profit from pain.
Only the white man can profit from pain.
So if you' re black or brown, you can make money and prosper and get rich in America.
But whatever you decide to do, it better be positive.
Cos if one person is harmed, you will be destroyed, OK?
Every now and then Oprah has a show where she' s just giving away money.
You know why?
She' s trying to keep the Feds off her back.
Only the white man can profit from pain, OK?
White man makes alcohol, tastes great, I love it, you love it, we all love it.
Kills motherfuckers every single day, OK?
Some of y' all ain' t even gonna make it home tonight cos of alcohol.
Driving home, "That Chris Rock sure is funny.
"Oh, shit!"
But it' s all right cos it' s all white.
White man makes cigarettes.
Cigarettes are the most dangerous product known to man.
Kills motherfuckers every fucking day.
Cigarettes are so dangerous, it kills motherfuckers that don' t smoke!
That' s right.
First- hand smoke, second- hand smoke, people talking into machines.
"Hey, what' s up, man?
"I love cigarettes.
This shit is good. "
But it' s all right cos it' s all white.
Shit, could you imagine if the Philip Morris family was a bunch of jheri- curled niggers from Mississippi.
Do you know how illegal a pack of cigarettes would be?
You would get 60 years for a pack of Newports.
That' s right.
White man makes guns, nobody gives a fuck.
White man makes guns, kids shoot up each other in schools, nobody gives a fuck.
White man makes guns, no problem.
Black rapper says "gun",
Congressional hearing.
Like, "My God, that nigger said gun!
"And he rhymed it with fun!"
And that' s why people hate America... the hypocrisy of our democracy, OK?
That' s why they hate America.
But let me tell you right now, the number one reason people hate America, the number one reason, is because of our religion.
Americans worship money.
We worship money.
Separate God from school, separate God from work, separate God from Government, but on your money it says, "In God we trust".
All my life I' ve been looking for God and he' s right in my pocket.
Americans worship money.
And we all go to the same church - the church of ATM.
Everywhere you look, there' s a new branch popping up, reminding you about how much money you got or how much money you don' t got.
And if you got less than $20, the machine won' t even talk to you.
The machine' s like, "You better go see a teller."
You ever go to a teller and try to take out $8. 50?
It' s disgusting.
Man, you gotta wait on that long- ass line.
People doing real transactions in front of you.
You get up to the fucking front, fill out your form.
Eight- fifty.
The fucking teller looks at it, she looks at you, she looks at the chit.
She don' t even take the money out the drawer, she take it out her pocket.
"Wastin 'my time.
Get the fuck outta here, shit. "
I think every bank should have a box of ones by the door for they broke- ass customers.
I don' t need free checking, I need lunch money.
Trying to buy me some pork fried rice, man.
Here' s the other thing, man.
Drugs are illegal but ATM machines are open 24 hours a day.
24 hours a day.
For who?
Who the fuck is it open for?
Have you ever taken out $300 at four o' clock in the morning for something positive?
I think a psychiatrist should pop up on the screen and go, "Come on, man.
"Save your money, man.
"Don' t buy drugs, buy some rims."
"They spinnin ', look at they spinnin'!
They spinnin '!
"They spinnin ', look at they spinnin'!"
Americans worship money.
Shit, you know why banks are closed on Sunday?
Cos if they wasn' t church' d be empty.
I love America.
I got to say, America is the greatest country in the world, OK?
It' s the greatest country in the world.
In the whole world.
It' s the best place.
There' s no place I' d rather be or be from.
And we are all lucky to be here.
Everybody in this room, lucky to be here.
Even black people, lucky to be here.
But if you black, you gotta look at America a little different.
If you black, America' s like the uncle that paid your way through college but molested you.
You gotta forgive.
What' s the biggest issue in America right now?
The most divisive issue in America is affirmative action.
A lot of people think it' s to do with the '60s, the back of the bus, separate lunch counters.
When you see footage of the '60s, see black people, see us getting sprayed down, dogs getting sicked on us, little girls getting burnt up in churches, that' s just white people being nice.
Nicer than they was in the '50s,' 40s, and '30s.
Shit, there' s black people that died in the '30s that was looking down from heaven in the' 60s going, "Man, them niggers got it good."
No, affirmative action was put into place to offset policies that the United States Government implemented during slavery that affect us today.
When I talk about slavery, I' m just talking about a period of time where black people had no rights.
So you' re talking about the 1600s to about 1964.
You know, give or take a year, depending on when yo town decided to act right.
People go, "What happened during slavery that could affect us today?"
A lot of shit happened during slavery that affects us every day.
For instance, during slavery, they used to take the biggest, strongest slaves and breed them and try their best to make big, strong super- slaves, OK?
And there' s evidence of that today.
Like the NFL, for instance.
NFL stands for Nigger Fucking Large.
They bred the slaves, and this is why black people dominate every physical activity in the United States of America.
We' re only 10%% of the population, we' re 90%% of the Final Four, OK?
We fucking dominate all this shit, OK?
Basketball, baseball, football, boxing, track, even golf and tennis.
As soon as they make a heated hockey rink, we gonna take that shit too.
Motherfuck Wayne Gretzky.
Wait till you see Lebron on some skates.
You ain' t seen shit yet.
He just gonna have one skate, chilling, "What' s up?"
He ain' t gonna have a stick.
He gonna smack the puck with his dick.
Slapshot bi- atch!
So that' s what they did to the big, strong slaves.
And you know what they did to the smart ones?
They killed them.
That' s what they did.
That' s right.
That was the policy of the United States Government, to kill smart black people.
That' s right.
So the real smart motherfuckers had to hide the fact that they were smart.
The law of the land was, if you read, you die.
If you read, fucking die, OK?
So you know what that means?
The first black drug dealers didn' t even sell drugs.
They sold books.
"Yo, man, I got two pages, man, got two pages, man, check it out, man.
"Yo, man, I got a word, check it out, man, I got a new word.
"I got a new word, man.
It' s new, man, it' s new, man. "
So think about the poor slaves that could read but had to hide it.
Think about the poor slaves that could read but was scared to teach they kids to read for fear they' d be killing they kids.
Think about the poor slave who used to drive the buggy into town every day.
He' s driving the buggy - and he could read.
And up ahead he sees a real busy intersection.
He' s driving the buggy.
And then he sees a stop sign.
Now he' s got a real dilemma.
"Oh, Lor," what is I gon 'do?
"Oh, Lor, what is I gon 'do?
"OK, if I go across this intersection,
"I' m- a have a accident.
"If I stop at this sign, these crackers' il kill me.
"Oh, Lor, what is I gon 'do?"
And he don' t know.
And he' s riding the buggy.
He says, "Fuck it," and goes through the intersection.
He has a big old accident, wipes out.
Wipes out, almost kills somebody.
And the police come.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
"You could' ve killed somebody, nigger.
You see that stop sign? "
"I don' t know what you talking 'bout, sir."
"Nigger, you see that stop sign right there?"
"Do you mean that octagon thing?
"Nigger, who taught you octagon?"
Don' t get me wrong with affirmative action.
I don' t think I should get a job over a white person if I get a lower mark in a test.
I don' t think I should get accepted into a school over a white person if I get a lower mark.
But if there' s a tie, fuck 'em.
Shit, you had a 400- year head start, motherfucker.
White man, you gonna be all right.
"you won' t need affirmative action, if you strive to be the smartest and the brightest."
They say that as if the country is run by the smartest and the brightest.
I was in black schools and white schools so you can' t tell me shit.
When you go to a class, there are 30 kids.
Five smart, five dumb, and the rest are in the middle.
And that' s all America is - a nation in the middle.
A nation of B and C students, that' s all the fuck it is.
But let' s keep it fucking real, OK?
A black C student can' t run no fucking company.
A black C student can' t even be the manager of Burger King.
Meanwhile, the white C student just happens to be the President of the United States of America.
Other people got they problems right now in America.
What' s the other big issue in America right now?
Should gays be allowed to marry?
The beautiful thing about the gay marriage issue is it' s the absolute only issue the President will answer.
The President don' t give a fuck, he will give you a straight answer on gay marriage.
"Mr President, when' s the war gonna end?"
"Well, we' re talking to people, we' re looking for stuff, it' s out there,
"you never know how it' s gonna end."
"Mr President, when' s the economy gonna pick up?"
"Well, we' re talking to people,
"and economic indicators indicate that indications are coming to the indicator."
"Mr President, what about gay marriage?"
"Fuck them faggots."
Damn, that' s some harsh shit.
People always say, we can' t have gay marriage cos marriage is a sacred institution that happens in the church.
No, it' s not.
Marriage ain' t sacred.
Not in America.
Not in the country that watches Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire?
And The Bachelorette and Who Wants To Marry A Midget?
Get the fuck outta here.
Gay people got a right to be as miserable as everybody else.
Get the fuck outta here.
How fucking sacred is that shit?
But I' m married.
It' s a beautiful thing, man.
And I don' t cheat.
No.
Not because I' m a great husband, just cos I' m tired of getting caught.
Gotta put the girls in the mistress protection programme.
From now on your name is Carol.
If anybody calls you Lisa, ignore 'em.
OK, Lisa?
"OK."
Bitch, you gonna get us killed!
The fuck is wrong with you?
You won' t last five minutes on the streets.
Now I don' t cheat, man.
Another big reason I don' t cheat is cos I never meet any girls that wanna fuck me.
I' m just not that celebrity.
I don' t bring it out of them.
Women see Denzel Washington, they go, "I' m gonna fuck him."
They start kicking off shoes soon as they see his ass.
Women see me, occasionally they wanna fuck me, but when women wanna fuck me, they get real practical about it.
They go, "You know what?
I bet you if I fucked Chris Rock,
"I could get him to pay my Visa bill."
I have paid so many college loans in my day.
I have put more girls through school than the United Negro College Fund.
Shit, I should' ve had my own dorm at Howard.
"And this is the Chris Rock Cafeteria.
"Chris loves sloppy joes!"
Yes, I' m married, and bored out of my fucking mind.
But it' s a beautiful thing, a beautiful thing.
If you' re in a good relationship, chances are you' re bored out of your fucking mind.
All good relationships are boring.
The only exciting relationships are bad ones.
You never know what' s gonna happen tomorrow in a bad relationship.
You never know when you' re gonna walk in and go, "Hey, you gave me crabs!"
That' s exciting.
I wonder what tomorrow' s gonna bring.
And those are the choices you got in life.
You can be married and bored or single and lonely.
Ain' t no happiness nowhere.
Married and bored or single and lonely.
That' s right.
Marriage is some boring- ass shit.
Once you get married, you gotta hang around other married people and that' s just disgusting.
You ever go to dinner with six neutered adults?
A bunch of women talking about Diaper Genies and hair colouring.
"You know, if you leave it in too long it stings."
Shut the fuck up.
A bunch of men talking about barbecue grills and routes to work.
"Sometimes I take the highway but if it' s backed up, I got some side streets
Check it out.
"L- 95 is clear sometimes..." Shut the fuck up!
I hate married people.
It' s fucking disgusting.
If you go to eat dinner with single people, single people eat for an hour and 30 minutes and leave, cos they got fucking to do.
Married people close down a restaurant.
They start ordering coffee and dessert.
Start talking to the architect.
"I like the thing you put right there."
Start talking to the cook.
"What' s in the tea?"
"Water, bitch!
"Hurry up, we got a lot of not fucking to do.
"If you hurry up, we can not fuck all night."
I hate married fucking people, man.
You become a fucking pet.
Cos women like to get they husbands together that don' t even know each other, and have like a grown man play date.
Put you in a room with some other married motherfucker and go, "He likes baseball just like you."
And you' re in some room with some fucking stranger going, "I like baseball."
Yeah. "
"Yeah, baseball, good."
"Yeah."
"Honey, who the fuck is this?
"Get me the fuck out of here, I don' t need no new friends.
"If you wanna help me out, introduce me to a girl."
I hate married people, man.
Whenever I go out with other married couples, I like to bring a single crackhead.
Just to spicen up the activities.
Come on, tell us some of your cracky tales, please.
Married and bored, single and lonely.
The problem with relationships, people want too much.
Everybody' s looking for a soul mate.
"We' re soul mates, we' re one, we' re soul mates.
"I' m a Pisces, he' s Aquarius, we' re perfect.
We' re soul mates, it' s incredible.
"His moon is my star and it' s a soul mate.
"We complete each other and finish each other' s sentences.
"The other day I said, 'Honey, it' s gonna rain,' and he said rain too!
"It' s amazing!
It' s like we' re telekinesic, we' re telekinesic.
"It' s incredible, my God."
Nobody gets a soul mate.
It don' t happen.
Nobody.
Not even James Brown, the godfather of soul, he don' t even get a soul mate, as we all saw a couple of weeks ago.
James Brown looking like Nick Nolte.
Like, he put the good foot in her ass.
Nobody gets a soul mate.
All you gonna get in life if you lucky is a mate.
Just a mate.
Somebody you fuck, go to movies with.
You fuck, go to another movie.
You fuck, go to a comedy show.
You fuck, go to your grandmomma' s house.
You fuck, go to your momma' s house.
You fuck, go see another movie.
Somewhere in between fucking and movies, he goes, "Wanna get something to eat?"
That' s all relationships are, they ain' t that complicated.
It' s fucking and eating.
If you don' t like fucking somebody and you don' t like eating with them, y' all don' t need to be together.
And the longer you' re with somebody, it' s more eating and less fucking.
You don' t remember the last time you fucked but you know you had rice and beans on Wednesday.
You' re never gonna get a soul mate, the perfect person.
You' re never gonna meet somebody that loves Seinfeld and the Wu Tang Clan.
It ain' t happening.
Even if you meet the perfect person, it ain' t gonna be the perfect time.
You' re married, they' re single.
You' re Jewish, they' re Palestinian.
You' re Mexican, they' re a raccoon.
You' re a black woman, he' s a black man.
There' s always a obstacle in the way.
You' re never gonna meet the perfect person, it' s never gonna happen, OK?
Every now and then, God likes to play practical jokes on people.
God will send you on a double date with the perfect couple.
You ever been out with the perfect couple?
Ever made the mistake of going on a double date with a couple that' s actually in love?
You in the middle of your bullshit relationship.
And you sit down with two people that' s in love.
You can' t even eat your food cos you can' t believe what the fuck you are witnessing.
You got a fork in your hand, you' re like, "Oh, shit.
"He' s really listening to what she' s got to say.
"They really like being around each other.
"Man, we can' t hang with them no more.
They gonna break us up! "
"Can' t let these happy motherfuckers fuck up my life.
No way! "
See, the thing is, men, we are ill- prepared when it comes to relationships.
That' s right.
You would think by now women would rule the world.
You would think women would rule the world.
But they don' t!
They don' t.
You know why?
Cos women hate women.
Women hate women.
You do.
You get any two girlfriends in this room, been girlfriends for 25 years, you put a man in between them, "Fuck that bitch."
Women hate women.
Guys are not like that.
Guys actually think there' s other fish in the sea.
I gotta get me a girl like that. "
If a woman introduces her new man to her girlfriend, when they walk away, her girlfriend goes,
"I gotta get him.
"And I will slit that bitch' s throat to do it."
Shit, every woman in here got a girlfriend they don' t trust around they man.
A good girlfriend too.
"I' il go shopping with her
"but I ain' t gonna leave that bitch with my man for five minutes."
I remember one time, one time I was in a restaurant, me, my wife, her girlfriend.
My wife said, "I' m going to the bathroom."
I say, "OK, I' il see you when you get back."
She said, "No, you coming with me."
And she made me come with her.
And she did the right thing cos I' d have fucked the girl.
I' d have fucked her on the quesadilla, I don' t give a fuck.
Nah, man.
But one thing I learned, man, once you get married, fellas, women wanna be responsible for all your happiness.
You got that?
All of it.
Fellas, you ever have your woman catch you jerking off?
Ever have your woman catch you jerking off?
Did she get mad at you, even though she wasn' t thinking about fucking you?
Here' s the real deal, she ain' t mad you was jerking off.
She' s mad you was making yourself happy.
"How dare you make yourself fucking happy?
"I' m in charge of happiness in this house.
You' il be miserable till I fucking say so.
"Take your hands out yo pockets!"
Another thing with women, one thing about women, women hate for you to expect anything.
Don' t expect shit.
A woman can cook for you every day for five years.
Every day food is on the table, every day at 7: 49, every day.
The day you come home, there ain' t no food, and you ask nicely, "Honey, where' s the food?"
"What am I, your fuckin 'maid?
"You need to learn how to cook for yourself, you stupid motherfucker."
So, fellas, in order to avoid this, what you gotta do is act super- nice every time she does anything.
No matter how little it is, make a big deal out of it.
If she pour you some water, you gotta go, "Wow, water!
You' re incredible!
You' re so smart! "
She fucking folds a napkin.
"Wow, look at that!
You' re incredible. "
You gotta treat 'em like retarded kids, OK?
That' s right.
Married and bored, single and lonely.
That' s right, guys.
Here' s the thing - when you' re married, you wanna kill your spouse.
When you' re single, you wanna kill yourself.
Better her than me.
Anybody in this room that' s ever been in love will testify to this shit.
If you haven' t contemplated murder, you ain' t been in love.
If you haven' t seriously thought about killing the motherfucker, you ain' t been in love.
If you haven' t had a can of rat poison in your hand and looked at it for 45 minutes straight, you ain' t been in love.
If you haven' t bought a shovel and a bag and a rug to roll they ass up in, you ain' t been in love.
If you haven' t practised your alibi in front of the mirror... you ain' t been in love.
The only thing that stopped you from killing this motherfucker was an episode of CSl.
Man, they thorough.
I' d better make up, they might catch my ass.
See, relationships are hard.
But in order for any relationship to work, both people have to be on the same page.
Both people have to have the same focus.
And we all know what that page is, what that focus is.
In order for the relationship to work, both people have to have the same focus, and the focus is all about her.
It' s all about her.
She' s already there, fellas, she' s waiting for you to come aboard.
Fellas, when you wake up in the morning, you should look yourself in the mirror and say, "Fuck you.
"Fuck your hopes, fuck your dreams, fuck your plans,
"fuck everything you thought this life was gonna bring you.
"Now let' s go out there and try and make this bitch happy."
Yes.
It' s all about her, fellas.
Say yes to everything.
Everything.
Everything you can afford, say yes to.
Just say yes.
Before she even gets it out of her fucking mouth.
"Honey, can..." Yes.
"Honey, I..." Yes.
Just get a stamp.
Yes.
Another thing, fellas - don' t argue.
You cannot win.
You cannot beat a woman in an argument, it' s impossible.
You will not win, cos men, we are handicapped when it comes to arguing cos we have a need to make sense.
Women ain' t gonna let a little thing like sense fuck up they argument.
Cos she not in it for sense, she' s in it for distance and irritation.
"How long can I talk before this motherfucker snaps?"
They want you to shake the shit out of them till you hear the cops coming.
"Motherfucker, I' m serious!
"Oh, shit, let me get the fuck outta here."
And like I said, try your best to make her happy.
Try your best.
But here' s one thing nobody tells you.
You can' t make a woman happy.
It' s impossible.
I' ve never met a happy woman in my life.
Women are always complaining about something.
Women like to complain, women save up shit to complain about.
"He don' t even know I know but I' m gonna get his ass on that shit next month."
They like fucking complaining.
They love it.
No matter what you do, she' il be mad.
You can fuck a woman with a diamond dick and make her come ten times, she' il still complain.
"Why' d you make me come so hard?
"This diamond dick is cloudy.
"Why didn' t you go to Tiffany' s?
You' re so fucking cheap. "
No matter what you do, your woman is mad at you.
If you work all the time, "Why you work all the time?
You ain' t never home.
"You always leavin 'me.
I hate this shit. "
If you home all the time, "Why you all up under me?
"Let me get some fucking room to breathe.
"Damn, stop sweatin 'me.
I hate this shit. "
If you make more money than her.
"Fuck you.
I wanna make decisions too.
"You ain' t my fucking daddy, I don' t need you to take care of me.
"I hate this shit."
If she makes more money than you,
"You broke motherfucker.
"You never have no fucking money.
Fuck this shit.
"I don' t wanna make all these decisions.
I need to be taken care of.
"I hate this shit.
I can' t take it. "
And the number one reason your woman' s always mad, fellas, the number one reason your woman is pissed the fuck off... cos you ain' t her first choice.
Fellas, you ever catch your woman just looking at you but not saying nothing?
In her mind, she' s thinking, "How did I end up with this ugly motherfucker?
"Lord, this motherfucker' s ugly and stupid.
"I had a good man and I blew it.
"Damn, Lord, kill my man.
Kill him, please.
"Kill him while I still look good enough to get something new.
Strike him!
"If you out there, Lord, strike this motherfucker dead."
Nothing gets you ready for marriage, man.
Nobody.
Nothing gets you ready for marriage.
Nobody tells you that once you get married, you will never fuck again.
If you like fucking, marriage ain' t for you.
Shit, I haven' t fucked in seven years.
I' ve had intercourse.
Intercourse is when she gets out of the shower on the nice sheets.
Fucking' s in the back of a rental car when your woman' s going, "Come on, get some!"
Nobody gets you ready for that shit.
Nobody tells you that once you get married, you will never get pussy again.
If you like pussy, marriage ain' t for you.
I haven' t had pussy in seven years.
I' ve had vagina.
I hate vagina.
I came out of a vagina.
As soon as I got out, I said, "Man, I got to get me some pussy."
See, they don' t prepare you.
They don' t tell you married women don' t have pussies.
Married women have vaginas.
If you go to a wedding and the woman' s throwing the bouquet, she ain' t throwing the bouquet, she' s throwing the pussy.
"I won' t be needin 'this no more."
And the woman that catches it is gonna get married cos now she got two pussies.
You gotta marry the two- pussy girl.
But it ain' t just men that lose out on marriage.
Women, you lose out too.
Women, once you get married, he will never lick your pussy again.
Pussy, vagina, whatever the fuck you wanna call it.
He will never lick it again.
I see some married women with tears in they eyes right now.
He will never lick your pussy again.
Forever ever.
"Forever ever?" Forever ever.
He will never lick your pussy again.
Don' t get me wrong, he' il give it one coat.
But he ain' t gonna put the finish on it like he used to.
He used to put a spit- shine on your pussy.
You had to put on shades just to look at your pussy.
Put a little sticker next to your pussy -
"objects in pussy may appear closer than they actually are."
Nobody gets you ready for this shit.
That' s right, fellas, once you get married, no more blow jobs.
If you like blow jobs, marriage ain' t for you.
I haven' t had a blow job in seven years.
I' ve had fellatio.
When you' re single, you get the best blow jobs in the world, 8, 12, 15 minutes straight
like she' s going for her scuba licence.
You get married, every married man I know gets the same lazy- ass blow job.
It' s like three licks.
"Is it hard?
I gotta fold these clothes. "
What kind of lazy- ass blow job is this shit?
If we was at a restaurant I would send it back.
Waiter, this blow job ain' t ready yet.
Marriage is real fucking tough.
Marriage is so tough, Nelson Mandela got a divorce.
Nelson Mandela got a fucking divorce.
Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in a South African prison, got beaten and tortured every day for 27 years, and did it with no fucking problems.
Made to do hard labour in 100- degree South African heat for 27 years, and did it with no problems.
He got out of jail, after 27 years of torture, spent six months with his wife and said,
"I can' t take this shit no more!"
I' m outta here.
Y' all take care.
Thank you!
Best show ever.
It was hilarious.
Once you get married, life is over.
No more blow jobs!
I' m telling you, don' t get married.
I' il come and see him again.
My dimples hurt, I laughed so hard.
See?
I just pissed on myself.
What a great show!
That was great.
I really enjoyed it, it was wonderful.
Great show.
English
I was lucky.
I came from the most beautiful place on Earth...... where music was everywhere.
And people believed there was no difference...... between being awake and dreaming.
My dream was always clear.
For as long as I could remember, I wanted to be a musician.
That' s my mother.
She' s the one who taught me how to sing.
That' s me.
Whenever I heard her voice, all I wanted was to be held in her arms...... so I could be closer to the source of the magic.
When my mother suddenly died...... I felt like everything around me had died too.
I couldn' t feel anything anymore.
The only thing that kept me going were the letters from Uncle Alfonso.
He' d gone to Los Angeles and made it big in the restaurant business.
He said the streets really were paved with gold if you worked hard enough.
I didn' t know what to do, so I asked my grandfather, a very wise man...... what he thought.
And he told me that all of life is a dream...... and I should choose my dreams carefully...... because they' re very powerful things.
Los Angeles, City of Angels.
Well, yet to unfold.
Who would' ve thought I' d end up like this?
It turned out that Uncle Alfonso wasn' t the taco king of L. A.
But he was the assistant manager and he did get me this job...... so I shouldn' t complain, but I can' t take those hats.
Here she comes.
- Hi.
What can I do for you?
I' il have a Happy Burrito combo with extra cheese.
That' s Nina, the love of my life.
And she doesn' t even know that I exist.
Happy Burrito with extra cheese.
- To go.
Absolutely.
Hi there, baby doll...... angel...... precious...... beautiful pussycat.
When you look at me...... you kill me.
You make me chase my tail in circles.
Okay, that' s going to be 3. 75.
And I' m really sorry about him.
Yeah, whatever.
That' s 3...... and that' s 4.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
I know it.
Don' t bet on it, taco boy.
You know that women don' t like your macho comments.
What they appreciate is to be spoken to with respect.
Respeto, that' s what it' s all about, chivo.
What you talking about?
Didn' t you see that?
I' il be like, "Call me taco boy!
Call me taco boy! "
It' s amazing what depths a person will sink to when they get desperate.
But as long as I could play my music, I didn' t care.
Most people have forgotten about the dreams that brought them here.
But then again, so have I.
Well, thank you.
This next song is "Lonely Girl."
And remember, the more you drink, the better I sound.
Clean this up.
Thank you very much.
We' re gonna take a short break...... and I' il be right back, so please don' t go away.
Thank you.
Give me a hand with the stuff.
Wake up.
You guys...... are so losing your Game Boy...... as soon as I get this in the house.
- Gonna give me a hand?
- I' il give you a hand.
I got it.
It' s okay.
- Yeah.
- And where do you live?
- I live next door.
Well, I hope you' re not planning on making too much noise, okay?
Let' s do this right.
- Hi.
- What' s your name?
Mirabela.
- Let' s get started.
I can get the rest.
Just this one will be good.
I just wanted to say to you that...... that I' m really sorry about my co- worker' s behaviour the other day.
He' s not very smart sometimes.
- You' re the guy from the taco place.
I' m Antonio.
- I' m Nina.
- How are you?
Look, I wanted to ask you...... I don' t know if you wanted to go to dinner or dancing this Friday...... I was wondering if you were available to do me the honour?
Is that a date you' re asking for?
I think so.
I' m flattered, but I will have to say no.
- Okay.
Maybe some other time.
I' m gonna be there anyway, Friday night at La Zona Rosa...... if you....
- If you change your mind or....
- Thank you.
Who was that?
I don' t know.
What' s up, uncle?
Antonio, look around this place.
It doesn' t take all these people to roll a burrito.
We have way too many workers.
We' re gonna have to let someone go.
Since you were the last one hired...... l guess you have to be the first one fired.
I can' t do anything about it.
It' s corporate.
I' m your blood!
I' m really sorry.
Take it!
Take it!
It' il hold you over...... for a while at least, until you find something else.
You' il be okay, Tonio.
You' re young, you' re strong.
- You' il be okay, eh?
Thanks for everything, uncle.
I don' t know, maybe I' il go back to Mexico.
You know, I would if I could...... but I can' t because I' m a total failure.
So what?
Yeah, but nobody wants to hear my music.
Girls don' t wanna be with a broke musician.
I' m scrawny, I' m short.
Don' t let nobody tell you about what people wanna hear.
After a while, they look for something real.
- You think?
- Yeah, that' s why I took this NPR job.
Because that pays the big dollars.
Maybe you should enter that contest.
What contest?
What contest?
It' s only the largest Latino band competition this side of Tijuana.
- How come I haven' t heard about it?
The winner gets to open a concert for a world- famous mystery musician.
You know what the top money is?
Ten thousand dollars?
Ten thousand dollars.
Keep the noise down.
I' m sorry.
If you' re gonna play music...... then play music.
You might wanna hear something from my collection.
You have a collection?
I gotta see this.
Let me just see what you have.
- The oldies.
- That' s the good stuff.
You don' t have to tell me that.
Come inside, we' il play them together.
No, thanks, I' ve heard them.
I gotta get back to my card game.
- Solitaire.
Solitaire?
Oh, come on, by yourself?
Come over here, we' il play the songs.
José José.
You know, my father used to play with him.
And he told me some gossip.
He said that José José' s father...... only wanted classical music in the house...... because he was an operatic singer...... and forbade him to play that pop.
- I want to see that.... let' s see if you know who this is.
- Okay, I don' t wanna see it.
- I know how to do this, thank you.
I know that.
That' s Paquita la del Barrio.
Also known as Francisca Viveros Barradas.
The defender of women against el macho.
Yeah.
She sings about getting dumped.
I can relate.
Do you know who this is?
- Perfidia.
That' s Alberto Dominguez, and his Xavier Cugat version.
When they told Xavier Cugat that his music...... was too much middle- of- the- road...... he said, "Well, I' d rather play 'Chiquita Banana'...... and have a swimming pool than play Bach and starve."
- He said that?
- Yes, he did.
- How come you know so much?
- Because I' m a geek, that' s why.
What are you doing?
What are you talking about?
You' re just incredible, the way you sing.
It made the hair on my arm stand up, look at that.
- You should be singing all the time.
- No, I' m too old.
But that was a long time ago.
With my ex, Javier.
Back in Veracruz, we had some really good times.
-... and dumped me.
- You know what...... forget the loss, you know, just be happy that it happened.
Well, I' ve stayed too long.
I gotta get back to my kids.
And don' t play them too loud.
Making your intention your reality.
My 10- step program for making the intention...... of creating a stress- free, tranquil mind your daily experience.
Remember that your natural state is joy.
That' s Latin America' s best music.
Now settle back...... here' s a groove for you that' s gonna warm up your afternoon.
Look at that.
I' m gonna do it.
- You' re gonna go back to Mexico?
No.
I want to enter the contest.
- I knew it.
- I knew it.
- But I gotta change my sound.
I can' t do that 18- year- old, hormone- crazed --
You know what?
- Why?
- You do?
- I don' t know.
I mean, I wanna keep the old- school sound vibe.
Help me find some guys I have a chemistry with.
I think I' ve got a couple of guys that could be just the right guys for you.
Okay, we' re back.
Excuse me.
You had a "Help Wanted" sign out there?
Someone' s here for the job.
Raj, I' m right here.
There' s no need to yell, son.
- Yes, sir.
You ever pump gas before?
No, sir.
Well, that' s all right, because we don' t have any gas pumps.
You seem like a good guy.
You got the job.
You start tomorrow morning, 8 a. m.
That' s okay, it' s great.
I' il be here a half- hour early then.
- Thank you very much.
- You' re very welcome.
Thanks a lot.
- It' s cool.
- Don' t worry about it.
Okay.
- Clumsy fellow, huh?
- Shit happens.
I like him.
Papá, please eat your food.
I thought we were going out.
Why aren' t you dressed yet?
Come on.
He' s gonna be fine.
You don' t do anything anymore except study and worry about your dad.
You' re turning into a geek.
Sure, mija.
You go out and have fun.
Okay, I' m gonna change really fast.
Come on, let' s go dance.
- I know.
- Yes.
That' s him, right?
He looks super cute tonight.
- What are you talking about?
He looks like a nice guy.
I' m very sorry.
Excuse me.
May I have this dance with you?
- No, no.
It' s worth the wait.
Okay, here we are.
All right, you ready?
It looks so small.
Nothing like it feels.
You know, sometimes when I just feel like...... the whole city' s gonna swallow me up...... and I don' t want to crawl on all fours anymore...... I come up here and I feel....
I feel like anything can happen up here.
I can, I don' t know, suck the moon.
I could be president.
Oh, God, I' m weird, right?
What do you wish?
I wish that...... my mother was still alive.
One day...... I told her that...... I would be the first one in the family to be a doctor.
A veterinarian.
And I' il never forget...
... she smiled at me and she said:
"Paloma...... you' re gonna be the best...... veterinarian in the world."
You' re going to be.
I feel it.
Because she' s gone now.
Oh, my God, you' re beautiful.
Inside and outside.
I' m sorry.
I don' t know, I couldn' t help myself, I....
Come on, Papá.
I' il help you into bed.
Hold on one moment, please.
- Hi, Miss Acosta?
- Hi.
I' m happy to say that your father' s gonna be fine.
Thank you, doctor.
He had a stroke, but it was only a minor one.
He' s gonna need some extra care for a while, but he' s gonna fully recover.
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.
That I' il never understand.
All right, all right.
That is what you do.
I can' t.
You are not over him, are you?
I am so completely over that pig of a man.
You know what I' m gonna do?
- I am gonna do a psychic reading.
That' s what you need right now.
- And are you ready?
Here we go.
- What do you mean, clues?
Well, so that you' il recognize him when you meet him.
First, he will be a great lover of music.
Oh, that' s nice.
Second, he will cherish the colour red.
He will serve you...... the greatest meal you have ever had.
So fabulous that you will scream with joy.
I don' t know.
But either way, there' s food involved, for sure.
When do I meet him?
I don' t know.
Papá, I was so scared.
I thought I was gonna lose you too.
Why did you even worry?
Not yet, anyway.
You know, Nina...... I died for a minute, and guess what.
I saw Mamá.
Really?
- Oh, she is doing great.
Beautiful as ever.
And you know what else?
She says she will wait for me until it' s my time to cross over.
And she will have a big plate of my favourite spicy tamales...... just for me, so I can smell my way to the other side.
That' s sweet, Papá.
Just as long as you' re not planning on having those tamales too soon.
Mamá told me it is not my time yet.
He actually talked to his dead wife.
He actually talked to his dead wife.
How did he end up...?
What was the communication between them?
It was tamales.
Imagine that.
Now, let' s go.
Nobody knows who they are yet.
But they' re on their way up.
That' s Pancho on the guitar, Enrique on the bass...... and José on the drums.
Raj, can I ask you something?
My fiancée.
And I' ve known her for about three years.
Three years, huh?
How did you know that she was the one?
You knew.
Are you kidding?
I had to chase her around like some crazy fool.
But you know what they say, when a man knows, he knows.
It' s black and white for us men, no grey stuff in between.
That' s right.
Last question.
How did you hook her?
What did you do?
I bought her a lot of beautiful gifts.
And most importantly, I made her confident I' d be able to provide for her.
Women wanna know that a guy can take care of her...... a guy that can really bring home the bacon.
I say this even though I' m a vegetarian.
- Well, thank you.
- You' re welcome.
Look, I hope I' m not bothering you.
Nothing more.
No, really.
She wouldn' t believe that.
Thank you, mija.
Here, let me close the curtains so you can watch your show better.
I like them open.
Look, I' m not stalking you.
No, why would l?
It' s better like this.
- What was that all about?
- What was what all about?
The band is not all about you and your guitar.
Yeah?
- You should know this.
Can we just break it down a little bit so I could hear myself?
Wait, wait.
Pancho, I thought you told me you were cool with this setup.
You told me you were not the lead vocalist type.
Look....
Look, we came here together for the contest, all right?
And exposure is something...... that each and every one of you needs right now.
So let' s drop the egos...... and let' s get out of the way of the music, okay?
I' m sorry, man.
I don' t know what happened to me.
I don' t know what' s wrong with me.
You know what I mean?
I think he plays good.
Well, yeah, I mean, the guy can play.
Yeah.
Look, guys, just go with me on this one, all right?
- We' re gonna win the $10, 000 -- - Thank you.
We' re gonna win the $10, 000.
We' il win the whole thing.
- I just want to play.
We all want to play.
- Come on.
I came to see how the two of you are.
I left so many messages.
I know.
I haven' t been able to return your calls.
I' ve been really busy with Papá.
That' s not what I meant.
I mean, that' s why I came by, because I wanted to help you.
Well, there' s nothing that you can really do.
I just have to be here.
That' s why he got in trouble in the first place...... because I wasn' t here for him.
But now is when you really need your friends, right?
- I brought you something.
- No, I can' t take it.
I want you to have it.
I can' t be with you, Antonio.
Why?
I just can' t.
Please understand.
Don' t make it harder on me.
Nina...... I' m here for you.
X marks the place.
Thank you.
They' re not coming.
They quit.
- Yeah.
That' s great.
That' s a really classy move.
I know.
Tonio.
I' il buy you one.
Because he thinks he' s better than me.
Listen.
Thank you.
Thank you for giving me that.
He always....
Always has all those airs.
You guys have any requests?
Requests?
What do you call yourselves?
Los Hermanos Solitos.
"The Lonely Brothers."
Why so lonely, huh?
- We' re all single.
- We have no girlfriends, no wives.
No problem.
Right, that' s how it is.
You have anything original?
- I always want something original.
That' s what you wanted, that' s what you got.
- Just leave me alone.
- No way.
But, Javier, look...... don' t forget to be a father to our babies, huh?
They need that.
You just can' t drop them too.
You can' t divorce your children.
Very good.
Where have you been?
For you.
- Yes.
I just wanted to thank you for reminding me...... that my world is music.
- I don' t deserve this.
- What, are you kidding?
Don' t ever say that.
Here.
- Come in.
I gotta....
Do you want to come with me?
- Laundry?
Doesn' t look like they' il notice.
- Okay.
But these are so beautiful.
I feel like a queen.
That' s because you are one.
Okay.
Okay?
- And he walked out of the studio.
That' s what I do.
- What if they don' t like you?
No, no.
I just make sure there' s no sharp objects.
I' m so glad you came.
You look beautiful.
El Zorro.
Thank you for coming.
You devilish charmer, you.
I want you to meet the rest of the group.
We have Rafael, el guitarrón.
Welcome.
- Thank you.
- A pleasure.
Jorge.
Mirabela.
I wasn' t sure if you were gonna show up.
I really started to doubt it.
And since you' re here, why don' t we...... take this opportunity...?
Now you sing with me, come on.
- Why?
- Thank you.
- What happened?
I don' t know.
- Antonio.
Did you hear?
Did you hear the way the room loved you?
It was just like my mother used to sing.
I' m not that old yet.
That' s not what I meant.
- Look.
I' m not young or sexy anymore.
Who wants to hear me sing?
I do.
I really do.
I just can' t.
- Oh, yeah.
I' ve never seen you eat this much, Papá.
I' m a new man now.
I feel so good that I could eat the whole world.
Well, you can start with your breakfast.
Where' s that nice young man you' ve been seeing?
I haven' t seen him around lately.
Since when did you notice such things?
I had a dream about the two of you last night...... and you were very happy together.
Well, that' s nice, but....
I don' t have time for dreams right now.
Our dreams are the most important thing in this life, preciosa.
Come on in.
I' m back here.
Where?
Housecleaning.
- You' re so silly.
- Hey!
Hey.
Give me that.
- Have you lost your mind?
- No, I wanna help you regain yours.
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, God.
What makes you think I wanna do that?
- I hate the thought of even doing it.
This is part of you.
Oh, God.
- You' re like all men.
You think that all a woman wants to do is play house?
I have dreams.
Big ones.
I wanna sing in front of Javier, that two- timing cheater...... in front of his girlfriend...... in front of everybody who thinks I' m not thin enough.
In front of the whole damn world.
What is so funny?
I' m laughing at you.
Because you' re funny to me.
Oh, yes, you are.
You' re very funny to me.
And don' t be late, okay?
It gets very muddy.
You know how to do laundry.
Five o' clock.
Can I ask you something?
Have you ever been truly in love?
I' m talking about, like, really, really in love?
I thought I was with Javier, but that was something else.
Look, but what if you were in love now, let' s say...... with somebody new today...... how would you tell them?
Who is she, anyway?
Well...... she' s this woman who doesn' t know her own beauty.
Well, you don' t tell a woman anything...... just show her.
Show her you love her.
She' il understand.
Not in her head, but in her heart, where it counts.
Is that in a song somewhere?
Come on in.
Come on.
Hey, look, I' ve been working on this electronic loop and....
Welcome to the Super Estrella Mystery Musician tryouts.
Welcome to the Super Estrella Mystery Musician tryouts.
Today' s bands from all over will battle it out...... to the final stage of the competition.
Only three lucky bands will advance.
So let' s kick it off with band number one, Bolivar.
She said five minutes.
Is that 25 minutes?
Okay, you can take the 5 to the 110 to the....
That was band number one, Bolivar, straight out of Monterrey, Mexico.
- Let' s hear it for Bolivar.
So keep calling in.
Your votes and our judges' votes will be tabulated.
And up next, Las Ultrasónicas.
I' m gonna make them late.
- Do I look fat?
- You look fabulous.
Mommy, you look beautiful.
Thank you, babies.
Kiss.
Kiss, kiss.
You listen to your mom on the radio, okay?
No more food.
- Thank you.
I love you.
- Good luck!
Here she comes.
You' re gorgeous.
That was Las Ultrasónicas.
It looks like you guys liked them.
Cartel de Santa is up next.
Come on, let' s go.
Come on.
Traffic was terrible.
You don' t think it' s too tight?
- No, no, no.
Looks terrific.
Let' s go.
- Let' s go.
Come on.
Up next, All Star Gringo Star.
Come here.
- What' s the matter?
- What if they don' t get me out there?
What do you mean, what if they don' t get you?
What if I' ve been lying to myself and to everybody?
- What?
Listen to me.
You' ve got it.
You' re ready for this.
Enjoy it.
Come on.
We worked really hard for this, given it everything we' ve got.
Now I want you to go out there, be brave, be bold and honest.
- Go on and have fun.
We' re El Gran Colectivo.
- Come on in.
You know, performing in front of all those people?
I usually do it in front of my family and friends...... but I guess there' s a first time for everything.
- You don' t want to jinx it.
- Thank you.
- You.
- Dr. Lopez!
- How you feeling?
- You look terrific.
- Hey, how are you?
How have you been?
You see that?
Who' s that guy Nina' s with?
Some doctor.
Looks like someone' s got Nina' s attention.
Good for him.
Not at all.
Make sure you don' t spill.
You don' t look like someone who doesn' t care.
I know I know you from somewhere.
- What' s your name?
- Beatriz?
- Yeah.
I see you almost every evening...... when I come back from work.
- Fantastic.
Nina, will you help me make outfits for the band?
Sure.
My mind' s on fire.
I don' t know what to do.
You' il be fine.
That' s me.
What can I do for you?
We' d like to talk about your career.
We think you' ve got potential.
Well, thank you.
That' s very nice of you to say.
There' s a great deal of talk lately from the major record labels...... about recruiting a fresh, new Latin talent.
A solo act to be the next big crossover.
- But I' m not a solo act.
- With our help, you could be huge.
Playing mainstream songs in English.
I don' t know, maybe you have the wrong guy.
- Okay.
I' il be right back.
- Will you start on the hem, hon?
You really do look gorgeous, you know?
No way.
I' m too skinny.
Look at me.
I wish I could have some nice curves like you do.
I' m a stick.
Why do we worry about our bodies all the time?
We' re never satisfied, are we?
Yeah, and it' s usually just to please a man.
I' ve decided that I don' t need a man.
But there is...... someone that you' re crazy about, isn' t there?
Why do you say that?
I saw you and Antonio at the party.
I' m not ready to get serious with anyone.
Do you love him?
I don' t know.
He loves you.
Really?
Oh, I' m sure of it.
- I know.
But I already have a manager.
Look, I know your manager, and he' s a really nice guy...... but he hasn' t been in the game for years.
He just can' t do for you what we can.
You know, Antonio, sometimes you just have to forget about the past.
This is a fast- paced industry.
If you don' t grab your chance when it comes around, you get left behind.
- Yesterday' s news.
I mean, to be honest with you...... it has always been my dream to just make an album.
I just want to have a CD, that' s all.
You don' t think it' s too late?
I still have a chance?
We wouldn' t be here if we didn' t.
Well, look, I really gotta think it over.
This one is on us.
- I got it.
- Thank you.
I' il take it over there for you.
- Okay.
- It' s okay.
I mean, they' re not dirty, they' re just greasy.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
- What' s up?
So you got a record deal, huh?
- Well, good for you, man.
- I need to talk to you.
- Can we talk later?
We' re late.
Opportunities?
When we' re done...... you' il have more than you ever know.
-... that you really wanted -- - Listen.
This is the reason I became a manager to begin with...... to bring beautiful music to the world.
We' re gonna bring boleros back to life.
- Yes.
Come on.
Let' s go.
I had a sofa made out of this material.
You look wonderful.
- No.
You look very handsome.
No.
Oh, my goodness, she looks beautiful.
We' re back with Pancho from All Star Gringo Star.
Do you think you got a good chance?
Yeah, I think we do have a really good chance.
Now you told me earlier...... that the contest has generated so much publicity...... that there' s talk of record industry interest.
Well, not for us, unfortunately, just yet.
But I did hear that the lead singer from El Gran Colectivo...... is signing up with a new manager...... and is going solo right after the contest, so....
So he' il be going out on his own?
Yes, the best of luck for him.
Thank you very much.
- Antonio, we need to talk to you.
And that you' re going solo?
How could you do that to Zorro and Mirabela?
How could you do that to us?
- I' m really sorry.
I should' ve told you what was going on.
- I feel really bad.
You know --
Because I keep things inside, and I should say what I' m feeling --
- No, Mirabela, wait.
I did get the offer.
And let me tell you, it was really tempting, but --
Antonio, we' d be happy for you.
I turned it down.
Because -- Because we' re better all together.
- Are you sure?
- Of course I' m sure.
Because I don' t have a big office downtown.
Who cares about a big office downtown?
Those big- office people never believed in me like you did.
"You' re gonna bring the bolero back to the people"?
- Okay.
- Guess what.
- That' s great.
I' m so happy for you.
That' s everything you wanted, right?
It' s great.
I wanted to say I' m sorry.
Sorry for what?
I think I' ve been really stupid.
No, no, you had a lot going on.
You couldn' t help but be stupid.
I' m just kidding.
I mean, what' s important right now...... is that you become everything your mother said you should become.
But...... what about us?
What about us?
You think that...... maybe we can...... start again where we left off?
I mean, I don' t know how you feel about me.
- No, I don' t.
Yes, you do.
You' re gonna go off to vet school...... find some vet and do some animal experiments.
Dissect animals and....
Thank you for shutting me up.
- I want you, Antonio.
My name is Marco Mendez from Super Estrella...... and welcome to the Mystery Musician Contest.
Tonight, one lucky band is gonna be named the winner...... and will open for the mystery musician next week.
But that' s not all.
Because that band...... is gonna walk off with $10, 000 cash today.
Zoé!
So...... how' s everybody feeling?
Have you seen how many people are out there?
- Three hundred people.
Nothing.
I' m not gonna lie to you, this is a big night.
But all those people out there...... they' re your friends, they' re your family, they' re your supporters...... they' re on your side.
You gotta forget about competing.
This is about doing what it is that you do.
- Right.
- That' s right.
They' il feel that.
Trust me.
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- What' s up?
Look, man, I....
This whole thing just got out of hand.
It' s....
Maybe I was expecting too much, I don' t know.
Yeah, well, don' t expect too much and you won' t regret too much.
Okay, now give it up for All Star Gringo Star.
I' m just gonna take a little peek at the crowd.
Don' t you dare.
Don' t let the crowd psych you out.
That bastard.
So...... skinny.
I can' t.
What' s the matter?
- I can' t do it, okay?
No, you sing the song.
I told you not to let the crowd get to you, didn' t l?
-... and he' s with her.
-... because of one dumb guy, are you?
I' m not gonna let you do it, okay?
This means so much to you, and you mean so much to me.
Of course you do.
I did?
Absolutely.
Thank you.
Oh, it' s okay.
We' re on in, like, very soon.
We got a little situation.
Her ex is out there.
- Oh, yeah.
- So?
That' s bad.
- Yeah.
- A real loser.
That' s right.
Get up on that stage and show him what you' re made of.
I don' t say much...... but you were born for this moment.
- Right, for yourself.
- For yourself.
- Yeah!
Hello, Los Angeles.
We' re El Gran Colectivo...... and this next song is a pretty song...... that I want to dedicate to somebody very special to me.
Bravo.
Ladies and gentlemen, we' re gonna recount the votes...... and we' il be right back, so don' t go away.
I just want everyone to be ready for whatever happens...... because this is gonna be very, very close.
Let' s just....
It doesn' t matter.
We have the most important thing, right?
So come on, let' s toast to the winners.
- You' re right.
Antonio' s right, because before this contest, I was solito...... and I met a beautiful girl and I have beautiful friends.
You know, it' s true, if it wasn' t for this contest...... I never would' ve met you, Mirabela, my beautiful corazón.
I' ve been crazy about you from the first moment I saw you.
I didn' t know you felt that way.
Thank you.
Allow me.
- Okay, then to the winners!
- To the winners.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the mystery musician:
El Señor José José!
Thank you very, very much.
I would like to introduce to you right now...... the winners of the Mystery Musician Contest:
El Gran Colectivo!
And now allow us to sing to you...... a very special song.
In the end, winning or losing didn' t matter.
Because together, we made something greater...... than if we each had stayed on our paths alone.
And isn' t that the beauty of life?
The love that we give and receive.
Our dreams are very powerful things.
Adam?
Sorry I' m late.
Call me lvan.
I' m a bit flustered but I' ve been looking forward to meeting you.
Let' s get going.
Let me take your bag.
Come on.
People who have been in prison are often a bit protective of their stuff.
Have you lived in the country before?
This is our small church.
Just take a look at this.
This is our apple tree.
There are lots of apples this year.
It' s probably because of the warm summer.
Don' t eat that.
Come with me.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Adam will stay with us.
This is Khalid and Gunnar.
I won' t talk to egghead.
There will be lots of time for that kind of talk.
Come on, Adam.
What does the O stand for?
In Adam O. Pedersen?
What' s the story about the O?
Your parents must have told you.
- I forgot to ask.
- That' s a good answer.
It says here that you' re a neo- Nazi.
Are you really?
It' s not the first thing that springs to mind by looking at you.
Here it says you' re EVlL.
It' s rude to write that on a person' s CV.
Are you really evil?
I didn' t think so.
We don' t believe in that.
If you only look for evil then the world is evil.
But you can try to focus on the silver lining as we do here.
That makes everything easier.
In later years the Devil has sent his troops to test us -
- but we have conquered them all.
All of us here have found God in some way.
You just met Khalid and Gunnar.
I saw that you did.
Gunnar was paroled four years ago.
He was just to stay three months, but he chose to stay.
Gunnar was what you would call an alcoholic.
He stole and raped girls but now he' s on the wagon -
- and is studying theology.
There' s also Khalid.
He used to rob gas stations.
Do you remember a young man being shot when he went to buy condoms?
- No.
- Khalid is still not allowed at Statoil.
A few hostage dramas later he' s learning Danish and is doing well.
Tell me what I have to do.
You have to discover that for yourself.
All I want is for you to set yourself a goal.
Are you listening to me?
Yes, I believe I am.
In any other situation I would say that you are rude -
What do you want your goal to be?
I would like to bake a cake.
Bake a cake?
Oh, an apple cake?
Yes, an apple cake.
- My goal is to bake a big apple cake.
- With the apples from our garden?
- Yes, the apples from the garden.
- That' s a good idea.
I think we found your goal.
You' il look after the tree until 1 st of August.
Then you' il use them to bake an apple cake.
I just wanted to give you this.
It has both the old and the new testament.
It' s a good thing to have.
Sleep tight.
Evil has many faces -
- and it can be difficult to tell them apart and choose sides.
Especially these days where so many things are said in this and that town.
Everything has so many nuances.
Also we humans.
If the game of chess had undergone the same development as humans -
- the queen would be in front, the rooks would be crooked -
- and the pawn would be the main piece.
We no longer know who we are and this rootlessness...
Are we boring you, Poul?
- Are we boring you?
- I need to go to the loo.
- Can' t it wait?
- Not really.
We finish in 20 minutes.
- I think that Poul can wait that long.
- Let him go for sake of fuck and crap.
- So we can song sing now.
- Okay, democracy has spoken.
Go, Poul.
Go take a crap.
- But you can' t come back in.
- That' s okay.
You have to use the hospital loo because you can' t use ours.
- Why not?
- It' s locked during the service.
- Why?
- For security reasons.
Let' s continue if it' s okay with Poul.
We' il sing 634 "You know my heart".
There' s fried pork.
It was a good sermon today.
At least it was shorter than usual.
Too bad for old Poul Nordkap.
Ivan is always on his case.
It' s not nice of him.
He always does that.
It' s because he was in a concentration camp during the war.
He' s 86.
It won' t be any fun when that age comes.
Don' t worry about lvan.
He' s okay.
Just don' t venture into an argument with him.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Me?
- My phone!
- I thought you were sleeping.
And my wallet!
Are you stealing my stuff?
Have you gone insane?
- I' m sorry.
- Piss off, fatso!
- Sleep tight.
- Piss off!
- They' re not moving.
- They cheeky for sake of fuck!
Fly home bird for sake of fuck!
What are we going to do?
There won' t be any apples left for your cake.
Let the paki monkey climb up and shoo them away.
- I' m not talking to you.
- I don' t know anything about birds.
What do we do in a case like this?
You leave them alone, I think.
- Can' t we let them eat the apples?
- They' re Adam' s apples for the cake.
- For sake of fuck, he can' t bake.
- You don' t know that.
If Adam wants to bake us a cake it' s our job to support him.
- I can tell.
- What the fuck do you know, paki?
That' s the right attitude.
That kind of attitude will get us some cake.
- There' s more of them coming.
- That' s just plain rude.
That' s good.
- No bird will come back now.
- Reverend Fjeldsted?
Yes?
Call me lvan.
- Hi.
This is my assistant Adam.
I' m not from around here.
I wanted to come to the service but I couldn' t.
Don' t apologise.
You only cheat yourself.
What' s this?
You' re in a bad way.
- The milk has gone bad.
- Fine.
- Me too.
- No, you didn' t.
Are you?
This may be the right time and place.
John says:
"He came to Canaan after having turned water into wine."
Jesus said:
Don' t call me inconsiderate.
- It' s okay.
I don' t take milk.
- Maybe we have some cookies.
Adam, could you go see if there' s a few cookies for Sarah and me?
- Maybe I shouldn' t have come.
- Sure.
So you met a guy?
I have been in Indonesia working for the World Wide Fund for Nature.
I made love to a man and got pregnant.
I used to drink a lot before.
Now I' m in AA and I' ve been sober for 341 days.
Now they' re saying that the baby may be handicapped.
- I don' t know where the dad is...
- Just a second, Sarah.
Why do I get three cookies and Sarah only two?
Don' t you find that odd?
Hers looked bigger.
I don' t think so.
Have you measured the cookies?
He never does that.
Let' s stop this discussion.
- Yes...
There' s a 60% chance that the baby is handicapped.
I have to decide within a week before it' s too late.
I can' t handle a handicapped child.
60 per cent is a lot, right?
It' s just statistics.
When we were expecting our son we were told that he could be disabled.
We could have been intimidated by statistics and reason -
- but we chose to look at the bright side, and now...
When I see him run around in the garden or doing his homework -
- we' re happy that we chose to have him.
You won' t find anyone to say otherwise.
The Devil is testing us all the time.
We have to make the right choices.
If we all listened to reason the world would be a gloomy place to live.
You need to follow you heart and have the baby.
- Good morning.
Fuck, that hurt!
Why the hell haven' t you turned the cooker off?
This looks bad.
What did reverend Fjeldsted say?
He' s a frigging idiot.
He may be weird, but he' s a good boy.
His life sure as shit hasn' t been easy.
Everything went wrong from the start.
His mother died giving birth to him.
- Ivan?
They took lvan away?
No, nobody took lvan away.
Henning.
Why?
He was fucking those kids black and blue.
They could hardly walk.
- Shut up and fix this.
- Pardon my forthrightness.
I' ve learned it' s best to tell it like it is.
You' re best served by being told the truth.
The cooker bit you?
- Gunnar forgot to turn it of.
I' d like to talk to you.
Do you know why all this is happening?
Why are all these birds in the tree?
And the cooker.
Why did you burn yourself all of the sudden?
I think someone is trying to tell you that you shouldn' t go near the cooker.
You can' t bake a cake without a cooker.
I think Satan is testing us.
By not letting me bake the cake?
He' s trying to fight us.
He' s testing your strength to withstand him.
Look at your hand.
Nobody is doing anything.
- Gunnar just forgot to turn it off.
- He always makes sure to turn it off.
- Hey, fat and drunk!
So many accusations, but there may be an explanation.
You should know that he was the best Danish tennis player in his youth.
He won all his matches but then a ball was mistakenly called to be out.
Gunnar lost and everything went downhill.
What about Khalid?
This was in his coat pocket.
- What are you saying?
- You' re a joke.
- Let' s forbid people to wear hats.
- It' s a balaclava during summer.
- Khalid is from a hot climate.
- Here' s fucking 17, 000 in cash.
- You' re reaching, Adam.
Khalid is saving to buy new clothes.
You didn' t know.
Give me my phone and my wallet or I' il smash your face in.
That' s not fucking mine!
Stay away from my stuff.
Do you understand?
You' re lucky that I' m going back in because I would beat you every day.
- I' m going to the casualty room, - Will you pass the market?
- I could.
- Could you get my cough syrup?
- Sure, what' s it called?
- Von Osten.
Think about what we can do about the birds, if you have time.
Here you go.
It can' t be traced but throw it away anyway.
Can you shoot with that hand?
He' s fucked up.
- Now he' s all turn the other cheek.
- But you' re getting out in 11 weeks.
We' re waiting for you.
- I' m not going to shoot him.
- I just want to understand.
Does it involve the pear pie?
Espen says you talk about a pie.
It doesn' t matter.
I said that I would bake a cake and the idiot won' t let up.
He says that the Devil is testing us because birds are eating the apples.
Do you need help?
Who the fuck do you think you' re talking to?
See you.
Go on.
Get them!
Don' t be afraid.
Get them.
- He' s making them nervous.
- They care fucking not about the cat.
- All can see.
- Yes.
Lambert is not working.
My granddad had a cherry tree.
It was attacked by birds, so he shot a few in the morning and evening.
Shot them?
With a gun?
No, a waffle iron.
What gun?
One like this.
I think that we should try it.
Can you take them from there?
For sake of fuck, why you not said?
- Lambert?
Lambert, are you okay?
What just happened?
He' s dead.
- It was a shit cat anyhow.
- He shot my cat.
It was an old cat.
He just happened to fall down while we were shooting.
Okay.
We talked about your grandfather.
I think it' s going to be a good day.
It' s too bad that Khalid won' t come in when we' re making his favourite food.
- He' s embarrassed about Lambert.
- Is he a terrorist?
You should see his dream house.
It' s really nice.
With a bit more Statoil money he can go home.
- Why not just rob a bank - Khalid is very committed to politics.
He only robs multinational companies.
That' s why he robs Statoil.
Statoil stole his father' s land for the oil.
Khalid is taking back his property.
- Statoil is Norwegian.
- No, I don' t think so.
- Statoil is Norwegian!
- Remember to tell Khalid that.
- Yes.
Ivan just want him to be calm.
Ivan is not exactly normal.
The anniversary of his wife' s death is coming up.
- He had a wife?
- Yes, Linda.
She ate some pills and killed herself because they got a handicapped son.
He' s got cerebral palsy.
She couldn' t take that.
Can I come in?
Adam, there sure is no shortage of recipes for apple cake in this world.
It looks like we' ve won round one.
Your father?
- That' s Hitler.
No, Hitler had a beard.
You' re right.
I' m thinking of that Russian guy.
I' il leave you to it.
Hitler' s enemies didn' t take him seriously either.
Don' t you think that I do?
That' s just plain rude.
Old Paul Nordkap who' s in the hospital with no will to live -
- he was a bigger Nazi than anyone.
Why do you think they ask me to cheer him up?
Sure.
He was working there.
He met Goblins and all those folks.
- Goebbels?
- He was probably also there.
Then we can see who takes who seriously.
Deal?
I' m glad that you could make it.
He won' t last through the night.
I broke it to him gently.
Well, let' s give him a good sendoff.
- Okay.
What about the honker, lvan?
It took quite a beating.
You don' t have to waste money on perfume anymore, lvan.
Yes.
Come on, Adam.
What' s up with you, Poul?
Have you lost your appetite?
- I' ve brought a guest for you.
Adam Pedersen.
- Are you feeling a bit low?
- I' m scared.
What have you been up to?
- Have the nurses been nicer to you?
I don' t deserve it.
They have been nagging Poul because of this past but we put a stop to that.
Has Miriam been nicer to you?
Yes, she made me hot chocolate yesterday and tucked me in.
- They are all so nice to me.
- That' s good.
- I don' t deserve it.
- Everybody deserves to be tucked in.
- Did she fluff your duvet and pillow?
There, there.
I apologise for trying to cheat.
I just don' t like being inside the church.
- That' s all forgotten now.
I' m scared, lvan.
I dare not sleep.
I' m so afraid.
You have nothing to worry about.
Let' s focus on the people who cares for you and all your lovely memories.
Poul, don' t cry anymore.
Don' t be so hard on yourself.
All has been forgiven.
If you only knew what we did...
All those poor people.
- It can' t be forgiven.
- Stop it.
Nobody remembers anymore.
Oh God!
Stop your whinging.
It' s not as bad as all that.
We all make mistakes but we don' t let it bring us down.
You' re crazy, man.
Why do you say that?
Why spoil the mood by being plain rude?
I' d be happy to discuss it, but this is not the place.
Let' s focus on the word of God.
God forgives all, Poul.
God forgives all.
It' s difficult.
Even though you seen it before it' s still difficult every time.
- Yes, I talked to lots.
- A wife' s suicide must be painful.
- Yes, that can' t be nice.
- Linda didn' t take her own life.
- But she took pills?
Yes, but it was an accident.
Accident how?
Christoffer had been playing with her pills and had put them in a candy dish.
Linda always had a sweet tooth and she thought they were yellow M& Ms.
Your son Christoffer?
- So he' s actually able to move?
- Why wouldn' t he be?
- No, I wish.
There' s no stopping him.
Just yesterday he was playing rounders.
I don' t believe you, lvan.
- I just don' t.
- I' ve never heard anything that crazy.
Has Gunnar told tall stories and played fast and loose with the truth?
If it is that' s just plain rude.
Why don' t you bring him tomorrow?
He' s been pestering me all week to come.
- Good.
- Then you can see for yourself.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Christoffer, this is Adam.
Adam, Christoffer.
Yum, eggs.
Small mouthfuls.
- He' s paralysed.
- What did you say?
- I have to go in tower.
- You two stay here.
- I need shoot black bird.
- Sit down.
He' s paralysed.
Christoffer, go into daddy' s office.
What did you say?
He' s paralysed.
Isn' t he paralysed, lvan?
Is he really, Adam?
Yes, he has cerebral palsy.
That is just crazy.
Khalid, what do you have to say?
Khalid?
Him is it.
Ivan, he' s spastic paralysed.
Your son' s a spastic.
Your wife killed herself.
Your dad raped you.
Look at me, lvan.
Look at me.
You bleeding from an ear.
You bleeding from an ear, for sake of fuck!
The other way.
- Ivan was bleeding from an ear.
- That has happened to me.
Plenty of milk.
Just give up, lvan.
There' s something you should know.
Christoffer is recovering from a very nasty bout of the flu.
I' m the first to admit that he' s been a bit sluggish lately.
- Shut the fuck up!
- If he hurts you turn the other cheek.
God is on my side.
What is his problem?
He needs to be locked up!
I' m not one to gossip -
- but he' s always been considered a phenomenon.
- I don' t know if you know?
- How the hell should I know?
- He' s sick.
Very sick.
- I bloody well know that.
No, not like that.
Well, he is that too -
- but he' s terminally ill.
- What' s wrong with him?
He has a brain tumour the size of a volleyball.
I' ve never seen anyone with such a large brain tumour.
I' il bash your face in if you call him a walking miracle.
Have you heard about the Ravashi syndrome?
Ravashi was an Indian footballer -
- who lost both his feet in a go- kart accident in 1957.
In a state of shock over the accident he ran home on the stumps of his legs.
His brain blocked the fact that he had no feet.
- He kept his midfield position.
- Without feet?
They were maybe in the fifth league.
Ivan has experienced so much hardship -
- that he needs to find an explanation in order to live with it.
That' s why he thinks that the Devil has it in for him.
Ivan would say that everything is a test.
You' re a test, his cancer is a test, his son' s handicap is a test.
In lvan' s mind he' s locked in fierce battle with the Devil himself.
Ivan has no mind to lose and he blocks out everything like Ravashi.
He' s in denial about all the bad stuff.
Death, mutilation, hardship, evil.
That simply doesn' t exist in lvan' s world.
Why does he bleed from his ears?
We have asked ourselves that.
I think it' s when something comes too close.
Someone once got through to him.
He bled from his ears once before.
That was three years ago.
- What happened?
- You don' t know his sister Katinka.
A total slapper.
She fucked everybody.
I even fucked her when she was here to have her adenoids removed.
When she died lvan almost fell to pieces.
He bled from his ears and got sick.
- What happened then?
- You know lvan.
A few days later he was jolly as ever.
You could kill him by making him understand?
Yes, in theory.
Give up, Adam.
God is on my side.
Never forget that.
Hi.
The cooker is broken.
- I wanted to make Christoffer a pizza.
- We' il get by.
- Where did Christoffer go?
- He' s in your office with a woman.
She' s quite upset.
Her name is Sarah and she' s a real hottie.
When she saw Christoffer she started screaming.
She didn' t want coffee.
Well, we' d better...
So nice of you to visit again.
- Has he been good?
I can' t because this is Christoffer.
Have you two been introduced?
- Say what kind of things?
You said that nothing was wrong with him.
Yes, he can.
Even the complicated kind.
Adam, maybe you should go get some of the cookies that Sarah likes.
I' il come too.
Is anyone hungry?
We' il see if this one lasts a bit longer.
- What are you doing?
- Gunnar is good.
- But you' re pregnant.
- We' re rewriting an article.
- About what?
- The tigers in the Orient.
Here they write that there' s only 400 left.
That' s a sure way to make them extinct.
- Like last round at the pub.
- What do you do then, Gunnar?
- You buy a pint an a chaser.
Gunnar is right.
We have to do something.
- Shut up, man!
- Stay out of it.
Yes, Adam, stop disturbing us because we' re busy.
- Five tigers is dying every day.
Six tigers a day, Adam.
They can really jump high those tigers.
I' il come right out and say it.
You better come with me.
There' s a new apple problem.
Shall we say in five minutes by the tree?
I look fruit and see worm.
No, I actually discovered it, but I don' t need any credit.
For sake of fuck, is on all fruit.
That' s just plain rude.
Yes, Adam, it never stops.
Let' s do something about it.
Take down the sick fruit and spray the rest.
Gunnar, come with me.
We have to arrange Poul' s return to God.
Poul Bækel Hermann, known to friend and foe as Poul Nordkap -
- lived a long and full life.
In his life Poul learned that to know God you must dance with the Devil.
If any Poul Nordkap surely did that.
Poul learned that it' s futile to fight good because -
- despite all the cruelty, screaming and tears he had caused in his youth -
- he realised in the end that this was just a mere moment.
The ocean heaved but it was a wasted effort.
The world continued and good prevailed as always.
That' s why Poul can return to God with peace of mind.
Adam and I were by his side when he passed quietly away.
"I' m not afraid.
I' m ready. "
But this is not all about Poul -
- because today Christoffer turns nine.
Before we gorge ourselves on cake -
- let' s honour Poul with a hymn.
Kaj Munk' s number 634.
"You know my heart".
There you are.
I thought you had gone to bed.
- I' d like to talk to you.
- Can' t it wait?
It has been a long day for Christoffer with all this attention.
- I' d like to talk to you now.
Go into dad' s office and cuddle up under a blanket.
What' s up with you?
Is the business with the birthday cake?
- What if the Devil isn' t testing you?
What if it isn' t him who' s been dogging you?
I see.
You' re reaching again.
If not the Devil then who?
A little elf?
Maybe all the birds, the cooker and the worms are just a coincidence?
- Is that what you' re telling people?
- God.
- Pardon?
- God.
- I don' t understand.
Why would he do that?
Because he hates you.
I' ve read this book.
Book of Job.
- You' ve read it, right?
That' s what I' ve heard.
Yes, it' s about a crocodile, but it' s also about much more.
His seven camels and his ten kids?
He takes everything away from him and makes him a leper.
Does that remind you of anything?
Look at me.
Look at me, lvan!
You know that God is behind this, right?
God is not on your side, lvan.
Yes, he is.
I don' t believe any of this shit.
I just want you to know that it' s God.
The Devil hasn' t wasted any time on you.
God wants to kill you.
You' re just so dense that you don' t get it.
Because I' m evil.
You can' t change that.
There fire in sky.
Him lvan gone?
He forgot moron kid.
For sake of fuck, it was all fresh!
Every night we now go to bed hungry.
You could use him as a crapper.
- No.
Is he going to...
- Die?
You bet your ass he is.
Why do you think that the bloke began bleeding from all orifices in his skull?
I give him four weeks, five tops.
From a medical point of view it doesn' t matter.
He' s come to his senses.
Somehow you' ve managed to take away his faith.
- That' s why I want to buy you coffee.
- It doesn' t matter.
Well excuse me.
Are you ready?
Get up, lvan, we need the room.
Go with Adam.
Are you coming?
We' il give him a room and a shot of morphine.
God hates us, Christoffer.
He' s always hated us.
It doesn' t look too good.
Gather the others.
Well, the fact is...
Adam already knows but...
I' m dying.
- Die how?
- I' il sleep with the worms.
- Are you not going to stay?
- No, that would be difficult.
What are we to do?
Well, I hope that you...
I don' t know.
I don' t know what you should do.
I don' t know anything anymore.
If I said anything that you can use then do that or don' t.
I don' t care.
That' s all.
- Where you' re going?
I' ve earned that.
- Gunnar...
- Leave me alone.
- Gunnar, that' s stupid.
You had a hair.
Here' s one more.
We have three.
- Ivan deserve good cake.
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I' m picking apples.
- With a paki?
- What happened?
- Lightning.
What' s wrong with you?
Are you fucking kidding us?
- You climb trees with a nigger.
- Esben, just go home.
- He say go away and take fat friend.
Jørgen, let' s teach our little Black friend some manners.
What the fuck are you doing?
I feel stress.
- Here witness.
Him done before.
- He shot me!
- Take him with you.
- You' il regret this.
And you, nigger, you' re dead.
I have gun.
- You can' t just shoot people.
He came with that shoulder.
There' s his back.
Stop it!
I are off balance.
I no like seeing lvan like that.
It' s a shitty day.
I want leave this faggot country.
You have to talk to him.
He has problems.
Gunnar is also behaving strangely.
They need you.
- Leave me alone.
Yes, but just have a talk with them.
They' il listen to you.
I' il put the apples in the fridge.
Do as you please.
Gunnar, what are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Where' s Sarah?
- She' s gone home.
- What' s with all those things?
- It' s just an aubergine...
- And the racket?
It was in.
Everyone said that is was in.
- Go on in.
- Not while you are here.
Can I see how you live?
No.
- She got very drunk.
Nothing yet.
She just got drunk.
- Put that stuff down.
It' s her fault for getting that drunk.
Let' s go to bed.
You come with me.
- Wow, so many guns.
- Khalid, where are you going?
Statoil must die.
- No.
- You won' t shoot anyone, right?
I no want to shoot you.
You meddle and I shoot your face.
- Can we go with you?
- You want rob with me?
- So nice.
No.
Get in.
I' il go in first.
I have to use the loo.
Okay, but no shooting anyone before me come in.
Hat on, Gunnar.
Run!
Get out of here!
Get out!
Run!
- Where' s employee?
- They ran.
For sake of fuck!
- Are you done?
- Don' t you want some cigarettes?
Stop it!
Let' s go!
Are you hurt?
That went well.
You have to talk to lvan.
You need help, both of you.
He also needs help.
Come on.
- Take of that hat.
- Yes.
- Hi.
Where did you go last night?
- We were at the gas station.
- Was I very drunk?
- No, you were nice.
What are you doing?
Where are the other apples?
- We ate them.
- Have you eaten seven apples?
- He was hungry.
You only had beer.
- For fuck' s sake!
You look good in that outfit.
Did we fool around yesterday?
The girlie boys are here again.
There are more.
- Go into the church.
- I no hide from that bunch of faggots.
Look how many they are.
Go into the church.
You can go fuck yourself.
- We just want the paki.
- Will you stop that noise!
I really shouldn' t have come out here and ask for some peace and quite.
I have six, maybe seven, days left to live.
I deserve to be able to nap.
I can' t manage you rude people.
Please leave.
We just want the paki and do him.
Do what you want.
You can take him to the woods.
I just want peace.
- Get him!
- That is just plain rude!
We' il do this another way.
Give me everything that makes noise.
What the fuck was he doing?
Asshole!
- I wasn' t my fault.
- Let' s get out of here.
In medical terms this is called a half Kennedy.
In medical terms this is called a half Kennedy.
I can assure you of that.
Well, you just say your goodbyes and I' il stick the kettle on.
It' s for the dead.
Shut up, Gunnar.
So goodbye to you all.
Ivan may return.
I have to go home.
What you say, Adam.
I don' t know.
You decide.
I sorry about lvan.
I sorry that you can' t make cake.
See you, Adam and the Sarah.
Fuck you, Gunnar.
Well, okay.
- Go to your room.
- Don' t get angry, but...
- Where is that from?
I took it by accident.
I' m sorry.
I' il never do it again.
- Enter.
- Yes.
- Where is he?
It doesn' t make sense.
I believe in figures.
I' m going somewhere where the sick die -
- and don' t go sit in the garden with a cheese burger after having been shot.
- Yes.
He just got up and went for a walk.
The bullet simply shot the tumour away.
Now they' re telling me that the bloke is well again.
I' ve bloody well had it.
Hi, Adam.
- I baked an apple cake.
- Yes.
Should we have a go?
- What' s the name of the child?
- Ivan Lambert Andersen.
Ivan Lambert Andersen...
Amen.
- Thank you.
- You' re welcome.
- Come back.
- No time.
- Interesting.
Because of the tigers?
No, I plan to play tennis again.
They have the best courts.
It' s because of junior.
With his Down' s syndrome he' il just look like the others.
Yes, tigers are really fascinating.
- We have to go.
- Don' t you have to change?

This is my assistant, Adam Ole Pedersen.
Well, let' s go.

- You look like a spastic.
Really?
I think that' s just a rude way to break the ice
We' il come through town so let' s ask what they think of me.
This is not the place for that discussion because you' il lose.
We' il discuss it in the car.
Good idea with that discussion.
[Fidel Castro Speaking Spanish]
Okay, so what do you call yourself?
Antonio Montana.
And you, what you call yourself?
- Where' d you learn to speak the English, Tony?
And my father, he was, uh, from the United States.
Just like you, ya know?
He was a Yankee.
Uh, he used to take me a lot to the movies.
I watch the guys like Humphrey Bogart,
I like those guys.
I always know one day I' m comin 'here, United States.

Sometime.
Somewhere.

I was, uh -- This, that.
I work a lot with my hands.
I was in the army.
Any family in the States, Tony?
Any cousins, brother- in- law, anybody?
Everybody' s dead.
- Me?
Jail?
No way.
No.
Been in a mental hospital?
Oh, yeah.
What about homosexuality, Tony?
You like men, huh?
You like to dress up like a woman?
What the fuck is wrong with this guy?
Just answer the questions, Tony?
Okay.
Okay?
Arrested for vagrancy?
Marijuana?
- Never, man.
- Cocaine?
- No.
Where' d you get the beauty scar, tough guy?
Eatin 'pussy?
How am I gonna get a scar like that eating pussy?
- This was when I was a kid, ya know?
You should see the other kid.
You can' t recognize him.
And this?
That' s for my sweetheart.
Sweetheart, my ass!
We' ve been seein 'more and more of these.
Some kind of code these guys used in the can.
Pitchfork means an assassin or somethin '.
You wanna tell us about it, or do you wanna take a little trip to the detention center?
Okay, you got me.
I was in the can one time.
For buying dollars.
- That' s pretty funny, Tony.
- Well, that' s true.
It was a Canadian tourist.
Mug him first?
Get him outta here!
- Come on!
Let me talk to this guy.
Please!
Let me talk to him a minute.
You a Communist?
How' d you like it, man?
They tell you all the time what to do, what to think, what to feel.
Do you wanna be like a sheep?
Like all those other people?
Baah.
I don' t have to listen to this bullshit!
You wanna work eight, ten fucking hours?
Watching everything you do?
Everything you say, man?
Do you know I eat octopus three times a day?
I got fucking octopus coming out of my fucking ears.
I got the fuckin 'Russian shoes my feet' s comin' through.
What, you want me to stay there and do nothing?
I' m no fuckin 'criminal, man.
I' m no puta or thief.
I' m Tony Montana, a political prisoner from Cuba.
- And I want my fuckin 'human rights, now!
Just like the President Jimmy Carter says.
Carter should see this human right.
He' s really good.
- What do you say, Harry?
- I don' t believe a word of this shit!
They all sound the same to me.
That son of a bitch Castro is shittin 'all over us.
Send this bastard to Freedomtown.
Let them take a look at him.
- Get him outta here.
- You know somethin '?
You can send me anywhere.
Here, there, this, that; it don' t matter.
- There' s nothing you can do to me that Castro has not done.
- [Tony]
What' d you tell him?
I told him what you told me.
Told 'em we were -- I was in sanitation.
They didn' t go for it.
- Sanitation?
I told you to tell 'em you was in a sanitarium, not sanitation.
- Sanitarium.
- You didn' t tell me that.
No, I told you to say you had T. B. and you was in a sanitarium.
You was cured.
- Come on.
They' d have thought you was a horse and let you out.
/ Vamos a la bailar / / Esta noche / / Vamos acostar / / Hasta la mañana / // [Woman Continues Singing ln Spanish]
Ven acá, man.
Come here. - ¿Qué te pasa?
I gotta talk to you.
Come on, man.
- So close, man.

- Leave him alone.
- I got better things to do.
You' re chicken, man.
Are you ready for some good news?
Sure.

We can be outta this place in 30 days.
Not only that, but we got a green card and a job in Miami.
Now are we made or are we made, man?
What do we gotta do?
Go to Cuba and hit the beard or what?
- No, man, somebody else.
- You' re kidding?
- You' re not kidding?
Guy named Rebenga, man.
Emilio Rebenga.
Rebenga?
I know that name.
- Yeah?
- He' s political.
- Yeah.
Well, he' s coming in here today, man.
This guy, man, was one of the top dogs for Fidel in the early days.
But Castro felt like he couldn' t trust him anymore and threw him in jail.
But while he was on top, he tortured a few guys to death.
And one of the guy' s brother is a rich guy in Miami now, and he wants the favor repaid.
That' s where we come in.
He' s ugly, man.
[Laughs]
You tell your guys in Miami -- your friend -- it' d be a pleasure.
I kill a Communist for fun, but for a green card, I gonna carve him up real nice.
[People Shouting]
¡Libertad!
From a friend you fucked!
That face.
- That doesn' t look like me.
- Hey, that looks pretty, man.
¡Coño!
Your big shot friend better come up with something soon.
I didn' t come to the United States to break my fuckin 'back.
- Hey, he' s coming, okay?
What do you want from me? - ¡Coño!
I told you --
- Qué le pasa a este hombre ahora?
What' s wrong?
Jamón.
[Shouting ln Spanish, lndistinct]
Look at that one.
That one right there in the pink.
Look at those titties.
Look at that punk with her.
What' s he got that I don' t have?
Well, he' s very handsome, for one thing, you know?
I mean, look at the way he dresses, man.
That' s style.
And a little coke money doesn' t hurt nobody.
¡Coño!
Fuckin 'onions.
They oughta be pickin 'gold from the street.
Hey, there' s two guys looking for you out there.
Uno grande y uno pequen' o.

We' ve got a lot of work to do, so -- // [Salsa]
This is my friend, Tony Montana, I' ve been telling you about.
- I got something for you.
Yeah?
What do we gotta do?
Gotta unload a boat.
You get 500 each.
Eh?
That' s great, eh?
- You gotta be kidding.
Five hundred?
Baggage handlers?
The going rate on a boat is a thousand a night.
You know that.
First you gotta work your way up to 500.
After what I did for you guys in Freedomtown?
That Rebenga hit was a game of dominoes?
- That was something else.
- Shut up!
What' s with this dishwasher, chico?
Don' t he think we could' ve got some other space cadet to hit Rebenga cheaper?
Fifty bucks.
Then why didn' t you?
And don' t be callin 'me no fuckin' dishwasher, or I' il kick your monkey ass --
- You can' t do that, man!

Okay, okay -- All right, big man!
You wanna make some big bucks?
Let' s see how tough you are.
You know something about cocaine?

They say they got two keys for us for openers.
Pure coke.
Hotel in Miami Beach.
I want you to go over there.
And if it' s what they say it is, you pay 'em and bring it back.
You do that, you got five grand.
Go, pay 'em, bring it back, yeah?
You know how to handle a machine gun?
We were in the army.
- You gonna need a couple other guys.
- That' s no problem.
You get the buy money then.
And, chico, if anything happens to that buy money -- ¡y pobreci --! my boss is gonna stick your heads up your asses faster than a rabbit gets fucked!
I' m scared.
- Man, you' re pushing your luck.
- Don' t worry.
- That was dumb.
- Mi hijo, you worry too much.
You' re gonna have a heart attack.
You act like that guy' s doing you a favor or somethin '.
- What' s this with the Colombians?
- What does it matter?
What does it -- He says Colombians, and you make these eyes --
I don' t like fuckin 'Colombians!
Hey, hey, what you guys doing?
There' s a lot of dishes to be washed.
Wash 'em yourself, man.

No problem.
Hello.
This is Marta.
Marta, hello.
I am Hector.
And I am Tony.
So, Omar says you' re okay.
Yeah?
Good.
So, you got the money?
You got the stuff?
Sure I have the stuff, but I don' t have it right here with me now.
I got it close by.
Well, I don' t have the money either, man.
I have it close by too.
Where? ln the car?
- No, not in the car, man.
How 'bout you?
Where you have your stuff?
- Not far.
We start over again?
Where you from, Tony?
What the fuck difference does it make where I' m from, man?
Take it easy, man.
I, uh -- I just want to get to know who I do business with.
You' il get to know me once you start doing business with me and stop fucking around, Hector.
- Okay?
- [Tony]
What' s the story?
You know, frog face, you just fucked yourself.
- You steal from me, you' re dead.
You want to give me the cash... or do I kill your brother first, before I kill you?
Why don' t you try sticking your head up your ass?
Yeah?
Okay.

I am takin 'it to López myself.
Not you, me.
This fuckin 'guy.
Frank López.
Tony Montana.
- Hey, Tony Montana.
- Mr. López.
It' s a real pleasure.
You can call me Frank.
Everybody calls me Frank.
My Little League team.
Even the fucking prosecutors around town, they all call me Frank.
- Okay, Frank.
- How are you?
- Manny Ribera.
- He caught one on the job.
- Went right through.
We heard about that.
Omar, he tells me great things about you guys.
Yeah, well, Omar' s okay.
Not to mention, of course, the nice job you did for me.
- That Commie son of a bitch -- - Well, you don' t have to mention that.
- That was fun.
- That was fun?
- Damn right.
That was fun.
- [Chuckling]
Hey, what do you want to drink?
Scotch, gin, rum?
- Gin is fine.
Two gins.
- Gin, gin, gin.
Hey, I need a guy with steel in his balls, Tony.
And I need him around me all the time.
You, Tony and your compadre here.
Here' s the stuff.
Two keys.
It cost my friend Angel his life.
Here' s your money.
My gift to you.
I' m sorry about your friend, Tony.
lf people would do business the right way, there' d be no fuck- ups like this.
Don' t think I don' t appreciate the gesture.
You' re gonna find you stay loyal in this business, you' re gonna move up.
Then you' re gonna find out your biggest problem is not bringing in the stuff, but what to do with all the fucking cash!
I hope I have that problem some day.
You' re gonna have that problem, don' t worry.
Sit over here.
Where the hell' s Elvira already?
Go find her, will you?
Fucking broad.
She spends half her life dressing, the other half, undressing.
- Gotta get her in between.
She' s coming.
You gotta jump on her when she' s not looking.
- That' s the best time.
What are you guys doing tonight?
You wanna go to a nice restaurant with me?
I could eat a horse.
- Okay, they' re gonna cook you a horse.
- I' il eat it.
Well, tell me, where' d they get you?
Right there in the side?
It went right through me.
It hit the wall.
I ran out of bullets like an asshole, and when I' m changing the clip, the guy who I thought I killed but was not dead, shot me.
The guy was behind me.
- Bullets?
One bullet, nine millimeter.
Elvira, where the hell you been?
It' s 10: 00.
You' re always hungry.
You should try starving.
Come on.
Come on.
Tony Montana.
- Hello.
- Manny Ribera.
So, there are five of us.
Where are we having dinner?
I thought we' d go to the Babylon Club.
- Again?
You know, Frank, if anyone ever wanted to assassinate you, you wouldn' t be too hard to find.
Assassinate me?
Who the hell would want to kill me?
I got nothing but friends!
You never know, do you?
Maybe the catcher on your Little League team.
The catcher?
That son of a bitch, he didn' t get a base hit all season.
I should kill him!
You know who that is?
Luis and Miguel Echeverría.
They got the biggest distribution setup from here to Houston,
Tucson, all down that way.
What do you think of that, huh?
Look.
You see that fat bastard?
That' s Nacho Contreras.
El Gordo!
He' s got more cash than anybody in this place.
He' s a real chazzer!
You -- You know what a chazzer is?
What is a chazzer?
It' s a Yiddish word for "pig."
See, the guy, he wants more than what he needs.
He don' t fly straight no more.
So, it comes down to one thing, Tony boy, and you never forget.
Lesson number one:
Don' t underestimate... the other guy' s greed!
Lesson number two:
Don' t get high on your own supply.
That' s right.
Lesson number two:
Don' t get high on your own supply.
'Course not everybody follows the rules, huh?
Your champagne, Mr. López.
- That is' 64?
- The best, Mr. López.
Okay.
Omar, you pour it, and you bring another bottle right away, will you?
$550 for this bottle, Tony.
What do you think of that?
- That' s pretty good.
- For a bunch of fucking grapes.
So, here' s to old friends and to new friends.
How you like it, Tony?
- Oh, that' s good, Frank.
- Like you say, man.
- [Laughing]
Hey, I' m gonna get you new clothes too.
I' m gonna get you $550 suits... so you look real sharp.
'Cause I want you to work for me.
I want you and your boys to work with Omar here.
We are going to do something -- something big next month.
We are running a string of mules from Colombia.
You do good on that, there' il be some other things.
- That sounds like fun to me, Frank.
You want a cigar?
So, you wanna dance, Frank, or you wanna sit here and have a heart attack?
Me dance?
Hey, I think I want to have a heart attack instead.
- Well, don' t foam into the Donnie P.
How about you?
You want me to dance?
Yeah, sure, go on, Tony.
Have some fun.
What do you think of him?
- I think he' s a fucking peasant!
But you get a guy like that on your side, he breaks his back for you.
- What' s your name?
- What?
What' s your name?
- Hancock.
- What?
Sounds like a bird.
Hancock.
Flyin 'around.
Where you from?
- Baltimore.
- What?
- Baltimore?
- Where' s that?
- Look, it doesn' t really matter, all right!
I' m just trying to be friendly, you know?
Especially one who got off a banana boat.
Banana boat?
You got the wrong guy.
I don' t come off no banana boat.
You' re thinkin 'of someone else maybe.
Aren' t you part of the Cuban crime wave?
What you talking crazy for?
I' m a political refugee here.
So take it easy.
Don' t talk crazy.
I didn' t know you were so sensitive about your diplomatic status.
What is your problem, baby?
You got a beautiful body, beautiful legs, a beautiful face, all these guys in love with you.
Only you got a look in your eye like you haven' t been fucked in a year!
Hey, José, who, why, when and how I fuck is none of your business, okay?
Now you' re talking to me, baby.
That I like.
Keep it coming.
Don' t call me "baby"!
I' m not your baby.
Not yet, but you gotta give me some time.
Even if I were blind, desperate, starved and begging for it on a desert island, you' d be the last thing I' d ever fuck.
That chick he' s with --
- Yeah?
- She like me.
Oh, she like you, huh?
How do you know?
The eyes, chico.
They never lie.
What, are you serious?
What do you think?
- Man, that' s the boss' s lady, okay?
- You' re gonna get us killed.
- Fuck you, man.
The boss' s lady.
That guy' s soft.
Look in his face.
The booze and the cuncha tell him what to do.
Don' t fuckin 'go crazy on me, okay?
Just remember last year at this time we were in a fucking cage, okay?
You remember.
I' d like to forget that.
I say be happy with what you got.
You be happy.
- Me, I want what' s coming to me.
- What' s coming to you?
The world, chico, and everything in it.
This is paradise.
This is paradise, I' m telling you.
- This town like a great big pussy just waitin 'to get fucked.
I shoulda come here ten years ago.
I' d have been a millionaire by this time.
- Mmm. - my own golf course.
You know what I want?
I thought of this the other day.
A line of blue jeans, right?
With my name written on the back of chicks' asses.
How that?
That sound completely crazy to me, man.
Look at that.
Look, look.
That' s what you' re doing.
We' re missing the action here.
You wanna have some ice cream with my friend and me?
Get lost, greaseball!
- Look at that.
- lce cream?
- That' s right.
- You said ice cream?
- Girls like ice cream.
That' s not gonna work.
I' m telling you.
You know how you pick up chicks in this country?
- What the fuck was that, what you just did?
- That' s what you do.
That is disgusting.
- Watch.
Look like a lizard.
Like a bug coming out of your mouth.
That figures you wouldn' t understand.
But the women in this country, when you do that, they know.
- They know what?
- They understand.
They -- They go crazy.
It' il take a lot of practice, but you gotta learn, because women love when you suck the pussy.
She lookin 'at us.
You think you can do it with her?
- I think I can.
- You wanna try it with her?
- Why not?
- You gonna watch me?
- I' m lookin 'at you.
- You' re not gonna do it.
- Watch this.
I' m with you, man.
I' m gonna get her.
Do your thing.
- Just be quiet.
- Romeo!
You' re looking very pretty today.
I' ve been watching you from over there.
You wanna see something funny?
Hey, take a look over there.
I gotta sit down here.
I gotta watch my friend.
He gonna stick his tongue out to that girl.
- Look at that. ¡Ay, coño!
- You' re sick!
You see what happened to him?
- You know, if I wasn' t a nice guy, I' d crack you.
- She' s too big for you.
- Causing trouble like that.
Come on.
- What I try to tell you?
- Lesbian!
What I try to tell you?
This country, you gotta make the money first.
Then when you get the money, you get the power.
Then when you get the power, then you get the woman.
That' s why you gotta make your own moves.
That' s the one I rented.
They -- They -- That' s her, man.
There she is.
- 'Bout time.
Frank got held up at the golf course.
Uh, he said he' d meet us at the track later.
He said to bet on lce Cream in the first, by the way.
ln that thing?
You must be kidding.
What you talkin 'about?
That' s a Cadillac.
- I wouldn' t be caught dead in that thing.
- Aw, come on.
- But it' s a cream puff.
It looks like somebody' s nightmare.
So, you like this better?
- Tigers, no?
Crazy guy.
You know what he' s been doin '?
Dragging me to the zoo to look at tigers.
He says he' s gonna buy one now.
You do that, and you' re not gonna have any friends left.
- Not that you have any now -- - You' re gonna like that tiger, man.
You gonna drive around with a tiger in your passenger seat?
Maybe.
Some lady tiger.
- How much?
- 43, 000, fully equipped.
- That all?
- Machine gun turrets are extra.
He' s a funny guy.
Come here, Manny.
Bullet- proof this, okay?
And this here and here.
- And the windows.
- And get me one of them phones, you know, with a scrambler.
- And a scrambler.
And a radio with scanners, to pick out flying saucers, stuff like that.
- Don' t forget the fog lights.
ln case I get caught in the swamp.
That' s a good idea.
I' m tryin 'to drive here!
I thought you were taking me to Frank.
We got an hour.
You hungry?
No, but I' m bored.
Well, that figures.
- Hey, check it out, Manny, okay?
And pay the guy.
- Yeah.
Meet me at the track, okay?
- Good doin 'business with you.
I wouldn' t buy the car if you didn' t like it.
Plannin 'on driving the girls crazy, aren' t you, Tony?
You know who?
And what would Frank say?
I like Frank, you know?
Only I like you better.
- You got some for me?
Don' t get confused, Tony.
I don' t fuck around with the help.
You wanna play that way with me, I play with you.
Shit.
- Would you kiss me if I wear the hat?
Playtime is over, okay?
Mamá.
Long time.
No postcards from jail?
Gina.
Tony?
- Oh, man, look at you.
Hey, you' re beautiful.
- I didn' t -- - Mamá, look at those eyes, huh?
- [Chuckles]
You know the last time I saw you, you was like that.
You looked like a little boy.
Uh, I got something for you.
This no big deal.
I never thought I' d see you again, you know?
You think they' re gonna keep a guy like me down?
Well, no.
Look.
You open that up.
- For me?
- I think so.
It' s nothing much, you know.
Do you see what' s written on the back?
On the back?
[Sighs]
- "Always."
- "Always." It' s beautiful, Tony!
So Mamá is still working in the factory, and I' m working part- time in a beauty parlor.
I' m doing hair, Tony.
Do you remember Hiram González?
His father owned that barbershop.
It' s his place.
Plus I go to junior college.
Miami Dade.
And in two more years, I get my cosmetology license.
- And then I' il be making enough money -- - Surprise!
All that' s over... starting today.
- My kid sister don' t have to work in no beauty parlor, and Mamá, she don' t have to sew in no factory.
Your son made it, Mamá.
He' s a success.
That' s why I didn' t come around before.
I want you to see what a good boy I been.
Here' s a thousand dollars.
For you, Mamá.
- Who did you kill for this, Antonio?
I didn' t kill nobody, Mamá.
- No?
What are you doing now?
Banks, or is it still bodegas, you and the others?
No!
Things are different now.
I' m working with an anti- Castro group.
I' m an organizer now, and I get a lot of political contributions.
Sure you do.
A gun sticking in somebody' s face is how.
You know, all we hear about in the papers... is animals like you and the killings.
It' s Cubans like you who are giving a bad name to our people.
People who come here, work hard and make a good name for themselves.
- People who send their children to school -- - Mamá!
What are you saying?
- That' s your son!
- I wish I had one.
- No.
He was a bum then, and he' s a bum now.
Who do you think you are, hmm?
You suddenly show up here, throw some money around... and think you can get my respect.
- You think you can buy me with jewelry?
You think you can come into my house with your hotshot clothes... and your jail manners and make fun of us?
- Mamá, you don' t know what you' re talking about.
- That' s not the way I am!
That is not the way I raised Gina to be!
You are not going to destroy her.
I don' t need your money.
I work for my living.
I don' t want you in this house anymore!
I don' t want you around Gina.
So, come on.
Get out!
Mamá -- - And take this lousy money with you.
- It stinks.
Why do you have to spoil it for everybody, huh?
I' m sorry, Tony.
Oh, no, no.
Tony, wait a minute!
- Gina, stay here!
- [Gina]
No, no, no, Mamá -- - [Mamá]
- Tony, wait, please!
I' m sorry.
I don' t know, Mamá -- Ever since Papá left she' s --
Forget Papá.
I know you did some bad things back then.
ln the army, I know you got into some trouble.
The Communists, they' re always trying to tell you what to do.
- Mamá doesn' t understand that.
- I know.
I just want you to know, you know, I don' t care.
It doesn' t matter to me how long you' ve been away, five or ten years.
You' re my blood, always.
I know.
Come on.
- I gotta go back in.
Please.
- You need this.
- What am I gonna tell her?
- Take that.
You don' t tell her anything.
Don' t tell her I give it to you, but give her some from time to time.
And listen, you go out yourself, you know?
Go ahead, go out, do some things.
Have some fun.
You gotta get some fun out of life.
You gonna beat yourself to death at 19?
Pussycat like you?
- I' il talk to you again, all right?
- Okay.
- Put that money away.
- I' il talk to her.
- [Train Whistle Blowing]
Okay, let' s go.
She' s beautiful.
- How come you -- - Hey!
Stay away from her, man.
You hear?
- She not for you.
So this and my other factory, I can guarantee production... of 200 kilos refined every month of the year.
The problem is I have no steady market.
Basically, what I' m looking for is somebody in the States... who can share the risk with me, somebody who can guarantee to buy from me, say, 150 kilos a month.
That' s a big commitment, Mr. Sosa.
Something like that, uh --
It' s too bad Frank' s not here.
You should talk to him.
- He would like to come, but with his trial coming up, it' s hard for him to get out of the country.
- So he sent you instead?
- Yeah, something like that.
We' il talk at my house, shall we?
You got good stuff here.
Class' A 'shit.
So this López guarantees to buy from me 150 kilos every month of the year.
He picks it up here.
I can sell it to him for as little as, uh... 7, 000 a key.
You cannot do better than that.
Yeah, but then we gotta take the risk of moving it.
Also, we' il be cutting out the Colombians.
That means we have to go to war with them.
We cut out the Colombians, we take risks on both sides.
Why don' t we split the risk?
We take it from there.
Panama is risky.
It costs me more.
Panama I can sell for... 13. 5 a key.
13. 5?
What, are you nuts?
We still gotta take that shit to Florida, man.
Do you know what that' s like these days?
You got the fucking navy.
You got EC- 2s with the satellite- tracking shit.
You got the fucking Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass.
We' re losing one out of every nine loads.
That' s no duck walk anymore, man, let me tell you.
Forget about 13. 5.
- Well, what do you suggest that is reasonable?
Excuse me one moment.
Hey, Montana, what the fuck' s the matter with you?
- You negotiating for Frank López, huh?
- Don' t worry about it.
- Take it easy.
- I' m not worried about it.
You should worry about it. lf he wants to make a deal, it' s up to him, not you.
That' s it.
- Fuck you.
How' s that?
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.
You need to open your eyes and keep your mouth shut.
Let it go at that.
- Don' t worry about it.
Your head is in the wrong place.
You got to watch out for yourself.
Why don' t you talk to him about it?
You think he wants to give you the money?
- Shut the fuck up.
- I' m doing the talking here, not you.
You' re here to watch my back.
That' s easier to watch.
Close your mouth.
I can' t wait to see what Frank' s gonna react to this one.
Just shut up.
- Now where were we?
- Panama.
You' re looking for a partner, right?
Something like that.
Look, Mr. Sosa, we' re getting ahead of ourselves here.
I am down on Frank' s authority to buy 200 keys, that' s it.
I got no right --
- Nobody got no right to negotiate for Frank -- - Let the man finish, okay?
Let him propose a proposition; then we can talk more.
You got no authority here.
I started you in this fucking business, so shut the fuck up.
- Frank is gonna love it.
- That' s up to Frank, not you!
I' m sorry about this, Mr. Sosa.
No, it is all right.
You' re right.
Maybe you should talk to Frank.
Well, good.
I don' t think it' s something I wanna do on an overseas phone.
But as soon as I get back to Miami, I will talk to Frank personally.
Good.
My chopper can take you to Santa Cruz.
I have a jet there, can have you in Miami in five hours.
You should be back here tomorrow in time for lunch.
Good.
Good talking to you.
Why don' t you leave your friend here?
While you are gone, maybe he can tell me how to run my business.
- I think Frank would like to see him -- - No, that' s okay.
You tell Frank I keeping this guy on ice for him.
- [Chuckling]
Let' s finish our lunch.
I have to hand it to you, Mr. Sosa.
You got everything a man could want.
I like you, Tony.
There is no lying in you.
Unfortunately, I do not feel the same about the rest of your organization.
What do you mean by that, Mr. Sosa?
I' m talking about Omar Suárez.
from several years ago in New York.
He was an informer for the police.
He put Vito Duval and the Ramos brothers, Nello and Gino, away for life.
So how do I know you' re not a chivato too, Tony?
Let' s get this straight now.
I never fucked anybody over in my life didn' t have it comin 'to him.
You got that?
All I have in this life is my balls and my word, and I don' t break 'em for no one, you understand?
That piece of shit up there, I never like him, I never trusted him.
For all I know, he had me set up and had my friend, Ángel Fernández, killed.
I' m here, he' s not.
You wanna go on with me, say it.
You don' t, then you make a move.
I think you speak from the heart, Montana.
But I say to myself, this López, your boss, he had chivatos like that working for him.
His judgment stinks.
So I think to myself, how many other mistakes has this López guy made?
How can I trust his organization?
You tell me, Tony.
Frank is smart, you know?
You can' t blame him for that animal.
It' s a crazy business we' re in, you know?
That could happen to anyone, even you.
Why don' t I go back and talk to Frank... and work it out?
I fix things between us.
You got my word on it.
I think you and me, we can work this thing out, we do business together a long time.
Just remember -- I' il only tell you one time -- don' t fuck me, Tony.
Don' t you ever try to fuck me.
You what?
You made a deal for a fucking $18 million... without even checking with me?
Are you crazy, Montana?
- Coño, Frank.
Take it easy. - ¡Coño, my ass!
At 10. 5 a key, it' s puro.
You can' t lose money.
We make 75 million on this deal, Frank.
Seventy- five million.
That is serious money.
What the fuck is Sosa going to do when I don' t come up with the first five million?
What is he gonna do?
ls he gonna send me a bill?
He' s gonna send a fucking hit squad up here!
Relax!
Take it easy.
I' m in tight with Sosa.
You short a couple of mil, I go on the street for you.
I make a couple of moves, a mil here, a mil there, you got it.
Oh, you' ve been making moves on your own, huh?
I got ears, you know?
What do you hear about Echevierra and the Díaz brothers?
What about Gaspar Gómez?
What is he gonna do when you start moving 2, 000 keys --
Fuck Gaspar Gómez and fuck the fucking Díaz brothers!
Fuck 'em all!
I bury those cockroaches!
What they ever do for us?
Look, Frank, the time has come.
The whole operation.
Distribution.
New York, Chicago, L. A.
We gotta set our own mark and enforce it.
We gotta think big now.
Think big.
Like your friend Sosa.
Let me tell you something about that greaseball cocksucker.
He is a snake, that' s what he is.
You turn your back on him, he' il stick it in.
You don' t trust a guy like that.
Omar was a stoolie because Sosa said so?
You bought that line.
Maybe I made a mistake sending you down there.
Maybe you and Sosa know something I don' t know.
Like what?
Like what?
You tell me like what?
You calling me a liar, Frank?
That what you calling me?
Let' s just say I want things to stay the way they are for now.
You stall your deal with Sosa.
Stall him?
Okay, boss.
Come on.
I am the boss.
- Sure, you' re the boss.
- Hey, Tony.
low- key, quiet.
And the guys who want it all -- chicas, champagne, flash -- they don' t last.
You finished?
Can I go now?
Hi there.
You just missed Frank.
Oh, yeah?
Only I didn' t come to see Frank.
This is not the time or the place, Tony.
- Next time, make an appointment first.
I got something important I want to talk to you about.
So why don' t we have a couple of drinks, act normal... and just take it easy, huh?
Come on.
- Sure.
- Okay.
I won' t bite you.
We' re all normal here.
I heard you and Frank aren' t working together anymore.
That' s right.
I think it' s easier, don' t you?
Makes things easier.
Well, uh -- Thank you.
Here' s to the land of opportunity.
For you, maybe.
- You like kids?
You know, kid.
Little kids.
Sure.
Why not?
As long as there' s a nurse.
Good, 'cause I like kids too.
I like 'em.
Don' t matter to me.
Look, Frank' s gonna be back any minute.
Come here.
Sit here.
I want to talk to you.
Sit down.
I' m not gonna bite you.
Okay, here' s the story.
I know that.
I got no education, but that' s okay.
I know the street, and I' m making all the right connections.
With the right woman, there' s no stopping me.
I could go right to the top.
Anyway, what I got to tell you is this:
I like you.
I like you the first time I laid eyes on you.
I say, "She' s a tiger.
She belong to me. "
I want you to marry me.
I want you to be the mother of my children.
Marry you?
That' s right.
What about Frank, Tony?
What are you gonna do about Frank?
Frank is not gonna last, okay?
He' s finished.
Just think about it, okay?
I want you to really think about it.
I go now.
Take care.
- All your enemies are gone.
- How are you?
- Hello, boss.
What the fuck she doin 'here?
She' s just dancing.
Come on.
I mean, it' s just a disco.
- Who that guy she with?
He' s some guy who works for Lugo.
He' s nobody.
- He' s harmless.
- Works for Lugo?
He' s -- Forget him.
Hello, Tony.
Well, you remember me.
Mel Bernstein, right?
Chief detective, narcotics.
I think we should talk.
Talk?
What are we going to talk about?
Not lately.
No, not lately.
What about ancient history, like Emilio Rebenga?
Or a bunch of whacked- out lndians at the Sun Ray Motel?
Mel, who' s ever giving you your information is taking you for a long ride.
Tony, baby, we gonna talk, or am I gonna bust your wise- ass spic balls here and now?
Keep your eye on her.
- I' il do that.
- My office.
The word on the street is you' re bringing in a lot of yeyo.
You' re public property now.
Supreme Court says your privacy can be invaded.
Okay.
How much?
Well, there' s an answer to that too.
Here' s how much.
- Big number.
- Yeah!
That' s on a monthly basis, same thing every month.
You know how this works?
No.
We tell you who' s moving against you, and we shake down who you want shaken down.
Let' s say that you got a real problem making a collection.
And then we step in for you.
Got eight killers with badges working for me.
When they hit, it hurts.
Same thing works the other way.
You feed me a bust now and then -- some cowboy setting himself up in business.
Small- fry, you know?
We like snacks.
How do I know you' re the last cop I' m gonna have to grease?
What about Fort Lauderdale?
Metro?
How do I know what rock they' re gonna crawl out from under?
Well, it' s not my business, Tony, you know?
We don' t cross no lines.
Listen, you think I want this conversation... going any farther than this table?
My guys got families.
They' re legitimate cops.
I don' t wanna see them embarrassed.
lf they' re embarrassed, they' re gonna suffer.
lf they suffer, they' re gonna make you suffer.
You understand what I' m talking about?
Thank you for the drink.
I got a vacation coming up.
I' m gonna take the wife to London, England.
We' ve never been there.
So, throw in a couple of round- trip tickets, first class, okay?
You oughta smile more, Tony.
You gotta enjoy yourself.
Every day above ground is a good day.
Hello.
Now that' s the idea.
Okay, Mel.
You think about what I said?
About the kids?
- You know, you are really nuts.
- I' m nuts about you.
Hey, Tony, why don' t you find your own girl?
- My own girl?
- That' s what I' m doing.
- Go do it somewhere else.
Maybe I don' t hear so good sometime.
- You' re not going to be hearing anything if you go on.
- You gonna do something?
You' re fucking right I' m going to do something!
I' m giving you orders.
Blow!
You giving me orders?
You got that?
[Tony]
Let' s go.
Elvira.
When you gonna learn?
Looking good, honey.
Keep up the bad work.
- That cocksucker.
- What happened?
- He put that prick Bernstein on me.
- Who?
- How do you know?
- Who else knew about Rebenga?
Omar?
- [Laughing]
He' s letting me know he' s got weight on me.
I' il tell you what, man.
[Continues, Muffled]
Wait.
/ I' m wound up like a spring and I' m ready to fight / / I' m hot tonight /
- Welcome to my private room.
- Your private room.
- This is my private room, huh?
I got a beautiful, nice, white lounge -- barcalounge chair for you. / Hey, hey, hey //
Oh, Gina, you taste so muy bueno.
- What are you doing?
[Shrieking]
We wasn' t doing nothing!
- Fernando, wait!
- [Shouting]
- Get out!
- What, you think he' s cute?
I saw him putting his hand all over your ass.
My kid sister in the toilet.
- It' s none of your business.
The fuck it ain' t!
You can' t tell me what to do!
I' m telling you what to do!
Listen to me.
I catch you here again, I' m gonna wipe you all over the fucking place.
Oh, yeah?
Go ahead!
Do it now.
I wanna see it.
- I wanna see it now, big shot.
- Don' t push me, baby.
- Don' t fucking push me!
Get the fuck outta here!
- Go outside -- - Got some nerve!
- You think you can come in here and tell me what to do?
You can' t tell me what to do.
I am not a baby anymore.
I' il do what I wanna do, see whoever I wanna see.
And if I wanna fuck 'em, then I' il fuck' em!
Come on, man.
- [Sobbing]
- What the fuck you want?
You want something?
No.
Don' t touch me.
- Gina, have a seat.
No.
I don' t wanna go out there.
- Another great night here at the Babylon, right?
- [Rim Shot]
All right!
- Do another gram, you' il all be babbling on.
ls that coke in your bra, or are you just glad to see me?
A little bit of hope, I' m sure, yes.
I was a little depressed when I got up this morning.
- I had a dry dream, but -- - [Audience Laughing]
I do Laurel & Hardy in Spanish too. - ¿Qué pasó, amigo?
That' s the height of culture, I can assure you.
But my favorite Cuban of all time has to be Ricky Ricardo.
Mr. Babaloo himself.
He had the same problem for ten years.
Lucy, don' t come down to the club.
He' s your brother.
He loves you.
That' s why he did it.
All right?
He cares about you.
- To him, you' re still his little sister -- - Right!
That' s the problem.
He still treats me like I' m a baby.
I' m 20 years old now.
- I' m not anybody' s baby.
Come on, Gina.
Put yourself in his place, okay?
Right now, you happen to be the best thing in his life.
The only thing that' s any good, that' s pure.
So, of course he doesn' t want you mixing with those people, growing up to be like him.
He has this father thing for you.
He feels like he has to protect you.
Protect me against what?
Against guys like that asshole that you were dancing with tonight.
Hey, I like Fernando.
He' s a fun guy and he' s nice.
All right?
He knows how to treat a woman?
By taking you to the toilet to make out?
Calm down.
I got a special treat for you.
Here' s a guy I found strolling in the jungle.
He' s unlike anything you' il ever see in your life.
Give a warm Babylon welcome to the one and only Octavio!
Look around.
Go out with, with somebody... who' s got something on the ball, who' s going somewhere in life.
Like who?
Like, for instance, someone who' s got a real job, like a banker.
- Or, or a doctor, a lawyer -- - What about you?
- What are you talking about?
- Why don' t you take me out?
- What, are you crazy?
- I see the way you look at me, Manolo.
- What, do you think I' m blind?
- Come on.
- What?
- Look, Gina,
Tony and I are like brothers, all right?
- And you' re his kid sister, and that' s where it ends.
- That' s where it stays.
- What, are you afraid of Tony?
- You afraid of Tony' s kid sister?
- I' m not afraid of anybody!
That' s not the point here!
- It' s not for me.
Don' t look at me.
How do you know?
- 'Cause I' m not here.
Oh, really?
- Shit, you' re weird.
- I' m weird?
- Hello?
Hello, Miriam?
- Hey, Tony!
- Put Manny on, okay?
Just a second.
It' s Tony.
What are you doing, checking up on me?
Get your clothes on and meet me in front of López Motors in 45 minutes.
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing we can' t face.
I' il -- I' il be there.
- You' re still on the phone.
Let' s go.
- Take it easy, okay?
- I' m leaving now.
- [Receiver Clicks]
- Uh, Nick?
- Yeah, Tony.
This is what I want you to do for me:
- Call him at his office at 3: 00 sharp, okay?
- Okay.
"We fucked up, he got away."
- Okay.
- You got it?
What are you going to say?
We fucked up.
- What time?
- 3: 00, sharp.
Listen, go down to the ball game tonight?
I couldn' t make it.
I got things -- I' il tell you about 'em.
You' re kidding?
What was the score?
Three to two?
Hey, Mel, guess what?
My Little League team, the Little Lopezers, they won the division tonight.
- That' s great.
That' s great.
What' d you do, fix the umpire, Frank?
Christ.
Tony, what happened to you?
They wanted to spoil my $800 suit.
Who the fuck did this, huh?
I don' t know.
Somebody must' ve brought 'em in.
I' ve never seen 'em before.
Hello, Mel.
Got an answer to this too?
- There always is, Tony.
- I' il bet it was the Díaz brothers.
They got a beef going back to the Sun Ray thing.
Maybe you' re right, you know?
Anyway, l- I' m glad you made it, Tony.
We' il return the favor for you, in spades.
No, I take care of this myself.
What is the gun for, Tony?
What, this?
It' s nothing.
I, uh -- How do you say?
- [Ringing Continues]
It must be Elvira.
She... got mad after we left the club.
I tell her you' re not here, okay?
No, it' s all right.
Hello.
I' m gonna be home in an hour.
Don' t worry.
Hey, Frank, you' re a piece of shit.
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I' m talking about, you fucking cockroach.
What are you talking about?
Listen to me, huh?
You know what a chazzer is, Frank?
That' s a pig that don' t fly straight.
Neither do you, Frank.
Hey, Tony, why the fuck would I hurt you?
I brought you in.
So we had a few differences, huh?
I gave you your start.
I was the one who believed in you.
I stayed loyal to you.
I made what I could on the side, but I never turned you, Frank!
Never!
But you --
A man who ain' t got his word is a cockroach.
Mel, come on.
Do something, will you?
It' s your tree, Frank.
You' re sitting in it.
All right, Tony.
I was the one.
Please, give me a second chance.
Will you, will you do that?
You give me a second chance, I give you ten million dollars.
Okay?
Ten million dollars.
I got it in a vault over there in Spain, Tony.
We go over there; we get on a plane, and it' s yours.
Okay?
All of it.
Ten million dollars.
Okay, Tony?
Please, Tony?
Elvira?
You want Elvira!
I go away.
I' m gonna disappear.
You' il never see me again.
Please, Tony, I don' t want to die.
I never did nothing to nobody.
No, no, you never did nothing to nobody.
- You had somebody else do it for you.
- Tony, I am begging you --
Get up now!
God!
Tony, no, don' t kill me, please.
- I won' t kill you.
- Oh, Christ, thank you.
- Get off my foot.
- Thank you.
- Manolo, shoot that piece of shit!
Every dog has his day, huh, Mel?
He wouldn' t listen.
He got hot tonight, about the broad, you know?
He fucked up.
You fucked up.
Don' t go too far, Tony.
I' m not, Mel.
You are.
You can' t shoot a cop!
Whoever says you was one?
Wait a minute!
I' il fix this up.
Sure, Mel.
Maybe you can hand yourself... one of them first- class tickets to the Resurrection.
Son of a bitch!
- So long, Mel.
Have a good trip.
- Fuck you!
- Okay, come on.
- What about Ernie?
You want a job, Ernie?
- Sure, Tony.
- Okay, then you call me tomorrow.
Hey, man, you got a job!
Thanks.
God, what' s happened?
Where' s Frank?
Get your stuff.
You' re coming with me.
/ Hit the wheel and double the stakes / / Throttle wide open like a bat out of hell / / You crash the gate / / Crash the gate / / Goin 'for the back of beyond / / Nothing' s gonna stop you There' s nothing that strong / / So close now You' re nearly at the brink / / So push it Oooh, yeah /
So you come to me with some kind of thing.
Okay.
You propose it, I talk to you.
[Clears Throat]
But we got a problem, you know?
I' m bringing in twice as much as I ever did before.
Come on.
That' s serious money, you know?
- You bank boys gotta come down a bit.
- That' s crazy.
We can' t do that.
- Then that' s too bad.
- What am I gonna do?
- Tony, sweetheart, we' re not a wholesale operation.
We' re a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give me, the harder it is for me to rinse.
I didn' t know.
The fact is I can' t take any more of your money... unless I raise the rates on you.
- You gonna raise the r -- - I gotta do it.
- The l. R. S. is coming -- - Don' t give me that shit!
Jerry, talk to me, man.
- I' m talking.
I know the game.
- This is business talk.
Don' t talk to me like that.
The l. R. S. is coming down heavy on south Florida.
There was a Time magazine story that didn' t help.
There' s a recession.
I got stockholders I gotta be responsible for.
- I gotta do it, Tony.
You' re gonna learn from him.
I gotta go 10 percent on the first 12 million in denominations of 20.
I' il go eight percent on your ten- dollar bills and six points on your fives.
- That' s it.
- We' re going somewhere else, okay?
- There' s no place else to go.
It' s not a conspiracy.
- I fly the cash myself to the Bahamas.
- Once maybe.
You gonna trust some monkey in a Bahamian bank... with 20 million of your hard- earned dollars?
Don' t be a schmuck.
Who else can you trust?
That' s why you pay us what you do.
You trust us.
Did you hear that guy?
You gotta listen to him.
Stay with us.
You' re an old and well- liked customer.
You' re in good hands with us.
- And I gotta run.
- I' m safe but poor.
- How' s married life treating you?
- Better than you are.
Say hello to the princess for me, will you?
- She' s beautiful.
- I' il see you.
Take care.
- You too.
That prick!
Fuckin 'WASP whore.
Talkin 'to me like l -- I some maricón come over on a boat.
I tell you what.
We don' t need that smilin 'motherfucker.
We should talk to this Jewish guy, Seidelbaum, okay?
He' s got his own exchange.
He charges four percent at the most.
And he' s connected.
Fuck 'em.
- Mob guys.
Guineas.
I don' t trust 'em.
Did you sweep the house this month?
The cars?
I told you about it.
The $5, 000?
- Look at that.
- [Sniffs]
That cable truck there.
Since when does it take three days to rig a cable?
What?
You been watching it for three days?
The fuckin 'thing has been there for three days?
- What, you think it' s cops, right?
- I don' t know.
Could be the Díaz brothers, come to get me.
I' il check it out, okay?
Then we' re gonna blow that fuckin 'truck back to Colombia!
Come on, come on.
We' re not the only dopers living on the block, okay?
Remember that.
That fucking truck, that could be anybody and anything.
It could be a cable company --
For someone who' s in charge of my security --
Here are the keys to the front door.
Go down there.
Give 'em the fuckin' keys!
- I' m just tryin 'to say something.
- You' re spending a lot of money on this countersurveillance.
- I don' t give a fuck.
It' s already twelve percent of our adjusted gross.
Twelve percent is not peanuts.
I don' t give a fuck!
It makes me sleep good at night.
That' s what counts.
You worry about it.
- I am worried about it.
We' re getting sloppy.
Our thinking, our fuckin 'attitude, you know?
We' re not fuckin 'hungry anymore.
Miami' s changing.
You can see it everywhere.
New construction.
Growth that' s financed by Florida Security Trust.
We' ve been putting your money to work for 75 years building a more prosperous Miami.
- [Tony]
That' s because for 75 years you been fuckin 'everybody.
Somebody should do something about these -- these whores.
I mean, chargin 'me ten points on my money.
They' re gettin 'away with it.
Fuck, there' s no laws anymore.
- Forget it, man.
They been around a thousand years.
They got all the angles figured out.
You know what capitalism is?
True capitalist if ever I met one.
- Uh- oh.
How would you know, bubblehead?
You ever do nothin 'besides get your hair fixed and powder your nose?
Look at it.
You do too much of that shit, you know?
Nothing exceeds like excess.
- You should know that, Tony.
- I should know what?
What should I know?
Why do you have to talk to me like that all the time for?
- Like I gotta know something.
- Let me talk to you.
- Listen to me.
This Seidelbaum.
- What time is it?
- Okay.
- I met with this guy -- - The drug- related violence that' s plagued south Florida...
He' s good for a laugh, this guy. forces one to ask a question:
How, with a small law enforcement budget, can you put a dent... on an estimated $100 billion- a- year business?
It seems at times all you can do is put your finger in the dike and pray.
Put your fingers in a dike?
The only place you can get your fingers in some dyke.
Not by outlawing the substances, but by legalizing and taxing them.
These voices say that will drive out the organized crime element.
I am not one of those voices.
I know that.
But you know why, Vic?
'Cause you got your head up your culo, that' s why.
That fuckin 'guy, he never tells the truth.... splendor of our city at its best.
It' s the fuckin 'bankers, the politicians -- they' re the ones that wanna make coke illegal!
So they can make the fuckin 'money, and they get the fuckin' votes!
They fightin 'the bad guys.
They' re the bad guys!
They fuck anything and anyone --
Can' t you stop saying "fuck" all the time?
Can' t you stop talking about money?
It' s boring, Tony.
Where' s this comin 'from, man?
What' s boring?
- You' re boring.
That' s all I ever hear in this house.
Come on, pelican!
- Frank never talked about money.
That' s' cause he was so smart, you know?
You know what you' re becoming, Tony?
You' re an immigrant spic millionaire... who can' t stop talking about how much money he' s got --
Who you callin 'a spic, you white piece of bread?
Get out of the way of the television!
Why don' t you dig a hole in the garden and bury it?
I work hard for this!
I want you to know that.
Somebody should' ve given it to you.
Oh.
You know what your problem is, pussycat?
What is my problem?
You got nothing to do with your life.
Why don' t you get a job or something, you know?
Do something.
Be a nurse.
Work with blind kids, lepers.
Anything beats lying around all day waitin 'for me to fuck you!
Don' t toot your horn, honey.
You' re not that good.
Oh, no?
Frank was better, huh?
You' re an asshole!
Where you going?
I was kidding!
I was only kidding!
I guess sometimes married life is not all it' s cracked up to be, you know?
- Where you goin '?
- You got a date?
- Yeah.
- What?
- This Seidelbaum thing.
Yeah, it' s all set up.
Yeah, well, you forget it.
I take care of it.
"Stay out of it"?
It' s my deal.
You' re not a negotiator, Manny, you know that.
You like the ladies more than you like the money.
That' s your problem.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I' m your partner, okay?
You' re not gonna trust me with that kind of thing, who you gonna trust?
- Junior partner.
- Bullshit, man.
Hey, don' t talk to me about trust.
You should listen to your wife.
She' s right.
You are an asshole, man!
Come here.
Come here.
Hey!
Who put this thing together?
Me!
Who do I trust?
Me!
Fuck him.
Fuck called me an asshole.
I need that shit.
I don' t need him, and I don' t need her.
I don' t need nobody!
Back then I worked in pictures down in Colombia.
I was in that movie Burn.
You ever see it?
Ah, you saw me, with Marlon Brando.
You know, we' re good friends.
- I was his driver.
- No shit?
- Brando, huh?
Cartagena.
- Gillo Pontecorvo.
He was the director. ltalian guy.
- Tell me about him.
I also worked -- I also know Paul Newman.
- I worked with him in Tucson.
Hey, do you know Benny Álvarez?
They are in Tucson.
- Subtotal.
- No?
He' s a nice guy. $283, 107. 65.
You want a company check here?
I got 284. 6.
That' s just not possible.
The machine don' t make mistakes.
- Let' s count it again.
- No, no.
Business is business.
Come on.
Okay, you keep the change.
Okay.
- Well, I' il count it again for you.
- No, no, come on.

- Me and Benny Álvarez have lunch together.
He probably knows me.
You ask him.
We' re up to what?
Seven checks.
1, 325, 623.
- Two hundred thousand more, and we ought to take a leak.
Get 'em up!
Get your hands against the wall and turn around.
- You' re not kidding.
- You' re under arrest for violation of the Rico Statute.
You have the right to remain silent.
- Anything you say can and will be taken against you.
- Fuck you!
- How do I know you guys are cops?
Oh, that pretty good, man.
Where' d you get that?
You call yourself a Cuban?
You make a real Cuban throw up!
Call your dog off me, Seidelbaum.
- I wanna call my lawyer.
- Lotta good he' s gonna do you.
You see that eye there in the clock?
Say, hi, honey.
Ah, that' s pretty cute.
He jerk off in front of us, Seidelbaum?
I was supposed to meet this chick at 3: 00.
You' re a fuckin 'pain in the ass.
All right, Danny, kill it.
You understand the rights I' ve given you?
I know all that bullshit, Seidelbaum!
Save your breath.
You got nothin 'on me.
You know it!
I' m changin 'dollar bills, that' s all.
You wanna waste my time?
Okay.
He' s the best lawyer in Miami.
He' s such a good lawyer, that by tomorrow morning, you gonna be working in Alaska.
[Sheffield]
Give me a check for a hundred grand, plus 300 in cash, and I guarantee you walk on the conspiracy charge.
But they' re gonna come back at us on a tax evasion, and they' il get it.
So... what am I lookin 'at here?
Five years.
You' il be out in three.
Maybe less, if I can make a deal.
Three fuckin 'years!
For what?
Washing money?
The fuckin 'country was built on washed money.
- It can' t be that bad.
It' s not like Cuba.
- What the fuck you talking?
- The jails are like hotels.
- You kidding me or what?
- You fuckin 'high or what?
- I' il delay the trial.
A year and a half, two years.
You won' t even start --
Hey, fuck you, man!
I' m not going back in any cage, okay?
I been there.
Okay, look.
I give you $400, 000 more.
Okay, now that' s $800, 000.
With that kind of money, you can buy the Supreme Court.
Tony, the law has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
I' m an expert at raisin 'that doubt.
But when you a got a million- three undeclared dollars... staring into a videotape camera, honey, baby, it' s hard to convince a jury you found it in a taxicab.
Tony, I' m so glad you could come on such short notice.
I really appreciate it.
- It' s okay.
- How' s Elvira?
- Ah, great.
- Three more months.
- Oh, yeah?
Congratulations.
- How 'bout you?
When you gonna have another Tony to take your place?
- I' m working on it.
- You have to work harder.
I want you to meet some of my friends.
This is Pedro Quinn, chairman of the Andes Sugar Corporation.
- Pleasure meeting you, Mr. Montana.
- Nice to meet you.
General Edward Strasser, commander of the First Army Corps.
- Pleasure.
This is Ariel Bleyer with the Ministry of the lnterior here.
And here is our friend, Charles Goodson from Washington.
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Mr. Montana?
Sit here, Tony.
Gentlemen.
I would like to discuss something that is of interest to all of us here.
You have a problem, Tony.
We... have a problem.
I think together we can solve all our problems.
We all know that you have tax troubles in your country... and that you may have to do a little time.
But we have some friends in Washington that assure us these troubles can be taken care of.
You may have to pay some back taxes, a big fine, but, uh, there will be no prison.
Okay.
So what' s your problem, Alex?
I' il show you my problem.
I' ve heard whispers about financial support your government receives... from the drug industry in Bolivia.
Well, the irony of this is that this money, which is in the billions, is coming from your country.
You are the major purchaser of our national product, which is cocaine.
On one hand you' re saying the United States government... is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets.
At the same time, we are doing business with the same government... that is flooding our streets with cocaine.
Let me show you a few of the other characters... that are involved in this tragicomedy.
My organization just recently traced a large purchase... by this man.
This charming face here belongs to General Cucombre.
He is the minister of the defense of Bolivia, my country.
And General Cucombre just a couple of months ago... bought a $12 million villa on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.
Now, if Cucombre is supposed to be the Bolivian defense minister, what is he doing living in Switzerland, guarding cash registers?
Alejandro Sosa, a very interesting character.
He' s a wealthy landowner, educated in England, very good family.
But this man is the business brain and drug overlord... of an empire that stretches across the Andes.
He' s not your ordinary drug dealer.
Well, discussing it openly -- [Tape Stops]
He is scheduled for 60 Minutes next.
Japanese television.
People everywhere are starting to listen to him.
It' s embarrassing, Tony.
- That is our problem.
You remember Alberto, don' t you?
How could I forget him?
Alberto is an expert in the disposal business.
He' s going to help us fix our problem.
But he doesn' t speak English.
He doesn' t know his way around the States too well.
He needs a little help.
ls that a problem, Tony?
No problem.
Good.
So what' s the big mystery with the Bolivian situation?
You gonna tell me what happened with Sosa or what?
- A lotta bullshit, that what happened.
Politics.
I want you to stay down here for a while.
Run things for me.
I gotta go to New York next week.
Fuck this, man.
I don' t like it, man.
I don' t like this at all.
You don' t like it?
You the one that got me into this mess in the first place, you know that?
- With that fuckin 'Seidelbaum, that right?
With Seidelbaum?
Man, what does Seidelbaum have to do with Sosa?
- [Sniffing]
- Why don' t you eat your food?
What' s wrong with it?
- I' m not hungry.
- You' re not hungry?
You even know about the trial?
- What did you order it for then?
- I lost my appetite.
- [Manny]
That' s what it' s all about, Manny?
Eating, drinking, fucking, sucking?
- Come on, man.
[Snickers]
- Snorting?
Tell me.
Then what?
You' re 50.
You got a bag for a belly.
You got tits; you need a bra.
They got hair on 'em.
You got a liver, and they got spots on it, and you' re eatin 'this fuckin' shit, and you' re lookin 'like these rich fuckin' mummies in here.
Come on.
It' s not so bad.
It could be worse.
- ls this what it' s all about?
This what I work for?
Tell me.
Look at that.
A junkie.
I got a fuckin 'junkie for a wife.
She don' t eat nothin '.
Sleeps all day... with them black shades on.
- Wakes up with a Quaalude, - Don' t pick on her, man. and who won' t fuck me 'cause she' s in a coma.
I can' t even have a kid with her, Manny.
I can' t even have a fuckin 'little baby with her!
- [Whispering]
- You fuck!
- You shouldn' t talk like that.
How dare you talk to me like that!
What makes you so much better than me?
- What do you do?
- Don' t worry.
You deal drugs and you kill people.
Oh, that' s wonderful, Tony.
Real contribution to human history.
Tell everybody.
- You want a kid?
- Tell the world.
- What kind of a father do you think you' d make!
- Gonna drive him to school in the mornings?
Are you even gonna be alive by the time the kid goes to school?
- You don' t even know how to be a husband!
- Sit down before l --
Do we ever go anywhere without having six thugs hanging around all the time?
- I have Nick the Pig as a friend.
- What kind of life is that?
We' re losers.
We' re not winners; we' re losers.
You' re stoned.
I' m not stoned; you' re stoned.
- Come on.
No.
I' m not going home with you.
[Sighs]
I' m going home alone.
I' m leaving you.
I don' t need this shit anymore.
Okay, but I' il walk you out.
I' il take her home in a cab.
Let her go, man.
Another Quaalude, she gonna love me again.
What you lookin 'at?
You all a bunch of fuckin 'assholes.
You don' t have the guts to be what you wanna be?
You need people like me.
You need people like me so you can point your fuckin 'fingers... and say, "That' s the bad guy."
So... what that make you?
Good?
You' re not good.
You just know how to hide -- how to lie.
Me, I don' t have that problem.
Me, I always tell the truth.
Even when I lie.
So say good night to the bad guy!
Come on.
The last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again, let me tell you.
Make way for the bad guy.
There' s a bad guy comin 'through!
Better get outta his way!
Yeah, yeah.
You tell Sheffield to keep his nose out of it.
There' s gonna be no trial.
I got it all under control now.
Just tell him to stay out of it!
Okay, what about Elvira?
Yeah, all right.
Tony, everything go okay?
Yeah, everything is roses.
Ernie, what time you got?
- Ten to.
- Where is this guy, man?
- I gotta call Manny again.
- Fuck you!
You don' t tell me what to do here!
- He' s coming out.
He' s coming.
- I don' t give a fuck.
- It' s him, man.
[Alberto Speaking Spanish]
I don' t care where you blow him up.
Tell me when, okay?
You just tell me when.
That' s all I care about.
You don' t have to keep telling me.
That' s all you gotta tell me.
[Snorting]
This fuckin 'guy, I' m tellin' you.
[Snorting]
Look.
Where' s he goin '?
What' s he doin 'that way?
What the fuck he doin '?
What the fuck is that?
Hey, come here.
- You told me she took the kids in the other car.
- She did, boss.
She did every fuckin 'day.
Hey, no fuckin 'way.
That' s it!
This fuckin 'guy.
Fuck you, you fuckin 'vulture.
Two little kids in the car.
This is so fuckin 'bad.
This is so fuckin 'bad.
I see 'em, all right?
I see 'em!
Shut the fuck up, okay?
You don' t have the guts to look 'em in the eye when you kill' em.
You gotta hide with that fuckin 'shit.
[Chi Chi]
Come on.
Make you feel good, huh?
Make you feel good to kill a mother and her kids.
Make you feel big.
Well, fuck you!
What do you think I am?
You think I kill two kids and a woman?
I don' t need that shit in my life!
- [Groans]
What you think I am?
What you think, I a fuckin 'worm, like you?
I told you, man!
I told you, don' t fuck with me!
I told you, no fuckin 'kids!
No, but you wouldn' t listen!
Well, you stupid fuck!
Look at you now.
[Tony]
On a delivery?
Where the hell is Manny?
Where is he?
Uh, I don' t -- I don' t know, Tony.
He' s been gone the last couple of days.
- He didn' t say nothin '.
- He gone?
What?
I left him in fuckin 'charge, man!
Where the fuck is he?
You can' t trust nobody anymore!
I don' t know, Tony.
He just took off.
- He didn' t say nothing.
- Are you all right?
- No, I' m not all right!
And when I get back there, I gonna kick some ass all over the fuckin 'place!
- When you comin 'back?
- I' m comin 'back tonight!
This fuckin 'cocksucker!
Tony... your mama called.
Gina' s gone.
- Gone?
Where?
- She got to see you right away.
Okay, just tell her -- tell her I call her tonight, okay?
Listen to me.
What about Elvie?
- No.
- No?
Okay, listen to me.
lf she call, just tell her I love her.
Okay?
Just tell her that.
- You hear from Manny?
- No.
Your mama called again.
And Sosa has been ringing every half hour.
He sounds pissed.
Get him on the phone.
Elvie call?
- You keep tryin 'Manny.
I want that cocksucker here.
- I want him here now!
Okay?
Go ahead.
Get him, get him!
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, they told me.
I' m coming over.
I' il be over to see you.
Put it on the speaker.
What happened, Tony?
- Alex, how you doing?
- What happened?
Oh, we had some problems, you know?
Tony, what happened?
- We had a little problem.
- How you hear that?
- Because our friend gave a speech today at the U. N.
He was not supposed to give that speech, Tony.
Well, your guy Alberto, he' s a piece of shit, ya know?
I told him to do something.
He didn' t listen, so I had to cancel his contract.
My partners and I are pissed off, Tony.
That' s okay.
No big deal.
There' s other Albertos, you know?
No, Tony, you can' t do that.
They found what was under the car, Tony.
Now our friend has got security up the ass, and the heat is gonna come down hard on my partners and me.
There' s not gonna be a next time, you fuckin ', dumb cocksucker!
- Take it easy when you talk to me.
I told you a long time ago, you fuckin 'little monkey, not to fuck me!
Hey, who the fuck you think you' re talking to?
Who the fuck you think I am, your fuckin 'bellboy?
You wanna go to war?
We take you to war, okay?
- Alex, you there?
He' s not there.
Cálmate, man.
She got a place of her own.
She don' t tell me where.
One night I follow her in a taxi, and she goes to this fancy house in Coconut Grove.
Where' d she get that kind of money?
You are giving her the money!
Don' t you see what you do to her?
- I don' t give her that kind of money.
- One time, a thousand dollars you gave her.
- Was a guy with her?
I don' t know.
There was this car in the driveway.
I know if I go in there, she' il kill me.
Where' s the place?
Four hundred something.
Cit -- Citrus Drive?
- Four hundred what?
- Four hundred nine, I think.
You gotta talk to her, Antonio.
She don' t listen to me.
- Come on.
- She says to me, mira, "Shut up.
Mind your own business. "
Exactly like you do to me.
Ever since you came back, she' s been getting this way.
- I gotta go.
- Why do you have to hurt everything you touch? - ¡Coño!
- Why do you have to destroy... everything that comes your way?
- 409 Citrus Drive.
- Tony, I can' t find Manny anywhere.
- Fuck!
I' il try again.
You stay here.
Keep trying Manny, okay?
We got married just yesterday.
We were gonna surprise you.
Jesus, Tony.
Tony, we gotta get outta here, man.
We gotta get outta here.
Go get Gina.

Come on, Gina.

We gotta get out of here.
Come on, Gina.

No!
This is Tony' s place!
Let me go!
We put some pills into her.
She' s gonna be all right, Tony.
She' s cooling down.

Just fine.
What are we gonna do now?

We' re gonna war.
That what we' re gonna do.
We' re gonna eat that Sosa for breakfast!
Close that fucker down!
Take it easy.
All right, Ernie.
Let' s go.
We' il take care of the house.
This cocksucker' s gonna run all over you.
I bury these cocksuckers.
We gotta get organized here.
Fuck!
Oh, fuck, Manny.
How the fuck I do that?
How the fuck I do that, Manny?
ls this what you want, Tony?
You can' t stand for another man to be touching me.
So you want me, Tony, huh?

[Chuckles]

I take your fuckin 'bullet! - ¡Parada! ¡Parada!
I take your fuckin 'bullet!
You think you kill me with bullets?
Go ahead!
[Screams]
Thanks.
Is it okay if I smoke?
Sure.
My matches are all wet.
- You got a lighter?
- Yeah, it' s here somewhere.
It' s my wife' s car.
There we are.
I remember once...... going on a school trip to the top of the Empire State Building.
When I looked down at the people on the street...... they looked like ants.
I pulled out a penny and some of us talked about what would happen...... if I dropped it from up there and it landed on somebody' s head.
Of course, I never crossed that line and actually dropped the penny.
I don' t think Early Grayce even knew there was a line to cross.
It' s about the mind of a serial killer and culpability.
Whoever can' t distinguish right from wrong is like a child.
By law, he should be treated like a child.
Not imprisoned or executed.
There you go again.
Next you' il lay it all at the altar of misfiring synapses...... amok biochemicals and horrendous childhoods.
It' s true.
Most of these poor people suffer from chemical brain imbalances.
- Is that enough tequila?
The answer is research and treatment under hospital conditions.
Not the electric chair.
Great, Brian.
Unless it' s your mother they find in the refrigerator.
But executing the killer wouldn' t bring my mother back.
- Thank God.
- Oh, everybody' s a joker.
It would sure make you feel better.
No, actually, it wouldn' t.
The bottom line is, these people are evil, plain and simple.
How about a bowl of chili?
A hot one.
Be right there!
"Antichrist will be a woman...... in a man' s body...... with seven heads and seven tails."
Make that to go.
"The Antichrist...... will be a woman...... in a man' s body.
Seven heads and seven tails. "
"Antichrist will be a woman...... in a man' s body.
Seven heads and seven tails. "
But there' s a difference between an article and a book.
I know.
Everything I wanted to know about serial killers fit on four pages.
Brian, what are we doing here?
Research.
Come on, look at this.
You' il get some great photos in here.
This is where her nightmares began.
Her father worked the night shift here.
Most nights he' d take her with him.
She was 1 1 years old.
Of course, the bastard knew...... nobody could hear her screams over the noise of the machines.
The article got me a book deal, a little cash up front.
But between the rent and the convertible, the advance was gone.
I owed a book, and I was stuck.
All I knew about serial killers I learned at a university library.
And the only thing I knew for certain...... was that people didn' t kill each other in libraries.
She murdered her first victim here.
They found him stuffed in the corner.
They found her second victim...... over there.
Can you imagine the rage and pain she felt returning here?
And becomes the criminal.
Where did everybody go?
I didn' t take that long.
Size seven.
That' s right, ain' t it?
Super size seven.
Oh, Early, you' re a specialist.
Oh, thank you, honey.
These are beautiful.
This reminds me of Cinderella when the prince gave her his glass slipper.
Except these ones are red and they ain' t see- through.
And there' s two of them.
That my chili?
Oh, honey.
Happy birthday to me.
Thank you.
Tonight turned out to be interesting.
Oh, those fascinating friends of yours and their stimulating conversation.
No, the warehouse.
I' m not that stoned.
Oh, the warehouse.
Actually, yeah, it was interesting.
It was definitely the highlight of the evening.
Just being there where it all happened...... I could almost...
Take your shirt off.
Yes, ma' am.
Come here.
Early!
What?
I' il be waiting for you when you get back.
Put your titty back up.
Wait, I forgot!
Mr. Diebold stopped by yesterday.
If we don' t give him his money by the end of the month...... he' il kick us the F- U- C- K out of here.
He cussed at you?
- You gonna talk to him?
- Well...
Shut up!
He comes back here, don' t you open that door.
Well, suppose he hears me inside?
I picked up some Chinese.
Did you hear from the gallery?
You got your slides back?
What did they say?
You know, same story, different day.
They' re idiots.
"Too graphic."
"Too overt."
"Not suitable for mass consumption."
You don' t want to be suitable for mass consumption.
I know.
It' s just...
Who cares anyway, right?
Not me.
Christ, I' m dying here.
Why can' t we just get the hell out of here?
Why can' t we just go to California?
Just like that?
Yeah, just like that.
What the hell did I know about California?
For some people, it was still a place of hopes and dreams.
A chance to start over.
The idea was if you could just get there, everything would be okay.
And if it wasn' t okay there...... then it probably wasn' t gonna be okay anywhere.
Adele, whose car is that out front?
She' s not here.
Shit.
Well, look who stopped by.
I ain' t supposed to be at the parole office till tomorrow, 2: 00.
You' re supposed to notify me when you lose your job.
Yeah.
I stopped by the mirror factory today.
You left quite a mess behind.
Well, that wasn' t my fault.
It' s a dangerous area and they treat me like shit.
Nobody ever has treated you right, have they?
Your daddy was picking on you when he threw you out of the house...... for stealing the tires off his truck.
Way out of line...... when they kept you from beating that bartender half to death.
You know...... I bet the Lord will be picking on you come Judgment Day.
Now hold on there!
I ain' t got nothing against God, see?
Get out of there!
What are you looking for?
That girlfriend of yours...... not much for housekeeping, is she?
Well, I was thinking about moving anyhows.
Maybe down to Texas.
- Get a job on one of them rigs.
- What are you talking about?
Well...
You know you can' t leave the state.
Just a thought.
What you can do is get a job.
You be at this address...... 3: 00 sharp.
What is it?
Janitor' s job.
Well, don' t want to be no janitor.
I don' t give two shits what you want and what you don' t want.
I' m telling you to be there.
Or you' il be having dinner with the sheriff.
You understand me, boy?
You ought to try putting a bag over your head for that cough.
Works every time.
You peg- armed piece of shit.
She came back to the warehouse that her father molested her in.
Why?
Because this place is the catalyst.
She needed to relive her nightmares before she could kill those men.
Oh, hey, sleeping beauty.
- I didn' t have the heart to wake you.
Oh, my head.
What are you doing?
I sat down with your photos... which are wonderful.
Thank you.... and my tapes and I started writing.
How' s it going?
It' s the best stuff I' ve ever done.
And I think I know why.
Why?
Because for the first time I understood her as a human being.
I was walking where she walked, where she killed.
Looking through her eyes.
I think we got a book here.
With your pictures and my writing, it' s a book.
On the warehouse murders?
No, on the most infamous murders in American history.
We' il go where they lived and where they killed.
You take the pictures, I' il write the text.
- What are you talking about?
- About this!
We can go through Tennessee.
We can drop through Arkansas...... wherever the hell Arkansas is.
Then we can drop down into Texas...... and from there, it' s a straight shot into...
- California.
And we don' t stop till we hit the fucking ocean.
Thank you.
We' il figure it out.
Hold it a minute, boy!
Shit!
You' il settle that rent here and now!
I' m tired of your bullshit!
I want my money!
Dipshit.
Son of a bitch!
Come back!
You tell him I want you both out of here by Sunday...... or I' il call the police.
Elvis, get the fuck off of him!
The rideshare was my idea.
I thought if a student wanted to go to California...... they' d help pay for the gas.
Carrie wasn' t crazy about the idea...... but the Lincoln only got eight miles a gallon.
- They say the whole thing...
- Will slide into the ocean.
"Looking for somebody to take turns driving and share expenses...... on a week- long, cross- country tour of historic murder sites"?
You' ve got to be kidding.
Brian, who in their right mind would want to do that?
- I would.
- Like I said...
Hey, good luck on that thesis.
Don' t know where the personal office is at, do you?
The personnel office is first door on the left.
What, down there?
Stinking bitch.
Shit.
Early?
How you doing, mama?
Fine.
Boy, I' m tired.
- Dinner ready yet?
- Almost.
Well, let me know.
Early?
Yeah?
Will you tell me more about California?
Yeah, I guess so.
Let' s see.
For one thing...... people think faster out there on account of all that warm weather.
That' s a fact.
I guess that explains why there are so many stupid people around here.
- You know what else?
It' s on the trees everywhere you turn.
And they ain' t got speed limits.
I hear your first month' s rent is free.
I' m thinking till we get settled, we' il move from month to month.
How would that be with you, mama?
What will we do out there?
By God, the first thing we' il do is get a six- pack of Lucky Lager...... and we' il climb up to that famous Hollywood sign...... and we' il howl at the moon.
Just like that.
I heard there ain' t nothing on that moon...... except some little golf balls that the astronauts left behind.
No, that ain' t right.
That' s bullshit.
The government' s sending people there.
Just don' t want us to know.
Now, get!
Well, let me know when you' re finished.
Shit.
- What was he like over the phone?
- He was real polite.
He kept calling me "sir."
- I like that.
- I bet you do.
You should try it once in a while.
I don' t know.
This is really weird.
We should have met them first.
Beggars can' t be choosers.
They were the only ones to answer the note.
Oh, God.
Please don' t let them be as boring as Brian' s friends.
Anything but that.
Early, we shouldn' t be doing this.
Now, you know you ain' t even allowed to be leaving the state.
And these people are strangers...... and what kind of people stop at places...... where other people got murdered?
What if these people are dangerous?
Honey.
Early Grayce.
- You settle things with Mr. Diebold?
- Yeah, I did.
Left him with the car.
We' re all straight now.
- What is that?
- That' s Lucy.
What kind of cuckoo brain carries a cactus in her purse?
I don' t know.
Straighten up.
You' ve got to be kidding.
They look like Okies.
Jesus, they look kind of weird.
They don' t have five bucks.
You let me do the talking.
- Let' s keep going.
- Lighten up.
- How many times you gonna say that?
- As many as it takes.
Lighten up.
- Early?
- Mr. Kessler?
Hi, I' m Brian Kessler.
Nice to meet you.
You must be Adele.
Uh- huh, that' s Adele.
- Hi.
- Can I help you with your luggage?
- Oh, yeah.
I' il get these.
Hi, I' m Adele.
Hi, I' m Carrie.
I like your hair.
Oh, thanks.
Because it' s short.
Oh, yeah.
Well...... thanks.
Carrie was right.
If you looked up "poor white trash" in the dictionary...... a picture of Early and Adele would be there.
But if I was gonna be a good writer, I' d have to ignore the clichés...... and look at life through my own eyes.
So, Early.
What do you do?
Well, I do some work at the...
Well, I did some work at the mirror factory.
Know what, Brian?
One night when we was staying up late...... we was talking about how much bad luck he must have...... from all those mirrors he broke.
And I swear we came to 449 years...... that it would take for him to work it all off.
And he' d have to, after he died...... he' il have to keep coming back to Earth...... over and over and over again.
- Yeah, karma.
- What?
- Karma.
You know...... when you do something bad to someone and fate pays you back by...... something bad happening to you.
Is that French?
We can stop if you and Adele haven' t had breakfast.
I don' t eat breakfast.
It' s because of what he read in this book once.
And it was put out by the cereal people.
Jesus Christ!
- Who are you?
- I' m his parole officer.
Right.
Talked to you on the phone.
What the hell happened?
They say it' s a torch job.
- That sound like your boy?
- Could be.
- Where do I find him?
- I don' t know.
Crazy son of a bitch was talking about moving to Texas.
Without his car?
What about the owner of the house...... Mr. John Diebold?
Know where he is?
I don' t know.
I tell you, he won' t be happy when he sees this.
Jesus Christ!
Early seemed harmless.
Primitive but harmless.
Of course, the fact was...... he' d killed his landlord less than an hour before we met him.
He was even wearing the guy' s ring.
Who knows what he did with the finger.
Here you go, mama.
Oh, thank you, honey.
Look what I got.
I got a camera.
Who gets...... the water?
- Thanks.
I got bags of chips and some jerky if you want.
Just in case.
From the moment I began working on the book...... I found myself asking one question over and over.:
What' s the difference between a killer and one of us?
What is it they had or didn' t have that separated them from us?
The Novaks are long gone...... but the fence they hired Michael Zeruba to put up...... is still here.
- The Novaks...
- Hey, you two.
Come on, show your love.
The Novaks embraced the young drifter as one of their own.
The neighbors said...... he was a quiet young man, often seen pushing the children on the swing set.
Everything was fine until the Novaks ran out of work for Michael to do...... and had to ask him to leave.
How does a man get to the point...... where he can kill another human being in cold blood?
Early, could you move out of the way, please?
The first to die...... was the 9- year- old daughter.
Hi, I' m Brian Kessler.
What' s your name?
Pa?
Pa, where are you?
Pa, there' s somebody at the door who wants to see you.
- What?
Who is it?
- I don' t know.
Good afternoon, sir.
I' m sorry to wake you.
My name is Brian Kessler.
I' m a writer.
I' m working on a book on the most famous murders in American history.
I' m sure you' re aware that this is the Novak farm.
I was wondering if my girlfriend, Carrie...... could come in and take a few pictures...... and I' il just tape some notes...... and we' il be out in five minutes.
I could walk around, get a feel for it.
Goddamn ghouls.
We drove all day to get here.
I' d be out in five minutes.
Five minutes!
Brian, come on.
Just forget about it.
At the time I was angry Mr. Baxter slammed the door in my face.
But it was just his way of forgetting...... of pretending that nothing terrible had ever happened there.
I guess it' s only natural to try and forget the bad things that happen.
You never really do, though.
Well, we' ve come 480 miles so far.
Not bad for a day' s haul, huh?
Pretty good, bud.
You got any family or friends in California, Early?
No.
- No, I don' t.
Do you have any friends or family in California, Carrie?
What?
No.
Well, that' s okay.
At least we all got each other, right?
I mean...... that' s something.
Because when you' re alone, it' s hard to develop your personality.
And with more people around you, it helps...... because friends are really important and...
Thank you.
- That' s...
We' il get the next one.
We gotta hit the sack.
Let' s go, mama.
- Have sweet dreams.
- Good night, Adele.
Good night, Early.
That' s funny.
I didn' t know you were so prejudiced.
Because I object to having somebody take off their shoe...... and scratch their foot while I' m eating...... l' m prejudiced?
- He can' t help the way he was raised.
I feel sorry for him.
You feel sorry for him.
That' s so sweet.
Obviously, you didn' t get a whiff of that sock.
Bitch, bitch, bitch.
Thirty bucks for a motel.
For what?
Lumpy mattress, crummy TV and a crapper?
Don' t think so!
- Honey, sing me a song.
I' m busy, mama.
- Just stay put.
- Please.
If you don' t sing it, I' m gonna sing it myself.
When we get to California, will you take me to that Chinese restaurant...... where all them footprints are out in front?
Only if they let me put mine down too.
Pretty smooth, how they stiffed us on dinner.
He didn' t stiff us.
He paid for the gas.
They' re almost broke and we are gonna end up paying for the two of them.
And don' t change the subject.
It' s my favorite subject, though.
Good morning.
Morning, Early.
Breakfast?
- No, I don' t eat breakfast.
Never do.
We don' t have a liquor license, so I' m afraid you' il have to...
That' s okay.
I got plenty more where this one come from.
- Morning.
- Morning, Adele.
You cut your hair.
Early cut it.
He said it makes me look more pretty.
And I think he' s right because...... he' s right.
Nice job, Early.
You like to order some breakfast?
No, I won' t be having breakfast this morning, thank you.
Want some of this?
- Finish.
- Thanks.
What you reading?
Sex Art in the American Culture.
No, I never read that one.
I can' t wait to get on the road.
I love that convertible.
Yeah, it' s great.
Because...... I like wind, Brian.
So do I.
You want me to get your stuff?
No, thanks, Early.
I meant to say luggage, ma' am.
I got them.
Hi, honey.
Mama.
When you dream...... there are no rules.
People can fly.
Anything can happen.
Sometimes, there' s a moment as you' re waking...... when you become aware of the real world around you...... but you' re still dreaming.
You may think you can fly, but you better not try it.
Somewhere between dreams and reality.
Guess it' s your turn to pay, Early.
Hey, move it!
Stupid son of a bitch.
You know, I used to smoke before I met Early.
But he broke me of that.
Broke you?
Yeah, because Early, he don' t think...... that women should smoke or drink or cuss.
So you know what I do?
I spell all my cuss words.
"S." Ouch.
"S- H." Ouch!
S- H- l- T!
But you don' t do any of those other things.
No.
I mean, I better not.
He whips you?
No!
Only when I deserve it.
You were in there a long time.
I took a dump.
You don' t want to go in.
It' s wall- to- wall stink.
Just gonna go wash my hands.
Ain' t got no sink.
- Nope.
Damnedest thing I ever seen.
Let' s go.
How about I drive, bud?
No, mama, get in the back. $28. 35, sir.
- How much? - $28. 35.
Hope I got that.
Make it an even 30.
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.
When you first meet people, all you see are the differences between you.
But as time passes, you start noticing the similarities.
I guess that' s how all friendships begin.
Okay, so you first.
You put down a card, and then I put down a card.
And then when they match up...... and it' s the same card...... then you go "snap" and I take it.
Like that.
Snap.
I thought you said you never played this before.
I haven' t.
I' m a fast learner, I guess.
I was reading in your deal how they never caught that Black Doler killer.
- Yeah.
They didn' t.
Well, I was wondering how come.
See what I' m getting at?
It' s like...
Well, some people think he just stopped killing...... disappeared back into society.
That' s dandy, but I want to know what a smart fellow like yourself thinks.
I always thought it was a serial killer.
Anybody who took that much time and care bisecting a human being...
- Bisecting?
- You know, he cut them in two.
- He hacked them up?
- Two pieces, yeah.
In half.
Anybody who did that must' ve enjoyed it...... and he would' ve done it again until somebody stopped him.
That' s good.
That' s a good theory, Bri.
You want to hear mine?
Okay.
Ain' t you gonna record it?
Early Grayce' s Black Dahlia theory.
June 23rd.
Okay.
Now, I' m betting he' s still alive.
Real old, living in a trailer park or something somewhere.
But he' s alive, see?
Going over it, over and over it, in his head every night...... figuring he' s smart for getting away with it.
- That' s possible.
- Hey, you shoot pool?
Come on, bud.
Designated driver.
Minnesota Fats.
Don' t forget your key.
Why did I open my big mouth?
Please come home soon.
Let' s go!
Jesus, bud, you damn near swallowed her!
Why didn' t you go with them, Adele?
Because...... you know how Early feels about women drinking.
So how did you and Early meet, anyways?
I was hitchhiking this one day...... and Early stopped.
And I walked up to look in the window...... and I looked in.
And Early' s face, he was down like that...... because he was serious.
And then he...
"You getting in?" And...
And that' s when I saw his eyes.
And, I swear, Carrie, he has the eyes of an angel.
I ended up moving in his trailer with him...... because I thought it' d be kind of neat.
But...
You know what?
What if me, you, and Brian and Early...... all moved into a house together in California?
Wouldn' t that be fun?
Well, I mean...
Well, we' il see what happens.
You never know.
Okay.
Do you want me to fix your hair for you?
Yes.
Because...... I don' t really like it...... that much.
Come on, then.
- Okay.
- It doesn' t look that bad...... but I think we should fix it.
I' m betting we' re gonna find us some doors around here.
Yeah, the doors out front, on the street.
Not "doors."
- Doors, bud.
Openings to other dimensions.
You see, I read, bud.
And I' m telling you, if a man knows what he' s doing...... he can transport himself to anywhere in this goddamn universe.
- Didn' t know that, did you?
- No, I didn' t.
I should tell you I' m not much of a pool player.
Oh, it ain' t hard.
I can teach you.
- Yeah.
Spot you a few balls first game too.
- You' re not gonna hustle me, are you?
- How much money you got?
What' s that?
That' s a portfolio of my work.
That' s what that is.
Your pictures?
Can I look at them?
Go right ahead.
Oh, my Lord!
Did you take this one?
I took all of those.
Yeah, that one' s me.
No, it isn' t!
Hold still, you.
Oh, I' m sorry.
Oh, my God, Carrie.
If Early ever saw me in a picture like that...... l' d be black- and- blue for a week.
You shouldn' t let him do that to you.
You think Early' s mean to me?
Well, he' s not.
He may punch me once in a while...... but he' s not mean.
When I was 1 3...
... there were these three boys.
And they raped me...... in the back of this truck and...
And...... they hurt me so bad...... that I was in the hospital for, like, four months.
And I feel safe with Early because...... most of the time, he treats me really nice.
And...... I know that he' d never...
He would never let anything like that ever happen to me again.
I like my hair.
You did a really good job, Carrie.
It' s really professional.
Hey, Marlene!
Come here, baby.
Why don' t you and me get together tonight and sweat it up some?
Fuck off, T. J.
There you go.
That' il be five bucks.
Wait a minute.
These aren' t Lucky Lager.
- We ordered Lucky Lager.
- Take a look around you.
If you see something lucky around here, you let me know.
Why don' t you tell me what you think is so funny?
- What?
- You think I' m funny?
No.
What would a jizz- gargling cum- drunk fairy like you do...... with a pretty girl like that?
What are you talking about, man?
Just relax.
Because it' s coming.
What' s that?
This your boyfriend?
No, he' s not my boyfriend.
Why don' t you cool it, man?
- Hey, asshole!
- This ain' t Lucky Lager.
Break it up!
Wasn' t that guy' s fault.
T. J. Started it.
Dipshit!
Rack 'em up!
Because your pink replaces your red
My ma was a beautician.
- Really?
- Yeah, she likes pink a lot.
You should' ve seen her face.
She was mad when she first found out I was with Early...... on account of him just getting out of jail and all.
She hasn' t talked to me in over a year now.
I wish she' d call me, Carrie.
Early' s been in jail?
What for?
For carrying a gun.
And resisting arrest.
It' s a really interesting story, actually.
He put up a fight with the policeman...... and they struggled...... because he didn' t want to be arrested.
I' d have done the same thing.
Why aren' t you laughing now?
I don' t know.
I just don' t think...... that carrying guns and resisting arrest is very funny.
Well...... l' m gonna go back to my hotel room now, Carrie.
I had a really great time with you.
I just think I had too many beers.
And I wasn' t even supposed to be drinking in the first place.
I didn' t mean...
Great.
Look at this dipshit.
- Fuck you!
Get him, Bri.
Tear him up!
Oh, I gotta see a man about a mule.
What?
Take a piss.
Hey, see if there' s any "reebs" in the back seat.
- What?
- "Reebs." Beers.
That' s what we used to call them when we were kids.
That' s "beer" spelled backwards.
Shit.
- Think I chipped the concrete, Bri.
- The last one.
I want you to have it for saving my ass back there.
It ain' t nothing.
I picked out that big Yankee mother a year ago.
By God, I' m uglier than you are.
Come on!
Thank you.
How long you had your woman, bud?
Oh, three years.
She' s a good one.
She' s a breeder, you dog.
I' il tell her you said that she' s a breeder.
I' il tell her.
Can I get a hork off that, bud?
Do you remember them doors?
Them doors I was talking about, Bri?
I got me a couple of them, found me a couple of them in Kentucky.
Hell, I wasn' t even looking for the first one.
I was on the side of the road, swinging my sickle.
I turned around, and there' s this door...... this big old door.
And light' s coming out, blinding me, real gold.
And I' m thinking, "This can' t be."
So I close my eyes...... and I count one, I count two...... I count three, I count four, five...... and I open my eyes...
It wasn' t there.
Come on.
Am I late?
I' m sorry.
Early and me, we got into a fight in this bar.
I was just...
It was me and him against, like, 30 guys.
You know, we gotta talk about your good buddy Early.
Who said he' s my good buddy?
You sure been acting like you were.
Out whooping it up and drinking and everything.
- You' ve been drinking too.
- Oh, yeah, right.
You should' ve seen how scared she was that he was gonna find out.
He beats her, you know.
How do you know that?
Because she told me, that' s how I know that.
I gotta see a man about a mule.
But only when she "deserves" it.
Did you happen to know that he was in jail?
Yeah.
For stealing a car.
Really?
Is that what he told you?
He told her it was for carrying a gun.
Brian, it could be for murder for all we know.
Will you stop being so fucking melodramatic?
Melodramatic!
If it was murder...... he' d still be in jail...... or he' d be on parole...... in which case, he wouldn' t be allowed to leave the state.
Maybe he wasn' t allowed to leave the state.
You ever think about that?
Is that what you want?
What' s wrong with you?
Can we talk about this in the morning when the room isn' t spinning?
So how are you feeling now, Brian?
Does your stomach feel kind of like it' s...... in these knots and it' s twisty...... and you could just explode at any given moment?
Well, my daddy, he used to make this great drink for hangovers.
And he' d make a blend of sauerkraut juice and Tabasco sauce...
Goddamn!
You see that woman?
She' s butt- ugly.
- He put in a little bit of lemon...
- Hairy too.... for the tartness.
And then the last ingredient, Brian...... this is the best one, was an egg so that he could have breakfast...... and get rid of his hangover all in the same time.
Shave that dog and teach it to hunt!
Early lived in the moment.
He did whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted.
It was that simple.
I don' t know if I was fascinated or frightened by him.
Probably both.
Okay, what should I call you?
I can' t call you Lucy.
Lucy' s gone.
I' il call you Shelly.
Hi, Shelly.
I know you' re thirsty.
What?
What' s going on?
- Look.
- What?
Look!
The only thing my old man ever give me was this goddamn. 45.
Japanese, but it' s pretty good.
Go on, shoot it.
Shoot it.
- I don' t know how to do it.
- You can do it.
- I haven' t...
- Point it and shoot the damn thing.
You' re all like this!
Okay?
Boys will be boys.
No.
Now, hold on.
Hold on.
Aim.
Okay, loosen up.
Loosen your elbow.
You gotta breathe, bud.
Hold it.
Shoot.
- Hey, Carrie!
- Good one.
That' s a good one, bud.
Good one.
Like that gun?
I' il give it to you.
I want you to have it.
- I don' t need a gun.
- Go on, take it.
I' il get me another one.
You never know out in California with all them cuckoos.
Best hold on to it.
Now give it another shot, you mean boy.
Go on.
Shoot that damn thing.
That' s super.
Look at that.
We' re gonna sit this one out, bud, if that' s to your "satisfication."
Fine.
If you need some help, bud, you just holler.
I' il be there.
Shit.
What is that?
A copy of the tape they found.
Where am I?
Mister, can you help me?
Speldor had him working in here...... before he was 8 years old...
- Who are you?... killing animals with a sledgehammer that was bigger than he was.
Can you get me out of here, please?
Look, I don' t know who you are.
I don' t know what you want me to be...... but, please, just let me go, okay?
When she was pissed at him...
What are you doing?... she' d beat the shit out of him...... then lock him in here overnight.
My parents, they have money.
I' il give you money...... if that' s what you want.
One morning...
... the little boy wakes up...... picks up the sledgehammer...
What are you gonna do with those things?... starts hurting back.
How does he get from...
What are you doing?
I' m finished.
I know you' re upset about the gun.
I' m not upset about the gun!
I' m upset about the gun, but that is not it.
God, can we please turn this off?
Goddamn it, what is going on here?
Never!
Then this afternoon, you' re out there wielding a gun...... like you' re Clyde- fucking- Barrow!
What' s going on with you?
Please talk to me!
It was stupid.
It was a cheap thrill, I admit it.
It was stupid.
It was just bang- bang, like kids.
Okay?
We need them.
I don' t want to blow it.
- Oh, the pictures.
God, that really is all that matters to you, isn' t it?
That really is all you care about, isn' t it?
God, I cannot believe I agreed to do this!
That is such crap!
You wanted to come take these photos every bit as much as I wanted you to.
Wrong.
Wrong!
And there' s a big difference.
- What?
- I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
I want him out of our car.
What happened?
- I want him out of our car.
- What happened?
It' s up to you.
... hundreds of acres and forced 7 0 people to evacuate...... was originally thought to have been arson.
Yeah, can I get a carton of Victory Kings...... and $20 worth of gas in the car?
Thanks.
Here' s your change.
Looks like a bad one coming in.
Y' all better be careful.
Where you headed?
California.
California.
I hear it never rains out there, huh?
It must be nice.
Hi, Carrie.
I have to go to the bathroom.
... fatal stabbing and robbery of Joseph Davies Robbins...... at this East Texas gas station.
He is armed and dangerous.
If you see this man, please notif...
... with a history of arrests is still at large.
Grayce is 25 years old, 5 '1 1, "with long brown hair.
He was last seen in East Texas at a gas station...
I ain' t riding no bus, bitch.... to be responsible for the murder of his landlord...... John Diebold of Nassau County.
The murder occurred last Tuesday.
We would like to repeat.:
There is a nationwide hunt for Early Grayce.
Knew that boy' d have a hogleg here somewhere.
Not a word.
Hello!
Get over here, skinny.
Sit your ass in that corner.
Come on.
- Honey, what are you doing?
- They gave us the boot, mama.
I don' t want him coming in.
- Honey, you' re scaring...
- Right now, missy.
Get!
- Hi.
I' m just getting my things, and then I' m gonna leave, Brian.
What' s your name, boy?
Walter Livesy.
I think I gotta kill you, Walter.
How do you feel about that?
Not so good.
- You sure you have to?
- I don' t know.
- Early, please...
- Shut up!
Goddamn it!
I' m trying to have a conversation with Walter.
I' m sorry about that, Walter.
Hey, don' t forget your yo- yo.
Listen, Adele...... you not coming with us has nothing to do with you guys.
It' s between Carrie and me.
Where you from?
Vernon, Florida.
Don' t know it.
Any hunting?
Turkeys, sometimes.
Yeah, turkeys are real smart.
Smarter than most people think.
Tell you what, Walter.
I want you down on your belly.
Get on your belly.
Stay there for a long time after we leave.
We got a deal, son?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.
You mind if I hold on to that Bible?
What do you want with your Bible, Walter?
He thinks I' m gonna kill him.
- That' d make me a liar, wouldn' t it?
- No, sir.
No?
Here you go, Walter.
I wonder if Adele would like one...
- What was that?
- Oh, my God.
Nothing, Brian.
It was just the thunder.
Hey, Early, what the fuck are you doing?
You' il like this one.
Get in.
Big fella, you' re riding shotgun.
Adele, you drive.
- What are you doing?
- Come on, bud.
Come on, let' s go.
What happened?
- Get us out of here, mama.
Oh, she gonna lie.
- What happened?
- He shot him in the head.
- Who shot who in the head?
- No, he didn' t, Carrie!
Everybody just shut up!
Goddamn, bitch, quit squawking!
Nothing' s changed.
If Adele don' t kill us with her driving first.
What' d you get us?
I got Chinese food.
What is it?
The guy, he didn' t speak too good of English...... so I just got what they had.
Smells like butt.
You get the beer?
What is this, Chink beer?
Goddamn it, Adele.
Well...... give this one to what' s- her- name.
Come over here, bud.
Get you some grub.
What the hell' s a Chinaman doing in the middle of an American desert?
Adele, where are the forks and spoons?
Is it me, or has this trip gone downhill since we ran out of Lucky Lager?
Wish I had me some chili beans.
How many people have you killed, Early?
Well, now, how many people you seen me kill?
None.
That' s how many I killed.
If you say so.
Damn right I do!
Just shut up!
Eat your food.
You ain' t never killed no one, have you, Bri?
- No.
- No?
Ain' t seen nobody killed either, have you?
- No.
Tell me something, big time:
How the hell you gonna write a book about something you know nothing about?
Mama, sing us a song or something.
I...... wish...... Carrie was happy
I...... wish...... she would smile
You guys want your picture taken?
Come on, Carrie, smile.
He was breathing when I walked out of there.
See, Carrie, it' s okay.
He was breathing.
Ain' t we getting near the next murder site?
It doesn' t matter anymore.
The hell if it don' t.
Give me that map.
Someday me and Adele, we' il be walking along...... we' il see your book in some store window.
We' il buy it and put it on our coffee table, right, mama?
Let' s go have us a look, people.
- Early, I' m gonna stay here.
- You don' t want to go, mama?
I' il take the pictures, Bri.
You run, Bri gets it.
Lead the way, bud.
So, uh, what happened here?
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here in the '70s.
Yeah, so?
They picked up hitchhikers, young men, and brought them here.
Hey, Bri.
It won' t give me nightmares, will it?
Get out of the way.
This one' s called "Walk the Dog."
My favorite one is "Rock the Cradle."
They were asked just before they were executed why they did it.
And they said, "To be famous."
Why did you do it, Early?
Do what, Bri?
You didn' t have to kill the guy.
Move a little to the left.
You wanted to.
Why?
Help me out, Early, I don' t know shit about killing.
You gotta tell me.
- Does it make you feel good?
- Huh?
- Huh?
What?
Who are you angry with?
Your mother?
Your father?
You want to know about my daddy, do you?
Yeah.
I' il tell you about my daddy.
Adele, you gotta help us out here and talk to Early.
He' s sick...... and he needs some help.
- You' re messing up my trick.
Adele, listen to me, please.
The police are after him.
He killed a man back there.
No, that ain' t true.
I saw him kill a man!
It ain' t true.
I' m your friend, why would I lie?
He said he didn' t.
Why would I lie about this?
I know you know.
- I don' t know why you' re saying this.
- Why would I lie?
He said he didn' t do it, and you ain' t my friend.
You' re on private property.
I need some kind of identification.
Please don' t say anything.
We got a match.
I' il call for backup.
Please, don' t say anything.
All right, ladies.
I' d like both of you to step slowly away from the car...
No, Early!
Got them both on a dead run.
Come on, mama.
Tell me that don' t hurt.
- Shoot him.
- What?
Put that crippled dog out of his misery.
You want to know about it, you gotta do it, son.
Shoot him!
Lay it on in there.
Come on, mean boy.
Come on, mean boy, do it!
Shoot him!
Shoot the dog, shoot the dog!
It' s him or you, boy!
Shoot him!
Go!
Go, mean boy!
Pussy faggot!
Look at his face!
Look at him!
I know that, you idiot!
That police is in a world of hurting, and this is a mercy kill.
Let' s hit the road.
Not even a simple "Thank you."
Thank you.
Thank you for what, Adele?
I don' t know, Early.
It was for saving your fucking life back there!
You were this close to spending the night in the county morgue!
- He wasn' t gonna shoot, you murderer!
- Stop it, Carrie.
- Are you fucking insane!?
- Shut up!
- He' s a murderer!
- Shut up, Carrie!
Goddamn bunch of loons!
Look, mama, there' s a pretty house.
Maybe they got some beer.
Look at all the cactuses.
They' re beautiful.
You know what makes cactuses so strong?
You can just forget about them forever and they' d still live.
They' d just keep growing...
We got to do something before Early kills somebody else.
- And they breed.
- Adele, will you listen to me?
You can' t do nothing, Brian.
Just sit still.
You have beautiful cactuses, ma' am.
I just love them.
My mama had a garden...... and I had this baby cactus.
- And I was gonna plant it...
- You gotta talk to Adele.
She looks up to you.
She' il listen.
I tried talking to her at the mine.
It didn' t work.
Then try again.
Hey, Bri, you ever stop...... and think, if you switched two letters in your name...... you' d spell "brain"?
Boy, you got a problem.
What' s wrong with grandma?
Where' s your husband?
I' m a widow.
Yeah?
That you, Peaches?
Sweetheart, come on over here.
It' s so clear, you can' t believe it.
It' s just amazing.
Take a look, honey.
I want you to see this.
Guess what, Early?
Miss Musgrave has this guest house in the back...... and it' s real beautiful.
And it' s empty, hon.
- She said if me and you wanted to...
Hank!
Well, you' re a widow now, Peaches.
Boring.
Boring.
Dog shit.
That don' t leave much to the imagination, does it?
I know him.
That' s my daddy.
Fucker.
Boring.
You' re not gonna die.
That' s you, ain' t it?
Yeah, that' s me.
Do you like it?
What do you think?
Dog shit.
You can go now.
Call me.
You should control your woman, boy.
Stinky.
Lucky for you they take all kinds in California.
That' s where we' il be tomorrow.
California.
Stupid.
Goddamn it.
Peaches!
Stop it, Early!
Stop it!
What are you doing?
Get the piano up and try and slide your hands under.
Mama, what are you...
Why are you crying?
I' m the one that got hit.
I' m not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you.
- And why not?
- You' re mean, Early!
- No, I' m not.
- You hurt those people, Early.
I don' t want to do it with you.
I loved you, Early.
You just be quiet.
You are mean.
Go!
- No, I' m not leaving you here!
Go!
- Adele!
- Adele!
Looks like I need me a new woman.
No!
Shut up!
Oh, God, I' il do anything.
I' il go with you.
Please don' t kill him.
Oh, God, I' il do anything.
Please don' t kill him!
Oh, mama, we gotta find us a door.
Save us some time...
Goddamn, that' s a super dress.
Yeah, that' s just super.
Oh, I didn' t think he' d left anyone alive.
Where' s Carrie?
They took off down the road.
Watch your head.
Grab that chair.
I' m gonna lift the piano.
Slide it under.
He pulled out all the phone lines.
The nearest one is 21 miles away.
He took the fire road west.
Take your car and get to that phone.
Call the police.
Well, how you all doing?
I' m Early.
This is my woman, Carrie.
Sorry to inconvenience you all like this, but, well...... looks like we' il be staying the night.
Don' t you move...... you Pinocchio- looking knuckleheads.
No!
Door...... where you been?
Carrie!
Motherfucker!
Brian came back!
Hey, Bri, you want to ask me some questions?
Ask me some questions!
Come on!
Do I feel powerful?
No.
I feel good.
You' re bleeding.
You' re bleeding.
Skynyrd!
Lynyrd Skynyrd!
I like that one.
The keys.
They' re around his neck.
I' il never know why Early Grayce became a killer.
I don' t know why any of them do.
Nothing.
That day, I learned any one of us is capable of taking another human life.
But I also learned that there is a difference between us and them.
It' s in feeling remorse.
Dealing with guilt.
And confronting your conscience.
Early never did.
June 22nd, the Novak Farm.
Mr. Baxter slammed the door in my face today, calling me a damn ghoul.
I' m betting he' s still alive.
Real old, living in a trailer park or something somewhere.
But, he' s alive, see?
Going over it, over and over it, in his head every night...... figuring how smart he is for getting away with it.
Thank you.
Not bad.
How was your swim?
It' s freezing.
It' s November.
I know.
There' s this gallery in Venice...... and I showed them my work, the Icon series.
- I think they' re interested.
- That' s great.
Well, it' s not definite, but it' s encouraging.
Well, let' s celebrate.
I' il take you to lunch.
Okay.
So, what happens next?
I have a meeting at the gallery on Thursday...... and they want to see some more of my work, so...
I' m sure they' re gonna love it as much as I do.
Hi.
It' s me.
It' s Adele.
I know I' m probably not supposed to be talking...... on the tape recorder, but...
I just wanted to say thank you...... for taking me and Early with you on your trip...... because me and Early' s having a really good time.
And I just hope that when we get to California...... that you guys don' t forget all about us.
Because friends are important...... and, well, you' re the only friends we got.
Bye.
McCaleb.
Whatever happens, it' il be his face on the front page.
What do you have?
I' ve had hemorrhoids for a while.
Victims five and six.
Code Killer strikes again.
You' re not a vegetarian, right?
How do you like your steak?
Big, red, juicy?
Neighbor came over to complain about the noise.
He got run over at the door.
Neighbor said he saw this from the door.
Bachelor number one hasn' t been dating lately.
Apparently, he' s a bed wetter.
You' re sick, you know that, Arrango?
- Neighbor says he didn' t see a thing.
- This might be important too.
The maid quit about six years ago.
She didn' t like the neighborhood.
We' re calling him Chuck Taylor.
Oh, how' s that?
Look.
Converse.
High- tops.
Chuck Taylor.
You get it, right?
You don' t know who Chuck Taylor is?
Basketball coach.
Stanford Cardinals.
We got the remains of two or three people.
One of them could be a midget.
In any case, it' s a hell of a gangbang.
Once you joke about it, you shouldn' t be doing it.
Another love note.
Maybe the two of you ought to get a room someplace.
Was another message left for you?
Why is he singling you out?
I can' t comment.
Are there numbers this time?
He loves it.
What does the message say?
- Do we have numbers this time?
- Were there numbers?
- Why does he single you out?
- What does he want?
Chuck.
You got a motive?
Clear.
Almost there.
Coming out.
Good, Terry.
You did good.
Are you taking your pills?
Yeah, all 34 of them.
- No fever at all?
All clear of that.
- No diarrhea?
- No, nothing.
Good.
- Blood pressure and pulse?
- Right on target.
You' re not working too hard on the boat?
That' s all.
I' il be back in a bit.
I' il check this blood work and get the tissue to the lab.
Okay.
Don' t start running laps yet, but I' m very pleased.
No rejection.
All your blood levels are good.
- I might lower your prednisone next week.
- Thank God.
I' m tired of shaving three times a day.
Lean forward.
- May I ask you something?
- No, don' t talk.
Sit up.
Okay, come around.
All right.
What did you want to ask me?
The kid in 218...... what' s his blood type?
It' s different from yours, if that' s what you wanted to know.
- How long has he been waiting?
- About half as long as you did.
What are his chances?
Maybe 50- 50, maybe less.
What' s bothering you, Terry?
I don' t know.
When I was at the Bureau, we had to qualify once a year on the range.
You know, shoot at targets, stuff like that.
We had a thing where you shoot a circle around a heart.
It was called the "10 ring." That was the highest score.
Typical.
You wait for a heart for two years...... almost don' t make it, then wonder if we should' ve given you that heart.
Know what that is?
B. S.?
Exactly.
Go home and enjoy your boat.
See you next week.
How are you doing?
Morning, Terry.
Morning?
It' s 2 in the afternoon, Buddy.
As long as my dad sends those checks, it' s whatever time I say it is.
- Whatever.
- Heads up, by the way.
Somebody' s on your boat.
Been here 10 minutes.
Looked harmless.
I didn' t say anything.
Looks better than harmless!
May I help you, miss?
I' m looking for Terry McCaleb.
You' re looking at him.
Graciella Rivers.
I have read about you in the paper, in the "Where are they now?" column.
You know, in the Metro section.
You' re not the first person to try to find me.
I can recommend a good investigator who won' t rip you off.
The article said you' re the best and you hate when someone gets away.
If you read it, you know what happened and that I' m retired, Miss Rivers.
Graciella.
I think you could help me.
How' s that?
- Maybe even help yourself.
I' m not talking about money.
Sister?
- And her son.
- Which one?
- Excuse me?
- Which one' s dead?
My sister.
Gloria Torres.
Glory.
And her son' s name is Raymond.
- I don' t think I can help you.
- Just look at it again, please.
Just one more time, and I' il leave you alone.
Just tell me if you perceive or feel anything.
Miss Rivers, I' m a retired FBI man, not a psychic.
- Do you want this back or not?
- I have a double.
You know, two for the price of one.
- Why is that?
Your heart, Mr. McCaleb.
It was my sister' s.
- How do you know that?
- Newspaper.
You two have the same blood type, AB with CMV negative.
You were operated on the day she died.
My number' s on the back if you change your mind.
Miss Rivers, this is Terry McCaleb.
Yeah, I' m sorry about it being so late...... but I wanted to tell you I' m going to the police to see what' s going on.
Don' t thank me.
Don' t get your hopes up.
I' m just gonna have a look.
I owe your sister that much.
May I help you?
- Detective Arrango and Waller around?
- Your name?
I' m here about the Gloria Torres case.
It' s McCaleb.
Down the hall, up the stairs, first door on your right.
Thanks.
Well, Mr. McCaleb.
Detective Arrango.
I thought you were dead or retired.
I hear you want to talk about Gloria Torres.
Can we talk privately?
About what?
- I' m looking into her death.
- Here we go, same old shit.
I' il give you five minutes, that' s it, before I toss your ass right out.
- My partner will be here in a minute.
- Want a doughnut?
I want to know who you' re working for.
Her sister, right?
That' s right.
Son of a bitch.
Let me see your ticket.
I don' t have a license, if that' s what you mean.
Is it stuffy in here?
No.
Just get a little air.
Let me give us some air and make it more comfortable.
Okay, let me get this straight.
You' re conducting a homicide investigation...... into the Gloria Torres case?
That' s true.
You don' t have a license to practice as a private investigator in California?
That' s right.
Do you know it' s a crime to practice as an investigator without a license?
Will you knock off the crap?
I just wanted to have a talk.
Knock off the tape too.
- He' s blocking the microphone anyway.
- Why didn' t you say?
In the three years we' ve interrogated here, maybe I forgot.
I' m just here to help.
Have a doughnut.
How do you know Graciella Rivers?
She' s an acquaintance.
That' s all.
If you guys aren' t gonna have one, I' m gonna have one.
Look.
I don' t care what her sister told you, Mr. Former FBI Profiler.
This ain' t the type of case you like.
This ain' t a glamorous case that will get headlines.
This isn' t Charles Manson or Ted fucking Bundy.
This is an ordinary convenience- store robbery.
Some idiot with a gun...... with the right ratio of balls to brains pulled the trigger.
I told her I' d check it out.
You' ve been on this a while, and a fresh pair of eyes won' t hurt.
I won' t grandstand anybody.
I' il give any information to you first.
I' m not trying to one- up anyone.
What do you want?
A copy of the murder book and a video walk- through of the scene.
- No can do.
- Why not?
How often does the sister call you?
Every day, weekends, holidays...
Believe it or not, we got feelings.
It hurts me to tell her there are no leads or suspects.
I can get her off your case.
I tell her I looked into it, you' re doing a good job, she stops calling.
You were always good at a crime scene.
But the key word is "were." Are you still?
You just give me a copy of the tape, that' s all.
We got more than just the crime- scene tape.
We' ve got the crime.
Bring the doughnuts.
Come on.
That' s Kyungwon Kang, the owner.
He' s about to make his last sale.
She comes in to buy a candy bar.
Yeah, for her kid.
And here he is.
Ba- da- bing!
He picked up all the shells.
Won' t see this on America 's Favorite Videos<
- There' s no sound on that camera?
- Right.
He' s just talking to himself.
- Could you run it in slow motion?
It' s not over.
Watch.
This guy goes up and down the aisles, looking for bandages, I guess.
Couldn' t find any, so he used paper towels to wrap her head.
The camera never really gets a good look at him.
After he' s finished, he goes outside, he dials 911...... and splits.
The voice was Latino.
Yeah.
That' s too bad.
He probably got a look at the car or the shooter.
Nothing.
- May I?
- Knock yourself out.
Pushing the pause button ain' t gonna help her.
$32 in the cash register.
Look at that.
He winked.
What?
Yeah.
Well, there you have it, Mr. FBI Guy.
Tell us something we don' t know.
The shooter' s been in the store before.
He knew the placement of the camera.
He' s from the neighborhood, or he just cased the place.
This isn' t the first time either.
No emotion, no panic, policed up his own brass.
This guy' s done it before.
What?
How many others?
Let me look at the murder book.
We have to talk to our lieutenant.
We' il be in touch.
- When?
- Give me a number.
We' il be in touch!
You guys can keep the doughnuts.
We don' t need your doughnuts or your shit!
We got enough of our own!
- Mrs. Kang?
I know you?
No.
I heard what happened here.
Your husband and all.
I' m sorry.
Yes, thank you.
The only way to keep evil out is not unlock door.
We can' t do that.
- We must have business.
Thank you, ma' am.
You gonna pay me, or should I drive you somewhere else?
Nearest public library.
Detective Winston said to wait here.
She' il be right with you.
Well, well, well, Terry McCaleb.
- Hi.
- As I live and breathe.
Look at you.
Look at you.
I hear you got a new ticker.
That' s right.
I' m all right, though.
How are you doing, babe?
Me?
You know, same old, same old.
So, what' s up?
You on a private ticket now?
No.
Just doing a favor for a friend.
What case is it?
James Cordell.
ATM holdup.
Let' s see.
January 22.
Newspaper says he was shot by a guy wearing a ski mask.
Who' s this friend you' re doing the favor for?
Graciella Rivers.
Her sister was shot in a store two weeks after.
Also a man in a ski mask.
Am I right?
Are they connected?
Yeah.
Same guy.
Out of your orbit, though.
Three- strikes shit, that' s all.
What do you mean?
Guy has two felonies, third puts him away for life.
So he kills any witnesses.
Robbery, murder, it' s all the same sentence for him either way.
I talked to the boys over at L. A. P. D., and they showed me a tape...... but they wouldn' t copy me the murder book.
I' il bet they copied you, though.
Come on, darling, you owe me just one little one.
I know that.
When you handed me the Cemetery Man bust...... you were my membership into this boys club.
I haven' t forgotten.
Does that mean yes?
Terry McCaleb.
Lucky for us the bank had two cameras on this.
The shooter' s back there.
I' m betting the mask isn' t on yet, or Cordell would have run.
H& K 9mm, same model used in the Valley tape.
Hold that.
Back it up a little bit.
Look, he' s saying something.
He talked there too.
Yeah, he' s a real chatterbox.
Did you get a lip reader in?
I' il get on it.
What about his cartridge?
Did he pick up his brass?
Yeah, there he is.
James Lockridge.
Pulled into the bank lot, almost got sideswiped by a sedan.
Says it was a white guy, but nothing else.
He called for the ambulance.
Cordell died going to the hospital.
You got any leads at all?
No, I' m following the three- strike thing.
I think the man in the ski mask is one of those.
What about the gun?
H& K' s expensive for a holdup man.
That' s weird he' d keep it after the first killing.
I thought about that.
I figure he stole it, but that lead me nowhere.
I don' t know.
I think we' il need fresh blood to solve this one.
Well, Jaye...... why don' t you get me a copy of the book?
Both yours and L. A. Could you?
I' il ask the captain.
I don' t see why not.
He was the lieutenant on the Cemetery Man case.
Yeah, I kind of remember that.
I' m glad someone got promoted.
- Right here.
- Thanks.
Mr. Lockridge, Terry McCaleb.
Are you a policeman?
No, retired FBl.
I' m investigating a related case for a victim' s family.
- Why?
- Didn' t they tell you?
Why would they?
When I found the guy, I call 911, right?
They sent the ambulance to the wrong place.
Took them 20 minutes.
He might have made it if they hadn' t screwed up.
- Those things happen.
- No.
They screwed up.
A guy died.
End of story.
I' m busy.
I agreed to see you because you' re already here, so...... what do you want?
I thought you' d give your statement to me firsthand.
I needed cash.
As I pulled up, the guy driving out almost hits me.
All I saw was a car.
There were no plates, no face, nothing.
I walk up to the ATM, and there' s this guy bleeding.
I figured he got it right before I got there, so I called 911.
Ten minutes later, they come, driving right fucking past us.
Past us.
Any other details?
It could' ve been me.
Could' ve been him finding me...... with the ambulance driving right on fucking by.
Good stuff.
You done?
Yeah.
Hey, Buddy.
Here' s to you.
Semper fi, auld lang syne, keep on trucking.
You look like a skunk.
- What are you doing tomorrow?
Big, fat goose egg.
I could use a driver. $10 an hour and meals.
- What' s up?
An investigation?
- I just need a driver, not a partner.
I' m in.
Whose car?
If we take yours, I' il buy gas, or I' il sit in the back in mine...... because of the air bags.
Yeah.
Let' s take mine.
That way I won' t feel like a chauffeur.
See you in the a. m.
You look tired, Terry.
You should get some sleep!
You don' t deserve it.
First of all, I have no idea where your heart came from.
All BOPRA tells us is they have an organ...... with a match to someone on the list.
In your case, we told you what we knew.
Female, 32, perfect health, perfect blood typing, perfect donor.
She was murdered.
Murdered?
What are you talking about?
She was shot during a robbery and lived long enough for me to get her heart.
How do you know?
You' re not supposed to know about the donor.
Her sister found me.
She read about how I had a rare blood type like her sister...... and that my surgery was on the day she died.
What does she want?
Money?
I' m glad you can find it funny.
She wants me to solve the murder.
Give me this woman' s name right now.
- You' re not thinking of doing this?
- I started yesterday.
And today you' re running a fever!
You are 60 days post- transplant!
As your doctor, I' m ordering you not to do this.
- Respect the gift you were given.
It was her gift.
She' d be dead either way.
You don' t owe her.
It was supposed to be an accident.
99 out of 100 of these are head injuries that end up fatal.
This one is different.
How is it different?
A heart' s a heart!
Murder is evil.
Please.
I wouldn' t have this gift if somebody hadn' t done this hateful, evil thing.
You' re not making sense.
She goes into a store to buy a candy bar for her kid.
I can' t explain it.
Terry, sit down.
- You know that little boy in room 218?
He' s waiting for a heart that isn' t coming.
That could be you.
This is your one chance, Terry.
You tell that woman no.
You save yourself and tell her no!
I can' t.
You' re gambling with your life.
You get infection or rejection, there' s nothing we can do.
- Neither do I.
I can' t be your doctor.
Come on, doc.
I' il have your records ready in the morning.
Good luck, Terry.
Make it quick.
Hello?
This is McCaleb.
What' s going on?
Tell me about her.
What do you mean?
Just tell me something about Gloria.
The more I know, the more I can get a handle on this thing.
Do you have a kitchen on the boat?
A galley, yeah.
Is it big enough to cook a real meal?
Yeah, sort of.
You want to know my sister, you' il have to meet her son.
He' s everything that was good about her.
It' s in him.
I' il bring him by later, and I' il make you dinner.
I' d like that.
Then you can give me an update.
Look, just so you know it, these cases usually turn on some small detail.
Something someone forgot or didn' t think was important.
That' s the key.
I' il have to find it.
You have Glory' s heart.
She' il guide you.
Thanks.
Quick enough?
- Yeah.
- Huh?
- Dandy.
Let me stop by the In- N- Out on Victory.
I don' t think they serve hamburgers here.
What' s up?
The sheriff' s office listed all the three- strikes robbery suspects.
They also made a list of every H& K P7 pistol stolen in the last few years.
I charted that list plus the address...... and the work location of every man on the list.
- Exactly.
One guy stands out like a whore in church, and that' s Mikail Bolotov.
He' s a two- time loser, lives a mile from where Gloria Torres was shot...... and works four blocks from where an H& K was stolen in December.
Why didn' t they arrest this Polo, Bolo...?
- Bolotov.
Oh, a Russian son of a bitch!
They don' t know about the pistol.
It seems he has a good alibi.
It' s his timecard.
He punched out after the Cordell murder.
- A friend could have done that.
- Yeah, true.
I still don' t know why we' re here.
This is where he works.
I' m gonna go have a talk with him.
- Cool.
- Where are you going?
You go after him, I pull you off.
- No.
Stay with the car.
Starsky and Putz.
What are you expecting in there?
Nothing.
This is just for show.
Hold this.
Thanks.
Can I help you?
My name is McCaleb.
Following up the sheriff' s department investigation of February 3.
Just a minute, please.
Mr. Toliver?
A Mr. McCaleb from the sheriff' s department is here.
- We' re awfully busy, Mr. McCaleb.
- I' il get right to the point, then.
A few months ago, some deputies asked you about an employee.
- Bolotov?
- Yes.
I' d like to get a few more points.
I' il tell you what I told them.
Bolotov was working that day.
You can see his timecards.
How many employees do you have here at one time?
Eighty- five.
Is it possible that one of them might have punched his timecard for him?
We' ve been in business 16 years.
It' s happened.
Is he here today?
Yes, that' s him over there.
Bolotov.
That' s Russian, right?
They' re good workers and don' t complain.
They don' t mind being paid shit.
- I' d like to talk to him.
- In here?
You want to maintain your cooperation with the sheriff' s office, don' t you?
Yeah, all right.
Bolotov, up in the office.
Mr. Bolotov.
Have a chair.
Where were you on the night of January 22?
I told them before.
I worked that night.
I know, but we know things now that we didn' t know then.
What things?
There was a burglary on Mason Street, about four blocks from here.
- Is that where you got the gun?
- What gun?
And February 7, I suppose you got an alibi for that night too.
I don' t know that night.
'Course you do!
That' s the night you went into Kang' s grocery store and killed two people.
Who are you?
You' re not a cop.
Who are you?
I' m the Lone Ranger.
Now sit down.
No badge.
See?
No cop.
"Terrell McCaleb."
Maybe one day, I pay you visit.
Yes?
Not now.
I' il get back to him.
Bolotov' s alibi isn' t solid.
Think about it.
Even if you had a badge, it' d be the wrong one.
I like him for this.
Bolotov' s an ex- con.
He could have done that for any reason.
You should still put out a pickup.
- Who the hell are you?
- Sort of.
- Great.
Let' s get back to Bolotov.
I' ve already sent a car to his apartment.
He' s gone.
I hit a nerve.
Remember my lieutenant, who' s now my captain?
He' s unhappy.
He doesn' t want to hear from you again.
Terry has worked very hard on this.
We both have.
Shut up.
Also...... he wants the tapes and murder books back first thing in the morning.
Will that give you enough time to copy everything?
Thanks.
Go home, you look like crap.
Wait a minute.
Lip reader is 90°% ° certain the shooter was saying, "Happy Valentine' s Day."
Happy Valent...
That doesn' t sound like your average three- strikes guy, does it?
What' s the average these days?
Not much, man.
Happy Valentine' s Day.
Do you see the boat?
I told you.
- How much homework do you have?
- Three questions.
- Hey.
You forgot, didn' t you?
Sort of.
I kind of got lost the last couple hours.
We can do this another time.
No, we' re having dinner.
Come on up.
- Is this Raymond?
- This is Raymond.
This is the man I was telling you about.
- How are you doing? hat' s The Following Sea<
That' s the one that you have to watch for, the one right behind you.
- Where' s the kitchen?
I mean, galley?
- Right in here.
- Can you fish off this boat?
- Yeah, you can.
Come on back, I' il get you a fishing pole.
Jesus.
I didn' t want you to see that.
Was she...?
Was she ever scared?
No, she never knew anything.
What I' ve asked you to do, it just isn' t fair.
Is it?
There' s a restaurant in the marina.
Good atmosphere, view of the sunset.
Why don' t I just take you to dinner there.
Why do you live on a boat?
I hate mowing lawns.
Why do you live onshore?
Because that' s where my warm, cozy apartment is.
You were right, though.
It' s a great sunset.
Yeah, you never get tired of it.
Does he stay with you?
His dad isn' t around.
He' s a great kid.
Your sister must have been a good woman.
Thank you.
So how is it going, McCaleb?
Any hope?
Start thinking about your sister...... who her friends were, where she went, all of her routines.
- All right.
How come?
- That' s just an angle I' m working on.
Did she ever know a James Cordell?
- Cordell?
- Yeah.
No.
- You sure?
- Positive.
Why?
It may be nothing.
It might be premature...
You think this James Cordell killed her.
No, nothing like that.
Stop, McCaleb, with the prematures and the angles.
What?
Cordell was killed at an ATM machine two weeks before your sister died.
We think it' s the same gunman in both cases.
Why would she know Cordell?
They were both in the wrong place at the wrong time.
This investigation' s being conducted under the theory...... that the locations were chosen and the victims were random.
It' s the other way around.
It' s not where that' s important.
It' s who.
- Gunman took money, so it' s robbery...
- Bear with me.
Cordell and your sister were connected.
There' s some intersecting link between them and the killer.
I' m not following you.
At the Bureau, we used to call this a full- field investigation.
- That' s what I' m conducting here.
- Full- field investigation.
Okay.
Come on!
You know, there was one thing that' s always bothered me.
- What?
- Nothing, but...
What is it?
Glory had this piece of jewelry she always wore.
Like a good- luck charm.
She never took it off.
When the police brought me her effects, it was missing.
What was it?
It was a single earring, a dangling crucifix.
Okay.
So, what does it mean?
Nothing.
Some killers take souvenirs, I suppose.
- That' s sick.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I gotta get back to the boat for my medicine.
We have to get going too.
Raymond has some homework.
Raymond?
We' ve gotta go!
Say thank you to Mr. McCaleb.
Come!
Thank you!
- Say thank you.
- Thank you.
- See you later.
And he takes the earring.
Hey, Buddy!
What' s up?
You' re working tomorrow, 6 a. m.
Whatever.
Who wants to go to the desert anyhow?
We go where the clues lead.
Don' t any clues lead to the beach?
They lead where they lead.
Usually pretty close to where they started.
I have to ask, Terry.
How did it feel?
Back in the day, when you were going up against all those sickos?
That was my job.
Come on, man.
I mean, driving a truck, that' s a job.
All those killers you used to hunt down.
I read in the paper some used to leave you messages.
That ain' t truck driving.
Only one, actually, ever left me messages.
Sorry, I' m sticking my nose in it, I know.
Connected.
What?
When I was at the top of my game, I felt connected to everything.
The victim, the killer, the crime scene.
Everything.
Just felt like it was all part of me.
It' s beginning to feel that way again.
Cool.
I' il tell you what.
Driving is okay because I would shit my shorts.
I would.
A loser.
Buddy, you' re not a loser.
It' s okay, Terry.
Only my mom has to tell me that.
My friends can tell me the truth.
Mrs. Cordell?
I' m Terry McCaleb.
I called you.
Is this a bad time?
- As opposed to a good time?
- Poor choice of words.
Can we talk?
Is that your partner in the car?
Yeah.
I wanted to hire an investigator, but I couldn' t afford to.
Couldn' t afford to find out who killed him.
You work for the police?
No, I' m a retired FBI agent.
I' m also a friend of the family of the woman killed in Canoga Park.
We think it' s the same gunman.
I see.
I' d like to tell you I' m sorry.
That' s hard coming from a stranger...... but I went through the files, and James seemed like a good man.
Funny hearing him called James.
Everyone called him Jimmy.
And he was a very good man.
How can I help, Mr. McCaleb?
See this photograph?
Does this woman look familiar to you?
- Is that someone he might have known?
- I don' t think so.
- Is that the victim from Canoga Park?
- Right.
Is that her son?
I don' t understand.
How could he know her?
Are you suggesting they...?
- No, nothing like that.
- Then, like what?
We think your husband and Miss Torres may have crossed paths with the killer...... sort of the relationship between the victim and the gunman.
The smallest detail of them coming in contact is very, very important.
Something like dining at the same restaurant, for instance.
- Yeah.
That sounds like stalking, not robbery.
To be honest with you, we' re not sure robbery is the motive in this case.
When they brought back his effects, was it all there?
Was anything missing?
Rings, watches?
No.
You' re sure he couldn' t have been in the Valley two weeks before?
No, he spent a month in Northern California, working on the aqueduct.
And when my husband wasn' t working, he was home with me.
- Is that his car?
- Yes.
Any personal effects in that?
A picture on the dashboard.
- I don' t know.
I would think.
The sheriff' s department drove it home.
I haven' t been in it.
Can I...?
There it is.
Any of this stuff your husband' s favorite knickknacks?
No, sorry.
Could you jot down your husband' s routines for me...?
- What?
They hung from the mirror on a cord.
They' re missing.
What kind of glasses?
They were Wayfarers.
He had them for years.
- Wayfarers?
- What do you think it means?
I said, what do you think it means?
Probably nothing.
Thanks, Mrs. Cordell.
I' il call you if anything comes up.
Easy, Mac.
What' s the matter?
- You okay?
- Yeah, I' m okay.
I saw the killer, Buddy.
At the bank, at the ATM, where Cordell was killed.
Wait a minute, that' s crazy.
That' s the last place he would be.
No, it fits the profile.
Profile?
What profile?
Take me to the L. A. County Sheriff' s Office.
No, wait!
I don' t get it.
Why would the killer go back?
Never mind, I' il just drive.
- Now you' re starting to get it.
- This goes any longer, I want a raise.
How about workmen' s comp?
Detective Winston' s in the field.
Can I take a message?
- Tell her McCaleb was by.
- Hey.
She wanted to see you, Mr. McCaleb.
How about that?
I' m en route.
You should get yourself down here ASAP<
What was that first part?
I said, we' ve got Bolotov<
- Stay there, Buddy.
- This sucks!
Trash collectors found him.
We think he' s been here since early a. m.
- What are they doing here?
- This alley is the line.
South side' s L. A. P. D., north is sheriff' s department.
We' re not sure who has jurisdiction yet.
Congratulations, old man!
You shook him out of his tree.
H& K 9mm.
Same as both murders.
I bet ballistics confirms it.
- What are you talking about?
- He' s saying this case is closed.
- A serial killer.
This guy stalks his victims and kills them on camera...... then he takes trophy items.
- What are you talking about?
I was at the ATM crime scene.
The killer was behind me.
He had Cordell' s glasses on, and he had Gloria Torres' earring.
Did they look like these?
This?
And this?
I don' t care what you call him.
We got him.
- Maybe it was a wig?
Maybe.
- You wanna sit down?
- I' m fine, goddamn it.
- Why don' t you lay down?
- Arrango, shut up!
There' s something in his mouth.
- It' s a bullet.
- No way it came from a 9mm.
- Looks like a. 38 to me.
- Why' d he put a. 38 slug in his mouth?
Same reason he died on the jurisdiction line.
Somebody' s trying to jerk us all off.
Personally, I like being jerked off.
This case is closed in my book.
You' re just worried, aren' t you?
- Yeah.
About what?
That I might bust this case.
You don' t care who gets hurt or killed.
- As long as I don' t bust the case.
- What the fuck is it to you anyway?
Gloria Torres, that victim you didn' t give a shit about?
That' s what.
That' s right.
I' m alive because she' s dead.
That puts me in this bigtime.
You' re an asshole, and you can' t help it, but I' m on this case for a while.
I' il be along until we get him.
I don' t care whether it' s you, him or whoever.
I' m in this.
Stay out of my city!
Go get yourself a dick transplant!
Conflict of interest.
- Pain in the ass.
- How much do I owe you?
- I don' t know, 200 or so.
That sounds right.
- Take a check?
- Yeah, sure.
You look like shit.
You should take a nap.
I will.
- Who do I make it out to?
- Jasper.
Jasper Noone.
N- O- O- N- E.
I know the Noone part.
But Jasper?
Yeah.
Take a nap.
Ray, stay out here.
Be careful of the edges.
I' il be right out.
- Hi.
- Hey.
So is it true?
What?
I heard it on the news.
They said that they found a Russian man...... who may be the killer.
I don' t know.
I don' t think so, but I don' t know.
They said they had evidence that could link this guy to both murders.
That may just be two cops trying to grab headlines.
Sorry.
You' re starting to sound like L. A. P. D.
I need some answers.
Because no one knows...
No one has a clue what that boy goes through every night without his mother.
I' m sorry.
I did what you asked.
I made a list of all of Glory' s routines.
That' s good.
She used to go to that market almost every night.
Too much.
The one on Ventura and Reseda.
And she would go bowling, but not lately.
She used to visit an aunt every Thursday...... because our aunt was in a nursing home in Culver City.
Like a responsible person, she never missed a day of work.
She gave blood every month, took her son to school...... and I wanna understand why she was killed!
What?
She gave blood?
Yes, McCaleb.
She' s the same blood type as you are.
AB with a CMV negative.
The hospital would have paid her, but she wouldn' t accept money.
- That' s the connection!
- What are you talking about?
Blood.
Wait a minute.
Blood?
I' il cover tomorrow' s shift.
Yeah, thanks.
- Don' t you ever use a cell phone?
- I don' t believe in them.
I always stay with a hard line.
Mrs. Cordell wasn' t home.
Is there another way to find out?
- Which computer?
- The BOPRA computer.
There' s one at L. A. Memorial.
- All right.
I' m coming with you.
- Get somebody to stay with the kid.
What do you think?
What do you mean, babysitting?
- Fuck me.
How much?
Beer.
A case of beer an hour.
You got it.
Hey, doc.
Terry.
What' s wrong?
Nothing.
Is there a place we could talk privately?
I need to talk to you.
You have five minutes.
Who' s this?
Graciella Rivers, the one I told you about.
She' s the one who put you up to this.
Look at him.
Look at his color.
Look at the lines under his eyes.
A week ago, he was perfect.
- It was my choice.
Shut up!
Sit down.
Open your mouth.
Lift your shirt up.
- What do you want?
- We wanted to know...
- Keep that thermometer in your mouth.
- My sister was murdered.
So was another man.
It was the same killer.
McCaleb found a link between my sister and this other man.
- They both gave blood.
- What?
She was the same blood type as McCaleb, AB with CMV negative.
McCaleb says that' s 1 in 200.
101.
Shit.
What do you want?
I want you to access the BOPRA computer.
If Cordell' s on it, I wanna know his blood type.
That' s unethical.
You' ve gotta help.
If I' m right, the killer already has access.
I don' t know...
If you can' t protect the integrity of the system, there' s no system.
All right.
I' il do it on one condition.
What' s that?
Let me run blood work on you.
- That will take all day!
- Yes or no?
- Yes.
- Sit down.
I' il get the nurse.
Very still now.
We' re almost done.
I want you to stop, McCaleb.
Stop what?
Everything.
I was wrong to bring this to you.
No.
Yeah.
Glory gave another person life.
- That' s really all I need to know.
Look, I got a new heart, but...... I didn' t necessarily get a new life.
I don' t know what you mean.
I lost a little something...... but knowing you and working with you on this...... I feel a little bit coming back.
Okay.
It' s a list of the local AB CMV negatives.
Cordell' s on it.
Same blood type as Torres.
What' s the D stand for?
Deceased?
No, donor.
Organ donor.
They were both organ donors.
Both organ donors?
- That' s crazy.
- What are you saying?
I missed it, damn it.
I didn' t think Gloria had anything anyone wanted, but I missed it.
What did you miss?
Her blood.
It made her unique.
To someone.
Someone like me.
Wait a minute.
You' re saying that she was murdered for her organs.
The autopsy report had both bullets going through the frontal lobe.
That could leave them brain dead, but not die right away.
Of course, Cordell... 911 screwed up, but your sister had the Good Samaritan.
Who?
That' s the customer who came in, bandaged her head and called 911.
- You can' t get back until...
- Can I use your phone?
Get a list of where all the organs went, will you?
Detective Jaye Winston?
Graciella Rivers.
He' s inside talking about surveillance and numbers.
This is Arrango from West Valley Homicide.
Badge 14110.
I' d like a 10- 20 for a surveillance commencement.
14: 39<
Thank you.
What' s up?
The surveillance camera' s three seconds behind the CCW clock.
- That' s the one 911 uses.
- Okay, so?
So did you bring the tape?
This is the 911 operator<
The girl is shot very bad!
She needs help!
Who was shot, sir?
The girl is shot!
Sir, please stay on the line<
That' s 10: 40: 58.
All right.
At 22: 41: 37...... Gloria is shot.
Jump down to...... 22: 42: 55, and here comes Good Samaritan.
That son of a bitch.
What?
What is it?
This guy here...... this unidentified Good Samaritan, who tried to help Gloria.
There' s just one problem.
What' s that?
The clock on the surveillance camera is three seconds behind the 911 clock.
All right, and...?
We think he made the call before he killed her.
No.
No, that doesn' t make any sense, because the numbers...
The caller.
It' s the same guy.
He called an ambulance before he shot her.
Yeah.
See, Cordell, his organs were no good.
This time, the shooter would make sure the ambulance got a good lead.
So he shot Gloria, then he comes back with bandages...... and tries to keep her alive.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
Could this Good Samaritan be the same guy you saw at the ATM machine?
I don' t know.
Put a wig on him, maybe.
A little dark makeup, he' s Hispanic.
No.
You only told me to bring this one.
The shooter probably had them on the way anyway.
They went to the wrong address, so it doesn' t matter.
What do you think about Lockridge for this?
I don' t know, maybe.
Whoever got the list of organ donors had to hack into the BOPRA computer.
Lockridge is a computer man, right?
Let' s go.
I have to go with you.
Take my car.
I' il go with Jaye.
Why don' t you pop the trunk?
I' il put this stuff in the back.
What the fuck is he doing?
McCaleb!
What are you doing?!
What' s going on?
- Yeah.
You okay?
- Yeah.
- Let' s go find Lockridge at work.
What do you mean?
We just shot up the Valley.
Did you hit anyone?
- No, thank God.
- Neither did I. Let' s go.
Mr. Lockridge didn' t come to work today.
- Is he ill?
- He hasn' t called...... and he didn' t come in yesterday either.
Come here and look at this.
Doesn' t that look like probable cause to you?
Let' s go.
See if I remember how they did this.
Shit.
Her throat' s been slit.
She' s been here a good 24 hours.
You okay?
Yeah.
We got an APB out on Lockridge.
I might get suspended, but you did real good, McCaleb.
Real good.
I hope so.
I guess I' d better get home and get my pills.
Want some coffee?
No, go home.
Get your pills.
You still got company.
How much beer do I owe you?
Seven cases...... but since he' s a good kid and a great fisherman, I' il take two.
I' il get you the check in the morning.
That' s what they all say.
Good night, Terry.
- Hey, Mr. McCaleb.
Howdy.
- How are you?
Me and Buddy caught so many fish he had to get more bait.
- Really?
It must be a harbor record.
It' s "Buddy and I." Finish your homework, Ray.
So?
Okay.
When will you know?
Soon, hopefully.
Thank you.
For everything you' ve done.
I' m impressed.
That' s my dad.
He used to take Glory and me fishing.
A lot.
When we were kids.
You know, they' re all gone.
But I' m glad I can still smile about her, you know?
I couldn' t at first.
This is a cool gun, Mr. McCaleb.
- It' s all over.
Don' t, no.
You never, never touch a gun.
See?
You can look at it.
This is an eight- shot Smith & Wesson.
We don' t touch it.
I shouldn' t have left it out.
Understand?
What' s this?
Oh, that' s some code I was supposed to break, but I never could do it.
- There' s no one.
- What?
There' s no 1.
"9- 0- 3- 4- 7- 2- 5- 6- 8."
It' s all the numbers, but no 1.
No 1 s.
Little man, come on.
We have to go.
It' s getting late.
- Can I stay?
- We gotta go.
It' s getting late.
- I don' t want to.
Okay?
Were you just going to let me sit here and eat alone?
Raymond loves this boat, and he was wondering if he could spend the night.
Yeah, there' s a berth in front you can both share.
You don' t have to hide it.
Show me your heart.
Show me.
- Somebody' s up on deck.
- I don' t know.
Somebody' s up there.
- Raymond.
No, too heavy for him.
- You son of a bitch!
Jesus Christ!
We came because the captain wants you at the crime scene.
When this is over...... you better get an ass transplant because I' il tear you a new one!
Damn, it' s cold.
There' s McCaleb.
Mr. McCaleb, did you think this was over?
I can' t comment, I don' t know anything about anything.
- Oh, no.
- What?
This is where I had my attack.
Lockridge.
James Lockridge, the guy who found Cordell at the ATM machine.
Looks like your Code Killer' s back.
Happy Valentine' s Day.
Way to make a comeback.
Some people get flowers, some people get chocolates.
You get a dead guy.
- What' s going on?
Paper said something you didn' t like?
Ballistics will match this slug with the one in Bolotov' s mouth.
It was the Code Killer.
Torres, Cordell, Bolotov, all of them.
What does that mean?
I shot him two years ago.
The slug in Bolotov' s mouth is the one that hit him.
Now I' m back...... and so is he.
Every second we' re talking, you could be trying to get this son of a bitch.
We got a lot of good people out there.
Better chance of breaking this with you in here.
- Fuck you, Bureau man!
- Enough of that, detective.
Yes, sir.
This Code Killer likes to impress you.
I had a media profile, so did he.
I guess he missed the matchup, me and him on the news every night.
I thought once these guys started, they didn' t stop.
But your Codie' s been down for two years.
What do you make of that?
I don' t know.
I shot him.
I always figured he crawled off and died.
- What do the numbers mean?
- Don' t know that either.
We ran it by the computers at Cal, by the code breakers at the NSA.
Except...
Except what?
There' s no digit number one.
No 1, whatever that might mean.
Guys, step out.
Give us a minute.
Okay.
Just cop to cop, what' s going on here?
Cordell, Gloria Torres...
He did them for me.
Keep talking until I understand.
He missed the action.
Me and him.
In order to get it back, I needed a new heart, so...... Happy Valentine' s Day.
Holy shit.
Now the love letters are gonna start, hot and heavy.
You might have the captain fooled, but not me.
That makes you suspect number one.
What a waste of a good Mexican' s heart!
Get out of here.
Graciella?
Raymond?
Hey, Ter!
Welcome to Davy Jones' locker.
Have you seen Graciella and Raymond?
They got tired of waiting for you.
They left about an hour ago.
You' re all over the news, brother!
How long we been neighbors?
I don' t know.
I moved into the marina about a week after you.
- Raise up your shirt.
Raise it up.
Now.
Come on, turn around.
I' m the following sea, man.
I' m the one you need to watch out for.
When did you figure it out?
On the check.
"No one."
I had a little trouble with the Jasper part.
I could' ve killed you if I wanted to.
I was behind you at the ATM.
I followed you to Kang' s Market, just like I followed Gloria Torres.
You sick son of a bitch.
I studied her.
I chose her.
She was my valentine to you.
I gave you life.
What else you wanna know?
That necklace belonged to a girl named Sunny.
Lockridge' s wife.
There' s a story for every piece of crap on that tray.
Come on, man.
You' re mine forever.
Every breath you take belongs to me.
Every beat of that stolen heart is the echo of my voice in your head.
Every day.
Always.
It depends on you.
Pull that trigger, you' il never see them again.
- What?
- Kill me, no one will find them.
They will die.
Alone.
In a black hole.
And that will be on you.
You know me.
You know I have them.
- What do you want?
- I want you to live.
I want me to live.
I want it all to start again, you know, the battle between good and evil.
Can' t you see I' ve been getting you back to where you need to be?
I' m not interested.
Bullshit.
That day in the car, what did you say you felt?
What was the word?
You felt "connected." Shit.
I almost came when you said that.
Because that' s us, Terry.
That' s you and me.
It' s us.
We were meant to be.
We' re Cain and Abel.
Kennedy and Oswald.
We are shit in the bottom of somebody' s shoe.
I have to leave now.
And you' re not gonna follow me.
You' re not gonna scrape me off.
You' il sit by that pay phone and wait for me to call you from time to time...... and when I' m relocated and ready, I' il let Graciella and Raymond go.
Then you and me, we can start again.
I hope you think of me as often as I think of you.
Crazy!
Call an ambulance!
You' re gonna take me to them.
That will pinch the artery, and you won' t bleed to death.
- Now, show me.
- Okay.
What' s it like having a chick' s heart?
You start watching soaps?
Get cranky at the end of the month?
Hear some love song on the radio, you start crying?
Plus it' s a spic heart.
She was a wetback. wake up going, "Arriba!
Gotta some enchiladas for the cholita</ i
Shut up!
When they were girls going to Sunday school...... do you think Gloria Torres ever thought that her heart...... would be pumping blood through some guy that was banging her sister?
You don' t look so good, Ter.
You don' t look so good yourself there, Buddy.
Remember?
Salvage company' s gonna demo it next week.
Till then, it' s a perfect prison.
Better than Alcatraz.
My little shop of horrors.
Just so you know...... I would never hurt that little boy.
See, he' s the same blood type.
He' s the backup.
In case anything happens to his mom' s heart.
Come on.
With Graciella?
You think she can love you?
After her sister died for you?
That' s tough for her to get around.
Let' s go.
Let' s get going.
You can put the belt in your teeth.
Follow me.
In there.
The key.
Come on.
I knew you' d find us, Terry.
Let' s go.
- Yeah.
- My boat' s at the end of this gangway.
Wait a few minutes, then go on down there.
Use this knife to cut the lines.
- All right?
- Yeah.
If I don' t call you in a half- hour, get the hell out of here.
Get going.
Come on, honey.
I' m sad, Terry!
Get inside.
Hurry up.
Get down below, Raymond!
Come on, man.
We' re connected.
Think of what you' re doing.
You need me.
No, Buddy.
Remember how you said I was your friend and I could tell you the truth?
Well, I don' t need you at all.
Ten ring.
I saved you.
- Yeah.
Yeah, I' m okay.
Never felt better.
You got his ass.
Yeah, there' s "no one" anymore.
Give me a day to catch my breath, I' il write you a full report.
I want to see it.
Two of them okay?
Yeah, if everyone will leave them alone...... not get them any more involved.
- I' il see what I can do about that.
- That' s a pal.
How are you planning to deal with all this?
Well, I' ve got Gloria Torres' heart.
I' il probably just let that guide me.
- Excuse me?
Police work can get kind of heavy on you.
You got anyone at home?
Yeah, I got someone.
Good.
McCaleb!
I' m sick and tired of your grandstanding bullshit!
- You' re out of your jurisdiction.
- Maybe.
But just because you got a Mexican' s heart, it don' t make you one of us!
Arrango?
What?
You' re out of your goddamn mind!
All my life, I' ve had the shitty jobs.
You got him talking to himself.
I didn' t even know he spoke Spanish.
Poor baby, he' s been at this all morning.
I wish I could get a big, fat marlin and put it on his line.
I have very high ambitions.
We can do well if everything works down to the smallest detail.
That' s why I have to be very focused.
How best to prepare the riders?
Tour de France is so important for us -
- and... if we do it right, we' il make a difference.
I really envy them.
I miss the kick, and the feeling you get when your legs hurt.
But I also miss the feeling of being better than the rest.
Having your legs in good shape...... and being able to make it hurt for the others.
I really miss that a lot.
Fine.
Ride up behind the motorcycle.
Catch it.
Great.
Very good, Ivan.
After the motorcycle.
Catch it.
The last kilometer.
Come on!
Lance Armstrong.
Hunting his 6th victory.
Beautiful.
Come on, come on!
That' s a damn good time.
Many times you' re like this when you' re feeling tense.
It' s not easy.
I always spent a lot of time on my bike and my equipment.
So much, sometimes, that it broke down.
I was always trying to get as much as possible out of the components.
Then you screw a screw too tight.
Or a screw breaks -
- or a thread is wrecked.
If you don' t screw a screw too tight ten times -
- you' il never know how far you can screw.
You' re trying to make me say things that aren' t very good.
- I' m not making you say...
- No, it' s not that...
You shouldn' t be sorry about...
No, I' m not that good at talking about myself.
I can see that this team sounds a little strange.
That' s okay, too.
It' s apparently just my life' s work.
That' s about it.
Because that' s how it is.
That doesn' t necessarily make it less exciting.
For myself, either.
This has been...... a kind of a hurdle and has been for quite some time.
To get to the point where I' d allow myself do this.
I can' t let myself wonder or worry about -
- whether others approve of what I' m doing.
The greatest defeat is when others think you' re doing things wrong.
I just should have sprinted myself.
He wasn' t faster than me.
I don' t understand why he didn' t take charge.
I cycled my ass off.
I just should have ridden, myself.
Kim said I should stay on his tail.
- Stay on his tail?
- Then that prick came along.
You should have been much more cool.
- But then I...
- Already before.
- He got to ride, too.
- You were supposed to.
I did, when he went cold.
But he kept going, anyway.
But he was right on O' Grady' s ass.
I' il have to break away again.
- Not tomorrow.
- No, Jens will do that.
- I' m disappointed, Jakob.
- I don' t care.
- Why are you disappointed?
- I' m just kidding.
It was a joke.
Do I have any reason to be disappointed...?
No.
The yellow T- shirt is within reach.
Tomorrow you' re riding from the start, Piil...... as usual.
If he uses all that energy the first week...
If you hadn' t lost 9 minutes and were in a breakaway every day...
Those breakaways have put me in shape.
I' m impressed.
He' s a star.
He' il win Tour de France.
Maybe not this year, but one day.
Don' t tell him that.
- Excellent.
- It' s deep enough.
Dammit.
I couldn' t come under.
- I' m training...
- No, no no...
Oh, that.
It' s good.
It' s coming.
It' s before Tour de France, you know.
Well...
Yes.
You are my friend.
Hey, Piil?
There' il be no Tour de France for me.
I have to warm the milk bottles...... when the baby comes.
No.
I' m going to have twenty...
No, ten.
With me, eleven.
That' s enough for a football team.
- How' s it going?
- It' s going.
My throat' s not so bad, but in general...
- It went reasonably.
- Yes.
- No wind?
- We pulled through well.
Everyone was in front.
It was well ridden.
We can' t do anything with that wind.
We can' t come from behind.
Jesus Christ, Ivan.
Up in front!
Did you see the graphics?
- They have this comic book.
- I didn' t see it.
There' s this long field.
A big knife comes down with CSC on it -
- and sticks right through the field.
We' re not working for US Postal.
They' ve shown me this.
I understand nothing.
Here.
I' m taking it off.
It' s not helping.
Our doctor says you have to wear it for at least 5 days.
I don' t need it.
I' m not worried here, because, when I go out of the room -
- I feel certain I won' t be stabbed in the back.
On other teams, there' d be that chance.
That' s a crucial difference.
- You understand?
- I understand everything.
I understand him.
When the British talk, I understand nothing.
A language is something you sing.
One has to be able to understand when it' s sung.
- The intonation in the language...
- Yes, exactly.
I didn' t say one shouldn' t understand.
After 3 years with us you' il be speaking all languages.
He' s clever, isn' t he?
You know what this is about, right?
Ow, dammit.
He had the microphone here:
"I feel good."
We went to Hincapie and said:
"Lance, what do you think of the Tour?"
"Hey, Piil, come on.
Don' t you know who I am? "
We asked again:
"Okay, Lance..."
With the microphone here... like this.
He didn' t say anything.
Shall we bet Jens is breaking away?
I don' t think he is.
I' m in the first line.
I' m going to get going.
Yes...
Hi.
I know he needs help.
Of course he does, but how much can I help him?
I know I have to leave him alone.
I can' t push him too hard.
It' s a difficult balancing act to do the right thing for him -
- and it' s very hard to do the right thing for him just now -
- because he' s very frustrated.
That' s easy enough to understand.
It' s frustrating for us, too -
- because he' s an important man.
I go 360.
You know...
I know.
I tell you.
Hey, Bjarne.
I have ten kilos less than Ivan.
Ivan is 450.
I' m training.
Not racing.
And you also.
I' m not like this, Bjarne.
The computer needs to understand me.
I don' t need to understand it.
It' s more intelligent than me.
Yeah, yeah, for sure... not maybe.
I won' t force him.
Not at all.
I' il have to push him if nothing happens in a month' s time.
He has to make some decisions in his life.
He has to.
I can' t do it for him.
- There' s not much time.
- Not to do everything.
It' s difficult...
- We' re doing a lot.
- It' s necessary to work well.
If it works...
The most important is the time from Dauphiné Libéré to Tour de France.
Those are twenty very important days.
Polish everything up and achieve the maximum.
I feel pain.
This part and in the gluteus.
I don' t feel good.
I have pain.
I' m here because I have pain.
He' s feeling a bit strange right now.
I don' t know how great his need is.
He must assess what he' s capable of.
He can' t change what' s happened.
The problem is, there are too many people around him on the home front -
- who don' t understand that life goes on.
It' s a great strain on him.
He has to take them all into consideration -
- and you can' t do that as a professional bike rider.
You just can' t.
Nice work.
Nice work, Jakob.
My life' s greatest wish -
- was to ride together to the finish line in the mountains -
- and sprint for the win.
We had the chance in Vuelta de España 2001.
But in the interest of the team...
We were together in the breakaway.
But my team ordered me to wait for Joseba Beloki.
We could have shared that dream.
It wasn' t mine, alone.
José is someone with whom I' ve shared a lot.
He' s been like my big brother for the last eight years.
I' ve spent more time with him than with my own brothers.
He was someone I admired because of his perseverance.
- and with very little personality -
- but who have a lot of money.
It' s very attractive for these kinds of wolves -
- and people who don' t think like us.
We see the world in a different way.
We' re stubborn because it' s a hard sport.
But we' re not built for a world that is organized differently.
- it' s easy for them to destroy your life.
The first time I heard of his problem was a day earlier, in the media.
At one point I was afraid it was over.
For me, he' s one of the world' s absolute best bicycle riders.
He' s much better than people think...
Much better.
It requires more of you than just enjoying your sport.
It' s important for me -
- between Carlos and you.
Because if you show that you' re getting along well together -
- everyone' s happy.
It' s important for everyone.
- Otherwise there' il be two teams.
- I don' t want that to happen.
The two of them mean a lot to me personally -
- but also for the team.
They' re my two stars.
I have to feel my way.
It' s hard to have two, who in theory are competing against each other -
- become the best of friends.
My greatest wish -
- is for them to be able to see each other' s resources -
- and take advantage of them and make each of them better.
I will press them to give absolutely all they can.
You can often do much more than you think.
But the last thing I want to do is push them too far.
Danish CSC have now parked their bicycles -
- and French journalists are wondering how they succeeded.
That' s a direct accusation against me.
Yes.
It' s serious.
They should come to the training camp and see how we work -
- in December, January and February.
An Italian trainer has been named.
He has previously been under suspicion.
A French journalist says he' s a trainer for CSC.
One more question.
Is his name "Cecchini"?
He' s a very close friend.
A friend for life.
We develop many things together.
He trains some of my riders.
There' s very strict control.
I can' t tell you if there still are many who cheat.
I won' t reveal names.
I simply can' t.
My name would be ruined.
That' s why we have such strict rules.
That' s important.
I' ve spoken with a guy from Tour de France.
He says that tomorrow...... the whole story about Di Luca will be out.
3 more names will be made public tomorrow. lncluding yours.
- Mine?
- Yes.
Speak with Assano.
My case is finished and awaiting judgement.
I explained to him that it was a medicine for headaches.
Nothing more.
That' s all it is.
I said that if there were other things, you knew the consequences.
I' m sorry...... that my name has been involved again.
It' s not fair for the Tour, the team, or for me.
Unfortunately, in this sport...... if someone rides fast, it' s because...... they' re probably doing this and that.
What should we do about it?
The American, Lance Armstrong!
Right now I ought to be thinking about things like contracts -
- and sponsors, et cetera.
But I can' t handle it right now.
It' s a shame, because we' re in a situation with the sponsors -
- where I' m not completely free.
I can' t do what I' d like to do.
Where' s the balance?
How much do I have to sacrifice, myself?
It' s the fourth year, now.
I can' t keep making so many sacrifices and not get anything out of it.
That doesn' t put food on the table.
Up to the front, Ivan.
Now.
I haven' t been in the best shape, physically.
I' ve had headaches.
I don' t know exactly what it is.
It can be stress.
It can be so many things.
I' ve been having headaches...
No cars can get through here.
This is no good!
They can' t be so close behind.
Does he want to change bikes?
Try adjusting it.
- It' s sitting like this.
- Push him.
Andrea, do you want to change bikes, or what?
Come on, Andrea!
No bottle.
Why the hell did he go down there first?
The first day is just as intense for me as for the riders.
- You' il have to look, yourself.
- Yeah, yeah.
That was completely wrong.
It would be a good idea to test the bike first.
This has a lot to do with stress.
I know how fast everything can fall apart.
A big accident for CSC.
New problems.
Do you want to change bikes?
How are we going to be able to win?
This is Tour de France.
You don' t have a chance if you don' t use your head.
Jesus.
I can' t understand how he dares.
My god, what a sprint!
Look at this...
No!
It was Kurt.
Fuck!
Why didn' t you come before?
- I was down with Sabine.
- Haven' t you taken others, Ole?
- No.
He' s just arrived.
- Now an hour' s gone by.
There are some others who must be looked at.
- It' s very hard to tell...
- Then find another one, Ole.
Half an hour ago they said he' d come in 2 minutes.
Then you' d better find him.
He was three seconds behind.
We' ve just lost a minute.
If you' re not together with the group, you get the real time to Armstrong.
So he loses 45 seconds.
- A bit more.
- That can' t be true.
- It' s in the rules.
- He' s furious.
We' il have to protest.
If we made a complaint, what would it be based on?
That it' s hopeless to make the last 100 meters on cobblestones.
- So they should makes exceptions?
- Yes, I think so.
They' re the ones who decided to put the finish line there.
Ole, it doesn' t matter whether he' s four minutes behind, or forty.
Do you want a cup of coffee...?
Okay.
- You don' t want one either, Ole?
- No.
- Excuse me...
- Ole?
Ow, that hurts.
- Ow!
- It' s your bile.
That helped a lot.
To be quite honest -
- there have been...... some situations that have been hard for me to tackle.
I' ve known you for several years.
I think...... sometimes it takes so little -
- to make one feel -
- that it' s good one is here.
Try smiling.
But you know me, Ole.
I' ve never seen you like this, Bjarne.
I don' t know what it is.
I' m just focused.
I' m here to...
I think many of us take it as though there' s something' s wrong.
- That we' re doing something wrong.
- No.
- I' m glad to hear it.
- There isn' t.
It means a lot to me to know that what I do is good enough.
Otherwise you wouldn' t be here.
That' s why you' re here.
- You know that, too.
- Even though you' re stressed...
Just a little...
- Do you have so much on your mind?
- It' s filled up.
Then you have to let people know you need help.
That is...
I know you' re used to fighting alone.
But if things are too much...
A little sign.
Then we can help you.
We can' t do your work, but at least we feel we' re part of something.
You talk about teamwork, right?
- You need help, too.
- Yeah, yeah.
And support.
I' m saying this as a friend.
I' m afraid people feel rejected when you close yourself off like this.
That isn' t what you want, of course.
- They' re ready tomorrow.
- They have to be.
- We have to win.
- There' s the first one.
I' ve re- named him.
He' s not "the little bird".
Now he' s "the little eagle".
Eighteen days.
No, not at the moment.
She' s okay now.
She' s helping my wife.
When I spoke with her on the phone, she asked:
"When are you coming, Poppa?"
Are you nervous?
"Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers."
Can you say "Ole Kaare Føli"?
- "You are nice and beautiful."
- Am I nice and beautiful?
Yeah, I know.
Like a boxer.
It' s not easy.
C' est la vie.
You know, "C' est la vie"?
No.
"That' s life."
It' s French, Ole.
Tour de France isn' t the best time to close myself off.
That' s fine.
But if I need to sometimes, I should be allowed to.
I just need to be helped out of it again.
I can tell from my eyes that I' m tired.
It' s an incredibly hard sport.
Perhaps the hardest you can get into.
Maybe there are many who have learned how to fight -
- before they became professional bicycle riders.
I have.
Some people can' t live up to their expectations and those of others.
They create incalculable burdens for themselves.
There are those who are mentally unable to get a grasp on their lives.
They don' t get help at the right time.
They' re not good at asking for it.
They can' t pull themselves together when it' s necessary.
They become losers.
And then sometimes tragic things happen.
It' s a damn hard sport.
It requires willpower.
Everything can change in a split second.
This can' t happen.
I think Carlos called.
- I think Carlos called you.
- We can' t, right now.
Bobby had been looking forward to the Tour -
- and was on his way to a good result -
- for both himself and the team.
Suddenly it' s all lying on the asphalt.
I can' t ride anymore.
- Must you ride with that on tomorrow?
- I don' t want to.
- Tomorrow you shouldn' t.
- It' s better if it gets air.
It' il create too much wind resistance.
It has a hell of an effect on you.
Falling down, time after time.
Anyone else would have given up long ago.
It hurts here.
I have pain here.
I have pains in my stomach.
It' s not going to be easy today.
I' m completely wrecked.
I can' t pedal anymore!
Good, Jakob!
There' s only one thing to do...
You have to.
- What?
- You have to.
If you can' t ride, you can' t ride.
That' s all there is to it.
Are you going home?
Good luck.
Give 'em hell.
- I' il try.
- Don' t ride too much.
Hello.
Ivan broke down on the first rest day.
He was told his mother was seriously ill with cancer.
I tried to console him a bit.
We drove back to the hotel.
We agreed to assemble all the riders.
Ivan explained the situation.
He intended to continue.
It was very important that they trust each other.
They had to be loyal to him.
It' s important that they supported him.
You know what, Bjarne?
I' ve spoken to my mother.
If this is fate, what do I do now?
It' s hard not to see my daughter and wife for a month.
I prefer to see my daughter and my mother when I come home.
They say they' il give her chemotherapy so she' s not in pain.
But she' s getting closer to death every day.
Lance isn' t dumb.
He' s really cunning.
That' s why he' s won the Tour six times.
He' s a really good rider.
Really excellent.
But he also uses his head.
Tactically, he' s really clever.
Part of it is also a question of psychology.
I spoke with him yesterday.
- and at the end he said:
"If you stick with me Friday and Saturday, you' il end near the top."
Why?
He said he was going to win the Tour on Friday and Saturday.
He' s convinced he' il leave everyone behind.
- He' s going to win both stages...
- I know that.
It was important for me to be present.
I let him know that, whatever happens, we' re backing him up.
I always write some information about the stage -
- on my handlebars.
I usually also write down other things.
That day I wanted to win.
I wanted to create something meaningful -
- for the people who care about me.
There was my family situation in particular.
Try to do something for her.
That was the day she was supposed to begin the chemotherapy.
The 3 names are my mother' s, my wife' s and my daughter' s.
This way they' re close to me.
Ivan' s next to Armstrong, who' s attacking.
What a race.
The first time I attacked, it was to split the field -
- and to see who could keep such a fast pace up the mountain.
Armstrong has fallen back.
Ivan' s broken away with Mancebo.
There have been many important moments.
But the important thing here was that I had it all in my head.
I wasn' t very afraid -
- because I knew that Bjarne would help me.
At one point I saw a TV where there were three men in front.
My two boys, Ivan and Carlos, with Lance in the middle.
It was a great feeling.
Really great.
I was very proud.
Stay on his wheel.
Stay on his wheel, Ivan.
Ride, Ivan, ride.
Good!
Come on, Ivan!
Come on, Ivan.
Let' s go, Basso.
Show us what you can do.
Armstrong and Basso...
I think it was the greatest moment of my career.
Good, good, good!
That was amazing.
He didn' t even look tired.
May I borrow your telephone?
Call my wife and tell her Ivan won.
Ivan won.
Armstrong came in second.
Hello, Mom.
It' s me.
Are you alone?
Perfect...
Perfect.
Good, good...
- Hi.
Thank you.
- That was beautiful.
- Congratulations.
- And to you, too.
Very happy.
Because he tried a lot.
I saw him...
I asked him because I saw he was really good.
He was in the right position.
So I tried.
The others, like Tyler Hamilton, were finished.
- What do you say, Bjarne?
- Fantastic.
- That was lucky.
- Now you don' t need rubber bands.
- Are you happy, Ivan?
- Yes.
We' ve got a chance if we keep on like this.
It went great, of course.
But it sure as hell wasn' t easy.
I could see that right away.
Well, but...
- You were tenacious.
- Yes, I' m satisfied.
We handled things well.
I' ve spoken with one of Armstrong' s friends.
He gave me a number.
- What did Lance say?
- He was glad you were there.
Because...... everyone knows it was an important day for you.
- Yes, yes.
- He' s letting Armstrong win.
- He can' t do that.
He won yesterday, you know.
We have to be careful not to accept Lance' s terms.
If we' re going to beat Lance, it has to be on our own terms.
If he can imprint in Ivan' s mind how he should ride -
- we won' t beat him.
He' s had it a little too easy.
Fifteen and a half kilometers long.
This is how it looks.
I don' t think about anything.
I ride as I' ve been doing the past 5 days.
It' s total chaos.
People running in front of the riders, hitting cars.
There are no barricades.
He promised to divide it up in two kilometers.
Go, Carlos!
Shout to the motorcycle.
You' il catch him in ten minutes.
Motorcycle!
I was afraid someone would step out in front of me.
What a bunch of idiots!
This is unbelievable!
Motorcycle!
Armstrong' s right there.
Ride through, Ivan, ride!
Armstrong' s on his way, Ivan.
Remember your breathing.
Go, Ivan.
It' s not over yet!
It' s not over yet.
I feel like jumping onto Ivan' s bike and pedaling like hell.
Give him a push.
Do whatever I can.
At the same time, I' m really impressed.
It looks really great when he comes whizzing by.
Anything can happen.
It takes so little to change the whole situation.
I don' t think he expected to catch Ivan.
He' d expected Ivan to give him a run for his money.
So did l.
And that' s what Ivan does, when he' s giving it all he' s got.
I think he was a little surprised to see us so soon.
Maybe he was relieved to see Ivan go down -
- because he knew he was dangerous.
Ivan was the one he had to watch out for.
Come on, Ivan.
Stay there!
Stay behind him!
Don' t be afraid!
Ride, now.
- until the night before.
It doesn' t matter, Ivan.
It' s all right.
I don' t feel well.
Things can only get better.
Do you know what times Jens, Peter and Bobby had?
In relation to Basso, so we can compare.
What was Carlos' time?
We were lacking what was there the other days.
It wasn' t a great day.
No.
I expected to ride better.
But I wasn' t that bad.
It didn' t go too well.
Hi.
Come over here.
Listen:
Daddy' s leg hurts.
Can' t you stroke my leg?
No, mine.
Can you stroke Daddy' s leg?
It hurts a lot.
Show what Daddy does when he wins.
If it' s ever going to happen... it' il take years.
I' m in good physical shape.
I can feel the motor, but the rest...
Don' t think about it now.
I feel bad.
Not so much for myself, but for the rest of you.
For myself...
Michele...
I know you haven' t achieved what you set out to do.
Life' s not over when your career' s over.
That' s when life begins.
"What should I do after my career' s finished?"
I' d like you all to think it over a bit.
It' s not enough that I' m the only one who knows this philosophy.
When you' re with some people more than those you really care about...... it' s a huge privation.
It' s not reasonable, somehow.
How long can you take it?
You can only take it so long as what you' re doing is fun...... and it draws a response.
Something has to make it worth it.
Otherwise it' s completely impossible.
You start thinking negatively.
It puts you somewhere else then where you should be.
Alessandra has given me invaluable support.
I' ve always felt she' s been very close to me throughout my career.
She' s never let me down.
Not even for a week.
She has always given me moral support.
She didn' t pay as much attention to me when my daughter was born.
Of course.
There' s never been a victory that has made me as happy -
- as when my daughter was born.
There' s no comparison.
- bring out many feelings in me.
But it can' t be compared with my family at all.
I haven' t spoken much with you yet.
But I want you to know the team means a lot to me.
Of course it' s not the same for you.
Because it' s your team.
So it means a lot to me.
But once in a while you have to...
- Don' t talk so much.
- I don' t know you so well.
You have a strong character.
It' s not so easy to sit and talk about.
You can tell me everything.
With no exceptions.
I know you' d like to go home.
You just have to say it.
- You can trust me.
- I trust you.
In a different way.
Some thought it was beautiful.
Others have criticized it.
I' ve always tried to do something different.
Win in a different way.
Maybe I' ve also lost some races in this way.
At the moment I prefer -
- how things could have been.
It' s all right to live and take one day at a time.
But of course the good thoughts blend in with the bad.
The good moments are what' s left.
The victories...... togetherness...
I was hoping for a good result.
Of course.
But there' il be other races.
- Don' t say that.
- But, still...
It' il be all right.
During the race I didn' t feel anything.
I lacked that extra something.
Getting results.
You shouldn' t think so much about it.
- Bye, we' il talk later.
The fate of the team depends a lot on me.
Of course it does.
So you think:
Is it dangerous that they' re extras in my little show?
That' s also something to think about.
I going to get drunk tonight.
My wallet...
There are many things I have learn to do better.
I have to be better at giving compliments.
I want to have more energy to do.
This is something you have to train yourself to do.
Train yourself to be a better man and a better father.
But you need the time and have to make priorities.
I don' t think I' ve been good enough at this.
But... it' s something I have to work on.
What we have now can' t be taken from us.
We should just be proud.
What does Daddy do when he wins?
- That asshole!
- Was it nice?
Yes.
One day it' il be me standing on that top step.
It was good...... but in our own way, right?
No... 65.
- It' s 64.
And you?
- 62.
You liar.
How tall are you then?
I' m the tallest.
- How tall?
I' m 179 centimeters.
- I don' t believe it.
- That' s right.
- Come here.
How tall are you?
Without shoes.
It' s right.
Come here and look.
Look...
Look.
That can' t be you.
It must be your brother.
- We got to get back.
- See ya, Matt.
Come through here.
Strip down.
Open up.
Welcome to Alcatraz.
(BeII rings) (Guard) Inside B and C!
- 25 on inside C, first tier.
- 20 inside B, first tier.
- 23 on inside C, second tier.
- 17 inside B, second tier.
Inside B and C.
Move!
Better button your coIlar, boy.
No forks.
Hey, no forks.
Do you see any?
Fresh fish, you want your pasta?
Hey, you want your pasta?
Do you see any?
I see pasta in my sleep.
I' m Litmus.
Like Iitmus paper.
When it' s cold, my face gets blue.
When it' s hot, my face gets red.
Inside C, move out.
Warden wants to see you.
Name?
Morris.
That' s funny.
This file says Frank Lee Morris.
If you disobey the rules of society, they send you to prison.
If you disobey the rules of prison, they send you to us.
Alcatraz is not Iike any other prison in the United States.
Here, every inmate is confined alone to an individuaI ceIl.
Unlike my predecessors, wardens Johnson and BlackweIl,
I don' t have good conduct programs.
I do not have inmate councils.
Inmates have no say in what they do.
They do as they' re told.
You are not permitted to have newspapers or magazines carrying news.
Knowledge of the outside world is what we teII you.
From this day on, your world wiII be everything that happens in this building.
You wiII shave once a day.
You wiII shower twice a week.
You wiII cut your hair once a month.
Now, your privileges.
You can talk.
You can work.
Other institutions hand out work, but here it' s a privilege that you earn.
I promise you it' s a privilege that you' II want.
Visitors - you' re aIlowed two a month.
They cannot be former inmates of this or any other federaI prison.
AII names that you submit wiII be carefuIly checked by the FBl.
What names do you have in mind?
I can' t think of any offhand.
Family members?
None.
No family.
Alcatraz is a maximum security prison with very few privileges.
We don' t make good citizens, but we make good prisoners.
Burglary, armed robbery, grand Iarceny...
You' ve escaped from quite a few prisons, haven' t you?
That' s why you' re here.
Alcatraz was built to keep aII the rotten eggs in one basket, and I was speciaIly chosen to ensure that the stink from the basket does not escape.
Since I' ve been warden some have tried to escape.
Most have been recaptured.
Those who haven' t have been kiIled or drowned in the bay.
No one has ever escaped from Alcatraz.
And no one ever wiIl.
You two go everywhere together?
Sure.
Even to bed together.
And when I wash, he washes.
That way we sleep nice- nice together.
Capisce?
I' m Wolf.
Where did they transfer you from?
Atlanta.
Nice town, Atlanta.
I never saw it.
I' m Iooking for a... new punk.
Good Iuck.
You don' t understand.
I just found her.
Why don' t you show her what you can do?
(Guard) Morris, I need somebody in the Iibrary.
- Take him over there, wiII you?
- Yes, Captain.
What you want, boy?
The buII sent me down here to work.
Can you read... boy?
As Iong as it' s in the English Ianguage, boy.
You treat them aII Iike Wolf?
Wolf wanted to get friendly.
I didn' t.
You' II take that cart to the ceIls.
Don' t they Iet cons down here?
You see any chairs?
How come?
Because this is The Rock, man.
They don' t want you doing anything here... but time... hard friggin 'time.
Rock affects dudes differently.
It either brings out your strength, or it breaks you.
What did it do for you?
What happens when you get out?
I won' t.
10 years ago...
I was in this bar in Alabama when two dudes started hassling me.
That was their first mistake.
They puIled knives.
That was their second mistake.
They didn' t know how to use them.
That was the Iast mistake they ever made.
I got two 99- year sentences back- to- back.
Seems Iike you could have pleaded self- defence.
The dudes were white, man, just Iike you.
When I arrived they put me in one of those dark ceIls in D- block.
After a while, I went stir crazy.
Sliced my AchiIles' tendon to get out.
You' II see why when you see D- block.
TeII me something, you through kiIling white guys?
- Why?
I just figured I wouldn' t turn my back on you.
Hey.
What' s your name, man?
Frank.
What' s yours?
English.
See you Iater.
- Your name?
- Morris.
OK.
- Magazine or book?
- Where' s English?
What did they do, give a nigger a nigger of his own?
Magazine?
- Hi.
- I' m Bugsy.
- Magazine?
Thanks.
- Hey, you' re new.
Hey, wait, wait a minute.
I haven' t seen a new guy in six months.
It' s nice to talk.
How are the Brooklyn Dodgers doing?
- Moved to LA two years ago.
- No kidding?
Warden don' t aIlow no books in these ceIls.
How come?
Because there' s no Iight in them.
Better deliver them books, Morris, where they can be read.
Right.
What' s the flower?
That' s something inside me they can' t Iock up with their bars and waIls.
I' m Doc.
You ever paint?
- No.
- Why not?
You scared of dying?
I don' t think so.
You better be.
You hurt Wolf.
Wolf' s going to hurt you.
Where you going, cracker?
Pete.
Something speciaI about those steps?
The higher you sit, the more status you got.
So we play king of the mountain, except here we don' t play for fun, man.
And you' re king?
Yeah.
Now, I figure there' s two reasons why you didn' t sit down on my step.
Either you' re too scared, or you just hate niggers.
Now, which is it, boy?
You too scared?
I just hate niggers.
So no one' s ever busted out.
No one' s ever made it.
Everyone has Iooked for a way, but there ain' t any.
See those hacks?
Most joints have one hack for every seven cons.
There' s one hack for every three cons here.
You start shitting at night instead of in the morning, they ask why.
Let' s say you' re going to try it anyway.
First, you' ve got to get out of the ceIl.
Each bar has six hard smaIler bars set in a steeI tube with extra steeI poured in.
And there ain' t no way to tunneI out, either.
Shit.
This island is solid rock.
See that water?
It' s over a mile swim to Iand.
The currents make it seem Iike 10.
And the water' s so cold it wiII numb your arms in minutes.
Even if you are a good swimmer, you won' t have time to make it.
There are 12 counts every day.
Sometimes I think that' s aII this shit hole is, one Iong count.
We count the hours, the buIls count us, and the king buIls count the counts.
(Whistle blows) (Guard) Inside!
Everybody in!
I' m assigning you a permanent job... the carpentry shop.
It' s a paying job.
- How much?
- 15 cents an hour.
WeIl, I always knew crime would pay.
It' s a job.
See you Iater.
I sleep Iousy, but I sniff the glue.
It helps pass the nights.
Aren' t you afraid they' II shake down your ceIl?
Then I go to the hole.
It' s worth the chance.
I guess anything you want bad enough is worth the chance.
Including busting out?
Hey, maybe there' s a way out.
It' s on top of your head.
The ventilator shafts on top of our block.
How do you get on top of the block?
- Ask the buII for the key.
- Thanks.
Hey, jive dude, where you going?
Summer' s coming on.
It' s getting cooler.
Weather here is as crazy as The Rock.
Maybe crazier.
Mark Twain wrote that the coldest winter he ever spent was summer in San Francisco.
I can...
Wolf' s coming at you.
- Is his hand cupped?
- Yes.
- Which one?
- His right.
Break off!
Drop it, Wolf!
(Guard) Drop it, Wolf.
You Iike D- block, Wolf?
You better, because you' re gonna rot there for a Iong time.
D- block, Morris.
Look, he came at me.
I said D- block.
- When I get out, you' re dead.
- You' II be dead before you get out.
Warden don' t Iike inmates fighting.
Don' t Iike 'em stinking up their ceIls, either.
Lights out!
Go on back to your ceIl.
(Guard) Welcome to Alcatraz.
- Hey, is anybody over there?
- Yeah, me.
- Come out in front and say heIlo.
- I' m busy.
(Toilet flushes)
I washed it.
How you doing, neighbour?
I' m Charley Butts.
SmaIlest ceII I ever seen.
- You' II get used to it.
- I don' t think so.
- I don' t Iike Iiving alone in here.
- You' II get used to that, too.
(BeII rings) (Guard) Break out!
Yard time!
Button the coIlar.
Who' s the new fish?
I got him next to me.
- What' s your name?
- Charley Butts.
Charley' s butt?
Butts.
Butts!
Charley Butts.
You got a funny name, kid.
- Yeah?
What' s your name?
- AI Capone.
- Aren' t you dead?
I got too much money.
I' II never die.
- You play poker?
- Not much.
I just Iearned myself.
We' II play tomorrow.
See you Iater, kid.
See you Iater, Al.
I don' t believe I just met AI Capone.
I don' t, either.
- I' m Doc.
- Charley Butts.
How' s the painting going, Doc?
The one of the warden?
It' s nearly finished.
- You painting the warden?
- He' s very inspiring.
Inside.
Everybody in!
Yes, sir?
I want painting privileges taken away from Chester Dalton.
- Doc?
- CeII 233.
What' s the reason?
You' re deputy warden.
You think of one.
When do you want the suspension to begin?
It' s not a suspension.
It' s an elimination.
Right away.
Yes, sir.
Painting privileges have been removed.
Why?
I don' t know.
Painting' s aII I have.
I' m sorry, Doc.
You OK, Doc?
I think there' s something wrong with him.
I' d keep my eye on Doc.
He seems pretty upset.
Cons are always upset about something.
Put your overaIls on.
Mr Zimmerman, I' m making a new table.
I need a hatchet.
Bob, get Doc a hatchet.
Mr Zimmerman!
Can you come over here for a minute?
Get him out of here!
Get him out!
Take him out of here!
Get him out!
Get back to work.
Let' s go!
Move!
Everybody, back to work!
Let' s go!
Here.
Put that in your report.
What were you doing back there, boy?
How about a magazine?
Why not?
What do you want?
I got Boys Life.
I know some queens who fight over it every month.
Just give me what you got on top there.
I heard about Doc... and I know why he did it.
Somebody took away his painting privileges.
Who?
The warden.
(Warden) Morris.
I hear there was an accident in the shop.
Accident?
Oh, you mean Doc.
Someone didn' t Iike what he was painting, so someone won' t Iet him paint.
Someone should have warned Doc to be carefuI what he paints.
I think you' re absolutely right, sir.
- Isn' t there?
- We have to be careful.
Back in Iine.
Hey, how' s it going, Frank?
If it isn' t the Anglins.
What are you guys doing, just dropping by?
Thought we' d pay you a visit.
Gonna stay Iong?
Not Iong.
Only about 15 or 20 years.
Why The Rock?
We were Ieaving Atlanta when we encountered a minor problem.
- Such as?
- They saw us.
Yeah, that do present a problem.
They shipped us to Leavenworth.
But we didn' t Iike their accommodations, either.
Warden said he knew just the place for us... Alcatraz.
- Is it true no one' s ever escaped?
- So they teII me.
Jesus.
Wonder what I' d be Iike after 15 years here.
You stiII reading that Bible?
It' s opening up aII kinds of new doors.
I turned 35 today.
Some birthday.
When' s your birthday?
I don' t know.
Jeez, what kind of childhood did you have?
Short.
Never thought it' d be Iike this.
What' d you get sent to The Rock for?
Couple of years ago I started stealing cars, for kicks mostly.
I' d seII the parts.
Got sent to the state pen.
You end up in Alcatraz for that?
Not exactly.
A buII there Iiked to push me around.
So when I got out, I went back, and stole his car.
Unfortunately, I drove it across the state Iine, which made it a federaI rap, and I was sent to The Rock.
(Guard) English!
Visitor for you.
Butts, you got a visitor.
- Me?
- Yeah, you.
Probably somebody wants their car back.
HeIlo, Father.
- Why didn' t you say you were coming?
- I was afraid you wouldn' t Iet me.
It' s just hard to see you Iike this.
Your mama' s going to die.
Charley?
When?
WeIl, she' s got a few months.
'Can you caII her?'
We' re not aIlowed to make phone caIls.
You cannot discuss Institution rules.
Stick to your personaI Iife.
This is my personaI Iife!
You getting a kick out of it?
- (Click) - HeIlo?
HeIlo!
I love you, Charley.
Hey, Frank.
Yeah?
If you try to get out, I want in.
Must be Wednesday.
Why?
Mystery mounds.
We always have mystery mounds on Wednesday.
I can' t taste it.
I just eat it out of habit.
What' s the movie this weekend?
Oh, some cowboy piece of shit.
(Imitating gangster) Hey, at Ieast they could show us a gangsta movie.
I may have found a way out of here.
You Iooking at something?
The way I figure it, this ceII block' s reaIly getting old.
The moist air corrodes the concrete.
The salt is rusting the metal.
I took a naiI clipper and dug around the griIle at the back of the ceIl.
I can dig that griIle out, and enlarge the hole into the utility corridor to the top of the ceII block and onto the roof.
How wiII we hide the hole?
We tear the ads from magazines... no one wiII miss those... make cardboard, paint griIles on that, and put it in the hole, maybe partiaIly obscure it with a toweI or whatever.
I' ve ordered an accordion to put in front of my hole.
Cambodia.
Another world, a secret world.
But the war in neighboring Vietnam burst its borders...... and the fighting soon spread to neutral Cambodia.
In 1973, I went to cover this sideshow struggle...... as foreign correspondent of The New York Times.
It was there, amidst the fighting...... between government troops and the Khmer Rouge guerrillas...... that I met my guide and interpreter, Dith Pran...... a man who was to change my life...... in a country that I grew to love and pity.
So here we go with Voice of America...... news for Southeast Asia.
It' s 6: 45 and a partly cloudy morning here.
Clouds too in Washington.
President Nixon announced he' il address the nation on Watergate...... within the next few days.
The speech will be Nixon' s first since May.
The scandal has caused resignations and paralyzed the White House staff.
It has also led to intense confrontation and perhaps...... a constitutional crisis with Senate investigators...... and a special Watergate prosecutor.
The speech was announced after the Gallup Poll disclosed...... that Mr. Nixon' s popularity had fallen to the lowest point...... for an American President in 20 years.
A Supreme Court judge, William O. Douglas...... has ruled against an appeal by the Administration...... for a stay of the injunction...... on further U. S. Bombing missions in Cambodia.
Congress has already ruled these bombings illegal...... and they should cease in one week' s time on August the 15th.
To the hospital!
Mister, you want taxi?
Mister, you want taxi?
Shut the fucking blinds, will you?
What' s all this shit?
I thought you were the houseboy.
I was developing some film.
Don' t want to yell.
I had to take a taxi here.
I got you.
What the fuck is that on your head?
It' s a sanitary napkin.
I had it soaked in ice.
Syd Schanberg.
Is Pran there?
No, I just came from the airport.
I' il be at the Café Central, tell him.
Want some eggs?
Somebody told me they faint with fright when you cook them.
- What are you having?
I' m having a café complet.
I' il have that.
And some aspirin.
Anything I eat has got to be absolutely dead.
That' s why I can never eat an oyster.
I read somewhere that they put...... that lemon juice on them just to stun them.
Look at this.
A rocket?
I saw a guy on a motorbike.
I left a message for you.
I didn' t get it.
- There is a big accident right now.
I think U. S. Drop many big bombs on little city.
You' re sure?
- Nothing at all.
We' re going.
Not possible right now, Sydney.
Too dangerous.
Where you going, Schanberg?
Neak Luong.
Don' t give me that, Reeves.
You got nothing to say about this.
I got a right to go wherever I like in this sad little country.
That' s the law.
You impede me, you' re breaking the Cooper/ Church Amendment!
Well, up the Cooper/ Church Amendment' s ass!
So how can I help you, Mr. Schanberg?
I' m looking for information on why my airplane was delayed this morning.
- That' s right.
Your flight' s...
No, I don' t.
Then I' d like you to listen to something...... and then I' d like a comment.
This morning, for reasons beyond anybody' s control...... I spend two hours in Bangkok staring at a seat belt sign.
Meanwhile, my sources tell me...... two Army helicopters are landing here, just across the airfield.
Half the ambulances in Phnom Penh are waiting there to meet them.
And now there' s a rumor that the U. S. Air Force dropped a bomb...... or several bombs, on Neak Luong.
That' s a rumor, and I' m not gonna comment on a rumor.
I just want to know if that' s the reason why my airplane was delayed!
No comment.
How many killed?
How many wounded?
Thank you for your cooperation, Major Reeves.
When I scrape this story out, I will no doubt be quoting you in full!
I' m sorry.
This is just not good enough.
This is a big story...... a major story, you understand that?
I want to get down that river!
I' il be here.
Good night, Sydney.
No, sir.
Bob?
Hello, Sydney.
Good night, Sydney.
- You can talk to me.
Let' s not start insulting each other.
All right, good night.
You' ve heard of pilot error?
Computer malfunction?
They screwed up on the coordinates.
A single B- 52 dropped its entire load on Neak Luong.
There' s a homing beacon in the middle of the town.
- You' il be briefed tomorrow.
We estimate 55 military, something like 35 civilians.
How many?
I hear it' s in the hundreds.
Will there be a dreadful bloodbath
We haven' t had this for four weeks.
New York Times probably had it flown in.
- We got a cellar.
Americans take themselves so seriously.
He' s just trying to get to the top of the heap.
We' il just have to pay more to get our telexes to the top of the heap.
Now drink up.
- Enjoy it.
- Off to see the telex operator?
- Sure!
- All right?
- Very possible.
Let' s go then!
This is good work.
- Hundred fifty.
Nice going, Pran.
- He wants you to look at his family.
To take a photograph and help him because his child was wounded.
Tell me what she' s saying.
She needs help.
Her shop was destroyed last night.
Her husband killed.
How many bombs?
She doesn' t know.
Does she know where the hospital is?
"Just over there."
She wants to know, "Did someone arrest the pilot?"
Mister, you wanna buy?
You wanna buy?
- I' m out of film.
Ask her how many kids she' s got in her family.
"Five."
Her husband was killed already.
What are these guys over here?
In the jeep, prisoners.
Khmer Rouge prisoners.
They kill a lot of villagers.
She says Khmer Rouge soak rags in gasoline...... and push them down villagers' throat...... then set the rags alight.
Film!
I know there' s no film.
No camera!
Tell them we' re jour...
Come on!
Get in!
I' m worried.
I' m the guy who bring you over here.
They accuse me and they arrest me.
You' re already arrested.
They phone Phnom Penh about me.
I want some cigarettes.
And I need to take a leak.
Would you tell them I need to piss?
He said, "No piss."
That' s no piss.
I' ve had enough of this bullshit.
I got a story to get to New York!
Don' t leave me!
I won' t leave you.
They want to sanitize the story!
Bastards!
I am going to tell you something.
Blow my head off?
You got a general out there, this is an American passport...... and I am walking out of here!
- He wants to get higher officer.
Get him!
It' s still a restricted area.
Now, if you look across the river...... you' il see positions held by Khmer Rouge...... who moved in over the past few days.
They' il have the K. R. Out before you can say "Jack Robinson."
Get in the chopper now!
No, Schanberg!
You came on a boat, you go back on a boat!
What is this?
If you weren' t down here, I wouldn' t be down here.
And I don' t want to be down here!
If anybody ever reads about this...... you won' t be able to look them in the face!
What time is it?
Shit.
Telex for you.
You been to the telex?
Sure.
We must be doing something right.
My wife is very worried.
She thinks all foreign journalists are going to leave Cambodia.
Well, Pran...... l' d feel kind of stupid trying to cover this war from a desk in Bangkok.
And she said if the war keeps going like this...... the future could be very bad.
What do you think?
I don' t know.
I don' t know either.
- Sure.
Let' s get going.
I won' t.
If they cut it, the city could be lost.
"You' il be all right with us," we say.
Now look at all this fucking mess!
In America, everybody got a good car.
He ask you what car you drive in United States.
I don' t have a car in America, only the Mercedes here.
Mercedes, number one!
Ask him where he learned to speak his English.
American advisor with his unit teach him.
Mercedes, number one, okay?
He said he thought all American people left already.
Made in the USA.
Are we winning?
No, you' re not winning.
Well, you make sure they don' t cut off the airport road.
The first section came by Route number 36.
And the second one came down by Route number 26.
Khmer Rouge will come down Route 3.
They expect an attack today.
- Phnom Penh.
- Why there?
Get out here!
Come on, let' s get him out of here!
Jon, I' m leaving.
Syd, come on!
Khmer Rouge!
In Washington, the Cambodian ambassador...... in a speech to the Washington Press Club said:
"Let' s face it, you took advantage of us."
"You are cleverer than we are, and you induced us into this fighting."
Indeed, the Khmer Rouge insurgents in Cambodia...... have tightened their ring around the capital, Phnom Penh...... now swollen with some two million refugees from the fighting.
Reports from government troops talk of the field situation being so bad...... that soldiers are having to siphon gas from jeep to jeep...... in order to be able to get the wounded back to the capital.
No more electricity.
And now I get a message to try for negotiations.
Well, it' s just too goddamn late!
We put this ship to sea, and it breaks my heart not to help it back to port.
What pisses me off is, this country has faults and strengths...... and we have done nothing but play to the faults.
I tell you, I will be damn glad to get out of here.
This thing has dragged on too long for it to end in all sweetness and light.
After what the Khmer Rouge have been through...... they won' t be exactly affectionate toward Westerners.
- Where do you want this?
Anywhere.
- Mr. Schanberg...
- Oh, Christ, my dependents!
Dith Pran and family.
"Dear sir, my family and I are planning a touring vacation of Southeast Asia...... and anticipate two weeks in Cambodia touring the country.
Would you please send tour information and brochures?
Thanking you in advance, Wendell Payne. "
Wendell lives in Wisacky, South Carolina.
What about the airlift?
We' re taking it with us.
- People will starve to death.
Look, there could be a bloodbath here.
Excuse the pun, but we' re either staying or we' re living.
Hello, leaving a sinking ship then, are we, Carver?
President Ford, in his foreign policy speech, hardly referred to Cambodia...... except to say that, as of now, it may be too late.
I' m late.
- They stop me because of the curfew.
I' m sorry.
Tell them to start sending this out...... but hold the last two paragraphs.
I' il have corrections in an hour.
They don' t transmit today.
The transmitter at Kambol got hit.
6 p. m.
A monthly magazine?
This is a newspaper.
How about update tomorrow?
We can file an update tomorrow.
I was over at the American Embassy yesterday.
Good news?
No, not good news.
They say that when this place goes up...
... they think a lot of people will be killed.
A lot of people.
I' ve arranged for the evacuation of you and your family.
What do you want to do?
Do you want to stay or leave?
And how about you?
That' s none of your business.
Do you want to stay, or do you want to leave?
I know.
You love my family.
But me, I' m reporter too.
You know what I mean?
All right, we don' t have to decide this right now.
Take it easy.
But we' il have to make up our minds pretty soon, right?
All right, this is it!
Is the floor clear?
This is the last check.
This is the last check!
Mr. Kincaid is not here.
Mr. Kincaid is gone.
Now, I want you to go right now!
You won' t see Mr. Kincaid again!
- And his wife?
- Yes, sir, they are.
- No, sir, they haven' t arrived yet.
Have you seen Pran?
Where is he?
Well, it' s been real.
They' re gonna miss it.
Why don' t you check around the other side?
If he comes here, I' m looking for him in the back.
Beth!
Have you seen Pran?
He' s at the post office!
Move your asses out of here!
- Where do you think you' re going?
- To embassy.
Yes, sir, what' s your name?
Dith Pran family, sir.
Dith Pran family?
- Sydney Schanberg.
- They' ve been through.
Run!
There' s no time!
Wait a minute.
Smile.
Who told you that?
The British Embassy.
Khmer Rouge coming.
Look like government soldiers give them big welcome.
No more fighting!
I be right back!
No more war!
What do you think?
I don' t like the look of this.
I was in Keng Kang this morning.
Practically got my ass shot off.
I just don' t think these guys are for real.
You want to come with me?
Jesus, what am I supposed to do?
Sing her a lullaby?
Jesus, another shrapnel in the spine here.
Okay, let' s have her over.
This is blood group A. We' ve had one unit of blood in the last two days.
The problem is, it' s all in the wrong fucking place.
Why do corpses have to pile up before people decide it' s time to go home?
- He' s trying to get in!
They won' t let him in.
All right?
Okay?
Looks all right.
He' s with The New York Times!
He' s a journalist and he' s with me!
Let me see him!
The picture in Cambodia is increasingly unclear.
Journalists who have flown from Thailand over Phnom Penh...... report that the Khmer Rouge have attempted...... a mass evacuation of the entire population.
Radio contact with the French Embassy reveals that some 200 Europeans...... and an undisclosed number of Cambodians have taken refuge.
As yet, no statement has been made by the new rulers of Cambodia.
He' s sleeping.
That' s the consul.
- Did you see that, Dennis?
- The Russians are coming.
Look, piss off!
You won' t get anything here!
BBC, Dougal.
- Daily reports of fighting around the airport...... 14 kilometers outside Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia.
And now, an on- the- spot report from our correspondent in Thailand...... Hugh Elder.
Where do they get this crap?
The little guy?
Could we not all look at once, please?
You' re kidding.
You know what I mean?
- How does he get his copy out?
With specially trained hens.
The BBC has, like, commissioned them to walk past the Khmer Rouge...... like their regular fowl.
They' ve been crossing the border into Thailand every day and every night.
Unconfirmed reports say the Khmer Rouge are demanding...... that any officials of the defeated Lon Nol government...... especially the so- called Six Traitors of the Cabinet...... be handed over to them.
It is not known whether any of the ex- ministers...... may have taken refuge in the embassy...... where, in the words of a UNlCEF representative in Bangkok...... the situation is said to be "increasingly precarious."
The only sense I can make of it is that there' s...... some sort of internal power struggle going on.
Different groups seem to be holding different parts of the city...... and they all appear to be equally nervous over losing power and control.
Half of them are under 15.
Can you help?
Use Pran.
The Kingdom Hospital rests on ancient marshland where the bleaching ponds once lay.
Here the bleachers moistened their great spans of cloth.
The steam evaporating from the wet cloth shrouded the place in permanent fog.
Centuries later the hospital was built here.
The bleachers gave way to doctors and researchers, the best brains in the nation and the most perfect technology.
To crown their work they called the hospital The Kingdom.
Now life was to be charted, and ignorance and superstition never to shake the bastions of science again.
Perhaps their arrogance became too pronounced, and their persistent denial of the spiritual.
For it is as if the cold and damp have returned.
Tiny signs of fatigue are appearing in the solid, modern edifice.
No living person knows it yet, but the gateway to The Kingdom is opening once again.
Thy Kingdom Come
My poor wee chap!
What' s happened?
Let me guess...
Oh my God!
Your Donald Duck magazine hasn' t arrived.
How the hell are you going to pass the time now?
Oh, I' il find some jobs to do.
No, no, no panicky solutions.
Where' s the boss?
No idea.
Of course not.
But the doctors car park is an earthquake zone.
It was a great experience.
We must find her again.
She needs me.
Urgently.
Where do you think you are going?
Mrs Drusse is in hospital.
ln the hospital, Mrs Drusse has a bed.
lt' s in bed I want to see Mrs Drusse, and nowhere else.
Consultant neurosurgeon Hook told me I could walk about a bit.
Wait...
Just who is consultant neurosurgeon Hook?
Him?...
You, a consultant neurosurgeon?
Mrs Drusse, you are seriously ill.
There' s never been a body fluid count like yours...
Sister!
Consultant neurosurgeon Hook says give this patient a saline drip in her own bed.
A slow one.
It is l.
Your diplomacy didn' t work.
Mona' s mother has complained.
A good thing you' re in the lodge.
Lots of the brethren are on the General Medical Council.
We' il discuss the complaint at morning conference.
It' s better than letting rumours fly.
Then it' il look as if I' ve found a few ways out but don' t want to burden the staff.
That' s a trick you could use.
They all think you' re a bit harsh.
But I think the complaint will be of benefit to you here.
It' il make you seem more human.
What makes you like Denmark, specially?
Dr. Helmer joined us two months ago, and we' re proud to have this internationally acclaimed neurosurgeon here.
Sadly, Dr. Helmer is already having to become acquainted with one of the less attractive areas of Danish medicine, namely patient complaints.
As some of you recall problems arose in connection with an operation he performed on Mona somethingorother just after he joined us.
A complaint has been lodged and I' d like to ask you all to give him your support.
ln this context I' d like to raise a minor problem to which I think it reasonable for the staff to propose solutions.
Uncertainty has been expressed visavis working with Dr. Helmer.
Stig may find it peculiar that we address such things together.
But if Operation Morning Breeze is to justify its existence we must also let the morning air into our personal spheres.
Perhaps you do things differently in Sweden...
Any suggestions as to how to counter this uncertainty visavis working with Dr. Helmer?
Communication.
Splendid.
Communication... does anyone else feel communication' s the problem?
He never says anything, and when he does it' s in Swedish.
We probably can' t solve the Swedish problem right away.
Let' s hear what Dr. Helmer has to say.
How do you feel we can improve communication with you?
How should I know?
Would it help to call you Stig?
Be more personal?
Excuse me, I have work to do.
Operations, and other trivial tasks.
Of course...
1, 2, 3, 4...
This plate is unclean.
The walls have been flaking.
Can' t you do something?
No, nothing.
Oh, dear.
We' il have to wash them again.
It' il wash off easily.
There are other things that can' t be washed off.
What do you mean?
Blood?
Some blood can be washed off and some blood cannot.
Tell me, are you crazy?
No girl will ever be interested in anyone so childish.
Poor Sanne!
Whatever were you thinking of?
But you' ve got the charm of a turd.
You' d better put that head back where it came from.
Good......
Not that it' s my affair.
And I never want to see you again.
Shove off.
I' il miss the operation.
Professor Bondo wants to see me.
Did you screw up?
Why?
Well, he' s summoned you, hasn' t he?
Run along, then.
I see you' ve asked to see me later, too.
Can I go, too?
lf you want to be a doctor, you' il have to watch an operation.
What if I watched through the window?
To kind of get used to it?
Why isn' t the patient asleep?
May.
The patient reacts to anaesthesia.
This gentleman is going to hypnotise the patient.
It' s so exciting!
The hell it is.
Einar!
Where are the funny noses?
What do you mean, Stig?
You are a circus manager and we clowns want noses.
Red ones, with elastic bands.
This clown appears in my theatre and says he has a job to do.
The hypnotist... of course you should have been informed.
The patient reacts to anaesthesia.
Rigmor can tell you more.
Scruples about operating because of the Mona complaint?
It' s like riding. lf you fall, you get straight back on.
Mona has got nothing to do with it.
I' m pleased to hear it.
But you must admit this is exciting.
Purely scientifically...
After all, it' s related to your article in The Lancet.
Though you' d know that better than I do, since you wrote it.
By the way, have a handful of the Morning Breeze stickers you recommended I had printed.
They' re super.
How are you?
Where did you get to?
I' ve had work to do.
I' m tired of lying here.
A spirit is calling.
I must search.
There' s nothing wrong with me.
You' ve changed your tune.
I can walk.
Sad about the drip.
Yes, if I didn' t have a porter in the family.
Relax, relax.
You are feeling drowsy.
ln a moment you won' t be able to feel anything.
At first in your skin, then your whole head on the count of three...
One... two... three.
Scalpel.
By the way, I dropped into the clothes store.
Pean.
It was very clear that you had borrowed a dressing gown.
Dressing gowns are for the patients...... not the staff.
Hand it back immediately.
ln Sweden you' d have been given very short shrift.
I thought the patient was asleep.
He should have been.
Whether my patient is under anaesthetic or not, whether he' s under hypnosis or he has just been knocked out with a blunt instrument is totally irrelevant.
But he must keep his mouth shut.
Relax, you feel marvellous.
All the pain has gone, everything is over.
Come in, Mogge.
I have good news and I have bad news.
The good news is that I have no proof.
The bad news is that if I get the slightest evidence
linking a certain stolen body part with your personage will result not only in your immediate expulsion but also to my calling the police.
I hope you have left no trace.
A pathologist is a blood hound by profession.
I have no more time for you.
Real life has summoned me.
Hello, my name is Dr. Bondo.
You are related to Mr. Zakariasen?
He' s my husband.
This is our son.
I am not the doctor who treated your husband, I' m a pathologist.
I requested this interview.
Are we to talk in front of him?
Mrs. Zakariasen, your husband cannot hear what we say.
What do you want to say?
New legislation requires that you consent to dissection.
What' s a dissection?
He wants to cut daddy up, Mum.
Without autopsies we' d still be in the Stone Age.
Or is that just a formality?
Dissection would only take place after death.
Would you mind telling us what your personal interests in this case are?
Am I right in thinking they go beyond those of general medicine?
Your father has a hepatoma.
I think my research has achieved important results, but for a decade I have had no specimen to work on.
I need your father' s liver to conclude my research.
So your beautiful thoughts on benefiting humanity are more to do with your own career.
We can' t really take your problem seriously.
I find your request rather distasteful.
My research may improve the treatment of hepatomas.
It might prevent others from suffering like this.
With one patient a decade
I doubt if society would pay for any new form of treatment.
Nobody can argue that dissection doesn' t make sense.
We' re not arguing.
We' re just saying no.
We' d like to be alone with dad now.
Right.
Will the junior registrar close him up?
Didn' t you hear me?
Please close him up.
Communication problems?
All right, put his lid on.
Actually, communications aren' t the problem.
The problem is qualifications, Hook.
You... you must always...... obey Professor Tribini.
Professor Tribini will count to three.
All of a sudden you are a good doctor.
Or what, Hook?
He has withdrawn my funds for a phase contrast microscope.
He says savings must be made.
Yet just look at the waste...
Listen carefully.
You can hear my voice.
ln a moment I' il count to three and you will wake up.
You will feel marvellous.
You' il feel marvellous.
You' il be yourself again.
One, two...
Now open your eyes slowly...
I' d like to talk to the doctor who did the operation.
There was a girl...
A girl?
A little girl.
She was kind.
I was upset, and she stroked my hand.
The doctor who' s just gone out?
Yes, that' s Judith.
The little girl pointed at her and said "family".
Family?
Hi, Bulder.
Hi, Drusse.
What are you up to?
Looking for the ghost.
Why not take Bongo?
He howls when he hears that ambulance.
Really?
I' m not taking a dog.
It' s bad enough pushing my mum mile after mile.
I' m sick of pushing this bed about.
I' ve been pushing it all day.
And dogs aren' t allowed here.
lf we push him round in this, nobody will ever know.
He' s picked up the scent.
Where are we now?
lnfectious medicine.
What now?
She' s here.
Hi, Mogge.
Did I miss a Swedish screwup?
What did you want?
You wanted guinea pigs for the sleep lab.
Are you sure you' d want to?
It' s heavy stuff.
OK by me.
You get 150 per sleep period.
We do an ECG to measure which brain centres are activated while you dream.
Then you describe the process.
OK by me.
Fine.
Report to the cage.
You said Helmer had taken away your microscope?
I can apply again next year.
That' s crazy.
I think so, too.
I' ve a better idea.
Where are we going?
I want to show you something.
Everything looks fine.
The hypnoanaesthesia was apparently highly effective.
You say you didn' t notice the operation, or any discomfort?
ln the operating theatre?
She tried to talk to the doctor doing the operation, but he wouldn' t listen.
She tried to talk to Helmer?
Yes... he wouldn' t listen.
And I think I know why.
Wouldn' t listen to what?
Her little bell.
Why not?
Because it was the death bell.
What bloody nonsense!
Don' t let it bother you.
I don' t.
I take no notice of any of the nonsense here.
Professor Bondo just phoned.
He wants to address the lodge.
I' m trying to scrape some brethren together for tonight.
"The death bell!"
Pull in here.
Hi, Bulder.
Any news?
You' ve been for quite a walk with Mrs. Drusse.
That drip ran out hours ago.
Bongo!
Come here!
Dogs aren' t allowed in hospitals!
This is where I live.
Oh, you don' t really.
Yes, I do.
It' s just practical.
Most of my friends work down here.
ln the passageways and kitchens round about.
I like living here, don' t get me wrong.
What if you get found out?
I have been.
We have a tacit agreement.
I fix things for the hospital and the hospital leaves me alone.
There' s a lot of wastage, and that' s not a good thing.
Helmer said you' d stolen a dressing gown.
ls it anything to do with that?
It' s an excellent example.
But he got it wrong.
It wasn' t just one dressing gown.
It was hundreds.
Dressing gowns were piling up at neurosurgery.
So I dealt with them.
How?
I redirect them.
Redirect them?
To wards where they' re needed.
What' s in it for you?
I don' t get anything out of it.
I just don' t like...
I' m happy when things aren' t wasted.
Ethyl alcohol and distilled water.
The cleanest drink you can get.
Per, this is Hook.
At K5006 there' s a whole pile of equipment.
Will you look for...
What was it you wanted?
A phase contrast microscope.
What' s that?
Hey, that' s spooky!
Maybe it is.
"We all have own private cemetery".
Each tray represents one of the senior doctors here.
And each cross is a death?
Not likely, or I' d be busy!
No, each cross represents a death or injury caused by medical negligence.
There' s just not that number of mistakes reported.
Reported, no, and I don' t tell the world about it either.
But one day I might find a use for my knowledge.
That was quick, lads.
A present from the Kingdom.
I begin to see how you got that tacit agreement...
It' il soon be dark.
Yes, evening is falling.
And when night comes, we shall sleep.
There' s something I don' t understand.
What don' t you understand?
lf the little girl from the lift is kind and good, why does the old woman want to chase her away?
The little girl is unhappy.
She cannot rest.
We sleep when night falls.
She never sleeps.
She needs help so she can rest.
I wondered if you' d come and sit with Mrs. Mogensen?
She' s such a sweet old lady, and she' s interested in spiritualism.
You haven' t heard...
She had another turn this morning.
The doctor expects her to pass away tonight.
I am sorry.
I had such a nice time with Mrs. Mogensen.
She asked for you earlier, but you weren' t in your room.
Now she keeps slipping in and out of consciousness.
But I think she' d appreciate your company.
Of course.
No, thanks.
I' il stick to my crossword, even if I can' t do it.
Just ring if you are afraid.
My dear girl, I shan' t be afraid.
I have sat with the dying before.
The jaw drops and that' s that.
It can be very peaceful.
ls that you, Mrs. Drusse?
Yes, it' s me, Emma.
Where did you get to?
I was ghost hunting.
And all your spirits.
I have been very fond of you, too.
Do they say I' m dying?
Yes.
Are you afraid?
A little.
Don' t be afraid, Emma.
You' re just passing over to all those zany spirits.
Quite true.
It is a spiritualist' s duty to die.
I' il be coming soon.
I' m an old biddy myself.
You aren' t old.
Stuff and nonsense.
But let' s not argue, eh, Emma?
I think I' il sleep a bit.
That' s right, Emma.
Come on!
Rigmor!
Your tenderness, your warmth.
I don' t deserve them.
You do, Stig.
I am a weakling.
But I can handle those thickheads.
Even their moronic Operation Morning Breeze.
But that Mona business is getting to me.
Because you are under pressure.
All men are under pressure.
But all you need is a woman to feed you well and give you some of the herbal remedies I' ve mentioned.
Nietzsche lived off them, or at least wrote about them.
You are fantastic.
You exploit my weaknesses.
You are forcing your witchcraft on me.
First came a book about Haiti.
Then a trip to Haiti I should treat you to.
Stop putting up so much resistance.
I want to look after you.
Yes.
Quietly does it!
Stig...
What' s on your mind?
I' d like an honest answer...
Did you really say I had a backside like a chest of drawers?
Who said that?
Never you mind.
Did you?
Of course not.
Eh?
Hi, Pop.
He' s a good boy.
I told you to stay away.
The toothbrush isn' t for you.
I' ve come to sleep.
Don' t be silly.
Look at your papers.
But you' il have to sleep.
I' m not allowed to talk to the guinea pigs.
I' ve come to sleep, not talk.
Fine.
Change in there.
Dear brethren,
I have never previously exercised my right to convene you.
So you will understand the gravity of my problem.
You know I set great store by my research, despite the friendly teasing about my lack of hepatomas.
And that' s the point.
After a ten year wait, a wonderful hepatoma has popped up.
The tumor will allow me to conclude my research but I can' t have it!
The patient, who is on Professor Ulrich' s ward, is dying.
But the family refuses to allow dissection.
There' s nothing I can do.
So near, and yet so far!
I have a freeze dried sample, but I need the whole tumor.
To the very last I hoped that an operation would be performed thus placing the tumour in my hands.
I know it was wishful thinking, Professor, for the tumor is inoperable.
But nevertheless...
I no longer delude myself that a solution will appear from nowhere.
So I have convened you to ask for help.
Help me to help medical science!
Haven' t you finished yet?
I can' t sleep.
Don' t worry, you will.
Turn over.
Ghost hunting...
Of course you' ve been ghost hunting!
Did you speak, Emma?
Tell me about it...
What shall I tell you?
We searched everywhere.
But she didn' t reveal her presence everywhere.
To announce her presence she rings a little bell.
Where?
Where?
Everywhere.
Do you think it might be of some significance?
It was at Gynaecology.
Ward Y.
And then at Respiratory diseases...
Medicine.
You mustn' t go, Mrs. Drusse.
I am right beside you, Emma.
I think it will be soon.
ls there anything you want me to do, Mrs. Drusse on the other side?
Find my ghost, talk to her.
Ask her why she is so unhappy and what I can do about it.
What' s her name?
I don' t know, but I expect you' il find her anyway.
Ghosts are in the state in between.
ln Swedenborg Space.
But you won' t stay there long, you will want to cross it into the light.
But try and stay there a couple of minutes.
They will call you from the light, and tug at you.
But try to delay your crossing and answer me, Emma.
I' il do my best.
Thank you, Emma, you' re very kind.
I' m not meant to tell you how the Mona affair is progressing, but I got a furious letter from the Chief Medical Officer today.
Apparently the anaesthesia report was destroyed.
The CMO wants to see the anaesthetist' s notes.
Blood pressure, and so on.
That' s the bad thing about being a manager.
What is the bad thing about being a manager?
Management, damn it!
Bondo is in a most unfortunate situation.
It would look good if you could help...
Me?
The lodge likes active brethren.
Specially just after initiation.
Poor Bondo.
Yes, poor chap.
I' m no psychiatrist, but anyone can see he is madly insane.
His speech is incoherent, he dribbles, yes, he' s bonkers.
You mustn' t say that, Stig, you' re a scientist yourself.
Moreover, a brother' s cry for help will always be heard however insignificant the matter may appear to be.
Give Bondo' s problem some thought.
You' re so creative, you nervous types.
The more you stand by Bondo, the more the lodge will stand by you.
This is where we part.
You can find the lift again?
Don' t let the Mona affair dent your good humour.
Creative!
Emma...
Keep listening, and I' il talk you through.
Let go, Emma, but don' t fall too far.
Stay in the state in between!
Stay in the state in between.
Don' t leave Swedenborg Space!
Answer me...
We must hurry.
Two, don' t know.
Three, yes.
Are they tugging at you from inside the light, Emma?
ls it beautiful in the light?
We' re wasting our time.
Have you found her?
No?
You need a name?
Really, Emma?
Ward Y...
And A...
MARY.
Mary.
Her name is Mary, Emma.
ls her name Mary?
Fine! ls she with you?
What shall I ask about, then?
Where can I find out?
ls there anywhere?
But where, Emma?
ln this hospital?
Hold on, Emma, hold on!
Everything in this hospital has a number.
Give me a number before you disappear...
First digit 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Third digit, 1, 2... 532...
Thank you, Emma.
That was kind of you.
Good evening.
Can you tell me about Mary?
No, I don' t know anyone called Mary.
Whose is the other bed?
Mrs. Krüger' s.
She' s in the pool.
They couldn' t stand the way she went on pleading and pleading so they opened the pool, even though it was late.
But you won' t get much out of talking to her.
She' s completely gaga.
Old and gaga...
Goodnight.
Who is Mary?
My name' s Ellen.
Daddy gave me a new dolly today.
How old are you, Ellen?
Nine.
Do you know Mary?
She' s in daddy' s hospital.
Her chest is poorly.
She has a hump.
Mary has a hump.
What year is this?
1919, of course.
lsn' t Dolly' s hair lovely?
It says "Mary" here.
He' s a doctor.
The picture is under the pillow in the pram.
ls that you next to your father?
No, that' s Mary.
They wrote a song about her.
Shall I sing it?
May I borrow your picture?
ln a ward in hospital
ln a white bed there
Lay a little girl who coughed
Sick and pale, with golden hair.
Lay a little girl who coughed
Sick and pale, with golden hair.
Every heart she stole away
As she lay there sweet and good
Bore her pain without complaint
With childish fortitude.
Bore her pain without complaint
With childish fortitude
Stig?
Hi.
Where is the lift?
Or the stairs?
Say hello to my friend.
He spent his childhood in Haiti.
He can tell you all about zombies.
He tends the animals.
lf I have to choose between zombies and the stairs,
I' il take the stairs.
I had a nasty dream.
The questionnaire...
I haven' t time.
No money, then.
Any activity?
No, it' s been very quiet.
Kingdom security here....
Just a minute.
It' s that call again!
Record it, damn it!
This is stretcher van 12.
We' re heading down Lyngby Road towards the Kingdom.
With horn and flashing lights...
Stretcher vans?
That was 100 years ago.
Call the police.
Those calls come every night.
Bulder!
"A Helping Hand from Copenhagen".
"Last week Professor Aage Krüger returned to his home town to tell 6 year old Mary Jensen she could be treated free of charge at the Kingdom.
Mary is looking forward to visiting the capital.
Here she thanks the Professor... "
There' s a photo of her.
Thanks for the microscope.
I' m not busy tonight.
I thought you would be, now you' ve got it.
What about that research?
I know I' ve been playing hard to get, and I do like you.
But I was in love with somebody else.
And... now you' re not?
I don' t know.
He left a few months ago, I don' t think he' il be back.
It' s not a problem for me.
Did you really think it would be?
It' s not that simple.
I' m pregnant.
ls that good or bad?
Good.
I want a baby.
But I thought it might complicate things for you.
Listen, Sweetie.
Pregnant or not.
lf you have the baby, I' il love it, too.
You thought I wouldn' t if it wasn' t mine?
Maybe I did.
What an idiot!
Who?
The bloke who ran off and left such a lovely girl.
Aage...
Aage.
What an arsehole!
What' s the matter?
I went all dizzy.
Of course, you' re pregnant.
And I' d already forgotten.
Lie down.
We must take your temperature.
Because I' m pregnant?
Some doctor!
Be quiet, we can' t be careful enough.
And it might go up a degree or two...
"Our forests are fresh and big, Cuckoo, cuckoo, faldera."
Hans Christian Andersen, Danish national poet.
They' re not just idiots.
They' re deadly dangerous.
Danish scum.
lf Mary' s who we' re looking for, where' s her little lamb?
It' s the dog.
Well, that was Part 2 of The Kingdom.
I' d like to thank you again for watching our little series.
Mrs. Drusse continues to slavishly follow all the clues knowing they may lead her into trouble.
I am very happy with Part 2 and I' d call it poetic and captivating.
Maybe you think the story is predictable and depressing.
ls it monotonous and humdrum?
Then enjoy the comfort of the familiar.
But if your life is exciting, enjoy this break from the caviar with its view of the trivia you have surely out behind you.
My name is Lars von Trier and I wish you a very good evening.
Should you wish to revisit the Kingdom be prepared to take the Good with the Evil!
The Kingdom Hospital rests on ancient marshland where the bleaching ponds once lay.
Here the bleachers moistened their great spans of cloth.
The steam from the cloth shrouded the place in permanent fog.
Then the hospital was built here.
The bleachers gave way to doctors, researchers, the best brains in the nation and the most perfect technology.
To crown their work they called the hospital The Kingdom.
Now life was to be charted, and ignorance and superstition never to shake science again.
Perhaps their arrogance became too pronounced,
like their persistent denial of the spiritual.
For it is as if the cold and damp have returned.
Tiny signs of fatigue are appearing in the solid, modern edifice.
No living person knows it yet, but the portal to the Kingdom is opening once again.
Thank you, Sweden.
Are you Stig G. Helmer?
Will you sign here?
My Volvo!
How happy you make me!
How much is it?
I think we should let the courts decide.
You have now identified yourself as Stig G. Helmer and accepted the writ.
The first hearing will be in a fortnight.
Spirits, spirits!
I don' t think this is a good idea.
Spirits, spirits...
Oh, there you are!
I have a little surprise for you.
You do look nice, Rigmor.
Yes... close your eyes.
Bondo' s cancer looks nasty.
We must go for a marrow transplant.
The ultimate treatment is the only way.
Precisely what my therapist told me yesterday.
With a bit of luck I' il be giving up all this doctoring and management.
You can open your eyes now.
Spirits!
Spirits!
Spirits...
More!
More!
More!
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Thank you.
You should have had far more lessons.
Well, now that' s broken, too.
Are you injured, Mummy?
lf those were birds of passage, there certainly were a lot.
This is what we' ve confiscated from patients today alone.
Doesn' t the DG want to see it?
Ugh, they don' t look nice at all.
May we talk to the patient who' s confessed to using poultices?
I think she would really like to relieve her conscience.
I think we' il do something else.
That patient is interesting.
I' d recommend talking to her...
Good morning, DG.
l want to see the minister of health now.
Often, company is the best medicine.
But... he is far too poorly.
But postoperative care is the alpha and omega.
There we must be strict.
No visits by high or low.
Out of my way, Moesgaard.
I am going to open the door.
Why not?
Because...
Because he' s been discharged.
The minister has been discharged.
Discharged?
I thought he was poorly?
People with such a sense of duty are hard on themselves.
We should be grateful to our members of parliament.
Parliament?
It' s neurosurgery' s charm.
You' re flat out one day, on your feet the next.
A lesson one otherwise only learns in the school of life.
Spare me life and your observations, Moesgaard.
I just hope he won' t say anything silly in the House.
Christmas is coming and the goose is getting fat...
I think I can hear him.
We all do.
Great men often leave an echo.
He has infected the other patients.
They imitate his voice.
Due to the scourge of the hospital.
Our commitment to the city dwellers.
The lower classes cannot distinguish their own personalities from others'.
They are parasites, pure and simple.
Call me oldfashioned, but that' s what I think.
Mummy, come on!
Shhh!
Did you hear that?
It sounds like a keening.
As if from a wounded animal...
That' s because he opened the door and closed it again.
You master logic like you master the red songbook.
When you don' t need to!
There is something terribly wrong.
Why is the animal in such pain?
Come on, Bulder!
This place is turning into a zoo.
What do you want?
I haven' t time for all this nonsense.
I don' t want you.
Little Brother does.
Hello, Hook...
I thought you might be the right person to persuade mummy.
I so much want to die.
But mummy won' t help me.
lf the freak on the wall wants to die help him to do so as soon as possible.
lf we protect all the deformed, the world will drown in crud.
It' s so fucking... public.
You are sick.
He is sick.
And you are sick if you can' t see that the weak must be purged.
You are the weak one. lf you had but a fraction of his strength you' d be big enough to let everything around you live.
That' s enough crap.
lf he wants to die, let him.
No!
You mustn' t die.
I want you to live.
Do you hear?
I want you to live.
They are marching up and down a lot today.
And when they' ve marched back and forth for a whole day they think they' ve come an awful long way.
They are ants.
They do bustle about!
They bustle when they oughtn' t.
Somebody' s poked a stick into the heap to see them run round themselves.
They dropped that medicine in 1994.
It didn' t work on tennis elbow after all.
Tennis elbow?
I have epicondylites laterales humeri sinister.
Like I said.
Tennis elbow.
They said it could be serious.
Yes, on Centre Court.
Ouch!
Let go of me!
Yes, when you' ve explained how I ended up in the archives again with another Danish cretin.
Pappi!
Such buddies!
I' m going on a kind of course in the old buildings for a week.
Do you want to borrow the car while I' m away?
Of course chacun a son gout and all that, but for motorway driving you can' t beat an Audi.
My choice is purely aesthetic.
An ugly or a beautiful death?
Helmer and Camilla are both killing me.
I' ve got problems of my own.
Tell Camilla it' s over and swot for your exam.
You obviously don' t know the Moesgaard motto.
What' s that?
A challenge is a challenge.
Deep, very deep. lsn' t 1600 pages in two days enough of a challenge?
No.
There must be an honourable way out.
Our inheritance and our gift from the pain of generations!
Thank you for the gift of allowing me to be a real Bondo.
Thanks for the joy that fills me now as I dream of the intellect that is my family' s indelible badge of nobility.
The body may deceive but never intellect.
There will be no classes with me for a while.
I' m embarking on the preliminaries for a marrow transplant.
Hopefully we shall meet again when I emerge on the other side.
ls that good?
Can you feel it?
Yes.
Great.
I am a chicken.
I am a chicken.
Yes, I' m a real chicken.
I' m a chicken.
So what are you?
I' m a chicken.
So what are you?
Don' t just repeat me.
Answer the question.
Yes.
What was the question?
I am a chicken, damn it.
ls that a question?
I' ve had it up to here.
Please be horrid to Einar, all of you.
Really horrid.
Until he figures out whether he wants to play or not.
Fair enough.
When do I get my little Wednesday prezzie, eh?
You' ve only just had your little Tuesday prezzie.
We don' t want to spoil you.
Go easy on your husband.
See how fine he looks?
And how hard he works!
You have become a greater man.
lf the word "Danish" didn' t sound so hollow, I' d have called you that.
How' s it going, Bondo?
Splendidly, thanks.
I' m ready for the transplant.
That' s the problem.
We can' t find a donor.
Not so far, anyway.
Normally we look for compatibility in the family, but you have nobody.
A shame.
There was talk of a halfbrother.
My father was a virile fellow.
Great intellects are, you know.
A half brother would be fine.
He' d be a real Bondo.
The brethren send their respects.
Even Helmer has acquired new zeal.
My desire and ambition is but one.
I desire to become a duck, only a duck, nothing but a duck.
Dear Brethren.... and this duck...
Nivesen thinks he has such a good grip on the DG that we may permit ourselves one of our bolder activities.
To ensure a superficial knowledge of the occult we are fighting,
I have invited Mrs. Drusse to join us.
She has agreed to come tomorrow evening for a seance and a talk about alternative medicine.
Please consider whom we should choose as our central medium.
It' s at Mrs. Drusse' s request.
We need a man who is not a slave of his intellect and whose ego is particularly weak.
Where the hell has Moesgaard got to?
Get into pairs....
Come on.
Yes?
Why not Einar?
I don' t like him.
But Einar is in our group.
I see.
Something is happening.
Do you sense it?
We have made progress.
Good.
He hasn' t paid.
Hasn' t he paid?
I' m sure I' ve paid.
Show me the receipt.
What the devil are you playing at?
Wednesday was the last day.
This is dated Thursday.
Professor Helmer is coming.
What is this?
Do the alcoholics from other wards send you beer?
No, it was for us...
lf you address the crate to yourself...... with the yellow flag...... it goes all round the system, through all the buildings, and back again.
It' s a paternoster.
A kind of dumb waiter.
Yellow flag out...... and the crate comes back to you.
It comes back?
It' s really...
Completely idiotic.
The idiocy embodied in this phenomenon tells you everything about the efficiency of this hospital....
Extra strong lager, too.
No, it isn' t extra strong, it' s... it' s low alcohol.
Low?
Where does it say that?
It' s an ordinary beer.
The yellow... is just like the Swedish flag.
An ordinary beer.
Aage is a demon.
And a demon is a personification of Satan.
Demons only come when they are called...
Do you see, Bulder?
Yes, no, I mean no...
Somewhere in these buildings someone is calling!
When the plane shot upwards the big building was on our right and to one side was the fountain pond.
So prettily illuminated.
It' s not the hospital.
It' s the masons.
The masonic lodge?
That' s what we have to get into.
We can' t.
There are lots of tests and things.
Not that kind of in.
Just where they go in for it.
Go in for what?
Where they go in for Satan.
I thought they went in for body building.
And I' m not doing that.
How many years will society have her round its neck?
70 years?
70 times, say, half a million.
That' s 35 million.
35 million!
No wonder the tax payers feel cheated, eh?
Go back to your den, Hook, Mona doesn' t need this.
No, Darling, not now.
She doesn' t understand a word of it.
I don' t want to hear it either.
Lovely, eh?
Having the entire hospital at your beck and call?
But luckily some people have begun listening to what I have to say.
Don' t feel too safe, my dear.
Yuck, damn you!
Mummy!
The entire hospital is going crazy.
It' s getting to be beyond me.
It can' t be stopped; all you can do is look out for your dear ones.
Aage offered to save you, and you said no.
Don' t you see that the only thing that matters is keeping you alive?
And if it' s on your father' s terms, so what?
What do good and evil matter if you' re dead?
lf I have to live my life without my baby?
All my life I wanted a baby.
I' ve been waiting for you all my life.
I know it' s hard for you, Mummy.
It' s really horrid.
Of course resisting gets harder and harder the more it hurts.
But if father could do this to me and you, and do all he has done to the Kingdom, what might his kind do to the rest of the world?
I don' t care about the rest of the world.
Yes, today and maybe tomorrow.
But not for always.
My death is so infinitely small.
It hurts me and you.
But there are only the two of us, and the world is so big, so big, as you have sung for me.
I beg you to help me do it.
lf you love me, you can let me be the one to decide.
Can' t you mend it?
It' s all worn out.
Wow, how super!
People can wear out, too.
So can love for children and grownups and goodness and friendship, all these things can wear out and break down.
Then slightly right.
lf you hit the crash barrier just straighten up without getting scared.
Driving blindfold into the oncoming traffic without getting scared?
I' il tell you when you reach the bridge.
Then you use your wipers.
Now you can see.
Piece of cake.
Christian, I think I' ve got something.
Remember the rumours about Helmer plagiarising in Lund?
I' ve got the writer' s phone number.
He' il have some dirt on Helmer.
Christian?
Sanne...
Sanne...
But I don' t dare any more.
I' m afraid.
And the terrible thing is, the money' s promised to someone.
You see?
Am I boring?
Am I boring because I don' t dare do it?
I like you the way you are.
You don' t have to be anyone else.
Just be a good doctor.
That' s how you must make your money.
I' d like to talk to Dr. Jnsson.
Ahah?
He' s coming in tomorrow morning?
l' il try again tomorrow morning, ja.
Because it is very important, very important.
To get to the lodge you go back to Bleachpond Road.
Mummy!
The pendulum wants to go this way.
Mummy...
Take a lamp, Bulder.
Mummy, this can' t be the masons.
No, we' re far too deep.
Downwards!
Let the weak perish that the strong may reign in the Chaos of Darkness!
Come on, Bulder!
What a mess!
Yes, and it' s going to get worse.
It is hard to decline such power.
May I stay here a bit?
God, I was scared.
And really I am not the one you should fear.
I can take the pain away.
And death.
Together we can save your child, Judith.
It takes but a word.
How vexing!
He' s gone.
No, he' s taken the lift.
He' s getting off at Neurosurgery.
The evil could be me.
Yes, maybe it is us.
Maybe it isn' t.
And our uncertainty is the beauty of it all.
It' s a very interesting situation if someone from our very own neurosurgery ward is in the evil camp.
Bulder, it' s time to play.
Play?
Yes, we' re going to play associations.
Archibald and I used to play.
The dirty old man!
One person says a word and the other person responds with another without pause for thought.
The trick is that the response can be extremely revealing.
The hierarchy of hell is tremendously important.
Rather like it is here.
lf I can sneak in the name of one of the rulers of hell...... such as Beelzebub, who attained the rank of Grand Duc
I may be sure it will pay off.
The evil one, who has the correct imprinted knowledge, will be unable to refrain from responding with his own rank.
Let' s try it, Bulder.
Mummy, there' s nothing imprinted in me.
You don' t say...
Just say the first word that enters your mind.
Let' s begin.
Green.
Beer bottle.
See how easy it is?
Car.
Repairs.
Gin?
Tonic.
Biscuits.
Under the cupboard.
I told you you' d taken them.
You see, it works.
But whom shall we try it out on?
Who from neurosurgery could be the evil one?
Yes, it' il be quite a job doing the whole hospital like this.
But I can' t think of a better method of paring away the worst of the hospital' s fat.
Can we be friends again now, Mummy?
I' m sorry, Darling.
Of course we can be friends.
I love you.
But no more silly talk about me doing anything to you, eh?
I won' t ask you to do anything, I promise.
Oh, maybe you could get some more cotton buds to moisten my lips?
I should' ve realised.
I can' t take any more, Mummy.
Why didn' t you tell me it hurt so much?
Mummy...
Darling...
It' s no good.
Mummy, I want to be your little baby.
From now on, you make the decisions.
Sleep an hour or two.
We' il talk about it when you wake up.
I can' t get hold of that Jnsson bloke.
My viva is any minute.
I feel like hell.
Use the adrenaline to move about.
lnstead of making you nervous...
Who shall we try?
Does anyone here look suspicious?
l think the dark side requires a modicum of intelligence.
Hook looks funny.
His trip to the crematorium did him no good.
But he' s not our man.
He helped us with Mary.
Pear tree.
ldiot.
Little blue balloons?
Tiedown.
Beelzebub?
Compulsory lobotomy.
Stig?
Stig?
Bondo needs a marrow transplant.
Sadly, sadly, sadly.
I' d love to help, but I' ve got a viva.
They can' t find a donor.
He' s no relatives, poor man.
He won' t survive unless they find someone.
Mummy, shall we...
Bulder, my boy, I have something to tell you.
What?
Something I have kept to myself for years.
I want you seated.
It' s about your father.
My father?
Yes, but sit down first.
Don' t you ever do as you' re told?
Never mind who I am.
I want to give you a tipoff.
I think the girl is trying to tell you something.
Let Mona play with her bricks.
She' il tell you something important about Dr. Helmer.
But get a move on, while she' s still fairly lucid.
Stop, you old reprobate!
Helmer, damn it, We' il be late!
Had you forgotten that we have to haul Moesgaard' s son through?
How about picking a question?
Very good.
It' s always good to reach out into the periphery of the syilabus.
Right, Mogge, how much can you tell us about amylase?
Amylase?
Yes.
All that remains is to decide on your grade.
Has Dr. Jnsson arrived?
He has?
Thank you.
Hello, this is Mogens Moesgaard from the Kingdom, Copenhagen.
I' m inquiring about your former boss, Stig Helmer.
I understand there were a few... how shall I put it... problems.
Can you tell me anything about him that I don' t know?
You' d be happy to?
Bondo!
Listen!
I' ve got good news and bad news.
The good news is that we' ve found your half brother.
And he' s agreed to donate marrow.
It turns out that he works at the hospital.
Let me see him!
Yes, well...
What does he specialise in?
I' m already looking forward to swapping theories with him.
Let me see him, this bearer of the thousandyearold Bondo intellect!
Well, that' s the bad news.
Bro.
ls he tired?
Come along.
Yes?
You are horrid and selfish.
Let me stop for a moment...
You must say thank you.
This is for your own sake.
Come on.
Bastard.
Thank you.
Say thank you after she' s hit you.
Thank you.
I think my awakening is on its way.
Thanks to all of you.
I feel the need to be alone.
Einar, what are you feeling?
Anger.
With whom?
What are they doing?
From what?
All I want to do for myself.
And what is that?
To be a doctor.
Say that again?
To be a doctor.
I' il tell them that I' ve had enough.
And my clothes.
Then I' il return to my ward, my management duties.
And my hospital.
Here I come!
I' il tell them to their faces that a Moesgaard wishes to speak.
A Moesgaard walks upright.
A Moesgaard does not flee in the dark down two sheets tied together!
I' ve considered what you said.
That it seemed to be a setup.
I have the same nasty feeling.
Aha?
What can we do?
lf the lodge really is behind it all, I wouldn' t recommend sanctions.
The lodge is not to be trifled with.
You think we should bow to the lodge and do nothing?
I' d advise you to call off tonight' s patrol.
Provoke them?
Go home.
That' s what I' d do.
By the way, my compliments on being such a great man.
What do you mean?
The article in this week' s Medical Journal where they debate whether this hospital needs a DG at all seeing as the place is run by the consultants.
Splendid of you not to stoop to a defence!
Thank you, Nivesen.
A fine move, DG.
The Journal, you say?
Yes.
Good night.
I' ve never found it so hard to agree.
For Moesgaard' s sake I' d give him a 7 and just pass him.
I admit that he was somewhat incoherent.
But less than a 7 has never been awarded to a lodge member' s son.
Don' t fail him with less than a 3!
All right, if you say so.
Let' s stop here.
Helmer...
We couldn' t give you much.
May I pass on greetings to my external examiner?
8 personal greetings from the village of Borås.
Jnsson...
We could only give you a 3.
I hate mediocrity.
Party discipline on the local council back home taught me to hate.
I am a duck, I am a duck, I am a duck, I know it.
lt' s got to be an 11, cum laude.
lf you say so, Helmer.
He' s here.
Hi, Bro!
Let' s extract that marrow!
The last dance before we go home
Before the sun again does roam
Still I hold you close
Still the night is ours
Lovely the last dance
Before we go I meet your lips
Before we go home
For a brief second Before we go home
The night is over
I whisper goodnight
l kiss you see you soon
I have never
Felt heaven as close as now.
At Christmas it shall come to pass.
Our time will soon be over.
Will you marry me?
Yes, I will.
Good.
A two?
Well done, Mogge.
Only 0 or 3.
Mogge thinks you' re brave to have come here.
Yes, I' m ready now.
Sanne!
Come on...
There.
I' il run you home.
I' ve got dad' s car.
You need to get your strength back.
What a buzz!
An 11!
Helmer...
Helmer...
Good morning.
The staircase.
Hello, Camilla.
How is your son?
Fine, thanks, they' ve finished.
He always takes his time sleeping it off.
The anaesthetic?
ln this case.
I' m so confused, I can' t get anything right.
I' ve developed a method... a game of associations.
It tells one so much about people.
Yes, I' ve played it a lot.
It' s great fun.
Yes, because people give you such different answers.
I mean, what would you say to bubble and squeak?
Leftovers?
How about Orangutan?
Dr. Helmer.
Sorry, I don' t know what got into me.
Oh, dear, how funny!
Prawn cocktail.
Thousand island.
Emu?
Three letter animal.
The Hebrides?
Stiff nor' westerly.
How about Beelzebub?
Grand Duc.
What did you say?
You said Beelzebub.
So I replied Grand Duc.
Beelzebub, Grand Duc, Lucifer,
Empereur, Satanachia,
Grand General.
What have you done?
Accursed bitch!
Good evening.
I' m the DG and I' m making an inspection.
Nobody is to stop me!
No, of course not.
First, the minister.
I don' t think he' s here.
Maybe he' s been discharged?
But DG, Sir!
It is unlocked.
It opens outwards.
It' s the new kind... at your suggestion.
So we could get more beds in.
Stop!
I have some management questions.
I am the DG.
Hey, stop!...
Surely I can handle the patients...
That' s an order!
Sorry, but I' ve very little time.
At once!
I' il get you!
This is the police.
What have you done with the girl?
I am the highest authority in this hospital.
You' re a consultant?
Open up!
ln the name of the law!
Frightened...
Frightened...
Frightened...
Grown ups can be frightened, too.
Can I be of service?
We thought you' d taken...
I mean...
Yes?
What?
The girl was missing.
And you ran...
Yes, ran...
But efficiency isn' t illegal here, or what does the DG say?
It' s a disciplinary offence not to move laundry to the laundry, and nowhere else.
Thank you.
It seems the good Mrs Drusse is late so let' s get started.
I' ve mugged up on this kind of tomfoolery.
We have to decide whom to invoke.
The DG' s better self?
Bob' s better self?
It won' t be easy.
Let' s try... ls our central medium ready?
Come on, Bob...
Come on, Bob...
Are you awake now?
What is going to happen, Mummy?
Have you made up your mind?
An hour ago I was sure I' d do a deal with Aage.
I was about to call him when I remembered what Drusse said about the spirits.
That when one was ready, one could see them.
So I came up here and all at once
I really could see them.
I understand now what you said, that we are all part of something greater and the fact that together we belong on the side of good renders everything else insignificant.
They love you, and they trust you.
Though you matter more to me than anything in the world,
I can' t force you to go against your nature and your convictions.
I will help you to die.
It was for such a brief instant.
But I wouldn' t have done without you for all the world.
Mummy...
Yes, my beloved?
It must be now.
While we still can.
I' d like to baptise you.
Then I should like to be called Frederik, like the Crown Prince.
Babies who do not live to bear a name are given the king' s name.
Of course you shall have the king' s name.
I baptise you Frederik.
ln the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Thank you, Mummy.
I thank you, Frederik.
No, not by injection, Mummy.
I dare not.
I don' t want to be asleep when it happens.
You must release me, Mummy.
I know we can do it.
Together.
I can' t do it.
You can.
I love you, Mummy.
Sing for me.
And the forest black
Now the sun is dead, Mummy...
No!
Oh!
Hello?...
Can anyone hear me?
I can' t open the door.
He' s about to start.
Falcon is about to go.
I' ve put a month' s wages on him.
Take over for ten minutes, OK?
We' re about to test the Emergency Power Supply.
The mains will cut out and the generators will cut in.
Just turn the mains power back on via the red button if the generator fails to start.
But it always does.
Don' t touch anything else, specially the big levers.
It' d be easy to exterminate the weaker patients.
Falcon, are you ready?
We' re ready here.
5000 on red.
No, I' il put it on black.
I don' t think he' il make it today.
Not blind.... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, go!
This won' t do.
It won' t do at all.
I' ve staked a month' s wages.
And you' re not even cheering.
I don' t like that, shorty.
There he is!
Mogge, it' s daddy.
There he is, the bastard!
Catch him!
After him!
Where in hell did he go?
He' s screwed us all.
Who has?
Moesgaard.
It' s all his fault.
I' il bet it is.
I should' ve known it.
Good evening, Bob.
Director General, I mean.
I' ve damned well had enough.
Bob, Bob, you' ve had your day The lodge will make you go away...
Like that, is it?
ls this how you combat the occult?
This will cost you dear.
I shall inform the minister himself.
Hello, Bob... actually I only receive people on Thursdays.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
You shouldn' t be here.
Oh, this is my place.
My job.
Work?
What are you on about?
I am death.
Yes, it' s going to be a busy night.
What have I done?
What have I done?
Hello there!
Oh, not again!
The generators will start in a moment.
We keep a lot of people alive by machinery.
Control!
Come in!
Where the hell are you?
Talk to me!
Talk to me!
Come in, Falcon!
Falcon, are you there?
Falcon, come in!
It' s Christian.
Where the hell is the EPS?
ln a few seconds we' il have the biggest hospital disaster in modern times.
Aage Krüger!
Give me back my baby!
The sun turned so red, mum
And the night so black
Little Brother' s dead, mum And Mona can' t come back
Aage' s roaming out there, mum So we lock our doors
There' s a draught upon my pillow, mum
Will the Kingdom be as before?
My name in all humility remains Lars von Trier and I wish you yet again the obligatory good evening.
lf, despite what you have seen, you still wish to follow the Kingdom' s slalom course, spend more time with our little flock, and listen yet again to this gentleman' s flippant remarks, for Satan' s sake be prepared to take the Good with the Evil.
After a day like today all I need is for that idiot Jönsson from Lund to show his face.
Excuse me, my name is Jönsson, from Lund.
I bring greetings for Dr. Helmer from his wife and seven children in Borås.
Listen, here' s the thing.
If you can' t spot the sucker in your first half hour at the table, then you are the sucker.
It' s like any other job.
You don' t gamble.
You grind it out.
Your goal is to win one big bet an hour, that' s it.
Get your money in when you have the best of it, and protect it when you don' t.
Don' t give anything away.
That' s how I' ve paid my way through half of law school.
A true grinder.
See, I learned how to win a little at a time.
But finally, I' ve learned this...
If you' re too careful, your whole life can become a fuckin 'grind.
- [Man]
Five hundred.
Nope.
No?
What?
Give me three stacks of high society.
Thirty thousand.
Count it.
- That' s good.
- So, you' re sitting the apple.
Want a cookie?
- No.
He doesn' t look like much, but KGB is connected all the way to the top of the Russian mob.
He' s the one guy in the game you don' t want to fuck with.
But if you' re looking for high stakes, this is the only place in town.
They all know me as a small- timer, but that' s about to change.
Joey Knish is a New York legend.
He' s been a rounder, earning his living at cards... since he was 19 years old.
Uh, yeah, I' m holding 'em for you.
- [Chuckles]
[Narrating]
He' s as close to a friend as there is in this place.
- [Narrator]
But tonight, I don' t want to see him.
Now, you don' t wanna butt onions with these guys.
'Cause they' il chew you up, take your whole bankroll.
- So you say.
- There' s plenty of easy games.
We get outta here, get some coffee, ride over to that soft seat in Queens.
I know what I' m doing.
You' re making a run at it, aren' t you?
Rolling up a stake and going to Vegas.
I' m right, right?
- I can beat the game.
- Maybe.
Maybe this is a game can be beat.
But you know you can beat the 10- 20 at the Chesterfield and the Hi- Low... at that goulash joint on 79th Street.
Okay.
I understand.
I understand.
[Narrating]
The game in question is No- Limit Texas Hold 'Em.
Minimum buy- in $25, 000.
A game like this doesn' t come together often outside the casinos.
The stakes attract rich flounders, and they in turn attract the sharks.
No- Limit Texas Hold 'Em is the Cadillac of poker.
Each player is dealt two cards face down.
Five cards are then dealt face up across the middle.
These are community cards everyone can use to make the best five card hand.
The key to the game is playing the man, not the cards.
There' s no other game in which fortunes can change so much from hand to hand.
A brilliant player can get a strong hand cracked, go on tilt... and lose his mind along with every single chip in front of him.
This is why the World Series of Poker is decided over a No- Limit Hold 'Em table.
Some people, pros even, won' t play No- Limit.
They can' t handle the swings.
But there are others, like Doyle Brunson, who consider No- Limit the only pure game left.
Like Papa Wallenda said... "Life is on the wire.
The rest is just waiting. "
Pass it to you.
All right, I raise.
- I' m gonna raise five hundred.
Fold.
I call it.
[Narrating]
- [Narrating]
I just got top two pair on the flop, and I want to keep him in the hand.
Against your average guy, I' d set a bear trap, hardly bet at all.
But KGB' s too smart for that.
So, what I' ve got to do is over- bet the pot, make it look like I' m trying to buy it.
- I bet $2, 000.
- Then he plays back at me, and I get paid off.
Call.
[Narrating]
Burn and turn.
[Narrating]
There' s my money card, nine of hearts.
I got a full house.
- To the bettor.
- Check' s good.
[Narrating]
Now I hope a spade falls and Teddy makes his flush.
That way he' il bet strong, and I' il beat him with my nines full over aces.
I' m going to bet...
Bet... $15, 000.
[Narrating]
I want him to think that I' m pondering a call, but all I' m really thinking about is Vegas and the fucking Mirage.
All right, your 15, plus I have another 33 to raise you.
Um...
Yeah, I' m gonna go all in, 'cause I don' t think you got the spades.
You are right.
[Narrating]
I know before the cards are even turned over.
Aces full, Mike.
Come on.
- No.
I' m down to the felt, Knish.
I lost everything.
Man, I lost my case money.
I lost my tuition.
Time to time, everyone goes bust.
You' il be back in the game before you know it.
I' m done.
I' m out of it.
They all say that at first.
Hey, man, let me stake you.
Standard deal, you know.
Fifty percent of your winnings.
If you lose, it' s on me.
I' d just throw it away.
- You still got the truck?
- Sure.
Come on.
[Mike Narrating]
You don' t hear much about guys who take their shot and miss, but I' il tell you what happens to 'em.
They end up humping crappy jobs on graveyard shifts, trying to figure out how they came up short.
See, I had this picture in my head.
Me sitting at the big table, Doyle to my left,
Amarillo Slim to my right, playing in the World Series of Poker.
And I let that vision blind me at the table against KGB.
Now, the closest I get to Vegas is west New York, driving this lousy route handed down from Knish... to rounders who forget the cardinal fuckin 'rule...
Always leave yourself outs.
- Hey, Moogie.
- Let me ask you a question.
In a legal sense, can fuckin 'Steinbrenner just move the Yankees?
I don' t know.
How should I know that?
- You didn' t learn that yet?
- No, we get to Steinbrenner in the third year of law school.
- Take care, man.
- Yeah.
- [Chattering]
- [Poker Chips Clattering]
[Mike Narrating]
The judges' game.
I' d heard about it for years on the street, before I was even in law school.
A rotating group of ten or twelve judges, prosecutors and professors.
They all have money, and in my playing days... it would have been pretty sweet to have any one of them owing me favors.
Only problem is, no one can get in the game anymore.
One rounder, Crispy Linetta, sat under some pretense, but they found out he was a pro, he couldn' t cross the street without a legal hassle.
Even his regular club, Vorshay' s, got shut down.
Oh, Michael.
- You got some things for me?
- Yes, I do.
Kid, he paying you for this late night shit?
Oh, well, knowledge is my reward, sir.
- [Chuckles]
- Let me tell you, it ain' t worth it.
Why don' t you become a jockey, do something useful.
- Kid' s a little tall, isn' t he, Gene?
- All right.
I call.
- Michael is lead counsel... in the Moot Court you' re presiding over next week, Gene.
Besides, he could use the background if he' s gonna... clerk for one of you fellas this summer, right?
Abe, I thought you liked the kid.
Why do you want to make him a civil servant?
Stay in the private sector.
They use our chips for coasters.
The amazing thing is, in this collection of great legal minds, there isn' t a single real card player.
- I call.
- Raise.
Mike?
Michael, I would have just called.
No, you' re good.
All right, I call.
[Mike Narrating]
- Good.
- [Clears Throat]
Check to Martin and Lewis over there.
- Check to the raiser.
- Czechoslovakia.
- What' s the limit? - $20.
Big bet' s $20.
Okay.
There' s $20.
You' ve seen half a hand.
You sure this is wise, Abe?
It' s plenty wise.
We know what we' re holding, and we know what you' re holding.
[Chuckles]
The fuck you know what we all got.
I don' t bet with jobs like that.
Let' s just say I' il put you at the top of the list if you' re right.
Okay.
[Clears Throat]
The D. A. made his two pair, but he knows they' re no good.
Judge Kaplan was trying to squeeze out a diamond flush, but he came up short, and Mr. Eisen is futilely hoping that his queens are gonna stand up.
So, like I said, the Dean' s bet is $20.
- Well, kiss my ass.
- Kiss my ass.
[Group Laughs]
- What' d you have, Abe?
- Nothin 'but a busted straight.
- It' s good enough to win.
Pull up a seat next to me.
Oh, I' d like to.
I can' t, I can' t.
I don' t play cards.
- See you tomorrow.
- My deal.
- I like the kid, Abe.
[Mike Narrating]
I tell ya, it' s hard leaving that game.
An open invitation to lay with those lambs.
But I' m retired.
The truth is, I can always find games, though.
Easy games, tough games, straight games, crooked games, home games.
I can turn this truck onto the Jersey Turnpike and be at the Taj in two hours.
But I' ve made promises.
Hello?
- Hey.
- How' d it go?
[Sighs]
I am sick of that fucking route.
Don' t worry.
- I' m really late.
- Oh, just stay here.
[Chuckles]
- [Chuckles]
We both know that' s not true.
Besides, you should get some sleep.
These fuckin 'long nights are killing me.
They never used to.
Yeah, well, that' s different.
I mean, that was like... buy in at 8: 00, next thing you know it' s morning.
But hey, you know, I think I' m hooked up for this summer.
Hooked up how?
Well, after I left you last night at the library, I impressed Judge Marinacci.
I think I might be in line for a clerkship.
Tell me more.
Well, those guys were all playing cards, and...
Just hear me out now, hear me out.
They were playing cards and I read his hand blind.
So, instead of coming home, you went and played cards with some judge?
No, I wasn' t even playing.
They were playing.
I just caught his eye by reading his hand, that' s all.
I mean, as long as I don' t fuck up Moot Court, I think the job' s mine.
What kind of job is that gonna be, Mike?
Writing an opinion on high- stakes poker?
Honey, you' re the one who told me... that I should use my poker skills in the courtroom.
You know what I meant.
I meant that you should use your head.
That' s what I meant.
- Honey, con?
I was networking.
Oh, God.
Networking.
No.
I don' t think you get it.
You' il be just like one of those ex- college athletes.
It' s true.
I just think if you get in this way, you' il always be a hustler to them.
Baby, I didn' t even play.
I' il see you later.
- Hey, hon, can I take the Jeep tomorrow?
- Yeah, where?
Uh, Worm' s gettin 'out.
I was gonna pick him up.
Tomorrow.
Beautiful.
I promised I' d be there, hon.
I just can' t believe you still know someone called "Worm."
Shit.
[Mike Narrating]
I met Worm at Dwight Inglewood Preparatory Academy over in Jersey.
We were the only two kids attending who didn' t have a trust fund.
It said "Custodian" on the door.
That' s why they took me.
- [Makes Buzzer Sound]
W- Was that, like, your strong finish or something?
- Motherfucker!
- You leave me no choice, the way you play.
Dowling had it three hands ago, and two hands ago I got the black Maria, so I don' t want to hear you bitchin ', okay?
- Yeah, but he shot the moon on that hand, didn' t he?
- Yeah, I saw that.
- So it helped you.
- Now...
Okay, you' re right.
You ain' t walking outta here with our grits, Worm.
You know the drill, okay?
I' m not gonna smoke 'em.
I' il hold on to 'em. if you want' em back, you can trade me for 'em, or try to play double or nothing tomorrow.
Murphy!
You' re processed.
Processed?
This motherfucker' s gettin 'the jump.
Come on, man, have some decency here, Worm.
You can buy all the smokes you want in half an hour.
- What are you talking about?
- You don' t even smoke, Worm.
You know that?
If you' re determined to die of cancer, you really oughta learn how to play cards.
Ain' t a good idea to add insult to injury, yo.
- That shit will come back and hurt you.
Not in this lifetime.
Enjoy your time.
Murphy.
[Mike Narrating]
Worm' s dad did the grounds, when he wasn' t too fuckin 'drunk.
That' s when we did 'em.
Of course, the grounds weren' t all we did.
Worm put us into a scam a day on all the young aristocrats we went to school with... selling 'em dime bags of oregano, nunchakus and firecrackers from Chinatown.
- Where' s the rest?
- Thank you.
- Until the time we went for... more than just pocket change and got caught.
We had the starting five take a dive against Friends Academy.
The point guard snapped and gave Worm up.
They hauled him up before the school board, offered him a deal.
Tell us who else was involved, and we' il go easy on you.
Worm didn' t say a fuckin 'word.
- I stayed in school and graduated.
[Bell Rings]
- Mike McD.
- Aw, man.
- I would have been there every week if you let me, man.
I couldn' t let you see me in this shit hole.
You look great, man.
- You too, you too.
- No, no.
It was a piece of cake.
Piece of cake.
Man, look at your ride.
You' ve been prospering while I' ve been away.
- What have you been up to?
- I borrowed it.
Just get in it and drive me far away from here.
There' s like two whole economies in there... there' s cash and there' s trade.
So I gotta keep three games going at once, all right?
A game with the white guys, a game with the brothers, and a game with the guards.
- It' s just me all alone.
Come here.
Isn' t that beautiful?
It' s like an ace up my sleeve.
Wait till I show you some of my chops, man.
I' ve gotten pretty blinding.
- It' s like, it' s like, you know...
- All right.
It' s gonna blow your mind, blow your mind.
You been working?
Is your game sharp?
No, man, I' m off it.
What, are you... you gettin 'cold cards?
No, man, I mean I quit.
- [Laughs]
What, are you shitting me?
- No, man, I...
- I got cleaned out.
- Mike McD?
You lost?
Yeah, man, I...
It was a real blood game over at KGB' s place.
Yeah.
I didn' t want to tell you while you were in there.
I didn' t want to dispirit you like that.
Jesus, what were you thinking?
So, you' re just a student now?
- What are you doing for money?
- I' m driving Knish' s truck.
- No, no, no, I' m off it.
You are, huh?
I know a game perfect for the two of us.
- I' il drop you...
I' il drop you off.
No, I' m really off it.
- I know, I know.
This is it, this is it.
So get this, here' s the plan.
I know this girl Barbara.
She' s fuckin 'hot.
I was this close to bangin 'her when they sent me away.
She works as a hostess for all these fuckin 'trust fund babies in here.
She got me into their little game.
That' s a nice hookup.
It' s all the way nice.
There' s only one problem.
- What feeling is that, exactly?
- You know this feeling very well.
- Uh- huh.
- Yeah.
- You just don' t have the stake.
- Exactly.
Glad you understand.
Whoa, Jesus, what have you been livin 'on?
I' m livin 'a little light, I told you.
- Anyway, that' s $220, so that' il get you started. - $220, I mean...
Hey, thanks, but I mean, that' s, like, 11 bets.
I mean, I can' t even get a table on this...
I' il straighten you out in the city tomorrow.
No way.
I gotta get started.
[Chuckles]
I mean, I' m already behind here.
What' s the big fuckin 'hurry?
- How much do you owe?
- Like, ten.
- I can' t even figure it with the juice.
Hey, look, I can get started on this easy if it' s you and me working together.
I heard you asking before, and I hear you asking now, but I can' t do that.
I just can' t do that.
I' ve made promises.
Hey, you know what?
What am I saying?
It' s fine.
- But thanks, I appreciate it.
- I' il catch you in the city tomorrow?
- Yeah.
Fuckin 'great to see ya.
[Mike Narrating]
In Confessions of a Winning Poker Player, Jack King said,
"Few players recall big pots they have won, strange as it seems,
"but every player can remember with remarkable accuracy... the outstanding tough beats of his career."
'Cause walking in here,
- Hi.
- Barbara.
Worm said you' d be running a little late.
Just follow me.
I probably won' t even sit.
You know, just kinda keep him company.
No, no, that' s not gonna work.
Here' s the play... you' re my new boyfriend, you' re looking for a regular game.
Really?
Worm tells me that' s precisely what you are.
My cut is 25 per cent.
- I see.
- Good.
- [Group]
Hello, Michael.
[Barbara]
Be nice to him.
- Leave him enough money to buy me breakfast.
- [Laughter]
- Good luck.
- You know Chicago?
- Stud game.
Okay, well, deal me in, I guess.
Okay.
- That' s two on you, Murph.
- Oh, yeah.
- I' m in.
- I' m gonna make it five.
Worm and I fall into our old rhythm like Clyde Frazier and Pearl Monroe.
We bring out all the old school tricks, stuff that would never play in the city... signalling, chip placing, trapping.
- Raise.
I can probably crack the game just as quickly straight up, but there' s no risk in this room.
Now, some people might look down on Worm' s mechanics, call it immoral.
But as Canada Bill Jones said, "It' s immoral to let a sucker keep his money."
Like they teach you in One- L... caveat emptor, pal.
- I got the boat, queens over.
- [Chuckles]
[Chuckles]
He asked you if that stung, Birch.
[Mike Narrating]
Worm really has become an artist, too.
Discard culls, pickup culls, overhand run ups, the Double Duke...
A few times, I have to fold the case on him, just so it won' t be obvious.
Still, he plays the part of the loser to perfection.
Flush.
I got the full house.
I got the queens over the aces.
Ahh, fuck!
- Fuck you and your never- ending string of boats, okay?
- Hey.
Well, my Uncle Les says when the money' s gone, it' s time to move on, so enjoy it, you secret handshaking assholes.
Hey, come back any time.
Your money' s always good here.
- [Door Closes]
- Good night, Mike.
See you next time.
You guys, uh, wanna keep playing?
How' d we do?
Oh, beautiful.
Fuckin 'assholes, they deserved it.
All right, $300, that' s your cut.
- Thank you very much, boys.
- Hey, you were great.
- When can we do this again?
- No, no, it was a one- time thing for me.
- Forget it.
- Two weeks?
- [Chuckles]
Hey, I had to try, right?
Hey, how' d you know I was coming back?
That' s easy.
Who' s your favorite actor?
Clint Eastwood.
The Outlaw Josey Wales, man.
He always doubles back for a friend.
Hey, we made good time.
Wanna get breakfast?
No, I gotta get home.
If she hasn' t already changed the locks on me.
This may not look like Teddy' s place, but it ain' t the Ivy Leagues either.
- Tough customers, huh?
- You won' t just get a finger up your spine.
- Okay, I hear ya.
- I' m playing straight.
- [Buzzes]
- How you doin ', Mikey?
- Good, how you doin '?
You know, um, the computer tried to delete you last week.
- Oh, yeah?
- But I knew you' d be back.
Oh, no, I' m not back, I just...
- It' s good to see you.
Um, this is Les Murphy.
He' s like my brother.
Call me Worm.
- [Phone Rings]
Don' t wiggle away.
Hey, what' s she wearing the button for?
- What are they playing?
- Uh, 20- 40 forced rotation.
Is that Fat Greggie sitting 20- 40?
Yeah.
- No.
- Hell, yeah, I' m gonna play.
- Oh, come on, you' re not gonna walk away from this.
- Not gonna happen.
Mike, we could cut this room up in an hour.
All right, run along, then.
Say hi to her for me.
- Me, too.
- I will.
Take care of him.
Do you believe that?
She' s really got him by the balls.
- That' s not so bad, is it?
- Depends on the grip.
- Come on, give me $2, 000.
You heard Mike.
He' s good for it.
Look, I' m gonna triple that in half an hour, princess.
Let' s go.
Okay.
Hey.
Reunion run a little late?
I wasn' t sleeping.
Well, why don' t you change and we' il get a cab.
Um, why don' t you just go ahead, and I' m gonna jump in the shower.
Hey.
I mean, tell me you were out drinking till you threw up.
Tell me you were getting lap dances over at Scores.
- I don' t care, just give me something.
- I was entertaining Worm.
- The least I can do for the guy.
- So, you were nowhere near a card game.
What?
- I' m just...
- No.
All right?
I' il wait for you.
I mean, the key is a seamless passing of the baton among the team.
I think the most important thing is to be respectful to the judges but not obsequious.
Now, wait a minute.
Gene Marinacci won' t buy deferential.
Oh, it' s Gene, is it?
Sorry.
I couldn' t find a cab.
Anyway, when you make the opening remarks, make sure you stick to the fact pattern.
And use the right cites.
Use book cites, not Lexis.
- Long time.
- Knish.
How are you?
- Um...
- It' s important.
Excuse me.
- I' il act as lead counsel.
- It' s all right, Kelly.
We were gonna take a break anyway.
Did anybody else see him?
I heard it.
I didn' t know him, I might not have noticed.
I turn around, and I see him with the mechanic' s grip, I know.
- You want one?
- Did you give him the office?
I tried to warn him, but he looked right through me.
- All right, I' il go get him.
He' s okay now.
They can' t see straight.
Come on, I' il buy you a cup of coffee.
I' m gonna go get him.
[Mike Narrating]
Amarillo Slim, the greatest proposition gambler of all time, held to his father' s maxim...
Gotta bet my jacks.
This is a lesson Worm' s never bothered to learn.
- [Speaking Russian]
- Hey, guys.
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?
- You' re worried we might work together.
I' m sure you' re just talking about perogies... and snow and shit, but let' s cut it out, all right?
I think you got that ace, Roman, but I' m gonna pay for it.
- Ace.
- Oh, you got it.
- And six.
But I got sevens, too, though.
- With my jacks.
You said just jacks.
- Fuck!
- [Together]
Hey.
Hey, Mike, you here to play?
They' re putting a fucking bracelet on me tomorrow for four months.
- I already stuck two racks.
Can I talk to you for a second, Cosmonaut?
No, man, I' m on a roll.
Gotta do it.
- [Speaking In Russian]
- I counted these.
Leave it.
[Speaking In Russian]
- What' s going on?
- Where are you at?
- All right, listen.
- Hey, wait, I want a hot dog.
Oh, what, that fuckin 'Knish rat me out?
He sees all the angles, but he doesn' t have the balls to play one.
Hey, that guy hasn' t had to work in 15 years, Worm.
You don' t think that' s work, what he does?
Grinding it out on his fuckin 'leather ass?
No, thank you.
Now I know what real work is.
Speaking of which, are you even gonna get a job?
I was distributing.
Distributing.
It' s different, okay?
Second of all, I' m never going back there.
Stop worrying so much, okay?
Come here.
I just want you to think long term, all right?
Be smart.
Every place in Manhattan, they all keep books, all right?
If you get listed as a mechanic, then not only are you gonna get the shit kicked out of you, you' re not gonna get a fuckin 'game anywhere in New York.
It' s stupid.
It' s just bad business.
But it' s not me.
I don' t play the game straight up, and then if I lose, go get some real work or something, okay?
I see a mark, I take him down.
That' s what I do.
Listen, you' re the guy who taught me all the angles.
- But I' m not the guy with my nose open right now.
- Aw, come on.
Roman and Maurice?
Not as bad as KGB, but you don' t want to be fuckin 'with those guys.
Look, you still got time.
Just go back in there, right?
Lose their fuckin 'money back to' em, all right?
I can' t.
I gotta put some scratch together, man.
Play in a fuckin 'dentist' s game, okay?
- Go to Swan Meadow, play in the golf pro game.
- That' s an idea.
I' il definitely do that, but I can' t dump to these guys.
You got to.
All right, whatever, whatever.
Meet me at Stromboli' s in half an hour, all right?
I have a meeting.
And then I gotta go to fuckin 'Queens.
I gotta load the truck.
I' m never gonna see you.
- Make it look good.
- You know me.
- So, how' d you do?
- Ah, so- so.
Six thousand, two thousand.
Oh, hold on.
Two more.
You know what?
Why don' t you give me all of it?
Usually, credit players only leave with their profit.
Oh, okay.
[Sighs]
I' ve been looking all over for you.
Didn' t want to be found.
You know, Petrovsky waited and waited.
- Jo, look, I missed one meeting.
- It' s not about the meeting.
I don' t care about the meeting.
Do you even know why I left this morning?
- It' s not what you think.
- Who do you think I am?
You lie right to my face?
You lost everything, but at least you never lied.
This was like Wiffle Ball.
- Can you lose your rent playing Wiffle Ball?
- No, I couldn' t lose.
- That' s the point.
- No, Mike, you can lose.
- Jo, I wasn' t gonna lose!
Why does this still seem like gambling to you?
Why do you think the same five guys make it to the final table... at the World Series of Poker every single year?
- Great.
So why' d you have to lie to me?
- Because I knew you wouldn' t understand.
- Understand what?
Last night, I sat down at this card table.
I felt alive for the first time since I got busted at KGB' s joint, okay?
- No, what...
- You said you need me but it' s quarter to 2: 00 - I heard you was out.
- I was just thinkin 'about you.
- Oh, yeah?
See me in, like, two weeks.
I' il put you back on the payroll.
Well, I got some bad news for ya, Worm.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Go figure.
There were a lot of angry people when you went away.
I know, Grama, that' s why I' m trying to put together a roll here.
- So, it got me to thinkin '.
- Really, you thinkin 'now?
Hey, Jesus!
Come on!
It' s just a friend of mine.
Hey!
God!
Here' s what I' m thinkin '.
What?
Where the fuck do you get off?
[Grunts]
Ohh.
Here' s how it is.
25 grand, and the juice is still runnin '.
What the fuck are you doin ', man?
You were my partner.
No, no, I was your lackey.
[Scoffs]
Where' d you get the scratch for that?
- Still a wise ass.
Unbelievable.
- [Spits]
What I did was go partners with an old friend of yours.
Teddy KGB backed me.
Bullshit.
[Spits]
Why would he put you under his flag?
What, so you bought me up, Grama?
30 cents on the dollar.
Great, so you' re a banker now, Grama.
That' s really classy.
[Sighs]
Just take it easy, all right?
I' il scrape something together, and I' il find you this week.
- No, no, no.
Fine.
Have yourself a ball, okay?
[Sighs, Chuckles]
[Groans]
[Groans]
Excuse me.
Michael.
- It was wonderful.
- [Chuckles]
Marinacci and the D. A. were ready to cut cards for your services at that point.
Of course, it was an altogether different trick, that disappearing act... you pulled today at your group' s meeting.
- Yeah.
Well, I figure I owe you an explanation.
- Ah, not to me.
- [Chuckles]
Yeah.
- Okay, well, thanks.
- Stay.
- Jamie?
- Yeah?
- Another glass, darling.
- Sure.
- What are you drinking?
- Gin.
Always gin.
- Thanks, dear.
I' m no magician.
Well, if it wasn' t magic, how did you know what everyone held?
It' s a combination of things.
Um, I was watching when the cards came out.
That' s...
You watch the cards.
I watch the cards also, but I watch the players reacting to the cards.
That' s how I knew the D. A. made his two pair, and Judge Kaplan missed the flush.
I was watching their eyes when they checked their river cards.
- Their faces tell you everything.
- You watch the man.
I...
I never knew you had to calculate so much at cards.
All right, here' s the thing.
You only start with jacks or better split, nines or better wired, three high cards to a flush.
If it' s good enough to call, you gotta be in there raising, all right?
I mean, tight, but aggressive.
That' s your style, Professor.
I mean, you gotta... you gotta think of it as a war.
You are officially never invited to our game again.
[Chuckles]
I don' t blame you.
Put a guy like me in a game like that, the cards don' t even matter.
- May I tell you a story?
- Please.
For generations, men of my family have been rabbis.
In Israel, before that in Europe.
It was to be my calling.
I was quite a prodigy.
The elders said I had a 40- year- old' s understanding... of the midrash by the time I was 12.
I knew I could never be a rabbi.
Why not?
Because for all I understood of the Talmud,
I never saw God there.
- You couldn' t lie to yourself.
- I tried.
Tried like crazy.
I mean, people were counting on me.
But yours is a respectable profession.
Not to my family.
My parents were destroyed, devastated by my decision.
My father sent me away to New York... to live with distant cousins.
Eventually, I...
I found my place, my life' s work.
What then?
I immersed myself fully, I studied the minutiae,
I learned everything I could about the law.
I mean, I felt deeply inside that it was what I was born to do.
- And did your parents get over it?
- No.
I always hoped that I would find... some way to change their minds, but...
My father never spoke to me again.
If you had to do it all over again, would you make the same choices?
The last thing I took away from the yeshiva is this...
We can' t run from who we are.
Hey.
L' chayim.
Hey, where you been?
I' ve been freezing my ass off.
- What happened?
- Ah, ran into a door.
Don' t worry about it.
- What happened?
- Hey!
She crossed her legs too fast, all right?
- Just mind your own business.
No, I' ve been standing out here all this time just to say hi.
- Tone down what, motherfucker?
- Never mind.
- [Laughs]
Shut up.
What, did you get robbed?
Did she split on you?
[Scoffs]
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
Mike, she made off with your sheets.
- Know exactly when to release a shitty hand.
- Come on, Mike, forget that.
This girl is obviously wrapped way too tight for living.
I knew it.
I fuckin 'knew it.
[Sighs]
It' s depressing.
You can' t trust 'em at all.
You took yourself out of the life.
And the minute you want a little of it back, she walks out on you.
It' s just like the saying says, you know?
- They are the fuckin 'rake.
- What the fuck are you talking about?
What saying?
I don' t know.
But there oughta be one.
- You know what cheers me up when I' m feelin 'shitty?
- What?
Rolled up aces over kings.
- That right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Stacks and towers of checks I can' t even see over.
- Where the sand turns to gold.
- Fuck it, let' s go.
- Don' t tease me.
- Let' s play some fuckin 'cards.
The poker room at the Mirage in Vegas... is the center of the poker universe.
The legends consider it their office.
Down here, the millionaires are scarce or they' re playing craps, but there' s still plenty of money for the taking.
Hey, hey, why don' t you warm up a seat for me.
- I got certain needs I gotta attend to, okay?
- I mean, I' m overdue.
- Good, man, hey, I was startin 'to wonder about you.
I thought, maybe, you know, the boys upstate brought about a few changes in you.
Hey, in your dreams, lover.
- Hey, Mikey!
- Hey, Mike.
This is beautiful.
- Ho!
Come all the way to Atlantic City just to see your mugs, huh?
Twice in one week.
This is what I like to see, huh?
Mike McDermott where he belongs... sittin 'with the scumbags.
Tellin 'jokes, draggin' the occasional pot.
Occasional?
Yeah, like my ex- wife occasionally went out with other men.
Forget her, Face.
I was actually gonna try and make some real money tonight.
But in honor of Mike' s alley- like return to the ring,
I' il sit with you all for a while.
Hey, don' t do us any favors, Knish.
You know, if we wanted to take each other' s rolls, we could have just stayed home.
[Mike Narrating]
These two have no idea... what they' re about to walk into.
Down here to have a good time, they figure... why not give poker a try?
After all, how different can it be from the home games... they' ve played their whole lives?
All the luck in the world isn' t gonna change things for these guys.
They' re simply overmatched.
We' re not playing together, but then again, we' re not playing against each other either.
It' s like the Nature Channel.
You don' t see piranhas eating each other, do you?
They wear their tells like signs around their necks.
Facial tics, nervous fingers.
A hand over a mouth.
The way a cigarette is smoked.
Little unconscious gestures that reveal the cards in their hands.
If a fish acts strong, he' s bluffing.
It' s that simple.
- How are you, you workaholics?
Good to see ya.
Glad you' re out.
Number' s changed, of course.
Lotta games this weekend, so you' re gonna need the number.
- Hey, Worm?
Zagosh, when you get yourself a job, then you can be my fuckin 'P. O.
I' m sorry, sir.
You can' t take chips from another player at the table.
We all know each other here.
We' re like friends, so if nobody complains, do you have a problem?
- Sir, you have to buy 'em from me.
- [Sighs]
Fuck this low- limit shit.
Can we go get something to eat?
I want to talk to you.
Don' t let that M. S. G. fuck up your head more than it is, Mikey.
It' s noble work you' re doing.
What' s with kitin 'my checks?
- I' m on empty, that' s why.
- You are?
You' re tapped again?
How much was the hooker?
- Mike, please.
- [Chuckles]
- It' s not where it went.
It went to Roman and Maurice?
I told you, man, you didn' t have to give it all back to 'em.
Take a little money for your time, you know?
Hey, that' s not where it went either.
- I ran into Grama tonight.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
He took everything I had.
You' re kiddin 'me.
Wait, who' s he working for?
Well, he' s sorta out on his own.
This fucker went around and bought up all my debt.
Grama.
That turncoat motherfucker.
Are you kiddin 'me?
I don' t know.
By his crazy fuckin 'gorilla math?
Like, 15.
- Fifteen?
Fifteen?
- Yeah, I mean...
- So, it' s just like...
- Why didn' t you tell me that, man?
Why did you not tell me that?
I could have paid that off.
- I had the...
- Hey!
I' m not a leech, all right?
We can help each other, like always.
That' s why we' re here.
That' s why we gotta get in the bigger game.
- Do you hear what I' m saying?
All right.
- Yeah?
- I mean, fuck that guy.
We' il figure something out.
How long should we wait?
Here he comes.
I' m so sorry I' m late.
Come to order in the matter of Slater v. New York State Higher Education Services.
The facts have been stipulated, the briefs have been read.
If that is convenient for you.
Yes, it is, and again, I' m sorry, ah, that I' m late.
Texas v. Johnson?
Um, well...
Mr. McDermott has been unreachable, so I' il take over, if it pleases the court.
Although not dispositive, the student body is more than 99 percent white.
Guys, what... what can I say?
I think I actually impressed Marinacci.
- Jo.
- What?
We' re not gonna talk?
You left me pretty quick there.
- You make it sound as if it was my decision.
- Well, it wasn' t mine.
I came home and you were gone.
You were just gonna drop me like that?
I learned it from you, Mike.
You always told me that this was the rule.
Throw in your cards the moment you know they can' t win.
- Look, this is our thing that we' re talking about.
It' s not some losing hand of poker.
I know exactly what we' re talking about, Mike.
Yeah.
[Scoffs]
[Announcer]
Eric Seidel cannot win this hand, and yet he doesn' t know it.
Chan is trying to sucker him in by taking his time.
Oh, look at that look of the defending champ.
And now Fifth Street, a six of diamonds.
No help.
Johnny Chan has a queen high straight.
Will Eric Seidel fall for the bait?
Yes, he' s going all in, and Chan has him.
Johnny Chan, the master...
- Yes, he' s going all in, and Chan has him.
- Hello.
It' s Petra.
Yeah, I' il buzz you in.
[Buzzing]
Well, that' s the important thing with the game of Hold 'Em.
- Hey.
- How you doing?
- [TV:
Man Continues Speaking]
Looks about the same.
- You want some scotch or something?
- No, I' m fine.
- Oh, '88 World Series, huh?
Johnny Chan.
Flops the nut straight and has the discipline to wait him out.
- [Announcer]
And yet he doesn' t know it.
- Johnny fucking Chan.
Look at that fuck.
He knows his man well enough to check it all the way... and risk winning nothing with those cards.
[Announcer]
Will Eric Seidel fall for the bait?
Yes, he' s going all in and Chan has him.
- Johnny Chan, the master.
- Poor Seidel.
Kid doesn' t know what hit him.
Yeah, I know what that feels like.
It' s like a locomotive running through your stomach.
You feel gut- shot.
Fuck it.
- Tomorrow' s a week.
- A week of what?
- Oh.
Worm.
- Yes, it' s kinda weird.
He' d just won eight grand.
Why go on the line behind another two?
So, he took, what, about eight off of Roman and Maurice?
Yeah, yeah, he comes in after you leave, sits for like another 20 more minutes, cashes out for the full amount.
Maurice hasn' t been back since.
I think he' s been playing across the street.
But, uh, Worm' s been around plenty.
He' s run you up just under seven grand.
Well, do me a favor and just put him on his own.
- Yeah?
I got a thou.
I just started coming back, so...
- Thanks for making it easy, Mike.
I' m sorry to be back over here for this reason.
I like being here.
It' s good to see you, Mike.
- I can stay.
I' il see you down at the club.
[Glass Shatters]
I know you' re in here.
I thought you were the janitor, man.
It' s a good thing Grama doesn' t know you as well as I do.
I' il play ya horse.
Fifty bucks a letter.
Yeah?
Don' t wing it.
Just step and throw.
Whoa, Jesus.
What happened?
You remember when we found this place, man?
Yeah, I remember when we found this place.
Yeah, now, see?
What did I ever do to that guy?
- You fucked his mother.
- [Laughing]
Yeah, but she was a good- Iooking older woman.
You gotta give me that.
You spent a year of your life hiding in this fucking gym from that sick fuck... until he pissed off the wrong guy and someone dropped a garbage can on his head.
What do you want me to say?
You were there too.
You were hiding from your troubles then.
I like to hide, and that' s part of the fun for me, you know?
I don' t like running solo.
It' s like I used to have a running partner, you know what I' m saying?
If we fucked up back then and got caught, the worst thing that was going to happen was maybe catch a beating, get expelled.
But, man, you' re fixing to go down hard, and it almost seems like you want to.
Stop worrying so much about me, okay?
No, no, you' re gonna get out of the way.
It' s gonna land on me.
I' il see ya.
Come on, Mike.
Come on, come on, come on.
I' m sorry, okay?
I' m sorry about the money.
It' s fucking embarrassing.
There' s been some reversals.
- Some reversals.
How much money do you have?
- Nine hundred.
I know, man.
I was really...
I was really up big.
I was cruising along.
I tried to beat that blackjack game at the Horseshoe Club in Brooklyn.
- That place is a mitt joint.
It was, like, ouch.
I got so good with this, I thought I could neutralize 'em.
- I know.
- That' s it.
I can' t go any deeper than that.
- And you gotta talk with Grama.
I' m not talking to that fucking Judas.
You think there' s any other way?
I know all the reasons I shouldn' t be here, but sometimes reasons don' t matter.
You see, no one' s ever stood up for Worm.
The guy' s been kicked around his whole life, from his father on down.
Maybe he' s not the same guy he was when he went away, but I can' t give up on him that easy.
I' m all he' s got.
Oh, what the hell.
- Hi, boys.
- Hi.
You cops?
You look like cops.
- We' re not cops.
- You wanna twirl then?
Jesus.
- You sure about this?
Just let me do the talking, all right?
Hey, Grama.
- Mike.
Hey, Worm.
It' s good you came.
That' s real smart thinking.
So, did you bring him along to help carry all my money?
Uh, there' s no money today.
There' s gotta be some money.
He' s not kidding.
You owe 25.
I' il take the rest in five days.
- Shh.
- [Dog Growling]
- You gotta catch 'em in the act.
[Dog Growling]
- [Whimpering, Thud]
- Christ.
- [Sighs]
In a week.
Grama, we want what you want.
We wanna square this thing.
But three days... three days is impossible.
All right?
Just think of this as a business decision.
Look, he just got out.
Let' s put him on a plan.
No, no, no, no, no.
This isn' t The Money Store.
We' re not negotiating here.
Well, then, I' m asking.
So, you' re looking for a little grace, Lester, some charity?
- It' s too late for him to shut up.
- Hey, listen!
He' s good for it.
- He' s good for it, Mike?
Then it' s on me too.
- Fifteen large, five days, or I start breaking things.
- I hear ya.
Get the fuck outta here.
Piece of shit.
Now, what the hell are you doing?
All I said is just keep your mouth shut for five seconds.
- Shit.
- Goddamn it.
I' m really sunk now.
No, 15 grand in five days.
I can do that.
Ah, under optimum conditions with a bankroll, maybe.
- But what have you got on you?
- Got, like, 350.
Ah, that' s 1, 200 between us.
We might as well play the fucking Lotto.
Listen.
You know, we might have a shot at this... if we sat together and just did our thing.
I' m not gonna do that.
I' m gonna do this straight up.
- Well, where do you wanna start?
- There' s a 30- 60 at the Chesterfield.
Come on, listen... there' s the 4: 00 a. m. in Woodside.
There' s the Greeks.
All right, there' s a union game in Jersey.
- There' s four.
- There' s a cigar shop in Brooklyn.
- It' s like an easy clean.
- There' s a golf pro game in Riverdale.
That' s six.
- You sure you' re up for this?
- I' m fucking up for this.
Well, let me look at you here.
You didn' t do it this time.
- [Woman]
I don' t know.
[Woman]
I kinda like this robusto.
A nice, nutty finish.
What do you got?
- Trip aces.
- Jacks.
- What did you think he had?
Does he look like a man beaten by jacks?
- Ah, fuck you.
- Fuck me?
[Man]
I bet.
Then let' s get some in there.
- Make it five.
- You' re raising me 300, kid?
I call your 300.
- How much is in there, Weitz?
- About 1, 500.
1, 500.
[Man]
Here' s a thousand.
There' s 500.
[Weitz]
Are you sure on that, Goldie?
You might want to leave a little something for your daughter' s riding lessons.
There' s a lot more where that came from, Weitz.
- [Laughing]
- [Worm]
Get up.
Come on.
Buy some real jewelry, you fucking cheap bastard.
- What were you doing in there?
- I didn' t have it.
You didn' t have it?
Since when you have to have it to take a pot off a hump like that?
- I was waiting the guy out.
I was gonna take him.
We don' t have time.
That guy was papier- mache.
The move was folding.
I can' t lose what I don' t put in the middle.
Oh, Jesus, you know what?
Well, what are we up to?
That' s like seven.
Seven.
Look at you.
One 64- hour session, and you need a nap.
- No time for a fucking nap.
- No, we don' t.
I know what you need.
[Man Singing In Italian]
Feel like I' m gonna get whacked sitting here like this.
We got 7, 300, Mike.
We gotta double that in two days.
Well, we' re gonna get close.
I' m sure if we come up a little short, Grama...
Grama will shoot us and bury us in a hole somewhere.
Now, I know this game up in Binghamton.
- In Binghamton?
- Yeah, yeah.
Two full tables.
All municipal workers.
It' s very fat.
Are you sure?
Binghamton' s five hours each way.
Well, look, I figure there' s 15 or 20 grand in that room, okay?
If we get even half of that, we' re home.
Lead me to it.
- Municipal workers, huh?
- What?
These guys work for the city.
They work for the state, you idiot.
Look, we' re here, okay?
- You got any better ideas?
- How the hell am I supposed to even get in this game?
This one guy, Pete Frye, I probably lost like ten grand over 18 months.
I mean, he thinks I' m a total fish.
He told me anytime I wanted a game when I got out, just look up his nephew.
You just go in there, you ask for Sean Frye, you' re in.
These guys are total suckers.
All right.
Give me, like, eight hours.
- Come back at 7: 00, 7: 30.
- What am I gonna do for eight hours?
I' il sit for a little while.
- No.
- No, not a chance.
- I' il sit at the other table and play straight.
You wanna play straight?
You go in there, I' il be back in eight hours.
Aw, Jesus.
I' il go find a fucking bowling alley.
[Chattering]
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I' m looking for Sean Frye.
Let' s go.
- Sean Frye?
- That' s right.
Yeah, your Uncle Pete told me to come by if I ever was around here.
You one of his students?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I wasn' t inside.
- You know him from hunting then, huh?
He took me for like a grand over at the lodge.
Well, that' s the buy- in here.
We play 20- 40 Stud.
- Grab a seat.
- How you doing?
I' m Mike.
- How you doing?
- [Chips Hit Table]
- You and me, Mike.
Another 40.
All right, 40 it is.
- Flush.
Generally, the rule is, the nicer the guy, the poorer the card player.
And these guys, despite being cops, are real sweethearts.
I' m right on schedule, up 4, 200.
- [Men Laughing]
[Worm]
Holy shit!
- [All]
Hey, Bear!
Met this guy down at the bowling alley.
Says he likes to play cards.
- This is Vitter.
Okay.
Give him some chips, start playing some cards.
[Chattering]
Everybody ante.
Let' s play some cards.
Ace high bets.
- Well, I like what I have.
The bet is 20.
I know that look.
I' m gonna fold.
Fold too.
- Yeah, everybody ready?
Fourth Street.
Raise you.
- I' m in.
Wow.
A lot of action.
A lot of action.
- I got the flush.
- Show me.
- Jesus.
Who wants more?
- I' m in.
- Come on, come on.
Okay?
Just to warn you.
Uh, ace checks.
- Check.
- Check on an ace.
All right.
I' il check.
- Check.
- Check.
Here we go.
- Easy.
What are you doing?
- Give me the deck.
- Relax, man.
- [Vitter]
A what?
What?
- What the hell' s going on over here, Stu?
- Caught a hanger, Sarge.
A hanger?
- Oh, God.
- To me?
- Seven of hearts.
- You boys professionals?
You working?
Let' s let the cards do the talking.
It' s three of a kind!
- Shut up!
One last thing, Stu.
- [Murmuring]
Aren' t you supposed to read us our rights?
Aw, Jesus!
Worm.
Hey.
Hey, you all right?
Yeah.
- [Groaning]
They took every fucking nickel.
I think I got 300 in my boot somewhere.
Oh, look at you.
Fuck!
Fuck, I cannot believe I caught a hanger.
- Aw, it' s never happened, I swear to God.
- Where' s the car?
- God, I think I cracked a rib.
- What the fuck were you thinking?
- I was trying to give us an edge.
- I had 'em.
I took a shot and I missed.
That happens.
- Fucking happens all the time around you.
- What, it doesn' t happen to you?
- Oh, hey, fuck you, man.
That was different.
- Why?
Why different, huh?
What makes you so fucking special?
What' s your ambition, man?
I don' t know.
What is it?
I don' t think like that.
No, I don' t think like you!
You always think you can beat the game straight up.
- I told you, I' m always gonna look for that edge.
Always.
We owe 15 grand in a day.
What do we do?
We get the fuck outta Dodge, all right?
We just steer clear of the city for a while.
We' il be up again in no time.
- You talk to Grama.
You get him to stake me.
- It' s not gonna work, okay?
We' re not dealing with Grama.
You said Grama' s on his own.
- You told me Grama' s on his own.
- KGB bankrolled him.
- So you' ve just fucked us right in the ass.
- Yeah, all the way, okay?
No fooling around.
It' s highway time.
Are you with me or not?
No, I' m not this time.
- Give me the keys.
- You' re really gonna go back there?
Yeah.
I' il see you when I see you.
At least you' re rounding again, right?
You' re gonna thank me for that someday.
[Engine Starts]
[Car Driving Away]
[Mike Narrating]
Call or raise the bet.
These are decisions you make at the table.
Sometimes the odds are stacked so clear, there' s only one way to play it.
Other times, like holding a small pair against two over cards, it' s six to five, or even money, either way.
Then it' s all about feel, what' s in your guts.
Well, look at you.
Look at me.
Come in.
No.
- Where' s your friend?
- Uh, he' s gone.
- He' s gone.
- So you brought my money?
- I' m a little short.
- How short?
There must be some kind of story.
Well... as you can see, I can' t pay you.
I see you' re banged up pretty good.
You never should' ve vouched for that scumbag.
Maybe not.
- You' re leaving me no outs here.
- Why?
I can' t trust you two aren' t playing me.
I' m not the one working with a partner here.
You wanna take it up with KGB, you go right ahead.
- Hey.
Hey, what' s up?
You look like Duane Bobick after one round with Norton.
- What the fuck happened to you?
- Ah, Worm.
When are you gonna listen?
I' m listening.
What do you need?
500?
I need 15, 000.
- Fifteen?
- Yep.
I need a blow job from Christy Turlington.
- Get the fuck outta here. $15, 000?
What can you do for me?
Five hundred dollars is not even gonna get me started.
Goddamn it, Mike, if 500 won' t help, what' s two grand gonna do?
What kind of trouble you in?
- KGB?
- Yep.
Come here.
Didn' t I tell you... to never let that guy get a hold of you?
- You told me a lot of things.
- Yeah, yeah.
And you don' t listen.
I tell you to play within your means, you risk your whole bankroll.
I tell you not to overextend yourself, to rebuild, you go into hock for more.
I was giving you a living, Mike, showing you the playbook I put together off my own beats.
That wasn' t enough for you...
This is one time I don' t need you to tell me how I fucked up.
I know I fucked up.
What I need from you is money.
- I need whatever money you can give me.
- See, that' s the thing.
This time there is no money.
A day?
No, I give it to you, I' m wasting it.
- That' s fucking great.
- You did it to yourself.
Yeah, I took a risk.
You see all the angles.
You never have the stones to play one.
"Stones"?
I' m not playing for the thrill of fucking victory here.
I owe rent, alimony, child support.
My kids eat.
I got stones enough not to chase cards, action... or fucking pipe dreams of winning the World Series on ESPN.
You want me to, uh, call some people, try and buy you some time, I will.
No problem.
I gotta say no.
That' s fine.
I understand.
- Hey, listen.
- What?
And you know what?
It wasn' t a bad beat.
I wasn' t unlucky.
I got outplayed that time.
But I know I' m good enough to sit at that table.
It' s not a fucking pipe dream.
I don' t doubt your talent.
I never...
I never told anybody this.
About eight, nine months ago, I' m at the Taj, it' s late, and I see Johnny Chan walk in.
And he goes, he sits 300- 600.
And the whole place stops when Johnny Chan walks in.
Everybody puts an eye on him.
'cause all the high rollers are over there watching him.
Some are playing with him, giving away their money to this guy to say...
And you know what I did?
I sat down.
Nah, you need 50, 60 grand to play right in that game.
Well, I had six, but I had to know.
What happened?
Played tight for an hour.
- Wired aces or kings?
- Rags.
I had nothing.
But he raised.
I' m just gonna outplay the guy.
I' m just gonna outplay this guy this hand.
- I re- raised.
- Re- raise.
- You played right back at him, huh?
And he just comes right back over the top of me, trying to bully me like I' m some fucking tourist.
I hesitate for two seconds.
And he makes a move toward his checks, and he looks at me.
And he looks at his cards, and he looks at me again.
And he mucked it.
I took it down.
"Did you have it?"
"I' m sorry, John.
I don' t remember. "
I got up, and I walked to the cashier.
I sat with the best in the world, and I won.
You put a fucking move on Chan, you son of a bitch.
So that' s why you made that run on KGB' s place.
And I' il do it again if I can.
Well, then I' m rooting for you, Mike.
I' il see you around, Knish.
This is temporary?
Will you be back next semester?
Oh, I think we both know I' m no lawyer.
I hope my story didn' t discourage you.
It inspired me.
I think I was on my way out anyway.
- But now you' re here.
- That' s right.
- You' re in trouble?
Uh, not with the law.
I owe.
- A gambling debt?
- Yeah.
It' s not mine.
I vouched for the wrong guy.
Um, so now it' s on me.
I understand.
So, what will it take for you to be free of this?
- I need 15, 000 tonight.
Michael!
- You know, I' m not a wealthy man, Michael.
I don' t have any other play here.
So, uh, if you can help me at all...
I hate to see you like this.
[Sighs]
If it must be tonight, then ten is the best I can do.
Would you do that?
When my mother let me leave the yeshiva, it nearly broke her.
But she knew...
She knew the life I had to lead.
To do that for another is a mitzvah.
And for that, I owe.
You hear me?
I know you can.
I promise that I' m gonna...
Good luck.
[Mike Narrating]
I' ve often seen these people, these squares, at the table.
Short- stacked and long odds against, all their outs gone, one last card in the deck that can help them.
I used to wonder how they could let themselves get into such bad shape... and how the hell they thought they could turn it around.
Just walking in here makes me queasy.
The fucking mopes at the tables.
I feel like Buckner walking back into Shea.
But what choice do I have?
So, you have my money?
- I owe you that money tomorrow, right?
So it' s still mine.
For the next eight hours, it is yours.
But if you don' t have it all by then, then you are mine.
I got $10, 000.
- You sure?
- You heard me.
Heads up.
We both start with a couple of racks.
Blinds, uh, 25 and 50?
And we don' t stop until one of us has it all.
[Cards Shuffling]
I' m gonna raise.
Thousand straight.
Very aggressive.
A new day.
And you won' t be pushed around.
I re- raise.
[Mike Narrating]
Doyle Brunson says, "The key to No- Limit... is to put a man to a decision for all his chips."
Teddy' s just done it.
He' s representing aces, the only hand better than my cowboys.
I can' t call and give him a chance to catch.
I can only fold, if I believe him.
I re- raise.
I' m all in.
In a heads- up match, the size of your stack is almost as important as the quality of your cards.
I chopped one of his legs out in the first hand.
- Now all I have to do is lean on him until he falls over.
- Check.
Bet a thousand.
Call.
Check.
What' s that, 2, 500 there?
Very good.
Good hand.
Catching that Jack on the turn.
- You got lucky there.
- Yep, it was luck.
So, that' s it then, hmm?
Just like a young man coming in for a quickie.
I feel so unsatisfied.
I' m sorry.
You must feel proud and good.
Strong enough to beat the world.
- I feel fine.
- Me too.
I feel okay.
'Course maybe we check with one other guy, see how he feels.
I thought I smelled him.
I' il take what' s ours.
'Course you could let it ride, Mike.
Take your chances.
You could let this happen, Grama?
He still has till morning to make good.
Uh, you know what?
I got my five grand here.
That' s just fine by me.
- I' m going home.
- Fine.
It' s a fucking joke anyway.
After all, I am paying you with your money.
- What did you say?
- Your money.
I am still up 20 grand... from this last time I stick it in you.
They' re trying to goad me, trying to own me.
It' s not about pride or ego.
It' s only about money.
I can leave now, even with Grama and KGB... and halfway to paying Petrovsky back.
That' s the safe play.
I told Worm you can' t lose what you don' t put in the middle.
- But you can' t win much either.
Checks!
- [Mike]
Double the blinds?
Table stakes.
Feel free to reload at any time.
[Speaking Russian]
Bad judgment.
But... don' t you worry, son.
It will all be over soon.
No check here.
I tap you.
I' m laying this down, Teddy.
Top two pair.
It' s a monster hand, and I' m gonna lay that down...
Lays down a monster.
Should have paid me off on that.
Why the fuck did you lay that down?
Wow.
Not hungry?
Let' s play some cards.
You spot a man' s tell, you don' t say a fucking word.
And usually I would' ve let him go on chewing those Oreos till he was dead broke.
But I don' t have that kind of time.
I' ve only got till morning.
Not even Teddy KGB' s immune to getting a little rattled.
Enough is enough, Teddy.
Finish the fucking kid off.
Hanging around.
Kid' s got alligator blood.
Can' t get rid of him.
No, I' m not going anywhere.
Double the blind.
I call.
Check.
Two grand.
I' il gamble.
You' re on a draw, Mike?
Go away.
This one is not good for you.
Okay.
[Sighs]
I' m gonna check, Teddy.
That' s right.
Big daddy... bets... the pot.
That' s 4, 400.
All right, I' m gonna call you, or else I won' t respect myself tomorrow morning.
Respect is all you' il have left in the morning.
Last card coming.
Check.
It hurts, doesn' t it?
You can' t believe what fell.
All your dreams... dashed.
Hopes down the fucking drain.
That ace could not have helped you.
[Chips Rattling]
I bet it all.
You' re right, Teddy.
The ace didn' t help me.
[Speaking Russian]
- Motherfucker!
That is it!
- [Grama]
That' s it?
Nyet!
No more!
No!
Not tonight!
He trapped me!
Well, you feeling satisfied now, Teddy?
Nyet!
He beat me.
Straight up.
Pay him.
Pay that man his money.
Turned my ten grand into just over 60.
Paid 15 to Grama, six went back to the Chesterfield.
As for Worm, well, I figure we' re even.
And after the ten going back to the professor,
Hey.
- You look like hell.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I' m okay.
You?
Now I am.
So, you' re outta here, huh?
Yeah, I' m...
I figure there' s nothing left for me here.
Listen, um, will you give this to Petrovsky?
I... didn' t want to wake him up.
It' s still a little early.
Can I count on you to do that?
You could always count on me, Mike.
Thanks.
Hey.
Call me.
If you need a lawyer.
I will.
And I will.

- I' m going to Vegas.
- Vegas, huh?
- Yeah.

Thank you!
Hey, Les.
You got a minute?
For you, Brad, I got five!
So, yeah, I' m sure you can understand our need to cut corners around here.
Times are tight.
You got to free up some cash.
- Exactly.
Like the time that Mr. Flournoy used the company MasterCard to pay for that hooker, and she used the card numbers and stayed at the St. Regis for, what was it, three months?
- That' s unsubstantiated gossip.
- That' s $50, 000.
That' s somebody' s salary.
Jesus!
I mean, calm down.
Nobody' s getting fired yet.
- [Scoffs]
- That' s why we' re having everyone... write out a job description mapping out in detaiI how they contribute.
And who' s expendable.
It' s just business.
I' ve been writing for this magazine for 14 years.
- You' ve been here how Iong?
- I' m one of the good guys, Les.
I' m trying to IeveI with you.
This is your one chance to save your job.

So, Janie, how was schooI?
It was okay.
Just okay?
No, Dad.
It was spectacular.
WeIl, you want to know how things went in my job today?
They' ve hired this efficiency expert, this reaIly friendly guy named Brad --
And he' s basicaIly there to make it seem they' re justified... in firing somebody, because they couldn' t just come out and say that, could they?
That would just be too honest.
You couldn' t possibly care Iess, could you?
What do you expect?
You can' t aII of a sudden be my best friend just because you had a bad day.

So stop acting Iike you' re goddamn Christy Turlington!
Cunt!
I am so sick of people taking their insecurities out on me.
- Oh, my God.
- Him?
Jane.
He' s a totaI Iunatic.
- Do you know him?
- Yeah.
We were on the same Iunch shift when I was in ninth grade, and he would always save the most random, weird things.
And then one day, he was just, Iike, gone.
And then Connie CarduIlo told me that his parents had to put him in a mentaI institution.
What did he do?
What do you mean?
WeIl, they can' t put you away just for saying weird things.
You totaI slut.
Please!
- You want to have, Iike, 10, 000 of his babies.
Hi.
My name' s Ricky.
I just moved next door to you.
I know.
I kind of remember this creepy incident where you were filming me Iast night?
- I didn' t mean to scare you.
- Thanks.
But I reaIly don' t need to have some psycho obsessing about me right now.
I' m not obsessing.
I' m just curious.
What a freak.
And why does he dress Iike a Bible salesman?
He' s, Iike, so confident.
That can' t be real.
I don' t believe him.
I mean, he didn' t even, Iike, Iook at me once. @@ [Bugle:
- How' d you get in the Army?
- Sergeant, I got three reasons for being in the Army.
And third, they nailed me.
- Bend aII the way down.
Here comes the BuII of the Woods.
What?
Oh.
I' m sorry.
- How would it Iook if I showed up with no one?
Now, Iisten to me.
This is an important business function.
As you know, my business is seIling an image, and part of my job is to Iive that image.
AII right.
Hi, Shirley!
Just do me a favor.
Act happy tonight.
I am happy, honey!
- You' re not -- Oh, that' s Buddy!
Good to see you again.
- It' s so good to see you too, Catherine.
- Carolyn.
Of course.
- Very weIl, thank you.
HeIlo, Christy.
- My husband, Lester.
- It' s a pleasure.
Oh, we' ve met before, actuaIly.
Christmas at the Sheraton.
Oh, yeah!
I wouldn' t remember me either.
Honey, don' t be weird.
I won' t be weird.
I' II be whatever you want me to be.
- We have a very healthy relationship.
WeIl, I don' t know about you guys, but I need a drink.
Put a Iittle more in there, cowboy.
Excuse me.
The house with the red door?
- I' m Ricky Fitts.
I just moved in the house next to you.
Hi, Ricky Fitts.
I' m Lester Burnham.
Hi, Lester Burnham.
- Do you party?
- Excuse me?
Do you get high?
You know, I probably wouldn' t even teII you this if I weren' t a Iittle tipsy, but...
I' m in complete awe of you.
I mean, your firm... is hands- down the RoIls- Royce of IocaI reaI estate firms, and your personaI sales record is -- [Clicks Tongue, Sighs]

You know, I suppose technicaIly I' m the competition, but I mean, hey, I don' t flatter myself... that I' m even in the same Ieague as you.
I don' t.
I' d love to.
- Absolutely.

Thank you.
Did you ever see that movie where the body is walking around... carrying its own head, and then the head goes down on that babe?

Re- Animator.
I' m not paying you to do whatever it is you' re doing out here.
So don' t pay me.
Excuse me?
I quit, so you don' t have to pay me.
Now Ieave me alone.
Asshole.
I think you just became my personaI hero.
Doesn' t that make you nervous, just quitting your job Iike that?
Eighteen.
I just do these gigs as a cover.
I have other sources of income.
But my dad interferes Iess in my Iife when I pretend... to be an upstanding young citizen with a respectable job.
Lester?
- What are you doing?
Ricky Fitts.
I' m Ricky Fitts.
I just moved into the house next to you.
I go to schooI with your daughter.
- With Jane?
- ReaIly?
I' m ready to go.
I' II meet you out front.
- [Chuckles]
Nice meeting you, Ricky.
Thanks for the thing.
Anytime.
Lester?
If you want any more, you know where I Iive.
They' re home.
Let' s go up to my room.
I should say hi to your dad.
I don' t want to be rude.
Nice suit.
You' re Iooking good, Mr. Burnham.
Last time I saw you, you Iooked kind of wound up.
Ooh, is that root beer?
I love root beer, don' t you?
- Hey.
- Hi.
Yes, of course.
I forgot to teII you.
Sorry about my dad.
I think it' s funny.
Yeah, to you he' s just another guy who wants to jump your bones.
But to me, he' s just... too embarrassing to Iive.
WeIl, your mom' s the one who' s embarrassing.
What a phony.
- But your dad' s actuaIly kind of cute.
He is.
- Shut up!
- Come on.
I bet he' s got a big dick.
[Jane Laughing]
If he built up his chest and arms, I would totaIly fuck him. - @ La, Ia, Ia, Ia, Ia, Ia @ - I would.
I would suck your dad' s big fat dick, and then I' d fuck him untiI his eyes roIled back in his head.
What was that noise?
- I swear I heard something.
That was the sound of you being a huge, disgusting pig.
- [Rattling]
See?
- What is it?
It' s that psycho next door.
Jane, what if he worships you?
What if he' s got a shrine with pictures of you surrounded by dead people' s heads and stuff?
I bet he' s filming us right now.
ReaIly?
Welcome to America' s Weirdest Home Videos.
Coming, Dad.
You know I don' t Iike Iocked doors in my house, boy.
I must' ve Iocked it by accident.
So what' s up?
I -- I need a urine sample.
It' s been six months already.
Yeah.
I suppose.
Y- You know --
WeIl, good night, son.
I' ve been waiting for you.
You' ve been working out, haven' t you?
I can teIl.
I was hoping you could give me a bath.
I' m very, very dirty.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
- You were masturbating.
I was not.
Yes, you were.
So shoot me.
I was whacking off.
I was choking the bishop, chafing the carrot.
You know, saying "hi" to my monster.
That' s disgusting.
WeIl, excuse me, but some of us stiII have blood pumping through our veins.
- ReaIly?
WeIl, I' m the only one who seems to be doing anything about it.
Lester, I refuse to Iive Iike this!
This is not a marriage.
This hasn' t been a marriage for years, but you were happy as Iong as I kept my mouth shut.
And the new me whacks off when he feels horny...
'cause you' re obviously not going to help me out in that department.
You think you' re the only one who' s sexuaIly frustrated.
I' m not?
I' m ready.
I wiII divorce you so fast, it' II make your head spin.
On what grounds?
I don' t fuck other women.
I' ve never hit you.
I don' t even try to touch you, since you made it so abundantly clear... just how unnecessary you consider me to be!
I did support you when you got your Iicense.
And some people might think that entitles me to half of what' s yours.
So, turn out the Iight when you come back to bed, okay?
It' s a great thing when you realize you stiII have... the ability to surprise yourself.
Makes you wonder what else you can do that you' ve forgotten about.
Hey, guys.
I didn' t know you ran.
- I just started.
- Good for you.
I figured you guys might be able to give me some pointers.
I need to shape up, fast.
Are you Iooking to just Iose weight, or do you want to have... increased strength and flexibility as weII?
I -- I want to Iook good naked.
Oh, what is this?
Fuckin 'gay pride parade?
My entire Iife is passing before my eyes, and those two have barely broken a sweat.
Sorry.
Lester Burnham.
We haven' t met.
Oh, whoa.
Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.
I was thinking about the, uh -- I was gonna -- The movie we talked about.
- Yeah!
You want to borrow it?
It' s up in my room.
Come on.
- Can you hold this for a sec?
I don' t think my dad would try to come in while someone else is here, but you never know.
- What is this?
- Urine.
I have to take a drug test every six months just to make sure I' m clean.
You just smoked with me Iast night.
It' s not mine.
One of my clients is a nurse in a pediatrician' s office.
Cut her a deal, she keeps me in clean piss.
You Iike Pink Floyd?
I Iike a Iot of music.
Man, I haven' t Iistened to this album in years.
How much do you want?
It' s been a while.
Um, how much is an ounce?
This is totaIly decent, and it' s 300.
This shit is top of the Iine.
It' s caIled G- 13.
It' s geneticaIly engineered by the U. S. government.
No paranoia.
Is that what we smoked Iast night?
This is aII I ever smoke.
- How much?
- Two grand.
Jesus!
Things have changed since 1973.
I know you' re good for it.
- Thanks.
There' s a card in there with my beeper number.
Beep me anytime, day or night.
And I only accept cash.
Now I know how you can afford aII this equipment.
When I was your age, I flipped burgers aII summer just to buy an eight- track.

WeIl, you obviously have no interest in saving yourself.
Brad, for 14 years, I' ve been a whore for the advertising industry.
The only way I could save myself now is if I start firebombing.
Management wants you gone by the end of the day.
Just what sort of severance package is management prepared to offer me, considering the information I have about our editoriaI director... buying pussy with company money?
Which I think would interest the I. R. S., since it technicaIly constitutes fraud.
And I' m sure that some of our advertisers and rivaI publications... might Iike to know about it as weIl, not to mention...
Craig' s wife.
- What do you want?
- One year' s salary with benefits.
That' s not going to happen.
What do you say I throw in a Iittle sexuaI harassment charge to boot?
Against who?
Against you.
Can you prove that you didn' t offer to save my job... if I Iet you blow me?
Man... you are one twisted fuck.
I' m just an ordinary guy... with nothing to Iose.
- Oh.
Christy Ieft for New York this morning.
Let' s just say things were a Iittle... hectic around the house.
- What' s she doing in New York?
- She' s moving there.
Buddy.
I' m so sorry.
According to her, I' m... too focused on my career.
[Chuckling]
Ha.
- Mm- hmm.
When I saw you two at the party the other night, you seemed perfectly happy.
WeIl, caII me crazy, but it is my philosophy that in order to be successful, one must project an image of success... at aII times.
What are you doing?
- I was filming this dead bird.
Because it' s beautiful.
[Ricky]
Hi, Jane.
I want you to stop filming me.
WeIl, whatever.
This is boring.
Let' s go.
- Are you crazy?
I don' t want to end up hacked to pieces in a Dumpster somewhere.
It' s okay.
But thanks.
Let' s go.
- Come on, Jane.
- I think I' m going to walk too.
What?

I have fast food experience.
Yeah, Iike 20 years ago.
I' m sure there' ve been amazing technologicaI advances in the industry, but surely you must have some sort of training program.
It seems unfair to presume I won' t be able to Iearn.

the "royaI treatment," so to speak.
I was so stressed out.

And then she cut down their tree.
Is that a funeraI?
Have you ever known anybody who died?
Have you?
No.
But I did see this homeless woman who froze to death once... just Iaying there on the sidewalk.
She Iooked reaIly sad.
I got that homeless woman on videotape.
Why would you film that?
- Because it was amazing.
- What' s amazing about it?

One of my clients is a Iocksmith.
He was short on cash one night, so I Iet him pay me in trade.
Turn it over.
Oh, my God.

There' s a whole subculture of people who coIlect this Nazi shit.
But my dad just has this one thing.
- What' s wrong?

No, I' m not.
You want to see the most beautifuI thing I' ve ever filmed?
It was one of those days... where it' s a minute away from snowing, and there was this electricity in the air.
You can almost hear it.
Right?
And this bag was just... dancing with me,
Iike a Iittle kid begging me to play with it, for 15 minutes.
That' s the day I realized that there was this... entire Iife behind things...
and this incredibly benevolent force... that wanted me to know that there was no reason to be afraid... ever.
Video' s a poor excuse, I know, but it helps me remember.
I need to remember.

Then I told my boss to go fuck himself, and then I blackmailed him for almost $60, 000.
- Pass the asparagus.
- Your father seems to think... this kind of behavior is something to be proud of.
And your mother seems to prefer that I go through Iife Iike a fucking prisoner... while she keeps my dick in a Mason jar under the sink.

Your wife is with another man, and... you don' t care?
Nope.
Our marriage is just for show.

- What do you mean?
I mean, how' s her Iife?
Is she happy?
Is she miserable?
I' d reaIly Iike to know, and she' d die before she' d ever teII me about it.
She' s reaIly happy.
She thinks she' s in Iove.
Good for her.
How are you?
It' s been a Iong time since anybody asked me that.
I' m great.
I' ve gotta go to the bathroom.
I' m great.
Man, oh man.
Oh, my God.
I had always heard your entire Iife flashes... in front of your eyes the second before you die.
First of aIl, that one second... isn' t a second at aIl.
Iike an ocean of time.
For me, it was Iying on my back... at Boy Scout camp, watching faIling stars.
And yeIlow Ieaves from the maple trees... that Iined our street.
Or my grandmother' s hands and the way her skin... seemed Iike paper.
And the first time I saw my cousin Tony' s... brand- new Firebird.
And Janie.
And Janie.
Carolyn.
I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me, but it' s hard to stay mad when there' s so much beauty in the world.
Sometimes I feeI Iike I' m seeing it aII at once and it' s too much.
My heart fiIls up Iike a baIloon that' s about to burst.
And then I remember to relax... and stop trying to hold on to it.
And then it flows through me Iike rain, and I can' t feeI anything but gratitude... for every single moment... of my stupid Iittle Iife.
You have no idea what I' m talking about, I' m sure.
But don' t worry.
You wiII someday.
Are you sitting comfortably?
Then I will begin.
This story started many thousand of years ago.
But it was all over in just 7 days.
All that long long time ago, none of the things we can see now.
The sun, the moon, the stars, the earth, animals and plants.
Not a single one existed.
Only God existed.
So only he could create.
I imagine he has dead like all the rest.
Ahh... those were the days...
Mr Toltle your hair.
Good morning, madam.
We' ve come about to...
Oh yes, of course...
Come in.
I wasn' t expecting you were so soon.
You are...?
I am Bother Smiths, madam.
And this is Admond Toltle.
Please to meet you madam.
You must be the gardener.
That' s right, the gardener.
And this young lady called Lydia.
Does she has must experiences in service?
Don' t let her angle face fool you, madam.
She is older than she looks.
Can you iron?
What' s the matter?
She can' t talk, madam Poor little mice of mute.
But she is good little worker, I can promise you that.
Alright, the other girl I hadn' t spoke to her much anyway.
Follow me, Mrs. Smiths, you and the girl sleep at upstairs.
Mr.?
Toltle, madam.
Yes, Toltle. You can sleep in the shed around the back.
This house has been neglected since servants disappeared almost a week ago.
Yep.
They didn' t collect the wages.
They just left then
What a strange thing to do!
This house is not an ideal home.
As in my advertisement requesting... honest, hardworking people.
There' s nobody more hardworking than us, isn' t that right, Mr. Toltle?
Well, I will be honest... and very hardworking.
The kitchen. l have breakfast at eight.
The children at nine.
Lunch is set at one, and dinner at half past seven.
The master, madam?
The master was killed in the war.
A year and a half ago.
Which of you does the cooking?
I am so sorry, madam.
Which of you does the cooking?
You will notice what I' m doin '.
ln this house, No door must be open without previous one being closed first.
It is vital that you remember this.
It' s not as easy as it may seen.
There are 15 different keys for of the 50 doors.
Mrs. Smiths... From tomorrow onwards, I' il leaving the keys and you' re in- charge.
Yes. madam.
The music room, that old piano was already here when we moved in.
Please do not let the children thumb on it.
Silence is something that we pride very highly in this house.
You' il not find a telephone, a radio or anything that makes a sound.
We don' t have electricity either.
Let' s continue...
That' s no need to show us around the whole house.
Yes!
Yes, there is.
Cause here, most of the time you can hardly see your way.
It' s often difficult to look up a table, a chair, a door, a side board.
What do you mean, madam?
Perhaps I should introduce you the children.
Mr. Toltle, you can go to the garden now.
- Yes, madam.
And you can start closing the curtain.
Come.
I will wake them, and you wait here.
Whatever you do, don' t open the curtain.
They' re still half asleep.
Sweet little children.
Well, what do you say?
How do you do?
How do you do?
How do you do, children?
My name is Mrs. Smiths.
But you can call me Bother, if you like. What are your names?
Ann.
- Nicholas.
Ann and Nicholas.
What you goin' to be our new nanny?
I' m your new nanny.
It' s time for the breakfast. Lydia, go to the kitchen and close every curtain.
About what?
Their condition.
The children have a very serious allergy to light.
They have never been exposed to any light much stronger than this.
Otherwise, in a matter of minutes they will break up in souls.
And begin to suffocated and will eventually to fatal. // - My God!
I don' t like this toast.
- Why not?
It tastes funny. l like it better before.
That is because before, somebody else made it.
When are they comin 'back?
They' re not comin 'back, child.
Just like daddy.
Daddy is comin 'back, though. Mrs. Smiths, our father is fighting in the war in France.
It' s the World War.
I know, but he' s in France.
Are you goin 'to leave us too?
Of course not.
Why should I leave you?
They did.
And when it happened...
What do you mean, Ann?
What' d happened?
Mummy went mad.
- Yes, it did.
- Yes it did!
What' s goin 'on?
I want to see those plates empty in less than a minute, is that clear?
Mrs. Smiths, would you come outside for a moment? l have word with you.
Yes, madam.
The postman usually comes every Wednesday.
ln this week, he hasn' t.
I' m afraid I don' t follow, madam.
Since it never published, would you mind explain to me what you' re doin 'here?
Oh, I understand...
The truth is, we just came by to ask for a chance.
You know, because like this will need someone who knows the rules.
You mean, you' ve served in a house like this one before.
We in fact, just worked here.
Here?
It was a few years ago.
lf you don' t mind I' m saying so, madam, it was the best years of my life.
Because this house... mean a lot to us.
No, no... no...
Don' t bother this, no need.
Like the back of my hand.
Well, still assuming that the wall hasn' t been moved in the meantime.
Nothing here is moved except the light.
But it changes everything.
Yes, madam.
I don' t like fantasy. Strange ideas, do you know what I mean?
I think so, madam...
My children sometimes have strange ideas.
But you mustn' t paying attention to them. Children will be children.
Alright, you can stay.
Thank you very much, madam.
What do you find so amusing?
Well...
- What?
Those children were really stupid.
- Why?
Because they only believe in Jesus, and then they get killed for it.
And what would you gonna to do, deny Christ?
Yes. lnside I would have believed in him.
But I wouldn' t told the Roman.
ls that what you think too, Nicholas?
I see. So you both would have lie to the point to denying Christ.
ln the next life?
The one is waiting for us after we die,
Where if you have gone?
Where, Nicholas?
To the Limbo.
What is the children Limbo?
One of the four hell.
Which are?
Me... me... me...
Let him answer.
At the centre of the earth. where it is very very hot.
That' s where children goes, they' re liar, they don' t go there just for a few days.
They are the damned... forever.
Think about it.
Try to imagine. The end of eternity.
Close your eyes and try to imagine.
Forever.
I' m getting dizzy.
Now, do you understand justice above the truth.
Alright, read lesson six.
- Can we go and play?
You most certainly can not and you' re gonna to learn it by heart.
Because you' re goin 'to read the lesson, - All of it?
And anymore protesting, there' il be no playing for today.
ln fact, maybe you can study inside the room.
No, no, no!
- Yes, yes, yes...
You get scare?
You don' t get use to the house by now.
What if we see a ghost?
Has your sister been telling you one of the story?
I haven' t told him anything.
When you see a ghost, you say hello and you continue study
Ann, come with me to the music room.
- Why me?
Take your book.
Nicholas, I want to see that lesson // learn less than a hour.
Give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss.
Ann, wait for me outside.
You know I can' t.
Mrs. Smiths, close the curtain.
My daughter is going the living room.
Yes, madam.
Alright.
Darling.
Mummy can' t be with you all the time.
You must learn to be on your own.
Whenever you' re afraid, I want you to squeeze it.
Say "Our Father", then your fear will go away.
It won' t.
- Yes, yes, it will.
Don' t you see that when you do that,
There is no reason to be afraid.
Do you have any children?
No, Mr Toltle and Lydia are all I' ve got and I' m all they got.
Was she born like that?
I don' t remember.
Was she born a mute?
No.
I' ve finish work here.
You excuse me, I' il see Mr. Toltle to give him hand.
Nicholas!
Nicholas, I' m coming.
Why are you crying?
- I wasn' t crying, I was reading!
But, I just heard you...
Ann!
Are you alright?
- Yes!
Why were you crying?
- I wasn' t crying.
But I just heard you a moment ago.
There is no need to feel ashame.
I don' t! lf I' ve been crying, I will tell you.
So, I imagined it, did l?
No, it' s was that boy.
What boy?
- Victor,
Who' s Victor?
The boy that was here a moment ago.
But he wouldn' t stop crying.
I think he is a spoilt brag.
He said that we have to leave the house.
Did he now?
Why was he crying?
Because he doesn' t like this house, but he has to live here.
His father is a pianist...
His father is a pianist, is he?
I have already told him that he is not allow to touch the piano.
So, you' ve spoken to his father as well?
No, only with Victor. His father is at the entrance // of the hall.
But I' ve just come from the hall, and there is no one there.
They must have gone upstairs.
That' s enough.
Now why are you crying?
That was Victor.
- So where is he now?
He went out through there.
Tell me, how a boy can get in and out this room with this lock?
I thought I made myself quite clear.
No door is to be open without the previous one being close. ls that so hard to understand?
This house is like a ship, the light must be in contain by opening and closing the doors.
My children' s life are so important.
But madam, I...
- Don' t argue with me, quiet!
Now, which one of you was the last to enter that room? Lydia?
She hasn' t got the key, I' ve already told you that.
Well, that leave you then.
You saw me with your own eyes.
I hope you' re not suggesting it was me?
Do you think I' il endanger the life of my own daughter?
You' re not suppose to read at that table.
You are gonna to tell mummy?
Or perhaps you?
Did you really see a boy?
Yes, he is called Victor.
ls he a ghost?
Don' t be stupid, ghosts aren' t like that.
What are they like?
How do you know?
Because I' ve seen them.
They come out at night.
Where?
Well, I don' t believe you saw that boy.
Believe what you like, you soon will begging us to play with you.
Nicholas.
- Look!
Why have you opened the curtains?
- It wasn' t me.
Who was then? lt was Victor.
He' s been doing it all night.
You' re lying, I' m gonna to tell mummy.
So, I am a liar, am l?
My stupid brother wants to see you.
Leave me alone.
So, you don' t want to see him now?
You' re a cowdy custard.
I will just have to do it myself then.
Stop it, get out of my bed, both of you.
This is our bed.
No, it' s mine.
Ann, please don' t put on that voice.
You be quiet, cowdy custard.
And you don' t know my parents.
Ann, I' m goin 'to tell mummy about you.
Don' t be stupid.
Mummy, help!
What is it?
She was frighting me, I told her to be quiet...
I' m fed up with you!
I didn' t do anything!
There, I' ve finished.
Very good.
Now, you can ask for forgiveness.
That was not we have agreed.
Today you will be punish, and you will do as I say.
How dare you.
Mummy, I won' t ask forgiveness for something that I didn' t do.
You told your brother there was someone else in the room. - There was.
You' re lying!
Ann, do you remember the story about justice?
Children who don' t tell the truth ends up in Limbo.
I' ve read the other day that' s for children who haven' t been baptised.
And I have.
Did you look in on Nicholas?
Yes madam, the little angel is fast asleep.
She still on the stairs?
Yes, madam.
How long the punishment is going on?
It has been three days now.
It' s up to her.
She has to swallow her pride and ask for forgiveness.
Anyway, it' s about time she started to read the bible.
The priest will be very pleased to hear about that,
He know perfectly well, the children can' t go out.
He told me yesterday he' il be by us soon as possible.
I' ve beginning to feel totally cut off from the world.
That' s true, madam.
Ann, I can' t hear you.
lncidently, Mrs. Smiths, I have to put out the noise of Lydia,
She' d been doing it back and forward.
Would you tell her it' s not necessary to get around just to do cleaning?
I couldn' t bear to take another migraine attack.
I' il tell her.
- Thank you.
Nothing, mummy.
I' m just reading like you' ve told me.
Did you hear that as well?
Hear what?
What was that?
- I don' t know.
Ann, tell me who' s making that noise.
- You tell me.
I' ve told you there was someone in the room And you punished me
Honey, I want the truth.
Tell me if there is someone upstair.
There, in that junk room.
Mummy, you' re letting the light in.
Where did they go?
- They just came pass here.
Which way did they go?
Over there, over there.
They are everywhere.
They said this house is their.
And they said they will take the curtain down as well.
Madam, stay calm please.
I would not stay calm.
Madam, this is a very old house The floor is squeezed from the foaming plan.
There were voices, I am telling you.
Mummy, mummy, look.
I did it yesterday.
This is the father, this is the mother. this is Victor This is the old woman.
What is this number stand for?
That is the number of times...
I see the old woman the most.
Oh my God and heaven!
Mrs. Smiths, go to call Mr. Toltle.
We' ve to search the house immediately.
It' s alright, mummy' s here.
Even she is not looking at you, but she can see you.
She' s always around said "Come with me".
Ann, don' t lie to me!
Honestly, mummy. And she asked me things Victor told me she' s a witch.
What did she ask you?
- Things.
We have to open all the curtains.
You both search the right side...
Then we' il search upstairs.
Ann, why do you makeup such story?
I read them in books.
Well you shouldn' t believe everything that you read in books.
That' s what our mother said She says about the ghost are rubbish.
And then, she expect us to believe that everything we read in the bible.
Don' t you believe it?
Believe something I don' t believe God makes the world in seven days.
I don' t believe that Normans got all the animal into one boat.
No, I don' t believe that either.
Have you mentioned any of this to your mother?
Madam.
- Yes?
We' ve searched everywhere There is no one.
I see.
Mrs. Smiths.
Yes, madam.
Do you have any idea what this might be?
Look.
They are all asleep.
They' re not asleep, madam.
They are dead.
This is the book of Death.
ln the last century, I believe they take photographs of the death.
ln the hopes, their souls will go on living. Oh, and children.
How can these people be so superstitious?
Grateful to the people that can lead them to do strange things.
Get rid of it.
I don' t want it in the house. - Yes, madam.
Mrs Smiths, why don' t you come and sit by the fire?
Warmer...
Do you have to take care of the children as well?
So, I was in charge of the organising... the houseworks.
Oh!
About Fifteen.
ln the end, there were just three of us left. - Why?
My employers moved to London.
My family left at the summer of 1940.
That was the last time I' ve heard from them.
Was that when Lydia went dumb?
Yes, I think so. You know my memory is little lost, madam.
What happen to her?
Suddenly one day, she just stop talking.
There must be a reason.
People don' t just stop talking.
Something must have happened to her.
Did your employers treat you well?
They are always very kind to us.
They treated us just like family.
You know, madam.
I think I will go to bed.
You go.
I will stay here a while longer.
I shouted at you.
Can you forgive me?
Mummy.
When is daddy comin 'home?
- When the war is over.
And because he wasn' t prepare to let the German tell him what he had to do.
Mrs. Smiths!
Give me the keys, hurry up!
What' s happening?
Oh my God!
I' ve checked that room myself.
It was empty.
Take this tablets, madam.
And yet, I found there was someone downstair.
And it wasn' t human.
There is something in this house.
Something which is not like... at rest.
You don' t believe it, do you?
I don' t blame you.
I used to not believe in these things.
I do believe it, madam.
I' ve always believe in those things.
But that is not easy to explain.
But, they do happen. We all heard stories from beyond now and then.
the world of the death is mix up with the world of the living.
But it' s impossible. The Lord will not allow such a thing like living with the death.
That will only mean only the eternity.
It say so in the bible.
There isn' t always an answer for everything.
Where are you off to, madam?
I' m goin 'to the village to find the Father.
lf he won' t come here, then I' d go to him.
You should wait for the weather in full. - I have waited long enough.
Madam.
I don' t care what he has told you, tell me.
He must come today.
What are you gonna to tell him?
To search every room inch by inch.
It' s still very early.
Mr. Toltle.
- Good morning, madam.
I need you to search the whole garden for grave stone. - Grave stone?
When my husband bought this house he said there was a cemetary.
I' m not seeing anything!
Take care, that could be overgrowth.
I need to know it there was a family buried here.
Now she thinks the house is haunted.
Do you think it' s safe to let her go?
The fog wouldn' t let her go very far.
The fog.
The fog, of course.
When do you think we should bring this out into the open?
All in good time, all in good time.
Speaking of which...
Charles!
Grace.
Oh!
Oh! lt can' t be true, it can' t be true.
They said you are dead.
They said a lot of things.
Thank you God.
Every night I pray for this, begging God to bring you back.
Out there, looking for my home.
Sometimes I bleed...
Mrs. Smiths.
This is my husband.
I am very pleased to meet you, sir.
I want you to prepare hot water and some clean clothes and something to eat.
Right away, madam.
Hello, my little ones?
Daddy!
Why did you take so long?
Hello, Nicholas.
I told you, see, I told you he will come back.
Have you both been well behaved?
We' ve been very good.
Have you been good to your mother?
Very good.
Daddy, did you kill anyone?
Here he comes.
Darling, we' ve prepared lunch for you.
Are you comin 'down or you prefer...?
When is daddy comin 'down?
Daddy is very tired.
He said he saw a lots of dead man.
Mummy, when people died in the war, where do they go?
What a question...
On what?
On the good ease or bad ease.
Your father is from good ease.
How do you know who is the good or bad are?
Eat your food.
You' il never go to war.
We' il never go anywhere.
You' re much better at home...
With your mummy and daddy who love you very very much.
And the intruder?
There are no intruders here?
But you said that there was?
No, there' re no intruders here, I don' t want to hear another word.
But, you said...
- That is enough!
- No!
Why not?
- Because you can' t.
Ann, stop breathing like that.
Stop it!
Stop breathing!
Right, you go to your room.
There' s no dessert for you today.
Oh!
Look what an awful face you' ve got.
- Alright... care, care.
Listen to me, I have seen them too.
Who?
- Yes.
Then, why don' t you tell mother?
I think your mother doesn' t want to hear.
She only believe what she was taught.
Don' t worry, she' il see them someday.
Then everything will be different.
How?
You' il see.
There are goin 'to be some big surprises.
There' re are going to be changes.
- Changes?
Now she is behaving as nothing has happened.
What about her daughter?
She is not so stubborn.
She is much more easier to convince.
It' s her mother who' s gonna cause us problems.
Do you think her husband suspect anything?
No, I don' t think he even knows where he is.
What a pretty daughter I' ve got.
Mummy made this especially for you.
I look like a bride.
You do.
You can take it off now.
Ann, this dress has to be spotlessly of keeping it.
I promise I wouldn' t dirty it.
Just let me wear a little longer.
Alright, I' il be back shortly.
No sitting on the floor, no leaning against the wall.
Miss, would you like to dance?
Yes, I will love to.
You must eat something.
Ann, you need to take the dress off now?
Ann, are you listening to me?
What did I tell you about sitting on the floor?
Why can' t you ever...
What' s the matter?
Where is my daughter?
Are you mad?
I am your daughter.
No, no, you are not my daughter!
Madam, I heard shout.
She wants to kill me, She won' t stop until she kills us.
Alright, come with me.
You wicked!
How is she?
I lefted her with her father.
She insists speaking to him.
What happened?
Why did you fight?
It' s the old woman with strange eyes.
She was imitating my daughter' s voice.
I swear to God it wasn' t my daughter.
God help me, what' s the matter with me.
I don' t know what' s the matter with me.
You must get more rest.
We know what has to be done.
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean what has to be done.
Nothing... madam, I was just suggesting...
There' s nothing to suggest.
You have no idea
What is this?
Tablets for your migraine.
What you always take.
Please, I need to be on my own.
- Yes, madam.
Ann told me everything.
Even thought there was ghost.
I' m not talkin 'about the ghost.
I' m talking about what happened that day.
I don' t know what are you talkin 'about?
Tell me what happened.
Ahh!
I don' t know what happened to me...
The servants left during the night.
I couldn' t leave the house!
Ann, Ann, what happened?
She hit me.
She went mad that day.
Do you remember?
Please give me chance.
The children?
They know that I love them. They know I never hurt them. l' il die first.
What do you want to do?
I came back to say goodbye to my wife and children.
Now, I must go.
Go where?
To the front.
- I thought it was over.
The war is not over.
What are you talking about?
You' re not going.
You left us once already.
Why do you go to that stupid war that nothing to do with us.
Why couldn' t you have stayed like the others stayed?
To surrender?
We all surrendered.
The whole life it was occupied.
What did you expect?
What are you trying to prove... by goin 'to war? Your place was here with us.
Don' t you remember?
Remember what you' ve told me?
I know a house.
No one will bother our children.
And then you left...
It wasn' t just the war.
You wanted to leave me, don' t you?
Mrs. Smiths!
Are you alright?
You alright?
I want my daddy.
Daddy' s gone.
- It' s not true.
Yes, it is.
It is true.
I love you, mummy.
Who was it?
Tell me, tell me!
You know because it happened to you too, tell me.
Don' t scare her.
Where are they?
- What?
The curtains that my children depends on.
I have noticed, madam!
There' s no need to raise your voice.
Oh!
Mr. Toltle, I was just on the point to calling you.
Do you know that someone has taken all the curtains?
Curtains? Oh dear!
Why should anyone take the curtains?
Let some daylight into this house, I imagine.
Day light?
Of course.
Someone wants to kill my children.
Why do you think that the day light will kill them?
Are you mad?
This will kill them.
Yes, but that was before.
The condition could have clear up by itself.
lf you' re not expose them to day light, how do you know that will kill them?
One fine day, they disappeared.
I' m goin 'to find curtains.
When you finish helping me, you' il leave this house.
What about master?
What' s he goin 'to say about all of this?
Give me your keys, I want your keys now.
You want to frighten us.
You want to take over this house.
Now, you give me those keys.
I would not ask again.
You know calm down.
Give me the keys.
Give it to me!
Now get out of here.
I think I' ve reached what I wanted.
How about you?
Definitely.
We better go and uncover the grave stone.
What' s mummy doin '?
I already told you, she' d gone mad.
- Lair!
- Liar.
- Liar!
Night!
Where are you goin '?
I have had enough. l' m goin 'to the woods, to look for daddy.
I' il hang on to the pipe into the ground.
It' s very easy.
lf mummy finds out, you' il end for it.
Wait, I want to look for daddy too.
Liar, you just don' t want to be left alone.
Be quiet!
Ann, I think we got lost.
We haven' t left the garden yet, silly.
I am scared.
- You should' t have come then.
Say something.
- What should I say?
I don' t know.
I' m walking and my name is Ann...
What is that over there?
I think they are graves.
Don' t go near.
- Why not?
What if ghost jumps out?
Only skeletons.
- Let' s go.
Wait!
Ann, what does it say?
Must be strong now, children.
Nicholas, come here.
Mrs. Smiths, please don' t tell that we ran away.
Don' t speak to them.
They' re dead!
- What?
Come here!
lf they are ghost, why aren' t they...
Get away from them!
I am sick of it.
I' m telling you the truth.
Come here!
Children!
Run!
Run!
Don' t come any closer!
Don' t move!
There no used finish us off.
All have done Century ago.
Go away!
Please.
What do you want?
Don' t open the door.
I' ve seen their graves.
Go sit and hide.
I am scared.
Go!
We' ve trying to make you understand.
About the new situation.
What situation?
We must all learn to live together.
lf you are dead, leave us in peace.
ln here, get inside.
I suppose if we leave you, you think they will?
Who?
- The intruders.
lntruders?
They took the curtains down, I am sure it was them.
Now they are in there with you and your children.
Waiting for you.
- No!
Yes, and believe me.
Sooner or later they will find you.
I' il be back in a minute.
No, mummy said we shouldn' t be separated.
I can' t leave her on her own...
Stop breathing like that.
Stop breathing like that.
Can' t you hear it.
Someone there?
Come with us, children.
Come with us.
Nicholas?
Where are you?
lntruders have found them.
There' s nothin 'we can do now.
You' il have to go upstair and talk to them.
Oh father.
God in heaven, help me.
Why are you afraid, children?
Why don' t you want to be friends?
Come on, speak to me.
Tell me, what happen?
Don' t tell her.
Don' t tell her, Don' t tell her,
lf I tell her, they will leave us in peace.
Mummy.
Mummy.
Why are you crying, children?
What happened in this room?
What did your mother do to you?
Something about the pillow.
With the pillow?
She didn' t kill us.
We' re not dead.
Why do you remain in this house?
We' re not dead.
We' re not dead.
We' re not dead.
- We' re not dead.
We' re not dead.
We' re not dead.
We' re not dead.
Yes, just a bit dizzy.
That' s all.
They made contact.
- All of three?
Yes. The mother and 2 children.
lnteresting, don' t you think?
lnteresting?
No!
So far we have handle this matter under your way.
We can' t stay in this house any longer.
This is quite clear that this being doesn' t want to leave here.
We don' t know anything about them yet.
We know the woman who went mad.
That quite enough.
We have to think of our son.
That' s nothing wrong.
No, he has nightmares, he seen this girl.
Even this lady has been processed by her.
Alright, we will leave tomorrow morning.
Oh thanks god for that.
I' m just going to check on Victor.
Once again, thank you very much for coming...
At first I could not understand what was the pillow doing in my hand
Why you didn' t move.
Then I knew.
I killed my children.
I got the riffle.
I pulled the trigger.
Then I heard your laughter, ln the bedroom.
You were playing with the pillow, like nothing has happened.
Then I thought the lord and his great mercy, has given me another chance.
No give up, be strong be a good mother.
But then, but now...
What' s all this mean?
Where are we?
The young lady asked the very same thing.
And that was the last time she ever spoken.
I couldn' t tell you that before.
Shall we make us a nice cup of tea?
The intruder are leaving, but others will come.
Some time we sense them, other time we won' t.
But that' s the way it always been.
Mummy, where' s daddy?
I don' t know.
lf we were dead, is there limbo?
I don' t even know is there are limbo.
I' m not worst then you are,
But I do know that I love you.
Always.
This house is ours, you say it with me.
This house is ours.
This house is ours.
Mummy look, it doesn' t hurt anymore.
No one can make us leave this house.
Come on Victor!
- What' s that ambulance doing there?
I' il check it out.
- How' s it going, Griff?
Is that him?
Might just be some crackpot but I figured I should call you anyway.
Did he ask for me by name?
Said he had some important info on it.
- Didn' t say what?
Said he' d only talk to you.
You the agent in charge of the "God' s Hand" case?
That' s right.
Wesley Doyle.
That a picture of you and your mother, huh?
I' d appreciate it if you wouldn' t take things off my desk.
Sorry about that.
Guess I' ve been in here a while.
Already had a look at all your plaques and your citations.
Didn' t really care to have a look at those.
What can I do for you, Mr...?
Meiks.
My name' s Fenton Meiks.
Now listen, this may sound a little bit crazy but...
I know who the "God' s Hand" killer is.
All right, I' il bite.
Who?
You haven' t even heard me out yet and already you doubt me.
Why is that?
It doesn' t happen that way.
- Sometimes truth defies reason.
So who is it then?
My brother.
What makes you think that?
last night.
Hello?
- Demons are taking over the world.
Adam?
- I can' t take it anymore!
- Now, let' s talk about this, Adam.
But there' s nothing to talk about!
It' s over... whatever happens, you have to take me to the rose garden.
- Now, that’ s just till...
You promised!
Meat?
That' s where all this took place.
It' s about 200 miles west of here, just north of Abilene.
Why did you go to Thurman?
To bury Adam, in the rose garden.
Why would you do that?
A long time ago.
That' s a pretty wild story, Mr. Meiks.
I don' t see what, if anything, this has got to do with my case.
Adam is the "God' s Hand" killer, Agent Doyle.
He' s the one you' re looking for.
If that' s the case, you left that part out.
- Oh, there' s more?
- A lot more.
Excuse me a minute.
Meat Sheriff' s office.
Can I talk to a sheriff, please?
This is Agent Doyle of the FBl.
He' s not in right now.
Well, I' ve got a man here in my office, name of Fenton Meiks.
Fenton Meiks?
- You know him?
- He caused a ruckus here earlier.
He stole an ambulance and his brother' s body too.
Yeah, it did.
So am I under arrest now?
You damn sure should be.
Nobody wants to press any charges.
- Well you gotta love small towns.
- Why would you go to all that trouble just to walk in here and confess it to me?
I' m here because I can' t live with what I know anymore.
What exactly do you know?
- Yeah, it is.
- I knew it.
You got the same eyes.
Why don’ t we get back to your story?
What makes you think that your brother' s the "God' s Hand" killer?
I know it was him.
How do you know?
It started back in Thurman.
It was near the summer of 1979.
I got the joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart.
You' re supposed to say, "Where?"
I don' t want to sing that dumb song.
All right.
I' il point to you when it' s time.
I got the joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart.
- Where?
I got the joy, joy, joy, joy down in my heart.
- Sit on a tack.
- Ouch!
- Who was that chick that threw up?
- Katie Hagen.
She' s sure pretty.
- It was real messy though.
All over the floor!
And when the principal fell...
I got the joy, joy, joy, joy...
We lived right behind the Thurman Public Rose Garden in the house where they used to keep the gardeners back in the fifties.
Dad had gotten a good deal on it back when he and Mom got married.
Adam was 3 years younger than me.
Our Mom died giving birth to him, so
I basically took care of him ever since I can remember.
Our Dad worked as a mechanic over in Jupiter.
He usually got home around 5. 30 and we' d all have dinner together.
- Hey, kiddos.
Something sure smells good.
- It was all right.
Let' s eat.
- Whoa, Tiger.
Save some for us.
You must.
You might turn into one.
- How did you do on that math test?
- I barely passed.
Well, I was never any good at math either.
Shoot, I still can' t do anything without a calculator.
- And that one' s going to be harder.
- Hey, don' t sound so glum.
Tell you what, we' il sit down this weekend and we' il see if we can' t figure out that junk together, okay?
Can we go see "Meatballs" after school tomorrow?
- We' ve already seen it.
- I want to see it again.
Nah, we' re gonna go see "The Warriors."
- Can' t.
It' s rated R. - We' il sneak in.
You sure about that, Adam?
Breath test time.
- brush them!
- I' m just joking with you, egghead!
Don’ t worry, Fenton.
I know you' re too big for a goodnight kiss.
Sleep tight.
That' s right.
- Love you too, Dad.
Night, Curtis.
I wanna see "Meatballs" again.
Fine, you can see "Meatballs" and I' il see "The Warriors."
Too bad.
Please?
All right.
Just go to bed.
That was our family.
Just the three of us.
We didn’ t mind though.
We didn' t need anybody else.
We were happy together.
Until...
- I' ve got something to tell you.
I need you both to listen to me very carefully.
Something' s happened.
A vision from God.
An angel came to him and told him the truth of this world and revealed God' s special purpose for our family.
It' s near.
The angel showed me.
There are demons among us.
The devil has released them for the final battle.
It' s being fought right now.
But nobody knows it except us and others like us.
- I' m scared, Dad.
- There' s nothing to be afraid of.
He will protect us.
He' s given us special jobs to do.
We don' t fear these demons, we destroy them.
We pick them up one by one, and we pitch them out of this world.
That' s God' s purpose for us.
The angel called us "God' s Hands."
That' s right.
We' re a family of superheroes that are gonna help save the world.
But, Dad, that doesn' t make any sense.
I know it sounds that way, son, but it' s the truth.
So what are our superpowers?
Well... we can see the demons while other people can' t.
The angel told me God would send us 3 weapons to destroy them with.
Magical weapons?
I imagine so.
When do we get them?
The angel just said soon.
Absolutely no- one.
If we do, we put them and ourselves in danger.
Fenton?
It' s a lot to understand.
But the angel said I had to do it now.
Fenton?
I didn’ t know what to say or how to feel.
Do you understand what I told you?
Judgment Day is here.
It was too messed up to understand or even acknowledge.
Soon we' il all be in Heaven.
You, me, Adam.
I didn’ t realize it at the moment, at least not consciously...
She' s waiting to see us in Heaven. but my happy and mostly secure world had just been flipped over.
Very dark things.
We' ve been chosen by God.
And my little boy' s mind just couldn' t take it.
Fenton!
Up and at 'em, boys!
Morning, kiddo.
It' s late.
Snap to it and get dressed.
Drop you guys off on the way.
What' s wrong with you?
Nothing.
Hey, let me have a bite of that.
None of us mentioned it It was only a dream, a nightmare.
Everything was okay, just like before.
Have a good day at school, boys.
We won' t, Dad.
Bye.
I want you all to copy down this sentence.
"The girl in the blue dress..."
I refused to believe it
- That next week was a dream too.
Like when Dad started bringing home the "magical" weapons.
He was on his way to work... when God called to him.
Be careful.
I still can' t understand what these gloves are for though.
I want you to write this down at the top of your pages in big letters.
Boys, look at this.
We got them all.
It won' t be long now.
The angel came again last night and told me that God will be sending us a list of the first 7 demons soon.
It wasn’ t real.
I just had to wait it out.
- Come over here a minute, Fenton.
That can wait.
I want to talk to you.
And I' m sorry.
But God has willed this and we must obey God.
I didn' t dream it.
I wouldn' t make up something like that, son.
Maybe...
Maybe you' re not right in the head.
It' s true.
You' il see that soon.
That' s what I wanted to talk to you about.
I got the first list.
The angel came to him while he was at work.
- these are people' s names.
And they' il look like people too.
But they' re not.
I' il reveal them for what they truly are.
That' s what the gloves are for.
I get them and bring them back here with the gloves on, and once they' re back here, I take the gloves off and reveal them.
Then you' il believe.
The dream had finally ended.
It was all real.
And I had to stop him.
But I couldn' t do that
I loved him even if he had gone crazy.
Dad, look, I got a list too.
Where did you get this, Adam?
God gave it to me.
Isn' t Travis Shed that boy that was picking on you at school last week?
He' s a demon.
Tell the truth, Adam.
You made this list up yourself, didn' t you?
- Adam?
Come on, right here.
Now, listen to me, son.
You can' t make stuff like that up.
We destroy demons.
If we were to use your list, we' d be killing people.
Killing people is bad.
I' m sorry, Dad.
It' s okay.
You just got to have a little patience.
Okay.
Go do some homework.
The only thing left to do was to tell.
That was easier said than done.
Dad had promised to take us to the movies that night, but he didn' t come home from work.
When' s Dad coming home?
I don' t know.
- It' s all make- believe, Adam.
Listen to me.
Daddy just made it up.
- No, he didn' t.
- He did too.
Just like Santa Claus.
You remember when you caught Dad putting our presents under the tree?
It' s just like that.
Adam, have I ever lied to you?
Dad made up this whole thing.
Do you understand?
- I don' t know.
But I think we should leave.
You mean... run away?
- a little while.
Neither do I.
But we might have to.
Why?
Dad' s gonna kill somebody.
Son, come over here.
Come on, I need your help.
Dad?
Come on out here, Adam.
Shine that light over here.
Hey, Dad, who is that?
That' s a demon, son.
It' s all right.
Go on, don' t be afraid.
God came to him earlier that day and told him that the time had come.
After work he drove down to Jacksonville, about 45 minutes or so southwest of Thurman.
God was leading him.
- Yes?
Please don' t.
- Fenton, if I could spare you this, I would.
But we are God' s servants and His will must be served.
Don' t be afraid, son.
Is that true?
Why would I make it up?
Dead.
Sir, I was thinking about heading out.
Unless you need me to stay.
No.
You go ahead.
Have a good night, sir.
So he killed that woman right there in front of you?
But not to his way of thinking.
You see, to him he hadn' t killed a woman, he' d destroyed a demon.
He believed that when he laid his hands on her, it revealed her sins.
Please!
No, Adam.
Do it like this.
It' s gotta be done in a certain way.
The angel was real specific.
Why out here in the rose garden?
Just like He chose us, I suppose.
Don' t cry for her, Fenton.
She wasn' t human.
Didn' t you see when I touched her?
I saw it, Dad.
You killed her.
She was a demon.
You know, I wasn' t so sure I could do it myself.
I mean, she looked like a woman to me too.
But after I touched her, all I could see was the evil.
And I had to do it.
I' m sorry you didn' t see it too.
You will next time.
You... you' re gonna do it again?
This is our job now, son.
You' ve got to accept that.
I won' t let you.
- I' il tell.
If you do, someone will die.
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
No.
I should have, but I was afraid.
I mean, I loved my father, but I was terrified of him.
So now you understand why I know my brother is the "God' s Hand" killer?
Have you got any physical proof?
I read in the paper that only one of the bodies of the 6 victims had been found.
It doesn' t necessarily mean it' s true.
Well, in this case it does.
See, the first victim was found mutilated with a note saying that God' s Hand had taken him.
No bodies.
Oh, we don' t for sure.
But the first note said we wouldn' t find any more bodies from then on.
Said he wanted to keep them.
I got a pretty good idea where the rest of them bodies are.
The rose garden?
Now why didn' t you tell me that in the first place?
Would you have believed me?
Come on.
Here.
What' s this?
Put them on.
Or I' il put them on for you.
Let' s go.
Why didn' t you come see me sooner?
You' re gonna wanna get on 30 east up here.
I can' t imagine how you can keep something like that inside so long.
I guess I avoided it because I wanted to.
You never did tell me why it is you just keep one picture of your mother in your office.
My mother was murdered a couple days after that picture was taken.
Butchered by some whacked- out killer like your dad.
Did they ever catch him?
No.
Is that why you took this job?
You ever think about becoming a cop?
Well, you know, when I was a kid.
Well, you got the instincts for it.
A cop' s gotta have good instincts.
You know what mine are telling me now?
You' re hiding something from me.
What is it you think I' m hiding?
Maybe I' il figure it out.
You okay, Dad?
I' m all right son.
Here I come.
Dad, why did God let this happen to me?
Don’ t blame God, Davy.
God let me do it.
What God lets you do is decide for yourself what you will do.
- You' re not puppet with strings.
So God doesn’ t make you do anything.
He wants you to decide for yourself.
After that night nothing much happened.
Neither did Adam.
Once a full month had gone by, I' d completely convinced myself it was over and everything was gonna be all right
- Bye.
Remember when Daisy Duke bent over?
He' s funny.
Man, I' d do anything to really see her tits.
- Ahhh... you said "tits."
You wanna spend the night tonight?
- I' il have to ask Dad though.
- I' il see you in a little bit.
- Bye.
- Hey, what' s "wrap" mean?
Tell you later.
Come on, I' il race you.
Come on!
No, I' m gonna go round on the road.
- Dad?
- In here.
Whose van is that out there?
Ours.
Ain' t she a beauty?
I told her not tonight.
We got some work to do in the morning.
Dad told us that there were moments when people could just disappear without anyone knowing where they went or why.
He said those were the moments when God' s Hands could take you.
According to Dad, nothing, not even a camera, could catch us.
We were invisible when we were God' s Hands.
What do we do now, Dad?
We' il get him when he comes out just like I told you, remember?
Fenton?
- I can' t do this, Dad.
- I can do it, Dad.
- You sure can, tiger.
- Well, what if someone sees us?
- God will blind them for us.
There he is, boys.
- Come on, Fenton.
Now move.
Do what I tell you!
Trixie, come on!
Come, Trixie!
What you doing, boy?
My dog... she' s under your car.
Oh, well, let' s see.
Help me grab his legs.
Help me grab his legs now!
Come on!
Edward March.
Well, it' s not.
You didn' t think anyone knew about that, did you?
- But God saw you.
Please!
Quiet!
And you can' t escape God' s wrath!
Can' t believe you still didn' t see it.
He was the murderer of little children, Fenton.
Babies.
Babies.
He' s the murderer.
We gotta get out of here, Adam.
- What do you mean?
- Gotta run away.
Told you we might have to.
I don' t wanna run away.
- We have to.
- Why?
Listen to me, Adam.
- No, he doesn' t.
- He' s a demon slayer.
No, it' s not.
Dad' s brainwashed you.
It' s all a big lie.
He' s a murderer and you help him.
We’ re just serving God' s will.
Adam!
Get up and get dressed.
And don’ t wake your brother.
Sit down.
Your brother told me what you said last night.
I want you to know I' ve never killed anything in my whole life.
That' s a lie and you know it.
I did a lot of thinking and praying after you went to bed.
I asked the angel to visit you.
But instead he visited me.
I don’ t want to believe.
What?
It doesn' t matter.
Because together you and I are gonna prove him wrong.
You just don' t have any faith.
That' s why you can' t see the truth.
But we' re gonna change that.
I want you to dig a hole right here.
Need to be about 10 feet deep and 15 feet wide on both sides.
The length and the width should form a perfect square.
- What?
- You heard me.
Why?
Because I' m your father and you' il do what I tell you.
Understand?
- Do you?
- Yes, sir.
I expect half that to be dug by the time I get home tonight.
- Dad, I can' t do that.
- Pray!
I started digging that goddamn hole, but I did not pray.
I would not.
I hated God, I despised Him.
My hatred helped me dig, kept me going.
Dad' s or God’ s or whoever’ s plan it was, it would not work on me.
I knew what Dad was doing was wrong, and nothing was gonna change that
Sorry I told on you.
- You tell him about running away?
There' s no reason to go.
- No, he' s not.
I' ve been praying for you.
Nope, and I' m not going to!
- But Dad said...
- I don' t care what Dad said!
He might be able to make me dig this hole but he can' t make me pray.
Just get out of here and leave me alone.
I' il help you if you promise you won' t tell Dad.
- But there' s another
- shovel in the shed.
- Get out of here!
I wanted to run away... faraway, but
I still couldn' t leave Adam, no matter how crazy Dad was turning.
Besides, there was nowhere to go.
- Finally gave up, huh, kiddo?
- I' il be there again in the morning.
Come on, I didn' t mean it like that.
I don' t want to fight with you, son.
I' m not doing this to hurt you.
Wish you could understand that.
What' s the matter with you?
- Nothing.
- They' re fine.
Didn' t you wear gloves today?
I didn' t need them.
I' m fine.
Here.
Help ease the pain.
I said I was fine.
I know you' re mad at me but that' s no reason to cause yourself pain.
I got an extra pair of work gloves in the shed.
I want you to use these from now on.
It won' t do you any good now that you' ve wrecked your hands, but a couple of days and you' il be fine.
I want you to know I' m proud of you.
And I know God' s proud of you too.
Take some time off and let those blisters callous over.
Then you can get back to it, all right?
Well, good night then.
Bedtime.
Please, Dad?
Come on.
I' il be in to say goodnight in a minute.
My hands bled, but I wouldn' t stop.
I kept at it morning, noon and night for 5 days.
And by the sixth day, That hole was as dark as my hatred for Dad' s God.
Well, you finished it all right.
Nope.
We started the cellar after that.
At least that' s what Dad called it.
But I knew better.
We were building a dungeon down there.
Get it over there.
Dad said it would hold.
He said God would see to it
Get back here and help me push!
Push it!
Keep it moving!
You boys did good.
I just did as I was told.
- Well, what do you think?
- All right.
The next night he brought home another demon.
Get down there.
It has to be done.
It' s God' s will.
Come on, do it like I showed you... the neck first, Fenton!
Fenton, get back here!
Fenton!
I half expected angels or God to come out of the night and stop me.
It had to end.
- Hello?
We have complaints of a 501 driving on the alternate side of the street
Hello?
Don' t break my door down.
Well, what' s your problem?
Craziest thing I' ve heard in a long time.
- You can' t.
- making up stories like that.
- But, it' s true!
I can show you!
Let' s go.
- It' s around back, under the shed.
- That' s enough of that now, boy.
- No... he' s around back.
See what your dad' s got to say about all this.
What' s the trouble, sheriff?
Sorry to wake you, but your boy here seems to have a problem.
Come on in.
I was about to head over to Lake Thompson, to get a jump on the bass.
And he comes running in with this wild story.
- It' s the truth and you know it.
It makes me mad to think that he told everyone down at your office too.
Course, I don' t believe a word of it.
What does get me, though, is why would he make up such a crazy story?
I don' t know why he made it up.
Probably did it to get back at me for punishing him earlier.
Did you tell him about that?
He' s lying.
Just check the shed.
I don' t know what to do with him.
Well, they hit puberty, seem to lose all respect for you.
Me and my boys survived it.
You will too.
Just check the shed or the rose garden.
I could show you where
- Why don' t you just quit all this?
Please, I can show you.
Maybe we ought to check the shed just to quiet him down.
Well, if it has to be done, it has to be done.
What do you think, kiddo?
Does it have to be done?
See?
I figured we ought to have a storm cellar.
Just watch your step.
I' m not much of a carpenter.
I don' t see a thing.
He was here.
You realize the trouble you could get into over a thing like this?
They must have moved him because he was here.
Adam' s got him somewhere, I know it.
- I think I' ve seen enough.
I could show you where the bodies are buried.
Please!
May God welcome you and keep you.
I never killed a man before tonight.
I' ve seen you kill plenty.
Those were demons.
That was a man.
- You didn' t have to kill him.
- I had to protect our mission.
There is no mission!
That man is dead because of you.
You see him?
He' s dead because you have no faith.
Do you understand what you made me do?
You did!
You' re crazy!
Shut up!
Dad, don' t!
I can' t.
Don' t cry.
Wait a minute, Fenton.
Go on, it' s all right.
Come into the shed.
Come in and shut the door.
Are you afraid?
- You.
Only demons should fear me.
And you' re not a demon, are you?
The angel said you were.
I won' t.
And I love you more than my own life.
You know what’ s funny about all this, Fenton?
I' m afraid of you.
Go on.
- But, Dad.
- I don' t want to do this, Fenton, but I have to.
I had to kill a man tonight.
I can' t let that happen again.
But, Dad, I promise I won' t tell.
I wish I could.
Now go on.
But, Dad, I' m sorry.
I' m sorry too but this has to be done.
Now you get on down there or I' il put you down there myself.
- Go!
No!
Dad!
- Please, Dad, don' t!
- Please, no!
- Only He can help you now.
Please, don' t do this, Dad!
Please, it' s me, Fenton, okay?
Please don' t do this.
It' s me, Fenton.
Please!
Please, don' t do this.
No, please, Dad!
Fenton?
Adam?
Adam, is that you?
Adam?
I can' t.
But I' m hungry and I gotta go to the bathroom.
Dad won' t let me feed you.
I brought you some water though.
But I' il bring you more if I can.
Look, Adam, he' s gonna kill me.
You gotta get me out of here.
I can' t.
Put your mouth to the knothole right here.
You ready?
- for later?
- More!
- You' ve gotta get me out of here.
- Dad says you' il probably be out of there by the end of the week.
You just have to accept God' s will.
I can' t stay
Adam?
Adam?
The days came and went.
I counted them by the light through the hatch door and Adam' s visits.
I only slept when I passed out from exhaustion.
Didn' t he ever come back to at least check on you?
On the seventh day.
Has God spoken to you yet?
There is no God.
I lost count of the days after that.
It felt like weeks.
I finally went beyond fear into total insanity.
He had finally sent me a vision.
It was then that I understood my destiny just like Dad said I would.
Fenton?
Fenton?
Fenton.
Come on, kiddo.
Give me that water.
Easy.
Here you go, buddy.
I saw God!
Just try to take a little sip.
Don' t want to eat too fast, you' il make yourself sick.
So did God tell you about the demons?
Sorry I ever doubted you.
What did God look like?
- Kind of hard to describe.
- Was He big?
He can' t explain something
- But I want to know.
- Then maybe you should pray for it.
That' s right.
But look at the price he paid.
That' s all behind us now.
Isn' t it, Fenton?
So we gonna go get us a demon now?
When Fenton' s ready.
A week later I was ready.
My first demon was to be Brad White from Dallas.
- I see it.
Yes, sir.
I bought these for you.
You' il need them now that God has spoken to you.
- All right, let' s go.
Not this time, Adam.
You stay here and keep your eyes peeled.
Your time will come.
Let' s go.
My mom and I, we got a flat on our van.
- Well, I was wondering if you had a tire iron.
Hey, pal, what' s with the gloves?
Oh, to change the tire.
- Don' t want to get your hands dirty?
Brad, who is it?
Mind your business, you fucking bitch!
Goddamn women.
Yeah, I think I got one for you.
- Out back.
Back here.
Let' s see.
Here it is.
Grab his legs.
Brad White?
I' ve been waiting for this moment ever since all this started.
I' m ready to fulfill my destiny.
I' m proud of you, son.
Get your fucking hands away!
Destroy him!
Dad!
Dad, no, no, no!
No!
I buried him in the rose garden.
We went to the sheriff' s office a week later and told them that Dad just didn' t come home one day.
They filed a missing persons but they didn' t find anything.
After awhile they sent us to separate orphanages.
So, nobody ever knew about any of this?
No.
Not until now.
He didn' t tell anybody?
Mind if we just sit here?
I don' t much feel like talking anymore.
Tell me more about that promise you made to your brother.
It was later on that night.
Adam?
If you ever destroy me, promise me you' il bury me here.
I promise to God I' il bury you here.
I don' t get it.
Yeah.
If he killed you.
Destroyed.
Don' t make any sense.
Yes, it does.
If that man standing in front of you is Adam Meiks.
So you killed all those people.
No, I told you before, I' ve never killed anyone in my life.
Fenton was the killer.
Just stop the bullshit and tell me the truth.
You' il understand soon.
Just let me show you where I buried Fenton.
Hold it.
You take it real slow.
That' s it.
This is the spot.
There' s too many graves here.
There' s only six victims.
Fenton didn' t bury his victims here.
He kept them as trophies in his basement.
This is where I put demons.
He was.
That' s why he couldn' t see the truth.
Dad knew it too.
You see, God asked Dad to destroy his son, much like He asked Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac.
But Dad couldn' t do it.
And God didn' t take pity on Dad like He did Abraham.
So He handed down the duty to me.
Fenton knew I' d come.
That' s why he left those notes to lure me in.
I guess he figured when the killings made the news that I' d come for him.
But I had to wait till God put him on my list
To come before that would have been murder.
Adam?
Jesus Christ, you really do believe all this stuff.
I' ve always believed.
That' s all lies, Adam.
No, it' s not.
Fenton or Adam or whatever your damn name is.
I don' t really give a fuck.
All I need to know right now is you' re a murdering son of a bitch.
And I got you.
Maybe.
But that' s not gonna bring your mother back, is it?
She' s dead and her killer got away, didn' t he?
Dirty little son of a...
How did you know?
You were on my list.
You didn' t think anybody knew about that, did you?
God knew.
That' s why he sent me.
I' m an FBI agent.
They' il come looking for me.
No, they won' t.
They' il keep looking for Fenton.
You' re going to be his last victim.
They' ve seen you.
They' il know it was you.
God will protect me.
Are you sure neither one of you can remember what he looks like?
Look, I told you it’ s just a blur.
I shook his hand.
You' ve got to take a look at this.
There he is.
We got you now, buddy.
- What is this?
- All the tapes look like this.
- We' re running the name he gave you.
- It' s got to be a fake name.
Fenton Meiks.
Fenton Meiks, this is the FBl!
Go!
Oh, my God.
There' s no one here, sir.
We found this in the basement.
Is he down there too?
Not him.
Excuse me.
Didn' t hear you come in.
How can I help you?
Is he in?
Sure thing.
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, I' m fine, thanks.
- Well, hey, Curtis.
- Afternoon, Becky.
Yeah.
I' m agent Griffin Hull of the FBl.
I need to ask you some questions about your brother.
Fenton?
Yes, sir.
Why don' t you come on around back?
Well, I appreciate you coming by to tell me personally.
I just wanted you to know before we go public.
Well, listen, if there' s anything I can do, don' t hesitate to call.
But again, if you can think of anything, or if he contacts you...
- Of course.
You' re a good man, Agent Hull.
Everything okay, Adam?
Everything' s just fine, Becky.
God' s will has been served.
Praise God.
I had hit rock bottom.
My friends were gone.
I was sick.
Then someone appeared in front of me.
A girl.
I was afraid.
But she was more afraid than i.
Someone had mistreated her.
She picked me up from the bottom.
She helped me.
And then i helped her.
So here we are.
Eddie?
Never mind.
I' m cutting the last of your long hair now.
Ready?
There.
Do you think I' m getting old?
- No.
- Are you sure?
I was invisible to you, to begin with.
Have you forgotten that?
No.
I haven' t.
You were so sweet.
That is something one never forgets.
What do you want?
- I don' t know.
It' s coming up.
- I don' t want to say it.
- But I want to get you something.
All I want is you.
And I want you.
Now.
I caught 15 perch yesterday.
- But I' m still no good at casting.
- No, that' s difficult.
Here y ou go.
Hi.
Eddie isn' t here.
I think I' m pregnant.
Strange, huh?
I' il let Eddie know you were here.
Eddie?
ls that you, Eddie?
I don' t know what to say.
I didn' t recognize you.
You' ve grown a beard.
- It look s good.
- Thanks.
And you' ve gained...
- I am doing well.
- I can tell.
How are you doing?
It' s been a while.
Five years and forty days.
What are you doing here?
Just driving around.
I' m a salesman.
I' m heading to Umeå.
This is the wrong road.
I can drive where ever i want.
Want to get a beer?
I' ve stopped drinking.
Just one.
- Two.
- Three!
It' s great to see you.
- What kind of car is that?
- It' s a Chevy.
You look strong.
Go in and pay.
- What' s in the box?
- What?
- What' s in the box?
- Nothing.
Nothing?
Can i have a peek?
No.
- Your car?
Maria?
- Do you have a Maria?
- I have a Maria.
Eddie...
Shit!
You' ve made it.
I think so.
It' s her 25 th birthday today.
25 th?
25 th!
You have to come out to the farm, meet Maria.
I' il come some other time, when it' s more appropriate.
- Don' t you have time?
Two more beers!
She' s afraid of the dark.
Afraid of being alone.
Maria?
Happy birthday to you...
No, no...
This isn' t working.
I can' t believe this.
I thought you were bragging about this place.
It' s fantastic!
He died a few years ago.
He was a minister.
This was good, Eddie.
Ready for your present?
Warmer, warmer... colder.
Did you really go to school together?
Warmer...
Eddie!
What is that?
A hockeystick?
For catching butterflies.
There are so many butterflies here.
Thank you.
I like it.
- Thanks for inviting me.
- Don' t mention it.
You have a good life.
Why did i never hear from you?
Why did you never come visit?
Five years.
That' s a long time.
Especially in there.
I can understand why you didn' t want to think about me.
I don' t want to talk about it.
Not here at the table.
It' s Maria' s birthday.
Of course.
Cheers, Maria.
Happy birthday.
Eddie and i have known each other a long time.
Want to play a game?
You have to close your eyes.
Sit like this.
Arms like this.
Both of you.
Draw a deep breath.
- I knew it.
- That' s what makes it so horrible.
You know something terrible is going to happen.
And then it does.
- Your turn, Maria.
- I don' t want to play.
I love your hair.
What are you staring at?
Are you pregnant, Maria?
Are you?
Sit down.
That' s great.
Really great.
- He look s like a little boy.
- I don' t think so.
Like a little boy.
Bullshit.
He isn' t even asleep.
What do you mean?
You' re strong.
Everything is going your way.
- Are you proud?
- Yes, I am proud.
And Maria.
Maria della rossa.
- Are you asleep?
- I' m sorry.
I' m the one that should apologize.
I was going to tell you.
It' s OK.
It' s OK.
I can' t have a baby.
What?
We can' t.
Come here.
Of course you can.
You are going to, and you can.
- You think so?
- Yes.
Thank you.
You are kind.
Can' t you make him go away?
He did me a favor once, now i have to help him.
- The lake is full of perch and pike.
- You eat pike?
- ls it any good?
- It' s excellent.
I put my finger here, let go...
Up like this, and...
I know where he lives.
I know where he lives.
Who?
The bastard who double- crossed us.
Not far from here.
He' s lived a good life with our money.
That' s all I' ve been able to think about:
When i get out, I' m going to visit him.
I have nothing, Eddie.
Eddie, i need you to come with me.
I can' t do it on my own.
You know the rules, Kullmann.
You' il get over it.
It just takes time.
That' s just the way it is.
You' il get over it.
- It' s been five years.
- You need more time.
- You can' t ask me now.
- I just thought...
You can' t ask me now!
Reel it in.
I said reel it in.
- I caught one!
Reel it in slowly.
Slowly!
Take the hook out and release it.
It' s too small.
What' s with your roof, Eddie?
It needs fixing.
I know a guy who sells roofing tile.
It' s going to rain into your bedroom.
You have to get that fixed.
Don' t be afraid.
OK, come on.
I' m holding you.
Come on.
Don' t forget to breathe.
Keep your head above water!
You' re swimming!
Breathe out.
You' re swimming!
How is your back?
Stiff.
My dad had the same back problem, but he never made it out of bed.
You get used to it.
- How is Maria doing?
- Fine.
This is prime topsoil.
Poor things like this need all the help they can get.
Guess I' il head home now...
What' s this?
Roofing tile.
Where did you get it?
We...
- We talked about this earlier.
- I didn' t ask you to get tiles.
No, but we did talk about it.
- Where did you get this?
- I told you.
My friend sells it.
Are you accusing me of...
Do you think...
- Do you think i have stolen it?
- No, that' s not it.
I just don' t know where you got it.
- That' s all i' m saying.
- Do you think i stole it?
Have i said that?
Have i used those words?
- Then what are you saying?
- I don' t know where you got this.
- So you think i stole it.
- That' s not what i' m saying!
- What are you saying?
You are wearing my shoes and jacket.
- The shoes were in the hall...
- Don' t you have your own clothes?
- I was wet.
- I know.
These shoes were in the hall!
Shit!
I got you some roofing tile.
You have a leak over the kitchen.
- Aren' t you leaving soon?
- What?
Aren' t you leaving?
I won' t bother you anymore.
Eddie?
Eddie!
Hello?
It' s just a little scratch.
Maria?
Can you help me into the house?
Let' s see.
- You have to help.
- One, two, three!
Thank you.
- Can you walk?
- Sure.
Let' s go inside.
Maria, do you have a needle and thread?
I cut my self a little, trimming that spruce.
She' s too good for you.
You' il have to help me, Eddie.
- How long is he staying?
- I don' t know.
He can' t leave now.
He did it on purpose.
Cut his leg?
He knew what he was doing.
No.
I was watching him.
I knew he would cut himself.
- You' re saying he did it on purpose?
- It looked like it.
That' s not the same as actually doing it.
It' s my dog.
You have a dog?
I have a dog.
Tito.
- What' s he doing in your trunk?
Aren' t you planning on burying him?
Sure, but I didn' t want to trouble you with that my first night.
I should have told you.
I' m sorry.
Where did you get him?
I didn' t know you had a dog.
- You know nothing about me.
- I know there' s a dog in your trunk!
- I was going to bury him.
Today.
How did he die?
I backed up over him.
You ran over him?
I backed up over him.
He never used to sit behind the car.
- It was a tragedy.
- You can say that again.
I' il go bury him now.
You can visit the grave tomorrow.
I' ve seen you somewhere before.
I don' t think so.
Have a seat.
What do you want?
I' ve seen you before.
- Haven' t i?
- I wouldn' t know.
You were... out of it.
You didn' t seem to care.
I am also out of it.
Maria?
Are you Eddie' s buddy?
Don' t want to talk?
Can' t you talk?
Eddie...
I am also Eddie' s buddy.
lnto the jungle.
I have used one of these many times.
Mostly Eddie, though...
That' s what happens when people owe money.
You have to...
You have to use it sometimes.
Even if you don' t want to.
Understand?
They didn' t understand either.
Until afterward.
Very well.
You be careful with this.
Can a barn just self- ignite?
I' ve been looking for Bamse.
- Bamse?
- My dog.
He didn' t come home.
He usually comes home at night to sleep under his favorite chair.
You haven' t seen him, have you?
No, i didn' t think so.
Let me know if you do.
Bamse!
Dammit!
What color is your dog?
- Brown.
What color is he?
- Brown.
- Brown? ls your dog brown?
- ls he really brown?
- What' s with you?
Yes, he' s brown.
Did you burn down the barn, too?
I don' t know what to say, Sven.
This is horrible.
- He told me everything.
- What?
What' s done is done.
Maybe we should leave.
Bye, Sven.
What did you tell Sven?
- I told him we did it.
I said we ran over his dog.
I told him you backed up over his dog.
- Why did you tell him that?
- It was spur of the moment.
I couldn' t get my self to say that i did it, because he was so...
He was sad.
So you told him that i killed his dog?
It was hard for me to admit it, so i said it was you.
He' s my neighbor.
He does everything for me.
For me, Kullmann!
Here, where i live.
Let' s go back.
We' il go back and tell him the truth.
Kullmann had something else to tell you.
It wasn' t...
Eddie didn' t run over your dog.
I did.
I came around the corner, and there he was.
He' s a big dog, Sven.
He jumped up on the car and started barking.
He was a good dog.
I think you should leave now.
I mean, what happened...
You did hard time.
But you know the rules.
You took your punishment.
Took it for both of us.
Say no more, Eddie.
I can' t play your game anymore.
I can' t.
I am going to leave, and y ou' il never have to see me again.
Eddie?
- as soon as you help me with this one tiny favor.
Then i will leave.
What are you doing?
Thinking.
Good thoughts?
It moved.
- The baby?
- Yes, it moved.
That' s good.
- Can i feel?
- No.
- Why not?
- I don' t want you to.
It' s perfectly normal.
They kick.
They grow.
- This will never end.
- Of course it will.
- Why don' t you lie down?
- No.
I can' t go fishing today.
Here.
I can' t go fishing today.
Listen to me.
I can' t go fishing.
I want you to go home.
I don' t feel well.
I can' t.
Listen to me!
Go home!
Go home!
Go home!
What' s the matter?
I' m freezing.
Now i remember.
I remember what it was.
You were crazy.
ln a nice way.
Yes, i guess i was a little crazy.
I miss that... sometimes.
The craziness.
You have a hair in your mouth.
- Aren' t you cold?
- No.
I' m going back to bed.
- Yes.
Must be something i ate.
Maybe that mutton.
No, i ate lots of that mutton.
- I don' t want him here while i' m sick.
- Then who' s going to fix the roof?
What' s the matter?
What is it, Eddie?
I think it' s something i ate.
- Should we call a doctor?
No doctor.
For Maria' s sake, too, and the baby?
This could be serious.
lf you have a virus, you should stay away from Maria.
You don' t look good.
Shouldn' t we call a doctor?
- No, i can sleep in the hall.
- That' s not necessary.
- I want you to sleep here.
- No!
You OK?
- Shouldn' t we call a doctor?
- Eddie doesn' t like doctors.
Get some rest, Eddie.
Eddie!
He needs to see a doctor.
You aren' t well, Eddie!
- Let me help you.
- Don' t bother.
Eddie...
I can get up myself.
- Let me help you.
- Haven' t you ruined enough now?
You' re being unfair.
Come back!
- Let me help you up.
- Don' t bother.
Leave me alone.
What have i done, Eddie?
What have you done?
What haven' t you done?
You' ve ruined everything.
You are the one ruining everything, Eddie.
- I' m ruining everything?
- Yes, you' re ruining everything!
ls it me?
Yes, it' s you, you fucking bastard!
Why did you stop hitting me?
- Come on.
Keep hitting.
- You' re ruining everything!
Hit me!
ls it me?
Am i the one that' s ruining everything?
ls it really me?
You do nothing but lie!
All you do is lie!
You lie!
You' re the worst liars!
I' m the fucking junky here, aren' t i?
Go ahead, crush me!
You' re nice.
Nice?
- Do you like me?
- I think you' re fantastic.
- Would you run off with me?
- Yes.
- What about Eddie?
- He' il be fine.
Just us?
Close your eyes.
Stand up.
Close your eyes.
Take your shirt off.
Take your pants off.
Take them off.
I' il be right out.
Take care.
Did you find your dog?
Yes, we found him.
OK.
- Hi. ls Lasse home?
- No.
Do you know what time it is?
- ls Lasse home?
- Do you know what time it is?
- Lasse' s at the hospital.
- I have something for him.
He isn' t here!
He' s at the hospital!
Are you crazy?
- Where is Lasse?
- At the hospital!
- What are you doing here?
- I don' t know.
I just met her.
- What are you doing here?
- Go to your room!
Get out of here!
Are you crazy?
There are kids here!
Her tongue is stuck in her throat!
Hurry up, for Christ' s sake!
Kullmann, get in here!
Hurry!
Do it!
Help her breathe!
Are you OK?
Can you hear me?
Are you OK?
I knew... this was wrong.
You were never really a friend.
Not really.
Eddie...
I dreamed that i had a bearded baby.
I think i want this child.
Sleep.
Just when you think everything is fine.
You think you have made it.
It takes so Iittle for everything to change.
Just a glance over the shoulder at a gasstation, -
- and nothing wiII ever be the same again.
Nothing will ever be the same.
You are back where it all began.
I got out of the institution on the day of my sister' s wedding.
I' d started to get used to the place... breakfast at 8: 00, classes at 2: 00, therapy at 4: 00 and asleep by 10: 00.
You can call me anytime, Lee.
I will always try and be of help to you.
Inside, life was simple.
Thank you, Dr. Twardon.
For that reason, I was reluctant to go.
Bon voyage.
Hi, Peter.
Peter, yeah, who you almost successfully forgot.
No, I did not.
Are you happy to be home?
I mean, are you happy to be home?
How did you know?
I know what you mean.
You Iook so beautiful.
Thanks, Dad.
I thought you stopped.
Do you know how much we missed you, pumpkin?
I missed you too.
I don' t feel so good.
Let' s go sit down.
You want to talk to me like a child.
Think I don' t know what I' m doing?
You act like a child!
You' ve been fired!
Well, I' m glad I' m fired.
Boy, I hated that job.
I don' t care that you hated it.
You' re drunk!
Why do you... why do you...
Why do you always say that?
Watch this, huh?
Avoid the temptation of placing your fingers on the home keys by sight.
Strike each key so that your fingers bounce with each stroke.
Do not strike without thinking.
Do not even attempt to steaI a glance at your paper.
'My flowers had just about given up in despair, so with the exception of a few potted plants from the florist, we' re flowerless for the first spring in years.'
And... time.
I' m so proud of you, honey... being out in the world like this.
When my accident happened we were in the kitchen and my back was to her.
Upstairs, my dad was just leaving for work at Havis Department Store.
- I slipped and cut too deep.
I' m not sure how I could have misjudged.
I' ve been doing it since 7th grade.
Just a precaution.
'Be a leader.'
I have never had a job before.
But I can assure you that I am very excited about this opportunity.
Thank you.
I don' t have any references yet.
But I think that the Municipal Tax Office would be a wonderful place... to begin... my career.
'Secretary.'
Hello, I...
Wait.
Hello?
Hello?
In here.
Hi.
Hi.
Are you the lawyer?
Yes.
- No.
No, stay.
That' s right.
No.
Do you plan on getting pregnant?
No.
Are you living in an apartment?
- A house.
Alone?
Siblings?
My sister is going to live in the backyard, with her husband, in the pool house.
Are you married?
No.
Yes.
- What did you win the award in?
Typing.
Are those your scores?
Yes.
Holloway.
Could you get me a cup of coffee with sugar?
Yes, I do.
You scored higher than anyone I' ve ever interviewed.
You' re really overqualified for the job.
- I want to be bored.
I have a part- time paralegal.
All I need is a typist, who can get to work on time... and answer the phone.
We only use typewriters here, not computers.
That' s fine.
- It' s very dull work.
I like dull work.
There' s something about you.
You' re... you' re... closed tight.
Wall.
I know.
I don' t know.
I' m not here.
Less sugar in the coffee.
Lee:
I got it.
I knew you could do it!
'Hello...'
'Hello.
You have reached the office of Mr. E. Edward Grey.
Please leave your message and the time you called along with your phone number and the best time to reach you... and we... will get back to you as soon as possible. '
'We.'
Secretary...
Type up this letter and send four copies to O' Malley & Barrett.
Right away, sir.
That' s good.
So you' re the new secretary?
Yeah.
Excuse me?
What exactly is a paralegal?
See ya.
I brought you these.
I think I accidentally threw out my notes on the Feldman case.
Maybe you could...
- Go through the garbage?
Yes, Lee, thank you.
Why are you here?
I' m just waiting for you, honey.
But I' m here for five more hours.
I know.
It' s okay.
I found another set.
This needs more sugar.
And six copies of these.
Freshen up that trap, Lee, and put out one more.
Mice like to go behind the chairs too, Lee.
Just because it' s hard to reach... does not mean we don' t take care of every possibility.
Here, give me that.
Thank you.
E. Edward Grey' s office, may I help you?
Is he in?
- Could you just wait one moment?
You' re right, that is a very good offer.
I' m going back now.
- Could you wait one minute, please?
Yes, I do understand that.
Submissive.
Excuse me?
Edward!
I have no idea if we make... over $40 worth of long distance calls to Chattanooga each month.
Tell him it' s Tricia O' Connor.
Mr. Grey?
Hello?
Mr. Grey?
Ms. Holloway.
Mr. Grey?
I' m not here.
I' m afraid he' s gone.
Is that right?
E. Edward Grey' s office.
It' s me.
- Daddy?
It' s so good to hear your voice.
Dad... where are you?
I' m downtown... somewhere.
Could you please hold?
Do you have a message, Ms. O' Connor?
Tell him to sign the settlement.
Hello?
Hello, Dad?
Fine.
How' s Mr. Grey?
He' s fine.
Peter called.
Some people have to wash something... as soon as they' ve worn it for like half a day.
- And then you got... your more laid- back folk, who will wash this stuff when it' s dirty.
Which kind are you?
I' m the type of guy... who wants to get married and have a kid.
I wash my clothes just when they' re dirty.
Me too, and that is what counts in a relationship.
Compatibility.
In a relationship?
May I interest you in a little more?
Okay.
You' re different than you were in high school, Peter.
I' ve changed.
What happened?
- I had a nervous breakdown.
Me too.
Sort of.
Tom, I have this and these.
Peter?
- Yes, Lee?
I' ve read that if you wear that kind of underwear that it squeezes... your 'thingies.'
Balls... my balls?
- Yes.
My 'grapes'?
- Your grapes.
- Your testicles.
Your sperm gets' squozen 'and then you can' t have babies... and I thought that you said that you wanted to have babies.
There you go, I said it.
To babies.
Diapers.
Diaper rash.
Breast feeding and crying.
Look at it.
Do you see that?
- What?
This letter has three typing errors in it, one of which is, I believe, a spelling error.
- This isn' t the first time, either.
This cannot go on.
Do you know what this makes me look like... to the people who receive these letters?
I' m sorry.
Type it again... and get it right.
You' re wasting my time.
Bye.
Go type up a bill for that woman for $500.
Aren' t you going to proofread the letter?
Lee... when people come into this office,... you are a visual representation of my business... and the way you dress is disgusting.
Sorry.
You' re tapping your toe all the time and playing with your hair.
You' re either going to have to wear a hair net or stop playing with your hair.
And another thing... do you realize that you are always sniffling?
I' m sniffling?
And what is with your tongue... when you' re typing?
I' m sorry, I didn' t know I sniffled.
Well, you do.
'Mr. Grey... thank you so much for your helpful suggestions.
Because I am trying to be... the very best secretary that I can be for you. '
Are you sure you wouldn' t like some wine?
We make it homemade, don' t we, Stewart?
Try it, it' s good.
- Would you like some, Lee?
No, thank you.
Not right now, Sylvia.
Peter talks about you all the time.
He says he' s found his soul mate.
I did.
- Peter' s sister Lindsey... is getting married this coming winter in Vegas.
Did you know Peter has a very stable job at J. C. Penney?
They even gave him a cell phone.
- Perhaps it' II be a double wedding?
Ms. Holloway.
Come into the library... immediately.
The phone is ringing.
Answer it.
- Brr- ing!
'Hello.
This is the office of... '
Listen... you' re a big girl.
You can get a much bigger voice out of that tiny throat of yours.
Tiny?
- Ms. Holloway,... you told me when I hired you that you were used to answering phones.
I am.
I...
- The phone is ringing.
'Hello... this is the office of Mr. E. Edward Grey.'
You see?
That' s showing a little spunk.
I' m not running a mortuary.
No.
Lee.
Mr. Grey...?
Come here.
Yes.
With whom did you have a date?
Peter.
- Peter.
Did you have sex?
No?
I don' t know.
Are you shy?
I' m shy.
You' re a lawyer.
I' m shy.
I overcome my shyness... in order to get things done.
I don' t think you' re shy.
Lee, I' m going to be frank with you.
I know I' m your employer... and we have a proscribed relationship...
but you really should feel free... to discuss your problems with me.
What' s going on with the sewing kit and the Band- Aids?
Lee...?
I feel...
Shy.
Do you want some hot chocolate?
Why do you cut yourself, Lee?
I don' t know.
Is it that sometimes the pain inside has to come to the surface... and when you see evidence of the pain inside... you finally know you' re really here?
Then when you watch the wound heal it' s comforting, isn' t it?
that' s a way to put it.
Yes.
- Are you listening?
You will never... ever... cut yourself again.
Do you understand?
Have I made that perfectly clear?
You' re over that now.
It' s in the past.
Yes.
Never again.
Now, you know what I want you to do?
I want you to leave work early.
You' re a big girl... a grown woman,... your mother doesn' t need to pick you up every day.
I want you to take a nice walk home,... in the fresh air, because you require relief.
Because you won' t be doing that anymore, will you?
No, sir.
Good.
Oh, it' s early.
I' m going to walk home from now on.
I took a shortcut through Hawkins Park,... and it was as if I' d never taken a walk by myself before.
I realized that I had probably never had taken a walk alone.
But because he had given me the permission to do this... because he' d insisted I do it, I felt held by him as I walked along.
I felt he was with me.
At the same time I was feeling something growing in Mr. Grey... an intimate tendril creeping from one of his darker areas,... nursed on the feeling that he had discovered something about me.
The next day I didn' t even bring my cuticle scissors and my iodine... but I did make another typing mistake.
What is wrong with you?
That is all you have to do... type and answer the phones.
Is that beyond you?
- It certainly seems to be.
- Don' t apologize to me.
What goes on inside that head of yours?
Come into my office and bring that letter.
Put the letter on my desk.
I want you to bend over the desk so you' re looking directly at it.
Get your face very close to the letter and read the letter aloud.
I don' t understand.
There' s nothing to understand.
Put your elbows on the desk... bend over... get your face close to the letter and read it aloud.
'Dear Mr. Garvey,...
I' m grateful to you for referring... '
Continue.
Ms. Holloway, read.
'... for referring me to your case.
The subject of animal captivity... has been of interest to me for quite a while,... and my secretary has prepared... research material... that I think you will find illuminating.
If you would be so kind... as to send me the June 5th Ietter of which we spoke,... my associates and I will review it immediately.
Please feel free to call me at your earliest convenience.
Yours sincerely, E. Edward Grey. '
Read it again.
'Dear Mr. Garvey...'
'I am grateful to you...'
'for referring me to your case.
The subject of animal captivity has been of interest to me... '
'... for quite a while.
And my secretary has prepared research material... that I think you will find illuminating. '
Now straighten yourself up and go type it again.
Good letter.
Mom?
The lock can come off the cabinet now.
Oh, honey.
120 watts.
Mr. Grey.
- Good to see you again, Mr. Garvey.
You remember my secretary, Ms. Holloway.
I' m sorry about the typo.
It' s porterhouse steak, mashed... no... creamed potatoes, green peas, iced tea and ice cream.
Okay.
Just a scoop of creamed potatoes... and a slice of butter.
Four peas... and as much ice cream as you like to eat.
'Cosmo' s' advice for 'getting your man... to share his feelings more intimately' is to first try some 'breezy humor.'
Whatever you do, don' t jump too quickly into 'relationship talk.'
I' m your secretary.
I' m your secretary.
Just one scoop of creamed potatoes, one slice of butter... oh... and four peas...
How many inches away was the furnace...?
Had you turned off the furnace before you went down into the basement?
Okay... maybe you didn' t squeeze it hard enough.
No, God no.
I haven' t had time to get to that.
I' m doing as much as I possibly can.
Where was she when you crawled under the house?
Did you cover it with dirt before you left?
Mud upstairs?
No, I' m confused by that.
Ah, but... this was the overweight child or your nephew from Baltimore?
On the banister.
I have to work.
Give me a week and I' il have something for you.
I' m sorry, the office has been... overwhelmed.
Mr. Grey, I' m going to go home now.
If you need any more typing done I could come back later.
Thank you, Ms. Holloway.
Good night.
That will be all.
Oh, here' s just one example.
He asked me out to Red Lobster the other night for a nightcap.
And yesterday he asked if my hose were control top... and if they were, I certainly didn' t need it.
Your boss?
You should sue him for sexual harassment.
I like that idea.
My lawyer is representing a woman who' s suing her boss for sexual harassment.
Is he a good lawyer?
He' s the best.
'He' s the best.'
- How long will he be there?
Who was that?
He checked himself into the hospital.
Yes, Lee?
I just wanted...
I needed you...
I wanted you to...
You need me to what?
I just wanted you to not forget to go over the Lynch papers for tomorrow.
No, I haven' t.
That' s good.
Thank you, Lee.
After he turned me away from his house,... he put me back at my old desk and he just stopped doing it.
He threw out all his red pens.
I kept making typos... but he just treated me like a regular old secretary.
Are you coming?
After a while I began to wonder if that was all I was.
Have we received any checks from Mr. Garvey?
No, sir.
File these.
That' s a pretty tie.
But I guess you won' t be golfing today.
What?
Your tie... it has golfers on it.
Right.
Damn it.
Don' t be scared.
I' m not.
That' s not what I meant.
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
Okay... but my clothes get to stay on and I want the lights out.
I didn' t hurt you, did I?
No.
Ms. Holloway?
Yes, Mr. Grey?
Come in to my office.
But Mr. Marvel is waiting.
Ms. Holloway, come in to my office.
Yes, sir.
Finally.
Ignore it.
Why?
You' re not worried that I' m going to fuck you, are you?
I' m not interested in that, not in the least.
Now pull up your skirt.
I said, pull up your skirt.
Peter?
I' m not going to be able to come to the diner today, okay?
Okay.
That' s okay, 'cause... it' s all right.
Pull down your pantyhose and underwear.
I told you I' m not going to fuck you.
Get these forms filled out.
And then you can take your lunch break.
Bring me my sandwich, I' m eating in.
And... go have the usual.
No mayonnaise this time.
And... send in what' s- his- name.
Mr. Grey.
Cock.
Place your prick in my mouth.
Screw me.
Fuck.
Orchid.
Oh, Mr. Grey...!
Edward.
Most people think that the best way to live is to run from pain.
But a much more joyful life... embraces the entire spectrum of human feeling.
If we can fully experience pain as well as pleasure,... we can live a much deeper and more meaningful life.
Ms. Holloway?
Yes, sir?
Okay.
What happened?
Are you pregnant?
No.
Do you plan on being pregnant?
- Could I...
You plan on getting pregnant?
No.
Are you living in an apartment?
A house.
Alone?
- With my parents.
Are you married?
No.
Are those your scores?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
- No, sir.
What?
No, sir.
Why?
It' s your behavior.
What about my behavior?
I' m sorry.
You can collect your things.
Time out.
- Time out?
You' re fired.
- You' re fired!
Now, Lee.
Get out!
Why did you get glue smear all over the Ramsey papers?
You saw me.
Are you aware you kick your shoes off under your desk?
Do you ever change your pantyhose?
Every day.
- Every time you erase... there are little shavings all over your desk.
I told you to take that Walkman home.
I don' t want the possibility of your listening to music... when you' re supposed to be working for me.
I know it' s there.
I' il move it.
You have to go or I won' t stop.
Don' t.
I cannot do this anymore.
But I want to know you.
I' m so sorry for what happened between us.
I realize what a terrible mistake I made with you.
And I can only hope that you understand.
Be assured you can count on me for excellent references.
Get out.
Get out.
What are you do...
- Get out!
I opened the envelope the second I got home.
It was a check for $680.
More than he actually owed me.
It occurred to me to tear up the check, but I didn' t.
I felt like I was doing the right thing.
And I didn' t tell anybody about any of it.
I pretended to go to work as usual,... and watched his office from across the street.
He hired a new girl and changed the locks on the doors.
There was just nothing for me to do about it.
So I decided it was time to meet someone new.
Hi.
Another guy kept ordering me to pee on his patio... and when I refused, he said...
- I thought you were a masochist.
- Thank you.
For a while I stopped trying and stayed at home... helping Dad adjust to his new sobriety.
Peter proposed marriage to me in the basement of J. C. Penney' s.
I think I said yes because I didn' t know what else to do.
I guess I was a little lighter than you in those days.
If you hold your breath through the wedding, you' il make it.
I' m going to get Stewart.
You' re beautiful, you' re just too beautiful.
No!
Where are you going?
- Lee.
I love you.
Lee, you should not be here.
I love you.
I' m sorry, I... but I don' t believe that to be true.
It is.
This matter was resolved... when I received your canceled severance check.
I love you.
We can' t do this 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Why not?
Put both your hands on the desk, palms down.
I want to make love.
Keep both your feet on the floor until I come back.
Hello?
- In case you' re wondering,... your fiancée is at my office.
Lee, I' m very fond of you as well...
Oh, it' s you.
Lee, what are you doing?
I don' t know how to deal with...
I' m sorry, I' m going to have to ask you to leave.
I' m your fiancé, Lee.
You are trespassing.
You are making an unwarranted incursion... a gradual or stealthy entrance into the sphere of another.
Okay, Lee... are you doing something... sexual, right now?
Does this look sexual to you?
I don' t know, Lee!
Why don' t you move your hands?
Because I don' t want to.
No!
Peter...
I don' t want you.
Now, get out.
Get out.
Get out!
I brought you some peas.
There are no statutes capable of controlling... the relations between men and women.
More conventional ways.
I expect that dress back, dry cleaned, in perfect condition.
I' m just going to leave you with this literature.
Why don' t you read about women' s struggle first?
You know, Lee,... there' s a long history of this in Catholicism.
The monks used to wear thorns on their temples.
And the nuns wore them sewn inside their clothing.
Two years ago when it didn' t work out between us, that was it.
I let him slip through my fingers.
You are part of a great tradition.
- I admire you, Ms. Holloway.
Without question, he is the most isolated man I' ve ever known.
The worm... amazing.
Who' s to say that love needs to be soft and gentle?
'You are the child of God' s holy gift of life.
You come from me, but you are not me.
Your soul and your body are your own,... and yours to do with as you wish. '
Thank you, Daddy.
Drinks.
Take what you ordered.
What you ordered.
We are here on day three of what has come to be known... as the 'Lee Holloway Hunger Strike.'
You may have heard... that there are those in the community who wonder... if Ms. Holloway is even willing to starve herself to death.
I didn' t know why, exactly.
But I do know that I' m not so scared of suffering now.
I feeI more than I' ve ever felt,... and I' ve found someone to feel with, to play with, to love,... in a way that feels right for me.
I hope he knows that I can see that he suffers too,... and that I want to love him. '
Each cut, each scar, each burn, a different mood or time.
I told him what the first one was.
I remembered them all.
And for the first time in my life, I felt beautiful.
Finally part of the earth.
I touched the soil and he loved me back.
Where did you go to high school?
What was your mother like?
What was her name?
What did it say... under your senior yearbook picture?
Who was your first Iove?
When did your heart... first get broken?
Where were you born?
Des Moines, Iowa.
All our activities melted into an everyday sort of life... until we looked like any other couple you' d see.
Pull it over, yes.
Just pull it tight.
Now these pillows like to be stacked...
largest to the smallest.
We had a June wedding, by ourselves, at the justice of the peace.
Then we honeymooned in the mountains.
We only had the weekend, because Edward had to get back to work.
SOMEWHERE IN WHAT WAS ONCE THE SOVlETUNlON
- Hi.
- Hi, come in.

How come you decided to go to America?
Mom met her boyfriend through one of those dating agencies.
He' s Russian, but he Iives in America.
It' s incredible!

- You' re going to Iive in another flat.
This flat' s too big for you.
I told you to get dressed.
- I' m not going. This is my flat!
- You must obey me.
Let' s go.
Here it is.
The old man that Iived here died a few weeks ago. These are his things.

- Yes, you wiIl.
As Iong as your mother isn' t here, I decide.
Everything' s here: fridge, windows, it' s warm...

If you don' t want to Iive here, Iive on the street.

VOLODYA
Our Father, who art in heaven.
HaIlowed be thy Name.
On earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses.
As we forgive those that trespass against us.
And Iead us not in to temptation, but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.
Very good.
You could do better.
I thought you' d gone to America.
You did reaIly weII in the test.
- A golden future awaits you.
- What?
I was kidding.
Go to heIl, bitch!
You can be sure I have a golden future ahead of me.
HeIlo!
Where are you going?

What doesn' t make any difference to me?
I told dad that it was your money.

He probably just wanted to sleep with my mom.
Then she got pregnant and he moved to Moscow.
She wrote to him, but he didn' t answer.
I' ve never seen him.
Come on, I' m freezing.

Everyone stands up. "

It' s Iike Iying in a coffin.
Let' s pretend we' re dead.

What do you think happens when someone dies?
Does he go to paradise, to God and Jesus and aII of that?

I think you become an angeI in heaven.
You can play basketbaII aII day Iong and score as many points as you Iike.
And be a miIlion times better than MichaeI Jordan.
That' s buIlshit...
That' s not the only thing you can do there.
Dance, play computer games, go to parties...

SUMMONS TO SOClAL WELFARE
So you' ve had no contact with your mother since she moved to America?
- No.
- And she hasn' t caIled?
I don' t have a telephone.
- She hasn' t written?
- No.
We' ve received a Ietter from her.
Do you know anything about this?
No. Why?
In the Ietter she writes...
You can' t formaIly do this...
But she writes that she renounces her parenthood.
This means that she no Ionger wishes to be your guardian.
What are you talking about?
Look, I reaIly feeI sorry for you, but here she writes...
- "and therefore I no Ionger wish to be her guardian."
"I here by hand her over to the care of the SociaI Services."
It' s awful.
And cigarettes, please.
That' II be 160, 40.

In a week.

You can come with me.
I can get a job and a flat for you there.
It' d be cool...
Haven' t you ever thought of Ieaving here?
This country is shit.
There' s nothing to do here.
Sweden is a paradise compared to here. You can reaIly relax there.
And the people...
Even the people are different.
They' re kind, not Iike here.
Besides, you can earn reaIly good money.
You know, in one month you can earn what a doctor makes here in a year.
- That can' t be true!
- Yes it is, reaIly!
Look at it here...
People are crazy!
You know what my cousin did?
He sold one of his kidneys because he didn' t have money.
Would you seII a kidney?
You don' t deserve a Iife Iike that.
- What happened to the baIl?
- Dad broke it.
- Broke it?
- Just punctured it.
- Why?
- With scissors.
- Why?
- I don' t know.
He went crazy.
I' II fix it...
Open up!
It' s the police!
Is it reaIly the police?
Open or we' il break the door down!
How are things?
- What do you want?
- Come here!
- What do you want?
- Get out!
- Stop it!
I don' t give a shit about them.
I' m getting out of here soon anyway.
You want some glue?
- You know what?
- No.
I' m going to get you a job in Sweden.
ReaIly, I swear.
I don' t want to Ieave you here alone.
I' II talk to Andrei.
I' m so glad you' re coming to Sweden.
We' II get a reaIly big flat... with an enormous bathroom...
Everything you want.
There' s something I want to ask you.
I have a friend and I wanted to ask you whether...
We' II talk about it Iater.
- You' re stupid.
- I' m stupid?
- You' re stupid.
- I' m stupid?
- Yes, you are!
- You can Ieave if I' m stupid.
- And why am I stupid?
- 'Cause that guy' s tricking you.
- Tricking me?
- Yes, he reaIly is...
- No way!
- Course he is.
In what way?
He talks about jobs in Sweden, but he just wants to sleep with you.
- In reality, there' II be no job.
- Course there wiII be!
I promise I' II get you a job in Sweden.
I' II talk to Andrei.
Haven' t you talked to him yet?
- I forgot.
- You said you' d talk to him.
Sorry, I forgot!
I' II talk to him, I promise.
- Were you doing something else?
- Stop it, I' II talk to him.
- What job is it?
- Something with vegetables.
- Vegetables?
- Picking them or something...
In winter?
Vegetables don' t growin winter.
So?
Maybe it' s warmer in Sweden.
- You know where Sweden is?
- Roughly.
- Where?
- I don' t know exactly...... but somewhere in the EU... or whatever it' s caIled.
And you, what do you know?.!
- You' re just jealous.
- Of him?
Jealous?
No.
- You' re jealous. Yes, you are.
- Course you are.
- No...
- No.
Course I' m not.
- Is it for me?
- Yes, who else?
- What is it?
- Open it, you' II see.
A passport?
- Look at the Iast page.
- What' s there?
Now your name is Katya.
- Why?
- There could be problems at the border.
You' re not 18 yet.
It' s so they won' t ask unneccessary questions.
By the way, I rang my boss.
He said you could start on Monday.
- Monday?
This Monday?
- Yes, this Monday.
We go on Sunday.
I have... to ask you something.
Could you get a job for another person?
I don' tk now.
It' s for my friend, a friend that means a Iot to me.

It might be the Iast time I see her.

The houses, cars, streets, the wind... it' s aII yours.
You can do what you Iike.
Sorry, but I' m not sure it' s a good present.
It' s windy...... there' s a mist.
And this world isn' t that good.
Now I' m jumping... and flying...
No, you can' t...
Why not?
It' s up to me.
I' ve had it with this Iife.
It' s complete shit.
- No, it' s not.
It' s shit.
- No, it' s not.
- Course it is.
But it' s the only one you' ve got.
This Iife is the only one you' ve got.
I don' t want this Iife.
I' m not interested.
Look at me.
I kiIled myself and went to heaven and yeah, it' s reaIly good in heaven.
But I regret it, 'cause I wanted to Iive on earth a Iittle Ionger.
You remain dead for aII eternity, but you' re alive only for a brief moment.
- I wasn' t ready yet.
- Not ready?
- and you wrote "Lilya 4- ever"?
And those assholes that spat at us?
I said that we should Ieave -
- but you said that you weren' t ready.
You wanted to finish writing first.
Do you remember?
That' s how it is now.
Everyone' s spitting at you, but you' re not ready.
Jump if you want.
It' s not dangerous.
I' II catch you.
But then you Iose. And the assholes that spit at you win. You see?
HeIlo, sweetheart.

Have you got homework?
How was schooI today?
I hate you.
You think I' m your property?

You can' t.
You can' t buy my heart and soul.
Stop!
Stop goddammit!
Mom...

Girl, about 16 years old.
FaII from a height.
One, two, three...
GeneraI circulatory arrest.
No further details. Within five minutes.
Can I touch you?
Are you real?!
You' re real!
I' m not going. You don' t pick vegetables in the winter, I' m no fool.
Bye!
You dropped your potatoes.
Let me help you.
This film is dedicated to the miIlions of children around the world exploited by the sex trade.
I' il be right back with your order.
Pancakes, side of bacon.
Who' s dying?
Come on, pick it up.
Phil, Big Papa, please?
I need 15.
I love it when you call me Big Papa.
Hey, you' re up early today.
Okay, you' re good to go.
Does that line ever work?
What' s the problem here?
It' s hot!
Sorry.
Why not?
My grandfather was a lawyer.
Plus, I have a logical mind.
And you' re only, like, what? $299, 000 short of what you need for law school?
- Piece of cake.
- Piece of pie.
Piece of ass.
So what would you do?
- I don' t know.
- Liar.
You know, I was thinking I could go back to school full- time.
And quit here?
I won' t allow it, Slim.
- Sorry, sir.
- What?
It' s the deodorant thing.
It' s like salts or something.
You rub it on your pits.
It looks like some kind of hippie crystal.
- No, you just....
- No.
God....
- Okay.
Your turn.
I' m sweating too much.
You waiting for somebody?
- Something to drink?
- Just water, thanks.
I' il give you a minute to look at the menu.
That' s okay.
I was in here yesterday, Slim.
- What' s your real name?
- No.
I like it.
Don' t you think it' s kind of negative, though?
No, I don' t tell my name.
Give me the soup, turkey burger, coleslaw, couple of extra slices of tomato.
Do you read books?
What are you reading now?
You know Finnegans Wake by James Joyce?
My friend told me it' s the hardest book in the English language.
I mean, not the hardest, but the hardest one that you can actually read.
I thought to myself, if I can get through it, I could probably read the rest.
- How long have you been reading it?
- Six years.
I' il be back with your soup.
- He likes you.
- He' s a dick.
- I know.
Now he' s back today, he brought a rose, he pulls you into conversation.
Okay, so he likes me.
- So, do you like him?
- I don' t know him.
What' s that got to do with anything?
He' s a major piece of cake, piece of pie.
Trust me, okay?
He' s carrot cake.
And when a guy like that, who' s actually cuter than you, likes you....
He' s cuter than me?
Face it, no one will ever go for you because of your looks.
That sucks, because my personality bites.
Cup of soup.
You don' t really write books, do you?
No.
I haven' t really been reading Finnegans Wake either.
I' m going into law...... enforcement.
Who' s the rose for?
Enjoy your grub.
You.
How much did you settle on?
Excuse me?
The bet.
How much is it?
You and your friend, yesterday, was it $200?
Was it $500?
What was it?
What?
He bet his friend...... that he could get into your pants by noon tomorrow.
Is this your business?
Are you the morals police?
I was just having some fun.
What was it? $200 or $500?
I want to know what I' m worth.
The bet was for $200.
But now that I know you...... way too high.
Don' t come back here again...... ever.
I' m sorry to get in your business.
Thanks.
I can' t believe you actually said something.
I' d have felt bad about it...... if I' d have kept quiet.
Good luck.
Please tell me, Phil, as Mitch was rather vague...... is her father dead, too?
Well, he is to her.
He left when she was maybe two or three.
- Then I' m happy to pay for the wedding.
- Yes, we' re very happy.
You sure you love me?
Forever and ever?
You' re safe with me, Slim.
You' re safe, and it' s okay to be happy.
We deserve it.
- Wait, so this was during or after college?
- During.
What' s wrong with you?
No, I mean, why did you and Slim break up?
I' m terrible in bed.
Plus, she had to drop out, some money problems...... and so we kind of evolved into being friends.
Can I take you home right now?
If you' ve got a sense of humor.
My kids are out for tonight --
I live in Seattle.
Women always want the possibility of long- term.
I didn' t just propose.
I just thought that maybe we could...... have a brief, totally unsatisfying sexual encounter.
I' m your guy.
Excuse me, I' m sorry, I' m sorry...... but I' ve got to get up at 5: 00 in the morning to buy green beans.
Now...... l know you don' t need it, but it' s tradition in my family...
-... to give money to the groom.
- That' s sweet.
Thank you, Phil.
And thank you for giving me away today.
You' re the best substitute father a girl ever had.
No substitute.
I' m the real thing.
Thank you.
He really loves you.
You gonna give me babies, Slim?
How soon?
How soon can we get out of here?
We' ve been driving around...... and my wife has fallen completely in love with your house.
Yes, it' s great, isn' t it?
We want to buy it.
She wants it for our family.
We' re not selling.
- Sure you are.
That' s the price.
Don' t worry, it' s well over market.
- You' re out of your mind.
- I know, that' s just it.
So before you say no again...... think how miserable one determined, crazy person can make you.
Miserable today, tomorrow, pretty much every day, until the day you sell.
Your kids are grown, you' il be happier in a smaller place.
Parker, how are you?
How' s the jump shot?
- Not now, sweetie.
- It' s Slim.
Yeah?
What?
Parker, give me a ride to the hospital.
Look after the client.
She looks just like my baby pictures.
Don' t you?
Who was that?
Who cares?
Some construction thing.
Let me see.
That' s my baby, that' s my baby.
Let' s put it out here.
What' s that one?
Should I join you?
I' m about to get out.
I got to go back to work.
- Yeah.
Me, too.
Hi, darling.
Where are you?
You just paged my husband, right?
Oh, my God.
Who are you?
What' s your name?
I' m so sorry, l --
No, it' s too late to deny it now.
- Your name?
- I have to go.
Don' t hang up.
Don' t be a coward.
Just tell me your name.
That' s the least you could do, don' t you think?
I' m Darcelle.
I' m very sorry.
She paged you.
Who?
Number 33.
Darcelle.
I guess you' re late.
She' s French?
- No?
- Yeah.
And Gracie.
I must be brain- dead.
I must be the biggest moron on the planet because I thought we were happy.
Were we happy?
And I used to think we were so lucky.
And I thought in bed we were still....
- No.
- You said I was safe with you.
- You are.
I promise.
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
Everything is going to be okay.
- What?
Her perfume.
- Darcelle, or whoever.
- We just had a drink.
Stop it!
You' re caught!
I caught you!
And you won' t talk your way out of this.
How many, Mitch?
How many are there?
How many have there been?
What does it matter?
It' s not that our sex life hasn' t been good.
But I' m a man.
Men and women have different needs...... and that' s okay.
She' s willing to take care of that, and maybe that' s better for everybody.
It' s better for you!
You have a pretty good deal, don' t you?
I sit here, take care of your house and kid.
Well, no more, Mitch!
The party is over!
- Calm down.
- I won' t do this anymore.
I won' t sit here and take it, and take it, and take it.
Sorry!
I love you, yes.
I' m your wife.
I' m your wife.
You cannot do this to me anymore.
What?
I can' t hit you?
No, you can' t.
You want to fight?
I' m a man, honey, it' s no contest.
You have to understand, and I thought you did.
It' s my rules.
You' re with me?
It' s your rules.
- And what if I don' t like the rules?
- If you don' t like them?
Come on, sweetie, life isn' t just stuff we like, is it?
We have to take the good with the bad.
That' s what marriage is.
So, for you, maybe today is a bad day.
Tomorrow may be great.
Tomorrow will be great.
Today...... is the price you pay for having such a good life.
I' m going to go out.
This will be better, don' t you think?
I can say:
"I' m going to Darcelle' s.
I' il be back in a few hours. "
Okay?
Who are you calling?
Your mother.
What will you tell her?
I was supposed to bring Gracie by tomorrow, so I better cancel.
You know, love is a scary thing.
How powerful it is, what it does to you.
That is what happened here.
See, if I ever think of....
I can' t....
I refuse to live without you.
I think you understand what I' m saying.
Hey, you' re late.
You are late.
I was worried you weren' t coming at all.
No Gracie?
We will have a regular girls' luncheon...... and we will gossip about absolutely everybody.
My poor baby.
My God.
Honey, I am so sorry.
What did you do?
What did you say to him?
Men are like land mines.
Some you trigger the first week, others it' s years in.
The problem is you want a man- man.
Meaning his veins run thick with testosterone, which is good.
But then he can turn around without any warning and...... hit you.
I' m not this person.
I' m not a person whose husband beats her up.
I know.
What do I do?
You got to go to the cops.
He' s the father of my child, okay?
I will not put him in jail!
Hold on.
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry, okay?
Sit down.
Relax for a second.
I' m just saying that either you endure this...... and you live it out like you' re in some goddamn country western song...... or you take the kid, you take Gracie and you get out.
Mrs. Hiller, how are you?
Your husband got her.
I must' ve forgotten.
Gracie was totally psyched.
I told him he should do it more often.
Gracie!
Is that my little croissant?
No, it' s your loaf of bread.
How is it going?
- Where are you?
- Why didn' t you tell me -- - I called you at home, left messages.
- It' s your mom, honey.
Mom, the elephants are peeing.
She' s a little excited.
Come here.
Look at the giraffe.
So, when are you guys going to be home?
I don' t know.
I' il take her for a pony ride, maybe get a cotton candy.
You want a cotton candy, honey?
- 'Bye, Mommy.
Made me nervous when I couldn' t reach you today.
I thought you were going to cancel with my mother.
And you have to go crying to the old gang at the greasy spoon.
Whatever happened to privacy?
I guess it' s dead, along with chivalry and fidelity.
Tell me.
Do you have any idea...... how bad things can get?
Educate me.
Slim, I' m a determined man.
I was determined to have you, and I did.
This house, my company....
I am and always will be a person who gets what he wants.
And I still want you.
You can either accept that...... or you can fight it.
I want to be happy.
Good.
- Yeah.
I have a friend whose husband beats her up.
She should come in here and file a complaint.
If she has physical evidence of abuse on her person...... we' il go out and arrest him.
- If he has money, he can bail himself out.
- That' s true.
- Then he' s free till it goes to trial.
- If it goes to trial.
It' s up to the city' s attorney' s office whether to prosecute.
Okay, so...... she comes in here, she has him arrested...... and pisses him off...... then there' s no guarantee that he won' t come after her once he' s out.
She could get a protection order.
A little piece of paper that says he can' t come around?
And when he comes around, what does she do, throw it at him?
She calls us.
And what about the kid? ls the....
- Is the paper good for the kid, too?
- There' s a child involved?
That' s a matter for the family courts.
But unless she can prove that he' s a danger to the child...... she can' t legally bar him access.
- Maybe she didn' t hear the signal.
- No, she heard it.
I think maybe Teddy is right.
Maybe she could still be sleeping.
She' s not sleeping, okay, Phil?
She' s coming any second.
Okay, do it again.
Put her down.
We should go in.
It' d be crazy if we woke him up.
Plus, she' s going to flick the lights if anything is wrong.
- Yeah.
Another step and you' re dead.
You don' t understand.
You' ve broken into our house.
She' s alive.
The lights are out.
I could kill you free and clear.
- Where' s Gracie?
- She' s here.
We are happy to leave, Mitch, with Slim and Miss Gracie.
And make no mistake.
If you keep them here, we will go straight to the police...... who will surely arrest you with a great deal of pleasure.
I don' t want to say this in front of the group...... but you are just a rug head.
If you go to the cops, it will be her word against mine.
And they will find drugs in her bureau or her car, or whatever.
Trust me on that.
I' il have custody of Gracie by the end of the week.
I got to get her out of here.
Enough with her.
Get out.
Wake up, baby.
Wake up.
Look at your papa.
We' re going for a little ride.
Look at your papa.
Help them up.
Get the bag.
- I' il see you soon.
'Bye, sweetie.
And she' s tied up because...... once a mean guy got her, tied her up....
Could be a broken rib.
At least it' s not my face this time.
Where are we going?
- Hospital.
- I' m fine.
- You are not.
- Where to, Phil?
- Hospital.
I don' t want to take her to the ER in the middle of the night.
She needs someplace safe where she can sleep.
We could go to my house.
He knows where you live.
He knows where we all live.
- One queen- size bed is all right?
- Yeah, it' s just me and my daughter.
This card has been refused.
Would you like to try another?
The funds in your account seem to be frozen.
- I love motels.
- Me, too.
- Hotels, too.
- Yeah, more potato.
- I' m going to bounce on the bed.
Be careful.
- What?
I' m talking to Gracie.
We' re watching some TV, getting ready to hit the sack.
Look, Mom.
- What about what we talked about?
No shelters.
She hasn' t been tainted by anything so far...
-... and I want to keep it that way.
I understand.
- Can we talk about this tomorrow?
- Piece of cake.
Piece of pie.
Ready for bed.
What' s "tainted"? ls that like "painted"?
- Gin, I said tomorrow, okay?
- Not exactly the Biltmore, is it?
It' s the information age, sweetheart.
You leave a trail everywhere.
Especially when your best friend rents your room with her credit card.
I had to do that since someone froze all my accounts, right?
- We need to talk.
- No, we don' t.
Please.
If we do this the hard way, you know who will suffer.
I' m not talking about you, honey.
I mean Gracie.
You don' t want her touched or affected by something bad or undesirable.
- "Tainted," right?
That' s what tainted means.
- Who' s banging on the door?
- I don' t know.
What' s going on?
- Mom, I' m scared.
- It will be okay, baby.
Hold the bus!
Hold the bus!
Go, go, go!
Open it.
That fare is $409 round trip.
How would you like to pay for that?
Cash.
I always thought you' d come back here with me, but not eight years later.
Well, if I had known how pretty it was....
This place really sparkles!
You know what they call it?
The Emerald City.
Isn' t that where Dorothy is?
No, sweetie, that' s where Dorothy goes in her dream.
Where is she when she wakes up?
Back in Kansas.
- All right, game time.
Duck your heads.
- Pigeon poop.
Why did you come to me?
I tried to think of the last time that I felt safe.
Then I saw your face.
And, I wanted a place that...... M- l- T- C- H wouldn' t think of.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- FBl.
Can we talk?
- Go ahead.
Would you mind opening up?
I' m investigating a kidnapping.
I' d like to look around.
You got a warrant?
- You letting us in or not?
- Hold on a second.
Can I see the warrant?
Watch the front.
Who are you looking for?
Mister, unless you leave right now, I' m calling the police.
Jeez, that' s a scary thought.
I don' t need their bullshit right now.
That' s enough.
Now!
You' re not FBl, okay.
I know who hired you.
Do you know what it' s like to have a knife hit your carotid?
Do you know what it' s like to die because you' re really stupid?
No, I really don' t.
John boy.
This is not listed on the program.
They' re not here.
Let' s ride.
- Can' t I just -- - No!
Not today.
Your phone.
'Night, John boy.
- Are you okay?
I needed a shave anyway.
I' m sorry.
- I shouldn' t be here.
- Sure you should.
- I can' t keep putting people I love in danger.
They killed my sofa.
This is Mitch Hiller.
It' s him.
How are you?
I assume Slim' s called you?
Of course.
Could you give her a message?
- If she calls back again, I mean?
- I don' t know.
I' m on her side, not yours.
Her side.
Really?
Come on, Joe.
You' re a smart guy.
Let me say two words to you, okay?
Lug nuts.
You don' t want to worry they are loose every time you pull on the freeway.
Are they still locked?
Person could go crazy thinking about stuff like that.
- You think those thugs are coming back?
- It doesn' t make any difference.
Sure it does.
You don' t have to go.
They' re not coming back tonight.
You know that it is not safe for you if I stay here.
You can come back any time.
Tomorrow, the next day.
Maybe I' il take you up on that one day.
Where will you go?
What will you do?
She insists on seeing you.
I haven' t had sex since 1995.
Not in this country, at least.
Not her.
Me.
I' m your daughter.
- What year were you born?
- You are my father, Jupiter.
I wrote you, like, 20 times.
But even when Mom died you didn' t answer.
- I didn' t have enough money to bury her.
I didn' t kill her.
No.
You had help.
That' s a stupid thing to say.
What do you want?
Money?
I wanted Gracie to meet her grandpa.
And, yes, we need money to survive.
Look, sweetheart...... from 1968- 1972, I had five kids.
Maybe more.
It' s a running joke around here.
How will you feel when you wake up one day and find out your daughter is dead?
And you didn' t do anything to help?
You' re good.
The kid' s a sweet touch, too.
But you' re not the first to think of this gig since that Fortune article.
So I' il give you the same thing I gave the other three. $6.
Enough to buy a sandwich.
But for you, I' il make it $12.
Make sure you buy the kid a sandwich, too.
I believe this originally belonged to you.
Pawn it, since you' re so hard up.
I' m sure it' s worth more than $12.
Mommy, don' t cry.
Please don' t cry.
This way.
This is the best we can do.
We' re fine.
Thanks.
Who are all these people?
They' re kind of friends of friends of Phil.
What is it?
It' s food, okay?
Hi, I lost my birth certificate.
Phil sent it.
Are you surprised?
All right?
Dear Slim:
Yesterday three men threatened to kill me if I helped you in any way.
Fortunately for you, this aroused my interest.
I' m sending this to an old address, the diner where you worked.
If this reaches you and you need more...... leave word at my office.
Jupiter.
What do we think?
We like it here?
- No.
We just --
Good.
Because I' m sick and tired to death of moving.
Me, too.
So here' s the deal.
You can call me Mom or you can call me Erin, but you cannot call me Slim.
I never call you Slim.
I know, but just in case somebody asks you someday --
I don' t think you are that slim.
Thanks a lot.
- Do I get a new name, too?
If you want one.
- Excuse me!
- Yes?
I called you.
- Yes, I remember.
This is my daughter.
You are so....
What' s your name?
Queen Elizabeth.
Welcome, Queen Elizabeth.
You' il have a good time here.
May I call you "Queen" for short?
I like talking to Grandma, but every Sunday...... do we have to drive for 55 hours...... just to reach some phone booth?
- Can I call Daddy this time?
- No.
Please?
You look like a dog.
You know he has friends in the police department...... and you' re depriving him of his rights as a father, nonsense like that.
It' s leading up to a big custody hearing.
What are you saying?
Calm him down.
Call him before he does something stupid.
It might help if he talked to Gracie...... for her sake, too.
It' s not healthy to be without a father.
I' il call you next week.
I want to speak to Gracie --
Hi, Daddy.
We' re having a great vacation.
Where?
We' ve been everywhere.
Chicago and --
Or it ends now.
Listen, bitch.
Don' t tell me how I can talk to her.
Put me back on the phone with Gracie.
Give her the damn phone.
Tell Daddy that you love him and say goodbye.
Gracie, you there, honey?
Sweetheart, talk to me.
'Bye, Daddy.
Daddy didn' t mean to use bad words.
- Graciel
I' m sorry, kid.
It was my mistake.
Mommy' s just a big dummy.
What do you think?
- Her voice?
- Yeah, she sounds the same.
'Cause if she' s changed her appearance --
I remember her.
I told you.
The scam.
I don' t remember why you broke the rules and decided to marry the bitch.
She' s not a bitch.
Sorry.
She is a waitress.
- What does that mean?
- Means she' s stupid.
Now to call you.
- She' s not stupid.
She thinks if the calls are short they can' t be traced.
With all the girls that we pulled that on, why her?
Maybe it' s love.
I know what that means.
If you were smart, you' d forget her.
I can' t simply forget her.
She kidnapped my kid.
It' s not kidnapping.
Kidnapping is when someone who isn' t the mother takes the kid.
When the mother takes the kid, it' s called parenting.
How soon can you get there?
I don' t know.
You know, I could lose my job for this.
Robbie...... you could lose your job for all the jobs you' re doing besides doing your job.
- You know what I mean?
- You got to be reasonable.
- I know some guys in Detroit.
- Like your guys in Seattle?
I know what they' re like.
They' ve never met her, never heard her voice.
She' il spot them and run before they even see her.
It' s you, Robbie.
It' s you...... or it' s you.
What do you think? ls it okay?
It' s okay, right?
It' s horrible.
It' s not horrible, Mom.
Yeah, but it' s not good, is it?
Mom, you tasted it.
You know what I think?
I think you miss Daddy.
Daddy yells at me, toots.
Well, you miss somebody.
There he is.
Joe, over here!
You' re lucky I like you.
This is the most preposterous trip I' ve ever taken.
You guys hungry as I am?
- Yeah.
You okay?
Cut off from everybody, can' t talk to your friends....
Gracie is safe.
- When is this custody thing?
- Couple of months.
Anyway, they favor the mother, so....
Yeah, they do.
But he has a lot of money, and a lot of lawyers.
That' s kind of what I mean.
I mean, you can' t run forever, Slim.
Why not?
I' m good at it.
You are.
But, then again, you' re good at everything.
Wait, I' m confused.
Are you criticizing me or flirting with me?
Let me get back to you on that.
- Hi, Gracie.
- Yes.
You want to see a trick?
I don' t hear the basketball.
Gracie!
I mean, Queen!
Watch my new trick!
Didn' t I tell you to stay close?
Do you remember the house rules?
Who can forget, with Gracie here?
- What would have happened if we -- - Don' t.
It' s wrong to think like that.
- Why?
- Because of Gracie.
She' s truly a great kid.
Any path that doesn' t include her doesn' t make any sense.
Ginny told me about that weekend.
Of your wedding?
Did she tell you how terrible I was?
Joe, that might work with other people, but you forget.
I' ve had you.
I didn' t forget.
And I' m telling you from experience...... you' re not that bad.
- Yeah.
Why?
Why can' t you quit your job and come here...... and play the horses, and become independently wealthy?
Please, kiss me, Slim.
I know we' re not supposed to, and it' s against house rules.
But for me to come all this way and feel the way I do --
You' re a great person, Slim.
You' re a great person.
Just like your daughter.
Can I get a chocolate kiss?
- Who wants to put two eggs in.
- I want to put the eggs.
Careful.
I want you back.
- It could be just like it was.
- No!
That' s pretty stupid.
You know why?
Because if I can' t have you, nobody will.
Like that jerk who was here with you.
He' il be fishing for his guts.
For murder, they need a body.
Otherwise, they' il think you ran away again.
Only this time, you' il never come back.
Mommy!
Daddy, no!
Get in the back.
Strap yourself in.
Put that on.
Mommy, what' s happening?
Put it on.
Put these on, too.
Car seat, honey.
- Then slow so I can.
- I can' t slow down right now.
Bitch!
Pull over.
Mommy, stop it!
Hold on tight.
Pull over.
- Hold on, Gracie, okay.
It will be over soon.
Just hold on, okay?
Let' s talk.
You want me to tell you what happened?
Fair enough.
First thing...... Erin is over.
I liked Erin.
And you are not the Queen of England anymore.
Okay?
I' m hungry.
- Is everything okay here?
- Yeah, thanks.
What' s your name?
I don' t know.
Come on.
You' il be okay?
Okay?
Don' t talk to any strangers.
Be right back.
- Is Mr. Toller with someone?
I swear.
- Wait a minute.
You can' t -- - Don' t call security.
Hi, Mr. Toller.
I mean, my name is Slim.
Down at the diner, right down the block.
The thing is....
See?
I need someone to talk to who is smart.
And I have money, you know.
I have money. $500.
And you can have it.
You can have it all...... if you just listen to what....
Two minutes.
Please.
Thanks.
Small person.
Thank you.
Pardon my French, dear, but...... l hope you got some pleasure from it because you' ve really screwed yourself.
You had two chances to go to the police, file a complaint...... put his violence on record.
You ignored them both.
Which tells him to keep on coming until he kills you.
As for Gracie, you' re going to the custody hearing?
If you didn' t, the judge would rule against you, and you' d become a fugitive.
Once you' re there, your husband will, as you say, portray you as a drug addict.
For all I know, you are one.
You break in here uninvited.
I' d say your attacker has a very good chance of gaining sole custody.
Take it.
Is that it?
You won' t help me?
That' s what I' m telling you.
It' s too late.
There isn' t anybody who can help you.
In good conscience, I should say...... the custody hearing is probably a trick.
It' s a way to find you.
A way to get you in a particular place and time so his men can follow you...... and he can come to wherever you are...... and kill you.
Now I got to make you a promise, Grace.
Ever since you were born....
One day I started thinking of all the awful things that could happen.
People who you' d love would die...... or leave you, or betray you...... and break your heart.
Or a guy would hurt you in some way.
And I thought to myself, if I could...... protect you from that, even once.
If I could just...... absorb any of that myself.
Here goes.
This is really busy here.
Would you hold her hand, please?
This is the most ridiculous thing I' ve ever done.
- Oh, yeah?
How about Horace?
- Okay, the second most.
Rent a car, drive to Reno, then fly to San Jose.
- Are you out of your mind?
- You noticed?
I thought I' m supposed to drive to Reno.
I had to make sure you weren' t followed.
How are you?
- Okay.
Some cash and credit cards.
It' s on me.
- Just don' t call home.
- Okay.
Think of it as a paid vacation you never had.
Hey, toots.
You want to give Mommy a hug?
Come here.
Okay?
I' m going to miss you.
It' s just for a little while.
A little kiss?
Can I have a little smile before you go?
Okay.
Sweetie, why don' t you sit up front, okay?
Take care of her.
I don' t want you to worry, okay?
Eric will have her dribbling behind her back the next time you see her.
Thanks.
I' m number 1 on the auto dialer.
Call me, or I' il call you.
All calls, 15 seconds or less.
- Cake?
- Pie.
Try to have fun.
Hey, how long?
The custody hearing is in the next month, so....
- That' s my deadline.
- Deadline for what?
Relax.
Close your eyes.
I' m not here.
He' s not here.
Time!
Breathe.
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
That' s it.
Go!
Relax.
Keep your balance.
- You ready?
- Yes.
You sure?
- Can you lose?
- No.
- Can he hurt you?
- No.
- Even though he' s bigger?
- He' s a lot bigger.
- Even though he' s stronger?
- He' s a lot stronger.
Get some rest tonight.
Tomorrow we' re gonna work on the ball.
Look at me!
- If he hits you....
- No way.
Say it.
It takes twice as much energy to swing and miss as to swing and hit.
You think you' re done for.
Left arm up.
Drop that arm.
Good.
So how do you win?
How?
I attack.
- And what do you do after you attack?
- Nothing.
Why nothing?
Because I never stop attacking.
Good!
Use your legs.
Keep that chin down!
That' s it!
Go!
One last thing.
The hardest lesson.
We can' t control the universe.
Suddenly the maid enters.
You' re distracted for an instant and he hits you.
That' s not possible.
To win, we must prepare, even for the impossible.
We bend the universe to our will, but it will only go so far.
- So you' re saying....
- Yes.
You' re down.
Lying there.
Seemingly beaten.
But hear me.
Hold on to my voice.
He' s standing over you.
He thinks he' s won.
And as sure as he' s a coward, he will try to kick you.
Yes.
But because you know what he' il do...... you' re smiling inside.
- How' s that guy I set you up with?
- He' s good.
- He teach you how to think?
- I hope so.
Did you find Mitch?
Bought a place out near the marina.
I need a woman who looks like me.
5' 5 ", 115 pounds.
An off- duty cop or something.
She should have her hair cut short, too.
- She should wear jeans and sneakers.
- Here' s his address.
I got her a room at the Washington Square lnn.
What' s she for?
I need Mitch to think I' m here, in San Francisco.
Have her meet me, 5: 45, top floor of the Vesuvio' s.
Today?
Well, that' s awful short notice.
I don' t know --
I thought Jupiter was almighty, powerful, king of the gods.
One more thing.
At some point, not right now because it would be phony...... l need you to acknowledge I' m your kid.
- You sure this will work?
- You bet your life.
I will.
- And where is Gracie?
- Well, she gets back the day after tomorrow.
And then we' re gonna fly to LA.
Why is this call different?
Well, you know, we were in the country then.
Now we' re in the city, meeting with my lawyers.
So, you know, there' s lots of cell phones here.
So, there' s no way they can trace this.
Make sure you call me the minute you get back.
I can' t wait to see my girls, okay?
- Coffee?
Change for work.
I' il call you.
You want my number?
Sure.
- Thanks, for everything.
- You, too.
I really appreciate it.
Really.
Lucy.
Hey, baby.
No, I had to work late.
I have a flight to San Francisco early tomorrow morning.
If it was pleasure, you' d be going, too.
No, I have to go up and pick up my daughter.
Yeah, the custody hearing is down here.
But it looks as if Gracie is being taken to San Francisco...... and my wife...... it seems as if she has completely vanished.
Right off the face of the earth.
I doubt they' il ever find her this time.
I want her to meet you, too.
We' il call you as soon as we get back.
'Bye.
What' s up?
- I' m in.
Thanks for letting me come talk about Gracie.
I' m glad you' re willing to admit your temper.
The physical abuse you subjected me to.
Perhaps with your new attitude, we can really work something out.
Per your last letter, I' il see you the evening of....
You okay?
Say it again.
Say what?
You know, what you told me.
You have a divine, animal right...... to protect your own life and the life of your offspring.
Are you still there?
I want to see if this works.
It' s me.
And this morning?
You always did forget to turn off the coffee.
I found it, Mitch.
It' s a machine.
It knocks out cell phones.
Found that gun, too.
- Scared?
- Of what?
Whether you' re a coward or not.
If you are, you can run.
Go ahead, run.
You will shoot me with my own gun?
I threw them away.
Then someone else is here with you.
No.
You' re alone.
Why not?
This is what you wanted, right?
What you were going to San Francisco for?
The chance to get me alone?
Yeah.
But what are you doing?
You want to fight me?
Man to man?
Woman, Mitch.
Yeah, that' s what I mean.
Man against woman.
You sure that' s fair?
Fair to whom?
I can' t do this.
- Can' t do what?
This.
It' s ridiculous.
You could hit me before, though, couldn' t you?
When I was defenseless.
That' s not going to --
As I was saying, that' s not going to do anything.
Then what will do it?
Are you such a coward that you can only hit me when I' m not expecting it?
I don' t understand, Slim.
How does this work for you?
I mean, this is carefully thought out.
You beat me up or whatever.
You won' t murder me.
So all you' ve done is further piss me off.
Self- defense is not murder.
You don' t have the guts.
Come on.
It' s not self- defense when you break in here and attack me.
Attack you?
All I did was slap you around a little bit.
You really think you' re going to kill me and get away with it?
I told you.
Self- defense.
As arranged in our letters, I' m here to talk about Gracie.
There are no letters.
Sure there are.
In the drawer where your pistol was.
You just put your prints all over them.
You attacked me, I fought back.
If something should happen....
I don' t care how long it takes.
I only have to hit you once.
Just one good hit and it' s over.
He bleeds.
You can count on one thing, baby.
Even if I don' t kill you, you' il never see Gracie again.
You never will.
I' m confused, Mitch.
Aren' t you a man?
Can' t you hit me again, even once?
What do you think now?
All your training, all your practice....
It' s over, baby.
It' s over.
- I can' t do it, Gin.
What do you mean?
What happened?
I can' t do it.
He' il come after you and after Gracie.
I know all that, but I can' t do it.
I' m not a killer, Gin.
I' m not him.
I can' t do this.
Slim, are you there?
Should I call the cops?
Slim, answer mel Sliml
Hold on to my voice.
He thinks he' s won.
And as sure as he' s a coward, he will try to kick you.
Some woman called.
Ginny?
He' s still in there?
Armed?
Dangerous?
Looks like you' re one of the lucky ones.
Mommy!
My baby!
Where are we going now, Mommy?
Anywhere you want to go.
Emerald City.
I was thinking the same thing.
- I have something to show you, Mommy.
Show me.
Something for you.
Look at all this.
Where did you get all this stuff?
From Hawaii.
<i>Welcome to the new airport international of Tokyo</ i>

- Bob Harris?
You are awesome, man! - "Sunset Odds", loved it.
Man, that car chase...
I couldn' t believe it!
Four buses, he took that thing and everything exploded.
I heard he did his own driving.
Did you do your own driving?
So, what are you doing here?
Seeing friends.
- We' re here on business.
- Later.
See you Bob!
Are you awake?
John?
Go to sleep.
Yes, I' m coming down.
I gotta go to work.
- OK.
See you later.
OK, bye.
He wants to tell you... to look at the camera.
OK?
- Yes.
Turn toward the camera.
Does he want me to turn from the right, or turn from the left?
Right side... with intensity.
Is that everything?
It seemed like he said quite a bit more than that.
It is like an old friend and... into the camera.
Make it Suntori times.
Could you do it slower and more intensity.
Make it Suntori times.

Really great. </ i>
I went to visit this Shrine today.
And there were these monks chanting... and I didn' t feel anything.
I didn' t try the ikebana.
I don' t know any more to whom I’ m married.

- Nothing, it is not serious. </ i>
<i> - I recall you later.

Bye! </ i>
Bye.
Today, at the fitting they had all these rock and roll clothes, but the band wasn' t tough at all.
The boys of the stamp don' t stop to say "Lock more" Loll and,
But it would be better if they remained skinny and skinny as they began.
They make them wear these clothes to the Keith Richard, it is so ridiculous.
Yeah.
Yeah, that is exactly what I was saying.
But try you of...
I want to say... that is what I think.
Do you think that this is done?
I don' t know.
Would you please stop smoking!
I like to.
I don' t really smoke that much.
But it is so bad for your health.
I will stop later.

- Yes, Mr. Harris, welcome.

- Yes?

We just got a request from Taleban Morri.
He is the Johnny Carson of Japan.
It is a big honor to be invited to his shawn.
Can you stay here until Friday?
But I think I have to check with my agent.
- I believe I may have a previous commitment.
- OK, I understand.
- Yes.
<i> - I think that you should make it.

<i> - I must be on a plane Thursday night.

<i>Apparently, he' s a elite name. </ i>
The Johnny Carson of Japon, yeah.
<i>Bob, these people are paying you a lot. </ i> <i> - could you reconsider...

You know, I gotta get out of here, as soon as I can.
<i>Allright, schedule... but hold it for you Saturday, allright. </ i>
Hold on, you' re breaking up, Fred.
There is no reception in this studio.
Call me back.
Can your put your hand close your face?
Sorry.
Can take your own hand close your face.
I don' t get that close to the glass until I' m on the floor.
How' s this?
Yes.
You want a whisky?
This is not whisky, this is ice tea.
If you gave me real whisky...
I need a mysterious face.
Tension is mysterious.
I think I know what you want.
It is this, right?
I need more mysterious and...
More mysterious...
I' il just try to think... where the hell is the whisky.
Are you a movie star?
Yes, I should be doing movies, but...
And the "Lat Pack."
Do you know "Lat Pack?"
- "Rat Pack?"
- Yes, please.
More?
You are quiet a gentleman, yes.
Sinatra, you know Sinatra.
- "Ol 'blue eyes."
It is good.
Yeah.
That, it is Dean Martin.
Joey Bishop, would you like?
Yes, just change film.
Are you drunken?
No?

Close your hand, please.

Yes, close your face.

The car is outside.
Shall we go?

- Yes.
John?
What are you doing here?
I am just here to photograph a group.
I' m here promoting that action movie i did, you know...
I' m doing 20 millions interviews per day, it is crazy!
So good to see you.
How long are you here for?
Well, we' re here for one week, I' m gonna shoot in Fuka Waka.
- Oh, it is amazing!
- Yes.
- This is my wife, Charlotte.
Really nice to meet you.
Your wife?
You are my favorite photographer.
No you are, I only want you.
It is true!
I' m sweating a lot, sorry.
Listen, let' s all go out for a drink sometime.
Yes!
- Call me, okay?
You ask for Evelyn Waugh.
Good, arigato.
- Evelyn Waugh?
Evelyn Waugh was a man.
Come on, she is nice.
Not everybody went to Yale.
It is just a pseudo, for Christs sakes.
Why do you defend her?
Why do you have to plan how stupid everybody is all the time?
I thought that it was funny for her...
Hello, John, we gotta go.
Bye..
<i>Did you ever wonder what your pupose in life was? </ i>

I really believe in reincarnation.
That is part of Jumi too, and of "Mignight Velocity" because although Keanu dies he eventually gets reincarnated.
So, there is hope in reincarnation, I think.
What was it like working with Keanu Reeves?
He was always giving me ideas really helpful.
He made me feel really comfortable.
We both have two dogs, and we both live in Los Angeles.
So we have all these things in common.
And we both really like Mexican food, and Yoga, and Karate.
He got married a couple of times.
To some nice women.
And beautiful women too.
You and I would be crazy for these woman, but... there were always rumors.
I never liked this actress, so I never gave a damn whether he was straight or not.
Hey!
Thank you.
What can I get you?
I' m not sure.
For relaxing times...
Make it Suntori times.
I' il have a vodka tonic.
So what, are you doing here?
A couple of things.
Taking a break from my wife, forgetting my son' s birthday.
And getting paid two million dollars to endorse a whisky, when I could be doing a play somewhere.
But the good news is: the whisky works.
What do you do?
My husband is a photographer, so he is here working.
I wasn' t doing anything, so I came here.
And to be with some friends who live here.
How long have you been married?
Two years.
25 years for me.
Your probably just having a mid- life.
Did you buy a Porsche yet?
I was thinking about it.
25 years, it' s... impressive.
Well you figure, you sleep one third of our life.
That knocks of 8 years of marriage, right there.
So you' re down to 16 years in change.
You are just only a teenager at marriage: you know how to drive, but there is still the ocassional accident.
What do you do?
I am not sure yet.
I just graduated last spring.
What did you study?
Philosophy.
There is a good buck, in that record.
So far, its proven Ok.
I am sure that you will figure out the angles.
I hope your Porsche works out.
Cheers to that.
Wish I could sleep.
Me too.
How was that?
It was good, I am tired.
I gotta go downstairs to meet Kelly, for drinks to talk about some photo thing.
Maybe I' il go downstairs with you.
You want to come?
Yes.
OK.
Everybody always telling me
"Kelly, you are an anorexic."
I eat so much junkfood, you would not believe me.
I have a very good metabolism.
It is strange, because I thought that you were anorexic.
Because you seem if... you know.
Thank you, I know.
I eat whatever, I have a good metabolism.
My dad was an anorexic.
Really?
Yes, he fought on the American side of "The Bay of the Pigs."
And the whole time that he was there, they tortured him about food.
Every day, they told him that they had put poison in his food.
So they would always make themselves throw- up after every meal.
That' s horrible.
Crazy shit.
Do you know a little the Station wagon- Beatific?
I' ve been like taking it to next level shit
like I' il take that and put a delay on it.
So its like evolving the beat, so it sound hell large on the track.
You know what I' m saying?
No.
You don' t listen to a Hip Hop?
Oh my God, listen to me!
I tried this power cleanse.
It so amazing.
Promise me than you will try this power cleanse?
I did it last week.
It is amazing.
It is so good to get the toxins out of your body.
Hello!
You ever switch seats?
If I fall, someone will notice me.
You having a nice time?
Can you keep the secret?
I' m trying to organize a prison break.
I' m looking for like, an accomplice.
We would have to first get out of this bar, then this hotel, the the city, and the country.
Are you in or out?
I am in.
See you.
I hope your better at drinking, it is going to take courage.
The label got me these.
I love it, wanna have some?
I must go.
You know, you don' t have to stay here.
You don' t have to go, do you?
You are going to be working the whole time.
I' il will have a much better time here.
Call Traleen and Sands.
I will be back Sunday.
And I love you.
See you, okay?
- Bye.
- I love you.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- How go you?
- Well, and you?
Yes, it is nice.
Did you sleep?
Not yet.
And you?
No, not yet.
How long are you staying for?
I will be at the bar for the rest of the week.
That is good.
I am going to see some friends later, if you want to come?
Sure.
See you later.
See ya.
I like the Burgundy one, but whatever you like.
Which, Burgundy, is it?
Hold on.
Hold on!
You really are having a mid- life crisis, hey?
I was afraid of that.
I just wanted to be ready, in case we go to war tonight.
My bathroom is more messy that yours.
And it' s not like they are not trying.
Can you take that out for me?
You are too tall!
Anyone ever tell you that you may be too small?
Whose is this?
Finding your true crawling. "
I don' t know.
I have that.
Did it works out for you then?
Obviously.
Okay.
Where are your shoes?
Where are your keys?
In my bag.
Just here.
- Go there.
The elevator is there.
I must go there.
Bob, this is Charlie Brown.
I am very happy.
How are you?
- Why do they call you Charlie Brown?
Charlie Brown of Snoopy.
I' il be right back.
I' il present you to mine friends.
Very beautiful friends.
See Mayumi.
Delighted Mayumi, I am Bob.
Do you like the United States, no?
He is surfing teacher.
He' s your surfing teacher?
Do you surf?
The emperor' s House?
Do you have anything...
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you doing?
We started speaking English.
Get out!
Come on!
Hey, guys, come over here!
Hurry up!
My God, this is gorgeous.
Hello, I am Hanks.
Nice to meet you.
Charlotte, nice to meet you.
Last week, I went surfing.
This is the grass that we made.
What kind of weed is it?
<i>Give it to me</ i>
<i>Mesdames and gentlemen, Mr. Bob Harris. </ i>
<i>Merci, it is not easy. </ i>
Hello.
< Bob i>Bonjour.
You know, the carpet samples, were you right about the Burgundy, it is my favorite.
<i>I' m happy that you like it. </ i>
I saw a great house tonight, that you would have loved.
And that Burgundy would have been good in this house, really.
The guy designed his own house and built it.
<i>I wish I' d seen that. < / i></ i>
It was a fashion guy ", with people a lot of fashion people."
And the guy was playing really good music.
I should have found out what that was and bring some back.
I will try to find out.
<i>You must be patient one instant? </ i>
<i>You must eat something for the breakfast. </ i>
Tell to him that she must eat something.
<i>Just trying to get her to eat something. </ i>
Tell her that I said that she has to eat something.
<i>Your dad said that it is necessary that you eat something! </ i>
Tell her I said so.
<i>She will not eat anything, forget it. </ ii></ i>
<i>Look I' m glad you' re having fun</ i>
It is not that I' m having fun.
It is that it is very different.
<i>I have to get the kids ready for school. </ i> <i>so can I call you in a while? </ i>
I might not be up.
It' s like 4.
<i>you better get some sleep, you have work in the morning. </ i>
No actually, they gave me tomorrow off.
<i>That must be nice. </ i>
<i>Allright thanks for checking in, </ i>
<i>I must go. </ i>
Allright, have a great night, I guess have a great morning.
<i>Good night, Bob. </ i>
Good night.
That was a stupid idea.
Just feeling tight, shoulders and neck.
So I called down, and had a a Shiatsu massage.
That' s nice.
The tightness has completely disappeared, and replaced by... unbelievable pain.
Stagering, unbearable pain.
That' s too bad.
I got my foot banged up.
Want to see it?
How do you say no?
Oh, my God!
When did you do this?
The other day.
It hurts, you know.
Didn' t you feel any pain?
Yeah, it really hurted.
That toe is almost dead.
I think I have to take you to the doctor, you cannot put that back into the shoe.
No, you don' t think so.
Well, you either go to a doctor, or leave your foot here.
He' s smiling.
You like that idea?
They love black toe in this country.
Do you have a sharp knife?
In this country, someone has to prefer black toe.
Black toe!
We should probably hang around until someone orders it?
What' s with the straight face?
Hospital regulations - get in there.
No, don' t.
Use the horn!
Let' s try "Mixed intestines".
- Switched the beer, hey?
Someone switched the sake.
Hello.
We need a doctor or emergency room.
It is not an emergency, it is just my foot.
We go over there... which number?
We' re not going to another hospital, so whatever you say is okay.
Could you put that back in the garage for us?
Is it for me?
Yeah it can be for you.
<i>Hey Bob, it is Charlotte, </ i>
<i>I am going to meet Charlie in this club called, "The orange". < / i></ i>
<i>I' il fax you the plan, so you can get there.
<i>Bye. </ i>
How long have yo been here?
I could' nt say.
Where are Charlie and those guys?
They are taking a dance class.
- Can I get you a drink?
- Let' s go.
He avoids the defense... he has room to run... and he comes back!
He dances!
But where he goes?
There you are!
Say hello.
Are you ready?
Come!
Thank you Tokyo!
The first time that I saw you, you were in your tuxedo in the bar.
You were very dashing.
I like the "Mad Squirrel".
The first time that I saw you, was in the elevator.
Don' t you remember?
I guess you do kind of blend in.
Did I pull you the language?
No, you smiled.
- Yes.
It was only an accidental smile, I haven' t see it since.
Just that one time.
Like that, but bigger.
Bigger.
Not that big.
<i>My Goodness! < / i></ i>
Why did they switcht the "R' s and the" L' s here?
To laugh, to mix it up.
They have to amuse themselves.
Because we are not making them laugh.
Let' s never come here again because it would never be as much fun.
Whatever you say, you are the boss!
I am stuck.
Does it get easier?
Yes.
It gets easier.
Oh yeah, look at you!
Thank you.
The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less things upset you.
I just don' t know what I am supposed to be.
I tried beeing a writer but I hate what I write.
but I am mediocre.
Every girl goes through a photography phase.
You know like horses... to take some stupid photos of your feet.
You will figure that out, I am not worried for you.
Continue to write.
But I am so mean.
It is what it is necessary.
And your marriage?
Has it improved?
It is hard.
One had fun well, before.
Lydia came with me on the filmings and one laughed of all that.
she takes care a lot of the children, but she doesn' t have need... that I am... present.
I miss to the children, but they are well.
All complicates itself, with children.
It is frightening.
The day of the birth of the first is the most terrifying of your life.
No one tells you those things.
Life that you lived until there is finished.
And comes back never.
But they learn to walk, and they learn to speak, and you want to be by them.
And you discover that these are the most marvelous people of your life.
It is cute.
Where did you grow?
I grew to New York.
Then I moved to Los Angeles with John, once gotten married, but it is so over there different.
I know.
John finds that I am snob.
Your case is not desperate.
Hello?
<i>J' ai a fax for you. </ i>
You can slip it to me under the door, please?
< does i>Vous want I send it to you?
Slip merely him under the door, please.
Thank you.
- Well.
Goodbye. </ i>
Mr. Kawasaki?
It is Bob Harris.
I would love to do this talk- show.
I would.
I would love to change my plans, and stay.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Mr. Bob Harris!
He wants to show you his dance.
A Japanese dance.
Does he want that I dance with him?
He wishes you the welcome.
Hello?
How does that go?
< does i>Je fall badly?
No, it is always the good moment. <i>ils doesn' t have a carpet anymore of this off the shelf color. </ i>
<i>Ça will take twelve weeks. </ i> < does i>you want another color?
What you will want, I am lost.
< just i> It' s a carpet.
It is not of that that I speak.
<i>What do you speak? </ i>
I want to be in good health, to take care of me.
I want to eat healthily, I don' t want any doughs anymore.
I would like to eat of the Japanese food.
You will be able to eat some every day. </ i>
How are the children?
<i>Good, they miss their father, but they begin to get used. </ i>
<i>Want me to worry for you, Bob? </ i>
Only if have you desire.
<i>Bob, I have some things to make, I must go there. </ i>
Okay.
<i>On sees itself... one speaks itself later. </ i>
- OK, hello. </ i>
Hello.
<i>Merci many.
One takes a small pause, to immediately. </ i>
Hello, Champagne, thank you.
Hello!
I go there.
Do last overnight?
I go to the sushi- bar in Nakayama, do you want to come?
I see that you are occupied.
Hello?
<i>Allo, Bob, it is I</ i>
<i> - Hello?
- It is Lydia, your wife. </ i>
I hear you badly.
< does i>you want to speak to Zoé?
Yes.
<i>Zoé, come to say hello to your father. </ i>
<i>She is busy. </ i>
Not serious.
<i>Remember that her ballet is on Sunday, don' t forget. </ i>
I won' t forget.
<i>Pleasant travels, see you later. </ i>
<i>Man! </ i>
<i> - OK.
- Okay, hello. </ i>
Hello.
she is more close to your age.
You can speak of that that you have joint, as to grow in the years 50.
Maybe she has beloved the movies that you made in the years 70, when did you make more movies?
Who tells to you that she showed me the attention?
I am going to have a beer instead.
I don' t see the difference.
One wants two like that, okay?
<i>... toward the exit the more proche, </ i> <i>i will direct you toward the first floor. </ i>
<i>Follow the orders of the persons responsible. </ i>
Then, this horrible to eat lunch?
Atrocious.
Obligated to cook oneself and do they call that a restaurant?
Do you leave when?
Tomorrow.
I will miss you.
I don' t want to leave.
Then, remain here with me.
Let' s make a jazz band.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Hello Mr. Harris, good journey.
- Thank you.
Goodbye.
I need one minute.
I am in the lobby, I will leave now.
I called to know if you always had my jacket, and if you could take down it, but you are not there.
And... therefore... goodbye, and benefit of the jacket that you stole from me.
Hello, how did it go?
It went very well.
It was a pleasure.
Excuse me, are you Bob Harris?
I am one of your big fans.
Very happy to meet you.
What do you make to Japan?
I must go there, now.
- Hello.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
I missed you.
Do you go there now?
Yes, my bodyguards are there.
You don' t wish me good luck?
OK, goodbye.
Do I can you to take in photo?
Of course.
Wait for me there.
Hey, you!
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
No talking in the ranks, Karlberg!
Let' s maintain proper behaviour in the ranks, boys.
– You' re not allowed here. – But I want to see you.
– Can I ask you something? – Yes. – Will you come and watch tomorrow? – Do you want me to?
– Will you win? – lf you come I' il win.
Do you have the guts?
The winner of the 200 metre freestyle is Erik Ponti from class 3: 5.
So now there' s only the 300 metre freestyle left.
It' s between you and Lewenheusen.
What are you doing to do? – What do you mean? – Are you going for it?
Should I let Lewenheusen win?
More sportsmanlike not to enter the race!
This is not about being sportsmanlike.
Haven' t you understood that? – This is Stjärnsberg. – Hey, boys!
Just thought I' d check that no one falls before the last hurdle.
We' ve got them!
Be careful not to get disqualified at the start. – Everything has already been decided. – For that very reason.
Show them! – What' il happen if I win? – You' il be untouchable.
I promise.
It' s a matter of honour for me.
Go.
The over– all champion and holder of three new school records, Erik Ponti!
Hello there... – l' m decorating the tree. – l can see that.
I can see that you' re decorating the tree.
Erik...
My darling, welcome home.
I' ve missed you so much!
How is my little boy?
You look so grown up. – Doesn' t he?
But what the hell is he wearing?
You look like a tram driver.
You look lovely, really lovely.
Look. – But what happened to you there? – Nothing.
It' s wonderful.
We' il keep it here.
Are you hungry?
We' il be eating in a minute.
Venison.
This is very good.
How many straight A' s have you got?
But what the hell is all this?
C for Behaviour?
How does our "Stjärnsbergian" explain that?
Has it got something to do with all the weekend detentions?
Just think, you won the school championships in swimming.
But my dear, that' s not what we' re bloody talking about, is it?
Do you have an explanation?
What did you want to be then? – Left in peace. – What?
Left in peace.
ln peace...
So you thought your mother should sell off her heirlooms – – so you could be left in peace. – ls that it? – No.
That' s not what you meant.
What then?
How many do you want, Erik?
Thank you.
Look how wonderful it looks.
Pommes duchesse, marvellous.
Erik, you know whenever there' s something I don' t understand – – we have to have a talk after dinner.
That' s what we' il do.
But... have some, darling, start.
Haricots verts... how delicious!
There we are...
– We' re friends again. – Friends again...
Marja!
Marja!
– Hello, Pierre. – Thanks for the record.
Sounds good! – What' s this? – Open.
lf you' re going to be a lawyer you' il need one of these.
Not that it applies in this school, but nonetheless.
School rules shouldn' t be above the law of the land, should they?!
No, thanks.
What? – l haven' t done anything. – Don' t give me any lip.
I haven' t done anything. – Come to the council at 19. 00.
Understood?
How did it go?
What did they say? – Three weekend detentions. – Why?
I gave them lip, refused the pepperpot.
The next time: the ring!
"No fun thumping a coward and an intellectual."
Room search!
Stand up straight, Tanguy! – What the hell are you doing? – Stand up straight, Tanguy!
Stand up straight, Tanguy!
Good.
It looks like we have a bed– wetter here.
Be ready in an hour, Tanguy!
They' re trying to get at you.
They' ve just changed their tactics.
Good day, sir!
– Good day, sir! – Erik!
– l' ve got an idea about the training. – l' m not going to swim any more. – What?
You can' t do that. – Yes I can.
But... you' re the best swimmer we' ve ever had.
You said I' d be untouchable.
That it was a matter of honour for you.
You know that.
There are many different ways of making life hell for people.
Wait.
I' m sorry, Erik.
It' s not possible.
Rat!
Come up for an inspection.
Rat! ln here.
Good that you could come, Rat.
We need an independent witness.
Fatty here is just about to admit he' s been smoking on the sly. – No! lf you hit him, you' il be expelled. – That' s quite right.
Paragraph 7.
Who' s going to prove that?
A rat and a pig?
Shit, Dahlén, it' s like a bloody zoo in here!
Now about that confession.
It' s about time you stubbed out your cigarette for good.
Stub it out, you coward!
What?
With any bloody permission you like.
You haven' t got the guts, have you?
Get dressed, Tanguy!
Present yourself in the ring tomorrow at 19. 00.
You know...
None of this really needs to happen.
That' s what rules are for.
Why should your friend have to suffer – – just because you think you are above everyone else.
You should give some thought to that.
Come on.
He' s an evil human being.
But why?
Was he born like that or has he been here too long, maybe beaten as well...
That' s how the system works, isn' t it?
Revenge later on...
That' s why it just continues.
Does it hurt?
I just know that people like Silverhielm have to be fought.
Not now or ever.
That' s it!
– Have you seen Pierre? – No. – Have you seen Pierre? – No. – Have you seen Pierre?! – Not since the maths class.
ls it true he' s been called to the ring tonight?
I' ve already decided.
– l' m going to do it. – Why?
Otherwise it' il just carry on. lf I do it now, maybe they' il leave me alone.
"Might as well get it out of the way."
But you' re not like me, Pierre.
Not a bit, more than you can imagine!
I' ve been fighting my whole life, and once you' ve done that it never ends.
But help me then.
It' s not about that.
Something in your head.
You don' t seem to understand.
How do you know I will?
Get beaten up...
You' re not the only one who can fight.
What?
Do you think you' re better than me?
You like putting yourself above the rest of us.
Because you keep quiet when they burn you with a cigarette.
It doesn' t matter what you say.
FlGHT, FlGHT, FlGHT!
Pierre Tanguy, come and get your punishment!
Come on, Tanguy!
Come on, little Piggy!
TANGUY, TANGUY, TANGUY!
Will you do as you' re told from now on, or carry on being cheeky?
– Do you promise to do as you' re told? – No, you coward, you bloody swine! – What did you call me? – A swine!
One more time?
On your knees!
Get down on your knees!
Never!
– What' s the time? – Almost 9. – Have you had any sleep? – Yes, a bit.
You got in a good punch there.
Have you been practising on the quiet?
No.
I' il have a word with Silverhielm.
This is going to stop.
I have to go to my house arrest now.
See you tonight.
Will you be okay?
Erik...
Yes, see you later.
One of the boys in 2: 5 is sick, so you must do his punishment duties. – But I have to go up to house arrest. – Don' t give me lip!
Here...
These have to be put into the ground in a 2x2 metre square.
Firm as a rock! – Then you can go to your arrest. – Yes.
Get to work!
You can go and have some food now.
Let me go!
Let me go!
I hope you put the stakes in properly.
We' il take your dick last of all.
Are you scared?
I' m never going to be scared of you, "Shittyhielm."
Start with the warm water.
Pour it on!
LE' TS BOlL RAT!
– Pour it on!
Pour it! – l don' t want to!
Looks like you need cooling down, Rat! – Cold water!
He' il freeze to death.
– Are you cold? – Yes, a little.
Dear Erik, by the time you read this letter, I' il have left Stjärnsberg.
Don' t think I' m a coward.
I tried to hold out for as long as I could.
There is so much I want to say, but the taxi is coming in a minute.
Anyway, I want you to know that you' re the best friend I' ve ever had.
lf you like you can write to me at my mother' s address in Stockholm.
Your affectionate friend, Pierre.
I didn' t have space for my works of Strindberg and the gramophone.
Please make full use of them.
Come in!
– Hello, Erik. – Hello.
– Am I disturbing? – No.
No.
The rumours are flying.
Nothing.
Very sad about Pierre.
It really is.
What kind of freaks are you?
Don' t you understand what you' ve done?
Pierre was one of the most gifted students we' ve ever had here.
You and he were close friends, Erik.
Couldn' t you have defended him?
Why didn' t you defend him?
Why didn' t you defend him?
Are you as cowardly as the others?
You get expelled if you fight with a council member.
The thing that separates humans from animals – – is not only intelligence, it' s also morality.
The ability to know the difference between good and evil.
You have all behaved like animals.
Like vultures.
It' s undignified!
Do you hear me?
Undignified!
This has to stop.
I don' t think sir understands exactly what' s happened here.
Thank you.
The ring in one hour.
Bring von Schenken with you.
After much deliberation, Rat has decided to accept the challenge.
Teach him a lesson in the true spirit of Stjärnsberg.
You may start.
I' ve got a question.
Do I have to hit both or is it enough if one crawls out?
Just one more question.
Can I hit them as much as I like? – Fight! – l was thinking about you, Dahlén.
I thought I might break your nose. – And you!
I' il break your left arm at the elbow.
Don' t talk so bloody much, Rat!
We said the nose, didn' t we?
Crawl!
You too.
Crawl!
I' d like to talk to Marja.
Can you ask her to come out?
– Marja doesn' t work here any more. – What?
She got fired.
Three days ago.
For what?
This gives us "hidden wedding" or "hidden fertilization".
Erik... – Erik! – Yes? – Are you alright? – l' m fine.
Von Leiven.
Vinberg.
Ponti.
Ponti has a letter from Finland.
Room search!
I found it!
This is even better than I thought.
"Don' t worry about me getting with child with you."
That prostitute can' t even put it in proper Swedish! "With child with you!"
"I had my diaphragm on." The stopper on her head, not in her cunt?!
Eh?
"But I suppose it' s both of our fault."
"Maybe it' s true I love you, but not that I think we' il meet again."
I don' t think so either!
You' ve fucked the kitchen whore!
When the headmaster sees this you' il be expelled straight away!
Stretch your legs a bit!
And now sit down, gentlemen. – Not you, Ponti!
Go to the headmaster straight away!
Take your things!
Gentlemen!
It' s November, the 6th of November to be precise, 1632, Lützen.
Dense fog before us.
Come in.
lf I understand things right, you' ve been having long– term problems...... finding your feet at Stjärnsberg.
ls that right?
Well, the school rules are very clear on these matters.
I have no alternative but to expel you without matriculating from your year.
I would prefer to have you off school premises – – shall we say by 1 5. 00 tomorrow.
It' s my duty to inform your parents – – but I assume you' d prefer to have a word with them first.
The letter, may I have it back?
– What are you going to do with it? – Her address.
I' d like to write to her.
The best thing you can do know is to forget about that girl.
When you read this I have left...
One thing I want you to know...
Maybe it' s true I love you, but not that I think we' il meet again.
Stop!
Only members of this school are allowed to eat here.
Hello?
Who is it?
Erik, hello?
Erik, is it you?
It' s just the two of us now, Silverhielm.
It' s 2 kilometres to the stable and even further to the school.
You could make a run for it.
You' re fairly quick.
lf you go now, it' il take me 100 metres to catch up with you. – What the hell are you talking about? – Down on your knees! – You' re bloody mad. – l said, down on your knees!
Money?
I' il give you 10 000.
My word! – 1 0 000?! ls that all you' re worth? – l' il give it to you tomorrow. – l swear on my honour as a nobleman. – Your honour as a nobleman?
You did everything to provoke me.
It' s the sort of thing they use to identify a rotten old corpse.
And the teeth, of course.
You won' t enjoy having all your teeth out, but you won' t feel a thing...
Are you mad?
They' il give you a life sentence in prison.
No proof once I' ve burnt your clothes!
I won' t tell anyone else.
Did you really think I was going to kill you?
I' m not like you, Silverhielm.
I' m not like you.
Three cheers...
Dear colleagues...
I' m extremely moved by all this kindness.
And I' d very much like to say on behalf of my wife and myself...
I think we have a visitor.
Still here?
I thought we had concluded any remaining business. – lt was the thing about the letter. – Maybe I didn' t make myself clear.
What are you trying to say?
Leave the school premises immediately! – Do you hear? – Excuse me if I' m interrupting things. – Who are you? – This is my lawyer.
The name is Ekengren.
Good day to you, gentlemen.
Well, this is a rather sorry tale for everyone involved, you might say.
Who happens to work for this newspaper.
He was very interested to hear about Erik' s story.
ln fact he' d like to come and write a reportage on this school.
And perhaps flesh out Erik' s story a bit more.
However, you may not feel this sort of publicity will be of benefit...
Perhaps we could...
The legal implications are already clearly set out here.
I don' t know what you think, Erik?
Could we possibly avoid making this a police matter? – Maybe. – Excuse me, what is all this about?
lf all the information has not been squarely placed in front of me, then...
Surely Headmaster has access to all the information?
As I say, if there are certain circumstances – – to which I have not been alerted – – then naturally I would like to be told of them.
lf you' il all excuse me.
Have some cake in the meantime! – Alma...
May I have it back?
Thanks.
Behave for the rest of the term and get in touch when you come back.
It' s not my hope but rather my conviction – – that you' il go into life bearing something – – that we proudly call the Stjärnsberg spirit.
Now it all begins.
Good luck!
Erik, if you see Pierre give him my regards.
Erik, take care of yourself.
With these reports you' il get into any Sixth Form college you like.
But a D in General Behaviour!
ls that heading in the right direction?
I mean, before you had a C.
And now you have a D.
What' s your explanation?
She was a waitress, just like you.
We' il talk this over after dinner.
What' s the matter with you?
What are you staring at?
What the hell are you staring at?
What are you staring at?
You' re coming with me!
Erik!
I' m sorry.
You' re getting out of here.
ln half an hour you' re going to be in hospital.
You won' t see, your nose will be snapped, your arms will be broken.
You won' t dare tell anyone.
You' il say that you fell down the stairs.
lf you get the police involved, they' il find out what you' ve been doing to us.
This is going to hurt a hell of a lot.
You' il be screaming until you pass out.
I swear I' m really going to do it.
People like you have to be destroyed.
This is the last time, then never again.
I thought you' d be in Savolaks by now. – Where are you going? – To Geneva.
Business. – l thought you wanted to write. – Many things one wants to do!
You?
I' ve got a job in a legal firm over the summer.
We' re friends. – lt makes no difference to me. – Because you' re rich.
– l' il be seeing you, Erik. – l' il be seeing you, Pierre.
We are going down.
Repeat, engines two and...
Mayday!
Andrew, this is your father.
Hello?
Look, you don' t call me back, so I don' t know how to do this.
If you' re not gonna return my calls... then there' s no way for us to communicate...
Look, I don' t know how to do this... but you' re gonna need to come home now.
Last night...
Your mother died last night, Andrew.
She drowned.
Last night, she drowned in the bath.
Ten résumés just today.
They come in every day from Idaho or Milwaukee or Florida.
And you know what they want even more than a guest spot on Everybody Loves Raymond?
This cannot happen again.
This will never happen again.
And if I ever say this again, your job will go to...
Sparkling or flat?
Waiter 10, do you have your earpiece in?
You forget the order 41 for Table 101.
What, are you on break?
Nah, I’ m just messin 'with you.
Uh, we' il have four Ketel Red Bulls and...
And I' il have a Ketel cosmo with a Red Bull and some bread ASAP.
What do you mean?
How can you not have bread?
Uh, we' re a Vietnamese restaurant.
We just don' t have bread.
But you' re not Vietnamese.
No, I' m not.
Can I have something to chew on?
Bamboo, whatever.
I' il see what I can find.
Flight Number 121 with non stop service... to Newark International will be departing from Gate 32.
Shit, yo.
Holy shit.
What' s up, man?
Largeman, what are you doing here?
Uh, that' s my mom.
- Fuck.
- Oh, fuck.
Yeah.
So, welcome back home.
Thanks.
So what have you been doing?
You still, uh, acting and shit, right?
- Yeah.
- That' s cool.
I hear that place is, like, fucking crazy.
My cousin' s a writer out there.
Says that place is mad crazy.
He' s, like, writing a movie about snowboarders or some shit.
I don' t know.
Um, but I should introduce you to him, Largeman.
Maybe you two could do something together.
Yeah, definitely.
What are you doing tonight, man?
No real plans.
I' m just in town for a couple days, so...
You should come out with us.
We' re gonna go over the Gleasons' house.
They' re having some... fucking huge party or something.
- Supposedly.
Supposedly.
- Really?
- He lives up on the hill.
We' il probably go over there after we bury your mom.
- Same.
What?
I' m sorry.
Since I met her, she never showed an interest in anything.
All of a sudden, a month ago, she wakes up... she wants to redecorate a bathroom.
I helped her.
- Oh, must have been fun.
- Well, I sew.
It' s a shirt.
Thank you.
Will you try it on now?
Now?
In case I have to fix it before you leave again... and we don' t see you for another nine years.
I wanna make sure it fits.
You' re gonna love the material.
I used the leftovers from your mother' s design.
Gorgeous.
Hi.
- How you doing?
"Well, besides that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the show?"
You know, I' m not really sure what to say here, Dad, so I' m sorry.
How are you?
I' m okay.
I' ve been getting these really bad headaches though.
Um, they' re really quick.
It' s like a... just a little lightning storm in my head.
Just for a second, and then it' s gone.
I just thought maybe you could help me get that checked out while I' m home.
Go see Dr. Cohen first thing in the morning.
He' s a neurologist in my building.
I' il call him.
He' il fit you in.
I' m sure it' s nothing to worry about.
Oh, that' s nice.
Yeah, we' ve been doing a lot of work on it.
Really?
Actually, no.
I don' t know why I just said that.
Someone redid the, uh, hallway bathroom.
I saw that.
That' s new.
I' m glad you' re here.
Saying good- bye is important.
I' m glad you could fit it in.
- Put your hands on your head, please.
- What?
Please.
Eighty- two in a 25.
What are you gonna tell me, you' re late or just tired?
- I was...
- Shut the fuck up!
- Largeman.
- Kenny?
Oh, man.
How you doing?
I' m great.
- Your mom just died!
- I know.
Yup.
You' re a cop, Kenny?
I know.
I don' t know.
Couldn' t think of anything better to do.
No, but it' s really cool though, man.
People really listen to you.
I mean... they have to!
- Yo, and check this shit out.
That' s the safety.
- Oh, cool.
And plus, the benefits, man.
If I get shot, I' m like... rich!
But, Kenny, the last time I saw you, you were doing coke lines off a urinal.
It' s time to grow up.
Plus, I wasn' t making shit in that fish market.
No one knew who I was, couldn' t get laid.
It' s a much better situation for me, man.
Speaking of which, um, how' d I do?
I don' t know.
You know, just the whole...
You mean, like, as a cop?
The whole, "Shut the fuck up!"
Well, I thought you were a dick, so I guess that' s good.
So, what the fuck, man?
You' re this huge movie star now?
I heard you did some... you played a big football player or something.
- I didn' t see it.
- It was just this thing...
- Fucking De Niro and shit.
- What?
- He' s awesome.
- Yeah.
- Deer Hunter?
- Yeah.
Man, we should sit down and we should talk... because I' ve got some really good ideas for movies.
You could play me and shit.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, definitely.
That sounds good.
- Holy shit!
- What' s up?
- How you doing, man?
- How you doing, man?
Good to see you.
Get this guy a beer.
This guy does not wait for a beer.
He' s a moviestar.
Like, uh, Jersey' s De Niro and shit.
- Largeman, man, what are you doing home?
Press junket.
That' s phat, yo.
Fuck, yeah!
Serpico and shit.
"Attica!"
Shut the fuck up, man.
You like that?
Like, uh, "press junket"?
That' s improv, bitch.
You can use it.
Right?
Let me show you something.
Oh, whoa!
What' s going on, man?
Hey!
How are you, brother?
- How' s it going, man?
I haven' t seen you in so long.
I heard you' re kicking ass.
Oh, um, basically the man bought my silent Velcro patent.
- I developed this little item.
It' s just like Velcro, but it doesn' t make that... the Velcro noise.
- A lot, man.
Wow.
So wh- what are you doing with yourself?
Nothing.
Yeah.
First month I went out.
I bought a whole bunch of shit.
But, y...
Nothing.
Someone got a joint for me?
Oh.
No, thanks, man.
Really?
I thought you were a big movie star and shit.
- Nah.
- Well, then here.
Eat this.
Welcome home.
- I guess I' il see you guys later.
Should we play a game?
Let' s play "spin the bottle."
I' m not playing "spin the bottle."
How old are we?
- Or more importantly, how old are they?
- Oh, they' re all legal.
I think.
Well, we just ate all this fucking "X," so what the hell else are we supposed to do?
Girl has a point.
- Fucking right.
- I' m in!
- Largeman, this is Dana.
- Hi.
Hi.
- This is gonna be a good night.
It' s good, isn' t it?
I always try to save a couple of the marshmallows till the very end... but I never make it.
I always end up with... a bunch of flake things and pink milk.
My mind wanders.
How long have you been working at Medieval Times?
B- But I' ve only been a knight for two.
You have to pay your dues.
I worked in the stables and helped in the kitchen.
When I started, he was making the coleslaw.
It hasn' t been the same since you got knighted.
But I really just stirred it.
Don' t be modest.
Mr. Modesty won the joust last night.
- Congratulations.
- It' s not that big a deal.
What was it that happened to you in highschool?
You had a thing.
I forgot what it was.
- No, he didn' t.
How do you know?
He got the shit kicked out of him by Tyrell Freedmen.
- I fucked him up too.
- He knocked your teeth out.
He only chipped one tooth.
So, uh, w- what are you up to now, Mark?
You' re digging graves?
Mark' s getting into real estate.
- What?
- No, I can' t.
- Yes, you can.
- What the fuck is Klingon?
- Like the Star Trek guys?
- Yeah, he can speak their language.
- No, she' s kidding.
No, I' m not.
Why are you being shy?
- It' s just..
It' s made- up.
I don' t...
- Don' t be shy.
Tell them what you said to me last night.
Say what you said to her last night.
You gotta be kidding me.
It means, "I like to mate after battle."
- Yeah.
No.
No.
That wasn' t the one I said.
This one means, "Kill Kirk"... and also "Hallelujah," depending on the context.
- Honey, that is good.
- You know what that means, Tim?
Well, I do.
It means, "Get the fuck out of my house... before I chop your fucking head off."
Mark, he' s a knight.
He' s just a fast- food knight.
I should get going.
Thanks, uh, for the cereal.
I had a lovely evening.
By the way, it says "balls" on your face.
- Asshole.
- My mom did it.
In the spring... the hungry gator must find new and clever ways to find food.
Did you tell Large about... the tapes?
No, Mom.
I' m not doing those stupid tapes.
- What are the tapes?
- Real estate tapes.
You can make up to $100, 000 your first year.
You should have seen the boat this Oriental guy had.
He even had his own game show in China, he had so much money.
I think Mark would be perfect at it.
Ma, shut up about those fuckin 'tapes.
It' s a scam.
Well, I' m doing it.
I' m saving up for those tapes.
Because I know what you could be if you just apply yourself.
I do apply myself every day, Mom.
Okay?
I' m not in any rush.
What' s your rush for?
Just let me be.
I don' t rush you.
Then I' il do 'em myself.
Do 'em.
Okay, then I won' t let you on my yacht.
Except Large.
Large, you can come anytime you want.
Just don' t bring your friend here.
Shit!
I got to go to my meeting.
Okay.
I love you.
- I love you too.
- I love you.
- Large, it was nice to see you.
- Nice to see you too.
Oh, you guys, don' t stay in here all day...
'cause I took the batteries out of the carbon monoxide detector.
It was beeping all night.
She drives me crazy!
She gets all baked out and makes me feel like I have to impress her.
And you know what?
I' m okay with being unimpressive.
I sleep better.
- Hey, what time is it?
- No idea.
I gotta go.
Hi, I' m Andrew Largeman.
- I' m really late for my appointment.
- Andrew.
Okay, Andrew.
I' m gonna need you to fill out this paperwork for me.
Thank you.
I' m sorry.
Have a seat.
- Hello, Miss Lubin.
- Oh, hello there.
Just have a seat.
We' il be with you soon, okay?
- Thank you.
- You' re welcome.
How' s it going?
Get off.
- Heel.
Oh, what?
- You got any suggestions?
- Yeah, kick his balls.
Kick his balls.
Yeah, but I don' t wanna destroy future generations of charitable dogs.
Don' t worry about it.
I got three Dobermans.
If I didn' t kick them in the balls regularly, I' d never get anything done.
But he' s gotta be close to finishing by now.
Not yet.
Here comes the lipstick.
Mrs. Lubin?
We' re ready for you now.
- Okay.
Come on, Arthur.
- I feel so used.
- I recognize you.
- Oh, did you go to Columbia High?
No, not from high school.
- Didn' t you play the retarded quarterback?
- Yeah.
Are you really retarded?
No, I' m not.
Cool.
Great job, man.
I mean, I thought you were really retarded.
You' re just as good as that Corky kid, and he' s actually retarded.
If there was some sort of retarded Oscar... you would win like hands down, kick his ass.
Well, thank you.
Thanks, I appreciate it.
I have to fill out this form though, so...
- Right on.
- Thanks.
My cousin' s an actor.
Jake Ryan Winters.
Doubt you' ve ever heard of him.
He was, like, on Xena once as a gnome or something.
Thanks.
Oh, my God.
That last scene... where you give the speech to the whole stadium... and your dad... oh, your dad gives you the thumbs up.
Aw.
That was emotional.
No.
You know, I' m auditioning...
I can' t believe you' re not really retarded.
I mean, Jake' s not a very good actor.
You can' t really tell on Xena 'cause he' s in the hairy gnome suit... but when we were little, he used to put on these really, really low- budge... renditions of Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals in our attic.
Like, so bad.
It sucks, though, because there' s not that much work for little people, you know?
- Anyway, I' m talking too much.
I' il just...
You got to fill out your forms.
What are you listening to?
The Shins.
- You know them?
- No.
You gotta hear this one song.
I swear.
You have to...
You gotta fill out your forms.
Think you could, uh...
- maybe listen while you fill out your forms?
- I think I can handle it.
Yeah?
It' s good.
I like it.
- So, what are you here for?
- What are you here for?
You?
I, uh...
Oh, fuck, that was nosy.
I am so nosy.
I didn' t mean to be.
I' m sorry.
I get these headaches.
I just want to have it checked out.
Cool.
- Yes.
- We' re ready for you now.
- Oh, okay.
Nice meeting you.
- You didn' t.
I' m Sam.
Nice to meet you.
Good luck with your head.
Thanks.
Don' t worry, Sam.
We' il be with you next.
- Mr. Andrew Largeman?
- Yes, hi.
- There' s absolutely nothing wrong with you.
- What?
Just kidding.
I' m Dr. Cohen.
What can we do for you today, Andrew.
Um, I' ve been getting these really intense headaches.
Um, they last for like a split second.
It' s like lightning, like a surge of electricity, and then it' s gone.
Lithium?
How long have you been on the lithium?
Um, I' ve been on some form of it since I was 10 or so.
And the Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa...
Depakote... did they, uh, help you at all?
I mean, I don' t know.
Uh...
It' s recently occurred to me I might not even have a problem.
Only, I' d never know it because as far back as I can remember, I' ve been medicated.
I left them in L. A. Though.
This is, uh, the first time I haven' t had medicine in my body for... along time.
You know that stuff will leave your body pretty fast.
- I can write you a prescription.
- Actually, I was thinking about taking a little vacation.
Have you discussed this with your psychiatrist?
Uh, well, my psychiatrist is my dad.
So I think he' d prefer me to stay on it.
He... likes to think it makes me happy.
You know, our bodies are capable of doing some very funny things... when they' re consumed with stress and anxiety.
I found my ex- best friend' s cufflinks in my wife' s purse.
I couldn' t get an erection for a year and a half... for example.
I don' t really feel like stressed or anxious at all.
It' s amazing you can even hear me now.
I think you do need to find a psychiatrist that isn' t your father.
That' s something that should have been remedied years ago.
He knows better.
And secondly, uh, I' m in no position to comment on... whether you should stay on the meds or not because I don' t know your story.
But my opinion, since you' re paying for it... is that, yeah, those drugs may help you as means to an end... but sooner or later, if you' re not in some sort of therapy... whatever' s going on in your mind will find a way to peek its little head out of the water.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
You' re alive.
Come on.
I' il take a look at you.
Come.
I' il need you to take your shoes off.
I have to scratch your feet.
So why were you really there?
I' m a robot.
- Do you lie a lot?
- What do you consider a lot?
Enough for people to call you a liar.
- People call me lots of things.
- Is one of them "liar"?
I could say no, but how would you know I' m not lyin '?
I guess I could choose to trust you.
- You can do that?
- I can try.
Whose bike is that?
It was my grandfather' s.
It was the only thing he left to anyone in my family, and he left it to me.
And I like it.
So this is the point in the conversation where you ask me if I’ d like a ride home.
- It is?
- Yep.
Would you like a ride home?
But I' m not getting in that sidecar.
- Why not?
- Sidecars are for bitches.
Anyone who rides in that is automatically your bitch.
Thus, I will ride on the back.
- Whoa.
- Hold on tight.
Holdin '.
My hair is blowin 'in the wind.
What, are you like a hang glider?
My boyfriend was gonna pick me up so I brought it.
- But then he couldn' t.
No.
He drives a Ninja.
Goes way faster than this guy.
- But what kind of helmet is that?
- You can wear it on a bike.
- Anyway, how' s your head?
- I should live through the day.
Make a right here.
Are you doing anything right now?
- Can you elaborate on "doing anything"?
- I know this guy, Jesse.
He bought this mansion that' s right up here... and he wants me to come visit him.
I could just say I have to take you home when I' m ready to go.
That' s pretty damn random of you, Andrew.
- "Nice to meet you.
- No.
- It' s the Hollywood in you, I guess.
Come on.
I' il tell you what, we can have like...
like a signal.
Like, when you pull on your ear, that' s the code.
And then I' il be like, "Oh, I got to take her home." And then we' il go.
Can we have code names too?
If you want.
'cause my step- uncle' s a bounty hunter and he could have you tracked and killed.
You' re such a liar.
You ready?
I' il be fine.
Am I the first boy you' ve ever brought home?
I lied to you before when I told you my boyfriend drives a Ninja.
- He doesn' t drive a bike?
- No, I don' t have a boyfriend.
- Wow.
We' re off to a great start.
Okay.
So sometimes I lie.
I mean, I' m weird, man.
About random stuff too.
I don' t even know why I do it.
It' s like a tic.
"Wow, that wasn' t even remotely true."
So how do people know what' s real?
Well, I always feel bad afterwards and admit them when they' re lies.
Can you trust that?
Open the door.
Kevin, down.
Mom!
Kick him in the balls.
Kick him in the balls.
Mom!
Everybody down!
Who wants to eat?
Do you want to eat?
Then get the fuck off him.
Kevin!
I' m so sorry.
We just don' t have the time to train them.
Who' s got the time to train them?
- Mom, this is Andrew.
Welcome.
I' m sorry the place is a wreck.
Honey, I asked you to get the metal wheel out of the hamstercage.
- I forgot.
- Well, you forgot and now Jelly' s dead.
Luckily, I got Peanut Butter out in time.
We have to get the only hamsters on planet Earth... who can' t figure out a stupid hamsterwheel.
There' s a tin box on the kitchen counter.
You can do the honors.
I have to get to work.
- It' s nice to meet you.
- Yes.
Andrew.
Very nice to meet you.
Samantha, put the clothes in the dryer and bury Jelly.
So this is it.
- It' s nice.
- No, it' s not.
Don' t say that just 'cause you can' t think of anything else.
I' m not.
It' s very cozy.
You guys are a little early on the tree though.
When it got to be fall again... we figured, "Just leave it up."
You' re totally freaked out.
You' re totally freaked out right now.
- You, like, can' t wait to leave.
- I' m not.
I like it.
- It' s very nice.
Sure.
- Hey.
Titembay, this is my friend Andrew.
Andrew, this is my brother, Titembay.
It' s very nice to meet you.
- Oh, it' s nice to meet you.
- I' m sorry about Jelly.
- Oh, that' s okay.
It' s in the fridge.
Thank you.
Anyway, I' m late for class.
It' s nice meeting you.
- Very nice to meet you.
- See you later.
So here we are.
It' s nothing fancy, but you know...
What?
Titembay, right?
Yeah, it' s weird, huh?
You' re, like, so freaked out right now.
It' s okay.
You can go.
Don' t feel bad.
It' s really...
- Stop doing that.
- What?
The whole thing you just did.
If I didn' t, I wouldn' t be.
Okay?
Okay.
So, Titembay.
- Yeah, he' s my brother.
Kind of.
My mom adopted him from Sally Struthers like years ago.
One of those "For the cost of a cup of coffee a day" sort of things.
Where she' s like, "How can you just sit there and not help the children?"
We just couldn' t sit there and not help the children.
So we start sending him like pictures and letters and stuff for years... but then I got really into ice- skating, so we sort of forgot about him.
Then one day we get this phone call and it' s Titembay.
And he' s at the dry cleaners around the corner.
And he' s like, "I' m at Rutgers.
I live in the dorms... but I' m used to living with my tribe so I' d rather live with a family. "
And he' s been living with us ever since.
Wow.
Yeah.
I know.
You gotta hear his stories.
He struggled through so much because he wanted to learn.
You know?
He' s studying criminal justice at Rutgers, and when he was a baby... he was one of those kids with, like, the flies all over his face.
Wow.
I mean, I- It' s a crazy story.
Yeah, I know.
I mean, that' s a true story.
I am not that good.
This is Tickle.
- What is Tickle?
- Tickle' s my favorite thing in the whole world.
It' s all that' s left of Nanny, my blanket.
- Mm- hmm.
- Was there like a hurricane or something?
- Shut up.
No, I mean, I' ve had this since I was a baby.
It' s what they brought me home in from the hospital.
- It' s like the Wailing Wall.
- What?
Uh, the Wailing Wall is like this, uh...
It' s like the most holy place for Jews to go and pray in Israel.
It' s all that' s left of this enormous temple that was destroyed by the Romans.
So you' re like really Jewish.
- You are.
- No, I' m not.
I’ m Jewish, but I' m not really Jewish.
I don' t do anything Jewish.
But I don' t know any Jews that go to temple.
The Jews I know, they go on one day.
- It' s Yom Kippur, the Day of Repentance.
Did you know that most temples are built with moveable walls... so that on the one day of the year when everyone comes to repent... they can actually make the room big enough to hold everyone?
I don' t really believe in God.
- Just Tickle.
- Oh, I believe in Tickle.
- What?
I' m sorry.
I just totally ruined that moment, didn' t I?
- It' s just that we' re not gonna make out, okay?
- Oh, no, I hadn' t planned on trying...
I am so lame.
That was like really...
I' m sorry.
I am...
And...
- You know what I do when I feel completely unoriginal?
- What?
And then I can feel unique again even if it' s only for like a second.
So, no one' s ever done that?
No, not in this spot.
You just witnessed a completely original moment in history.
You should try it.
Thanks.
- No, come on.
- I think that was good enough for both of us.
Come on.
What are you, shy?
This is your one opportunity to do something... that no one has done before and that no one will copy again throughout human existence.
This one thing.
How was that?
Oh, I' ve done that one before.
I gotta go bury this hamster before the dogs eat him.
Hmm?
- Wow.
- Yeah.
- I mean, this is, uh...
- I know.
It' s not that we' re bad pet owners or anything.
It' s just, you know, we' ve had so many of them over the years.
Besides, a lot of these are fish.
After you.
All right.
Sit down.
What are you thinking about?
- Now?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Right now, I was thinking I' ve been going to a lot of these things lately.
- What, dates?
- Not dates.
Is this a date?
This isn' t a date.
Funerals.
Why?
Who else died?
That' s why I' m home actually.
Um...
My mom just died.
God, that' s weird to say that out loud, but, uh...
Yeah, that' s why I' m home.
I' m so sorry.
God, I' m so sorry.
And here I am, like, putting you through another one of these.
Not that Jelly' s like anywhere near your mom' s.
I mean, we loved Jelly but...
No, it' s okay.
It' s all right.
I' m all right with it.
Anyway, I think it' s what she wanted, so...
How' d she die?
She drowned actually.
My mother was a paraplegic.
She was in a wheelchair so she, uh...
I guess she was taking a bath... and she must have slipped or something.
That' s what they say.
I don' t...
But... needless to say, she drowned and... that' s how she... sh- she died.
When?
Sunday.
Oh, my God.
Why are you crying?
I don' t know.
I' m sorry.
I' m not usually like this.
It' s just like...
It' s just so sad.
You know, it' s like...
It' s so tragic, isn' t it?
It' s like real life tragedy or something.
Anyway, let' s change the subject, okay?
Let' s really bring the focus back to Jelly...
'cause what could be ruder than talking about someone else who died... when you' re in the act of burying a close friend?
- I don' t know.
I' ve only been to one of these things.
You appear to be the expert.
Well, we usually say something.
Um...
Didn' t really know you, Jelly.
From what I hear, you were a good pet.
- Little trouble with the wheel but...
- That' s not funny.
Jelly, you were a great pet.
I' m sorry I forgot to take the wheel out of your cage.
I' m so, so sorry about that.
Good- bye.
I hope that you liked me.
You scared the shit out of me.
- Why are you always doing that?
I know.
I' ve been catching up with people around here.
Dr. Cohen called.
There' s nothing wrong with you.
Yeah, I think I' m starting to figure that out myself.
- When are you thinking of leaving?
- Uh, probably tomorrow.
Um, you know, I got a lot of stuff I got to take care of in L. A.
- Probably have to find a new job, so...
- We need to talk.
Yeah, uh, how?
I mean, when?
What are you doing... now?
I told my friend Mark I was gonna meet up with him.
But how about, uh, like later tonight?
Then we' il talk.
- Yeah.
We owe that to each other.
Yeah.
We owe it to her.
Yeah.
Good.
Sorry I scared you.
How could you leave all that lithium?
I was totally going to hit you up for some, man.
This fucking guy.
I' m glad you' re back, man.
This town is so messed up.
Everyone' s got their drug of choice.
It' s like in Brave New World.
You ever read that book?
Who wrote that?
Um, Aldous...
Aldous something.
Aldous, uh...
Anyway... there' s like Alphas and Betas and Epsilons and all sorts of people.
Huxtable.
Aldous Huxtable.
That' s it, bro.
Andrew, would you like to see Sam' s ice- skating tape?
- Mom, no.
- Absolutely.
She was so ahead of her time.
She could have gone to the Olympics.
I couldn' t have.
Yes, you could have.
Don' t blame it on the epilepsy.
- You had a gift.
Let me see it.
Let' s just show him the "Florida Stars of the Ice" opening.
The gator costume.
- Mom, I' m asking you, seriously.
Don' t be shy.
Let me see it!
Oh, she wants you to see it.
How could you not want him to see how talented you are?
- Were.
- Come on.
- Ohh!
- Honey, what are you doing?
- I' m dusting for prints.
Well, could we move the crime scene into the kitchen?
I want to show Andrew Sam' s skating.
But someone' s been pissing on my GameCube, and I' m about to close the case.
It wasn' t me, Your Honor.
Hmm.
Sit down here on the couch.
I can' t believe you' re actually showing him this.
Look, there she is.
- You' re the alligator?
- You can tell by the hands.
- Here comes the double axel.
- Land!
Oh, I mean, come on.
Is she good?
- Wow, she' s great.
- All right.
- Wow.
- Shut up.
- No, I mean, your mom was right.
You' re really good.
- This is awesome, but we gotta go.
- Just wanted to show how talented you are.
My baby!
All right, go on!
Go on.
Get away.
Wait a minute.
Gimme a hug.
I love you so much.
I' m so proud of you.
- I love you too.
- Have a good night.
- Come on!
You' re giving me a hug too.
Come on.
- I' il take a hug.
- Good night.
See you later, Tim.
- Bye, Tim.
- Peace out, player.
It was the only thing I ever liked doing.
Pretending to be someone else.
I' ve been so out of it lately, the only parts I get offered are playing handicapped people.
- That is not funny.
You gotta see that' s a joke.
If you can' t laugh at yourself, life' s gonna seem a whole lot longer than you' d like.
All right, so what are we laughing at you about?
I lied again.
- I have epilepsy.
I, um...
I had a seizure at the law office where I work.
And they told me their insurance wouldn' t cover me unless I wore preventative covering.
- What' s preventative covering?
- The helmet I was wearing.
Oh, come on!
That' s funny.
That' s really funny.
I mean, I' m the only person who wears a helmet to work... who isn' t, like, putting out fires, or, like, racing for NASCAR.
I mean, I can' t quit.
Their insurance is amazing.
What do you do?
You laugh, you know?
I' m not saying I don' t cry.
But in- between, I laugh.
And I realize how silly it is to take anything too seriously.
Plus, I look forward to a good cry.
Feels pretty good.
I haven' t cried since I was a little kid.
I didn' t cry at my mother' s funeral.
I tried, you know?
Like, things in movies, this...
I just focused in on it, you know?
But nothing came.
That actually made me sadder than anything... the fact that I just felt so numb.
- What do you mean?
- Just that...
Hey, Vagina!
Hey, what' s up, guys?
- Hey.
- What' s up?
Hey, nice to meet you.
I' m sorry I said "vagina" just now.
- I didn' t know you were here.
- Nice.
Let' s get fucked up.
Whoo!
- What are you doing?
- Largeman, get the fuck in the pool!
- It' s so warm!
Can' t you swim?
Of course I can swim.
Dude, maybe you should stay on the steps.
I don' t know C. P. R.
- You look like a wet beaver.
There' s handful of normal kid things I kind of missed.
There' s a handful of normal kid things I kind of wish I' d missed.
You know that point in your life when you realize the house you grew up in... isn' t really your home anymore.
All of a sudden, even though you have some place where you put your shit... that idea of home is gone.
I still feel at home in my house.
You' il see one day when you move out.
Just sorta happens one day, and it' s gone.
You feel like you can never get it back.
It' s like you feel homesick for a place that doesn' t even exist.
Maybe it' s like this rite of passage, you know?
You know, for...
For the family you start.
It' s like a cycle or something.
But I miss the idea of it, you know?
A group of people that miss the same imaginary place.
Maybe.
How about some fuckin 'furniture, dude?
I bought a chair, but I didn' t like it.
- Where is it?
- It' s keeping us warm.
- Silent Velcro.
- You lucky motherfucker.
I feel like if I had showed up at school and presented the idea of silent Velcro... they would have sent me away a whole lot sooner.
- Oh.
Listen to this girl.
- They didn' t "send me away."
- You just said they sent you away.
They sent me to boarding school.
"Sent me away" sounds like I went to some asylum or something.
- There were no straps involved.
- Why did they send you to boarding school?
They sent me to boarding school because... they thought I might be dangerous.
"Oh, are you freaked out?
- You can go.
Don' t feel bad. "
- It' s really funny.
Why would they think you' d be dangerous?
You' re like a little detective.
- Want to know?
- Yeah.
- You' re gay.
Drum roll.
I was the reason she was in a wheelchair.
I pushed her.
So there that is.
- Shut up!
- Fuck off.
That' s the truth.
- Why?
It was just a complete freak accident, you know?
It' s one of those things you replay a million times in your head... and you see how clearly it was just a complete freak thing.
My- My whole life, she was depressed for no reason.
I was a little kid.
I was nine years old... and I just hated her for that.
And it was innocent.
- 'Cause...
Fuck, yeah!
And any other time, you know... any other day, she would have just yelled at me and sent me to my room.
But this day... on this particular day... the door of the dishwasher... had fallen open... the latch on it was broken.
And it would just randomly fall open.
That fuckin 'latch, you know.
It' s really amazing how much of my life has been determined by a quarter- inch piece of plastic.
So, anyway, she, uh... she fell back over the door... and, uh, hit her neck on the kitchen counter, paralyzing her from the waist down.
- Wow.
- Still want to compare fucked- up families?
But your mom was in the wheelchair long before you left.
Yeah.
Well, I was nine.
So they sent me to therapy and put me on these drugs... that were supposed to "curb my anger," and I' ve been on some form of them ever since.
And when I was 16, my psychiatrist dad came around to the conclusion that... it probably wasn' t the best environment for me to be growing up in, so... he sent me to boarding school.
- Until now.
- For her funeral.
- Till now for her funeral.
- Jesse?
Where' s the sauna?
- I' il show her.
- No, I- I got it.
- No, you get her a towel.
Want a ride, sweetheart?
You' re in it right now, aren' t you?
- What do you mean?
- My mom always says that when she can see...
I' m, like, working something out in my head, she' s like, "You' re in it right now."
And I' m lookin 'at you, and you' re... telling me that story, and... you' re definitely in it right now.
I think you' re right.
I am in it.
All right.
Can we just change the subject, okay?
- Good stuff?
- Yeah, like "glass half- full" shit.
- What do you got?
Got that.
- What you got?
- I got a little buzz goin '.
And I like you.
So there' s that.
I guess I have that.
You want to see me tap- dance?
I would love to see you tap- dance.
- What are you doing?
- You collect Desert Storm trading cards?
Fuck yeah.
Those things are collector' s items, man.
You have any idea how much those things are gonna be worth one day?
- Hell, yeah.
That' s just like an investment.
I have lots of little investments all over the place.
One day I' m gonna sell all of 'em just fuckin' live off of it.
So, like how much is this one worth?
- Which?
- "Night Vision Goggles."
I don' t know.
Mint?
Uh, two, maybe three.
- Dollars?
- Yeah.
You don' t sell 'em yet.
Don' t you know anything about investing?
I' m gonna live off that shit.
If you have a complete set, it' s worth, like, thousands.
- So do you have the complete set?
- Almost.
The corners are bent on my "Friendly Fire," and someone stole my "Wolf Blitzer."
Whaddya got to do today?
I got you a little going- away present... but, uh, I gotta kind of track it down first.
- So can you give me a ride?
- Uh, yeah.
I just, uh...
- What?
I just, uh...
Say it.
Speak.
- So, uh...
- She can come.
I don' t care.
I really don' t want to be in Handi- World.
We' re getting money for your present.
- How do I look guilty?
- Andrew Largeman?
Benson.
- Oh, no.
- Who is that?
- Just don' t give him your number.
What' s up?
- How' s it goin '?
- Yeah.
- I thought you killed yourself.
- What?
I thought you killed yourself.
- That wasn' t you?
That wasn' t me.
- Who killed themselves?
- Oh.
- Oh, and Tina.
- Tina who?
- You remember Tina.
- She was anorexic, did gymnastics...
- Oh, gymnastics Tina?
- I don' t know.
She wasn' t Jewish.
I didn' t bury her.
I think it was sleeping pills.
Or that car in the garage thing.
I forgot.
- Uh, sorry, this is Sam, Karl.
Karl, Sam?
- Uh, you two stay here.
I' il be right back.
- Is it heavy, or...
Okay.
- Hey, weren' t you on a TV show or something?
- Yeah, it was just this show.
So, uh, you' re like workin 'here.
That' s cool.
Only for a little while.
I' m opening my own business.
Actually, I should talk to you about it.
I' m lookin 'for smart people like you, Large.
- I should get your number.
- Yeah, definitely.
That' d be cool.
I' d like to talk to you... both... about a good opportunity for you and your loved ones.
We all have dreams.
I know I do!
I' d like to talk to you about an exciting opportunity that people are talking about.
- We gotta get goin '.
- Oh, okay.
It was good to see you, Karl.
- Hey, I should get your number.
- Yeah, definitely.
Well, I' il call you because I think he has it in his book.
Nice to meet you.
Why is it always the losers that get caught up in the pyramid schemes?
Why can' t it be some charming, hot girl nagging you incessantly to buy some shit?
- Is that what he' s doin '?
It' s detergent or some shit.
I don' t need knives.
- I' d like to return these.
- You got a receipt?
- Actually, no.
They' re a gift.
- Why are you returning these?
- They' re not sharp enough.
No.
Not for what we need them for.
- They couldn' t cut cans.
- You bought them to cut cans?
No, but in the commercial, it said if I wanted to cut cans, I could.
- With these knives, I can' t.
- It comes with a sharpener.
- Did you try it?
- Yeah.
They' re just...
- I don' t want them.
They' re not sharp enough.
- Okay.
A major loophole in the Handi- World return policy is that they permit returns... without receipts on items below $40.
So, how often do you go?
I hit every employee once, and then I wait until they hire new ones.
- Except for Karl Benson.
- You know, Mark, it' s my last day in town.
- If you need money, I could loan you some.
- I' m making my own right now.
- Fuck, take Jesse' s.
The guy' s a millionaire.
Okay, Andrew?
I make my own.
Favors are bad news.
Let' s go.
I gotta see a guy about a nitrous tank.
- What is this place?
I think you can see into the hotelrooms.
Oh, yeah!
I' m gonna fuckin 'cum!
That shit was hot.
I gotta go drop some knowledge on that ho right there.
How do you know she' s a hooker?
Of course she' s a fuckin 'hooker.
Girls who look like her do not fuck guys that look like him... unless it' s for coke, money or fame.
Well, Julia Roberts married Lyle Lovett.
- Who the fuck are you?
This is Large.
But why are you bringing these fuckin 'people here?
Wait.
Okay?
- Could you just tell us where to go now?
- That thing come with balloons?
What am I, a fuckin 'birthday clown?
Suck it off the tap.
And I need it back when you' re done...
- because that guy' s holdin 'my 39 bucks.
Hold up!
Who here just saw some titties?
Raise you hand if you just saw some titties.
Thank you!
So everybody just calm the fuck down!
You know where Kiernan' s Quarry is?
- Down in Newark, right?
- Yeah.
It 'sat the bottom of Hillside and Rivington.
You can' t really see it from the street, but it' s there.
Park your car at the gate and hop the fence.
Albert.
All right?
I' il call him right now and tell him to expect you.
Okay, stop.
What the fuck are we doin '?
- Just be patient, man.
- We' ve been patient all day... but it' s my last day and you haven' t told us what we' re doin '.
If you told me we were going on a six- hour hunt for blow, I would' ve passed.
If I was gonna get you coke, we would' ve gone to the fuckin 'high school football practice.
We would have been rolling five hours ago.
I think we corrupted this innocent girl enough.
- Yes, you are!
All right?
That' s what I like about you.
I don' t want this guy taking you to, like, some sketchy quarry... in the middle of nowhere to find, like, crackwhores huffing turpentine... or pit bulls raping each other or whatever it is you have us doing!
Wow.
That' s like the most worked- up I' ve ever seen you.
- He was protecting me.
- So?
- He likes me.
- Don' t be cute.
He' s my knight in shining armor.
Don' t talk about knights in front of Mark.
It' s a sore subject.
- I' m gonna kill that motherfucker.
- Pun intended?
- Oh, you' re fuckin '...
- Oh, my God.
- Wow!
I never even knew this was here.
They were supposed to build a mall here, I think.
Yeah.
I remember reading about that in the paper, that they were... digging or something, and they break into this natural phenomenon.
It' s like an underground Grand Canyon or something.
Now they' re in some huge legal battle over whether they can build here or not.
- on some, like, geological phenomenon?
They love their malls here, man.
Let' s find this guy and get out of here.
- You' re not gonna tell us what we' re getting?
- It' s a surprise.
You' il see.
So this is it.
Knock and barter for Desert Storm trading cards.
Don' t tease me about my hobbies.
I don' t tease you about being an asshole.
Okay!
- Mark?
- Yeah.
Albert?
Come on in.
You guys must be freezing.
Make yourselves warm by the fire.
I' m just gonna go put her down.
Okay?
Ah, I must say, I' m continually impressed with how each place you bring us...
- continues to be weirder and weirder.
- What do you mean?
This is nice.
Oh, nothing.
Just hangin 'out on an old boat at the bottom of a quarry in Newark.
It' s hardly the bottom, dude.
Did you check out that cliff down there?
This is my wife, Faye.
Hi!
Welcome.
Have a seat.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Man, it' s really comin 'down out there.
- It just started pouring all of a sudden.
- Well... in a bad storm, I like to pretend that this old boat' s my own private ark.
- I' m not quite sure it still floats.
- Listen, would anybody like some tea?
- I' d love some.
Thank you.
- Do you want some?
I' il be right back.
What is this place?
What is it that you do down here?
It' s, uh...
No one really knows what it is because we haven' t been able to explore it.
- to make sure no one comes inside.
But what they don' t know is that at night I climb down.
So, how deep does it go?
Thank you.
You know...
No one really knows.
But I like to pretend it' s infinite.
- Guardian of an infinite abyss.
Yeah, I guess it is.
But we also trade and deal in antique jewelry.
I suppose it is odd that we live down here like this.
- No.
- Not at all. - Never crossed my mind.
Well, we think it' s important.
What is it that you think you' re gonna find?
Of doing something that' s completely unique... that' s never been done before.
- "Albert' s Abyss."
- Well, maybe.
Who knows?
But, you know what?
That' s all ego.
None of that really matters.
If I get to be with this person right here... and our beautiful baby... that' s all I need.
Well, I suppose you want what you came all the way down here for.
Oh, yeah.
That' d be great.
It took me a while to track this piece down... but I owed Diego huge.
That' s it.
Thank you so much.
- Yeah.
- Really.
Good luck in the rain.
Um, do you guys want some garbage bags or something?
- Yeah.
That' d be great.
Good- bye!
- Hey, Albert!
- Yeah?
Good luck exploring the infinite abyss.
Thank you.
Hey!
You too.
So, uh, I don' t know if I' m gonna see you, man.
Don' t you want to know what' s in the bag?
To be honest, I don' t even care anymore.
What is it?
It' s my mom' s favorite necklace.
I' d be lying to you if I told you it was my plan all along.
I got it back to you, right?
That' s gotta be worth something.
This whole day was about this?
You didn' t want it down there with her.
It' s better it' s with you.
Okay.
If you ever need a Kato, you know where to find me.
This, uh...
This necklace reminds me of this really random memory of my mother.
And, uh...
She was just like, you know, cradling me and rocking me back and forth.
And, uh...
And there was just, like, snot dripping down my nose, right?
She gave me her sleeve... and she told me to blow my nose into it.
And I remember thinking, even as a little kid, like...
"Wow!
This is love. "
"This is love."
- Shut up.
- Yeah, I do.
Wait, wait.
We should save it or something.
Okay.
We could put it in my scrapbook, if I had a scrapbook.
- I think so.
I don' t really feel any more coming.
Well, if you do, just let me know.
I' il get the cup, okay?
This was such a good idea.
- Who are you?
- I' m your new friend Sam.
- Tissue?
Come here.
Fuck, this hurts so much.
Yeah, I know.
But that is life.
If nothing else, that' s life, you know.
It' s real.
Sometimes it fuckin 'hurts.
To be honest, it' s sort of all we have.
How are you feelin '?
Safe.
When I' m with you, I feel so safe.
Like I' m home.
- Dad.
- I' m sorry I woke you up.
No, I was just reading.
Where have you been?
Everywhere.
Been on sort of a crazy journey these last couple days.
You' ve been avoiding me.
No, I haven' t been.
Okay, maybe I have been.
I' m sure you can find lots of things in your life... that you can be angry about.
But what I do not understand is why you' re so angry at me.
All I ever wanted was for everyone to be happy again.
- That' s all I ever wanted.
- When were we all ever happy, Dad?
You always say that, but when was that?
When was this time that we were all so happy?
'Cause I don' t have it in my memory.
Maybe if I did, I could help steer us back there.
You know, you and I need to work on being okay... if that' s not in the cards for us.
Well, we might have a shot at it... if you can forgive yourself for what you did.
What I did.
Okay, let' s- let' s do it.
Okay, we' re here, right?
I' m gonna forgive myself for what I did.
Are you ready?
That' s what I think.
That' s what I think about the whole thing, okay?
They left me completely fuckin 'numb.
I have felt so fucking numb to everything I have experienced in my life, okay?
For that, I' m here to forgive you.
You always said all you wanted was for us to have whatever it is we wanted.
Maybe what Mom wanted more than anything was for it to all be over.
Even if it' s pain.
That' s a pretty weighty experiment to take on, don' t you think?
This is my life, Dad.
I spent 26 years waiting for something else to start.
So, no, no, I don' t think it' s too much to take on... because it' s everything there is.
I see now it' s all there is.
You and I are going to be okay.
You know that, right?
We may not be as happy as you always dreamed we would be, but...
for the first time, let' s just allow ourselves to be whatever it is we are.
And that' il be better, okay?
I think that' il be better.
What are you thinking about?
- You' re not coming back, are you?
- Come on, Sam.
- Of course I am.
- No, you' re not.
You don' t realize this is good.
In your life, you know?
I mean, this...
We can work this stuff out.
I want to help you, you know?
We need each other.
I haven' t even lied in, like, two days.
Is that true?
- No.
This isn' t a conversation about this being over.
I' m not puttin 'a period at the end of this, you know?
I' m puttin ', like, an ellipsis on it.
Because I' m- I' m worried that if I don' t go figure myself out... if I don' t go, like, land on my own two feet... then I' m gonna fuck this whole thing up, and this is too important.
I...
I fired my psychiatrist.
I gotta go find a new one.
Look, I' m gonna call you when I get there.
I' m gonna call you.
Look at me.
Look at me.
You changed my life.
You changed my life, and I' ve known you four days.
This is the beginning of something really big.
But right now, I gotta go.
Come here.
Take your seats as quickly as possible.
- What are you doing?
- and then finding you once I figured stuff out?
- The ellipsis?
The ellipsis.
It' s dumb.
And I' m not gonna do it, okay?
'Cause like you said, this is it.
This is life... and I' m in love with you, Samantha.
I think that' s the only thing I' ve ever been really sure of in my entire life.
- Yeah.
- And I think I can do this!
I mean, I want to.
- Yeah!
- Right?
- Yes!
So what do we do?
What do we do?
Get down!
Hello.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Captain David Ward, British Army.
- What' s your name?
- Michael Lundberg.
- And where are you from?
- Denmark.
- What' s your rank?
- Major.
- I want to speak to my wife.
Yes, of course.
I' m alive.
- Yes, sir.
You were lucky.
Did you have any contact with the other captives?
- What do you mean?
- You must have seen them.
I' m sorry we have to do this but I have some photos of men missing in action -
These photo also contain non- British nationals.
We just need to know if you' ve seen any of these men.
No.
I' m sorry.
You' re certain you' ve never seen these faces?
No.
I' m sorry.
Well, thank you, sir.
Now get some rest.
- Thank you.
Jesus, it' s good to see you!
Likewise.
I want to talk to my wife.
Why can' t I talk to her?
Has something happened to her?
We thought you were all dead.
You' ve been declared dead.
Have l?
All we knew was that you crashed.
What does my epitaph say?
I hope Jannik didn' t write it.
- Up you go.
Are you drunk?
- No, you' re drunk!
How much did you drink?
Sarah speaking.
- I want it!
- Don' t do that.
- I want to throw it...
Go on!
- Natalia, what happened?
- What did you do to my sister?
You' re too easy!
What' s wrong?
Hi, dad.
- Don' t cry now.
- I' m not crying.
- Who will get there first?
You have to see the kitchen, dad.
Come on, quickly.
- Look what we made for you.
Who did this?
Jannik and the three little pigs.
- Did Jannik do this?
- Yes, and some carpenters.
- Are you hungry?
- No, thanks.
What are you doing?
What' s he doing?
What' s going on?
Can' t we just lie here on the bed for a while?
All of us.
Come on.
- How long do we have to lie here?
- Just a little while longer.
Can I go watch TV?
- Okay.
Is dad dead again already?
- He' s just sleeping.
- You can' t die more than once.
- Yes, you can.
- No, you bloody well can' t.
- Hi, Michael.
- Can I talk to you in private?
Of course.
We' il go down to the office.
- Are you managing alright?
- Sure.
I wasn' t alone at the camp.
I saw Niels Peter.
We were in the same camp.
I didn' t think you had any contact with others.
But it' s good you remembered it.
Yes.
He were in the same camp.
I...
- What?
- Sit down, Michael.
Michael, when we find out what took place, I' il pass on the information.
Give yourself some time...
Then your memory will come back to you.
I' m better than I thought.
I didn' t expect that.
- But of course.
- I mean it.
I' m proud of you.
Yes, of course.
It suddenly made sense, right?
I know it sounds far out.
I don' t mind if you have.
Did you sleep with her?
- What?
- With Sarah.
I can forgive you.
I just want to know.
- I mean, you thought I was dead.
- But... we didn' t.
What the...?
Of course we haven' t.
Michael...
- I can forgive you.
- We haven' t.
- What makes you think that?
- You look like teenagers in love.
You used to be pissed off because I couldn' t stand her.
Now that I' ve found out how nice and lovely she is, is that wrong, too?
- Then don' t say things like that.
She' s way too old for me anyway.
Shall we...?
Tobias is stupid, but Arnold is nice.
He never hits people.
- He never hits people?
Not girls.
He' s the best at maths, and he' s got a dog with big ears.
- I can' t remember its name.
- Elephant?
It' s not a dog, is it?
An elephant is not a dog.
- It was only a joke.
Is it?
Sitting there talking nonsense...!
Michael, relax.
It' s alright.
Don' t be afraid.
And don' t be sad.
The girls have taken a fancy to Jannik, haven' t they?
- He said he' s slept here.
- Yes, a few times.
- Did he sleep in here?
- Of course he didn' t.
You could have fallen for each other.
- You thought I was dead.
- No, we couldn' t have.
- You look so cute together.
- Stop it.
- Did you sleep with him?
- Michael, stop it.
- You slept with him.
- Michael, nothing happened.
We kissed.
We were just confused.
- What else?
- That' s it.
Let go.
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go...
What the hell is wrong with you?!
What the hell are you doing?!
You' re crazy!
All of you!
Crazy!
Don' t be afraid of me.
Your hair looks nice.
Did mum do this?
- Natalia did.
- Did you?
Yes.
Don' t be afraid of me.
Alright?
I' m sorry that I shouted and did all those silly things.
But I love you.
Very much.
Both of you.
Don' t be sad.
Don' t cry.
I want you to be happy.
I want us all to be happy.
Promise me that you' il both be happy.
What is white in the air and yellow on the ground?
An egg.
- Have I told you that one?
- A hundred times.
A hundred times?
- Shall I push you?
- Yes, please.
Michael...
We have to talk about this.
Can' t you tell me what happened?
- Nothing happened.
- Oh, come on.
Can' t you tell me just a little bit?
- Tell me just a little bit.
- There is nothing to tell.
I sat in a dark room, thinking.
I thought about you all -
- and the time we broke up.
I drove over to your flat to apologise -
- but you wouldn' t let me in.
Come in!
- Ditte.
- Michael.
I' m glad you people call all the time, even if there is no news.
As long as we don' t hear anything, there' s still hope.
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yes, please.
Thank you.
I saw Niels Peter down there.
He was down there.
- Did you see him?
- We were in the same camp.
Why didn' t he come home with you?
He was moved to another camp.
That means he' s still alive!
Yes...
When he...
He was moved to another camp, but he was fine when I saw him.
He' il make it.
Would you like some cake?
We were together for a long time and he told me about Gustav...... and about you, of course.
He told me all sorts of things.
- You' re taking your driving test.
No, he said you wouldn' t...
- He was very proud of Gustav.
- He really wanted a girl.
But when Gustav came along, he was so pleased.
I' m sorry.
- Hi.
This is Solvej.
Solvej, my brother' s wife Sarah.
Come on in.
- There you go.
- Do I look okay?
Come on in.
Hi.
This is Solvej and this is my dad and my mum.
- This is my brother, Michael.
- Natalia is watching TV.
- This is Camilla, the birthday girl.
- Thank you so much.
It happened so fast.
It' s very nice to meet you.
Great!
- Where' s the bathroom?
I' il show you.
Taking a piss again?
Why don' t you open it?
Where did you meet her?
At the Royal Library.
What do you think?
In a bar.
- She certainly looks...
- She seems quite nice.
Lovely, lovely.
It' s war.
Today people need therapy when they fall off their bikes.
- They' re soldiers and trained for it.
- Stop messing with that doll!
Maybe they' re not trained to see people get shot.
- What do you think they trained for?
- Yes, but...
- That doesn' t make it nice, does it?
- Now Solvej has a point here.
- Stop it, Natalia!
Stop it, Natalia!
Eat up.
You hardly touched it.
- I' m not hungry.
I want to watch TV.
- Eat your dinner.
Camilla ate her dinner.
I didn' t get my bag.
- You' il eat your dinner.
- You don' t decide shit around here!
- Couldn' t you just stay dead?
- Natalia!
Why are you taking it out on me?
You' re just pissed off because mum would rather shag Jannik.
- What are you saying?
- You and Jannik shag all the time.
- That' s enough!
- Disgusting!
She has no idea what she' s saying.
- Give me your plate.
- It' s not true.
This is insane.
She' s just upset.
How long were you in lndia, Solvej?
- Four months.
- Did you ride elephants?
- That is so far out.
- Were you up north?
It' s beautiful.
- No, we didn' t have time.
- Little bastard.
Who the hell do you think you are?
I forgot I have to meet some friends, so...
Sit down, all of you.
It' s Camilla' s birthday.
- Nobody is leaving.
- I don' t think we need that tone...
Oh, be quiet.
What does that matter?
It' s difficult for all of us.
The important thing here is Camilla' s birthday.
- Yes, that' s right!
- And we' re celebrating that.
Mum...!
- Mum!
Mum.
- Why aren' t you asleep?
- I can' t sleep.
That was the worst birthday in my entire life.
We' il have a new one.
I promise.
What are you playing at?
I' m sorry about what I said.
Why did you say it?
I don' t like dad.
I' d rather have Jannik around instead of dad.
Me too.
Dad will be himself again soon.
Michael.
Get out of my way!
- Mum!
- Go up to your room.
Now!
- Please stop.
Do you realise what I did to be with you?
You don' t understand anything!
I' m going to fucking kill you!
Should I kill you?!
I' m going to fucking kill you!
Jannik.
Michael' s gone berserk.
Hurry!
Come on down.
The police, please.
I' m going to kill you all!
Sorry...
Don' t cry.
I' m going to kill you!
Sarah.
Sarah...
- My little brother.
- Jannik.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let' s all sit down and talk about it.
- Sarah, go to the car.
- Go to your room!
- Stop it!
- Michael!
- Go upstairs again!
Take the car keys!
You call that a punch?
Michael, Michael...
Did you call the cops?!
- Did you call the cops?!
- Michael...
Did you call the cops?!
Of course I didn' t call the cops!
You idiot!
- Nothing happened.
- Stop there.
Stop right there.
Nothing happened.
- Fuck, man!
He took my gun.
- Drop the gun.
Drop it!
- Drop the gun, Michael.
- Then shoot me.
- Drop the gun!
- Come on!
- Shoot me, then.
Come on!
You' il get a promotion.
Michael, drop the gun.
- Drop the gun.
- Who the hell are you?
Who the hell are you?
- Michael, for my sake.
- Shoot me.
Come on!
Shoot me!
- Put the gun down.
- Drop it!
- On the ground, both of you.
- Get down!
- Michael, get down.
- Get down on your belly.
- Lie down on you belly, okay?
Michael...
Do it!
Arms stretched out!
Handcuff both of them.
Don' t move.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Fuck...
He' il get off lightly.
He' s never been in trouble before and has a bag full of medals.
This is incredible.
Oh, I should be careful not to drop ashes in here.
- Let' s clean this up.
- Yes.
I' il throw this out.
I will always love you.
That is the only truth that remains.
Life is neither right nor wrong, good or bad.
But I love you.
That' s all I know.
Michael Lundberg, visitor for you.
She' s waiting outside.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Visit number 00412.
- Do you want to walk or sit?
- Take a walk?
- Yes.
- Did you have your hair cut?
- No.
I' m wearing mascara.
That' s right.
- You look good.
- Thanks.
This is from the girls.
- How are they?
- They' re fine.
And mum and dad?
Michael...
- I want to know what happened.
- No, you don' t.
It doesn' t concern you or anyone else.
It' s my problem, alright?
If you don' t tell me, you' il never see me again.
Ever.
I can' t.
Yes, you can.
He had a little boy.
He had a little boy.
My dear, sweet, Daniel...
You never have to be afraid of those boys, ever again.
I' il find you another school.
Pappa would have supported me in this, if he had been alive.
Everything is for the best.
Just believe that, and all will be fine.
When I grow up I' m going to marry you, mommy.
Ever since I was a little boy I had a dream to create music -
- that would open people' s hearts.
That was my dream.
At 14, I was to compete at the Junior Soloist World Championships.
A day I will always remember.
One thing was new...
For the first time in my life my calendar was completely empty.
The doctor said it was a heart attack.
It wasn' t fatal, but he didn' t give me much hope.
"Your heart' s completely worn out."
Jump, Daniel!
Jump!
I don' t know why I returned to the village of my childhood.
Sometimes you do things without knowing why.
I reckoned that no one in the village would know that I' d once lived here.
My agent had given me a new name when I was 15.
"Remember to let the tap run before drinking."
"The water comes from our own well."
I heard... you' d bought the old school here.
I thought I' d drop by.
I' m Stig Berggren, the village Pastor.
I wanted to be the first to welcome you.
It' s my little custom to give each newcomer a Bible.
In the name of Jesus Christ.
Thank you.
I arrived 25 years ago and we ended up staying, my wife and I.
Just think, Daniel Daréus here in our old school.
But one can only wonder, what will you do here?
- I see...
My wife Inger and I wonder if you' d care to come to our home for dinner.
Thank you, but I prefer to be alone.
Perhaps he could hold a concert here in the village.
I' ve stopped performing!
Though the church is really very beautiful.
There' s Conny from the garage with my gun.
I saw your car, and thought...
Here' s your gun.
I' ve checked it out, it works fine now.
- I welded the barrel.
- Thank you so much.
Was that you in the taxi?
That was me who skidded past in the truck.
It' s a she...
Bulls- eye, right up her ass.
- My Christmas hare for the church.
World famous.
Daniel Daréus.
One of those artist types, huh?
- Has Olga laughed today?
- What?
Isn' t your hearing aid on?
- Has Olga laughed today?
- What have you got today, Lena?
This Norwegian and a Swede are watching a funeral procession.
"Who' s the dead one?"
"Don' t know", says the Norwegian, "but I think that' s him in the coffin."
- I' il put down the 65 crowns.
- Fine.
Are you the one who bought the old school?
Yes.
I knew you' d come in here.
Everyone has to eat.
Would you listen to this?
See if it' s good enough.
Want a Bingo lottery ticket?
Everyone plays "bingolotto" around here.
We had a winner once.
This is for you.
See ya!
He wanted a bottle of Jamaican, only thing that turns his girl on.
24 speeds.
Only 5, 800 crowns.
A lot of bike for your buck.
Don' t let that...
- Eeh... nothing with fewer gears?
- C' mon, don' t be cheap with yourself.
People around here can be a bit narrow minded.
I' ve always driven Yank cars.
I love the purr of an old V8, the smooth ride.
Folks get pretty bent out of shape over those wheels.
But you can' t let it get to you.
Come spring thaw, out for a drive!
- 5, 200, huh?
- Well?
Listen, I' d like to show you something you could really help me out with.
Now this is very dear to me.
- that meets every Thursday in the congregation hall.
We do a spring concert and you' re just the man to come and...
- No, no, I' m too impatient.
- Just to brush us up a little.
You aren' t cheap in that way?
- 4, 600.
Great!
Come on Thursda y, to listen.
Just to listen.
4, 200 and a sweatsuit thrown in.
See you on Thursday.
The Lord is coming Hills, sink!
- But I' m the one who runs this choir!
- Siv, he' s only coming to listen.
- What' s his name?
- Daniel Daréus.
Typical Arne, giving out orders.
I' m in charge of the choir.
We' re rehearsing any wa y.
You' re only in charge, Siv because we don' t have a cantor.
- Does Stig know about this?
- The Pastor has nothing to do with it!
- It' s all Arne' s delusions of grandeur!
- What' s the problem?
He' s just going to listen and give a little advice.
- Musicians aren' t cheap in that way...
- Arne, simmer down.
Well, if he' s coming, of course we should sing!
I' m not going to sing, neither is Olga.
Olga' s old enough to make her own decisions.
You need a fella.
Ma ybe he' s something for you.
As far as I know, he' s single.
Oh, stop it!
No, don' t worry.
I' il be there when you get home.
Yes, dinner' s ready.
But you said I could go.
I' il be home when you get there.
Welcome.
I' m Gabriella.
Come on in.
I was passing by and heard singing.
Much of it is very nice.
- We are not pros.
- But we could be much better.
- Well, within our limitations.
- I dreamt he would come.
I was passing by and...
Thank you so much.
- He said "much of it is very nice".
- Did he say "much of it"?
- Those very words?
"Much of it is very nice."
Did you hear that, Olga?
Have you listened to the cassette?
It' s me, Lena...
The Bingo lottery ticket.
Carry on.
I' il be right there.
But your ticket didn' t win.
This is my boyfriend.
You' ve got to listen to it.
See you.
You need warmer clothes, Daniel.
No you fucking don' t.
You' re not going anywhere!
Fucking slut!
For God' s sake, stop it!
Well, if it isn' t the little artist.
Get your hands off her!
Your kind don' t belong here!
- I' m warning you!
- No, Conny!
Let go!
Mind your own business!
It' s him.
I confess, oh righteous God -
- that I have sinned in thought, word and deed.
I have not loved Thee above all else nor my neighbour as myself.
Through my sins I am guilty of more than I understand -
- and contribute to the world' s negligence of Thee.
I beseech Thee, help me cease my sins.
Forgive me, in the name of Jesus Christ.
Amen.
This is a surprise.
A simple position as cantor.
Is it worth it?
Music is all I know.
But the church is cold and the salary meagre.
Take my advice, don' t do it.
- My mind' s made up.
How nice.
Welcome!
This is my wife, Inger.
It' s up to the church council, so it' il take a while.
I' d like to begin immediately.
Do you realize the job entails running the choir?
But they can' t possibly meet your demands.
Everything begins with listening.
- When do you finish?
- I' il call you later.
Imagine that all music already exists.
It' s up here, all around, vibrating, ready to be taken down.
It' s all a matter of listening, of being ready to take it down.
You understand?
- Yes.
Each person has their own unique tone, their own individual tone.
And we' re going to find it.
Arne here.
Don' t you want that with a built- in DVD, yeah...
It' s got PAL, NTSC and...
Just human voices.
Yes.
Some advice, please, on what to do.
How should I begin?
Right...
Balance.
Balance...
Yes, exactly.
The torso.
Right.
We know where our stomachs are.
Let' s massage them to wake them up.
And pat them...... and massage them.
Put your hands here...
And twist, backwards, then forwards.
Push awa y...... making a large circle.
Your fingers...
Then shake them out.
Excellent!
Listen, and give it back.
Let' s hope no one walks in on us.
Is the door locked?
Each person has his own individual tone.
Try and find yours.
Begin, slowly... to sound...
Find the harmony.
I started to think of the Pastor.
Music is about listening.
You' re so eager, Arne!
The singing will come, later.
He' s worked with the great vocalists.
And we have fun, too.
I haven' t felt so happy in a very long time!
Of course you must come, you must.
See you on Thursday as usual.
- Don' t you sing?
- No, not yet.
Later, sa ys Daniel.
- Why must you defend him?
- I' m not defending him.
I enjoy doing something new.
It' s good he takes things gently.
- Don' t deny you were defending him.
- He' s trying to get to know us.
All hold hands.
Now we' il find the source.
The core.
Let me be clear.
Either you participate, or you leave, please.
- I' m just here to listen.
- lf you sit here it affects me.
I' m doing something here that' s entirely new to me.
- And what, may I ask, are you doing?
- New faces, new sounds...
Oka y, Maestro.
There' s a great difference between people here and in the big wide world.
One must observe certain limits.
As cantor many eyes are upon you.
- What a grump!
- I' m glad it' s just us now.
Where were we?
Arms out.
We are going to the source...
Excuse me.
Hi there!
No, I don' t do renovations.
Is it a Cadillac?
He' s really good.
He sold one for 700, 000 to a Norwegian last week.
I' il call you in an hour or so.
Bye.
Yep... we were going to the source, right?
Come along.
Now?
Haven' t you understood a single thing?
About who we are!
About our lives!
All music comes from within!
Concentration!
Without concentration, nothing can emerge!
Nothing!
Have some water.
Daniel, you know... this is all so new to us.
We aren' t used to...
Coffee' s important, too.
Hell, I knew it.
Here we go!
- In on one, see?
- Now find your unique voice...... vibrating inside you.
Find your tone.
I' il take care of this.
Hello, Tore.
Arne, take it easy.
It' s only Tore.
- Give him a cookie.
- Tore, we' re not locking up yet.
Tore, here!
- Cookie?
I wan... join in.
- Tore, be a good boy now.
- Here' s a bun, with sugar on top.
- He sa ys he wants to join.
- Well, you see, he can' t read or write.
- He' s cuckoo.
- I want to join!
I know.
We must have some criterion.
I think Tore should join us.
Isn' t he your cousin, Arne?
I' ve got plans for this choir!
Don' t you see?
I' m working very hard for us!
At the spring concert, is Tore to be up there -
- next to fatso Holmfrid?
- Oh for God' s sake!
All this newfangled...
Arne, wait!
Arne is so dedicated.
Great!
An A. Erik.
Gabriella.
Now we' ve got two basses!
It pisses me off!
"Isn' t he your cousin" and "smoking outside".
Calm down Arne.
Are we running some kind of kindergarten?
Hang on!
Could I come an hour earlier next time?
I' d like you to help me.
So I can find my tone.
- Yes.
I' ve got to run.
It' s my new boyfriend.
See you!
Stig, I' ve been wondering about your voice.
Why do you sound so ceremonious doing weddings?
'Will you take this...?'
- Marriage involves a major decision.
- But it can make people nervous.
"Will you take..." People might get second thoughts, Stig.
You do use different voices in church.
At funerals, a different one.
- 'Dust to dust; ashes to ashes.'
- Are you making fun of me?
- Stig, will you take this woman?
- That' il do now.
I' m being serious, Stig.
Will you take this woman?
Can I see your shoes?
You' il have to change shoes, or get them reheeled, for the right balance.
Straighten your back.
Walk up and down a bit, and sing.
Take off your sweater.
We' il find your balance.
I know it' s there.
It just needs to be set free.
Open your throat, open your chest.
Release your sound.
I want to...
- Is there something stopping you?
- It scares me.
It' s all so much, I' m not sure I dare.
I' d like to tell you about something.
Once, during a concert there was a power failure.
Everything went black.
They couldn' t see their music, nor me.
I leave it all up to the orchestra.
They all listen to each other.
No one sees me.
That' s when I experienced it for the first time.
58 seconds.
All minds were joined.
58 seconds...
That' s a pretty long time.
Prague '82.
I was 19.
- It' s all there.
This is the great secret.
That' s when we can take down the music.
I ask myself, what is he after?
Something' s happening to people there.
We haven' t rehearsed anything, not once.
- Not even for the services?
- Nothing at all.
I' m sure of it.
What do you mean, Siv?
It feels like he' s using us for his own purposes.
I' d like you to keep attending, please.
Listen everybody, listen!
Daniel has said yes!
He can judge if we' re ready.
'Are we really going to charge?' someone asked.
The village hall costs, all venues cost.
So a concert should cost.
I thought: tickets, 100 crowns each.
It increases the product value.
Six weeks to go, to the concert.
The only valid excuse for absence is your own funeral.
I' m finished.
Now let' s rehearse.
Harmony.
Glorious is all on earth
You came here even though...
I told you to stay at home!
Don' t think I don' t know!
Wait, wait...
Careful now, for Christ' s sake!
- He' s drunk.
That' s why he comes.
- He' s dragged her away a few times.
But he beats her!
And everyone knows it.
I' ve tried talking to her so many times.
It' s like talking to a wall.
- Why doesn' t she leave him?
- He could do anything to her.
She doesn' t dare, she' s terrified.
Look at Tore there.
Now we' re in the shit.
God, it stinks!
- What did I tell you!
- Shut up, Arne.
- Arne does have a point, Lena.
Are you starting?!
Haven' t you ever shit your pants?
Come along, Tore.
Say my name, Lena.
- Tore.
- Say the other thing, too.
- What is it you want me to say?
- The three words.
- The three words?
- Yes, sa y the three words.
I love you, Tore.
What are you doing?
Nothing special.
Yup...
Shall we ride together?
Lena, I don' t know how.
You can' t learn to ride a bike on your own.
Someone' s got to hold on.
Don' t pedal yet, I' il push.
Just try and keep your balance.
- This is interesting.
Yes.
You' re the one always talking about balance.
Climb on.
- Now, hold on.
- Yes.
- You' re holding on?
- Yes!
Eyes ahead...
Don' t look back!
You weren' t holding on!
You weren' t holding on.
Six metres, Daniel.
Not bad for first time.
There' s no harmony.
Sit down.
Is there anyone here who needs to get something off their chest?
- I' ve something I' d like to bring up.
- Oh for God' s sake.
- But we' re going to have a party.
I' ve alwa ys thought that Lena has a way, that' s not good for this choir.
- And it concerns all of us.
- Lena?!
- "A wa y that' s not good for the choir?"
So I really want to be honest.
Don' t we have a responsibility to each other here in the choir?
Lena and I sing the same part, and we' re to harmonize, aren' t we?
Are we to just stand by and ignore the kind of life she leads?
Why doesn' t anyone ever object?
- Arne...
It' s not the Christian faith to party on Saturday night...... and then...
Then to stand in church and sing on Sunday morning.
Inger, is this any type of example for the young girls in the congregation?
Seeing Lena hop in and out of all these different cars.
In and out of different cars?
You know as well as I do.
The young girls might think it has something to do with love.
That that' s the way for a woman to behave.
- There, I' ve said what I have to sa y.
- Right.
Admit it, Siv you' re just jealous of Lena.
You ought to be ashamed, laughing at someone who dares be honest!
Try being honest yourself!
Tore' s pacing.
Where' s the corkscrew?
I' il go out and get Siv.
Party time!
This one' s for you, Arne!
Sin in the congregation hall, Stig.
Go- go girls - like Sodom and Gomorrah.
- I know it all!
- You know it all?
- Nothing' s happened.
You expose your breasts in the congregation hall and this is nothing?
I was a bit tipsy, dancing...
- Stop it!
Inger, you have sinned!
On church premises!
Now I' m going to sa y something I' ve wanted to say for a long time.
Something that' s plagued me for 20 years.
There is no sin.
It only exists in your head.
- There is no sin.
"There is no sin?"
I have thought.
The church invented sin.
Handing out guilt with one hand then offering redemption with the other.
It' s all a lie, hot air, to suppress people, to gain power.
Silence!
Ask for God' s forgiveness!
God doesn' t forgive, don' t you get that!
Because he' s never condemned.
- Try to be humble, Stig.
I am humble!
You think I didn' t know about it?
For years I' ve known you' ve had your pictures here.
You' ve come out here before we' ve made love...
To have a look...
Black stockings, high boots, bottoms...
To get stimulated.
It' s all right, Stig.
But don' t condemn others.
Inger, God hears you.
He hears and he smiles, you can bet on it.
The church has made a sin of sexuality.
You' ve had a need, you haven' t hurt anyone by it.
There have been a few times in bed we' ve enjoyed...
Even if we' ve never reached Heaven together, not yet.
Stop it...
Stig.
I love you.
I alwa ys have.
I' ve kept everything inside.
But not any more.
I' ve kept my mouth shut, repressed everything I' ve felt...... and seen, and heard and thought.
Come...
Come, Stig...
Jesus Christ, forgive me my sins...
- Inger...
- What?
- It never happened...
I repeat: what happened between us last night never happened.
We' ve got three new members in the choir toda y, young people.
How nice.
Good!
Very good!
That' s how it should sound!
- Yes!
One more thing, some good news: ticket sales are going well.
We' re getting a bit famous, see?
We should be sold out!
- Let' s add to our repertoire.
- A new song?
- Yes, brand new!
- Exciting.
- In time for the concert?
- Of course.
This song is for you.
It' s your song, Gabriella.
At the concert, I want you to sing this.
The solo is yours.
I can' t.
Never.
We can try it now.
We have time before mass.
But why me?
When you sa y, "I can' t" I find it hard to believe.
I' ve composed it for you.
I' ve listened to you, Gabriella.
Could I ask you something?
Why are you here, when you could...
Ever since I was a little boy, I' ve had a dream:
To create music that opens people' s hearts.
It' s still my dream.
- That' s no small dream.
- What stopped me was...
I found it hard to love people.
- Don' t think I don' t like you.
- That' s not what I think.
You' re strange.
Everyone here' s in love with you.
You must have noticed.
Lena loves you and...
I, you know, I...
I record everything you sa y.
Then I sit at home in the garage and listen to you.
Conny says he' s going to shoot you.
Take care.
Heavens, you do go on!
I' m exhausted.
Hold on tight, here.
- What are you up to?
- How do you mean?
Many in the congregation are very concerned.
How nice with a fiddler!
I can understand how the ladies in the choir could take a fancy to you.
What are you talking about?
A cantor must never manipulate parishioners.
A cantor must not exploit his office for the purpose of intimate relations.
I trust I' ve made myself clear.
One!
Not too fast.
You know where the brakes are, don' t you?
Good balance!
Let' s try a turn, and no ditch like the last time.
Fantastic!
Daniel can ride a bike!
This is fun, it is!
Now we' ve known each other for 145 da ys.
- Are you counting the da ys?
- Yes.
- Now everyone knows.
That I like you.
- I' m not doing it.
- Show Conny that you can do it.
She' s not doing it for Conny.
- Show him what she' s made of.
Please wait.
- I' m not doing it.
- We' re sold out... every ticket!
Now we can show them what we' re worth.
How can you know what' s best for Gabriella?
Shut up!
She could at least make an effort.
But of course she' s afraid of how Conny will react.
Look at Holmfrid!
Fatso' s at it, sucking up.
Christ all- mighty!
You damned bastard... what have you done, you!
I' ve had enough of you!
Fatso this, Fatso that!
You bastard!
Holmfrid!
You cowardly bastards!
You' ve laughed along...
For 35 years he' s been at it.
Every day at school...
School was one long hell.
You were alwa ys at it, Arne.
"Fatty- Fatso Sausage- boy."
You never quit, Arne...
All those years at school.
"Fatty- Fatso Holmfrid."
It is now that my life is mine
I' ve got this short time on earth and my longing has brought me here all I lacked and all I gained
And yet it' s the wa y that I chose
My trust was far beyond words
That has shown me a little bit
Of the heaven I' ve never found
I want to feel I' m alive
All my living da ys
I will live as I desire
I want to feel I' m alive
Knowing I was good enough
I have never lost who I was
I have only left it sleeping
Ma ybe I never had a choice
Just the will to sta y alive
Being who I am
To be strong and to be free
To see da y arise from night
I am here
And my life is only mine
And the heaven I thought was there
I' il discover it there somewhere
That I' ve lived my life
Ten!
Darling gorgeous Gabriella can' t you be my Cinderella?
I feel so proud.
It' s great when people recognise you.
Two people came up to me and said I was good.
It makes your eyes water.
I' ve got something...
And it' s about you, Florence.
What I want to say, I' ve never said to anyone before.
I want you to know, Florence -
- that, ever since we were at elementary school, I have loved you.
I saw the looks you gave him.
- It' s not true, Conny.
Eh?
You lie.
Why didn' t you come straight home?
I said okay to the concert.
But afterwards!
Why didn' t you come straight home?!
- You fucking slut!
- Please, Conny, just let me be...
Coffee break!
Your attention, please!
- What are you up to now, Arne?
- Here it is in black and white.
It came in today' s mail.
German, but I' il translate:
- "in the Let the People Sing choir contest" -
- "which is to take place in the native country of Mozart and music."
We compete, on stage, 28 July at 11 a. m.
Yes.
We' il all be going there.
I' ve never been abroad before!
What is it?
Does it scare you?
I' m not scared!
You can' t compete in singing.
- I agree with Daniel.
- But... it' il be fun and exciting.
- Right!
Daniel' s trying to sa y something!
- He' s already had his sa y.
- You' ve no idea...
The idea' s insane!
You have no idea.
I know!
I' ve done it!
It' s not good for you.
I agree entirely.
I just thought that...
Daniel, how do you know it' s not good for us to go to Austria?
Yes, how can you tell, Daniel?
If we are meant to do this -
- then we will do something truly different...
They' re gonna hear music unlike anything they' ve ever heard before.
That' s it, Daniel!
I just want to say that I' m leaving the choir.
- Leaving?
You can' t leave now, Siv!
- I' ve had enough, Arne.
- I thought this was a church choir.
- You mustn' t... no one' s to leave.
Siv!
- What' s happened?
I don' t understand.
- You' ve made your choice, a slut.
You won' t be here for long!
Siv, Siv, come back!
Siv, stop!
Come back!
- Let' s have a swim!
It' s too cold.
Well I' m going for a swim.
First dip of the year.
- Can' t you swim?
- Sure, I can swim.
I want to tell you something.
Not long ago...
I was really in love with a man.
My greatest wish was to share my life with him.
He worked as a doctor here.
For two years, we were together.
But he was married, with a wife and children in Stockholm.
He lied to me, all that time.
No one' s ever going to do that again.
It hurt so terribly, see?
What is it?
Daniel!
At the Church Council meeting of 24 June... yesterda y... it was decided -
- that Daniel Daréus be dismissed from his position as cantor.
There have been reports, from several people.
Extremely serious accusations.
- For example?
- I' m unable to discuss it.
The Council is conducting an enquiry.
Things have transpired which oblige me...
I am taking the choir awa y from you.
Now, please hand in your keys to the church and congregation hall.
We have nothing more to sa y to one other.
No more.
- I pity you, Stig.
- You' ve no idea what he' s done.
Rubbish!
You' re such a coward.
Firing him because the choir outnumbers your church- goers!
- My husband... firing Daniel.
- You don' t know what you' re talk...
You fire him because he reminds you of everything that you daren' t show.
It hurts you to see a man who shows you just how small you really are.
You' re not angry at him, but at what he evokes in you.
Look at yourself, for god' s sake, Stig.
Take it back, please!
Oh, my God...
I pity you, Stig.
Giving sermons on the crucifixion...
Don' t you see?
Dear, dear Stig... take it back!
It' s all over.
Daniel' s accepted and handed in his keys.
He' s accepted...
This circus is over!
- Where' s Inger?
- Not feeling well.
Attention, please.
The Church Council has dismissed Daniel effective immediately.
There will be an investigation.
Serious allegations have been filed.
He has abused his position for personal gain.
He has gone too far...
The investigation will explain all.
What "personal gain"?
Stig, no one here understands what you mean.
- Has anyone here changed their mind?
- No!
- Yes!
- Austria' s still on?
- Yes!
Next question: what shall we sing?
- Daniel, what shall we sing?
Is it too much to ask what' s going on?
- La y off, Lena!
- Keep quiet!
- Come on...
Have you slept with anyone here?
What did Stig mean?
You know what that means?
If you lie to me, Daniel, then I' il walk straight out that door.
Just so you know.
So answer me.
I want to know.
Have you slept with anyone here?
Answer!
I don' t want to be fooled again.
- You' re out of your mind, Arne!
I am over him!
But I' m not over the fact that...... none of you ever said anything!
Why didn' t anyone tell me?
You all knew.
You knew, Arne.
That he was married... had a family, children.
Don' t you see?
You were in on it, and said nothing!
Why didn' t you say anything?
The hell with all of it!
Go to Austria without me.
Daniel...
Hurry!
Lena, wait!
Get your hands off me!
I got the message!
Christ, how stupid I' ve been!
I fell for it again.
You' re here for a while, then you move on...
- I knew it!
- Lena, can I ask you one thing?
How do you know that you' re sure?
- lf you don' t like someone...
How can you be sure you don' t?
What are you talking about?
Who is it you don' t like?
- No, no...
No!
It was just an example.
Why don' t you turn it round...
"If you like someone, how can you be really sure?"
You feel happy when you see her.
- Correct!
- You think about her.
Bingo!
You' re driving me crazy!
What kind of a nut case are you?
How old are you?
- You look like a lost lumberjack.
- Lena...
I haven' t slept with anyone here, or tricked anyone, not you, not anyone!
Shall we go inside?
You are strange...
Let' s give it a try.
Answer me, Inger.
Answer!
Give me a sign that you hear me.
Wake up!
What are you looking at?
Come back to me.
I was just passing.
I thought you' d need a map, now that you' re biking so far.
To find my wa y home?
- Really?
- He' s fantastic, my grandpa.
When I was about to start school, he just had to paint in an extra angel.
That' s me.
Down in the corner.
I often see them.
Sometimes I just hear the wind...
Do you believe in angels?
If I squint I sometimes see their wings.
I saw wings on Olga and on Arne, in the last song.
I' ve seen them on Tore.
I' ve seen them on you.
You' re ready when you see them on everyone.
You can if you practise.
Lena...
I' ve known the whole time.
- Known what?
- That you' re scared.
You needn' t be scared, Daniel.
There is no death.
Ever since my parents died when I was small, I' ve known.
There is no death.
I can see them on you, Daniel.
It' s the first time I' ve made a bed for someone else.
It' il do fine.
I just need to be on my own.
Mass is cancelled.
Wait here, my sweethearts.
Mamma just has to say something.
I' ve left Conny.
I' m so frightened.
I don' t know where we can go.
- You can sta y with us.
- We' ve got lots of room.
I' il be damned!
She' s not supposed to be here!
I' m taking her home now.
You' re going to regret this.
Let' s keep our departure time secret, so nothing happens.
Bus, as we planned.
It looks as though we' il all fit into one bus.
Gabriella will have her children with her.
It' s all arranged.
Any questions?
How old can a bird get?
I' il pick you up personally, Tore.
It' s for you, Daniel.
It' s the Pastor.
Stop there.
Sit down.
You can' t imagine that a pastor could sit here, wanting to kill?
Two cartridges... one for you and one for me.
I was somebody, here.
People looked up to me.
You' ve taken everything away from me.
Everything!
I can' t show my face around here now!
Where' s Inger gone to?
Where is she?
Why did you come here?
Why come here!
Why come here?
You' ve been screwing her, you bastard!
Who the fuck do you think you are!
We were at school together, Conny.
It' s me, Daniel with the fiddle...
Water, water... - Daniel!
Oh, my God!
We two...... won' t be living together any more.
Make use of your time here.
Ask for help so you can see our children again some da y.
I don' t wish you ill, Conny.
I know you' ve done your best.
It' s strange.
We all do that.
When I was seven, we moved.
Mamma took me awa y from here.
That' s what happened.
- I' ve never felt like this before.
You...
Welcome back home.
Hello, Tore!
And you... jump up.
We' re in a bit of a hurry.
I' ve packed the things you asked for.
I also packed your favourite walking shoes.
Thank you.
That was thoughtful of you.
All aboard - we need to be off.
- I' ve got to go now.
- Inger...
Do you think we could...?
I don' t know, Stig.
Lena!
It' s me, Daniel.
I don' t want to talk to you right now.
There' s something you told me that I have to say to you.
It' s really important.
I' ve have to say it right now.
Lena!
When you like someone...
How do you know you love them?
You' re happy when you see them.
What else?
You think about him.
What else?
When you love someone you feel happy, being with him.
You feel happy, being... with her.
Lena, I can say it now.
Say it then.
I love you.
Now we' ve known each other for...
Now we' ve known each other for... 184 days.
You know what, Daniel...?
A happy thing...
I think grandpa must go to school and paint in another little angel.
This way, everybody.
Holmfrid, up in the corner.
Where' s your conductor?
He' s on his way.
It' s Daniel Daréus.
Stay put.
He' il be here.
We' re on the red carpet tonight for the premiere of Adrenaline Force.
This is Bo Laramie' s breakout role... in what is certain to become a very popular action franchise.
They have been completely ignited by the anticipation of Laramie' s arrival.
Oh, my God, this is huge, babe.
It' s a long way from pounding nails in buildings.
- Do you know all these people?
I don' t know any of' em.
- I think they think they know you, Dad.
- Yeah, I think you' re right.
Okay, honey, I want you to go out there and have a good time.
I love you.
You ready, Bo?
- Yeah.
I' il see you guys in a little bit.
Huh?
- Go get 'em, Dad!
- Thanks.
Your first action film.
How are you feeling tonight?
I' m just - really just trying to enjoy it.
And, uh, I' m excited.
- Your fans are waiting.
Congratulations.
What a night.
Unreal.
Six months ago, I couldn' t get arrested with a fresh corpse and a smoking gun.
And today I' m the, uh, "it" guy?
But you can' t buy into that.
That' s an illusion.
You know, there are primitive tribes that believe... you lose a piece of your soul every time your picture' s taken.
After last night, it' s a wonder I have any left.
- It is!
Never.
It' s not real.
Life is good.
I guess I' m just gonna keep doin' what I' m doin '.. until somebody figures out I really don' t know what I' m doin'
That sounds like a plan.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Dad.
- Mom says you run so you won' t get fat.
- Is that what she said?
Really?
Well, you know what?
Everything we have fits in half a cabinet.
- You sure it' s ours?
- It' s ours, beautiful.
- How was your run?
Good enough that the fat man and his family can go get some muffins on the way to soccer.
- Yeah.
Okay, I' m gonna put you in the cabinet.
- How are you, Sierra?
What' s goin 'on?
- Hi, Zach.
- Hi, Rusty.
- The usual?
Sure.
It' s wild, isn' t it?
You' re Bo Laramie, aren' t you?
- Oh, I' m Emily, from Ohio.
- Nice to meet you, Emily from Ohio.
Could I get your autograph?
Yeah, absolutely.
Where would you like me to sign?
Hey, Zach, let' s go, buddy.
- They just put 'em out at the grocery store.
- Thank you!
Hold this, will you, bud?
Thank you, Sierra.
- Thanks.
Can they do this?
- They did, Abby.
How dare they put Zach on the cover of a magazine?
I - He' s a minor.
Is this legal?
I' m gonna call Gill, and I' m gonna find out.
God, Bo.
My principal, the teachers.
I' m sorry you' re being put through this, Abby.
Why is Daddy in a magazine with a black thing covering his pee- pee?
- You ready to play some soccer today, buddy?
- How' s it going, buddy?
- Morning, guys.
- Good morning.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
All right, now.
I know, Dad.
Have fun.
I' il be right back, sweetie.
All right.
What are you doin '?
I' m about to watch a soccer game.
He' s a good- lookin 'boy.
He' s got a birthday comin 'up, doesn' t he?
Take a few shots.
'Cause you had no right taking pictures of my son.
- Yes, I do.
- Not without my consent you don' t, all right?
Things have changed.
You better get used to this.
I' m somebody now?
- Yes, you are.
- Now your game' s about to start.
- It' s a security risk.
Don' t take pictures of my son.
- You got it, Bo.
- Thank you.
I understand.
Sure thing, famous guy.
- You were awesome.
You did a great job, buddy.
Son of a bitch.
Take him to the car.
What did I tell you?
Not one more.
Won' t bring half as much as the ones I have of Abby changing Zach' s clothes.
Oh, are you gonna pay.
Smile, Bo.
You get that?
- Cops are on their way.
- Hey, Bo.
Hey, big shot.!
Enjoy what' s left of your weekend.
Let' s go make some money.
We' re told Laramie was released late Saturday afternoon... ordered to attend anger- management classes... as part of a plea agreement.
His people tell us the assault charges will likely be dropped... in lieu of a settlement that could easily cost... the rising star half a million dollars.
The victim, 34- year- old Rex Harper... is also demanding a public apology.
Our very own Giuliana caught up with Bo... on the set of his new action movie.
- Giuliana?
- Thanks for having me.
Bo, just so we understand what happened... you became angry at some photographers... after they were taking pictures of you at a weekend soccer game?
Mr. Harper was taking pictures of my son.
I politely asked him to stop, and he didn' t.
So you hit him?
Well, there' s a little bit more to it than that, but, yeah.
- He' s never gonna get an apology from me.
And ifhe knows what' s good for him, he' il stay away from me and my family.
- Strong words.
Yeah.
Laramie, I' m gonna destroy your life and eat your soul... and I can' t wait to do it.
Well, here' s one for ya.
You' re lucky.
Real lucky.
Ajudge orders me to spend $400 an hour on therapy... that I don' t need, and that makes me lucky?
You' re lucky you' re not in jail.
You' re not in Montana anymore, Bo.
Anger management is not about upgrading from a 20 to a 12- gauge.
The point is... you' re carrying belief systems from a previous life... that don' t fit your new reality.
Some of your old values may not be valuable anymore.
Not here, not now.
Well, I disagree.
You don' t mess with a man' s family.
And I' m not gonna change who I am... to suit my environment or your expectations.
I got to where I am by doing things my own way.
Oh, I think the judge would agree with you.
That' s not what I meant, but -
No, I know that.
Look, your, uh - your time here - it' s gonna give you the tools to better deal with situations like last Saturday' s.
And I' m considerably cheaper than Mr. Harper.
Is that it?
- For now, yes.
And, uh, if you have a problem, I want you to call me.
Thank you.
I' il see you next week.
Thanks, Phil.
- Switzerland.
- What do you mean?
This came out of the U. K., so it must be true - "Unnamed sources say...
"Laramie chartered a private jet to Switzerland.
"While there the young star reportedly underwent a penile enhancement... surprising his wife with it on her birthday."
"Big Bo"?
"The Albatross"?
- Something sexy for the bedroom, to keep it fun.
- Yeah, yeah.
- It' s nice, how they caught me.
- Y- You want to show it to me?
- Can' t keep anything a secret these days.
If it' s big like that, w - why would you want to hide it?
Be nicer to him.
Things have changed around here.
You got the stuff, huh?
Sí.
Merci.
- Este buey está zafado.
Nice legs.
What time do they open?
Does that usually work where you come from?
- Yeah, a couple of times.
- Leave!
Now!
- I thought he was kind of cute.
Loser.
- All I' m saying is they called.
Those schmucks over at Web Pics are turning this friggin 'business into a trout farm.
Celebrities getting approval over paparazzi' s photos?
That' s bullshit!
The public wants raw and real, and that' s what we give them.
Let me tell you something, my friends.
We' re the last of the real hunters.
I' il drink to that.
Now, they were the shit.
- And you are a dog.
I made bank on 'em too.
Ants crawlin 'all over my ass.
I picked her off with a thousand mil from 120 yards out.
It was beautiful.
Too bad it wasn' t really Lopez.
Nobody knows that.
Don' t start sweatin 'the small stuff, okay?
Or you' il get soft, end up like the rest of those pussies working at the agencies.
Hanging with you and Rex, who is, by the way, still the king.
Hundred and five thousand dollars for that shot of Clooney in the woods.
Yeah, Clooney' s been a real gold mine.
- How' d it go, huh?
- She' s a lesbian.
I' m gonna get a second opinion.
God, you get a lot of lesbians.
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.
- I guess you can afford it.
- What' s that supposed to mean?
You think I wouldn' t recognize the guy... that siphoned half a million dollars out of Bo Laramie?
Hey, I saw you get your ass kicked on TV.
Look, I' m a photojournalist.
- Mm- hmm.
With the exception of Laramie' s apology to me.
I like reading the tabloids.
I think they' re fun.
- I think you' re drunk.
- I think you' re cute.
Your pictures hurt people.
Do they?
- Marcy.
- Marcy... is everyone wants to have steak, but nobody wants to date the butcher.
My job is to provide a window of reality for society.
Come on.
Have you ever bought a tabloid?
- Guilty as charged.
Guilty' s bad.
little peek, huh?
See?
It' s human nature.
Look, there' s a - there' s a premiere tonight... and an after party I' m covering.
Come with me, as my guest... and, um, see things from an entirely different perspective - mine.
I' m a good listener.
- Really?
Listen to this - No.
What do you say, Marcy?
You want to have a little adventure?
- It' s beautiful.
- Yeah?
So, when - Saturday, can you come?
How' s it going, mate?
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you.
London press junket.
There was that beautiful bird on your lap and -
- Get out of here.
- Sorry.
- What the hell was that?
- Some jackass.
She bite?
Let' s roll.
Come on, let' s go!
Aren' t we going in?
You want to tell me what' s bothering you, honey?
I just think it' s interesting, that' s all.
- You were in London last spring.
My girlfriends at home get jealous... if somebody winks at their husband at the company Christmas party.
Half the civilized world wants my husband.
How do you think that makes me feel?
You know what that guy said tonight is bullshit, right?
- Yeah, I know.
I guess it' s all just new to me, you know?
It' s new to me too, honey.
You know, every day I' m learning.
- Look at me.!
Big shot!
- Look at me!
Bo.!
Bo, slow down!
- It' s all right, son.
Son of a bitch!
Takin 'the front!
Okay, Leonard.
Hold on!
Come on.
Hello, sweetie.
We need an ambulance.
Hey, Marcy.
Everything' s gonna be fine, okay?
Come on.
Everything' s fine.
They' re not hurt that bad.
I' il be right back.
Okay?
We' re finished here.
Go!
Go!
How is she?
She' s in recovery.
I had to remove her spleen.
She' il be in a lot of pain.
We' il manage that with medication, watch her very carefully.
Now, let' s talk about your little guy here.
But comas are a tricky thing, Bo.
All we can do is wait.
- Can we be left alone?
- Absolutely.
Thank you, Doctor.
Daddy.!
- Mm- hmm.
The wine - You mu - You must have put something in it -
Obviously it made you quite amorous.
It' s a shame, Marcy, you don' t remember it.
Think again!
Not only will I attach that to every porno site on the Internet...
I will make sure it finds its way to your father' s desk at the State Department.
You wouldn' t - You wouldn' t do that.
You don' t see my face on that screen.
See if I' m bluffing!
Get out of here.
Hey there, little guy.
I' m gonna come back and see you every day, okay?
All right?
One second, honey.
I' il be right back.
- Hi, Bo.
- How are you, Detective?
Brought 'em in one at a time.
What story' s that?
Well, they never deny following you.
They say they drove up on the accident... called 911 and never left until help arrived.
You hear me?
Come on, man.
Until I find someone who saw somethin 'different, that' s all I have.
What about the, uh, other driver?
He died late last night.
He never regained consciousness.
I' m sorry, Bo.
Believe me.
I' m all over this one, Bo.
I appreciate it.
The victim died, Bo.
What now?
Bo, taking these paparazzi to court is only gonna cause more headlines.
Let it go.
We' ve got bigger problems to deal with.
The studio says we get back to work or they will be forced to shut down the picture.
Five weeks, Bo.
They' re losing a tremendous amount of money.
And your production company.
Technically, you weren' t hurt.
- What' d you say?
- Uh, Bo, you' re upset.
You don' t know shit.
I' m sorry.
So, what do you want us to do, Bo?
Excellent!
Well done.
That' s a wrap, everybody.
We' il pick it up here tomorrow morning.
What you got, Jay?
Just a bunch of crap.
"Laramie' s wife on drugs."
"Star too busy to notice."
Mr. Laramie?
- Hey, Reggie.
- The studio sent me to keep an eye on things.
Well, I could use you.
- Hey, Bo.
No soccer with Zach this mor - - Hey.
- Oh, my God.
- No, that' s okay.
I' m so sorry.
- I can' t believe I just said that.
- All right?
Goddamn it.
What are you gonna do, hit me too?
That' s bullshit, man!
Yeah, Beverly Hills.
Let me have the number for a Dr. Jennifer Kelley, please.
- Help me.!
Hold on!
Laramie!
Oh, God.
Help me!
I' m here.
Reach.
- Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
What are you trying to do, kill me?
- Shut up and give me your goddamn hand!
Please.!
Hold on, man.
- What' d you say?
Pull me up.
Hurry!
Now!
I' m startin 'to feel much more in control of my anger.
Well, that' s quite a leap in progress.
Especially considering your recent tragedy.
Well, I can' t let the fact that four paparazzis nearly killed my family... affect my behavior, now, can I?
What do you mean by that, Bo?
Well, you asked me to work on something, and, uh, I did.
Well, surely you must have some feelings about what happened.
I feel cheated.
I' m angry.
Blessed.
All at the same time.
What' s this?
Ajournal.
I want you to start recording specific events that prompt your anger... and how you dealt with them in the moment.
Doing this will help you put a face on your problems.
My problems already have faces, Dr. Kelley.
Well, then you' re moving in the right direction.
Let this journal become a sanctuary for you, Bo.
My clients are having great success with it.
Really?
This shit happens way too often.
This kid never even hit the brakes.
- This guy ain' t no kid.
- They call 'em Rolex riders.
They hang out in Beverly Hills, wear expensive leathers.
He was cute.
Detective Burton, S. I. S.
- You boys mind if I sniff around?
- Knock yourself out, Detective.
Hey, why' s Special Investigations... sending a D- 2 down to a traffic accident?
He was part of a case that I' ve been working on.
I just thought I' d look around.
Here you go, sweetie.
- Thank you.
- Mm- mmm.
I' m fine.
All right?
- Oh, hi, Bo.
- Hey, Detective.
- I hope I' m not bothering you.
No, no, no.
We just got back from the hospital.
- No, no.
But thanks for asking.
So, what' s up?
Well, you remember that guy Kevin Rosner?
He was killed earlier today in a motorcycle accident.
Wh -
He was one of the photographers that was involved in your accident.
Well, that' s too bad, isn' t it?
Yeah, well, I appreciate you calling.
Bo!
Hey, baby.
What do you got?
Cops refused to release Kevin' s personal effects.
- Then what are we doin '- - Would you let me finish?
They didn' t have any choice.
Ready for the good news?
Do you mind, love?
Check this out.
Kevin.!
Even in death, they can' t shut him up.
Tell him to hold the cover.
Can you get me through to Richard?
We need to speak with him now.
Bo?
- Hey, Detective.
How you doin '?
Yeah, things are good.
Thanks.
- Let' s take a walk.
- Okay.
Listen, the other day after I hung up with you I did some digging around.
We' re dealing with real scumbags here, Bo.
This guy - Leonard Clark?
He used to be an attorney.
Is that right?
What do you think the son of a bitch does?
He turns around and sues the police department for illegal search and seizure.
Cost the city a million bucks just to make it go away.
Really.
The guy you slapped around?
He slimed his way out of an attempted rape charge.
Guess who the attorney was.
- Leonard Clark?
And by the way, you' re not the first deep pockets he got into.
- This actor, Andy Baldwin?
- Alec?
One of those Baldwin guys.
Anyway, he slaps Harper around.
Harper takes him to the cleaners... and then Harper moves into a boat in the marina.
Now, listen, Bo... until I get this thing straightened out -
Right.
Why' s that?
- Because for a couple hundred dollars... you can go to your local radio guy... and you can drop in on anybody at any time.
- Okay.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
I -
I don' t think he' s gonna get that here.
Where you at, man?
- Yeah, I just got here.
- I' m on it.
- See you in a sec.
You hear that, Leonard, you piece of shit?
Can' t let you slide.
Mr. Laramie' s orders.
- Do you mind?
- What' s going on, Reg?
- Uninvited guest.
Oh, yeah?
You sure you' re in the right place, Leonard?
Ha- ha- ha- ha.
- You heard him.
- Don' t touch me!
I' m leaving.
Listen, there' s a guy with a blue metallic Volvo station wagon -
He' s waving a gun all over the place!
We' re coming up to Western now!
His license number is ABM543.
He' s crazy!
Get somebody down here!
All units, be on the lookout for a blue Volvo wagon...
Approach with caution.
Last seen heading westbound on Sunset near Western.
- Pull your vehicle over.!
- Show me your hands.!
- Do it now.!
Right now.!
- What the hell is this?
Gun.!
And I' il let you stay up as late as you want... until 10: 00.
Do you want a new bike?
We need you to wake up.
One man is dead in what people are describing as a bizarre "suicide by cop."
The victim, Leonard Clark, pointed a weapon at several officers... who were forced to open fire... killing the man instantly.
Details are still sketchy, but police are describing the weapon... as a modified.
45- caliber blank gun... commonly used in the motion picture industry.
We' re awaiting a press conference by the authorities... and we' il bring it to you live, when it happens.
You' ve reached Wendell Stokes Photography.
You got somethin' to say, say it.
Wendell, it' s Rex.
Pick up the phone.!
Leonard' s dead.!
- It was Laramie, and I know it.
Yeah.
"The case is under investigation."
You know that.
Yeah, but at least we' il know when he' s coming.
The cops don' t go after him, Wendell... we will.
- Yep.
Oh, these are beauties.
They' il transmit to my system perfectly.
H - How are we supposed to get in?
Have a little faith, my friend.
Now, you would think people would be more careful.
- Mm- hmm.
If I don' t feel well, I' il have Ken cover my class.
Well, just call me and I' il have Reggie pick you up if there' s any problem.
Okay.
- I' il see you two for lunch at the hospital.
- Mm- hmm.
- I love you too.
- I' il see you soon.
- He' s still in stable condition.
- What you got?
- It might be a while.
We' re running a little behind.
- He' s in my trailer?
- Hey.
- That little girl outside, she said it was okay - - No, no, of course.
- Oh, good.
Geez, look at this place.
My kids will not believe this.
- You got kids, huh?
How many kids you got?
Wow.
It sounds like it.
- It' s pretty hard to miss.
- So you know what I' m talking about?
- Leonard Clark, no?
Can you believe this guy?
- Well, the guy' s a bit of a jerk.
- No, it' s all right.
Okay, here you go, Detective.
Well, thank you, Charlie.
Thank you very much.
All right.
Oh, yeah, we traced the gun here.
Charlie reported it missing.
You know Leonard Clark was here that day, right?
I heard that.
I' ve now got two dead paparazzi... that were involved in your accident.
It' s -
I don' t know, it just takes a certain kind of person... that would do something like this.
Complete and utter distortion of the truth.
Welcome to my world, Detective.
I' il tell you, Bo...
I don' t know what I would do if anyone ever hurt one of my family.
I' m running up against it on this one, Bo.
What do you think?
That' s what I think.
Rosner' s accident might not be that random.
The investigators are still looking into it.
I' ve got this gun.
Excuse me one second.
Paul sends his apologies.
- That' s okay.
How soon until I' m up?. 00 tomorrow morning.
Thanks, sweetie.
- Hey, I' m done here.
- Okay.
Oh, Bo, there is one thing, and I hate to ask.
- Of course.
- If it' s not too much trouble.
- Why don' t you use this?
- Fine.
Thank you.
- Thanks.
Maybe it' s for one of us!
- Bo!
Shut up!
What the hell are you doing?
It' s Laramie.
You say one word to the cops, and I' m coming back for the kid.
Abby?
They said that if we told anybody... that - they said they' d hurt Zach.
- They' re never gonna stop.
I' m here, honey.
I' m here.
Aegis Security.
Hey, Reg, listen, I need you to do me a favor.
- Hospital?
- Hey, Reg.
Okay?
- It' s done.
- All right.
She' s gonna be fine, Bo.
I gave her something to help her rest.
Just let her rest.
She' il sleep a good 12 hours or more.
- All right.
Thank you.
- I' il call you.
How you doing, fellas?
This is Deputy Wilson.
Burton said you might need some extra security.
- I appreciate you guys coming out.
- Happy to do it.
We' re gonna be out here all night, walk the perimeter every hour.
- Nah, she didn' t.
I know you got something up your sleeve.
The idea of going in there, Wendell... was to protect ourselves.
If we were worried Laramie was coming after us before, we have guaranteed it now.
Why don' t we just call the cops?
And tell them... we broke into his house... you attacked his wife... and that we would like some protection?
You' re a moron, Wendell.
You' re an absolute moron!
The bitch was all over me.
Go home!
See if Laramie' s found the cameras.
I gotta think this through.
I' il call you later.
- What' s up with the light?
- Gonna have to see some I. D.
- Ain' t that big- ass sign enough I. D. for you?
- License and registration.
- Just the I. D., please.
There you go.
Guys always messin 'with me.
Always messin 'with me.
- What' d you say?
- I said, 30 minutes or it' s free.
Go on.
- Move on.
I' m goin 'Not waitin' for y' all.
What' s going on, man?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
What do I owe you for the pizza?
Just send down one of them bad white bitches, and you can have all the pizza you want.
- All right?
- Yo, thanks a lot, man.
Put one pie inside, the other one to the cops out front, will you, please?
- Have a good night.
- Good lookin 'out!
Yeah, it' s Burton.
How' s Vic comin 'with that Leonard Clark tape?
No kidding.
Tell him to cue it up.
There you go, chief.
Well, I' il be a son of a bitch.
- Copy?
I can give it to you on DVD.
I' m gonna go wake up Laramie.
You' ve reached Wendell Stokes Photography.
Wendell.
Rex.
I got a plan.
I' il be at your place at 8:. 00 a. m. sharp.
And call me ifhe leaves his house.
Hey, Wendell.
What the hell are you doing here?
Aw, shit.
Wait a minute.
Get me Traffic.
- Good morning.
Listen, fellas, thanks for helping out.
Brought you some hot coffee and a dozen doughnuts to start your day.
- Good m -
'Cause, uh, I can see your car.
I - I' il let you in.
I was in the shower.
Were they okay?
- They were great.
- I got a great night of sleep thanks to them.
I got something I' d like you to take a look at.
It' il only take a minute.
- Great.
What is this?
Impound found some video equipment... in the back of Leonard' s car.
Seems he was wearing a miniature camera when he came to the set.
Why are we watching this?
Best part is the end.
Okay, now... watch this very closely.
There.
It' s a jacket.
And there was something about that jacket... that was bothering me.
And then it hit me.
The boys at the crime lab prepared this for me.
Now, you' il notice that in the first shot... the lapels are facing away from us.
In the second shot... the lapels are facing towards us.
I was wondering how the jacket removed itself from its hook... and turned itself around.
You see, the button- cam is all one shot - it' s unedited, uninterrupted.
And Leonard left his car and came back only once.
You know what I think?
I think someone on that set... planted the gun.
Excuse me.
Burton.
You don' t want your disc?
Keep it.
We got the original.
Ma' am, my name is Detective Burton.
I' m from the Los Angeles Police Department... and I' m here to talk to you about the night of April 18.
They lied to you, Detective.
They caused the accident that night.
Then why the hell didn' t you come forward with this information before?
I need two units to pick up Rex Harper on suspicion of rape.
Berth 40, slip seven at the marina.
The suspect is a white male, about six feet tall.
Both units are code two.
Units already dispatched to both those locations... responding to anonymous 9- 1- 1 calls.
10- 4.
What the -
Laramie.
I want all of this glass bagged up, Jerry.
- What do you got, Tim?
Looks like the perp came through the window.
We got a bloody handprint on the wall.
Blunt force, trauma to the head, no sign of a struggle.
Haven' t found a weapon yet.
Guy' s a bit of a freak, huh?
What' s this?
This is a live feed into Laramie' s house.
Press that record button.
Call the Malibu Sheriff s Department.
- Code three!
Did you hear me?
- Yeah!
Come on, pick it up.!
Come on, Laramie!
Took the bait, huh, Rex?
Come on!
- Huh?
Ohh!
- Detective?
- He is?
Yes, he is.! Just find a way out.!
I' m on my way.!
He' s in!
He' s in!
What the hell is going on?
Damn it!
You' re in a lot of trouble, Rex.
The bat was a nice touch, wasn' t it?
You' re going down for Wendell' s murder.
- You can' t do th - Ohh!
- What can' t I do?
Ooh, the cops are here.
Okay.
This worked out so perfect, Rex.
I don' t think I could' ve written it any better myself.
It' s just a shame I can' t tell anyone.
I can tell you, can' t I, Rex?
I feel the need to share.
Bo.!
Upstairs.!
Huh?
Detective, thank God you called me.
You - You saved my life.
Wait a second!
He almost killed me.
Come on, now, Bo.
Give me the gun.
It' s over.
- Just put the gun down.
Yeah, yeah.
Come on.
Get this piece of shit out of my house.
Get up.
Come on.
Get him out of here.
- Photographer, my ass.
I' il be out in a week.
Just another great story for Rex Harper.
Come on.
Mr. Harper, what were you doing here?
- Any response to the rape allegations?
- What about Wendell Stokes?
Let me through.
Get out of my way!
I' m headed towards him now.
Can you hang on?
Hospital.
This is Bo.
Hi, Daddy.
Oh, my boy!
- Hi, Daddy.
Hi!
- I missed you too.
- Hey, Matthew.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.
This is my wife Abby.
- What do you say, Zach?
- Oh, yeah?
- I will.
Nice to meet y' all.
Y' all have a good night.
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right, son, I' m gonna go take some pictures.
Sweetheart, see you in the car.
Little baby girl.
Beautiful.
- Are you ready, honey?
Okay.
Hey, Bo!
Packin 'on a few pounds there, Laramie?
Looks good on me, doesn' t it?
Ray, you wanna lose your mouthpiece again?
Come on, use your jab!
Box the damn guy, come on!
That' s it, that' s my little brother!
Jab!
Jab!
Come on, Uncle Ray.
That' s it, little brother.
He' s getting to you, Ray.
- Left hook.
You see what happens when you listen to me?
- Way to go.
- Thanks.
Hey, you do not belong up here, all right?
I' m not gonna tell you again.
Go wash your hands and make yourself invisible.
Pete, she' s your daughter.
Who' s she gonna help, huh?
- Crisco, can I get a hand over here?
On the way, Mr. K.
Come on!
Hey, do you know who you are out of all the girls in the world?
And what' s she gonna do when she grows up?
- Kick butt and break hearts.
The world' s an oyster and you' re a pearl.
Pearls are pretty, and they' re tough.
And pretty tough can do anything.
Remember that.
OK, Uncle Ray.
Hey, Mr. Abel.
- Hey, how are you, sir?
- Good morning, Mr. Abel.
- Yeah, beautiful.
Coffee.
Where' s my coffee?
It was not a question the first time I asked for it.
You told me last week, "absolutely, positively no coffee", and I absolutely, positively believed you.
It' s nothing major, but we should get credit for the next fight.
Memo from finance:
- Did you take care of my bookie?
I also printed out your e- mail, restocked your bar, hosed down Mel Harris.
Numbers:
Top drawer, left side, all you have to do is sign off on them.
You see, that' s why I' m the boss, Kallen.
I would send myself roses.
Well, roses die and you might be allergic, but thanks for thinking of you.
LaRocca' s event briefing, where do you want that?
In the conference room.
And don' t stick the cutout in the corner.
Put it someplace Sammy can see.
I hate it.
They look like Homo sapiens or something.
They are Homo sapiens,
Kallen speaks.
And from a mile away.
- Am I contagious or something?
She just gets kind of shy around you.
I' m sorry you' re unhappy with the standee, but we only went with the shot because your guys approved it.
If I say the shit' s shit, it' s shit.
I mean, they told me that you signed off on it, Sammy.
I don' t care what happened.
You have 48 hours before the fight.
I want the two faggots fixed.
I mean, who the hell does Sam LaRocca think he is?
He is...
With a bank account.
He is this.
An $80 shoe?
He is the gum on the bottom of my shoe.
That' s what Abel and LaRocca are.
They' re the gum, you' re the shoe.
How come they walk all over you?
Get a little older, work a little longer, you won' t be so judgmental then.
You think I like working for idiots who take advantage of me?
That' s easy for you to say.
This is not the best job you ever had.
Boxing makes all the other shit bearable.
I' d be the first in line to bend over so LaRocca and Abel could kiss my ass.
OK, don' t get upset with me just because you know that I know how smart you are.
So now you think smart is all there is to it?
That your brain can just plot the best course and your life just goes there?
The world is not an oyster.
It is a smelly tank full of dirty water and sharks.
It is not that easy to swim.
Jackie, you need to get real about where you are, which is stuck.
You can' t even see the glass ceiling from here.
Find an elevator, press some buttons.
At least the only way out is up.
Clean towels, we need more clean towels.
Bad break, Rex.
Bad break?
Come on, you saw it.
You would' ve won if you hadn' t run out of gas.
You train serious, you could have a career.
I would' ve given you a draw.
If day- old shit shook like an AK- 47.
Shut up!
You can' t say dick that wouldn' t piss me off more.
It' s all good.
Mr. LaRocca, it' s adrenaline.
- Hey, Jackie.
I' m only interested in the 13th.
Lose tonight and you' il be waving bye- bye to your career, your fan club and the free hoochie mamas that go with it.
What are you selling?
Sorry to interrupt, but it' s showtime.
Let' s get out of here.
Come on, you can do this.
Get your hands up, you bum!
He' s got no left hand.
What' s going on?
Get off the ropes!
OK, OK.
- Forget this guy Greene.
No more, no more.
He' s dead.
No, he' s good.
It' s like he didn' t bother to show up.
And if I know Sammy, he already wrote the obituary.
- See you, Gavin.
Excuse me.
Jacqueline.
- Let me buy you a drink.
Bowie, hi.
Can I get a wine cooler and whatever Gavin' s drinking whenever he' s ready?
- Like that dress.
- The cleaner' s shrunk it.
- I' il send a thank- you note.
They' re good.
- Do we have to do this now?
We' re not talking.
Stop it.
Listen, if I was a man trying to close a deal, you wouldn' t say that.
Don' t throw sex in my face.
I can' t have a regular conversation with you.
You' re afraid to have a regular conversation with me.
You' re Mr. Irresistible.
I wish.
Kallen!
Come here.
I gotta go.
There it is.
For the pride of Puerto Rico.
Promise me you' il wear this for the championship bout.
- Oh, yeah!
J. Lo' s coming to the Coliseum next month.
I want me and Pedro front and center.
- Done and done.
No, the doctors are busy stitching up Greene.
Unprofessional pussy didn' t even bother to give the fans a decent fight, nothing.
He' s out of the picture.
Pedro, I' m a man who hates defeat, but I' m not too proud to be candid.
You won because you worked and Greene didn' t.
He' s a lazy- ass fighter, and lazy- ass always loses.
That' s a fact.
Right, half- pint?
Well, I' m...
I' m not sure why Devon lost.
Maybe he just felt insecure about his corner.
You know, boxing is a team sport.
If a boxer doesn' t feel support in his corner, sometimes it comes out in the ring.
Listen to the Barbie doll with the glass balls.
What do you know about support?
What do you know about boxing?
Executive assistant.
You wipe lrv Abel' s ass for a living.
I cover lrv Abel' s ass for a living.
And I know as much about boxing as either of you.
- Nothing.
Forget it.
You talk like you think you can do what I do.
Do you think you can do what I do?
- Greene' s contract.
You don' t want it?
I' il make it easy.
- I don' t have a dollar.
I' il lend you a dollar.
I' m gonna forget what you said since you don' t know what you' re talking about.
Because if you did, you' d know it don' t pay to shoot your mouth off at me.
I just bought a boxer for a buck.
I think it pays pretty well, Sam.
I' m not keeping him.
I' m not keeping Greene.
It was a thing that became a thing.
Sammy insults everybody.
You' re gonna call him, make up, kiss his ass if you have to.
If anybody asks about Greene, it was a joke, a little parlor trick that you and Sammy played.
You lost your temper, you said a few ridiculous things.
You set it right.
Sammy won' t think you' re trying to grow a brain on me.
It wasn' t ridiculous, what I said.
And you shouldn' t be drinking that coffee.
Welcome back to the live weekend edition of the Reese Report,
Fight fan or feminist, you' re going to love this story,
After watching Devon Greene crawl off the canvas, fight promoter Sam LaRocca managed to lose his boxer and his ego in a round of verbal sparring with Coliseum employee Jackie Kallen,
LaRocca thought he had Kallen in the corner, but she outmaneuvered him and wound up walking away with Greene' s contract,
The price tag?
That' s platinum stuff,
You couldn' t write a check big enough for the look on LaRocca' s face,
It was priceless, and I enjoyed it for free,
Renee, it' s me.
Turn on Channel 28.
Hey, Sam, do you know what a coup d' etat is?
I' m Gavin Reese for the Reese Report, See you next week,
Girl, what the hell happened to all his money?
His phone' s disconnected, so I had to come.
I got here, I was fine, and then I wasn' t fine.
So you called me for blackup.
Like I need Gangster lncorporated in my life.
Like any of this makes any sense.
I' m more scared not to do this than to do it.
Devon is a ranked boxer.
God practically dropped him in my lap.
I might as well spit in the face of destiny.
Now he' s your destiny?
Devon, are you in there?
We failed.
He' s home.
Devon, did you know your phone' s not work...?
Get the shit.
- We didn' t.
We just...
Anyway, we came by to say hey.
And you' re busy, so we' il come back.
Give my man your bag!
There' s just enough tokens in there for my laundry.
A chump?
Man, come here!
Man, you done messed up my high.
Let' s go!
- I don' t forgive you.
"Where' s my rock, bitches?"
What about that guy, the way he waxed the floor with both their asses?
He was a thug who out- thugged another thug.
A thug- and- a- half if you count your boy Devon, who is pathetic, Jackie!
- Call me later.
I' m going to see my cousin Malik.
I don' t know why you mess with me, all these criminals out here, man.
Oh, hey, Luther Shaw.
- I know you?
Do you have a minute for a cup of coffee, a beer?
Yeah.
Yeah, whatever you drink.
Listen, I know this is unusual.
Believe me, I don' t make a habit of bailing strangers out of jail.
And I' m not.
I' m just a person taking a chance.
You might be interested in who I am and what I have to say.
If you' re not, I totally understand.
If, on the other hand, you are, my car' s parked around the corner.
I' m harmless.
Really, the worst I could give you is a ride.
It was brutal, you know, it was beautiful the way you fought.
You boxed.
Pull over right here.
You gotta be.
I came to see...
Look, I didn' t know he was doing crack, OK?
Another black man bites the dust.
- What' s up?
My name is Jackie!
Crazy broad.
Now, Luth, we ain' t saying that you ain' t bad.
We know that, but don' t be selling us some bullshit, because you know you ain' t mopped the floor with no Devon Greene.
I' m telling you, man, I gave that fool an old- fashioned, project ass- whupping.
I' m telling you, his partner tried to get brave and sneak me.
I had to dust his ass off too.
- Go home.
You didn' t let me finish.
It must seem a little out there.
All right, way out there.
But that is where all the good stuff is, Luther.
Like talent, and you...... you' re talented.
So this chance you call yourself taking, why you taking it on me?
Because I' ve been around boxing my whole life.
I know it like the back of my hand.
- I got potential?
If you took me serious, we could be driving Jags and sporting Versace.
You' re a woman.
- In the fight game, you are.
But I' m used to hard.
I am.
Do you want to work together?
You want to make a deal?
- Make a deal?
You never managed nobody in your whole life.
How you gonna front me, you can' t front yourself?
You' re nine- to- fiving it.
I' m good with budgets.
I can read them.
And I can read you, Luther, and I know you want to do this.
Maybe I' m interested.
Maybe I won' t.
You' re the one that' s gonna have to wait and see.
When you pay your tickets, you can register your vehicle.
Basically, it' s what you call an "all there is to it" situation.
Mister, when you pay your tickets, you can register...
- Hey, Felix.
Jackie Kallen.
We spoke on the phone.
Remember?
Hey, Cynthia, I' m breaking.
So you say this boy is good, huh?
Well, good is a dime a dozen.
Oh, no, he' s better than good.
He' s the bomb.
I got out of the game for a reason, you know.
Yeah, I know you had a stroke in '96.
I was sorry to hear about that.
The stroke didn' t do nothing but clear my head.
Look, I ain' t got time to waste training no cash registers in it for the money.
That' s a wonderful sentiment, and I totally agree.
Although ultimately, boxing is a business.
It' s a sport first.
You know, learn your craft, pay your dues.
Money will come, and it will go.
That' s why they call it "cash flow".
Felix, this kid reminds me of Marvin Hagler.
It' s just nonstop punches.
He is the real deal.
I wouldn' t have troubled you otherwise.
Ray- Ray Kallen' s niece.
All right.
I' il take a meet.
Felix.
Luther may just...
He may be just a... tiny bit raw.
Well, raw' s workable.
Rotten isn' t.
Look, Felix, I don' t know what to tell you.
- Hey, Felix, it' s traffic, it' s rush hour.
This time every day.
Hey, Luther!
There he is.
Felix Reynolds.
This tired- ass old man is gonna be my trainer.
Lady, I thought you said you had a plan.
Let me see your stance.
- Oh, well.
- Next?
A brat?
He is it.
Hey, Felix!
Now, Luther has something to say to you.
Look, old man, hold up.
No disrespect intended, but what have you done?
Who have you trained?
Let' s hear some actual ring experience.
You first.
Yeah, he packs a helluva punch like you said.
Combinations need tightening.
But he' s strong, got a great feint, and he' s a southpaw like Hagler.
He could make some noise in the middleweight division.
Time, boys.
Well, if he can learn to be a switch hitter, fight from the right- hand stance as well as the left,
- Left, right, whatever.
- It was all right?
- It was better than all right.
But you gotta get in shape, you gotta get in boxing shape, right?
Yeah, your body' s strong.
Your mind...... gonna need a whole lot of discipline.
Ain' t nothing wrong with my mind.
The ring.
Get it at 5: 00.
Oh, no, I don' t get off of work till 6.
In the morning.
Is it cheaper?
It' s available.
Five o' clock in the morning?
Man, you can forget that.
You gotta leave some room for sleep.
Haven' t you slept enough, son?
In three years, I pay you 2...
Listen.
Three years, 250 a week, then I recoup that amount from your winnings.
You heard what the lawyer said.
She' s making an investment in you.
Well, she ain' t got to worry.
You bring it all on.
I' m gonna squash whatever you send my way.
Are you nuts?
Does fair work?
No?
OK.
OK, what about this?
You give me 1, 250, I throw that in for free.
Please don' t screw me beyond that point.
I have kids.
How the hell you been?
Hey, Luth, look here.
This here is Kevin Keyes, the best cutman in the business.
- Good to meet you.
- Mouke what?
It' s Ugandan.
It' s easier.
I' m gonna take you out, Africa.
Monkey' s ass always talks shit.
Off the ropes!
Off the ropes!
Time.
Now you see what the hell I' m telling you about your jab?
Stop street fighting.
- It ain' t his rhythm I' m worried about.
In a minute, when I say again.
I put him in with a bigger man so he' d learn how to move.
Hey!
- Hey!
Come on, now.
I' il toss your black ass back out on the street!
You think I' m playing with you?
I ain' t playing with you, boy!
Hey, Luther, look at me.
Look, look.
- Yeah, I' m all right.
Hey.
That is not helping him.
Yeah, well, I' m trying to teach the boy how not to use his fists.
What do you suggest?
Handcuffs?
Your uncle Ray- Ray.
He died about a year after that was taken.
Hey, I' il start a scrapbook for you as soon as we get our first fight.
So did your dad start you in boxing?
No.
Counselor, juvenile hall.
In your lap.
And your dad?
May he rest in peace.
Who the hell knows, man?
Do you have any brothers and sisters?
He' s a year older.
They separated us, so we grew up apart.
I see him when I see him.
It' s no big deal.
I' m being straight with you.
Who were you beating up today in the gym?
- You found your temper.
Look, I go off sometimes, all right?
It' s just how I am.
It' s not a problem.
The problem you don' t have already got in your way, and you haven' t thrown a punch in a pro fight.
I mean, don' t you wanna win, Luther?
You know, you got all these expectations.
What are you gonna do if this don' t work out?
It' il work out, Luther.
You just have to let yourself trust me.
I am not the enemy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up, old man, I ain' t into no S & M stuff.
Marvelous Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Robinson?
You another young wannabe fighter, come a dime a dozen, trying to look pretty.
Start with the basics.
I' il tie down your right arm so you can learn to throw a left.
You gotta learn to be balanced on both sides.
Fight somebody that know how to handle a southpaw, better be ready to show him something different.
Let me see it.
- OK, coach.
You know there' s a powder for that.
I want a 6: 30.
Yeah, and I want a blowjob every hour on the hour.
Is that why you' re acting like such a dick?
All right, dig it in, that' s right, dig it in.
To the body, to the body, to the body.
Combination.
All right, push him off, push him off, push off.
Jump right back on him.
Now, Kallen and this amateur monkey she scraped off the street, Shaw, you said they were nothing.
He' s been training with Reynolds.
He' s been kicking the shit out of some guys in the gym.
That bitch does not find a fight in this town, or nowhere near it.
Make it understood.
Anybody puts Kallen' s boy on a card puts his own ass out of business.
Luther Shaw.
S- H- A- W.
No, you can' t call me back.
No, it' s his manager.
I haven' t thought about strapping one on, mister.
Have you?
Well, I think you have a really nice voice too.
I do.
But I can' t cash those compliments at a bank.
I don' t need a date.
What I really need is a fight for my boxer.
Jackie Kallen for Crisco Cohen.
No, he does know who I am.
Did you hear me?
I' ve known him since we were kids,
Are you listening?
- All right, baby. - to our trio of precious gems,
Ruby, Emerald and Sapphire,
All that plastic.
It' s a wonder she doesn' t melt in that spotlight.
Crisco, it' s me, Jackie Kallen.
I got a boxer.
You drove 200 miles to tell me that?
You couldn' t pick up the phone?
Four times.
Yours ain' t the only number I gotta call.
How' s Judy?
I have never cheated on her.
I just come to these joints for relaxation.
I remember that, Crisco.
How do you think I found you?
- Yeah, well...
- Well...
Good luck.
- Luther Shaw.
See what he can do.
We' il never get a fight in the Midwest as long as Sam LaRocca lives and breathes.
Too bad.
I can' t believe you have the nerve to shirk me off.
My father taught you everything you' il ever know.
Pete Kallen is the only reason you are where you are today.
Pete would spin in his grave if he could see what you' re doing.
Look, stick to what you know.
You' re a secretary, for chrissake.
And you' re a married man addicted to strip joints and God knows what else.
I am sure I could find out.
- No.
I' m thanking you in advance because I know that you' re gonna help me the same way my dad helped you.
What the hell is that?
It' s a female disease.
Most women would' ve made something up.
I' il probably only need a few days sick leave because the procedure I' m having, it' s really just minor surgery.
That' s good.
Where is the operation?
I' il probably just have it in my doctor' s office downtown.
Well, that' s a little out of the way, isn' t it?
Unless you mean downtown Buffalo.
How long am I in this business?
Long enough.
Nothing goes behind my back.
It wouldn' t get back to me?
I don' t have a brain.
You also don' t have a job now unless you stop with this silly extracurricular bullshit.
Now, you will stop, or I' il fire your ass.
And you' il lose your pension, your benefits, everything I let you work for.
Trust me, Kallen, you don' t want this kind of kaput.
I' d rather have that kind of kaput than your kind of stupid.
And remember, use your jab.
- Why I gotta be nervous?
You' re nervous.
Use the energy, Luther.
This guy' s all that stands in your way of the next guy.
Knock him out.
Oh, gotta get our picture.
OK, fighters only.
And get the three of us in and make this great.
OK, just this once.
Jab.
Don' t let him tie you up.
- Let him go.
Hands up, hands up.
- Got him!
It' s over!
That was beautiful.
That was beautiful.
Nice work on the jab.
That was great.
Yeah, he did all right.
Hold on, hold on.
Whoever it is, nobody act surprised that we won.
OK?
- Come on in.
Hey.
Oh, hey, guys, this is Crisco Cohen.
The one that put us on the card.
- Jackie said you weren' t coming.
- Jackie says things.
I' m a promoter.
We don' t read punches in the paper.
- Nice fight.
- Thanks.
- How you doing?
- Sorry, Felix.
I didn' t know you were back.
- Thank you.
Just like I said.
Better than good.
- Here it is.
Hey, wait a minute.
What are you doing?
I book.
Yeah.
We need local exposure.
You need an A- plus story.
I' m handing you one, exclusively.
It' s not algebra, Gavin.
Jackie, you against LaRocca makes a great, quaint anecdote.
Don' t make a mission out of it.
So, what, you' re trying so hard not to say is that it' s a man' s world?
I don' t have to say it.
But I should worship from afar.
God forbid I use anything from the neck up.
He has to climb up the card before I hot- dog him.
- What' s your rush?
Or maybe I quit.
As if you didn' t know.
The point is, I can' t wait for you to decide if Luther is newsworthy.
Luther Shaw weighs in at...... 159 pounds on the dot.
Here you go.
- He' s heavier since Buffalo.
Thank you so much.
Don' t drink that.
I' m serious.
I' il get you another one.
Hey there, Mathias.
Hi.
Listen, I saw your last fight, and wow.
That was one beautiful left hook.
Oh, oh, sorry.
Oh, thanks.
I just wanted to say may the best man win.
No.
He don' t like it down there.
Jump on him, that' s right.
Get up on him.
Beautiful jab.
Come on.
- Turn around and box.
Can you continue, Mathias?
- It' s over.
Way to go to the body, huh?
- That' s the way to work downtown.
- Get them off.
Oh, kid.
Thanks.
OK, well, that' s my job...... to see shit coming.
Neutral corner.
Four or five more miles.
Come on, grab my hand.
Come on, keep turning.
- Oh, better than great.
Terrific.
It' s over.
No.
Why?
All right, no elevator, but the rooms are huge.
Electric' s included.
The fireplace burns real wood.
Don' t ask me why.
You know, I hope I can afford it.
I don' t even remember what I did with those.
This is the lease agreement for you to look over.
It' s the usual, first and last.
Envelopes, stamps, stationery, all in here.
So how come you don' t have any kids?
It just never came up, the opportunity.
I guess.
Oh, thanks.
Luther, I think you' re going to want to get renter' s insurance.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Listen, Jackie...
Man, this is embarrassing to admit, but, you know, guys like me...
I don' t know nothing about tax forms and lease agreements, insurance or whatever.
Hell, man, I never even voted.
In my former line of business, I dealt with cash.
It' s either cash on the barrel, or I' m gonna hit you with the barrel.
Forget about it.
Luther, you don' t need to be ashamed or embarrassed about anything, OK?
All kinds of people don' t know all kinds of shit.
I can really help you with this stuff.
We could fill those forms out togeth...
What was that for?
For everything.
We' re the new kids on the block, we expect to be picked on, but we don' t run from anybody.
I can' t say the same for some people.
Middleweight World Champion Pedro Hernandez?
Hernandez claims he' s hungry for a worthy opponent.
Everybody knows Luther' s that guy.
I mean, what, to him, Luther' s the invisible man?
Oh, but I guess it' s hard to see someone when you' re running away from him, especially if you' re running scared.
Now, Pedro Hernandez won the middleweight crown in devastating fashion against a great ex- champ.
Luther, with only 14 fights, do you think you can beat him?
I can, I could, and I most definitely would.
I' d probably knock him out if he didn' t faint first, Pedro.
Well, there' s only one way to see how this cliffhanger will end.
Don' t miss what you can see here with me.
Exclusively.
You' re our local guy.
As for Pedro Hernandez, if you' re watching,
Close your eyes
- What for?
- Just do it
Close your eyes and teII me what you see

Man can' t be Iike he was in the beginning
Everyone is in confusion Iooking for what can' t be found

This morning I was sleeping and he came in

I went to the kitchen and there' s no fucking fire anywhere
He just does it to get your attention It' s the only reason
You twist everything, so that everything I say is fine
Listen, I' ve got an idea
I thought of something
I saw something on TV There was a professor, a psychologist
He took his own problem child to a shooting range
Since then, they' ve hung out together It' s about communicating

I' ve analyzed you
What' s that?
I' ve analyzed you
You' ve analyzed me?
You' re a homosexual, although you don' t know it yourself
What the heII do you mean?
Since mom died none of your relationships have Iasted more than a month
And when you have sex with a woman, it' s always from behind
And anaI so you don' t have to see her face
So the woman is there just so you can spit at and humiliate her
That' s the thing And so
This whole gang- bang thing is aII about -
- you guys getting closer to one another when you stick your penises in the poor, stupid girl' s bodily openings
So you can rub your penises against one another
What the fuck do you know about that?
If one of you is in one hole and the other is in the other hole then you meet in the middle
- There' s just a Iayer of skin between you - Is that so, you fuck?
You you haven' t even held a girl' s hand before
You know nothing about it Listen
Who played with doIls when he was smaIl?
Who wanted to have a dress when he turned five?
And why was that?
- I' ve analyzed that as weII - Have you, professor?
And what did you conclude?
I pretended the doIls were mom
I love you
I love you
I love you I do I love you
You know what Iinks those that do the sickest, most disgusting things?
AII of those who torture, rape and start wars?
AII of them, every single one, is a man
Do you understand why I don' t want to be one?
Forget it, forget it Just move on, smile and wink
- You can shut up now!
- The slightest mistake and it' s over
- You' re training aII wrong - And you' re so good at it

Give you solace
I played in a hard rock band Heavy metaI
Shit, it was it was Ioud
We' re talking about '83 or' 84
We made a record It wasn' t exactly number one that year
But for some inexplicable reason
Sometimes in Iife you have to be Iucky
WeIl, there was an American IabeI that heard us and became interested in us
And brought us, Iike, the boys, over
We went over there
My mom comes from the USA She comes from Sacramento in California
We were a support band for Hanoi Rocks and
She' d received a grant so she could be trained as a nurse and Mötley Crüe
At roughly that time, Reagan became president
And his government completely changed education policies -
- so that among other things they canceIled the grant
This meant mom couldn' t afford to study to be a nurse
This is disgusting!
Please, I don' t want to do this anymore
Stop filming Stop!
I told you I didn' t want to Please, cut it out
Just fucking Ieave me!
I don' t want to talk!
I did something I planted a tree
I picked a fruit
Hi
Because deep in the darkest forest in there, there is a speciaI kind of tree
I picked a fruit Iike that
It Iooks Iike a Iittle heart
And when you hold it in your hand it beats
So I took it to your schooI playground
So tomorrow when you go there, a tree wiII have grown
You can sit under that tree, in the shade and hide
Because when you sit in the shade of that tree then none of the big, nasty boys can see you
They can' t touch you
When you sit in the shade of that tree, you' re invisible
They can' t see the tree either
Because it' s invisible
Only you can see it
Then no one can hurt you Little one
I' m not a virgin here
I' m not a virgin here
But, here
Here, in between
No one' s ever touched me there

Bastard kid!!
Mum?
Jocke...
If I hear a peep out of you, I am going to kill your mother!
Mum...
This hag seems to be utterly dead.
We also found a brat.
He' s screaming like crazy.
Then we found a note that says "forgive me" or some shit.
What do you want us to do?
Wait for the ambulance and the backup.
You pissed all over me!
Sieg heil!
Sieg heil!
Racist!
Forever!
Nazi!
Forever!
Come on, he' s just a child.
Sit the fuck down!
Remember the guy I hooked up with?
What a novice.
He didn' t even dare hold my hand.
Three strokes and he' d cum.
Maybe he was just shy.
Shy my arse.
Want to go to H& M?
I saw the cutest panties there.
"I saw the cutest panties in H& M.
Let' s go there. "
Who invited you, faggot?
Watch your mouth or I' il crush your skull.
Who do you think we are?
You haven' t got much to show.
Easy.
What are you saying, twat?
Nerd.
Sieg heil!
Sieg heil!
Watch out, you friggin 'whore!
It' s those damned skinheads.
Is that Lasse?
What' s he doing?
What are you doing, Nazi pig?
Shut up or I' il fuck you, Paki.
You shut up!
Tell me you' re a whore!
Damned skinheads!
You bloody...
Fucking coward.
No!
Come on.
Jocke!
Fuck!
Jocke!
Helen?
Could you give me a hand?
Shit, you scared me.
Lift her up carefully.
Easy now.
Wake up, Helen.
The cops!
I' il find somewhere else to crash.
You can sleep in my room.
It' s quiet in there.
I got a bit of a cut.
Get your mum to bandage it.
Jocke, you want a swig?
I' m good.
It warms your entire body.
Ray will spend the night here.
Ray will spend the night here.
Who nicked my Armani shirt?
I don' t know.
You don' t think I can smell the glue?
Sara, you' d better not be sniffing it.
I told you to quit doing that.
It fries you brain.
I haven' t been sniffing any.
It was Kenat up by the drugstore.
He made Petra either sniff some glue or take a shot of horsch.
Yeah, horse.
The next time he bothers you, just tell him I' il cut his throat.
I can take care of myself.
Yes, I can see that.
But the next time you touch my shirts...
You have so many.
What the hell is that?
Who' s that lying in my bed?
Why, that' s Tiipa, our neighbour.
Poor thing has a drinking problem.
Why did you put him in my bed?
Tell him to go lie in a trash can where he belongs.
As if you give a shit.
You have to get up.
We' re going to bed.
But we haven' t finished the film.
Come on, Petra.
It' s time to wake the hell up.
Get out of here.
Check out these tits.
That' s silicone.
Anyone can see that.
They' re hard as a rock.
I wonder who gets to do these chicks?
The guys with money.
The guys who have cash.
This watch is pretty neat.
Patek Chillip.
No, it' s called Patek Phillippe.
Alex has one of those.
Real expensive.
But he' s got no class.
That goddamned drunkard.
I' d cut off his cock.
They ought to offer rewards for his kind.
Then I' d volunteer.
Our Lord, heavenly Father.
We confess that we are unfortunately but poor, miserable sinners, and that we have no good in us.
For our hearts, flesh and blood have been so corrupted that we can never free ourselves of that evil desire.
Hence, dear Father, we ask you to forgive us our sins.
Jocke, you' re late for class.
It' s a live show?
Did I miss much?
No, he' s just getting fired up.
Yes, that was Palm Sunday in the Swedish hymn book.
Does anyone know a hymn by heart?
If you won' t give us a proper class, I' il tell the headmaster.
Shut up, you nerd.
Let' s just take it easy now.
Banana Jan, can' t you strip for us like you did at the school party?
Oh, okay.
"Then I opened my eyes, and there he stood."
"Long blond hair and pretty eyes.
Has my prince finally arrived? "
Hey, sis.
What the hell are you doing?
"I opened my eyes and gazed into his, and I was lost in the wonderful land of love."
What the hell is this?
"He took my little hand and said:
'Hi there, my name is Jocke. "'
Never mind.
He' s in your school.
So it' s that bastard?
I' il kick his nasty, little rat dick up his fucking conk.
He' d kick your arse.
What are you talking about?
You' re sick.
Is Magne in?
Why?
Remember what I told you about that brat.
Saucy sister.
What?
I didn' t mean to...
You didn' t mean to what?
Go ahead and fuck her.
Better you than that bastard Jocke.
Are these friends of yours?
What' s going on?
Your daughter is becoming a harlot.
What in God' s name are you doing?
What in God' s name are you doing?
Didn' t you see the red light?
Are you the deputy headmaster?
I' m the father of Gusten Eriksson.
I simply demand that Joakim Vanås and Ray Lopez will be expelled.
I want them out of my son' s class.
At this school we have a certain moral standard.
Listen: burglary and vandalism.
Three instances of assault.
Another burglary.
Multiple larcenies.
Threats against an official.
This is confidential information from the social authorities.
Where did you get it?
Never mind that.
But I have quite a few contacts.
This other kid doesn' t even have a guardian.
He has the authorities.
I find it reprehensible that such a bunch of layabouts are allowed to mingle with conscientious youngsters.
What about your own son?
He smokes pot.
Well, I' il be damned.
Are you blaming my son now?
You force him to mix with this kind of dregs.
If I were you, I' d be very careful with documents such as these.
The Official Secrets Act is no joke.
I will shun no means to get you.
What do you mean by that?
I happen to know that you have quite a few skeletons in the cupboard that you may not want to appear on public display.
We fully agree.
I' il fetch the boys, and then we' il go see the headmaster.
What the hell are you doing, man?
Why, he' s not a man, he' s a faggot.
Shut up, you brats.
Now.
You' re in real deep shit now.
I have some pot on me.
Hand it to me.
What' s going on?
I' il leave this in my locker.
What have you got there?
Let me see.
Take it easy.
Can I see what you' ve got in your bag?
Do you live in your locker?
You want to move in, you damn Paki?
Come along now.
Jocke, honey.
What the hell are you doing here?
She' s boozed up.
That' s none of your business.
I wish I were drunk.
I can' t find my way around here.
Give your mum a hug now.
Stop it, mum.
Stop being so disgusting.
Stop it.
You stink!
I' ve summoned you to this meeting because of a police report concerning a brawl that took place on a subway station downtown.
I found it appropriate to summon the students in question along with their parents to discuss their behaviour.
What a load of crap.
They should be in reform school.
Gustav, sit down.
Look at him.
My son tells me that these delinquents force him to do...
... all sorts of devilry!
This school is way too lenient.
Yes, but the purpose of this meeting was to discuss the matter.
A damned meeting isn' t enough.
Action is what counts.
And then, by God...
Take it easy.
Shut up, you son of a bitch.
Why do you call my son that?
Pipe down, you moaner.
Go home and wear a dress.
Let' s not get carried away.
What do you know about that?
This is no school.
It' s an institution for the education of delinquents and punks.
The important thing is to listen to each other.
If we don' t, how can we solve our conflicts?
I demand action.
I' ve listened enough to you two.
In situations like this people have to listen to each other.
That' s the basic premise for solving conflicts.
Drop them.
Is it exciting?
Are they worth shagging?
Look at that.
Is anything happening?
That wasn' t much of a party.
This is damn good pot.
I bought some for the party tonight.
What party?
There' s a huge party tonight.
I' m going.
This stuff isn' t bad at all.
Where did you get it?
The coolest guy.
He' s my contact.
He told me about a clothes warehouse we can plunder.
They have no alarm system.
I' m off.
It' s too smoky in here.
Say "hi" to your mum.
What kind of clothes is it?
It' s the greatest.
It' s some sports clothes wholesaler.
He' s got Nike and Champion.
Is it somewhere in town?
There are more coming.
What' s he doing in here?
I didn' t know he fancied chicks.
Is it a homo show?
What the hell?
What a couple of jerks.
Poofters.
That' s nasty.
Hold on.
What is it?
Quiet.
You' re so gross.
Get him out.
What a stinker.
Hold on.
I need to take a piss.
Christ, you' re so gross.
Come on.
Hi there.
You fucking bastard!
God damn it.
Take it easy.
Do we just kill each other and leave?
Come on.
Nice, Andy.
Seriously, take it easy.
Are you okay?
Sure.
I' il go take a shower.
Remember when I KO' d Tyson?
Gurra enters.
The audience is expectant.
Tyson has never been this scared.
And I move forward and smack...
Your money, Swedish pig.
Give it up or I' il fuck you.
And your mum.
You got lucky.
The next time I' il cut your throat.
Hi.
Hi.
Always with your left hand!
You got that, boy?
Is that brunette coming?
Are you horny?
What brunette?
The one with the nice rack.
Where' s Andy?
At home changing his diaper.
Yes!
I' d love to smash that fuck.
No, stay away from them.
It' s good they' re here.
The Nazis are coming.
We don' t need their help.
It' s a shame Andy isn' t here.
I heard he was on his way.
"The rescue".
So, where do you live now?
Skip it, you sodding poofter.
Mike, look at that.
Get him!
Look at that.
Your prince has arrived.
She' s just waiting for you to hook up with her.
You have no sense of humour.
You think you' re Eddie Murchy?
His name is Eddie Murphy.
I know that.
I won' t see you again.
Hi.
How are you doing?
I' m fine.
It' s real good to see you.
You too.
Would you like to dance?
I haven' t got the time.
Besides, this is a shitty dance floor.
Did you see the Jacuzzi upstairs?
No.
You have to go see it.
It' s so cool.
She can wait here.
Come on.
There' s no Jacuzzi in here.
No, there isn' t.
Well, what do you know?
Just a small, dirty couch.
Come on over and sit down.
Come on.
Thank you.
For that thing in the subway?
That was nothing.
Those damned skinheads.
They got a thrashing.
You were so brave.
You were.
Things like that happen.
The main thing is that we' re unscathed.
We really were lucky.
It could have been us down there.
I wonder what happened to the guy that was hit?
Disgusting.
Yes.
We' il catch him downstairs.
You' re just lying here having it off.
You think you' il get any tonight, you sad git?
Jesus, what an attitude.
She' s always like that.
To hell with her.
Did you push Ola onto the tracks?
I can' t hear you!
Sic him!
I didn' t do it!
Louder!
I' m sorry.
That' s not what I meant.
I trust you.
You got that?
"Yet another gang killing downtown."
"The victim, Andreas Johansson, was 17 years old, and he is believed to have taken part in a gang clash Saturday night."
"His body was found on a busy street in downtown Stockholm."
"The investigation has been stopped due to a lack of resources."
What a load of crap.
What kind of dickhead comes up with this?
He wasn' t in any bloody gang.
I can' t believe it.
Jocke, the deputy headmaster has fondled Petra.
It was so disgusting.
He forced me into a broom cupboard.
Hi there.
Petra, come on and let' s sort this out.
No.
Sort what out?
What' s that supposed to mean?
I' ve waited for this a long time.
Now you' re in serious trouble.
Nice car.
The coast is clear.
It' s just cardboard.
This isn' t what he promised us.
Women' s clothes.
What the hell are you doing?
Take it easy.
Cuff them.
Take it easy!
Let' s go before the cops get here.
Let' s get out of here.
We' il do something else instead.
You haven' t got much to show.
Come and have a look.
You' re so cute.
This is the final of the 60 kilo class.
In red we have Ray Lopez and in blue Joakim Vanås.
Let go, you fuck!
Sentence will be passed in the case against Joakim Vanås, social security number 750410 0233, registered at the address Gruvvägen 32 in Tomtberga and Ray Lopez, social security number 75 10 16 379 1.
Address unknown.
The jury finds Vanås guilty of mugging according to chapter 8, paragraph 4 of the penal code.
Off you go!!
And stay out, you bastard!
Mum?
If I hear a peep out of you, I will kill your mother!!
... will hence be imprisonment for 18 months.
You look like my mother.
Stop that.
Put a lid on it, guys.
What' s up?
That' s right, bitch.
Now I' ve got you, you snitch.
What did he do?
He ratted.
No, I know this guy.
What do you mean?
Take a hike.
Leave.
Some guys have all the luck, "pal".
How long have you known him?
For a while.
But where did you meet him?
In town.
What kind of an answer is that?
You ought to find someone else.
There is no one else.
Honey.
There must be others.
Two, Pedro.
Three.
What' s this?
Komifu.
Sure.
It' il cost you a hundred.
No problem.
Hit me.
Diamonds.
What are you serving time for?
Larceny.
Assaulting an official.
Mugging.
Things like that.
How about you?
I didn' t do my national service.
Cost me four months.
No shit?
That' s what you get.
First you bail out, then you need bail.
One should have been a criminal.
What about you?
I work here.
Drug force.
I' m unravelling the drug gang from Säffle.
That sounds weird.
Welcome to TV Paparazzi!
Give us a hand!
As usual your host is the nice, nasty and naughty DJ Rob!
We have now reached what we call "the competition".
I went to the square and found myself two size.
"Size" can refer to girls or the size of your shoes.
I don' t really know why I said that.
Ladies and gentlemen:
Helen and Marcella!
Two size who...
That' s Helen.
That' s my girlfriend.
Saucy chick.
I thought you were gay.
So, what do you do?
Go to school or a recreation centre?
Can I get a laugh?
Thank you.
DJ Rob is always such fun.
Helen, who is working extra at Tabu.
Yes, the audience is always alert in Paparazzi.
We have come to what we call the competition with a capital "C".
Marcella, what would you do if a guy stuck his hand up your dress?
Push it away, of course.
Can we get a "boo"?
What' s this?
Helen, if somebody with no forewarning...
If somebody kissed you on the lips, what would you do?
I' il count down:
Five, four, three, two...
Give me a hand!
Don' t turn off the bloody telly.
You fucking homo.
Hi.
What a horrible trip.
I can imagine.
I didn' t tell mum that I went here.
That' s probably for the best.
This is my girlfriend, Helen.
Jocke, have you got a fag?
No.
Buy some yourself.
Tony is my name.
Don' t you forget that.
Let' s take a seat.
How are you doing?
I' ve missed you.
Ray told me to say "hi".
He' s coming to pick you up.
What' s wrong?
Are you upset?
I saw a slut on TV.
I saw you making out.
I' m in prison, and you screw around with all kinds of celebrities.
How do you think that feels?
But it was the host.
You' re acting like a fucking whore.
It was a mistake.
It was a mistake to even come here!
You can just bugger off.
I don' t need you.
But I can explain.
You' ve messed up!
That' s not what happened at all.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Tony, I want you to meet one of my buddies.
He' s so frigging great.
Let' s go see him.
We' il go and see the lad.
Don' t forget about it.
Keep it in mind.
I won' t forget.
Have some.
That' s good.
Knock yourself out.
Do more.
Have some more.
That' s it.
Good.
I' il show you something pretty.
Anki.
Saucy girl.
I shagged her in the arse until she burst.
Then I chewed her snatch to a pulp.
Disgusting.
This is Lisa.
She' s alright.
But her cunt reeks.
She hasn' t washed it for a year.
I like this one.
What a cool Uzi.
I bought it from a gypsy who shot seagulls with it.
Talk about a cloud of feathers.
I' d like one of those.
You would, wouldn' t you?
If you stick to me, I' il get you a thousand of them.
We have great things in store.
Hell yes.
Yo, man.
Hey, Jocke.
What' s up?
Long time, no see.
I don' t look worse for wear, do I?
No.
You' ve put on a few pounds.
I got us a car.
Someone else is here to pick me up.
But I got this so that we could get into town.
Hi, Tony.
What' s up?
This is my buddy Ray.
Who took a dump on you, brownie?
Never mind.
Who' s this idiot?
He didn' t mean anything by it.
Take it easy.
We' il drive together.
That was uncalled for.
He' s a nice guy.
So am I.
Piece of shit car.
What the hell is he doing?
We' il take this instead.
Leave.
Coke.
A thousand a gramme.
I' m a good customer.
A price is a price.
Sure.
Then it' s 1, 500 a gramme.
Forget it, then.
Okay, 1, 500.
Business is thriving.
Are you going to talk to her?
To whom?
Your girlfriend is here.
That fucking whore.
It wasn' t that bad.
Not that bad?
She practically fucked him on telly.
Wåtz, that poofter.
I' il smack him if I see him.
But he' s here.
Fuck that guy.
He' s a customer.
He bought a gramme.
He' s so far out.
Have a look at this instead.
Prime shit.
It' s Peruvian.
Voila, monsieur.
Is it wild?
I' ve never done coke before.
Are you taking the piss?
You' ve never tried it, you amateur?
I was just wondering if I should do this much.
You' re taking mine as well.
Then you' il live longer.
You bloody idiot.
What the hell were you thinking?
Did it mess him up?
Sure, you keep pushing him.
I can' t work with that clown.
We grew up together.
He' s really calm.
Something big is coming up.
That deal I told you about.
I don' t want this psycho to tag along.
He' s really calm!
There she is, that fucking whore.
Relax.
What were you thinking?
Cunt.
What are you doing?
What is wrong with you?
I can see that you' re thinking.
Is it something about me?
Did you sleep with that guy?
Just tell me if you did or didn' t.
It drives me crazy thinking about it all the time.
I only want to be with you.
No one else.
Do you swear?
I swear.
And you' il never do it again?
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
I' m here to see Mike.
He' s in his office.
Guys, I' il see you inside.
Hi, Tony.
Hi there.
I hear you' re doing well.
I' m not complaining.
How are you doing?
I bought that one for you.
I' ve got a problem.
And?
You know Tamir, right?
A Pakistani who sells for me.
Yes.
He owes me 40, 000.
I want to send him a little warning.
Well, 40, 000 is peanuts, but I do owe you a favour.
We' il take care of it.
I' m about to do another deal that I thought I' d let you in on.
But we' il talk about that some other time.
Do you need anything?
Just let me know.
Okay.
Hi, boys.
Look at that girl over there.
I want her.
Hi, Mike.
Mike, that girl over there...
Is she part of the deal?
See you.
Hi.
Can I buy...
What are you doing here?
Mike says "hi".
Mike?
He' s funny.
So, what did he say?
He' s got a box for you.
A box?
At the races?
What a funny guy.
What the hell are you doing?
Come here.
You owe Mike 40, 000.
Then do it now!
Good.
Fuck that bastard up.
He owes me 4, 000.
Give it to me instead.
Why would I do that?
You have to pay interest.
Get the hell out of here.
It' s great to see you.
Where have you been?
Long time, no see.
Who the hell is he?
He smells.
I' m dealing horse, you know.
That pays off.
I need your help.
There' s this damn porn guy...
He owes me 20, 000.
I don' t suppose you could help me?
Let me see you get a huge hard on that you just ram in all the way.
Pure action.
If it gets flaccid, you' d better get it up in a hurry.
And then you go down on her until she comes.
I' m done with you.
Where do I blow my load?
Give me my money before you get hurt.
Have you come to show off with your new, cool friends?
I won' t pay you.
You messed up.
Give him the money, or I' il cut your throat.
Who are you?
You bloody freeloader.
Now you' re not so tough anymore.
Give him the money.
Give it to him, you pale git, or I' il plug you in the shitter.
Give it to him!
You fucking pimp.
No!
Mum?
It' s me.
Is that you, Helen?
Are you alone?
It' s Jocke and I.
Hi, honey.
How nice.
Why haven' t you called?
I' ve been worried sick.
How are you doing?
Fine, thank you.
Come on in.
I' m sorry that I' m so cautious, but there' s all sorts of odd persons coming through here.
I suppose they' re Magne' s friends.
They' re just so very odd.
I suppose I ought to call the police.
What a lovely vest.
Where did you get that?
From Jocke.
It must have cost a fortune.
Oh, and a necklace.
Dear me, it' s so beautiful.
I haven' t heard from you for weeks.
I' ve been so worried.
We' ve been with some of Jocke' s friends.
That sounds very nice.
You must have a good job.
He' s a consultant.
Some coffee?
Please.
You' ve managed well.
I can' t complain.
Magnus, is that you?
Yes.
What the hell are they doing here?
What happened to you?
What happened to your clothes?
Vagrant.
Shut your trap.
Mum, have you got 500 kroner that I can borrow?
No, not right now.
You already owe me some.
Lay off.
Pipe down.
Mum, please.
I' il pay you back Friday.
I can' t spare any money.
You can have this one as well.
Buy yourself some new clothes.
Hello.
My name is Karl Rosenberg.
I' d like to cash a check.
You have to sign on the back of it.
Where?
There?
Hand us the cash, bitch.
What' s going on?
What a disgusting place.
How the hell can you live here?
This is good stuff.
Have you smoked heroin before?
What do you need books for, junkie?
Wiping your arse?
Don' t touch my books!
Put it back!
Get your fucking hands off it!
Sure, what' s the matter with you?
Stop your gibberish.
I want to talk about the money.
How do you calculate it?
You take half of everything.
Nonsense.
We' re doing my jobs.
You' re just tagging along.
Then get some other helpers.
I want my third of this job, and then I' il turn my back on this.
Tony, we get even parts, don' t we?
Of course, the money is split evenly.
See?
But we' ve had some expenses.
But there' s a deal in the making.
What expenses?
I want my money now, you retard.
Hello?
Hi, this is Helen.
Hi there.
Can you do me a big favour?
It' s important.
We' il be there.
Don' t tell him anything.
Great.
Thanks.
That hit hard.
Do a shot of heroin.
That' il get you back on your feet.
Shit.
Get this shit out of the way.
Take it easy.
Just open the fucking door.
It' s just those crawl girls.
It' s called "call girls".
Who gives a fuck?
Get the girls in here.
Lay off, or we' il leave right away.
You have to pay no matter what.
"Lay off, or we' il leave."
Is that you, Gurra?
Did you ask that bookworm to come?
You look like shit.
What do you mean?
Have you started shooting up?
What are you talking about?
You look like crap.
You fucking cow.
Who asked those cunts to come here?
Damn it, Jocke...
Today...
Do you think he' il like it?
Sure, you look great.
It' s not embarrassing at all.
You don' t think so?
No.
You' re asking the wrong person.
I hope you' re right.
Is he here?
I told Ray to bring him here.
You' il do fine.
It' il be fun.
Hey.
Get off your arses.
That' s it.
Vera, vera, vera.
Crappy music.
How may I help you?
Four bottles of fizz in one hell of a hurry.
Get a move on.
And bring us some cokes as well, you tight little arse.
His horn is a bit rusty.
Go down on him and have a look.
Golly, golly, golly!
Welcome, welcome, welcome, everybody, to yet another wonderful evening at the Club Artiste.
As usual we have guest performers.
Ladies and gentlemen.
The Miss Teenage contest with twelve superhot, supersassy supercool ladies on the stage!
Let' s give them a spontaneous applause!
Come here, I' il lick you clean.
Jocke...
Jesus Christ, that' s Helen.
To hell with her.
What are you doing?
You can' t participate in a beauty contest, you whoring bitch.
Jocke!
Stop them or I' il blow your head off.
Jocke, come here, you idiot.
Cunts.
What is this?
Get out, God damn it!
I' il drive.
What the hell?
Move, damn it!
Go!
My car.
That was very childish of Jocke.
I thought he would be proud of me.
He' s just jealous.
That you can take part in something like this and associate with more mature guys.
Such as myself.
Maybe we should go out sometime.
I don' t think so.
We can' t just stand here.
Tag along, I' il buy you a drink.
I need to wash off this dye first.
I' il see you in five minutes.
Does anybody have a joint?
Keep your junkie pal in check!
Fucking psycho.
Watch the road!
Well, well, well, girls.
Now it' s time to get tipsy.
Helen, chin up.
How about a fixer upper?
Just juice.
And how about you, Hotlips?
No thanks, uncle.
Just ice water.
"Just ice water".
You' il never become models, that' s for sure.
Benke?
Four ice water and an Explorer 75 for me, Benke.
Why did you pull your gun?
It was you amateurs who fucked up.
Just drive, God damn it!
Drive, you sodding junkie.
Keep your eyes on the road!
The Gestapo are after us.
Go, damn it!
Go!
Stop yelling at him.
Are you afraid or what?
I just love this track.
Come on, let' s dance.
Drive!
Fucking junkie pig.
The cops are dogging us.
Are you scared or what?
You should keep track of your whore.
This is all her fault!
Just go!
I can hear the cops, but where the hell are they?
Drive!
Relax.
What the hell are you doing?
You can' t drive on the railway track!
You look so tired, little girl.
A swig of water will buck you up.
Now, doesn' t that feel much better?
He' s dead.
Gurra?
To hell with him.
Let' s move.
Gurra?
We have to leave.
Jocke...
Helen, pick it up, damn it.
You were too hard on him.
He was just a fucking junkie.
We grew up together.
And my cat died when I was four.
Is Helen there?
At this hour?
Helen has disappeared.
Take some rohypnols.
Helen has disappeared.
Sure, but we' re in a hurry now.
We have to go get the car and finish our deal.
We' il pick her up at Galaxy.
No, the cops are going to be there.
Come on, damn it!
Come on!
Everything is alright.
Are you scared or what?
Here they come.
How can you trust a psycho like that?
This is so wrong.
He looks so psyched out.
Let' s go out together.
Hold on.
I' ve dealt with him before.
Stay in the car.
I' d better go out there myself.
I' m just saying...
This really isn' t looking good.
Hey there.
Have you brought the coke?
No.
What do you mean "no"?
What kind of bullshit is this?
She is at our mercy so we want more money.
Instead of 200, 000 for 500 grammes we want 200, 000 for 100 grammes.
That' s not going to happen.
No coke, no deal.
You hear me?
Helen.
That' s Jockes little cunt.
Screw her.
They' il fuck us over, I swear they will.
Then there' il be hell to pay.
Very well, maybe the two of us can strike a deal here.
But it will have to stay between us.
I have to get a few things done.
I' il call you, alright?
Where the hell is the coke?
He didn' t have all of it.
We have to wait another week.
We' ve got to get our shit.
Yes, but we have to wait another week.
It' s okay.
I certainly hope so.
Everything' s okay.
Guys, come on.
I' m so tired of this shit.
You understand?
Then why don' t you quit?
What do you mean?
Are you some kind of gay or what?
Look at this crappy life we' re living.
Here we are, sitting here like two disgusting junkies.
I' m tired of this shit.
Listen to yourself.
It' s a vicious circle.
You never were a true friend anyway.
I can' t take it anymore.
I want out of this shit.
Then bugger off.
Helen?
Helen?
Helen?
But it' s you.
Why are you here?
Hold on.
Let me explain.
You have to help me.
It' s Helen.
What' s with Helen?
Where is she?
Mike has her.
I' il kill you!
No.
Mike' s the one who' s taken her.
If anything happens to Helen, I will cut off your cock.
Will you help me get her back?
I' ve also been fucked over.
I know what they' re up to.
Mike and Tony will fuck you over, too.
Mike demands a ransom for Helen.
Tony wants Helen for himself.
You know that' s true.
Do you know where she is?
They' re going to conclude their deal.
I know where they' il do it.
What the hell is this?
So, now you' re doing deals on your own?
Hold on a second.
Who' s got the power now?
This is all mine, get it?
All of this is mine!
Get it?
All of this is mine!
Who' s got the power now?
I' il shoot him.
Stay out of this.
Who' s got the power now?
You cowardly bastard.
No...
Mike!
You stay right here!
No!
No!
Helen?
Summer06
When I was born my parents felt they had won the lottery.
But they didn' t know me yet.
They weren' t as pleased later on.
Especially not Dad.
He likes me, but I think he' d rather have a more normal boy.
The kind that plays soccer instead of the piano.
Then he might not have left, and Mom wouldn' t be so lonely.
Martin!
- Mom says Dad' s taking a time out.
- It might be cold up north.
I guess he' s trying to figure out what to do about us.
I could stay home...
Or maybe Dad could come here, so you could see him too.
No...
Sometimes I wish I was someone else, someone more outspoken.
I' m Julia.
From day one l knew I had a lousy deal.
They weren' t were wild about me either, though Mom pretended to be.
A kaleidoscope!
Then she met this new guy, who had a daughter, so she didn' t need me.
But who cares, I don' t need her either.
Julia!
No way I' m going to visit that bitch!
This weekend is special for your mother... and that Peter guy.
Even though things were rough last Christmas, you can' t just give up.
And that daughter of his, what' s her name...?
My, that' s it.
- You' il practically be sisters.
- I don' t want to have a sister!
I want to have a dog!
That' s nasty...
I don' t like traveling but until Dad' s made his mind up, what can I do?
Go figure...
Mom gets herself a new family but I get passed around like some kind of parcel!
I should go get myself a whole new family too.
A whole new family...
Here, take this mobile phone.
How can parents let their kids use mobile phones and fry their brains?
It' s not like I enjoy sending my only child off to a strange man' s house.
I do it for you, so you can interact with both your parents even if one is... absent.
- Will you tape Robert Wells tonight?
- Sure.
But doesn' t your dad have a TV set too?
- It' s time to go!
- I really don' t want to do this.
- Have a good time...
- I' m not going, and that' s final.
Let go!
- Can' t you come along?
- You know I can' t.
I' il see you soon, honey.
Here we are.
You' re Martin, right?
I' il come and get you when it' s time to board the plane.
Thank you...
Why did you say thank you?
You thanked that lady.
It' s their job to take care of us.
You don' t need to thank them.
- Where are you going?
- Up north, to see my dad.
He lives close to the Norwegian border.
- What about you?
- I' m going south, to see my mom.
- Do you go there a lot?
- I' ve only been there once since...... since she... moved out.
She' s got a new boyfriend.
What about you?
My mother' s not ready for a new relationship.
I meant, how often do you visit your dad?
Every four weeks and every other holiday, only...
- You don' t want to.
- I wish Dad would come back home.
So Mom wouldn' t be sad all the time.
- Want one?
- No, I' m a vegetarian.
I don' t eat dead animals.
- Got any money?
- 160 kronor.
- And ten Norwegian kronor.
- Why do Norwegians water flag poles?
- Don' t know.
- They want the bulb on top to bloom.
- Want to go buy something?
- I' m not supposed to go anywhere.
- Do you have a best friend?
- Nah, that' s just silly.
I agree.
Check it out!
Come on in!
That' s London.
Robert Wells played there, at the Royal Albert Hall.
- Who?
- Robert Wells.
Some day I' m going to play there too.
- Maybe we' re twins.
- We don' t have the same parents.
- We' re cosmic twins.
- What' s that?
Pieces of the same whole, like broken bits of glass that fit together.
- Broken bits of glass?
- Just something I heard somewhere.
Let me try these...
Wow, what a trip...
Give them back...
Try this on.
Want to trade places?
If we trade places we get out of seeing our parents.
Martin, where did you go off to?
Your flight' s ready for take- off, we don' t wait for little kids you know.
Excuse me...
Could you help me out?
Julia, it' s time to go.
Julia?
- Welcome aboard.
- Hurry up, honey.
This isn' t the right plane, I' m going to see my dad.
I' m supposed to go to Norrland.
May we have your attention please as we demonstrate our safety procedures.
This information is also available in the folder in your seat pocket.
Emergency exits are located in the back, over the wings, and up front.
A light strip along the floor will direct you to the way out.
Please check which exit is the closest to your seat.
Come on, Martin!
How about some adventure?
- I don' t know...
- Is it true that you' re a wimp?
- Well, are you a wimp?
- No.
Then go for it!
Discover new frontiers.
Show people what you' re made of!
Good, it' s about time you showed some spunk.
Let' s hear it for Martin!
We would like to remind you that smoking is prohibited.
And we' d like to wish you a pleasant trip.
- Where could that dad of yours be?
- I don' t know.
I hope your mother told your dad when your flight would be in.
- What' s his phone number?
- I don' t know.
- You don' t know?
- I' ve forgotten it.
Is that your dad?
Well?
Martin!
I' m so sorry...
Thank you, I apologize for the delay.
- I was busy breeding.
- Bye.
Look at you...
Does Robert Wells have a new hairdresser?
Wow, muscles...
Have you been working out?
- How' s school?
- Fine.
- And your classmates?
- Everything' s fine.
- Great.
- Good.
Sverker will be surprised.
He thinks all you do is sit still and play the piano.
I can' t sit still, and I don' t play the piano either.
- Have you quit playing?
- Not really...
- But I' m trying to cut back.
- I see...
But you will play for us at the party, won' t you?
- Gran' s birthday party.
- Oh, that party...
Gran' s really looking forward to it.
As you can see, it' s still a bit cold up here.
But down south in Malmö they' re already wearing swim trunks.
Julia!
Kicki wanted me to pick you up.
I know you' re a tough cookie...... but you' il find I' m a worthy opponent.
Good, then we won' t have a repeat of the Christmas incident.
- You' ve changed.
- Yeah, my hair is nicer.
What do your friends say?
- Tell me.
- They don' t say much...
Your stepfather is a world- famous Gladiator, of course you' ve bragged about it.
Be like Pollux: big, bad and beautiful!
The Gladiators, on TV.
Don' t you watch the show?
No, Mom...
- Mom doesn' t like shows like that.
- Are you nuts?
She yells her head off cheering.
You' il see, tonight.
Listen, don' t give My a hard time.
- Get in the back.
- Hi...
My!
Hop in.
I don' t usually sit in the front seat.
Funny...
I' m so glad you' re here.
- I' ve missed you like crazy.
- You have?
Of course I have.
Pop upstairs and say hi to your gran, I' il start cooking dinner.
I' il take your jacket.
Martin... is that nail polish?
- Isn' t it neat?
- It might not go down well here...
I' il take it off if you want me to.
Long hair is one thing...
But some folks might think nail polish is strange.
All the guys wear nail polish in Stockholm.
People would think it was strange if you didn' t.
I see...
- I don' t want you to get in trouble.
- Why would l?
Martin, is that you?
Wait here in the car.
- Knock it off.
- What?
- You are so busted.
- It wasn' t my idea...
It' s not my fault your parents got divorced.
- I know that.
- You do?
You told me you' d still have a mom if it wasn' t for me.
Did I say that?
And you said you' d cut my hair off when I was asleep.
Oh... that was a rotten thing to say.
You should have seen the way the shop girls stared at me.
Their eyes were like this.
- Excuse me!
- I knew it.
Right, do you have a pen?
I can' t sign autographs without a pen.
- You forgot your change.
- Oh...
Thanks.
People are always asking Dad for his autograph.
And he came to my school and showed everyone his muscles.
- Why?
- Everyone wanted to see them.
Hi...
- You' ve changed.
- Thanks.
Come on in.
- What do you think?
- Pretty.
But the shoes are a pain, I can barely walk in them.
They set off your legs, Kicki.
And no one' s got legs like yours!
Go and unpack, you can try on your dresses later.
Stay out of my room!
Sorry, I' il go to my room...
I need to freshen up.
Flying leaves you all grimy.
Those pigs are the cutest!
I wish I could have one as a pet.
- What' s that?
- A cream sauce.
It' s very rich, so don' t tell your mom I' m feeding you stuff like that.
Does anyone come around to see her?
In the evenings...
Guys that come to date...
She' s not ready for a new relationship.
I' m sorry, I shouldn' t have asked you that.
But that' s just what she says.
Some people meet someone when they walk into a 7- Eleven store.
- Has your mom...?
- No, not her.
Other people.
Oh...
Could you tell Gran that dinner' s ready?
Gran...
- Dinner' s ready.
- Who are you?
- Where' s Martin?
- Are you coming?
Who is this little girl, Torkel?
Mother....
It' s Martin.
- That is not Martin.
- Stop it, Mother.
Dinner' s ready, come down when you' re ready.
I don' t eat meat.
- Since when?
Thursday.
- I told you it' s not Martin.
- Stop it, Mother.
May I come in?
Have you seen... the room?
We weren' t sure...
After what happened at Christmas we weren' t sure you' d be here much, and Peter needed some space.
So we packed away your things.
But they' re in the boxes.
We really want to see you, and you do have a room at your dad' s place.
Is his computer still in there?
You should tell him to throw it out.
Your room isn' t a junkyard, you tell him I said that.
Take your time and unpack your things.
You can try your dress on later.
Right...
I' m just going to work out a little.
Your mother is lucky in love, that' s for sure.
Let' s speed things up...
No... that was a little too fast.
Set it for ten.
Aren' t they gorgeous?
- This one' s yours, Julia.
This is what we' il look like.
- I don' t usually wear dresses.
- I know...
That' s why I was so happy that you agreed to wear one on this special and wonderful day.
What' s this?
Strange...
You seem to have gotten smaller.
- Doesn' t your dad feed you?
- Sure, he serves lots of pork.
- You don' t eat meat.
- That' s right, I forgot that she...... that I' m a vegrarian.
- Maybe I should wear something else?
- No, I can fix it.
I really appreciate that you' ve started combing your hair again.
- Here they come, Martin.
- Who?
- Hello, Torkel.
- Good to see you.
- How was the trip?
- A bloody nightmare!
- Where' s Ma?
- I' m worried about her.
- She didn' t recognize Martin.
- She didn' t?
- Hi there, you poor little thing.
- Mother' s resting.
Well if it isn' t Martin, the piano mistress.
Are they still mean to you at school?
I' ve got even more super- powers.
I can move myself with my mind.
It' s true, I' il show you later.
Joakim could teach those Stockholmers a thing or two.
He never says no to a fight.
Hello, Joakim.
Show Uncle Torkel how good you are.
Up with the left...
Come on, show him.
- Not bad.
- He' s good.
What are you doing with that?
- Are you going to sleep in here?
- Got something against it?
It sounds like fun.
You like Norwegian jokes?
You know, the kind that poke fun at Norwegians.
I know loads.
- That' s news to me.
- Want to hear one?
Know why Jesus wasn' t born in Norway?
They couldn' t find three wise men.
- Want to hear another one?
- Know any dirty jokes?
Do you know the difference between a mailbox and a horse' s ass?
Then we can' t send you to mail letters.
- You' ve grown up.
- You think so?
You used to be like a girl.
Excuse me, is it all right if I turn on the TV?
Go ahead.
Oh my God, it' s eight!
- Peter!
- My!
Are you coming?
Welcome to the Gladiators!
Featuring Pollux!
What a cool dude!
Pollux - he' s big, bad and beautiful!
He really cleaned up last week...
What am I doing here?
I don' t want to be here.
Why don' t you do something about it?
Aren' t you on TV?
- Take charge of your life, Martin.
- It' s not easy.
Sometimes you have to do hard stuff.
Follow your heart, Martin.
I don' t know what that means, or what to listen for.
Well, you can hear me.
Are you the voice of my heart?
Now you see me, but before you know it, I will be transported...
-... without moving a muscle.
- Fat chance!
- Are you still here?
- How are you, Ma?
Hello.
- Hello...
- Martin... - It' s Martin!
I have this friend in Malmö called Martin.
Are you out of your mind?
You can' t call me here.
I' ve decided to follow my heart and tell the truth.
What?
Speak up, closer to the phone.
These people are nuts and they' re making me wear a dress.
- Say no, I would.
- Then come here and say it.
- I' m not staying.
- We agreed to trade places.
- I didn' t agree.
- You said you didn' t want to go.
I said I wanted my dad to come home.
I might be able to help you.
Torkel' s been asking if your mother is seeing someone.
That means he' s jealous.
He might be thinking about coming home.
Let' s wait until tomorrow and I' il find out what he' s up to.
I don' t want to spend the night here!
How are you ever going to reach London if you can' t even go to Malmö?
- By the way, your cousin' s cute.
- Jonathan?
Oh no, not Joakim...
If he tries to take Grandpa' s moped again, you' ve got to stop him.
Okay, it' s your turn.
- I didn' t know you could drive.
- You don' t know me very well.
Want to go into town and check out the chicks?
Don' t you know what chicks are?
Or would you rather practice piano?
Then hop on.
Hold on.
Maybe there aren' t any chicks around here.
Look!
Now don' t make a fool of yourself.
- Hi there.
- Don' t you recognize us?
- Unfortunately, we do.
- Is it all right if I pet your dog?
- Go ahead.
- What' s his name?
- Rhonda, she' s a girl.
- It' s hard to tell the difference.
- I know.
What' s up?
Want to have a ride?
On that?
- Is it fun to have a dog?
- Not if you have to walk it a lot.
- We could come along.
- Or we could walk Rhonda.
- Wait!
- What a cutie!
Well, I think you' re cute.
Really cute.
- Are you going to bed?
- Yeah.
- Me too.
- Oh...
You' re so different.
Compared to what you were like last Christmas.
- I never thought you' d wear a dress.
- Neither did I.
- You looked nice in it.
- Really?
- It was a little big, though.
- Yeah...
You know what?
As of tomorrow, we' il be family.
Is that good or bad?
I just wanted to say goodnight.
The kaleidoscope...
I thought you threw it away?
- Why did you say you threw it away?
- I don' t know.
Funny how broken bits of glass can be so pretty...
And if two pieces of glass fit together...
- Then maybe they' re...
-... cosmic twins!
You still remember that nonsense, do you?
It' s not nonsense, it' s true!
Julia...
My Julia.
I love you so much.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Listen... about the dress...
I know you don' t really like dresses.
It' s actually kind of pretty.
Will you wear it?
29...
And one for Ma...... and one for Pa.
Good morning.
Two more, and that' s it.
It' s awful, but I haven' t been able to sleep.
I' m so darned nervous.
But a tough cookie like you wouldn' t understand that.
- I would too...
- I know I shouldn' t worry.
But I have this funny feeling something will go wrong.
Gran says that a troubled soul is a living soul.
Right...
Want to try some?
It' s an energy drink.
Sometimes you need a boost...
- Want to give it a go?
- No...
Come on, girlie.
Give it a whirl.
You sit there and put your feet up there.
Whoops, that was too much...
I' il lose a couple more.
Good.
Good job, one more...
Come on!
- Come meet...
- Rosa... -... and Linda.
We work together at Salon Rosalinda!
On Monday they leave for the Barrier Reef, their honeymoon.
That' s in Australia, you know.
- Won' t that be fun?
- They' re not taking me.
Don' t you know what grown- ups do on a honeymoon?
They mess around!
- No peeking!
- I need to take a leak.
Go outside, this place is a ladies' room only today.
But it' s my regular week to be with Mom anyway.
Actually, this week was Mom' s week, only they switched.
It makes you wonder if they would do the same for us, move around, I mean.
I think my mother would like to have me all the time.
Now it' s your turn, girls.
Exciting, isn' t it?
That your mom is getting married?
I don' t think so, I think she misses dad too much.
Oh...
Has she told you that?
No, Mom always says everything' s fine even when it isn' t.
Let' s see what we can do...
Oh, not...
Martin' s wearing girlie underwear!
- Check it out!
- Yuck!
I knew there was something wrong with him!
- Dad!
Could I do my vanishing trick at the party?
What a nut you are.
- Something' s wrong with Martin.
- To say the least...
If my son wore floral panties, I' d send him to military school.
He' d have no say in the matter, and how fair would that be?
Well if it isn' t the piano mistress.
- I' m not a mistress...
- That' s not what I hear.
I hear you' re pretty girlie- girlie.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let' s go fix dinner, Martin.
- Does it hurt?
- Of course not...
I dislike violence, but it was about time someone taught him a lesson.
- Why haven' t you done it?
- He' s always been like that.
Listen, there' s something I' ve got to tell you.
You see, I' m going to move out at the end of the month.
- Was that why you asked about Mom?
- I want her to be okay with this.
- I' m sure she' il be glad.
- I want you to be glad too.
See...
I' ve met someone I like.
Dinner, coming up!
Her name is Eva- Karin...
Martin!
- I should have told you...
- It' s disgusting!
All you think of is your own pleasure even if means death!
Does it seem that bad to you?
- I never wanted to hurt anyone...
- What do you use for brains?!
I want you to be okay with this, that' s the most important thing.
I' il never do something like this again without talking to you first.
- Promise?
- I promise.
What about the dinner?
It' s too late to make any changes at this point, but if you give me the chance
I' il tell Eva- Karin how you feel.
Eva- Karin?
- What about the pigs?
- The pigs?
What are you doing here in the dark?
The guests are arriving.
Don' t be afraid, he' s promised to talk to me beforehand.
And I' il never, ever let you die!
- Welcome!
- Please have a drink.
Everyone at Twilight Cottage wishes you a happy birthday!
- For me?
- Evert and Anna- Märta chipped in.
- But not Åke and Mrs. lsaksson.
- You can have two sets of china.
- Is my hearing aid ringing?
- This is Martin and Eva- Karin.
All the grandchildren are here.
It would have been nice if Martin were here.
- He promised to play for us.
- Martin will play for you.
- I can assure you he will.
- Let' s go inside.
Is it hard to walk with those sticks?
Yes, it' s very difficult.
I can carry them for you, I' m really strong!
We will be hearing...
What?
I think I' il improvise.
The boy' s improved.
- Don' t waste our time...
- He might not feel like playing.
- Considering...
- Right?
We love music.
- I wish I could play.
- So, go ahead.
Do this.
And you do this.
Any more music lovers?
- How is everything?
- Your dad is moving back in.
- Really?
- At the end of the month.
- Thanks for helping me out.
- You' re helping me.
Go, you' re free!
What are you, stupid?
You can' t trust a guy like that!
Save yourselves, run!
All right...
If you' d rather be Christmas dinner, suit yourselves!
I certainly do...
I do...
I do.
I do.
Oh, Kicki!
I don' t have the words...
Your waist is like a wasp.
Your hair is like a wedding cake.
And those legs...... are divine!
- You look good too.
- So do you.
Could you pull over?
I need to pee.
- Why didn' t you go before we left?
- Well she didn' t, so stop the car.
I don' t get it, she spent all day in the ladies' room, and all...
- I' ve got to go too.
- Again?
See...
Wait, Julia...... or whatever your name is, wait!
- Where is Julia?
- In Renvattnet.
Up north, by the Norwegian border.
- Everything fine?
- Yeah.
Need to make a call?
You can borrow my phone.
But only if you look after Rhonda for a while.
The bride' s a knock- out.
Welcome to the church.
- I' m Peter.
- Aren' t you...?
You' re Pollux, right?
I always root for you.
- Thank you.
- Come along, kids.
- How are you doing?
- I' m fine.
You know...
A troubled soul is a living soul.
I guess we won' t be related after all.
- Is that good or bad?
- What do you think?
Let' s go upstairs to the gallery.
Hello!
Come here.
- Look at all those people.
- I don' t see well at a distance.
- I usually wear glasses.
- I' il help you out.
Here come our neighbors.
Dad says they' re filthy rich.
And those guys work with dad.
Rosa and Linda are over there.
- Hello!
Forget everything I told you, he' s just like the rest.
- What do you mean?
- He' s met someone!
- But what about Mom?
- All he cares about is himself.
Just like my mom, who doesn' t care about me or anyone else.
That' s not true, Kicki loves you.
- When did she say that?
- Yesterday.
- She said it to you.
- Yes...
- Then it' s you she loves.
- She thought I was you.
But it wasn' t me.
This just isn' t working out!
I' ve looked all over for you.
- How long were you on the phone?
- I' il pay for it.
That' s all right, he took care of Rhonda for me.
- Bye, Martin!
- You can watch Rhonda anytime.
What did she say?
She told me... that things weren' t the way I thought they were.
- Dad' s met someone.
- So?
You didn' t expect him to move back in with your mom, did you?
- Are you going to tell Kicki?
- I have to.
It' s your call, just listen to your heart.
Robert...?
Robert Wells.
How could you be so careless?
- You know it' s a rare antique.
- I thought it was a moped.
Rare means valuable and special...
Just like you.
I wish you would tell me what' s wrong.
Then maybe we could start trusting each other again.
Where' s my old Martin?
- Doesn' t that look scrumptious!
- No, I think it looks tasty.
I' m not Martin.
I already know that.
I' m Julia.
It' s time.
You look great.
Are you ready, My?
Go get Julia.
Hurry up.
Give me a kiss.
Come on.
Come on, Julia.
Hurry up.
We make our entrance when the bells stop ringing.
- What' s the matter?
- I have to talk to you, Kicki.
- It' s not a good time.
- Right now.
Let go of me...
- What is it, Julia?
- I' m not Julia.
That' s not funny!
She' s got cold feet, she' s going back to her ex.
- I can sense it.
- No, Kicki would never do that.
I know it' s hard to understand...
But it' s like those pieces of glass in a kaleidoscope, two identical pieces lock into place.
That' s impossible.
That' s what happened.
But...
Why?
She traded me and my dad for a new guy and a new kid.
A kid with pretty hair.
Your hair is pretty too, but it wouldn' t hurt to comb it.
May l?
Mom said she wanted to live on her own.
But then she met this new guy right away at a 7- Eleven store.
He has a daughter, so she doesn' t need me anymore.
And now they' re getting married.
I told you so.
In the presence of God and this congregation, we have gathered here to join this couple in holy matrimony:
Peter "Pollux" Bergvall...... and Kristina Linnea Lindström.
We are gathered here to bless this union...
I' m sorry...
I can' t go through with this.
Not without Julia.
Well?
- What are you doing?
- What' s your dad' s number?
- What' s going on?
- Peter, please.
Does this have anything to do with Anders?
What' s this, peas?
Don' t you want to be big and strong?
Peas are good for you.
Is pig- farming profitable?
- How are you doing?
- I' m worried about Martin.
- If he was my son, I' d send...
- That' s it, I' ve had enough!
I' m sick and tired of being bullied by you all my life!
I' il have you know that I' m proud of Martin just the way he is!
I was going to say I' d send him to a music academy.
- Could you put Julia on?
- Who is this?
- Put Julia on!
- What are you talking about?
- Let my daughter go!
- I don' t have your daughter.
Dad, it' s me, Martin.
- I' m sorry.
- But...
- It' s all my fault.
- No, it isn' t, Martin.
And it' s not Julia' s fault either.
It' s all my fault.
But I' ve realized one thing...
You can' t run away from who you are.
You taught me that, Martin.
We might as well get used to it.
Goodbye.
It was fun, wasn' t it, Ma?
- Goodbye, Bodil.
- Take care.
I was wondering...
Would you like to be my girlfriend?
You wouldn' t even talk to me a few hours ago.
- Now you' re a girl.
- I' m still the same person.
- Bye, Joakim.
- Look at me!
Where did you come from?
Bye, Jonathan.
I' ve booked the first flight out to Stockholm tomorrow, and so have they.
- Do you think she' il want to see me?
- I can assure you she will.
How about it, toots?
Want to go fishing?
- You' re not like other guys.
- That' s what they tell me.
You' re so brave.
I' m not exactly a gladiator.
No, but you speak your mind.
You' re brave for real.
How did it go, Martin?
Did you have an adventure?
Good.
Here...
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Martin.
- I' m so happy...
- Me too.
- Boy, you' ve changed!
- Don' t say that.
No, you haven' t changed a bit.
- So you' re a newlywed, I guess.
- No...
I couldn' t go through with it.
Not without Julia.
- So it' s up to me?
- Yeah...
If I do it, what' s in it for me?
You can...
You can have a...
A dog?
Don' t worry, Dad, I don' t need a dog, but then again...
- Come, let' s play together.
- You' re doing fine without me.
Please, just for the heck of it?
- So, you' re going to Renvattnet.
- And then to Malmö.
I' il be back.
Thanks.
- Where are you going?
- To London.
- London?
- Only we' d rather stay home.
I' ve been searching for a long time

Oh, that, s cool, man.

That' s why they call me "Air Elliot."
- [Imitating Crowd Cheering]
Well, you know, make sure that you let me know the right time,, cause last week you said 6: 30, and when I got there you guys were just leaving.
- How stupid did you feel?
- Pretty stupid, Elliot.
Not a problem, Danny.
Give it up.
- [Man]
Hey, Daniel.
- Hey, man, how you doing?
Hey, Bob.

- Hey, Elliot.
So, uh, you and your posse gonna hit the brewery tonight?
My posse?

It' s a headset injury.
What do you say you and me go knock back suds and check out the babes?
Elliot, I' m married, remember?
- Ohhh.
[Imitates Whip Snapping]
That just gets funnier every time you do that.
- Don' t- Don' t- Don' t -- - [Elliot]
Hey, Jerry!
Jerry, Jerry, bo- berry Fee, fie, fo- ferry, Jerry
- What, s happening, brother?
- Uh, running to an important meeting.
Oh, yeah?

- It' s Elliot.
Who told hi m we were here?
- Oh!
Hi.
You guys.
Well, well, well, isn' t this a big surprise?
I thought everybody was busy.
- Uh, slight change of plans, Elliot.
- Oh, is that right?
Well, I' m a little bit peeved at you guys.
I' m thinking you tried to ditch me.
- We can understand that.
See you tomorrow.
- Later, Elliot.
I' m kidding.
- Wanna switch places with me?
- No, I' m fine.
Oh, my goodness gracious.
[Dan Chuckling]
You' ve got to be kidding me.
Please, please don' t tell me you have a thing for Alison Gardner.
Please.
[Jerry]
You' re way out of your league.
[Carol]
Brian, with the teeth -- Brad, Brian -- the guy with the teeth.
- Oh, yeah?
How do you know?
- I know a lot of things about her.
I know -- I know that she likes her bagels buttered, but not toasted.
- Wow.
- How specific.
Mm- mm- mm.
- Sounds like you guys are old friends.
Well, we have been working at the same company for four years now.
You spend that much time together, you get to know each other.
So it should be really no problem for you to just get up, walk over and say hello to her.
- She, s with somebody.
Oh!
Come on, Elliot.
Come clean here.
- You have never spoken to Alison Gardner, right?
- Of course I have.
- Did I say "queer" earlier?
I guess you guys are just not gonna let me relax until I go over there and say hello.
- [All Murmuring Agreement]
That' il make you happy?
- Don' t touch me.
- [Carol]
Goodluck.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Do I know you?
Uh, we, ve only been working together at Synedyne for the last four years.
I' m Elliot Richards.
We- We' ve spoken.
I - I don' t --
It was the first week of June three years ago.
I said it was "wet out."
We were standing in the lobby and I said it was "really wet out."
- It was raining at the time.
- I assumed that.
Yeah.
So, here we are talking again.
Yeah.
Uh, well, take it easy.
You know, I' m here with some friends and I was wondering if maybe you wanted to --
Dear God, I would give anything to have that girl in my life.
[Tone Loc' s "Wild Thing"]
- Hi.
- Hello.
Uh, I was wondering if, uh, this is --
Uh, I was standing over there and the --
You' re very glib.
I bet you' re a whiz with the ladies.
- Well -- - You here alone?
No, uh, I' m here with some buddies from work --
- I saw you talking to a woman.
- Um --
I' m not with her.
But you' d like to be, huh?
- What makes you say that?
When a man says he' d give anything to have a certain woman in his life,
I just assume she means something to him.
How did you hear me say that?
I was standing all the way over --
I have fantastic hearing, and a number of other equally impressive talents.
Ho- doggie!
Let' s go some place quiet so we can talk.
Um, okay.
You -- What?
You wanna talk to me?
Is that a problem?
You' re not attracted to me?
Uh, no.
I think you' re hot.
Baby, you have no idea.
- Kiss me.
- What?
Don' t be afraid to explore new horizons.
Can you give us two seconds, girls?
Yeah, can you give us two seconds?
Sure.
Whatever.
But my friends are, uh, probably waiting for me, so, I' m -- I' m gonna just get going.
You, re so nervous, Elliot.
How do you know my name?
I' m psychic.
Duh.
Now, then, Ijust wanna talk business for a second.
Oh, um, I' m not into that.
I mean, I -- I' ve never paid for sex before.
It was an Internet thing.
Every time you sign on, it' s sex, sex, sex.
I' m not a hooker, you silly boy.
I just wanna ask you a question.
How would you like to make one simple decision... that' il change your life forever?
Okay, I' m glad Scientology works for you, but --
Just listen.
What if I told you that I had the cataclysmic power... to give you anything and everything you' ve always dreamed of?
- Who are you?
- Promise not to tell anyone?
Cross your heart and hope to die?
I' m the Devil.
Okay.
I think somebody' s had "tee many martoonis."
I am the Devil, Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub, the Prince of Darkness.
Well, the Princess of Darkness, anyway.
Oh.
"The Devil." Yep.
That explains it.
Now I believe you.
- [Screams]
- You' re a very skeptical person, you know that?
How did you -- How did you just -- And you --
- What' s -- - Look.
I fyou could just buy into this whole "I' m the Devil" thing, it' il save us both a lot of these questions.
Although it' s gonna be hard to find one that' il go to Hell this time of night.
Ooh, what a delightfully piquant wit.
I can see we' re gonna get along famously.
Cheers, darling.
You can' t do that.
That' s very dangerous.
Why is this so hard for you to believe?
Do you think your mommy and daddy just made me up so you' d be a good boy?
Okay, okay, you' re the Devil.
What do you want with me?
I want you to be happy, Elliot.
You have such potential.
All you need is a little push in the right direction.
- Oh, please.
You don' t have to lie to me.
I know every dark thought in your tiny little mind.
I know that every night you go home to your horrible little apartment... and you eat your little frozen dinner and you make your little bowl of popcorn... and you watch TV and you can' t keep your eyes open anymore.
And then you crawl off to bed... and wonder why you' re alone and nobody likes you.
- Not every night.
- And you cry.
Yeah, sure.
I know what' s in your heart, Elliot.
You could cry right now.
Taking control of your destiny.
You wanna be liked?
You wanna be loved?
How about respected?
How about feared?
What exactly are we talking about?
You wanna see how it works, baby?
Wish for something.
- Like what?
- Whatever you want.
It' s yours.
Just say the word.
It is done.
["Wild Thing"]
What can I get you?
- A Big Mac and a large Coke.
- Fries?
- No.
- Comes to $3. 47.
Do you have $3. 47?
I left my purse in the underworld.
This truly is the work of the Devil.
And to think that I doubted you.
I' m gonna go now.
- What' s the problem?
- This doesn' t prove anything!
I could have done this myself.
I even had to pay for it.
There' s no such thing as a free lunch.
Didn' t anyone ever tell you that?
- I didn' t even get any fries!
- Oh, I don' t believe this.
Okay.
Come.
[Horn Honking]
[Truck Horn Honking]
[Woman]
[People Shouting, Clamoring]
Elliot, right here.
Right here, Elliot.
Where are we?
- Everyone who?
- All your friends.
[Techno Dance]
- No way.
This is your club?
Wow!
[All Shouting]
Elliot!
- Elliot, dance with me first.
- No, Elliot, dance with me.
- [Devil]
That' s enough.
Hey, Elliot, how the hell are you?
Somebody take a picture of me and Elliot.
- Excel lent.
- Hi, Elliot.
- [Devil]
- You hungry?
- Sort of.
- Wow.
- I aim to please, handsome.
- Come on.
- You liked that, didn' t you?
- What, the cookie?
Having all those people excited to see you.
It' s nice to feel accepted, isn' t it?
I can give you that.
I can make the whole world love you.
- You still don' t believe me.
- Of course not.
First of all, you look nothing like the Devil.
Oh, really?
I suppose I could have gone this way.
- But it' s so "trick or treat."
It' s true.
You really are the Devil.
Come on, baby.
Come and sit down.
I know this has all been horribly overwhelming for you.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure you can.
You can ask me anything you like, as long as you don' t ask me if there' s a God.
I get that one all the time.
Yes, there' s a God.
Really?
Well, what' s He like?
You know, you' d think that meeting the Devil would be interesting enough, but no, all people want to know about is Him.
- So, He' s a man?
- Yeah.
Most men think they' re God.
This one just happens to be right.
Now listen, darling.
This is pretty -- Um --
"I, Elliot Richards, hereafter known as the Damned --"
- "The Damned"?
- How about "the Darned"?
Sound better?
Don' t get hung up on the language, darling.
There' s nothing sinister here.
It' s all standard boilerplate.
Paragraph one states that I, the Devil, a not- for- profit cooperation... with offices in Purgatory, Hell and Los Angeles, will give you seven wishes... to use as you see fit.
Seven?
Why not eight?
I don' t know.
[Mumbling]
Are you kidding?
I have to give you my soul?
- After you' ve had your wishes, of course.
- But it' s my soul!
- I can' t give you my soul!
- What are you, James Brown?
What' s the big deal?
- Do you even know what it is?
- Of course.
It' s the thing that -- that --
No, that' s the -- It floats around --
Can I tell you something?
Souls are overrated.
They don' t really do anything.
No.
It' s like your appendix.
You' il never even miss it.
Yeah, well, if it' s so useless, then how come you want it so much?
Ooh, aren' t you the clever one?
Look, who' s really making out on this deal here?
Seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul?
Well, I don' t know.
What have we here?
But who is that?
Alison?
How did you --
She is so beautiful.
- I' ve been waiting for you for so long.
- Who' s that?
- Who' s she with?
- I want you now, my love.
- Why are you showing me this?
- I' m yours forever, my darling.
- [Gasps]
- Oh, I love your hair like that.
- Is this real?
All you have to do is sign.
- And you promise I' il get her?
- It' s really up to you.
You' re the one with the wishes.
Sign it, Elliot.
Please, Elliot.
I' m waiting.
[Echoing]
[Wind Howling]
- Great!
If for any reason your wish isn' t going the way you hoped, just take out the pager, hit 666... and it' il bring you right back to me.
Why wouldn' t it go the way that I' d hoped?
Oh, I was just throwing that out as a "for instance."
Every wish is gonna be 100% fabulous.
But you' il find that out as soon as you make one.
So, I should make one now?
Well, if you don' t mind.
I' ve got places to go, people to condemn to an eternity of fiery torment.
Okay.
Um, let me think.
- I wanna be married to Alison.
- You got it.
Um, that' s not all.
I wanna be rich.
- Always a popular choice.
- That' s not all.
I wanna be very rich and very powerful.
Oh, even better.
Remember, you have to say "I wish."
Right.
I wish that I were married to Alison... and that I were very, very rich and very powerful.
- How, s that sound?
- Sounds good to me.
Enjoy.

- [Groaning]
- Back so soon?
[Groaning]
You turned me i nto a drug dealer.
They almost killed me.
- You asked for rich and powerful.
- Not like that.
Goes with the territory, babe.
Root of all evil.
Ring any bells?
- What about Alison?
What got into her?
- I think it was Raoul.
Yeah!
That' s not what I wished for.
Well, hold on now, mister.
You wished that the two of you were married.
You didn' t say anything about her loving you.
Well, you know, when two people get married, I assume that --
There' s your mistake.
May I suggest something?
- What?
- The rich and powerful thing wasn' t really the way to go.
Everyone wishes for that first thing out of the gate and it never pans out.
- Really?
- The fact of the matter is... women aren' t really attracted to wealth and power.
- They' re not?
- No, of course not.
They couldn' t give a fig for all that rubbish.
What you need to figure out is what she does want in a man.
Easy.
[Horns Honking]
I' m not with her!
- Where are we?
- [Meows]
- We can' t be in here.
This is breaking and entering.
I know.
It' s fun, isn' t it?
I' m sure we' re gonna find the answer somewhere around here.
- What if Alison catches us?
- Don' t worry.
She won' t be able to see you.
- Besides, she' s in the shower... naked.
- [Shower Running]
Right behind that door.
Take a peep.
- No!
- Oh, come on.
We both know you want to.
You must think that I' m really perverted, don' t you?
That' s what you think.
- Yes.
- Well, in that case, maybe I' il just take a quick look.
Focus, Elliot.
Remember, we' re here to find out what kind of man she wants.
- How are we gonna do that?
- Well, she keeps a journal.
And here it is.
I should be able to find some information in here you' il find useful.
- Hey, that' s private stuff.
- Is it ever.
Listen to this. "Last night was the most incredible night of my life." I never did find out any of the guys' names, but I brought them back here...
"and all five of them banged me like a Salvation Army drum."
- Just kidding.
I could have been a writer.
[Gasps]
She could bump into you and she wouldn' t feel it.
Now, this is good.
[Alison' s Voice]
"I meet many attractive men who are interested in me,
"and while many of them are handsome or clever or very successful,
"I findmyself turning away from them...
"and searching the horizon for someone else." I don' t know who he is or where I' il find him. "I only know that he is a sensitive man." He' s a man who is in touch with his emotions. "He' s a man who' s not afraid to share his fears,
"his disappointments and his tears.
Where are you, my sensitive man? "[Gasps]
[Gasps]
Did you see that?
She passed right through me.
We were one person for a split second, just like in Ghost.
Darling, I' ve got an earthquake in Chile in eight minutes.
Any chance of making a wish here?
Yes.
I were the most sensitive man in the world.
Right.
Okay.
Wait!
Damn.
I was hoping you wouldn' t catch that.
I could have had a lot of fun with that one.
- And I want her to love me.
You know what?
- You do?
- Hey.
- Where did you run off to?
- I went to make a garland of beach plums... to place atop your glorious head like a crown.
But then I caught sight of that sunset and...
I don' t know, something stirred inside me... and I had to stop and weep.
Mmm, it' s beautiful.
It is.
- There I go again.
- Tissue?
No, I never wipe my tears away.
I' m not ashamed of them.
I wear them proudly,
like small, wet, salty badges of emotional truth.
Elliot, um, there' s something that I think that we should talk about.
Um, we' ve been together for what, about three weeks now?
- Three magical weeks.
- Three magical weeks.
And I don' t think that I' ve ever met a man who' s been more in touch...
- I love you... so very much.
- [Barking]
- Dudley!
Peter!
I' m sorry.
They' re such little devils.
Come on, you naughty boys.
I' m sorry.
Are you okay?
Um, do you need comforting on any level?
No, no, no, I' m fine.
Have I done or said anything to make you feel less good about you?
- No, no, no, I' m fine.
- Would you like something to eat?
Oh, wow.
- What is it?
- It' s that sunset again.
And I worry about the dolphins.
Would you like to hear it?
Now?
I - I -- [Sighs]
Dolphin, dolphin I adore
Everything you are
- I have to stop.
I mean, oh, why?
Because I' m looking at you and I' m seeing all the beauty... of the world shining at me through your eyes.
- Would you mind if I sketched you?
- I didn' t know you could draw.
I' m not an artist, perse.
Okay, Elliot, there' s something that I think I really have to say.
Elliot, that' s amazing!
Compared to you, it' s nothing.
Compared to your smile... and the blush of your cheek and the sound of your voice as it floats on the evening breeze.
Compared to you, that sunset' s just --
- Maybe we should go.
- No, wait.
There' s so much that I wanna say to you, but I just can' t find the words.
I have an idea.
I would like... to improvise a sonnet about your hair.
Excuse me, fellas.
Might I ask you to... take the horseplay down to another part of the beach?
Uh, no.
You know, rather than get confrontational, why don' t we all just sit down together, have some salad with dolphin- safe tuna and see if we can' t start a dialogue.
You know, I had a feeling that you were gonna --
Okay, guys, I' m afraid I' m going to have to ask you... to respect the moment that my woman friend and I are sharing... because it' s a special celebration of love and caring... and a unique spiritual and emotional understanding.
- You wanna get a beer?
- Sure.
Alison, excuse me, but I thought that this was our time together.
It' s just a beer.
I' il be back in two seconds.
Actually, my place is like 40 minutes from here.
- That' s fine.
Which way is your car?
- It' s a van.
- Great.
- Alison, I respect your uniqueness and individuality.
And you' re your own person, and if you want to go with our new friends here... to get a drink, I won' t stand in your way.
I knew you' d understand.
- No, wait!
Don' t go!
Why don' t you wanna stay here with me?
You wanna know why?
Because you' re just too sensitive!
I' m about to go out of my mind here.
It' s been wonderful, and God knows I love you, but enough is enough!
I just wanna be with a man who will ignore me and take me for granted... and who' s only pretending to be interested in who I am... and what I think so he can get into my pants.
- That would be me.
- Oh, thank you!
Let' s get out of here.
Alison, wait!
Alison!
I' il get into your pants!
Oh, Elliot, get out of there, you silly boy.
- Oh, man, you are so bad.
- Why, thank you.
You' re not very good at this whole instant travel thing, are you?
I' m sorry.
Now then, what were we talking about?
Oh, your next wish, wasn' t it?
Don' t think I don' t see what you' re doing.
I make wishes, you think up ways to ruin them.
I' ve ruined them?
How can you say that?
I' m not perfect, you know.
Do you think I enjoy this?
Everybody hates me.
I can' t sleep.
And when I actually try to help someone, they turn on me like I' m supposed to be God or something.
I work hard.
I try to look good for you.
You do look good.
You- You look very good.
Oh, come on.
I do like you.
It' s just I' m feeling a little frustrated here.
Don' t give up on me, Elliot.
I' m not giving up on you.
Nobody gets it totally right right away.
You' re doing great, really.
- I am?
I' m so sorry your wish didn' t work out.
Friends?
Listen, I' m sorry if I said anything to upset you or make you feel bad.
- I think you' re sensitive enough already.
Are you kidding?
Hey!
Were you just faking me out?
I was 100% sincere.
- [Chuckling]
- Now, what have we learned so far?
Well, let' s see.
- I' m starting to think women don' t know what they want.
They say they want sensitivity, but did you see how fast Alison went for...
- Which tells you?
- Go on.
- And I wanna be athletic.
- Check.
- And I wanna be rich too.
But I want it to be for something that I like doing, and people really like me for.
Great!
This is getting really specific.
Let' s see -- big, strong, rich, athletic, something you like, lots of fans --
- Are you thinking what I' m thinking?
- In the form of a wish?
- I wish I could play professional basketball.
Then I' il just say the magic words:
Dennis Rodman.
Just kidding.
Michael Jordan.
Yeah!
Three, two, one!
And that' s it.
That' s the game.
The score:
Elliot Richards has totally dominated.
If you' re just tuning in, it' s a shame because you just missed... one of the greatest performances in the history of sports.
Absolutely, Jerry.
People said basketball caught fire with the "ascendry" of Michael Jordan.
But I tell you, after what we seen here tonight, a lot of people are gonna be saying, "Michael who?"
[Jerry]
Right from the get- go, the fans took a look at Elliot Richards... and a couple women fainted.
And a couple fellas -- I' d rather not say -- but they liked what they saw.
[Dan]
Absolutely.
He' s a big fella and an imposing fella.
He' s enormous.
He' s listed at 7' 6 "in the program, but I' d say he plays the game like he' s 11 feet tall.
No, I don' t think he that big, Jerry.
No, I' m saying the game he plays is- is- is -- is that of some Viking giant... with a basketball in one hand and a club in the other... standing 10, 11, 12 feet tall.
It' s obvious Elliot Richards controlled this game right from the tip- off.
Right from the get- go, Elliot was a dominating force in tonight' s game.
He was PhiSlammaJamma runnin 'stank all over it... with rib- ticklin' jumps of double vanilla funk.
Let' s take a look.
Here' s a pass worthy of John Elway.
For the dunk!
Here he is lining up for the three.
It' s good!
Here comes his patented over- the- shoulder, no- look three- pointer.
They' re in the zone.
Here he is soaring through the air like the man... on the flying "trapezius" and bam!
Destroying the backboard on the glass.
This kid' s an animal.
- Let' s take a look at that dunker again.
- It' s boom!
Humpty- hump- dump- dump.
I love this game, folks.
Elliot Richards spitting glass at your ass.
Bob is courtside with Elliot Richards now.
Let' s go to Bob Bob.
Thank you, Jerry and Dan.
Elliot, you must be one very proud young man this evening.
Simply put, that was a staggeringly dramatic display of athletic ability.
Uh, well, you know, you go out there and you give 110%.
And you wanna play good.
And you hope you play good.
I think we played pretty good tonight.
Well, in the lexicon of sports terminology, and I don' t mean to sound contrary here, the word "good" falls tragically short of encompassing the sheer virtuosity of your performance.
Um, well, you know, there' s no "I" in the word "team" and this is a team effort.
And I just wanna say that I' m real proud to be associated with... these fine individuals that I have the pleasure of working with.
Now, I would never wanna dis your team mates in any way, shape or form, but you do realize that you smashed Wilt Chamberlain' s unbreakable record... of 100 points in a single basketball game set in Hershey, Pennsylvania, years ago?
Man, you just gotta play one game at a time and go out there and give 110%... and you gotta show that you want it more than they do when the chips fall where they may.
Thank you very much.
All right!
Diablos!
Yeah!
Elliot.
Hi.
- Oh.
It' s nice to meet you, ma' am.
God, I can' t tell you how thrilled I am to meet you.
I was just wondering if there was a possibility... you might consider doing something exclusive with me, uh, for the magazine?
Maybe more intimate, one- on- one, just the two of us.
Yeah, right.
I' d kill you in one- on- one.
Shoot!
God, it' s so exciting to be here.
I mean, uh, you must have an enormously huge... talent to do what you do.
And, uh, you hope you play good.
You wanna play good.
- I think we played pretty good tonight.
I mean, watching you,
I just kept thinking how unbelievably big... your, uh, ego must be after a game like that.
Oh, not that big, really.
- I bet it' s pretty big.
- Whoo.
- Heck.
Wanna go back to my place?
I' il show you my bottle cap collection.
Oh, God, that would -- that would be tremendous.
- All right, well -- - God.
I should, uh -- I should get dressed.
I can' t wait.
Oh, my God!
Hey, what the hell!
Oh, God, there' s --
Damn!
- Oh!
- I just remembered there' s just this teeny, tiny thing...
- I forgot to do.
- What' s teeny?
- No, no, no.
- About me?
Yeah, just a little, short, itty- bitty blurb about tonight' s game.
Well, uh, can I see you after the road trip?
I would love to, but I' m -- I' m working on a really big, huge, enormous story on the N. F. L., so I probably won' t have time.
Oh, shoot.
I understand.
You gotta give 110%.
- Stay within yourself.
Hey, oh, yeah.
Hey, um, thanks for your time.
So long.
What the hell?
Oh, damn the Devil.
Damn the Devil to Hell!
Darn it!
Where the heck did I put that --
[Growls]
[Grumbling]
[Screams]
- Now what are you doing?
- You seem so upset, Elliot.
Do you want something to relax?
You bet I' m upset.
You gave me, like, this little teeny- weeny winkie.
Well, that' s easily fixed, you know.
Now then, let' s see.
Here' s some M& Ms for room 320.
- Red Hots for 316.
- You' re giving them candy?
Placebos.
They work just as well as the real thing.
It' s a scientific fact.
You can' t give sick people Tic Tacs!
Sick people have notoriously bad breath.
I' m performing a public service here.
Now then, about your next wish.
Um --
Well, I wanna be smart.
No, I wanna be really smart.
And I wanna be able to talk good -- well.
- What is the word -- - "Articulate"?
Articulate.
Yeah.
I wanna be articulate.
And I wanna be witty and sophisticated, charming.
I wanna know everything about everything... and I wanna be popular and I wanna be good- looking.
No, no, make that great- looking.
And I want Alison to fall absolutely head over heels in love with me.
- Anything else?
- Like what?
Like winkie- wise?
Oh, right.
Um --
Yeah, well, um,
I wanna be -- I wanna be big.
Not like practical joke big, but, you know, sort of --
Yeah, like that.
Is that clear?
Crystal.
You just say "I wish" and I' il fill in the rest.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
You' ve got it, smarty- pants.
Take two of these and call me in the morning.
Oh, Elliot!
Oh, it so wonderful to see you, darling.
Oh, New York has been so deadly dull without you.
Where have you been?
Oh, out in the Hamptons, of course.
Up to my ears in my new book.
Another one?
My God.
- What' s this one about?
- Oh, same old, same old.
It' s a critical deconstruction of the Neo- Romantic period in art and literature... from the political and economic perspective of the Industrial Revolution.
I can' t imagine who reads this stuff!
Well, Elliot, the critics, apparently.
It' s already won the Pulitzer Prize and it hasn' t even been published yet.
Well, like they say, Dr. Oingegedaydegegedaybaba, a Pulitzer Prize and $3. 50 will get you a cafe latte.
So modest.
Darling, you really should get around.
Mingle.
Oh, darling, you look fabulous.
Badgely Mishka?
Who is that?
- Oh, that' s Elliot Richards.
He' s a very successful writer.
He' s a very successful everything, as a matter of fact.
That' s Elliot Richards?
Oh, I' ve read all his books.
I had no idea he was so handsome.
Well, why don' t you go over and talk to him?
- I couldn' t.
What would I say?
Just, uh, let him do all the talking.
It' s a common misapprehension that the word "gin" comes from the city Geneva.
Actually, the word "geneva" -- small "g" -- is a corruption of genievre, which of course is French for "juniper" the wonderful berry that flavors this miraculous libation.
[Guests Chuckling]
Speaking of miraculous.
How do you do?
I know who you are.
I' m Alison Gardner.
I just had to tell you how much I loved your novel Always Toujours.
Well, I was just trying to make a simple point really.
Every time I' ve reread Camus and Sartre,
- Yes.
- Yes, we' re alone in the universe.
Yes, life is meaningless, death is inevitable.
But is that necessarily so depressing?
I couldn' t agree more.
Don' t you think that secular humanism is yummy?
Ooh, delish.
My, my.
They say that alcohol is a disinhibitor and it seems to be working very well on me.
Me too.
What an exquisite feeling.
Every cell in my body just wants to reach out and touch someone.
Yes, it' s incredible, isn' t it?
Thyphysiology of touch.
Just below your epidermis, concentrated in your fingertips, the palms of your hands, the soles of your feet, the clitoris, nipples, penis,
lips, tongue.
I' m tingling all over.
Do you know the largest organ in the human body?
I can guess.
You' d be wrong.
It' s your integumentary system.
Your... creamy... soft... and completely desirable skin.
- Can we go to your place?
- Mais certainment.
Oh, this is so perfect.
"Elliot Richards."
- [Record Scratches]
- What the hell is going on, Mary?
- Who are you?
- Don' t play games with me, Mr. Richards.
I' ve been out of my mind all night.
- Oh, my God.
Who' s your little friend?
- Maybe I should be running along.
- Wait.
I' m not gay.
Oh, really?
And I' m Tony Danza!
- Honestly, I swear it.
I' m not.
- Then tell me, who was in the Broadway cast of The Pajama Game?
Janis Paige, John Raitt, Eddy Foy, Jr.
I assume you mean the original cast because there was a revival in 1973 that starred...
- I rest my case.
Wait.
I can prove to you that I am not gay.
Kiss me.
This is just sad!
Will you shut up, bitch!
Please, Alison, let me kiss you.
Remember the champagne and the corpuscles?
All right, Elliot, kiss me.
[Groans]
I' m gay.
Well, thanks for dropping by.
- Good night.
- All right.
Bu- bye.
You' ve been drinking again, haven' t you?
This is like the night you had all those Brandy Alexanders and ran up and down Fire I sland... withyour cute little Speedos singing "Evergreen."
And so the cow was returned to its rightful owner.
- Okay, boys, tonight' s homework.
- [Class Groans]
"X" to the nth plus "Y" to the nth equals "Z" to the nth.
You' re never gonna use that, are you?
"Imperialism and the First World War."
Well, what' s done is done, I say.
No point in thinking about it now.
"German, French, Spanish."
Ja, ja.
Oui, oui.
Everyone speaks English anyway.
And if they don' t, they ought to.
So, no homework tonight.
But I want you to watch a lot of television, don' t neglect your video games... and I' il see you in the morning, shall we say, 10: 00, 10: 30?
No point in getting up too early, is there?
[Bell Ringing]
Elliot, darling.
What a lovely surprise.
- I hope you had a pleasant evening.
- As if you didn' t know.
I know it must be really frustrating for you.
- I' il make it up to you somehow.
- Oh, yeah, you' ve been a really big help so far.
I know.
I' ve been really naughty, haven' t I?
Is that all you ever think about?
Do you think everything is about sex?
I mean, there' s greed, gluttony, sloth, anger, vanity, envy.
Oh.
You' re just a big Boy Scout, aren' t you?
I find that incredibly appealing.
All I' ve been doing is thinking about myself.
I could be doing all these really important things to help other people.
- What about Alison?
- Oh, I don' t know anymore.
You mess it up anyway.
I know that Alison' s not really like that.
What exactly do you have in mind?
I wanna do something great for mankind.
I wanna help create a better world.
I wanna go down in history for doing something really, really important... and I want Alison to take me really seriously and to treat me with respect.
I sense a wish coming on.
Yes!
I wish that I was the President of the United States.
That is the noblest, most unselfish thing I' ve ever heard.
And it' s a great way to meet girls.
Bless you, Elliot Richards, and Godspeed.
Mr. President.
Alison Gardner.
We' re so honored to have you here, sir.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The actors are beside themselves with excitement.
We' re going to a play?
I think you' il find it quite amusing.
It' s called Our American Cousin.
I think I' ve already seen it.
As a matter of fact, I' m sure I have.
I don' t think you' ve seen it, sir.
It' s an entirely new play.
Really?
I think I know how it ends, anyway.
- Can' t we just go to a movie?
- [Announcer]
- ["Hail To The Chief"]
[Champagne Cork Pops]
You seem tense tonight, Mr. President.
Can I help you find something, Mr. President?
Yeah, I' m looking for my pager.
- Your what, sir?
It' s this...
Looks kind of like a cell phone, only smaller.
- [Groans]
- I' m sorry!
Ha!
All right.
No problem!
No problem.
Wait!
- [Screams]
- [Gunshot]
[Clears Throat]
See that it doesn' t.
I don' t think a person with your extremely limited... personal and professional skills can afford to push the envelope.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
- [Typing]
So, tell me, how was it?
I' m dying to know.
What are you doing here?
Just think of me as a computer virus.
I think of you as a plague.
Whoa.
What' s this whole "get thee behind me" thing?
We still have business here, Mr. Richards.
No, not now.
I told you, I' ve got work to do.
And besides, I' ve only got two wishes left and I don' t wanna screw 'em up.
You have one wish left.
Nice try.
I' ve got two more coming.
Nuh- uh.
Count 'em, baby.
- You were President of the United States.
- Yeah, okay, one.
Uh- huh, yeah.
And you turned me into a flaming homosexual.
- Three.
The sensitive, caring, artistic guy was four.
And the Columbian drug lord was five.
That means I have two more coming.
You forgot the Big Mac and Coke.
What?
That wasn' t a wish.
What do you call it?
You said, "I wish" and I got it for you.
No, that' s not fair!
Who do you think you' re talking to?
I don' t recall anybody ever accusing me of being fair before.
- I think I' m insulted.
No, this isn' t right.
You can' t do this.
Sue me?
No, that' s it!
I' ve had it with you.
The whole deal is off.
Off!
Shut up!
[Pipe Organ]
Are you all right?
I need to talk to God.
That' s the power of prayer.
Just say what' s in your heart and He hears.
No, you don' t understand.
I really need to talk to Him now.
- It' s urgent.
- Is it something you could tell me?
Um, no, it' s personal.
Um --
Why don' t you just try me?
Okay, a few days ago I sold my soul to the Devil for seven wishes.
I' ve already had five of them, but the Devil says I' ve had six, but I' m not counting the Big Mac and Coke and she is and I don' t think that' s fair.
Do you?
- This is so unnecessary.
- You' re coming downtown with us.
- I' m telling you, the Devil gypped me for a ham burger!
- Tell your story to the sergeant.
So, do you have a copy of this contract?
I told you, she keeps it in her office.
- At this nightclub in Oakland?
- Yes, at a nightclub, and no I can' t tell you where it is.
Because you promised the Devil you wouldn' t?
No, because she drove, that' s why!
Right, in a Lamborghini Diablo.
- Look, Officer -- - Sergeant.
Sergeant, I know my rights.
I don' t have to talk to you without a lawyer.
So, you either book me or you let me go.
Gee, are those my choices?
Oh, what do I do, what do I do?
I choose "book you."
Throw him in the lockup.
- Arraignment in the morning.
Hey!
- Recommending psychiatric evaluation.
- It' s her!
She' s the Devil!
One more word out of you and I' il pop you one, you goddamn wacko bastard.
Spread 'em.
You have to learn to accept the inevitable.
We' re all doomed anyway, so you might as well just get with the program, wish your way out of here and move on.
I wasn' t kidding when I said I liked you.
I do, Elliot.
I think you have massive potential.
If you' re looking at an eternity in Hell,
let me tell you, it wouldn' t hurt to have a friend like me.
So you just think about that and give me a call when you' re ready.
[Cell DoorShuts]
[Man]
She' s the devil, that one.
What?
I said, she' s the devil, that lady cop.
Yeah, I guess.
- So, what you in for, brother?
That' s a long time.
You must' ve did some really bad shit.
Yeah.
I sold my soul.
Hope you got something good for it.
As a matter of fact, I got nothing for it.
That' s a really bad deal, if you ask me.
I' m not asking you.
Doesn' t really matter, though.
- You can' t sell your soul, anyway.
- Oh, really?
Why do you say that?
Doesn' t really belong to you in the first place.
No way, no how.
So, who does it belong to?
It belongs to God, that universal spirit that animates and binds all things in existence.
The Devil gonna try to confuse you.
But that' s her gig.
But in the end, you' re gonna see clear to who and what you are and what you' re here to do.
Now, you' re gonna make some mistakes along the way.
Everybody does.
But if you just open up your heart... and open up your mind, you' il get it.
Who are you?
[Techno Dance]
[Chattering]
Elliot!
[Man]
You the man, Elliot!
So nice of you to drop by.
- Come into my office.
- [Muttering]
Oh, don' t worry about them, darling.
They' re having a fabulous time.
Everybody wants to go to the party, but nobody wants to pay the piper.
- Are you -- - Don' t get too excited.
It' s just a Halloween costume.
Anyway, Elliot, my darling, have you thought of your last wish?
- No.
Read your contract.
I really don' t want another wish.
[Scoffs]
Do you think this halo' s too much?
I really don' t want it.
What do you mean, you don' t want it?
You get seven wishes.
There' s nothing I want.
Well, there are things that I want, but nothing that you can give me.
What is that supposed to mean?
last night when I was lying in jail, I was talking to this guy,
I realized that wishing just doesn' t work.
And I always thought, "Wouldn' t it be great if someone could just wave a magic wand... and make that happen.,,
Well, I realized that it doesn' t work by magic.
I think I' m gonna be sick.
I' ve been starting to think that... it really isn' t that important how far we go in life anyway.
Oh.
Do you know, that is so inspiring.
So, it' s okay?
Well, no, Elliot.
I' m afraid it' s not okay.
A deal' s a deal.
You get one more wish and I get your soul.
So, let' s just get on with it, shall we?
- I' m not gonna do it.
- Oh, really?
Well, before you get all hinky, I think I should warn you,
I' m not all peaches and cream, you know.
I do have a darker side, and believe me, it' s not pretty.
Now, you can go easy or you can go hard, but one way or another I will get your soul!
I' m not gonna do it.
There' s nothing that you can say or do that will make me.
Oh, I think you' il change your mind.
I' m just gonna slip into something a I ittle more terrifying.
See you in Hell!
Wait a minute!
[Screams]
Wait!
Now listen to me, you disgusting little maggot!
This is your last chance before the big weenie roast.
Okay!
Okay!
Oh, God.
[Screaming]
- Is this Heaven?
- Heaven?
God, no, it' s the courthouse.
I' m just meeting a couple of lawyers for lunch -- clients of mine.
Come on.
Well, wait.
What happened to the whole... you know, fire and the big horny guy with the --
Oh, just a few special effects.
Sort of the Universal Studios Tour of Evil.
Normally it works pretty well, but evidently you weren' t going for it.
- What?
Nobody ever reads the contract.
Article 147, paragraph 9, subsection 3:
"Selfless Acts of Redemption."
- Basically, it says... ifyou commit one truly benevolent act, it voids the contract.
- So I get to keep my soul?
- Yes, you get to keep your soul.
Yes!
Oh, yes!
Hoo!
On November 16, I' il have been doing this for 6, 000 years... and you' re the first person to give away one of their wishes.
I hope it' s not the beginning of a trend.
You' re not gonna tell anyone, are you?
No, no, I promise.
Nope.
I don' t get it, though.
I mean, why are you... being nice?
Look, Elliot, I' m gonna let you in on a little secret.
The whole good and evi lthing, you know, Him and me, it really comes down to you.
You don' t have to look very hard for Heaven and Hell.
They' re right here on Earth.
You make the choice.
And I guess you just made yours.
So, I can go now?
Unless you want another seven wishes.
No thanks.
I didn' t think so.
I really liked you, you know.
Well, to tell you the truth, you' ve been the best friend I' ve ever had.
Don' t go gushy on me now.
Go.
You' il scare the fish away.
Hi.
Hi.
Elliot Richards.
We' ve met a couple of times.
Yeah, I remember.
How are you?
I' m great.
I' m exaggerating.
I' m -- I' m good.
Um, the thing is we' ve been working togetherhere for the last four years, and I' ve always noticed you and thought that... you looked like, um, a very interesting person.
I don' t know how interesting I am.
Well, the truth is I don' t know you and you don' t know me, and I was thinking that if we were to get to know each other that... there' s a chance that we just might hit it off.
So I was wondering if you wanted to go get a cup of coffee or --
That' s really so nice of you.
Oh.
Well, of course you are.
You' re --
He' s sure one lucky guy.
Uh, listen, if it ever doesn' t work out with him, then --
- That is so nice of you.
- No, thanks a lot.
- I' il see you around.
- Okay, take care.
Bye.
- It' s a joke.
What' s he gonna --
Hey, Elliot, fo- felliot, so- smElliot.
[Chuckles]
What do you say we go down to the club tonight and we, uh, pick up some chickettes?
[Muttering]
- Hey.
- New neighbors?
Hi.
You must be the boy next door.
Do you wanna give me a hand?
Habla ingles?
Sprechen Sie English?
Parlez vous Americano?
- Hi.
I' m Elliot Richards.
Nicole DeLarusso.
Don' t call me Nicky, though. 'cause everyone always calls me "Nicky."
It starts off as Nicole, then it becomes Nicky, then Nick, then Ni, then just "Nn."
I' m cracking myself up here.
- Hey, do you wanna give me a hand?
That way you wouldn' t have to cook.
Thank you.
Say, Nicole, you wouldn' t happen to have a sister, would you?
I have a lot of brothers, though.
Yeah, yeah
Change your mind
You' ve had enough of all your trying
We' ve both heard seize the day
What' s your hurry What' s your hurry anyway
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Change your mind
I' ve got an appointment with Mr. UIlman.
My name is Jack Torrance.
His office is the first door on the Ieft.
Mr. UIlman?
I' m Jack Torrance.
Come on in, Jack.
- Nice to meet you.
- Susie, how do you do?
- Any trouble finding us?
I made the trip in 3 1 / 2 hours.
That' s very good time.
Just make yourself at home.
Like some coffee?
Thanks.
And ask BiII Watson to join us.
Do you reaIly want to go and Iive in that hoteI for the winter?
It' II be Iots of fun.
I guess so.
Anyway, there' s hardly anybody to play with around here.
It always takes a Iittle time to make new friends.
Yeah, I guess so.
He' s Iooking forward to the hotel, I bet.
No, I ain 't, Mrs. Torrance.
Now, come on, Tony.
I don 't want to go there.
How come you don' t want to go?
I just don 't.
Did they give you any idea in Denver...... about what the job entails?
Only in a very generaI way.
The winters can be fantasticaIly cruel.
The basic idea is to cope with the very costly damage...... and depreciation which can occur.
This consists mainly of running the boiler...... heating different parts of the hoteI on a daily rotating basis...... repairing damage as it occurs...... and doing repairs so the elements can' t get a foothold.
That sounds fine to me.
PhysicaIly, it' s not a very demanding job.
The only thing that can get a bit trying here during the winter...... is a tremendous sense of isolation.
That just happens to be exactly what I' m Iooking for.
I' m outlining a new writing project.
Five months of peace is just what I want.
Because, for some people...... solitude...... and isolation...... can, of itself, become a problem.
Not for me.
Do you think they' II take to it?
Great.
Before I turn you over to BiIl...... there' s one other thing I think we should talk about.
Not to sound melodramatic...... but it' s been known to give a few people...... second thoughts about the job.
I' m intrigued.
I don' t suppose they said anything in Denver...... about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970.
I don' t believe they did.
My predecessor in this job...... hired a man named Charles Grady as the winter caretaker.
He came up with his wife and 2 Iittle girls of about 8 and 10.
He had a good employment record, good references.
And from what I' ve been told, he seemed...... Iike a completely normaI individual.
But at some point during the winter...... he must have suffered some kind of a complete mentaI breakdown.
He ran amuck...
... and kiIled his family with an ax.
Stacked them neatly in a room in the west wing, and then...... he put both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth.
The police thought...... that it was what the old- timers used to caII cabin fever.
A kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur...... when people are shut in together over Iong periods of time.
Yeah, it is.
It' s stiII hard for me to believe it actuaIly happened here.
But it did.
I think you can appreciate why I wanted to teII you about it.
I certainly can.
I also understand why your people in Denver...... Ieft it for you to teII me.
Obviously, some people can be put off...... from staying in a place where something Iike that happened.
You can rest assured that' s not going to happen with me.
And as far as my wife is concerned...... I' m sure she' II be absolutely fascinated when I teII her.
She' s a confirmed ghost story...... and horror film addict.
Tony, do you think Dad' II get the job?
He already did.
He' s going to phone Wendy up in a few minutes to tell her.
How' s it going?
I' m at the hoteI and I stiII have a Iot to do.
I don' t think I can get home before 9 or 10.
Sounds Iike you got the job.
It' s a beautifuI place.
You and Danny are going to love it.
Tony, why don' t you want to go to the hotel?
I don 't know.
Now come on, teII me.
I don 't want to.
No.
Now, Tony, teII me.
We must reaIly be high up.
The air feels so different.
I' m hungry.
You should' ve eaten your breakfast.
Okay, Mom.
Wasn' t it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
I think that was farther west, in the Sierras.
What was the Donner party?
They were a party of settlers in covered wagon times.
They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.
They had to resort to cannibalism in order to stay alive.
You mean they ate each other up?
Jack.
I know aII about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.
See, it' s okay.
He saw it on the television.
- What time does the plane Ieave?
That gives us plenty of time to go over everything.
- Goodbye, Mr. UIlman.
I hope you haven' t been waiting too Iong.
We had time to grab a bite to eat.
Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.
Is your family having a Iook around?
No, my son' s discovered the games room.
- Right there.
In view of aII we have to cover today...... I suggest we have a quick Iook at your apartment and get started.
Have the Torrances' things brought to their apartment.
I' d better coIlect my family first.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
It' s beautiful.
It sure is.
This is the staff wing of the hotel.
None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
- Goodbye, Mr. UIlman.
- Goodbye, girls.
And here are your quarters.
And a smaII bedroom for your son.
Perfect for a child.
When was the Overlook built?
Construction started in 1907.
It was finished in 1909.
The site' s supposedly on an Indian buriaI ground.
They had to repeI a few Indian attacks as they were building it.
That' s our Snowcat.
Can you both drive a car?
BasicaIly the Snowcat operates very much Iike a car.
It won' t take you Iong to get the hang of it.
This is it.
How do you Iike it, Danny?
It' s the biggest place I ever seen.
This whole place is such an enormous maze.
I' II have to Ieave a traiI of breadcrumbs every time I come in.
It' s big, but it ain' t nothing but a kitchen.
A Iot of this stuff you' II never have to touch.
I wouldn' t know what to do with it if I did.
One thing for sure, you don' t have to worry about food.
You could eat here for a year and never have the same menu twice.
Right here is our walk- in freezer.
This is where we keep aII of our meat.
You got 15 rib roasts...... 30 ten- pound bags of hamburger.
We got 12 turkeys, about 40 chickens...... 50 sirloin steaks, two dozen pork roast...... and 20 Iegs of Iamb.
You Iike Iamb, Doc?
What' s your favorite food?
French fries and ketchup.
Come along.
How' d you know we caII him Doc?
- You caIled Danny "Doc" twice.
I did?
We caII him Doc sometimes, Iike in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.
But how did you know?
I guess I heard you caII him that.
But I don' t remember...... caIling him that since we' ve been with you.
Anyway, he Iooks Iike a Doc, doesn' t he?
Now, this is the storeroom.
In here is where we keep aII the dried goods and the canned goods.
We got canned fruits and vegetables...... canned fish and meats, hot and cold cereals.
You got a dozen jugs of black molasses.
We got 60 boxes of dried milk...
How' d you like some ice cream, Doc?
... Sociables, finger roIls...... and 7 kinds of what have you.
We' ve got dried peaches, dried apricots...... dried raisins and dried prunes.
You know, you got to keep regular if you want to be happy.
- How' re you getting on?
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We' re on our way to the basement.
I promise we won' t keep her very Iong.
No problem.
I was just getting to the ice cream.
You Iike ice cream, Doc?
I thought so.
- We don' t mind.
- Sound good to you, Doc?
Okay, you behave yourself.
What kind of ice cream do you Iike?
Chocolate.
Come on, son.
It' s amazing, aII this activity today.
The guests and some staff Ieft yesterday, but the...... Iast day' s always hectic.
Everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
By 5: 00 tonight, you' II never know anybody was ever here.
Just Iike a ghost ship, huh?
Do you know how I knew your name was Doc?
You know what I' m talking about, don' t you?
I can remember when I was a Iittle boy...... my grandmother and I could hold conversations...... entirely without ever opening our mouths.
She caIled it "shining."
And for a Iong time I thought it was just the two of us...... that had "the shine" to us.
Like you probably thought you was the only one.
But there are other folks...... though mostly they don' t know it, or don' t believe it.
How Iong have you been able to do it?
Why don' t you want to talk about it?
I' m not supposed to.
Who says you ain' t supposed to?
Tony.
Who' s Tony?
Tony' s the Iittle boy that Iives in my mouth.
Is Tony the one that teIls you things?
How does he teII you things?
It' s Iike I go to sleep and he shows me things.
But when I wake up, I can' t remember everything.
Does your mom and dad know about Tony?
Do they know he teIls you things?
Tony told me never to teII them.
Has Tony ever told you anything about this place?
About the Overlook Hotel?
I don' t know.
Think.
Is there something bad here?
You know, Doc, when something happens...... it can Ieave a trace of itself behind.
Say, Iike...... if someone burns toast.
Maybe things that happen Ieave other kind of traces behind.
Not things that anyone can notice.
But things that people who shine can see.
Just Iike they can see things that haven' t happened yet...
... sometimes they can see things that happened a Iong time ago.
I think a Iot of things happened right here...... in this particular hoteI over the years.
And not aII of them was good.
What about Room 237?
Room 237?
You' re scared of Room 237, ain' t you?
No, I ain' t.
Mr. HaIlorann, what is in Room 237?
Nothing.
There ain' t nothing in Room 237.
But you ain' t got no business going in there anyway.
So stay out.
You understand?
Your breakfast is ready.
What time is it?
It' s about 11: 30.
I know it.
Nice.
It' s reaIly pretty outside.
How about taking me for a walk after you finish your breakfast?
I suppose I ought to try to do some writing first.
Any ideas yet?
Lots of ideas.
No good ones.
Something wiII come.
It' s just a matter of settling into the habit of writing every day.
That' s aII it is.
- And you' re going to Iose.
You' d better run fast!
I' m coming in close.
Keep America clean.
Danny, you win.
Let' s take the rest of this walking.
Give me your hand.
Isn' t it beautiful?
Dead end.
We made it.
Isn' t it beautiful?
Did you?
How' s it going?
Fine.
Get a Iot written today?
The weather forecast said it' s going to snow tonight.
What do you want me to do about it?
Don' t be so grouchy.
I' m not...... being grouchy.
I just want to finish my work.
I' II come back Iater with a couple of sandwiches.
Maybe you' II Iet me read something then.
Wendy...... Iet me explain something to you.
When you come in and interrupt, you' re breaking my concentration.
You' re distracting me...... and it wiII then take time to get back to where I was.
Understand?
We' re making a new rule:
... or whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here...... when I' m in here, that means I am working.
That means don' t come in.
Do you think you can handle that?
Fine.
Why don' t you start right now and get the fuck out of here?
I knew it.
This is KDK 12 caIling KDK 1.
This is KDK 1.
We' re receiving you.
This is Wendy Torrance at the Overlook Hotel.
How are you folks getting on up there?
Over.
But our telephones aren' t doing too weIl.
Are the Iines down, by any chance?
Yes, quite a few of them are down due to the storm.
Any chance of them being repaired soon?
Most winters they stay that way untiI spring.
This storm is reaIly something, isn' t it?
It' s one of the worst we' ve had for years.
Anything else we can do for you, Mrs. Torrance?
I suppose not.
And, Mrs. Torrance?
It might be a good idea if you leave your radio on all the time.
We' II do that.
Bye.
Over and out.
HeIlo, Danny.
Come and play with us.
Come and play with us, Danny.
Forever...
... and ever...... and ever.
Tony...... I' m scared.
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.
"It' s just like pictures in a book, Danny.
It isn 't real. "
Can I go to my room and get my fire engine?
Come here for a minute first.
How' s it going, Doc?
Having a good time?
I want you to have a good time.
I am, Dad.
Do you feeI bad?
I' m just a Iittle bit tired.
Then why don' t you go to sleep?
I can' t.
I got too much to do.
Do you Iike this hotel?
I love it.
Don' t you?
I guess so.
Good.
I want you to Iike it here.
I wish we could stay here forever...... and ever...... and ever.
You would never hurt Mommy or me, would you?
What do you mean?
That I would hurt you?
No, Dad.
You sure?
Yes, Dad.
I love you, Danny.
I love you more than anything else...... in the whole world.
I would never do anything to hurt you...... never.
You know that, don' t you?
Good.
Mom, are you in there?
What happened?
Honey...... what' s wrong?
I had the most...... terrible nightmare I ever had.
- It' s okay now.
ReaIly.
I dreamed that I...... that I kiIled you and Danny.
But I didn' t just kiII you.
I cut you up into Iittle pieces.
I must be Iosing my mind.
Everything' s going to be aII right.
Let' s get up off the floor.
Everything' s okay!
Just go play in your room for a while.
Your dad' s just got a headache.
Honey, Iet me just get him out of here.
I' II be right back.
Why don' t you mind me?
What happened to your neck?
What happened to your neck?
You did this to him...... didn' t you?!
Didn' t you?!
How could you?!
I' d give anything for a drink.
I' d give my goddamn soul...... for just a glass of beer.
Hi, Lloyd.
A Iittle slow tonight, isn' t it?
Yes it is, Mr. Torrance.
What wiII it be?
I' m awfuIly glad you asked me that, Lloyd...... because I just happen to have two twenties...... and two tens right here in my waIlet.
I was afraid they' d be there untiI next April.
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...... a Iittle glass and some ice.
You can do that, can' t you?
You' re not too busy, are you?
I' m not busy at aIl.
Good man.
You set them up...... and I' II knock them back, one by one.
White man' s burden.
Say, Lloyd...... it seems I' m temporarily Iight.
How' s my credit in this joint, anyway?
Your credit' s fine, Mr. Torrance.
That' s sweIl.
I Iike you, Lloyd.
I always Iiked you.
You were always the best of them.
Best goddamn bartender...... from Timbuktu to Portland, Maine.
Or Portland, Oregon, for that matter.
Thank you for saying so.
I didn' t.
I wouldn' t touch one hair on his goddamn Iittle head.
I love the Iittle son of a bitch.
I' d do anything for him.
Any fucking thing for him.
But that bitch!
As Iong as I Iive...... she' II never Iet me forget what happened.
I did hurt him once, okay?
It was an accident.
Completely unintentional.
- Get the corpse from the well.
- Yes, sir.
Mr Yamamura.
Don' t.
I haven' t seen her since she was a child.
The well was on Dr Ikuma' s estate.
It was sealed when they sold the place 30 years ago...... and it was never opened after that.
But that is Sadako.
There' s no record of a "Sadako", not in Dr Ikuma' s or the mother' s family.
What happened to Dr Ikuma?
He died right after the place was sold.
I' m the only one left alive.
Burn her!
Dispose of the ashes wherever you want.
I' m afraid that' s not possible.
It' s a very strange case.
One of the people who found her is dead, and the other' s vanished.
And there' s one more thing...
The time of death.
According to the autopsy she died only a year or two ago.
What?
That means that she was alive down there the entire time...
For 30 years.
{y: i} Everyone' s talking about {y: i} this "video curse".
{y: i} What happens in it?
{y: i} I' ve heard that it' s a creepy woman - {y: i} - who tells you that you will die {y: i} in one week' s time.
{y: i} They say she appears if you watch TV {y: i} late at night.
Then the phone rings.
{y: i} TV?
What channel?
{y: i} - Some localstation in Izu.
{y: i} - Izu?
Do you really want to use this?
Why not?
You die if you don' t show it to someone within a week...
We' il have to get someone to say that on camera.
- Still no word from Reiko?
- No.
The police called about her.
Is Asakawa Reiko here?
No, not at the moment.
{y: i} Everyone' s talking about {y: i} this "video curse".
{y: i} What happens in it?
{y: i} I' ve heard that it' s a creepy woman - {y: i} - who tells you that you will die {y: i} in one week' s time.
Excuse me!
Do you know what this is all about?
We haven' t heard from her.
- A man named Takayama Ryuji died.
- Takayama?
Ms Asakawa' s ex- husband.
The police have been here, too.
She' s been gone for days.
- Have they been inside?
They never asked.
Go ahead.
Ms Takano...
What' s that?
A videotape?
{y: i} Forgive me, father!
{y: i} I had to save Yoichi.
Are you okay?
She asked me about a video when I saw her...
She' s a single mother, so they don' t assign her important stories.
That' s right!
Her boy!
He was in school...
{y: i} - Ms Asakawa?
- She' s not here right now.
{y: i} This is the police.
Ms Asakawa' s {y: i} father was found dead this morning.
- Where' s Mr Kadokura?
- Over there.
- Sir?
- Yes?
- Omuta, Shizuoka Police.
- Thanks for coming.
- Have you found the daughter?
- No.
- The woman in the well?
- We' re reconstructing the face.
We' re going to make a model and ask around the area.
He found the body.
Hang on...
Do you want to see him?
People don' t usually die like that.
- Are you recording something?
- Yes.
We' re wondering if it has anything to do with this note.
Reiko, I got rid of the tape.
There' s nothing to worry about now.
He' s been absent more than ten days.
- What' s the matter?
- Nothing.
Why are you looking for Reiko?
I want to find out why Professor Takayama died.
I' il check around.
I' il call you if I find anything.
Bye.
- Yes?
{y: i} - It' s the police.
{y: i} I know it' s late, but I' d like to ask {y: i} about Takayama Ryuji.
- Ms Takano Mai?
First on the scene?
- Yes.
Can I come in?
Please.
Professor Takayama taught math, didn' t he?
- And you are...?
- His assistant.
Have you ever heard of Yamamura Sadako?
- No.
- Her mother Shizuko?
- No.
- Ikuma Heihachiro?
No.
Takayama Ryuji and Asakawa Reiko were looking for something, right?
- I' m afraid I don' t know.
- I see.
Asakawa Reiko' s father was found dead today.
In a similar state to Professor Takayama.
Do you know what I mean?
Go away, please.
They' d found a corpse in a well.
A woman who died a year or two ago.
But that well was sealed 30 years ago.
It' s hard to imagine, right?
Almost 30 years down there in the dark...
Neither of the hands had nails.
They were found in the sides of the well, where she had tried...
Go away!
All right.
Call me if you hear where Asakawa Reiko is.
It' s just such a strange case.
What' s the "video" all about?
I don' t know.
Nope...
- Do you live around here, Professor?
- Yes.
I can concentrate better here than in my apartment.
- We' re rolling.
- Pick up where we left off.
Three seconds...
You have to copy it and show it to someone within a week.
If you don' t, exactly one week later...
So there was an original video that people copied?
Where did it come from?
It was just there.
Everyone has tapes that they don' t know what' s on.
One had this weird stuff on it.
- How can you tell that it' s that tape?
- You' il know.
- Does anyone have this tape?
- I know people.
They' re scared, so they' re all showing it to each other.
Have you seen it?
Can you get me a copy?
Okay.
Look...
Excuse me.
Work out a price.
She was probably after these four.
They all died exactly one week after they watched the tape.
It' s hard to believe, right?
This is Tomoko.
She was Ms Asakawa' s niece.
There was a friend with her...
Kurahashi...
Kurahashi Masami.
What happened to her?
She can' t speak.
She' s in the hospital at the university.
The doctor can' t talk about a specific patient.
- You can only ask about his research.
- All right.
This way, please.
Ms Kurahashi?
How are you feeling?
Would you like to sit outside for a while?
The doctor said the air would do you good.
Are you still afraid of the TV?
I' il bring a partition so you won' t have to see it.
Okay?
They' re here, Doctor.
Myname' s Kawajiri.
Have a seat.
We put photos of our patients in their files.
- Do you know why?
- In case they run off.
That' s right.
Illness can change people to the point where their families don' t know them.
So we always take pictures.
But when we photographed this patient...... using an ordinary camera...... we came across something strange.
It' s called "spiritphotography".
Something in a person' s mind affects the light.
There have been many cases.
Is that what' s happened here?
We tried just having her hold the film...
Do you see the character?
SADA
You probably think I' m crazy.
The entire university does.
Did you know Takayama Ryuji?
Yes.
He was the only one who would listen to me.
He studied medicine before he switched to math.
Do you know he' s dead?
It was a real shame.
Then why didn' t you attend his funeral?
You can' t see it, right?
There' s no need to rush.
Just take it nice and easy.
What' s wrong?
Are you feeling ill?
Ms Kurahashi...
Get her out of here.
Tomoko?
Tomoko?
Help me...
Help me...
Restrain her!
Help me!
They said that was the first time she has spoken.
Are you going to proceed with Ms Asakawa' s story?
Yes.
I wouldn' t do that.
Why not?
I just wouldn' t.
Did the girl tell you anything?
Wait!
I' m sorry.
Don' t tell anyone.
The power you have now won' t save anyone.
{y: i} Yoichi!
Are you Yoichi?
Where do you live?
Can' t you talk?
Go in there.
It' s not much of a place.
Have a seat.
I want to go to school.
I' m hungry.
Well?
Do you remember Masami?
She was with Tomoko when she died.
Yes.
She passed a TV set at the hospital, and something strange appeared.
What was it?
A well.
You could only see it for a second.
Was that it?
Yes.
You' ve seen it too, haven' t you?
You' il be all right, if that' s all.
But I wouldn' t look at it again.
Masami can' t speak either.
So?
If Yoichi goes on like this...
So what should I do?
Lock him away in some hospital?
What' s it got to do with you?
I' m sorry.
Please leave.
Can I come back and see Yoichi sometime?
Hi.
Here.
You got it?
We said 20, 000, right?
I watched it last night.
Mr Okazaki, you' il watch it too, won' t you?
Sure.
There' s no point if I don' t.
Do you promise?
Of course.
Trust me!
Hang on.
The money...
Don' t forget.
Nice catch.
Here it comes.
Are you studying that already?
Why were you at the station the other day?
Was your mom angry?
Was there someone there?
The woman with long hair.
Let' s eat.
Go and wash your hands.
I think Yoichi won' t speak because he blames me.
That' s not true.
After we left my dad' s place, the TV would come on when Yoichi came near.
Could you talk to Dr Kawajiri?
If he' s like Tomoko' s friend Masami...
You' ve seen Asakawa Reiko.
- I didn' t call him.
- A reporter asked us about a patient.
He' il be here soon.
We' re going to try an experiment.
It might help the boy, too.
Come in.
This way.
What are you going to do?
This is tap water.
The paper can absorb...
... about that much.
Just like before.
Concentrate on the water.
That' s good.
The water has changed.
Some kind of energy has gone from her to the water.
We can explain the film the same way.
It' s energytransfer.
In time all the energy should be transferred.
We' re going to try that now.
Have a seat.
- Are you going to record this?
Just like with the pictures.
- But you' il see the well.
- A well?
- Everyone who sees it dies.
- You' re still alive.
Hayashi... - Mr Okazaki.
This is a blank tape.
Can you set it up?
Masami!
This is dangerous.
If everyone sees it...
There' s something in my head.
The tape.
Even if we get it on tape, videos don' t kill.
Fear can kill.
Prove that, and the energy will dissipate.
- You can leave if you want to.
- No.
Begin.
Just like with the photo film.
Relax and look at the camera.
What' s that sound?
Who' s that?
Doctor!
Ms Kurahashi!
What are you doing?
Some girl called for you...
She said that it' s been a week.
Was it the girl with the tape?
Right.
I' il give her a call.
Good night.
{y: i} - Sawaguchi.
- Is this Kanae?
{y: i} - Yes.
- It' s Okazaki.
- I' ve watched the tape.
{y: i} - Great!
I was really scared.
Don' t you trust me?
{y: i} It was almost time...
You know that strange woman... {y: i} The one in the mirror?
{y: i} - Hello?
- Yes, that' s the one.
{y: i} Didn' t it look like she changed {y: i} into a child for a second?
{y: i} Just before you could see the well.
Where' s the tape now?
{y: i} I got rid of it.
It' s too dangerous.
Nobody else should see it.
{y: i} But you have to show it to someone!
{y: i} You have to, Mr Okazaki.
{y: i} I don' t want you to die.
All right.
{y: i} See you, then.
The woman in the mirror...
Reporter Dies Witnessing Psychic Test
The test destroyed the reputation of a certain Dr Ikuma Heihachiro.
The Fatal Demonstration Yamamura Shizuko and Dr Ikuma
Shizuko...
You can' t just will someone dead.
Dr Ikuma spoke about how intention is a living thing...... and how energy of thought could take physical form.
30 years in a well... 30 years of concentrated thought...... wanting revenge.
We' ve all seen it.
Did Takayama and Ms Asakawa' s father see it before they died?
Why the father?
Did her boy see it?
Him, too?
Just like the girl.
This can' t go on.
Where' s Ms Asakawa?
Tell me!
Yes?
Kanae!
- Kanae!
- Come with me.
We just want to ask a few questions.
Don' t worry.
Just a minute...
{y: i} Get away from here!
{y: i} Run!
{y: i} Can' t you hear me?
Run!
What' s wrong?
Mom!
Yoichi!
Freak!
- Freak!
- Murderer!
Freak!
Yoichi!
Yoichi!
Yoichi!
Dad?
Dad!
We didn' t save Yoichi?
Your child isn' t Yoichi anymore.
{y: i} Yoichi...
{y: i} Yoichi...
No!
Stop it!
{y: i} Okay.
Why won' t this erase?
{y: i} Who did the story start with?
{y: i} It never really starts with anyone.
{y: i} People get anxious, {y: i} and rumors start to fly.
Professor?
What' s wrong?
Let' s go.
Does it look like her?
Yes... just as strange.
We' il take some pictures.
That' s good.
Sadako!
Why did you leave me alive?
I was the one who made you and your mother into a freak show!
Do you want me to return you to the sea?
Is that it?
Do you know the Yamamuras in Sashikiji?
There are lots of Yamamuras around here.
A woman named Shizuko lived here.
Oh, there...
THE YAMAMURA INN
Hello?
This way.
- I' m sorry.
Did I wake you up?
- No.
- Can you promise me something?
- What?
Don' t do that again, no matter what happens.
It' s really scary.
Okay?
Are you on my side?
Of course I am.
Okay.
I put Sadako in the sea.
It' s the only thing I could do.
That' s what Shizuko did with her.
She went off alone when she went into labor.
She came home with a flat stomach, saying she' d put the baby in the sea.
But the next day she came back, and the child was with her.
What' s that sound?
It' s the cave where Sadako was born.
"The River of Offering".
Unwanted children were put here, so the tide would take them.
Who was Sadako' s father?
Hello?
- Yes?
- Is Ms Takano Mai staying here?
No.
- Well, at least you have vacancies...
Sadako!
You' re dead!
{y: i} You' re dead!
You' re safe!
Do you remember what you dreamt about last night?
Okay.
Think of your mother.
That' s good.
Can I speak to you?
The thing that controls him is anger.
His anger summons her.
He can' t control it.
My equipmentis on its way.
I' il try to make Sadako disappear.
There are no ghosts, no next world.
Despite what Takayama said.
Will Yoichi be strong enough?
What' s your suggestion?
What if the police show up?
He can channel the energy.
He' s the best medium.
I' il do it.
- Are you as strong as Takayama?
- Yes.
That doesn' t mean you' il be better than the boy.
What if I saw the video?
All right.
All we need now is water.
Water?
Sea water doesn' t permeate as well.
We need fresh water to absorb Sadako' s bitterness.
Guide the energy into the water.
It will dissolve there.
And Sadako will disappear...
- All right?
- Yes.
Take your places.
Remember that I' m on your side.
Begin.
Close your eyes.
Remember what you saw.
What did you see?
Yes!
Your father and mother are dead.
You' re all alone.
What did you see?
It' s that woman' s fault your mother died.
She betrayed your mother.
That' s right.
It' s my fault.
Good!
Just like that.
Dr Kawajiri!
What' s that?
I can see into the next world.
Sadako...
Sadako...
Take me!
Please.
Take me...... and put an end to this!
No!
Are you okay?
Don' t let go.
Let me fall.
Grab the wall.
I can' t hold you.
Grab the wall!
Ms Takano...
It' s all right.
No more!
Yoichi!
Yoichi?
Yoichi!
Take him.
Professor...
Yoichi, give me your fear.
Give it to me!
Give it to me!
Climb the rope!
Don' t look back.
Help me...
Why are you the only one saved?
Are you still scared?
- No.
Are you?
- Me?
A little bit.
How' s Okazaki doing?
- He' s still in the hospital.
- The hospital?
Where' s the key for this?
Isn' t it this one?
Mr Okazaki.
I need to take your picture.
Can you look this way?
Mr Okazaki?
Look this way.
There you go.
Thanks.
Alex.
He' s picking you up at 3. 30 tomorrow.
The bus leaves the high school for the airport around 5. 00.
How' s my suitcase working out for you?
Mom, you got to leave that on.
The tag made the last flight without the plane crashing... so I figure it' s got to be on or with the bag.
For luck.
Where would you get a nutball idea like that?
I' m still here.
So, seventeen, on the loose... senior trip with your friends in Paris... ten days in the springtime.
Live it up.
You got your whole life ahead of you.
Hitchcock, let me give you a hand with this.
There you go.
Carter, you dick.
- You left this on the bus.
Hey, Christa.
Hi, Blake.
- What are you doing?
- He' s the man.
You guys got everything?
Yeah, Dad, we' re all set.
Does that mean go?
Don' t know.
This is for both of you.
Have a great time.
Thanks, Dad.
- Both of us.
- Let' s go.
- Alex, take care of them.
Didn' t think anything could look worse than my yearbook photo.
How do you think I feel having to look at you?
What the fuck does he want?
The airport does not endorse solicitors.
Death is not the end.
It will be for you if you harass my students.
I have to ask you a few questions this evening.
Did you pack your bags yourself?
Have your belongings been in your possession the entire time?
Mr Browning?
Have you received any packages from persons unknown to you?
- What?
September 25.
Your birthday' s the same as your departure time.
George, Dad said both of us.
Give me some cash.
Knock it off.
- Thanks.
- You' re welcome.
Let' s go take a shit.
- No, dude.
We' re about to board a seven- hour flight.
The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets.
Say halfway through the flight... your body wants that aeroplane food out.
Then directly after you, walks in Christa or Blake.
Want them to associate you with that watery sting in their eye?
That reflexive gag at the back of their throat?
John Denver.
Died in a plane crash.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience.
At this time, we would like to begin preboarding... of Volée Air flight 180 to Paris through gate 46.
In the sky
Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock?
How did we lose him?
Go.
Go.
That hurt.
That' s a good sign.
It' d be a fucked- up God to take down this plane.
A really fucked- up God.
How you doing?
Can you switch seats with Christa?
God, I would, but I got a bladder thing.
It' s a urinary tract infection.
Let' s go ask Alex.
Could you trade seats so Blake and I could sit together?
She asked Tod, but he had some medical thing.
Please?
Thanks, Alex.
Thank you, Alex.
You really think we' d titty- fuck them over Greenland?
Because of you, I got to watch fucking "Stuart Little."
Thank you.
That' s my seat right there.
Could you trade seats so Blake and I could sit together?
She asked Tod, but he had some medical thing.
Please?
What' s up, dude?
- Is there a problem, sir?
- What' s your fucking problem?
This fucking plane' s going to explode!
- Shut up, Browning.
- You' re so not funny.
- If this is a joke...
- Sit down!
We' il remove you if this continues.
I' il fucking remove myself!
Everybody in the aisle off the plane.
This fucking plane is going down!
See how he' s doing.
No one gets back on board.
- That' s my call.
- Wait, please!
Please.
You must understand my position.
I do, and I apologize for Alex... but one of us needs to be on that plane.
I cannot let those students go to Paris for ten days...
One of you can go on the flight.
One of us can get back on.
The rest can take an 11. 10 flight.
I' il stay.
You know the French thing.
It' s fine.
Hi, I was in the bathroom, and the lock was stuck...
Wait, I didn' t fight with anyone!
Damn!
I called your parents.
They' re on their way.
Alex, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it on the runway, I saw it take off...
I saw out my window, I saw the ground.
And the cabin, it starts to shake.
The left side blows up and the whole plane explodes.
And it was so real, like how everything happens.
You fell asleep.
We get thrown off the plane and blow a half day in Paris?
The plane, it' s going to blow up!
Fuck you, Horton.
The only trip you' re taking is to the fucking hospital!
There they go, here we stay.
I wish you were on that plane!
- You fucking prick!
You' re looking at me as if I caused this.
I didn' t cause this.
Are there any survivors?
How should I know?
- You think I' m some...
- He' s not a witch.
I' m Howard Seigel...
National Transportation and Safety Board.
They are on the way.
Is there anyone here who feels they might need... medical attention or spiritual counselling?
What' s going on?
Are there any survivors?
The cause for the explosion is still undetermined.
The Nassau County authorities are on the scene... naval search and rescue en route.
I' m Agent Weine.
This is Agent Schreck.
We' re with the FBl.
I understand how you all must be feeling... and I know it' s going to be difficult... but we need to ask questions regarding today' s events... while they' re still fresh in your mind.
This will prove invaluable to our rescue attempts... and any potential criminal investigation.
"This plane will explode on takeoff."
How did you know that?
I got this feeling.
This weird feeling.
Did you take any sedatives before boarding?
On board, did you take any sleeping pills... narcotics, hallucinogens?
Do you take any drugs?
I saw it.
I saw it happen.
I saw the plane explode.
Did the weird feelings have anything to do... with your saying you wished Carter Horton was on it... just before it exploded?
Then why' d you say it?
I didn' t really think it was going to happen.
If that' s the case, Alex... why did you really get off the plane?
My brother George... he told me to go keep an eye on Alex.
And so he stayed and...
He told me to get off the plane.
Larry Murnau said I should get back on... but I told him that he should go.
I sent him back on the plane.
All right.
Nobody forced you off the plane.
You said you weren' t friends with those that were... so, Clear, why did you get off the plane?
Because I saw and I heard Alex...
and I believed him.
Thank you for the ride.
You are looking at the first piece of debris... to wash ashore from Volée Air flight 180... which erupted shortly after a 9. 25 p. m. takeoff... from John F. Kennedy Airport in New York.
There are no known survivors.
Coast Guard and naval search and rescue efforts... are continuing at this moment... even as jet fuel burns on the ocean' s surface.
Authorities are pessimistic about the possibility... of finding anyone alive from the ill- fated flight.
All 287 passengers are feared dead.
Amongst the travellers... a class of forty students and four teachers... from Mount Abraham High School in south- east New York... en route to Paris on a field trip.
There are reports several students... were removed from the aircraft moments before departure... however, investigators remain guarded... about the specifics of this incident.
Authorities from National Transportation and Safety... and the Federal Bureau of Investigation... have arrived at JFKto begin the initial investigation.
Eyewitnesses at the airport, as well as on Long Island... report seeing the plane explode.
At JFK, air traffic controllers... are corroborating these eyewitness accounts.
After the explosion, debris apparently rained... into the Atlantic Ocean for several miles.
Investigators are cautious about verifying these accounts... believing they' il learn more...
Thirty- nine days have passed... since we lost our thirty- nine loved ones... friends, and teachers.
As each day passes... without a determining cause for the accident... we ask ourselves, "Why?"
"Ecclesiastes" tells us...
"Man no more knows his own time...
"or birds trapped in the snare.
"when the time falls suddenly upon them."
And so, before we can heal... before we escape the presence of death and time... we must mourn and celebrate theirs... with this memorial.
I hope you don' t think because my name ain' t on this wall... that I owe you anything.
I don' t.
All I owe these people is to live my life to the fullest.
Why don' t you stay off the J. D., then?
Don' t you ever fucking tell me what to do.
I control my life, not you.
I' m never going to die.
I took my driver' s test last week at the DMV.
Got a seventy.
It' s the lowest score you can get, but I passed.
The thing is, when I was done with the test... you know the guy that drives with you during the test?
"Young man, you' re going to die at a very young age."
Is that true?
Not now, not here, not ever, Billy.
Fuck.
Don' t talk to me.
You scare the hell out of me.
I miss you, you know?
Yeah, I miss you, too.
But my father, he doesn' t understand.
Look, when he gets over this thing... you and me, we' il road trip to the city... catch the Yanks.
We' il do that.
Cool.
I better go.
This thing Ms Lewton showed me in class... they' re going to let me read it.
It says what I' m feeling.
Take care, man.
Because of you, I' m still alive.
Thank you.
We say that the hour of death cannot be forecast.
But when we say this... we imagine that the hour is placed... in an obscure and distant future.
It never occurs to us that it has any connection... with the day already begun... or that death could arrive this same afternoon.
This afternoon which is so certain... and which has every hour filled in advance.
What happened?
Where' s Tod?
Get out of here.
- What happened?
You caused Tod so much guilt over George... he took his own life.
He wouldn' t do that.
He said we' d be friends again after you got better.
Why would he make plans if he was going to kill himself?
Mr Waggner.
Almost autumn.
It' s only the end of June.
Yeah, but everything' s always in transition.
If you focus, even now, just one week into summer... you can almost feel autumn coming.
I like being able to see the future.
Why were you at Tod' s house last night?
I' ve seen enough TV to know... the FBl doesn' t investigate teen suicides.
That means, one... they still don' t have a clue what caused the crash.
Two... they haven' t ruled out anything... and the fact seven people got off the plane... is probably weird enough.
Not to mention, one of those people had a vision... of the plane exploding... minutes before it actually did is highly suspicious.
And it doesn' t help that the visionary' s friend... just committed suicide.
Why were you there last night?
You know what this is?
This is a...
This is Springy Head Guy.
It' s you.
Not a likeness.
It' s how you make me feel, Alex.
I' m sorry.
No.
Like you, the sculpture doesn' t even know... what or why it is.
It' s reluctant to take form... and yet creating an absolute... but incomprehensible attraction.
In four years of high school... we haven' t said one word to each other.
At that moment, on the plane, I felt what you felt.
I didn' t even know where those emotions came from... until you started freaking out.
I didn' t see what you saw, but I felt it.
You can still feel it, can' t you?
Something from that day is still with you.
I know because I can still feel you.
That' s why I was there last night.
I' ve never dealt with death before.
This could all be in our head.
It just feels like it' s all around us.
It?
What if Tod was just the first?
Of us.
Is that something that you' re feeling?
I don' t know.
I wish I could see him one last time.
Maybe I would know.
Then let' s go see him.
Easy.
Gives me a rush.
This place?
Doing something I' m not supposed to.
Come on.
Hurry up.
- Is that him?
- I think.
Why did they make him up like Michael Jackson?
That' s him.
Whatever it was that made him Tod is definitely gone.
Please.
You' il wake the dead.
Why' d his hand do that?
Chemicals.
Look, I' m his friend...
I know who you are.
What are all those tiny marks?
Cuticle lacerations from pulling at the wire.
Pulling at the wire?
If he was pulling at the wire, he didn' t kill himself.
It was an accident.
In death, there are no accidents... no coincidences, no mishaps... and no escapes.
What you have to realize is we' re all just a mouse... a cat has by the tail.
Every single move we make... from the mundane to the monumental... the red light that we stop at or run... the people we have sex with or won' t with us... aeroplanes that we ride or walk out of... it' s all part of death' s sadistic design...
leading to the grave.
Design.
Does that mean if... you figure out the design, you can cheat death?
Alex, you' ve already done that... by walking off the plane.
Your friend' s departure... shows that death has a new design for all of you.
Now you have to figure out... how and when it' s coming back at you.
Play your hunch... if you think you can get away with it.
But remember... the risk of cheating the plan... of disrespecting the design... could incite a fury to terrorize even the Grim Reaper.
And you don' t even want to fuck with that Mack Daddy.
Well...
I' m sorry we broke in, and...
No harm, no foul.
I' il see you soon.
The mortician said that death has a design.
I' m talking about omens.
How do we know, that just by sitting here... by sipping this coffee or breathing the air... or even crossing the intersection... we haven' t started in motion... the events that will some day lead to our death... forty years from now, ten years, tomorrow?
We don' t, unless we open ourselves up... to the signs it' s willing to show us.
I don' t understand.
Did you see Tod die?
Did it happen again, like on the plane?
No, it didn' t, but it might as well have.
This is a message from something, Clear... or someone, hinting at a design.
Total bullshit.
You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
Coffee starts with a "C" and ends with an "E".
So does "choke."
We' il choke to death?
I want to hear you... but we' il go nuts if you start with this shit.
The mortician said that death has a design, right?
Now, what if you, me, Tod, Carter...
Terry, Billy, Mrs Lewton messed up that design?
For whatever reason, I saw death' s plan... and we cheated it.
But what if it was our time?
What if we were not meant to get off that plane?
What if it still is our time?
If it is, then it' s not finished... and we will die.
Now, not later.
Unless we find the patterns and cheat it again.
After hearing you, I do believe... that Tod killed himself.
Baby, come on, not now.
Looks like we have a reunion here.
Let it go.
- When are you moving?
- Couple weeks.
- That' s too bad.
Losing our favourite teacher.
Guys, there' s something I need to tell you.
We' re in danger!
Enough!
Both of you!
They died, and we lived.
Get over it.
I will not let this plane crash... be the most important thing in my life!
I' m moving on, Carter... and if you want to waste your life... beating the shit out of Alex every time you see him... then you can just drop fucking dead!
Is Alex there?
Hi, Clear.
Yeah, just a minute.
You want to talk to her?
Clear, he' s in the shower.
Sure.
She' s concerned about you.
I' m concerned about you.
Why won' t you talk to her?
Or to me?
Dad, you and Mom have both been a big help... but there' s something I need to understand... before I can talk.
The National Transportation Safety Board... has a new theory tonight on the cause of the explosion... of Volée Air flight 180.
Officials believe deterioration of silicone insulation... on an electrical connector to the scavenger pump... may have leaked combustible fluids.
A spark beneath the coach cabin in the fuselage... may have ignited the fuel line, proceeding to the fuel pump... which would have set off the catastrophic explosion.
The path of the explosion.
First was Tod, then it was Terry.
They' re dying in the order they would' ve died.
That' s death' s design.
Ms Lewton' s next.
Whenever I can fall asleep, I see Terry Chaney... and in the day, out of nowhere...
I hear the sound of my own voice in my head... saying to Larry Murnau...
You know the whole French thing.
"Get on the plane."
Everything reminds me of that day.
I' m hoping a change will help.
I lived here my whole life, you know?
And everywhere I looked were great memories.
And now all I see is Larry and those kids.
Just looking out my own front yard... makes me feel nothing but fear.
Laura, I' m going to have to call you back.
Right.
This is Valerie Lewton.
I need Agent Schreck.
What are you doing here?
I was just... checking the air in the tyre to make sure it' s safe.
Get in the car.
Put on your seat belt.
I believe that... that Ms Lewton is next.
Next?
Yeah, next, because... there' s this pattern that' s occurring.
Right.
A pattern.
You noticed that, too?
Mom' s favourite.
So what about this pattern?
Did you see it in one of your visions?
Did you catch it in some TV static?
I never asked for what happened on the plane.
Whatever.
It' s fine.
Six lives, and everybody in my entire school... thinks I' m a freak.
I' m not suffering from post- traumatic stress.
I don' t have a narcissistic deity complex.
I' m not going Dahmer on you guys.
This just is.
There is a pattern for us all.
There is a pattern for you.
There is a design for everyone, and I don' t know how yet... but I' m going to break this one.
You came to our attention... because you were under suspicion in this plane explosion.
I know you didn' t blow up the plane.
We were ready to move on... but then the other survivors started to die.
First, your friend Tod... then Terry Chaney, while you were at the scene.
And tonight, we pick you up at Val Lewton' s house.
Nobody has control over life and death... unless they are taking lives and causing death.
Can you promise me no one else is going to die?
No, I can' t.
I' m sorry.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
That kid gives me the creeps.
We got nothing.
That' s not what I' m talking about.
There were a couple of moments... where I almost believed him.
Don' t take this the wrong way... but sometimes you give me the creeps.
You' ve got to stop this.
It' s a stupid mug.
Pretty soon you' il be gone.
You' il be gone.
All right, just stay still, OK?
I don' t know where he is.
He' s not talking to me.
Why?
Because I didn' t believe him.
If he does contact you, I think it would be... in the best interest of your safety if you called us.
Now, here' s my card.
Toll- free number.
Interesting work.
Carter, you dick!
What are you doing?
Terry should be on this wall.
Shit.
Why' d you want us to meet you here?
They' re watching me to see if I go to Alex.
That' s why you' re taking me.
Why would I want to see him?
Because he knows which one of us is next.
Drive the speed limit, OK?
And don' t pass on the right.
I' m getting a vision.
You' re the next one, man.
Man, why' d you say that?
Because if you say another word, I' il fucking kill you.
He could be anywhere from here to a mile down the road... so you guys start that way and meet back in the middle.
It' il take half the time.
Do you think they' re still up there?
Somehow, flight 180, are they still in flight?
Somewhere... are they safe?
When I was a kid, like six or seven...
I used to worry so much about my parents dying.
Lying awake at night, just worrying.
Most kids do, I guess.
Most kids never have it happen.
When I was ten... my dad went into a 7- Eleven for cigarettes.
He heard someone say, "Don' t turn around."
On reflex, or thinking it was a friend joking, he did.
A guy blew his head off.
Life became shit after that.
My mom couldn' t deal anymore.
She married this asshole who my mom with my real dad... would have crossed the street to avoid this guy.
He didn' t really want a kid... so my mom didn' t, either, anymore.
If that was the design for my father and family... then fuck death!
God, I have thought a lot about that somewhere.
It exists, that place... where my dad is safe.
Where he had a full pack of cigarettes and kept driving.
Where me and my mom and my dad are still together... and have no idea about this life here.
Where our friends are still in the sky.
Where everyone gets a second chance.
Alex, we can' t give up.
I can' t go home, because after Mrs Lewton... they' re looking for me.
It' s a couple of miles from my house.
Browning, you fucking warlock... did you hear about Ms Lewton or what?
Why do you think I was hiding?
Billy told the FBl he saw you running from her house.
I was running 'cause they blame me for everything.
They blame me for Tod, for her... for the fucking plane crash.
The fire caramelized her blood.
Your shoe prints were in it, your fingerprints on the knives.
I told you they were not...
I' m not talking about if you did it.
Or even if you knew she was dead.
Did you know she was going to be next before she was?
Yeah, I did.
I knew.
All right, out of us... who' s next to see it?
Please... tell me I' m going to see the Jets win a Super Bowl.
It' s me, right?
That' s why you' re not saying.
I should have felt up Tammy in the pool that time.
What are you whining about?
He didn' t say anything.
Just drive.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
Think it' s easier to know?
It' s fucking harder.
You get off having control over me?
Let me decide how to deal with it.
It doesn' t matter who' s next...
'cause we' re all on the same list.
Fuck.
Really?
Then why bother?
Me and Terry' il be back together on the other side... so why wait any longer?
What are you doing?
Carter, slow down.
- Slow down, Carter!
Knock it off!
May as well go out on my own free will!
Not with us in the fucking car!
Jesus, Carter!
Carter, stop the car!
What' s the fucking worry if it ain' t your time?
You all wouldn' t get shit.
It doesn' t work that way!
I fucking hated French class!
- That' s what I' m doing!
I know what you' re doing, and it' s all right to be scared.
I' m not afraid.
I control my death.
You don' t have to prove how big your balls are!
What are you doing?
- Carter, stop!
- Back on the wheel!
Shit.
Carter, easy.
I am so close to puking right now.
We' re afraid, too, but we' re not quitting.
Stop it and stop this fucking car!
Damn it, I want you to stop this car right now!
- Move it.
- Open the door, Billy.
Move the fucking car!
- Open the fucking door.
- Move the car.
- Open the fucking door.
Carter, listen to me.
Don' t do this.
God damn it!
Get out of the fucking car!
Carter, listen to me!
It' s not the way!
Get out of the car!
It' s coming!
It ain' t my time.
Shit.
Listen to me!
This isn' t the way.
Get out of the car!
Get out!
I can' t get out!
Man, he really is next.
Get out!
Oh, God!
I saw it!
I saw the belt!
You scared now?
It broke!
Bullshit!
He saved your life again.
That' s right!
You' re next, Carter!
I' m staying the fuck away from you!
- Shut up, Billy!
- We don' t need this shit now.
I don' t need it ever!
Get away from him!
He' s next!
You will be.
You' re dead... and you ain' t taking me with you!
That' s the plan!
That' s the design!
You should be fucking dead!
You' re the devil!
I saw the seat belt.
I knew it would rip!
That' s how I saved him.
I saw it!
- The police are coming.
I saved him!
Because I saved him, it skipped Carter... and went to the next person in the path of the explosion!
I have to see it.
Then I intervene... and if I intervene, I cheat the design.
Intervene?
Are you God now?
God' s not afraid to die.
Gods don' t die!
We do!
Baby, you are losing it.
The police will be here.
We have to get you back to my cabin.
You can hide out and get your head together.
After Billy, I' m next.
I' m next.
Then me.
Listen to me.
Why don' t you two get the fuck out of here?
Rusted.
Tetanus.
Nice one.
I overlooked it.
You tried to capitalize, but I caught you.
You fuck!
I can beat you.
Maybe not forever... but I got this cabin rigged to beat you now!
She was there a minute ago.
What are you talking about?
I' m not turning him in.
It' s too dangerous for him out there alone.
I go with you.
You can' t.
Just tell us where he is.
Wait at home.
I give you my word... we will bring him in safely in protective custody.
I never moved.
I would have been up next to Tod.
Why didn' t I remember that?
I never moved.
Clear' s seat was in front of mine.
She' s next.
Get in the car!
We' re going around!
- There!
- Come on, let' s go!
Alex, we' re trying to help you.
Prince!
Get away from it!
Run!
We lost him.
No shit.
Stay there!
Don' t move!
Don' t touch anything.
You' re grounded by the tyres.
The car' s going to explode!
You know what to do.
Don' t!
When I do this, it' il skip you, and it' il all be over.
It' s the only way we can cheat death again.
Don' t!
I am not going to let it beat us both.
You know what to do!
I' il always be with you.
Get away from there!
Damn it!
You can' t do this to me.
Come on.
Shit, he' s not breathing.
Come on.
Well, we made it.
Paris.
I can' t believe it.
Know what I' m saying?
It' s weird being here, huh?
We finally completed a puzzle.
You know?
To Terry.
And to Tod.
To all of our friends that can' t be here.
Cheers.
What?
If you would' ve told me six months ago... the three of us would be sitting here having a drink...
Sometimes it feels like... you two are the only ones who understand.
You were right, Browning.
It did skip us.
There was a design.
We beat it.
We won.
The only thing we won is a chance at a full life.
A chance that I won' t ever waste.
There' s just something I can' t figure out.
- About what?
- The design.
Just let it go, all right?
Hear me out, all right?
- Just listen.
The explosion path determined the order of our deaths.
When I intervened and saved Carter... it skipped him and went to the next person... Billy.
Then it was Clear.
But I intervened and saved her, so it went to me.
But in my case, no one intervened, right?
I was thrown from that power line... by the explosion, so...
So why did it skip you?
How do we know this isn' t what was meant to happen?
That out of everyone on flight 180... you, me, and Carter were meant to live?
Maybe that was the design all along.
- Or you could still be next.
- Shut up, Carter.
I didn' t make up the rules.
Somebody' s got to intervene before death can skip them.
Alex proved that three times with the plane, me, and you.
For all I know, it could circle back... and get us all again.
But I am the safest fucker in the world... because you' re still next.
Let' s figure out...
I' il meet you back at the hotel.
I' il go with you.
No, just stay here, OK, Clear?
It' s true.
I told you you were next, man.
Stop it, Carter.
Alex, wait.
Clear, stay there, OK?
Stay away.
- I told you you were next!
Don' t get me wrong, but it always gets so... complicated.
Yesterday I went to grab a beer at a costumeparty.
I wanted to get to bed early.
I ended up having a few too many, but at least I got to bed early.
ln a sense.
My name is Jacob, by the way.
I' m the one on the bottom.
The girl on top is called...
Hey.
Hello?
- I don' t even know your name.
Excuse me...
I know had something to do to day.
I was supposed to be... in church.
At a christening.
My niece' s!
Shit!
I' m supposed to be her godfather!
I' m supposed to be at a christening.
I' m sorry, but women are lousy at handling rejection.
It' s about being responsible.
I am a lawyer, after all.
- Aren' t we going inside?
- We did.
And came back out.
- Was there a fire drill?
- We' re done.
It started at ten.
No godfather in the picture?
Her godfather is in the picture.
These are my best friends.
Tonje is my sister.
Deep inside, I think she likes me.
Her next baby is already due.
Nine months and 15 minutes after Stine.
Fredrik doesn' t mind.
He thinks everything Tonje says is fine.
Fredrik is the perfect family man.
Veronica is a butterfly who brightens up wherever she lands.
Lately she' s been landing on me.
I have to remind her that we' re just friends.
John is my best friend.
He may be blind, but he' s the most clearsighted of us all.
And he' s Stine' s godfather.
Anne' s dream is to find a partner.
Her odds have increased greatly since she came out of the closet.
Sorry, Fredrik.
I' m serious.
- I got lost.
- You' re unbelievable.
I won' t even ask what her name was.
A little big?
At least it' s better than that rabbit suit.
Don' t you look nice, Jacob.
A little 1980s retro?
- What' s the matter with you?
- I hurt my back.
Is nothing sacred to you, Jacob?
- I had planned...
- A godfather supports and guides.
Take a walk and calm her down.
Any hot chicks here?
Hi.
- Good?
- It' s a little dry.
- Do you have children?
- No.
You view them as a reproduction of your own self- complacency?
I have yet to find the woman I want to have them with.
Some may say that' s a little premature.
These aren' t my condoms.
I' ve just borrowed the suit.
- Want me to take her?
- No, I' m fine.
Who is that?
You don' t have to sleep with every woman you meet, you know.
I don' t believe in any "woman of my life."
The only ones who have succeeded at that, are you and Tonje.
Hi, Jacob Sand.
That was the Minister of Commerce from Cameroon.
- Does your back hurt?
- I just... fell out of bed.
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Did you read about that guy who hit his leg?
He ended up with gangrene.
- Gangrene?
- He had to amputate his leg.
He hasn' t said a word since.
- 240 kroner.
- I can just get off here.
Hello, hello, hello?
Aren' t you going to invite me up?
I am so incredibly tired.
I have had the day from hell.
And I would just make it worse?
Veronica...
Would you like to come up?
Veronica...
- I' ve started playing the sax.
- I thought you played guitar.
No, guitar is so...
But sax is raw and sexy.
Turn off that music!
- What about mountain climbing?
- That wasn' t for me.
But the sax is cool.
Am I totally hopeless?
You aren' t hopeless.
Hi, Ahmed.
Sorry I' m so late.
Hey, it worked out.
You are serious?
You kidding!
- No, the fax came in today.
- And they can all come to Norway?
I cannot believe it!
Careful.
I hurt my back.
Sit down.
I know doctor.
This be very good.
Fix everything.
You call.
Say hello from me.
I' il call.
See you later.
Jacob?
I have sister.
- Later, Ahmed.
- Tomorrow.
- Later!
- OK, later.
- It seemed bigger.
- Are the rising mains new or old?
I didn' t ask.
I just asked if there were rising mains.
This is so boring!
One sure sign that you' re getting older, -
- is that you go to more open houses than bars.
They' ve got a house and a kid.
All they' re missing is a Saab station wagon.
They have a Saab station wagon.
- Jacob!
- Maria?
Fred, this is my... ex- boyfriend, Jacob.
- Fred.
- Jacob.
Jacob?
You' re the one with warts on your feet.
That didn' t dare operate.
You always slept with your socks on.
I see you haven' t changed.
I am very happy.
We are buying a house.
And you?
I met a mother of four.
We live in a big house with apple trees -
- and kids running around drinking juice.
Like a classical painting.
You haven' t matured at all.
We are leaving.
Vamos!
Cool uniform.
Jacob Sand?
Dr. Bomann can see you now.
- Your back?
- Yes.
Many suffer from that.
You are in good hands now.
Jacob Sand is here.
Nice to see you again.
Likewise.
Hey...
I' m sorry about that Commerce Minister.
I hope you didn' t...
- Does your back hurt?
- What?
Yes, down here.
Take your coat off, and I' il have a look.
There...
Pull your shirt up, so I can feel.
Did you twist it somehow, or did it just happen?
I was lying down...
And then I fell.
You fell while lying down?
Yes.
Legs together.
Can you bend forward?
- That hurts.
- Yes, a little bit.
- You disappeared from the party.
- I was just there as an interpreter.
- Lift your arms.
- You speak Cameroonian?
I speak one of 250 Cameroonian dialects.
Lift your leg.
And now the other leg.
There.
That' s that.
Are we done?
It' s only muscular.
You' il be better in a few days.
Aren' t you going to take any...
No tests, nothing?
Not for your back.
But if you have anything else...
I have been feeling listless lately.
Do you have to take so many tests?
We' ve checked your heart, kidneys, blood pressure, and lungs.
Are you all right?
I had forgotten why I never go to the doctor.
I took a urine sample.
I thought we could test your sperm.
Test my sperm?
What if you meet the love of your life?
You can tell her you have top- notch sperm.
You mean I have to...?
Do you sell houses?
- How does that apply to my sperm?
- It doesn' t.
But you' re a lawyer.
I work primarily with asylum seekers.
Immigration law.
That' s right.
Too bad.
I' m considering selling mine.
Oh, you mean real estate!
Yes, that I do!
If you mean...
Is it a wooden house?
Stone?
I do stone houses.
All kinds of real estate, actually.
You' il need this.
- Is it serious?
- Only if you fail to sell it.
Here' s my address.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I' m going out to dinner afterward.
Come in.
There.
Let' s see...
Here is the sitting room.
I thought we could start with the first floor.
- I see you work in the public sector.
- This was dad' s childhood home.
Here is the sitting room, and pantry and kitchen.
- Are your parents alive?
- Almost too much.
Dad just got a motorcycle, mom got a lover in Crete.
Good genes, I see.
No nutcases or perverts?
I have an uncle who' s a band leader.
That isn' t lethal.
It is for your social life....
This should be an easy sell.
Here is the small library, the guest bathroom...
- When are you selling?
- As soon as possible.
There is a bedroom, guest room...
And if we continue over here...
Hello?
Do you have kids?
This is my room.
- Is this yours?
- Yes.
This is where I grew up.
I had that same dollhouse.
My mother had this weird notion:
Girls had to play with cars and boys had to play with dolls.
So I had that same dollhouse.
But what have you done?
This isn' t...
- You know that' s the kitchen?
- Yes.
What is that double bed doing in there?
That' s the kitchen.
They' re sleeping in the kitchen.
So they can be next door to the baby.
My point is that you have too many kids.
You have five kids.
This is a mink' s nest.
You' ve squeezed in kids all over.
- There are five siblings.
That' s too many.
You have to have five.
The playroom is up here.
But they sleep down here.
The baby can get colicky.
He sleeps alone, so he doesn' t wake the others.
You actually live in here.
Let' s continue.
Then we went into her room.
It was so...
Magical.
Yes, but John...
She' s stunning!
She' s your client.
I' m her patient.
I thought you feared doctors.
I' ve never met a woman like this who immediately...
- Jacob...
- Yes?
- Are you going back to her house?
Why?
I' m going with you.
You can' t do this on your own.
Of course I can.
I' m a specialist in property law.
You don' t understand this.
- I shouldn' t have mentioned her.
- It' s about understanding people.
It' s about selling.
John, you' re blind.
Jacob, you' re prejudiced.
I can always call her my self.
Remember what we agreed on?
I won' t speak until spoken to.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I brought John.
Thought it would be good to get his opinion.
As far as the sales strategy goes, and how to prepare...
That' s nice.
Come in.
- Nina.
- John.
I' ve heard so much about you.
I' ve been telling him about the house.
John has vast experience... with houses like this.
Beautiful.
Let' s start with the first floor.
Are you aware that Jacob is head over heels in love with you?
He didn' t dare come alone.
You may be his dream woman.
- I' ve never seen him like this.
- How was he before?
He tended to bring out strong maternal feelings in women.
- I can imagine.
- You underestimate yourself, Jacob.
Behind that pretty face lie vast amounts of hidden philosophy.
He has wanted to ask you something, but hasn' t dared.
He wants to ask you out on a date.
OK...
I' il call you.
This went great, Jacob.
Nothing to worry about at all.
I hate the saxophone!
I hate Jan Gar- fucking- barek!
What happened?
I feel like a satellite dish sucking in signals.
- Why doesn' t anyone want me?
- Plenty of people want you.
You don' t.
You just sleep with me.
Hey...
Maybe we should stop doing that.
Have you met someone else?
Why do you ask?
Why else would you stop sleeping with me?
It' s just inevitable that one of us will get hurt.
You have met someone else.
Veronica...
Why make all these demands that we can never fulfil, Jacob?
Imagine if we could just... be, and be satisfied with that.
Imagine how wonderful that would be.
Turn off that music!
You owe me a new broom!
Cheers!
- Happy birthday, John.
- Thank you for coming.
- Hello?
What' s this?
- A present from me.
You' re so sweet.
Glasses!
Look at those!
Are they nice?
Plenty of room for your nose.
Cheers!
Dear John, happy birthday.
Marte and I, we...
We have some news as our present for you.
We are getting married.
- Married?
- Congratulations!
- When?
- In August.
- That' s wonderful!
- But you' ve only just met.
- And now you' re getting married?
- Yes.
I just think it' s a little early.
- Only three of us left.
- Don' t look at me.
- What about you, Jacob?
- Jacob will search till he' s 100.
No, Jacob has been showing an interest in female doctors lately.
- With his fear of doctors?
- He has a new "family doctor."
Sometimes I wonder what you think with.
Now what?
What do you think?
- Are you doing Veronica?
- We' re just good friends.
You don' t sleep with your friends!
Thank you, John.
You may want to straighten out your social antennas a little bit.
Sorry.
Veronica will be fine.
So will you.
I' m more concerned about Tonje and Fredrik.
At least, they have the paperwork.
But they' re planning to... buy a house and have another kid.
- Heard anything from Nina?
- Thought I' d send her an e- mail.
What are you going to write?
That I think about her all the time.
- Is that wrong?
- No.
No, Jacob.
That' s just fine.
- Why didn' t you say anything?
- Why should I say anything?
You' re supposed to tell me things like that.
She feels I lack ambition.
You aren' t staying home forever.
The problem is, I don' t know what I want.
I don' t want to be a career lawyer like Tonje.
You don' t have to work as a lawyer.
I am a fourth generation Supreme Court advocate.
I want to write books.
Be an author.
So write books.
I' ve already submitted one to a publisher.
- But writing isn' t a real job.
- Is that what Tonje says?
Not in words.
Hello?
Hi.
Now?
I can be there in ten minutes.
That was the doctor' s office.
My test results are in.
They want me there.
Jacob Sand is here.
Hi.
What is it?
Won' t you have a seat?
Is something wrong?
Jacob...
You are fine.
There was nothing wrong with your tests.
- I' m sorry.
- That' s OK.
I just wanted to see you again.
I have the rest of the day off.
- Want to do something?
- I' d love to.
Let' s go in here.
Here?
A karaoke bar?
Want a beer?
Two beers.
I think this one should be good...
Good morning.
Sleep well?
- Are you already up?
- I have to go shopping.
- I need to find a children' s store.
- Why?
Is that so strange?
You haven' t asked if I use birth control.
Hey...
Are you...?
Do you know...?
Isn' t that what you want?
A colleague just had a baby.
Jacob!
Have you ever seen anything so tiny?
Or so expensive?
It costs a fortune.
- Don' t you like children?
- Why do you ask?
- It doesn' t seem like it.
- I' m crazy about kids.
I' m serious.
Why wait?
Because we' ve only known eachother for a month.
So?
I' ve found the man of my life.
I have a good education, a good job, a good income.
Now I want a baby.
Do we have time to eat first?
When is a good time?
More women now use foreign sperm banks to become pregnant.
Hello?
Here.
- Can you baby- sit tonight?
- Me?
We' ve been invited to a gala and our babysitter backed out.
I promised to help John get Anne' s wedding present.
You are... were almost her godfather.
I don' t know the first thing about kids.
This is the front, this is the back.
Instructions are under her feet.
Can' t anyone else?
I' ve called everyone but the Salvation Army.
- I can call them.
- You owe me.
- Hi.
- Can you baby- sit?
Come in.
Are you sure?
I' d love to do it my self.
If you have plans, you have plans.
Hello?
Yes.
- Can you hold her for a second?
- I' m on my way.
Ten minutes.
- I' m sorry.
- Go.
Leave us girls alone.
Are you sure it' s all right?
I won' t be late.
Is anything happening?
- Don' t scare them.
- I' m not.
- Getting any?
- They' re just eating.
- You said they' d go to sleep.
- They will.
There' s enough sleeping medicine in that bread to knock out Duckburg.
- Why are you so late?
- You take over.
I' m bored.
- Can' t we just buy a present?
- You know Anne loves duck.
To eat.
She may not want them as pets.
- There' s none left.
- So knock their heads against a tree.
How are things going, Jacob?
How' s it going with the woman of your life?
Great.
I' ve never been so in love before.
This is the first time...
- What' s going on?
- I don' t know.
- Hello?
- Yoga.
To counteract stress.
Veronica, if it gets too bad, you can just marry me.
What' s going on here?
Don' t tell me you' ve hypnotized them to lie like that.
Bring the car down to the river.
Well done, Jacob!
Nice of you to show up.
Don' t say anything.
It would just sound stupid.
I' m going to bed.
Good night.
Hi, this is Nina Bomann.
Leave a message after the tone.
Nina?
Nina?
I' m so sorry about what happened yesterday.
It has nothing to do with that, Jacob.
Please.
What is it?
This just won' t work.
What won' t work?
We want different things out of life, Jacob.
I want you.
We can have kids.
I' m serious.
I' m having you arrested!
That' il teach you!
Have you talked to her?
Are you really in love with her?
John...
If you are, it doesn' t matter what she said.
She broke up with me.
- Those are just words.
- Words?
You have to fight!
Show her she' s special.
Buy a full- page ad, buy a flower shop, go on a hunger strike.
Do something active.
Dare something!
Jacob, for the first time in your life you' re in love.
- You can' t come in here.
- I want to see Nina.
- She quit last Friday.
- You expect me to believe that?
Sorry...
Happy?
Did she leave a forwarding address?
You know that information is confidential.
Hello?
You moved some things for Nina Bomann.
Finally, there you are!
This will be a fun starting point...
We thought you had changed your mind.
I' m Auntie Crazy.
Don' t take that literally.
What' s your sign?
- Virgo.
- Expect me to believe that?
Well, we have a job to do!
Entré!
You can undress over there to the right.
Undress?
We are all too inhibited.
Hung up in conventions, in squares.
We have to let go.
We must.
Let go!
My first orgasm was incredible.
Do you masturbate often?
You should.
Let' s see.
How do you like to pose?
Frontal, or from the rear?
Whatever you prefer.
I' m here to talk to Nina.
You' re Jacob.
Then we want a poem.
Recite a poem.
- A poem?
- A poem.
Let it out.
Release the poem, Jacob.
About the woman you love.
She' s like a boat on the ocean.
Her head is full of notions.
Her heart, warm with emotion.
For how things should be.
Why are you staring at me?
- This is bullshit!
- Wait.
Is Nina here?
- Do you know where she is?
- I can' t tell you.
Why can' t I talk to her?
Have I done something wrong?
She' s pregnant.
- Maybe she needs time to think.
- Why would she need that?
Maybe the thought of you as a father, frightens her.
She can' t just run away.
I didn' t think you wanted kids.
Relax, Jacob.
She' il be back.
- Now it' s Anne' s turn to get married.
- Hurrah!
I ask you, Marte Sundt Bull:
Do you take Anne Grom to be your lawful partner?
I do.
Do you, Anne Grom, take Marte Sundt Bull to be your lawful partner?
I do.
Since you have agreed to enter into a partnership, -
- I pronounce this partnership lawfully registered.
Go ahead.
Hi!
How are you doing?
I' m completely...
I' m completely out of it.
It' il all work out.
When you come home, I' m sure she' il be back.
What happened with you and me...
I feel very guilty.
I am so sorry.
You know that.
Who knows?
Maybe I' m finally open for the man of my life.
You deserve it.
This is the craziest wedding I have ever been to.
To you this must be a veritable orgy.
Why does everyone say that?
Because you have become a boring, predictable, -
- self- centered and self- righteous cunt of a lawyer!
I' m going to be a mommy.
And I' il be a mother.
- Next time I' il be mommy.
- And I' il be mother.
What about the father?
I' m sure he' d be as thrilled as us, if he only knew!
She' s a lesbian!
Most of the women here are.
Nina!
She knew I was a lawyer, asked me about my family, -
- had me take tests, checked for diseases...
That' s why she wanted to test my sperm!
She drained me like a billy goat!
Jacob, this is crazy.
She used me like a bull.
I might as well have given it to her in a cup.
- I want custody.
- Takes more than buying clothes.
- I can take classes.
- You plan to breast feed?
There is something called infant formula.
Jacob...
What makes you think the baby will be better off with you?
I don' t want the baby to grow up with a...
With a mother like that.
OK.
How warm is the formula supposed to be?
I can learn!
Is it supposed to look like that?
Did you think she ate with a knife and fork?
There you go.
Now let' s burp.
Come to daddy.
Can you hold her?
- Is she supposed to smell like this?
That' s the sixth time today.
Did you go poopie again?
Hold this.
- Where are you going?
- To buy diapers.
Now?
If she keeps crying, just thump her on the floor.
No wonder you were so upset.
Your diaper was full of poop.
What kind of daddy do you have?
Tonje and I went to see a marriage counselor.
The counselor talked about openness and communication.
What happened?
What do you think?
We started arguing.
- Eventually she left.
- Tonje?
No.
The counselor.
- Then what happened?
- We went home too.
And when we got home things were... so quiet.
Stine was at my mother' s.
It' s crazy.
I hardly recognize her.
She has gone through such a change.
All we do is...
- Tonje?
- Oh yes!
Are you happy now?
You don' t think I know about that lesbo stuff?
- You' il make a great family!
- What are you talking about?
I' ve seen what you' re up to.
You can' t fool me!
This is Petter.
I don' t think you' ve met.
- He' s my ex- husband.
- How are you doing?
- I' m doing fucking great!
I had planned to tell you.
I just needed some time to decide what to do.
You needed some time?
What about my rights?
The baby isn' t yours.
Can I come in?
- What happened to Uniform Boy?
- We broke up.
He could never love me.
All I want is a life.
Why can' t I get a life?
- Why did we break up?
- Because you left me.
- You made me leave.
- I did?
- You did not love me.
- Sure I did.
You never said so.
And you had stopped touching me.
- I didn' t think you wanted me to.
- There was nothing I wanted more.
Then why did you sleep on the couch?
Dearest Jacob...
If only you knew how much I loved you.
We could have been so happy.
Could have had a big family.
- What is this?
- I thought I was going to be a dad.
You don' t want children with me, -
- but as soon as you meet someone else, you make her pregnant?
I was tricked.
I thought I was tricked.
Oh, Jacob...
You always let yourself be used.
You have to learn to set limits.
We can have children!
Turn down that music!
Why did you sleep out here?
I' ve been thinking.
Let' s try again.
I can move in, and we can fix up this place together.
It will be fantástico!
This couch... has to go.
Hi.
Can we talk?
I came to apologize.
I had hoped you' d find out some other way.
- I' m the one that should apologize.
- No.
I should.
If you still think I' m in love with my aunt...
If I had known I was pregnant, -
- I never would have gotten involved with you like that.
I miss you.
Are you coming?
Nina?
Nina!
- It isn' t what you think.
- What is it?
She' s my ex.
She just became single.
That' s why she' s walking around naked in your apartment?
- What about your ex?
- Petter?
I wouldn' t touch him with a ten foot pole!
We want nothing to do with each other.
We had just signed our divorce papers.
Nina...
There must be something I can do.
- I' ve never felt this way before.
- We had our chance.
- I simply cannot decide.
- We don' t have much time.
Did you ask about the rising mains?
- She couldn' t find them.
- Couldn' t find the rising mains?
Don' t yell at me!
She' s the specialist.
- Have you heard from her, Jacob?
- No.
She' s having a baby with another man.
Maybe she' il come back to you.
Why would she do that?
Because she loves you.
That was beautifully put, Veronica.
What?
That was incredibly beautiful.
- Will you marry me?
- Let' s go.
I know I' m an arrogant bastard, but...
I love you.
I know.
It' s so obvious.
I must have been blind not to see it.
You' re the woman of my life.
You' re who I dream of.
John...
Veronica, will you marry me?
Will you marry me?
Yes.
Of course.
I' ve never understood why women like to look at baby clothes.
But now I think it' s... great.
Why do you think she came to you?
Why did she react like that when she saw Maria?
She wants you back.
I screwed up.
I know when it' s over.
You know nothing.
You have to fight.
She wants you to show yourself as the man she hopes you are.
I' m lost.
That' s the problem.
You aren' t.
Just don' t give up.
I heard rumors that you hung your lawyer' s robe in the closet.
Watch out for the curb.
Fredrik and I made a deal.
He can write, -
- and I turned down the partnership in my firm.
Great.
I thought that was what you wanted.
I wanted more Fredrik and he wanted more of me.
Did you know he wrote a novel while Stine slept?
Of course.
How' s the yoga going?
- Quit?
What are you doing now?
Nothing.
It' s enough to share a bottle of wine with John.
The water broke.
Get me to the hospital.
- Now?
- Yes.
Find a car!
A taxi!
- I' il get Fredrik.
- We don' t have time!
Get a taxi!
They won' t stop!
This woman is having a baby.
Can you drive her to the nearest clinic?
I' m a little busy right now.
Hurry!
- Is it real important?
- Hurry up, guys.
I hate to be difficult, but...
Go!
Can' t you go any faster?
This is fun!
My day just took a turn for the better.
Careful!
- Can' t you slow down a little?
- Try to wait.
I can' t exactly hold it in!
Careful with that wreath.
Someone' s supposed to mourn over it later.
Oh my god!
Drive!
I' ve dreamt of doing this for over ten years.
You' re on the sidewalk.
You see him, right?
I had a whole funeral procession behind me.
I must have lost them.
They know where to go.
You' re at the wrong entrance.
Good luck.
Thanks for the ride.
Now I need to find Nordberg Chapel from here.
Where might that be?
- Fredrik isn' t answering.
- Then leave a message!
- Where are you going?
- I...
You can' t leave now.
This will go just fine.
Breathe deeply, like you did at childbirth class.
Come over here.
Breathe easy.
And push!
Great!
Come on.
We' il let you cut the umbilical cord.
Come on!
Here it is!
Hi.
There' s our hero.
I never would have believed it.
Want to hold him?
My God, he' s so tiny.
Jacob...
We were wondering if you wanted to be godfather.
Everyone deserves a second chance.
Even you.
My boy!
Welcome, amigo!
You not know how happy I was.
My golly, how happy I was!
Uncle Pablo.
You remember him.
And Juan!
And you remember grandma.
The whole family is so happy.
Let the boy breathe, grandma.
We fix up apartment for you.
Total apartment.
Daddy has always loved you.
Come, sit!
Enjoy, enjoy, look at everything.
Let me hear what I want to hear.
When is it?
When is wedding?
Isn' t that the plan?
I fix everything.
To da la familia fix.
Make apartment nice for wedding.
You move in together.
No.
You kidding with me.
- No.
- You not kidding.
You have wedding.
You live together.
- Have grandchildren.
- No!
- Yes!
- No!
- You move in together!
- No!
I don' t love Maria.
It' s too big.
We don' t need this many bedrooms.
- What the hell is a rising main?
- I have no clue!
But it' s supposed to be important to ask about it.
You can' t sell this!
This house is you.
You' re to live here.
Have kids here.
What happened to you?
I had a discussion with the father...
- There must be something...
- Jacob!
Nina, I just came by because I wanted to see you today.
I love you.
I think about you all the time.
I want to see you today.
I want to see you tomorrow.
I want to see you every day, for the rest of my life.
Come here.
On one condition.
That we can have four kids.
I can even go along with five.
I want to be woken up at night.
Com fort them when they cry.
You know it isn' t yours.
I know that.
But I' m still here.
- You can' t even touch a diaper.
- Well, you can handle that part.
Come here...
Jacob?
I love you.
I love you too.
- Can I sleep in here?
- Are you up?
- I can' t sleep.
- Lie down next to daddy.
- I can' t sleep.
- Vilde was just crying.
Lie down here.
Tomorrow you can bring all your friends too.
Careful...
There.
- Jacob?
- Have I forgotten someone?
Maybe.
I' m pregnant.
I want a sister!

Very good.
Proceed.
Well...... I slipped...... on a thermal transfer this morning.
It' s never happened before.
I wasn' t concentrating enough.
Yes, I understand.
Things haven' t been...
-... going well.
- Yes, fine.
How could I be so wrong?
My mate...... has been acting very strange.
I can' t explain it.
- Yes.
- I haven' t been feeling very well myself.
- Yes, I understand.
- I don' t know, maybe it' s me.
Yes, fine.
I needed some pinural last night.
- I feel as if something...
- Excellent.... odd were happening to me.
- Something that...
- Yes? -... I can' t understand.
- Could you be more...... specific?
The sedatives.
I' m taking etracene, but it doesn' t seem strong enough.
I have a hard time concentrating.
You are a true believer.
Blessings of the state.
- Please, forgive me.
- Blessings of the masses.
Thou art a subject of the divine, created in the image of man...... by the masses, for the masses.
Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.
Work hard.
Increase production.
Prevent accidents.
And...... be happy.
If it will make you happy, just this once.
Now, be careful, it 's heavy.

Is that you?
We are sorry, but we must deny your request.
Birthborns are not allowed more than 5 units of enerval.
Substitution of enerval for etracene...... may cause a serious chemical imbalance.
Thank you.
Never before have we been so contented.
Never.

- Where did you get this car?
- I was just issued it.
I took it for a test drive and ran straight through a crowd at the dispersal center.
Oh, terrible.
Terrible.
No.
No, it was wonderful.
Because I didn 't hit anyone, just an 1 1 14.
What' s this?
Why did you change it?
- You' ve seen enough.
- Well, that' s wonderful.
- No, it' s terrible.
- You know I don' t feel well.
- Take your sedation.
- That is terrible, just terrible.
No, it was wonderful, wonderful.
Because my hand, it was paralyzed anyway.
That was very funny.
Remember, an enerval overdose may cause a serious chemical imbalance.
My time is yours.
Go ahead.
What 's wrong with me?
What am I to her or she to me?
Nothing.
- Yes, fine.
- She 's an ordinary roommate.
I share rooms with her.
- Our relationship is normal, conforming.
- Excellent.
We share nothing...... but space.
What is she doing to me?
Yes, I understand.
I think I' m dying.
Could you be more...... specific?
You are a true believer.
Blessings of the state.

I was so afraid.
So alone.
I wanted to touch you...... so many times.
I was happy.
Why get me involved?
They know.
They' ve been watching us.
I can feel it.
No one knows.
They' re watching us now.
No one can see us.
I can...... feel it.

You' il report me for drug violation.
I' ve got a slip movement to install on my next shift.
I' il never make it the way I am now.
I wouldn' t turn you in, not now.
- You don' t -- - I know I wouldn' t.
You can do it without etracene.
- You can.
I know you can.
- Then what?
It can' t go on forever, you know it can' t.
We could leave.
And live in the superstructure.
You only have one more shift left, don' t you?
We could be gone before the next series started.
It' s all right.
- It' s all right.
- Standing by.
What' s this?
I have to see SEN.
I' ve just been given a shift change.
- When?
- Now.
- Now?
- He wants me to come to his quarters.
A shift change should come through scheduling.
Why should he want to see you?
I don' t know.
- Don' t go.
- I have to.
He' s a G34.
You don' t have to.
I don' t trust him.
You ought to file a report.
No.
Don' t make trouble.
It' s nothing.
Then why did you bring it up?
I didn' t.
You asked me about the card.
You' re going to get us into trouble.
Do not push or shove at the fountain.
It' s more work for the cleaning detail.
- Did you copy that?
- The android, the hung- over writing.
Is he getting that?
Is he copying me?
This is borough- flow submaster.
Control, have you got that code yet?
I read you very badly.
I' il check the message....
- Twenty- three hunter portapods.
- lt 's you.
- Twenty- three hunter portapods.
- Come in, come in.
Sit down.
You know, this is really odd.
I was just thinking about you.
I must apologize for all this chaos.
They moved in this morning...... and it' s been going on all day.
The roommate was destroyed, you know.
Terrible inconvenience.
Have to try to see things in perspective, do what you can...... to make things...... fit.
I can accept things up to a point.
But if you get a chance...... to make...... adjustments...... you' re very foolish to pass them up.
Where is LUH?
- What?
- Your card, please.
Thank you.
This monitor is to be used for emergencies or special requests only.
All routine information can easily be obtained...... through the bulletin panels installed at --
Why did you have LUH come here?
Why are you so concerned?
What' s going on?
I want you for my roommate.
We' il be very good for one another.
I don' t understand.
Living --
Living selection is computed.
I know what you' re thinking.
Program- shifting isn' t that major a crime, is it?
You' re in violation.
Don' t say that.
What have you done to LUH?
She was here.
We...... had a long talk.
And she agreed that it would be better for both of you to switch.
She seemed to think that you weren' t accurately mated with her in the first place.
I' il never have another mate like ONA.
You rate very high in sanitation.
I' ve checked.
I don' t feel well.
We' il be happy.
Combined with the economic advantages of the mating structure...... it far surpasses any disadvantages in increased perversions.

Absolute.
The theater of noise is proof of our potential.
The circulation of prototypes.
The golden talisman underfoot is phenomenon approaching.
And in the history of now...... all ethos are designed.
Why are you here?
You 're not cleared for this area.
You know I have a way with computers.
I can program myself for any area, almost.
I' il report you.
Listen, no need to be distressed with me.
- Get out of here, leave me alone.
- I' ve taken care of LUH.
I programmed her to area 5450.
The transfer should come through by the next series.
You' re gonna need a new roommate.

If society is to free itself of these deviants --

Hey, doesn' t it zoom like --?

Well, at 387, our system was never completed.

No, but with the Mark 7, you had the same --

What if you put a dual display on it and I punch two up?
Yes, you can see two at once.
When you see three -- Punch a third, you' il see the numbers.
So it' s best to go back to two.
And really, to get an accurate reading....

3927, could you get him from where you are?
THX 1 1 38.
Hi.
I know you turned me in.
I' m doing quite well here anyway.
I' m setting some things up...... but it isn' t easy.
A very difficult balance, you know?
Now, let' s get something straight right from the start.
It' s gonna take you some time to see my overall plan.
So until then, stay out of things you don' t understand, right?
You' re gonna be making things more difficult for me.
It' s the least you can do.
What' s wrong with you?
- Don' t be like that.
- It' s all right.
You' re safe now.
When posterity judges our actions here...... it will perhaps see us not as unwilling prisoners...... but as men who, for whatever reason...... preferred to remain as non- contributing individuals on the edge of society.
- We must not let this happen.
- Countless diversions.
- Gentlemen, the choice is there.
- Reciting where we are.
- Arguing about leaving.
- Make no mistake.
- Predicting the future.
Ridiculous.
- We must choose a leader...
- What about keeping things livable here? -... to unite us.
- LUH 9998.
- LUH?
What happened?
Who' s gone?
- JOT.
- My friend, your point of view....
Yes, CAM, that' s it.
Your point is well taken, CAM...... but it lacks the balance that a broader and deeper range of experience can lend it.
When I first arrived here, I saw things as perhaps you do now.
Yes, I was confused about my predicament.
I longed to thrash out, to tear down, to destroy and annihilate...... to ravage, wreak havoc and plunder.
Being basically levelheaded, however...... I realized that my first goal should be to study this place...... where what seemed blind circumstance had placed me.
Listen to the mumblings of an old man...... and bank those flames with earnest inquiry and honest observation.
"Mumblings."
"Mumblings," you hear?
Know how many times we' ve listened to that speech?
Do you know how many times we' ve had to listen to that speech?
Thinks we' re as blind as him.
Know what you are?
You make me sick.
If we thought like you --
You know what I want?
I want ideas.
I want one idea.
One idea could get us out of here!
We' il just have to be sure it' s the right idea.
We' il find it.
We' il know it when we see it.
I' il know it when I see it!
Clear and straightforward and plain as the nose on your face.
-- believed he was going to a place where he' d be happy.
And in so believing, he created a veritable paradise for himself right here.
Unfortunately, not all of us can have the positive conviction of LOO.
But, thankfully, not all of us are burdened with the ominous forebodings of SEN.
I, myself --
Now, that' s what I mean by the wrong idea.
Look, I' m not going to try to prove the usefulness of history.
It is genuinely too obvious to need proof.
I want to help you.
You can help me.
Here.
Take a biscuit.
You understand, we' re all in this together.
You want to leave.
You' re not like them.
I' il see to it that we all get out of here.
Take it easy!
Look at them.
It' s pathetic.
It' s pitiful.
They' ve even begun to go into my corner and look for things.
My things.
You' re with me.
I know.
I have a contract.
All it says is:
"You' re with me."
We' re all in this together.
We must convince the others.
Later, then.
We need a new unity.
And not a unity which discourages dissent.
We need dissent, but we need a creative dissent.
Our voices are not raised in any harmonious chorus...... but our differences are differences of emphasis rather than of fundamentals.
- Tomorrow, as we -- - Nondescript 6431 399.
- What is it?
- A shell dweller.
They live in the outer shell.
Quite unique.
There have been two here before, and they smell.
What do you know?
Come here, my friend.
Let me touch you.
What' d he just do?
What' s wrong, huh?
Your lunch is dirty.
What a waste.
Here, we can save some of it.
It' s all right.
Everything' s fine.
What?
Well, if you didn' t want it, why' d you take it?
I thought this was all settled.
- Where you going?
- I' m leaving.
Leaving?
Leaving what?
You can' t leave.
You can' t go.
Hey, wait.
Oh, I know, the smell.
Yeah, it' s terrible.
It' s a little bit....
Hey, you can' t -- You can' t leave without....
Just a minute.
Wait.
Just wait there a minute.
After long deliberation, I have decided to go out...... and personally examine the barrier...... to learn firsthand what difficulties are involved...... and decide how to overcome them.
I recognize an element of risk...... but moments such as these require that a choice be made and action taken...... regardless of the danger.
We' il be back soon...... but we' il be gone long enough to form an accurate and functional escape.
And I shall have an honest idea how best to organize us into a working unit.
- The new alignment.
- lncredible.
Wait.
Wait.
Hey, wait for me.
Just the thing to put them on their feet.
Show them who the leaders are.
When we get back, they' il be right there, right in the palm of my hand.
There' s no question.
Even old PTO would be with us...... if he' d still been advised.
How far before they can' t see us anymore, huh?
Maybe we better sit down right here.
Hey, rest for a while.
I can' t....
I can' t see them anymore.
LUH.
You' re going after LUH, aren' t you?
Why, it' s ridiculous.
Going after....
Oh, wait, I knew there was something I had to tell you.
LUH, you know, the other --?
The new LUH?
He told me he' d seen her.
He saw her just before he came out here.
- She' s gonna be coming out here.
- How was she?
Oh, very well.
Very good health.
Just exactly the way --
- You' re lying.
- No, I am not.
The air' s getting thinner.
Or pressure' s getting greater.
It' s the pressure.
How do you feel?
Shouldn' t be this far.
There' s no air.
I haven' t got the time.
You can stay here if you like.
I' il come with you.
What?
Look.
What?
That' s a man.
It' s a man.
He' s waving.
He' s waving to us.
Hi.
Hi.
Hello.
Where' d you guys come from?
Oh, well, it doesn' t make any difference.
Is that food?
I' m starving.
Do you mind?
How did you get here?
I mean, I was lost.
You' re not lost now?
Know the way out?
- That' s the way out.
- That' s the way we came.
Yeah, but maybe you were traveling in circles.
That' s the way out.
How do you know?
Well, look.
Look more closely.
You see?
Come on.
Oh, yeah.
Nothing stopped us.
Come on.
Here' s a doorway.

I' m not real.
You know, the fantasy bureau...... electrically- generated realities and all that.

The expenditure ceiling on the THX case is 14, 000 credits.

Would you like part of this?
It' s not very much.

Halt.

Expenditures are 1 000 and rising.
Things don 't seem to make sense.
Sometimes I see things get left out...... and they don 't fit.
People don' t seem to see them.
Or they don' t know what to do.
Sometimes l --
Sometimes little....
A little adjustment...... can make all the difference.
I wanna do the right thing.
I wanna go back.
I....
I....
I can -- I can start again.
I can change.
I can -- I can help.
I just need a....
Need to rest up for a little while.
This is no place for prayer.
If you want to speak to OMM, you must go to a unichapel, you know that.

I' m okay.
I' m going now.
What' s your number and your prefix?
I' m gonna see this gets into your report.
No, I' m leaving now.
I' m sorry, I have to report all intruders.
- Where' s your identification badge?
- I lost it.
You' re in violation.
I' il have to report you to the authorities.
- No, it' s not my time.
- Please, just --
Trapped.
Trapped.
Looks like the only way out is the way we came in.
I' m hungry.
She' s not there.
Who are you looking for?
Can you hear me?
Stay calm.
Everything will be all right.
The door seems to be jammed.
Please check the lock on your side.
Everything will be all right.
We are here to help you.
Stay calm.
We are not going to harm you.
Everything will be all right.
Well, unless that computer has made a mistake...... that 's your roommate.
No, you 're wrong.
I hope that auxiliary load holds.
I' m almost through to the upper positive plates.
Upper positive plates?
Maybe you are right.
Maybe there' s something wrong with the computer.
I don' t know.
It' s a strange life.
Cybernetics, genetics, lasers and all those things.
I guess I' il never understand any of that stuff.
Guess maybe holograms are not supposed to.
THX 1 138 will be taken into custody at a minimal monetary expenditure.

- Good sleep?
- Not bad.
So where are we?
Where you from?
San Diego.
Left yesterday.
So you came Honolulu- Guam- Pago- here?
Long trip.
What do you do?
l’ m a psychologist.
Hey, a shrink.
They’ ve called in everything else.
How do you mean?
We’ ve ferried people out of Guam for the last 2 days.
Physicists, biologists, mathematicians, you name it.
Everybody being flown to the middle of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean.
What’ s going on?
They’ re not telling us anything, sir.
What did they tell you?
There was a plane crash.
Do you get called in on crashes?
l’ m on a list of psychologists the FAA brings in when a plane goes down.
So where exactly are we now?
Over there.
Here.
Take a look.
What is that?
All that for a plane crash?
I never mentioned a plane crash.
- Any other gear?
Watch your step.
- l’ d like to call my family.
We’ il get you settled in quarters first.
Remain there till we send for you.
- l’ d like to get started.
- We’ il send for you.
- lt’ s critical I see them -- - Who?
The survivors. lf I don’ t get to them in the first 24 hours --
- What survivors?
- The survivors of the plane crash.
Plane crash?
I deal in post- traumatic stress and survival guilt.
Maybe I should talk to someone who knows what’ s going on here.
- Talk to the ship’ s psychiatrist.
- l’ m a psychologist.
That’ s why I was sent here.
I told you people I need a phone.
Discuss that with Mr. Barnes.
That’ s fine.
Give me a phone, l’ il call him.
Why are you here?
Take your hands off me, please.
Do you have any idea who I am?
Tell him the name of the book you wrote.
Astrophysics You Can Use.
It was a Book- of- the- Month Club Main Selection.
Never heard of it.
You really thought he read your book.
You haven’ t changed.
It was written for the layman.
He’ s not impressed.
ls there a phone in here?
- l’ ve been trying to call my wife.
- Would you stop touching me?
Wait a minute.
Beth?
Flight quarters.
All units make your flight quarters...... condition one stations for landing.
Stay clear of the fantail --
Goodman, you been here long?
- l’ ve been here 3 hours.
- Welcome aboard.
This thing scares the hell out of me.
lt’ s already too late.
You might as well helicopter me back...... because the damage is done to the survivors already.
We’ il get to that.
- I don’ t even know who you are.
I know who you are.
Military?
What are you?
You ever hear of the OSSA?
They don’ t know who I am.
That should reassure you.
You haven’ t talked to anyone about this?
- I talked to the helicopter pilot.
- What’ d you tell him?
That’ s my job.
Plane crash.
Good.
There was no plane crash.
Spacecraft.
A spacecraft.
I guess that explains a lot.
- NASA?
- That doesn’ t surprise you?
At least it explains the secrecy.
The secrecy’ s critical, Norman.
You made that explicit in your report.
What report?
ULF.
I wrote that for the Bush administration.
And that’ s our bible here.
But that was a report about a possible encounter with an alien being.
You want to come with me?
Oh, boy.
About 3 weeks ago...... a ship laying fiber- optic cable between Honolulu and Sydney...... hit an obstruction 1, 000 feet underwater.
Cut this cable here clean as a shears.
The Navy got interested, sent out a search ship.
It turned out that what did it...... was this.
We took this with side- looking sonar.
This is an aerodynamic fin longer than a football field...... bigger than any known wingspan.
This is the fuselage.
This is ultrahigh- res SLS bottom scan.
Came in a week ago.
There it is, buried under about 8 yards of coral.
Something’ s wrong with that measurement.
You can set your watch by it.
That’ s right.
So you’ re saying this spacecraft crashed in the year....
1709.
So you’ re saying this spacecraft crashed 300 years ago?
288.
That’ s impossible.
lt’ s not impossible if this spacecraft came from an alien civilization.
Wait a minute.
You think this is an alien spacecraft?
lt’ s ridiculous.
We think there’ s an Unknown Life Form on the spacecraft.
That’ s why you’ re here.
You are the contact team that was recommended in the Goodman Report.
We have a biochemist...... to assess the physiology of the Unknown Life Form.
A mathematician, because that’ il probably be our common language.
And we have an astrophysicist to locate its place in the cosmos.
- Led by a psychologist.
- Right.
Nowadays, the little green men say, ’ ’ Take me to your therapist ’ ’?
Listen up.
’ ’ Contact teams meeting an Unknown Life Form or ULF...... must be prepared for severe psychological impact.
Stress reaction of confronting such life has not been sufficiently studied...... and cannot be entirely predicted in advance.
But the most likely consequence of contact is...... absolute terror. ’ ’
That’ s from Norman’ s report.
l’ m sorry, are these parameters correct?
You’ re saying that you have a spacecraft over a half a mile long...... that crashed into the ocean 300 years ago and it’ s completely intact?
That’ s right.
And the kicker is, our sonar is picking up a low- level hum.
Something’ s still running inside.
There’ s no way this coral could’ ve grown faster than an inch a year?
That’ s what we’ re going there to see.
Who says?
Harry, that’ s a joke, right?
Bigger!
The idea that we’ re not alone, it’ il change everything.
Evidence of extraterrestrial life.
You don’ t want to see that?
I got to say that I resent this briefing very much.
And how’ s that?
lf Norman’ s report calls for a biologist, a mathematician...... an astrophysicist and a psychologist...... why are you here?
Physical protocols start in a half an hour.
You always wear glasses?
I just started wearing these.
Are the glasses a problem?
I don’ t actually need them.
They’ re just for reading.
I see fine without them.
But they didn’ t anticipate l’ d be going 1, 000 feet under the water.
Do you take prescription medication?
No.
None at all?
Once in a while sometimes I might take like a...... a piece of Xanax or something if l’ m nervous.
Something like that.
But not...... much.
Knee surgery.
Complete reconstruction of ACL, right knee.
Still have steel pin here, steel pin here, little medial collateral damage.
I see that you have a scar on your neck.
Car accident.
- Were you drinking?
- Yeah.
But I wasn’ t driving.
Wait, I just want to apologize for putting your name on the list.
Why?
When I made the report a few years ago, I picked names of people I knew.
And?
I know Ted because of his father.
- Yeah, so what?
- Beth was a patient.
lt’ s a bogus report.
Did you tell Barnes?
You can’ t do that.
That’ s fraud.
They came to me, new administration, right?
Political agenda.
They said, in case of an alien invasion, do’ s and don’ ts.
Why didn’ t you just say no?
$35, 000.
It paid the down payment on my house.
New administration wanted to prove they’ re doing something new.
How’ d you come up with this team...... of a biologist, an astrophysicist and a mathematician?
Right.
- How?
- I don’ t know.
It sounded good, right?
Made them come to me.
I forgive you, Norman.
I forgive you!
But I don’ t forgive you for Ted.
He’ s a pain in the ass.
l’ il talk to him.
You don’ t have to be around him.
He idolizes you anyways, but l’ il talk to him. l’ il buy you dinner.
- l’ m sorry.
Come on.
l can’ t believe this thing could....
Like a dream.
Have you called your wife?
Why not?
You’ il be going to a habitat in 1, 000 feet of water.
A sub will take you to the Habitat and you’ il transfer aboard.
At 1, 000 feet, your body will be pressurized for that depth.
The pressure wouldn’ t bother you.
Although I wouldn’ t recommend it because the water’ s so cold...... you’ d freeze to death in less than 2 minutes.
That’ s the reason for the diving suits.
Your helmet has a rebreather for your air supply.
Following this briefing, l’ il take you to an onboard dive tank.
For the next 8 hours...... you’ il train in deep- saturation dive techniques and emergency procedures.
Once you’ ve gone down 1, 000 feet...... if you surface, you’ il have to commit to several days of decompression.
There is no real quick return.
However, there is a mini- sub...... that may be used as an emergency escape vehicle.
But there must be a ship at the surface to mate to for decompression.
Without decompression, your body would literally burst.
Under these circumstances, you’ re very well- controlled.
The dive has been planned well and professionally monitored.
The descent will take about 13 minutes, descending at 80 feet a minute.
lt’ s going to get chilly.
Try to relax.
Next time, just tell us when you’ re going to push the button.
Mozart...... Horn Concerto in E- flat...... K- 447.
How you holding up, Captain Nautical?
- l’ m loose.
- You’ re loose?
l’ m loose. l’ m loose.
l’ m uptight.
- We okay?
- We’ re in the river now.
What river?
lt’ s a temperature/ salinity differential.
It flows like a river inside the ocean.
- Under the ocean and there’ s a river.
- That’ s right.
You okay?
Right now, l’ m not okay.
Would you please not touch me?
We’ re both nervous.
Would you cut that out, please?
You’ re having a stress reaction.
That’ s Harry’ s stress reaction.
Those noises we’ re hearing, that’ s normal?
Those noises are the water pressure attacking the sub’ s integrity.
You know a little something about that, don’ t you, Norman?
How the pressure can attack your integrity.
Come on, you be nice this trip.
Were you nice last time?
You two want to sit together?
My God!
Norman, look at this, look at this.
That’ s just the fin.
That’ s the Habitat.
The Navy moved it in sections and set it up as a base...... as soon as the spaceship was discovered.
It will be your home- away- from- home while we investigate the spacecraft.
It ain’ t the Motel 6.
Approaching docking bay from R- 4.
All personnel, descent sub one engaging lock area.
You are now depressurized.
We’ re going to pressurize you now.
That’ s the helium.
- Helium?
- Was I the only one paying attention?
Oxygen is a corrosive gas, in the same family as fluorine and chlorine...... hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid.
That’ s why we’ re breathing helium.
Because oxygen at any level higher than 2. 3 becomes toxic.
Can you run that by me again, Ted?
I don’ t speak balloon.
What?
That’ s my voice.
The helium resonates differently with my vocal chords. ’ ’ Follow the yellow brick road. ’ ’
Kiddies, cut it out.
Put them on.
The Navy dive team is setting up a hydraulic robot...... in the air lock outside the spacecraft.
We’ il use that to open its door.
ls that the door?
Yeah, we used sonar imaging to pinpoint it before the divers went down.
- How tall is that robot?
- Five feet.
And it’ s roughly the same size as an airplane door, isn’ t it?
- Excuse me, Ted.
- I think that’ s worth taking note of.
Excuse me.
Tell them our team is in place and ready, okay?
This is Habitat to Navy dive.
Has it occurred to anyone maybe we shouldn’ t open that door?
Why do you say that?
We assume they’ il be green...... or insect- like, but basically human.
But what if they inhale air and exhale cyanide gas? lt’ s plausible.
Or live forever, like a virus or a yeast.
But why would you assume that a ULF would want to kill us?
lt’ d have no concept of it.
lnstant eradication. lt’ s what all the serious scientific stuff talks about.
What little there is on the subject.
You did put that in your report?
lt’ s in there.
Get us the ETD for team’ s departure to surface.
Tell them we’ re in ready and thank them.
Habitat to Navy Dive.
Our team’ s ready to take over.
Descent sub ready for your return to surface.
Thanks for all your help.
We’ il let you know what we find.
l’ m not too thrilled at the prospect of this.
What if you have to go to the bathroom?
Just go down your leg, Ted.
Really?
You can urinate in these?
You can.
The question is, do you want to?
Where’ s the switch?
Okay, let’ s go.
All right, Fletcher...... we’ re at 1, 022 feet.
The ambient temperature, 34 degrees.
Heading out north- northwest...... 330.
lt’ s a firm bottom.
lntermittent coral.
This is great, you guys.
Look at the size of that thing!
My God!
You see that tunnel?
That’ s where we’ re going.
lnto the heart of darkness.
We’ re in the coral pipe now, Fletcher, approaching the air lock.
l’ m feeling pressure in my ears.
ls that normal?
Just use your equalizer.
A little better.
The most toxic creatures on Earth live down here.
The venom of the land animal is nothing by comparison.
Even the weakest sea snake is invariably lethal.
ls that supposed to make me feel good, Beth?
This is our air lock.
lt’ il take us from a wet to a dry environment.
We’ re assuming the inside of the ship is sealed.
This thing is enormous.
That' s not budging, is it?
- Turn it at 45 degrees.
- What’ s happening here?
Is that piston broken?
Can you get the suction cup flat to the plane of the door?
Maybe it’ s the hydraulics.
The pressure messes everything up at this depth.
Time for a demonstration in basic physics, gentlemen.
What is it, Harry?
Take a look.
lt’ s chipped.
So what?
l thought you said this thing wasn’ t damaged when it crashed...... that this titanium alloy was so super- strong, you can’ t hurt it.
I did.
So why does it chip when this scientist just bangs it with a hammer?
ls there heat coming off this thing?
You’ re right.
Back up.
Just a minute.
I mean, get back now!
Get back.
Jesus.
Anybody else wonder who the hell opened that door?
How did that happen?
l’ m not sure about the atmosphere.
Helmets stay on.
All right.
We come in peace.
Always wanted to say that.
Fletcher, inform the Navy we’ ve gained access...... to the spacecraft.
There' s a hell of a lot of radiation shielding in here.
Huge grids of catwalks and plumbing...
... and a lot of steam.
lt’ s endless.
We’ il stay in touch here.
Somebody’ s been here.
There’ s footsteps and they ain’ t ours.
So what do you say, Norman?
Time to turn back?
l’ m a little curious.
Break up into 2 squads.
We’ il never cover the territory otherwise.
Split up?
We’ ve only got about a half- hour of breathing time left.
Ted and Harry, you come with me.
Beth, Norman, stick together.
Come on.
I think the people who built this place would call that ’ ’ divide and conquer. ’ ’
Whoever built this thing wanted us dead, we’ d be dead already.
These guys offer a federal grant to study the effects of an alien invasion.
I told all this to Harry.
You made up the report?
No, not all of it.
I mean, I did research on half of it.
Who did the other half?
I borrowed from, you know, good writers.
lsaac Asimov, Rod Serling....
Rod Serling?
You know?
I show up here, half the Pacific fleet is here.
I wanted to tell you, that’ s all.
ls this in the same category as, ’ ’ Beth, I thought you knew I was married ’ ’?
I don’ t think we have enough oxygen --
- Oh, my God.
- Did you push something?
It did it on its own.
That must be the cockpit.
Hold on.
Look at this.
Cross- stress bracing on the outer hulls.
Look at this stuff.
This is interesting.
Soft and strong at the same time.
lt’ s, like, better than rubber, better than steel.
You know a lot about this stuff.
I studied aeronautical engineering at M. l. T.
lsn’ t that where you got your Ph. D.?
All 3 of them.
I hated M. l. T.
Envy?
Puberty.
How old?
First Ph. D., 18.
Damn.
You beat me by one year.
Let’ s push on.
Let’ s go.
Man, they didn’ t tell you how heavy these things were out of the water.
Look at this.
Come here.
’ ’ Trash. ’ ’
"Basura."
Trash?
Oh, God.
Jesus!
lt’ s human.
You mean humanoid.
No, Norman, I mean human.
Blunt force trauma.
You can see by the direction that the fracture runs...... that he was hit in the back of the head.
What’ s in his hand?
I don’ t know.
What is it?
’ ’ Smokehouse Almonds ’ ’?
My God, it’ s an American spaceship.
It can’ t be an American spaceship.
lt’ s 300 years old.
There weren’ t even Americans, let alone spaceships.
It can’ t be, but it is.
Let’ s see if there’ s some kind of flight recorder or data computer...... where we can ring up some kind...... of a flight history.
Look at this. lt’ s in English.
Okay, good.
Right there.
And there.
Look at the dates!
Can’ t be.
Could be.
It could be 2043 or 1643.
I don’ t know which one is weirder.
’ ’ Unknown Entry Event. ’ ’ Press it.
You sure?
This is Barnes, Norman.
Yeah, I can hear you.
I can’ t explain it, but I think we’ re inside an American spaceship.
It gets better.
What the hell is it?
Whatever it is, it seems to be what this bird was designed to do.
Go out into space and gather things like this up and bring it back.
Yeah, but back from where?
Don’ t get too excited, Ted.
Turn this thing over, it’ il probably say ’ ’ Made in Korea. ’ ’
Somehow I doubt that.
No doors.
No hinges of any kind.
l’ il bet if you put a laser micrometer on this, it’ d be a perfect sphere.
Perfect to a thousandth of an inch.
That’ s a message in and of itself.
- Really?
- What do you mean?
When Pope Benedict asked Giotto to prove his worth as an artist...... Giotto drew a perfect circle...... freehand.
Perfection.
lt’ s a powerful message.
- I know what the Zen masters would say.
- What’ s that?
’ ’ This ball wants to be caught. ’ ’
Nobody built this thing looking into their third eye.
They went to a lot of trouble and they didn’ t do it for nothing.
Something put this thing out there to get picked up and brought back here.
Have you forgotten the Trojan horse?
It could be a trap.
Don’ t you think that’ s a little paranoid?
No, l’ m going to put a video camera on this thing and keep an eye on it.
Can I ask you something about this reflective surface?
Yeah, it appears to be mercury, doesn’ t it?
Except mercury’ s liquid at this temperature.
That’ s not what l’ m talking about.
What worries me is that it’ s reflecting everything but us.
I hate to be the one non- scientist that picks this up, guys.
You know what I mean?
What do you think it is?
I don’ t know.
Whatever it is...
... it’ s alien.
Okay, an American spacecraft, materials, technology...... more advanced than what we know, crashes into the ocean.
Why wasn’ t it damaged?
The materials are obviously super- strong.
lf that’ s true, why did it chip when you hit it?
Better:
It didn’ t crash.
It arrived...... 300 years ago.
- From where?
- Not ’ ’ where. ’ ’ When.
So you’ re saying this thing took a wrong turn?
That’ s right.
I mean, what if the craft...... inadvertently flew into a black hole?
It arrived in our past from its present.
The dates in the flight record -- 43, 47.
That has to be 2043, 2047.
The image you saw, what you described...... sounds like a black hole, a tear in the space --
We know what a black hole is.
I don’ t know.
lt’ s a collapsed star with so much gravity it’ s like a vacuum cleaner...... sucking everything into it, light, interstellar dust, time --
- Time?
- lt’ s possible, but not plausible.
lt’ s rudimentary astrophysics.
We just haven’ t been able to fly into one and prove it.
I just got off the horn topside.
They’ re expecting a bad blow up there.
And they’ re pulling us out.
Wait a minute!
What do you mean?
What part of ’ ’ pull out ’ ’ don’ t you understand?
Extraction.
We’ re leaving.
That’ s ridiculous.
We haven’ t even begun to scratch the surface here.
lf you’ ve ever seen a Pacific cyclone, what we call a tornado is a little fart.
So I suggest you go back to the dormitory and take a nap.
You need to lower your metabolism before we start the decompression.
You’ re leaving a time- traveling spacecraft at the bottom of the ocean?
l’ m just following my orders.
But, no aliens.
- It was made in America.
- What’ s your point?
My point is, l’ m a biochemist and there’ s no life down here.
What is wrong with you?!
That doesn’ t mean there’ s nothing to learn, to explore!
She’ s right.
You guys are the human contact team for an Unknown Life Form.
There is no Unknown Life Form, so we pull out at 0900.
- Please say something to him.
- What?
Do you not have an opinion about this?
l’ m delighted we’ re going back up top.
You know what I mean?
This may look like a roadside diner, but in the meantime...... my ears won’ t pop and if I pull this thing away from my neck...... l sound like someone’ s squeezing my testicles.
Barnes is wrong, you know.
You mean, wrong about the storm?
No, about the Sphere.
What about the Sphere?
lt’ s alive.
Why do you say that?
There’ s something inside it.
How can there be anything inside it?
There’ s no door, no seams.
The Sphere chooses what it will and won’ t reflect.
Doesn’ t that seem like the actions of a conscious being to you?
Pop psychology.
I think, for whatever it’ s worth, you’ re angry...... towards our friend Ted in there...... because he figured this out before you did.
You really think so?
This is my first underwater session.
You’ re right.
Ted did figure it out first, didn’ t he?
Good shrinkage.
We’ re all going to die down here, you know.
What?
What?
You see, it’ s curious.
Ted did figure it out.
Time travel.
And when we get back, we’ re going to tell everyone...... how it’ s possible, how it’ s done, what the dangers are.
But why 50 years in the future, when the spacecraft encounters a black hole...... does the computer call it an ’ ’ Unknown Entry Event ’ ’?
Why don’ t they know?
lf they don’ t know...... it means we never told anyone.
And if we never told anyone...... it means we never made it back.
Hence...... we die down here.
Just as a matter of deductive logic, Norman.
Damn, I wish I could get inside that Sphere.
- What’ s wrong?
- Talk to Mr. Barnes.
- Where is he?
- Video feed room.
Where is that?
I don’ t know where the hell anything is.
Where am l?
Where?
What’ s going on?
I don’ t know.
You tell me.
- What the hell is he doing?
- I don’ t know.
Do you know what he’ s doing?
- I need to know what you know.
- Nothing.
He wanted to go inside.
We are inside.
You mean outside?
- He said, ’ ’ inside. ’ ’ - What? lnside the spacecraft?
I think inside the Sphere.
Holy shit!
My God.
Did he go inside?
- I don’ t think so.
- What the hell’ s going on?
He didn’ t just disappear.
I think it’ s a glitch in the video.
Give me playback on that.
You’ il have it in a minute.
You knew he was doing this and you said nothing.
- You didn’ t think!
- I didn’ t think it possible.
Where are Beth and Ted?
I don’ t know.
I woke up, I heard bells ringing and I started running --
I' m not getting an image on the sub.
Impossible!
I got a cable in my quarters!
They’ il be here in 25 minutes or less!
The only logical explanation is that the sub is still at the surface.
ls it also logically possible your sonar is messed up?!
Let’ s just calm down, all right?
He didn’ t just disappear.
We are not going to leave him.
You got that right.
I am not going to lose a civilian on my watch.
You have just screwed up our trip to the surface.
We are not going up to the surface.
Harry!
We are not going up!
Harry!
Can you hear me?
Harry, can you hear me?
Norman, this is not a triage situation.
Go find me Ted and Beth.
Norman, stop.
Still no reading on the sub.
Forget the goddamn sonar, Teeny.
All right?
What the hell?
Can you hear me?
ls he alive?
Harry’ s out cold.
His pulse is normal.
All his vitals are normal...... but I don’ t get it.
Hello.
Hello!
Norman, can you hear me?
We lost video here.
Can you hear me?
- That tears it.
- What, sir?
We’ re on internal power.
I don 't follow you.
They cut us loose, Teeny.
For some reason the sub turned back.
Break out your 5- day deodorant pads.
We' re here for the duration.
Everything’ s normal.
ls he all right?
What did he say?
He didn’ t say.
He’ s aphasic.
He’ s asleep, Ted.
I can’ t believe he went inside.
He didn’ t say anything?
There’ s no door, no entry.
How did he get in?
Can I have your attention, please?
We' ve lost contact with the surface.
The Habitat is now operating solely under internal power.
We have plenty of food, oxygen and fresh water...... to sustain us until the storm is over...... and we reestablish contact with the surface.
But until that time, this mission is subject...... to emergency authority under my command.
l’ m taking this out to the mini- sub.
- Are you up on the duty roster?
- Yes, sir.
Where’ s she going?
lt’ s procedures.
Everything in the Habitat is videoed.
Every 1 2 hours we take the videos to the mini- sub and press the reset button.
The idea is, if something happens to us and we don’ t reset it...... the sub goes to the surface automatically.
lf we’ re all dead, they at least have a partial record of what went wrong.
Cheerful thought, huh?
Mind the store a minute.
l’ m going to the head.
What the hell’ s that?
lt’ s so beautiful down here.
lt’ s so tranquil.
This is beautiful.
lt’ s hard to believe we have a typhoon 1, 000 feet above our heads.
Hey, it' s snowing down here.
You see them?
There' s got to be a million...... jellyfish down here.
Man, this is really beautiful.
These jellyfish are getting a little friendly.
Having a hard time seeing.
Hey, guys, you getting this?
It' s getting thick down here.
Hello, hello.
I can 't see what I' m doing.
They’ re sticking to my faceplate.
Fletcher, this is Dr. Fielding.
Just swim through them.
They’ re harmless.
Guys, these jellyfish are everywhere.
Fletcher, get out of there.
What are jellyfish doing at 1, 000 feet?
I think they feel the heat from my body.
I can’ t get them off me!
They’ re stinging through my suit!
Get back to the Habitat on the double.
I can’ t move my legs!
Come back to the Habitat.
They’ re inside my suit!
Just keep moving!
Help me!
Jesus, Barnes, she' s dead!
There' s no bubbles.
Edmunds.
Yes, sir?
Come on down here.
Something...... happened to Fletcher.
God!
When I was 5 years old I went out on a boat with my father.
He told me not to jump in the water, so of course I did and....
Oh, my!
I jumped right into a school of these guys.
Not this big, though.
I don’ t know what this lady felt...... but, man, it went beyond pain.
l’ ve been...
... afraid of them since.
Would you feel any better if I told you this wasn’ t exactly a jellyfish?
You mean...?
I mean, jellyfish like this are unheard of.
I don’ t know what this is, but it isn’ t God’ s creation.
Here I am Your special island
Come to me
Bali Ha 'i
You can come in.
Have a seat.
You want some coffee?
- No, thanks.
- How well do you know Dr. Halperin?
I used to teach at UC San Diego years ago.
She came for her master’ s.
Don’ t take it personally, but I assume she wasn’ t a romantic interest.
Don’ t take what personally?
She’ s a tall, vibrant, younger woman.
What’ s your point?
You knew her as a patient.
l’ m not at liberty to discuss that.
You understand.
I understand an exotic- gas environment 1, 000 feet under water...... with no lifeline to the surface...... is about the most dangerous environment on the planet.
lf there’ s a problem, I got to know about it.
- Beth is fine. - ’ ’ Beth is fine. ’ ’
- She’ s very fine.
Would you like to read this and tell me what it says?
- What does it say?
- How in the world did you get -- - Does it say ’ ’ suicide attempt ’ ’? ’ ’ Electroshock therapy ’ ’?
lsn’ t that what it says?
What’ s your point?
Didn’ t it seem important enough to tell somebody?
You were willing to jeopardize these people’ s lives...... to have someone here who could be mentally unstable?
Are you aware of the term, ’ ’ overreact ’ ’?
We’ re 160 fathoms down.
And we’ ve got a nutbag down here who can flip out and crack up.
Why didn’ t you tell me?
When I wrote this, I didn’ t know the team would be 1, 000 -- 1, 000 or 10, it makes no difference!
Why didn’ t you tell me about Beth?
It wasn’ t pertinent.
That was not your call to make!
It was a passive attempt.
A passive attempt?!
Those who really want to kill themselves shoot themselves or go over a bridge.
They don’ t call their boyfriend and say, ’ ’ I just took 20 Nebutol.
Help me. ’ ’
She took 20 yellows, and you’ re telling me she’ s perfect.
What is it?
Come in.
What?
He’ s awake?
He’ s really awake.
Man, oh, man!
You’ re going to have a problem with me.
lf my good buddy Norman keeps cooking like this, I ain’ t going nowhere.
This toast is good.
Better.
These eggs are fantastic!
Norman, what did you put in these eggs?
No, no, wait.
Don’ t tell me.
Parsley.
Tarragon and....
What is that?
ls that chervil?
Yes, it is.
l’ m glad you like it, Harry.
I love eggs!
They sure seem to cheer you up.
Do you remember what happened?
I went inside.
How did you get inside?
There are doors all over this place and we can’ t get out.
- We’ re still here.
- Yes, we are.
You didn’ t answer my question.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Harry, are you saying we shouldn’ t still be here?
Where’ s Teeny?
I thought she did all the cooking.
She had an unfortunate accident, Harry.
She was killed.
Killed?
How?
Jellyfish.
Jellyfish?
That’ s strange.
Yes, it is strange, isn’ t it?
Here you go, Harry.
- Little onion rings.
- lt’ s not onion rings.
Good, though.
Guess what it is.
Calamari!
You all right?
Cough, cough, cough.
- No, you’ re doing it wrong.
- I know what l’ m doing.
Bring it up.
Come on, bring it up.
He’ s trying to talk.
You don’ t listen.
He wants to say something!
- See?
I hate squid.
I hate squid.
l’ m sorry.
I was trying to help.
You okay?
Harry, let me ask you something.
Before you went in the Sphere, you were convinced we would die here.
Yeah, I remember that.
You still believe it?
You afraid of dying, Norman?
Bullshit!
He’ s hiding something and you know it.
He went inside the Sphere and whatever it is he saw, he won’ t tell us.
- He said he doesn’ t remember anything.
- You bought that?
The whole food thing was all a diversion.
The guy’ s willing to put all of our lives on the line...... because he doesn’ t want to share information.
I can see it.
He wants to win the Nobel Prize.
And you don’ t?
Norman, you’ ve known me since I was 17 years old.
I would love to be the guy who gets --
Do you know how respected --
l’ m not! l’ ve written one ’ ’ Fun With Dick and Jane ’ ’ book on physics.
I mean, Niels Bohr...... he published ’ ’ The Quantum Theory of Atomic Structure ’ ’ at 28.
Einstein, relativity, 26.
Newton, gravity, 23.
ln physics, if you haven’ t done it by 35, chances are you never will.
This doesn’ t have anything to do with your competitiveness with Harry?
19.
Wunderkind!
I rest my case.
Mr. Barnes would like to see you.
Something’ s wrong with the computer system.
- I tried.
It just keeps coming back.
Discharge from the buffer memory?
I ruled that out.
The helium is getting to the chips.
lt’ s probably a saturation effect.
- lf that’ s true, what are our options?
- You have to change all the chips.
Run this place on manual?
lt’ s going to be a long 4 days.
Hey, boss.
- Figured that out yet?
- lt’ s a saturation effect.
I don’ t think so. lf it’ s a saturation effect, it would be random.
What do you mean?
This has a pattern.
See? lt’ s like a code.
A code from where?
How’ d you do that?
How’ d you see that?
Try binary.
Letter breaks.
You think this is coming from the Sphere?
Don’ t know.
This mission is ultra top- secret.
What you translate is for my eyes only.
lf you were it, how would you know our alphabet?
Same way it’ s configured on a keyboard.
But reflected in an orb, spherically.
A keyboard, but spherical.
Take a keyboard...... wrap it around a sphere...... then starting at the center key, G, number the letters...... spiraling out.
- You the man!
- I still got it.
I still got the juice.
Keyboard.
They let you keep those?
Here, you want them?
All we got to do now is plug in the numbers.
Friends...... in the 8, 000 years of recorded history, this is a first.
You’ re now on- line with an alien intelligence.
You got to be kidding.
You must’ ve messed up the translation.
I don’ t think so.
lf this is right, this alien sounds like an idiot.
That’ s something to consider.
They must have them.
I will admit the message is childlike, but actually it’ s quite perfect.
lt’ s short, to the point, non- threatening...... kind of the way you talk to a small child or a dog.
Look at this.
He’ s making a speech.
Ask him for his last name.
What?
I want a full name for my report.
l’ m not putting in my report I lost a crew member on a deepsat expedition...... to find an alien named Jerry.
Please! ’ ’ Jerry ’ ’?
We ought to tell him that we’ re enjoying it too.
Ask him where he’ s from.
Where are you from?
’ ’ I make a journey.
You make a journey.
We make a journey together. ’ ’
I think Jerry’ s channeling Deepak Chopra.
A journey from where?
He’ s happy.
He’ s crafty.
What happened?
Damn, I think we lost him.
We’ re not alone.
We are definitely...... not alone.
lt’ s trying to make contact with us.
Whatever it is, it was inside that Sphere.
Now it’ s out, free to act.
What do you mean by that?
Free to take over our computers...... call us on the phone, come knock on the door if it wants to.
A physical presence.
What are you thinking about?
That last part where he said, ’ ’ I am happy. ’ ’
Don’ t you want Jerry to be happy?
Honestly?
What’ s on your mind?
I would be happy if Jerry had no emotions whatsoever.
Because the thing of it is, here’ s Jerry...... an emotional being, cooped up for 300 years with no one to talk to...... none of the socialization, the emotional growth...... that comes from contact with other emotional beings....
So?
What happens if Jerry gets mad?
What is that sound?
Did you hear it?
You hear that thump?
What is that sound?
Can you hear me?
Did you hear that thump?
You are a hell of a woman.
I wish I knew you in the old days.
Norman told me you were --
Norman told you what?
Let’ s put it this way, that if Jerry could read your mind...... he’ d be bored with ours.
What is that sound?
Can you hear me?
This is Norman.
Something’ s going on.
It looks like Edmunds is up on the side of the Habitat.
I' m not getting anything on sonar, but watch yourselves out there.
Would you hit your callback buttons, please?
What’ d you tell Barnes?
About what?
About me.
You told him I took 20 Nebutol and tried to kill myself.
Didn’ t you?
What do you want me to do?
Did you tell him who I called?
Oh, God.
Come in.
Did you guys find that thumping yet?
Excuse me, Mr. Filby!
- He' s merely been detained.
This is such a lost of time!
lf he' s not coming, I have more important things to do.
Well, speak up.
What is it, woman?
Apparently we are.
- How long has he been gone?
- I' m not certain, sir.
Several days.
I' ve hardly seen him for some time.
He only comes in and picks at his food.
But he did tell me about dinner, and left those instructions.
Thank you, Mrs. Watchett.
- What' s it say, Filby?
- Nothing, really.
George says that if he' s not here by 8, we' re to begin without him.
Walter, what time is it?
First sensible thing I' ve heard all evening.
This is peculiar.
He' s usually prompt, precise and punctual.
He' s making fools of us by not showing up.
It' s ungentlemanly.
- Yes.
A waste of time.
One thing I like about George: best cellar in England.
- Good Lord!
What' s happened?
- I' m all right.
Some food.
A drink.
- I didn' t recognize you.
Can' t you speak?
What happened to you?
- I' ve got to tell it while I remember.
- Relax.
Try to relax.
You' ve all the time in the world.
You' re right, David.
That' s exactly what I have.
All the time in the world.
Since we were together five days ago...... the last day of 1 899.
There in that box rests the result of two years' labor.
I wanted to finish the job before the new century began.
I barely made it.
- Cheers, gentlemen.
- Marvelous, old boy.
Yes, but what is it?
Well, it has to do with time.
I' ve always maintained that this nation...... needs a reliable timepiece.
The navy needs one.
You couldn' t do better, George.
That' s why you' ve been in hiding?
Very clever of you, indeed.
I don' t think George is referring to a new timepiece.
When I speak of time, I' m referring to the fourth dimension.
Go on, George.
Really, Filby.
Surely they taught you something in school.
Suppose you explain it, doctor.
Certainly.
For example, when I move in a line, forward or backward...... that' s one dimension.
When I move left or right, two dimensions.
When I move up or down...... three dimensions.
For instance, that box.
length, breadth and height.
What is the fourth dimension?
That' s mere theory.
No one knows if the fourth dimension exists.
On the contrary.
The fourth dimension is as real and true as the other three.
ln fact, they couldn' t exist without it.
What do you mean?
Let' s take that box.
It has the first three dimensions.
- What' s inside?
- I' m coming to that.
Let' s consider this first.
Why do we ignore the fourth dimension?
Because we can' t move within it.
We can move in the other three:
Up, down, forward, sideways, backward.
No.
You' ve given a lucid explanation but I' m afraid I don' t understand.
There are many things you don' t understand, yes?
Quite a number.
Yet you don' t refuse to believe in them?
- Not if I can see the proof myself.
- Good, Walter.
Gentlemen, all I' m asking you...... is to witness a demonstration of movement...... within the fourth dimension.
- Doctor, can I have your help?
- Certainly.
It' s beautiful!
- Remarkable.
- Very nice, George.
Fascinating.
What is it?
This is only an experimental model.
- To carry a man, I need a larger one.
- To carry a man?
Where?
lnto the past or into the future.
This is a time machine.
You' ve had your joke.
Tell us what this contraption is for.
I' ve already told you.
The larger model can carry a passenger through time.
Not through space, but through time.
lf you go to the future, won' t you mess things up for us?
It cannot be changed.
I wonder.
That' s the most important question I hope to answer.
Can man control his destiny?
Can he change the shape of things to come?
lf you' ve gone mad, I forgive you.
- But if you' re wasting our time -- - No!
You' re here as witnesses.
- To see, not to listen.
- To see?
What?
The experiment I' m about to perform.
Let me tell you how it works.
The time traveler sits in the saddle.
ln front are the controls.
Let' s do this properly.
You can spare a cigar, I trust?
Let us imagine that this cigar...
... is the time traveler.
The lever in front of him controls movement.
Forward pressure sends it into the future...... backward pressure, into the past.
The harder the pressure, the faster it travels.
Our little experiment can be performed only once.
lf it succeeds, I lose my model.
That' s why I need witnesses.
Go ahead, George.
Ready, gentlemen?
Lend me your hand, please.
I' il be damned!
It worked.
- Where did it go?
- Go?
Nowhere, in the usual sense.
It' s still here.
But it' s no longer in the present.
It' s traveling through time.
To the future, to be exact.
You expect us to believe that?
Certainly.
- You said it hadn' t really moved.
- That' s correct.
Then why can' t we see it?
Because we' re in this room on December 31, 1 899...... but the model is perhaps a hundred years away by now.
This house may not be here in 1 00 years.
But the time machine occupies the same space...... as before its journey.
lf it' s occupying the same space, why can' t I feel it?
The space you' re putting your hand through is today' s space.
You can' t put your hand into tomorrow' s space.
Space doesn' t change!
The same space that' s here now should be here forever.
No, Philip, time changes space!
This flat ground could' ve been at the bottom of the sea long ago.
A million years from now, it could be the interior of a huge mountain.
lf all this is true, what do you expect to do with such a contraption?
Contraption?
Or perhaps the doctor would volunteer to go?
Well, look here, George...... suppose you do go off to the 50th century... -... how will you get back?
- That' s a risk I' m ready to take.
Now, look here, George.
I don' t know what you think, but we' re not fools!
We' re practical businessmen.
What I want to ask you is this:
Even if you had invented a time machine, what of it?
What' s its use?
Who' d buy it?
How much would it cost?
Have you thought of the commercial possibilities?
No, I haven' t.
George...!
There' s a war on in South Africa.
The Boers are putting up a fight.
The country needs inventors like you.
I can put you in touch with the War Office.
What do you think, David?
Dr. Hillyer has a good point, George.
That' s more sensible.
I' il see to it right away.
Good Lord!
It' s time to go.
Yes, I' m sure we all have plans for tonight.
- Are you all right, George?
- Yes, I' m all right.
Coming, Bridewell?
Thanks for coming.
- Good night.
- Happy New Year.
- Happy new century, George.
Happy New Year!
I thought I' d better stay.
You shouldn' t trouble yourself.
I' m all right.
No, you' re not.
You' ve been behaving oddly for over a month.
I' il leave, once you tell me what' s on your mind.
I appreciate the gesture.
I just want to be left alone.
Enormously.
Will you answer me one question, honestly?
Yes, I' il try.
Why this preoccupation with time?
Why not?
Don' t go simple on me.
The truth is, I don' t much care for the time I was born into.
People aren' t dying fast enough.
And I agree with you.
I agree, but here we are and we have to make the best of it.
You may have to.
I don' t.
All right.
Take your journey on your contraption.
What would you become?
A Greek?
A Roman?
- A pharaoh?
- I prefer the future.
You' re not seriously saying you can do it?
You saw the experiment, didn' t you?
I saw a toy machine vanish.
I' m sure there are any number of ways of doing that trick.
Any magician could probably do it.
It wasn' t a trick!
- Want to see the full- scale model?
- No, I don' t.
And I don' t think you should.
- It' s not for man to trifle with.
- You carry on like Hillyer and Kemp.
I speak to you as a friend.
More.
As a brother.
lf that machine can do what you say it can, destroy it.
Destroy it before it destroys you!
Don' t let me keep you.
We thought we' d stay home with the baby.
Why not come home with me?
You haven' t seen Jamey for a while.
I' m sorry, I can' t.
What' s stopping you?
Have it your way, George.
Will you promise you' il not go out of the house tonight?
I promise I won' t walk out the door.
I' m sorry.
- Come over to dinner Friday.
Bring the others with you.
- As you say, George.
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year, David.
- Having supper in tonight, sir?
- I don' t think so.
Why don' t you go and celebrate?
Thanks, but if you don' t need me, I' il turn in earlier, if I can.
- Good night.
Mrs. Watchett, I invited Mr. Filby and the others to dinner Friday.
Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett.
At first, I pushed the lever forward very slightly...... and the laboratory grew faint around me.
I stopped.
No change.
Everything exactly as before.
No!
The clock said 6: 31 when I started, and now it was... 8: 09?
And the candle, shorter by inches.
Yet by my watch, which was with me, only a few seconds had passed.
The hours speeding across my sundial.
Flowers closing their eyes for the night.
It was wonderful!
Changes that normally took hours took seconds.
Yet I was traveling very slowly.
What if I went faster?
It became intoxicating.
I gained experience with it.
Then go ahead a year or two.
I was able to see the changing world in a series of glimpses.
That' s a dress?
This was intriguing.
I began to grow very fond of that mannequin.
Maybe because, like me, she didn 't age.
Thirteen years passed.
Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen....
Suddenly the light was gone.
What had happened?
In the year 1917, I stopped.
Filby!
You look rather silly without your mustache.
- Were you addressing me, sir?
- It' s George!
You' re confusing me with my father.
There was quite a resemblance.
I' m James Filby.
"Was"?
- Were you a friend of Father' s?
- Yes.
Yes, I' ve been away.
He was killed in the war.
A year ago.
I' m so sorry.
- And the gentleman across the street?
- Oh, the inventor chap?
He disappeared around the turn of the century.
lf you' re interested in that house, you can' t buy it.
- You can' t even get inside.
- Why?
People hereabouts think it' s haunted, but....
Who are you, sir?
Just a stranger who once knew your father.
Have you been at the front?
Front?
What front?
The war, of course.
What war?
Good heavens!
You don' t know we' ve been at war with Germany since 1 91 4?
I thought you' d just returned from France.
Or perhaps....
Perhaps some tea might make you feel better.
Won' t you come in?
No, thank you.
Are you sure you' re all right?
Yes, I' m quite all right.
Then goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, Jamey.
In 1940, I began to be buffeted from side to side.
I first thought the machine had a mechanical defect.
The last time I had stopped was in 1917, 23 years ago.
The war was still waging.
Now in the air with flying machines.
Then I realized the truth.
This was a new war.
I decided to push into time and see the outcome of this.
My house was hit!
The flames shot up.
Instantly, my home was gone.
I was in the open air.
The years rolled by, everything unfamiliar.
Except the smile of my never- aging friend.
What was this?
Weird sounds all around.
What could it be?
My curiosity compelled me to stop.
I was soon to find out I wasn 't.
Keep it moving!
Shove it on!
Come on, into the shelter.
Come on, young man!
Come on!
- Filby?
- Didn' t you hear the siren?
- The horrible screeching?
- Now, come along.
I' ve got to talk.
This is fantastic!
Your store is magnificent!
The achievements!
- The gigantic strides man has taken!
- Come along, young man!
The mushrooms will be sprouting!
Mushrooms?
You look familiar.
Haven' t we met somewhere before?
lndeed we have, Mr. Filby.
Right there.
Many years ago.
I was sure of that.
But the exact time escapes me.
It was two wars ago.
1 91 7.
Now I recall.
But no....
No, that' s impossible!
You haven' t changed.
You' re not a day older.
And your clothes!
Don' t worry, Filby.
It' il take time to explain, but --
That' s the last alert!
Hurry!
Hurry!
- Listen, this is important.
- Look!
An atomic satellite, zeroing in.
That' s important.
- But I' ve got to talk to you!
- Come on!
Hurry!
Hide till the all clear!
But, Filby, I' ve got to talk to you!
The labor of centuries, gone in an instant.
The molten rock cooled.
Darkness.
Darkness for centuries.
The centuries rolled by.
I was free again!
Thousands of centuries passed but the Earth stayed green.
There was no winter, no wars.
Had man learned to control both the elements and himself?
I had to stop and find out.
But I' d stopped too fast.
Magnificent!
Beautiful flowers everywhere!
Natural splendor beyond compare.
The whole landscape a garden without any weeds or briars.
Trees and vines laden with fruit of strange shapes and colors.
Nature tamed completely...... and more bountiful than ever!
At last I' d found a paradise.
But it would be no paradise if it was mine alone.
Unrepaired for centuries.
Maybe unlived- in for as long.
Anybody here?
So this is man 's future: to bask in the sun, bathe in the streams...... and eat the fruits of the Earth, work and hardship forgotten.
Well, and why not?
Don' t just sit there!
Help her!
Are you all right?
Thank you.
- Why did you?
- Why did I what?
Come after me.
Sit down.
I did it to save your life.
That doesn' t seem to mean much to you, or anybody else.
It doesn' t.
Twenty of your friends were watching you drown.
Not one lifted a finger to save you.
That' s a very curious attitude.
Aren' t you interested in who I am?
Where I come from?
Should I be?
Take me to somebody a little older.
There is no one older.
Do you mean nobody ages in this land of yours?
- Weena.
How do you spell it?
- Spell, write.
Look.
- What are your people called?
Come.
We must go now.
- It' s getting dark.
I don' t mind telling you, I' m quite hungry.
I' ve come a long, long way.
ln my time, a berry that size...... would' ve been big news all over the world.
Excuse me, sir.
Sir?
Perhaps curiosity has died.
Perhaps...... courtesy too, but I' ve come far and I' d like to know things.
Why?
Such as:
What kind of government rules your world?
We have no government.
Laws?
There are no laws.
Where do you get food and clothing?
No.
Where does that come from?
- It grows.
It always grows.
Well, unless you....
You ask many questions.
I wish to learn.
I want to learn about your civilization.
Do you have books?
Books?
- Yes, we have books.
- Wonderful!
I can learn about you from books.
They' il tell me what I want to know.
Could I see the books?
Yes, they do tell me all about you.
What have you done?
A million years of sensitive men dying for their dreams.
For what?!
So you can swim and dance...
You!
All of you!
I' m going back!
But at least I' il die among men!
- Weena, what are you doing?
- I came to warn you.
- How do you open that panel?
- No one can.
Only the Morlocks.
Who are the Morlocks?
They give us our food and clothes.
We must obey.
Why' d they take my machine?
You' ve got to tell me!
You are a child, aren' t you?
- Please, let us go.
My machine is inside.
I must find a way to get it out.
- No, you mustn' t.
Where are you from?
As a matter of fact, I' m from right here.
You see there?
Up to those panels was my laboratory.
Beyond them was where my garden used to be.
Right there.
That was my library.
Where I once sat talking with friends about...... the time machine.
You know, Weena...
... l' d hoped to learn such a great deal.
lnstead, I find vegetables.
Are you all right?
- Was that a Morlock?
Don' t you worry.
The fire seems to keep them away.
What are you doing?
Why did you put your hand there?
I never saw it before.
No knowledge of fire.
No books.
I' m terribly sorry.
But, you know, Weena....
You were safe inside your house, yet came out to warn me.
And you have that quality.
So do all your people.
It just needs someone to reawaken it.
I' d like to try, if you' il let me.
Will you?
I do not understand...
... but I believe you.
That' s as good a start as any.
Try to tell me.
The Morlocks -- Who or what are they?
Are they animals or people?
Well, what about yourself?
Don' t your people ever speak of the past?
There is no past.
Well, do they ever wonder about the future?
There is no future.
The past...... man' s past...
... is mainly a grim struggle for survival.
I refuse to believe it' s dead and gone.
We' ve had dark ages before.
This is just another one.
All it needs is someone to show you the way out.
My efforts to open the panel were fruitless.
Listen.
Do you hear that?
Machines?
- No, Morlocks.
Those animals run machines?
They are Morlocks.
- Have you ever seen the machines?
- No, only heard of them.
- Who told you?
- The rings.
- What sort of rings?
- Rings that talk.
Could you show me these rings?
Come, this way.
- These are the talking rings?
- Yes.
They speak?
Of what?
Make it talk.
Now in its 326th year, the war between the East and West...... has at last come to an end.
There' s nothing to fight with and few left to fight.
The atmosphere has become so polluted with germs...... that it can no longer be breathed.
There is no place left that is immune.
The last factory for the manufacture of oxygen has been destroyed.
Stockpiles are rapidly diminishing...... and when they are gone, we must die.
My name is of no consequence.
The rest of us decided to take our chances in the sunlight...... small as those chances might be.
By some awful quirk of fate...... the Morlocks became the masters and the Eloi their servants.
Which explained why there were no older people.
I knew I must go below.
It was the only way to reach my machine...... and discover what happened to the older people.
Don' t go!
- You won' t come back!
Answer me!
Where are you?
What' s happening?
What' s happening?
What' s the matter with you all?
Weena, stop!
Stop!
What happens to them?
Don' t stand there like fatted cattle!
Will you answer me?
- What is wrong?
- Nothing is wrong.
It is all clear.
- What do you mean, all clear?
- All clear.
ln the mid- 1 900s, the bombs, the people calling out, "All clear!"
No!
That' s gone!
That' s passed!
There' s no more flying machines!
No bombs!
No more wars!
The rings have told us that story.
But you didn' t listen!
You didn' t learn!
It was ages ago that men were taught to hide when the sirens blew...... to run from death, but it' s over!
Those men and those who slaughtered them are dead!
But there is nothing to fear.
It is all clear.
What about the ones who went below?
How will they come back?
They never come back.
- Nobody can bring them back.
- You can try.
You can try!
Won' t even one of you try?!
Well, I' il try!
So this was the destiny of the Eloi.
They were being bred by the Morlocks...... who had degenerated into the lowest form of human life:
Cannibalism!
Wake up!
All of you!
Give me something to burn.
It' s my last match.
Get up the stairs!
That' s the way out!
Get the torch!
Get up the steps!
Hurry up!
All the wood!
That' s fine.
Come on, throw it down!
All the deadwood!
Throw it down!
Do the same to the other wells!
All the wood down the wells!
All right, to the river!
Back to the river!
All right, let' s go!
Another night was coming, but this night no Eloi needed to fear.
The underworld of the Morlocks was gone...... and so was the life of leisure for the Eloi.
But then what of me?
I was imprisoned in a world...... in which Ijust did not belong.
Are you sorry?
- Sorry?
Sorry for what?
- That you have to stay?
Yes.
I could tell so much to the people of my time.
I' d let them know...... about the sorrow and happiness that the future holds.
Maybe they could learn from it.
Or could they?
- You don' t want to stay, do you?
- It isn' t that.
It' s just that I don' t fit here any more than you would in my time.
I would love to see your time.
You wouldn' t be very happy there.
Do you have someone there?
Someone like me?
No one like you.
I have friends who will miss me, of course.
I' m probably late already.
Women?
No.
There is one woman.
She looks after my house for me.
She' s 62 years old and all wrinkled.
- Who?
- Up.
Up how?
I don' t know.
Kind of...... up, like that.
Show me!
Would I be pretty?
Yes, you would.
Very pretty.
I wish we could go back to my time.
Or even before that, when the world was young.
- We could be so very happy.
- Look!
My machine!
Come on, Weena!
I was going the wrong way!
Back!
I had to go back!
It' s the most ridiculous story I' ve ever heard.
Preposterous!
George, you always could tell a good yarn.
You' re a truly great inventor, George.
Truthfully, George, where have you been the past week?
Don' t ask such questions.
I can understand your doubt.
Take it as a lie if you wish.
I scarcely believe it myself, now that I' m back.
David, there' s the flower Weena gave me.
A present for you.
Time to go, Bridewell.
- Good night, George.
Good night, George.
You look exhausted.
You really should get some rest.
Good night.
It' s grand having you back.
Goodbye, David.
Thanks for being such a good friend.
Always.
What do you think, Filby?
One thing is certain.
That flower couldn' t bloom in the wintertime.
You don' t really believe that story?
Good night.
Go on, driver.
- Mr. Filby, what --?
- He' s gone!
Why, look!
You see the imprint?
The Morlocks moved it.
They dragged it across the lawn...... right into the sphinx.
Right there.
Weena was standing here when he last saw her.
Right here!
The same space in a different time.
- Right where he left her.
It' s not like George to return empty- handed.
Nothing.
- Which three books?
I don' t know. ls it important?
I suppose not.
Only...... which three would you have taken?
Do you think he' il ever return?
One cannot choose but wonder.
You see, he has all the time in the world.

We went into the bathroom and..., zero.
I want you to go back to your bathroom.
Oky, start turning left.

A mirror.

She' s suppose to meet him at Cafe Micheele at 1 pm.
What makes sure she does?
I' m here to meet someone, Michael Jennings.

Sit at the table over there,
And sit backward to the window.
Michael, you' re allright.
I thought I' il never see you again.

No, I' m sorry.
We can' t go in.

I don' t know what to say.

You suppose to give that to me.
We' il be together.
Michael, I love you.
- What' s my favorite baseball team?
- What?
Now we' re gonna leave.
Hold.

- You might?
Look for BMW.
You got to be joking.

It isn' t a car.
Look, I just trust you okay, okay?
Okay.
Got it.
I dropped the envelope!
- I' il come back to get you.
Let' s get out of here.
Take this down.
Hey.

We know what' s going on.
Let' s us bring you a way.
He' s heading for the cannal...
Do you think Jennings foresaw that?
Brought for you, anyway.

You might need them.

You don' t remember me, do you?
This' s for you.
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you,
I' m sorry, I' m sorry.
I still don' t remember.
Do you say he sent himself a different personal item...
Once it' s selected and after using the machine, nothing security will reflect.
Everyday thinks combine to the power of foresight...... transformed Michael from an engineer...... to an escaped artist.
I don' t know...
Micheal, are you okay?
Why?
... what you saw... but I remember few weeks ago...... you came back for me to the lab and you were pale.
You asked me a strange question.
What?
lf I knew it won' t work out for you, Mic, before we were together...... would I' ve done it?
What did you say?
I won' t trade our time for anything.
... besides, the best things in life have mistakes.
What?
Look, they told me I' ve signed 20 items...... but there' s only 19.
I don' t understand.
What' re the special of these?
Michael, look at this pictures
Look at the last one.
Oh, my God.
That' s the future.
... a war...
We may happen.
People control our life completely.
My Godness, I see the future is destroyed.
... they have no future.
It takes away history, it takes away home.
I' ve to destroyed the machine.
It' s impossible.
There got hundred of guards.
I would not have given up three years we have it together...... l' m absolutely sure I can get this thing work.
- Okay, so how do we get in?
- We don' t.
You say everything happens for a reason.
And that includes me being here.
So, come on.
Another day the most.
I don' t have anymore place to look.
I thought you were smart, Stephen.
Hey, Jennings won' t be finding here so fast.
He doesn' t know where to look.
He could be anyway by now.
Except -- he' s not running away.
Look at the....
It' s a security pass.
He' s going back.
... Put somebody on the campus.
I want that machine.
Jennings and the girl were spotted.
What you want me to do?
Nothing.
All our detectives at 4th floor are out at the same time.
Get down to the hall for a...
When he fix the machine, take him.

This door shouldn' t be opened.
There' s something wrong.
They' re expecting us.
Close the door behind.
He' s in.
Confirm.
He' s in.
Quick.... he check the machine, let' s go...
I thought we were going to wait for him to come out?
I can' t wait.... Jennings or the machine,
I don' t care as long as one of them.... Let' s go.
This' il do.
Watch out.
Wait, wait.
What' re you doing?
Smashing the lock.
Hold a second.
You can' t just smash the thing.
You' re still able to get it.
We got to...
Let' s go.
Let' s take look to the future...... before we destroy this thing.
I think the machine won' t agaisnt me, right?
And you can fix it, right?
We don' t need this, okay?
It' s dangerous with that thing.... something to help you to find that?
Crossword?
This, 12 down.
May be it' s a circuit area.
Take him.
Okay, corridor 3, sub level A.
Allright, I' il put this thing into a good use one last time.
Let' s get our hands here.
That' s in the lab.
Okay, I' il change my future before I destroy this thing.
I can do it again.
We don' t have anymore time, we got to destroy it...
Reprogram the door to get in to the lab, please.
He must have done something to the controller.
How are we going to get out of here, Michael?
I don' t know.
What' re you doing?
It' s liquid hydrogen.
It' s used to cool the machine.
Come on!
You see, you... too soon.
They went out to the...
Spread and find them.
Freeze!
Look out!
Seal off... to the left.
All right, Jennings.
I want to see what you' re gonna to do.

Looks like Michael...
Just make sure he makes it.

lf you love me, if you care about me, go!
Have a good life.
Remember me.
Jimmy!
You want to kill me?
Now do it yourself!
Come get me!
How you wish?
You need yourself to blame.
You' re a liar.
You can' t change your fate, Mic.
You gonna die today.
Maybe,
Which you' re not going to kill me.
That' s right, Mic.
I' ve seen the future.
You think you can change your fate, Mic?
I' m the future, Mic.
We... the machine...... falls in the wrong hands.
Come on.
Don' t blame me.
... Michael... have no memory wipe,
He saw something he didn' t like.
He wants to suddenly stop the program.
Look at this way, he didn' t change the future, Michael.
He fall in love with you
You both still can be friends...... like this.
It wasn' t...
You give up so easy?
Don' t you... heve second chances?
I tell you I trust it.
I do.
Go, go go.
The explosion destroyed everything.
We still don' t get the machine, do we?
You saw Jennings?
What... are you thinking?... in nursery,... in plants.
You didn' t tell me you have the great thought.
Too bad, I' m looking for partner... a company.
Really?
- For what?
- For save cost.
Don' t you think a guy... someone who wants to help you to change?
- Okay.
- Good.
So how is it end for, Michael?
We must think of the future.
I don' t know.
I can like it that way.
But I do know one thing.
What' s that?
I never want to forget anything I ever have.
Part it up, part it up.
The bird man' s coming.
