Harry
Professor, sir... your bird there was nothing I could do he just caught fire oh, about time, too he' s been looking dreadful for days pity, you had to see him on a Burning Day
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. they burst into flame when it is time for them to die and they are. reborn from the ashes
oh, that' s Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.
They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers
listen
Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn' t harry
Hagrid in fact I prepare to swear it in front of the Ministry of Magic
Hagrid! relax
I do not think that Harry attacked any one. of course you don' t oh,.. oh, great!... then...
I' il just wait outside you don' t think it was me, Professor? no, Harry, I do not think it was you but I must ask you is there something you wish to tell me?
no sir very well, then, off you go
everything is set, we just need a bit who you change into Crabbe and Goyle we also need to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle _BAR_can' t burst in on us while we' re interrogating Malfoy how?
I' ve got it all worked out
Whose hair are you ripping out then?
I 've alreaday got mine
Millicent Bulstrode in Slytherin
I got this off her robes
I am going to check on the polyjuice potion make sure Crabbe and Goyle find these
Ron, maybe, maybe I should do it yeah, right
MAGADlMIGOSA
good cool

add the hairs erh... essence of Crabbe cheers
I think I am gonna be sick me too
Harry?
Ron? bloody hell we still sound like ourselves you need sound more like Grabbe bloody hell excellent but where is Hermione
Hermione, are you ok? just go you' re wasting time come on
I think Slytherin common room is this way excuse me what are you doing down....
I mean, what are you doing down here?
I happen to be a school prefect you on the other hand have no bussiness wondering the corridors at this time of night what' s your name again? eh, I' m....
Crabbe and Goyle where have you two been? pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? why are you wearing glasses?
I..., I am reading reading?
I didn' t know you could read what are you doing down here, Weasley? mind your attitude, Malfoy
well, sit down you never know that Weasleys were pure- bloods the way they behave they are emmbassing the wizarding world, all of them what' s wrong with you?
Crabbe stomachach
You know, I' m surprised the Daily Prophet _BAR_hasn' t done any report of all these attacks
I suppose Dumbledore' s trying to hush it all up.
Father' s always said Dumbledore was the worst thing _BAR_that' s ever happened to this place. you' re wrong
what? you think some one here is worse than Dumbledore? well, do you?
Harry Potter?
And people actually think he' s heir Slytherin!
but then you must have some idea who is behind it all you know I don' t, Goyle
I told you yesterday how many times do I have to tell you? is this yours?
but my father did say this it' s been 50 years since the chamber was opened he wouldn' t tell me who opened it only they were spelled the last time the chamber of secret was opened a mudblood died so it' s only matter of time before one of them' s killed this time as to me
I hope it' s Granger what' s the matter with you two you' re acting very odd it' s his stomachache calm down scar
hey, where are you going? that was close
Hermione, come on, we' ve got loads to tell you go away wait you' il see it' s awful
Hermione, are you ok?
look at your tail
we spoke to Hermione she' il sleep in hospital for a few days when she stop coughing out furballs
what' s this?
yark, looks like Moaning Myrtle flooded the bathroom
Why would I throw something at you? don' t ask me
But it can' t hurt you if someone throws something at you
I mean, it' d just go right through you so!! Let' s all throw books at Myrtle, because she can' t feel it!
Ten points if you can get it through her stomach! _BAR_Fifty points if it goes through her head!
I didn' t see them
Tom Maryold Riddle
my name is Harry Potter
"Hello, Harry Potter, my name is Tom Riddle"

"let me take you back fifty years ago"
"13th June"
excuse me could you tell me what' s going on here? are you Tom Riddle?
Hello, can you hear me?
"Riddle" up
Professor Dumbledore
I am afraid, they are, Tom, they are true well this school as well
I am afraid headmaster Dipper may have no choice sir, if it all stoped the person who' s responsible was caught is there something you wish to tell me?
no sir nothing very well then off you go goodnight, sir
what' s going on there? evening, Hagrid
The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing _BAR_that killed their daughter is slaughtered...... it wasn' t him
Stand aside, Hagrid no SESYTENOPEYlDE ORONYlEXRTlN
Aragog!
Aragog!
I have you warned for this, Hagrid you would be expelled
Hagrid
it was Hagrid
Hagrid opened the chamber of secret 50 years ago it can' t be Hagrid, just can' t be we don' t even know this Tom Riddle he sound like a dirty rotten snitch to me the monster had killed somebody, Ron what if he has done?
Hello, Hagrid.
Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose _BAR_in the castle lately? mad and hairy? you wouldn' t be talking about me, now, would you? no
what' s that you got, Hagrid? oh, it' s Flesh- Eatin 'Slug Repellent for the mandrake, you know according to proffessor Sprout, they still gonna need bit grown- up to do, _BAR_but once their acne' s been cleared up, we' il be able to chop them up, _BAR_stew them, and then we' il get those people down at hospital unpetrified in meantime, you know, you three, best look after yourselves all right?
hello, Nevill
Harry, I don' t who did it, but you' d be better come come on
it has to be a Gryffindor nobody else know our password unless he wasn' t a student whoever he was, he must be looking something he found it
Tom Riddle' s diary is gone oh, well, listen up we play our game, Hufflepuff doesn' t stand a chance stronger, quicker, and smarter not to mention they' re deadly scared that_BAR_Harry' il petrify any one near him oh, that too professor McGonagall this match has been cancelled you can' t cancell quidditch silence, wood you and your teammates will go to Gryffindor tower, now
Potter you and I will find Mr. Weasley there are someting the both of you' il have to see
I warn you
This could be a bit of a shock
Hermione! she was found near the library alone with this does it mean anything to either of you? no
I should tell you this unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught it is likely the school will be closed
we got to talk to Hagrid, Ron
I think it' s the time to get my dad' s old cloak again
I' ve being expecting..., and it doesn' t matter, come on in just made a pot of tea
Hagrid, are you ok?
look, we have to ask you something do you know who' s opened the chamber of secrets?
what you have to understand about that is quick, under the cloak don' t say a word, quiet, both of you
proffessor Dumbledor, sir good evening, Hagrid
I wonder, could we?.. of course, come in come in that' s dad' s boss
Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic!
Bad business, Hagrid, Very bad business.
Had to come. three attacks on Muggle- borns.
Things' ve gone far enough.
I never, You know I never, Professor
I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence
Albus Look,
Hagrid' s record is against him.
Not Azkaban prison?
I am afraid we have no choice, Hagrid already here, Fudge, good what are you doing here? get out of my house believe me, I absolutely have no pleasure at all being inside your - er you call this a house?
I simply called at the school and_BAR_was told that the headmaster was here. and what exactly is it that you want with me?
the other governors and I desided _BAR_it' s time for you to step aside.
This is an Order of Suspension
you' il find all twelve signatures on it.
I' m afraid we feel you' re losing your touch.
well, with all those attacks there' il be no Muggle- borns left at Hogwarts
Calm yourself, Hagrid
I will of course step aside however you will find the help will always be given to Hogwarts to those who ask for it
any more sentiments? shall we?
come, Hagrid well if if anybody was looking some stuff that all they have to do would be to follow the spiders yeah, that will lead them right that' s all I have to say oh, well, some one need to feed Fang when I am away good boy
Hagrid is right
look come on come on, Fang
come on what? you heard what Hagrid said follow the spiders they' re heading to the dark forest why spiders why can' t we follow the butterflies?
Harry, I don' t like this
Harry, I don' t like it at all
can we go back now? come on
who is it? don' t panic
Hagrid, is that you? we are friends of Hagrid' s
and you you are Aragog, aren' t you? yes
Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before he is in trouble, up in the school, for the punish of attacks they think it' s Hagrid they think he open the chamber of secrets they think he opened the chamber of secrets like before that' s a lie
Hagrid' d never opened the chamber of the secrets then, you are not the monster no the monster was born in the castle
I never saw any part of the castle with the books in which Hagrid kept me the girl was discovered in bathroom when I was accused, Hagrid brought me here
Harry what?
well, thank you we' il just go go
I think not
My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command.
But I can not deny them fresh meat, _BAR_ when it wanders so willingly into our midst. goodbye friends of Hagrid can we go back now?
know any spells? one but it' s not powerful enough for all of them where is Hermione when you need her
let' s go
RONlEGEZlMElY
glad we' re out there
ERMONlAEXPAY
thanks for that don' t mention it
get out of here now come on come on, a little faster
go, go
get us in the air the flying gear is jammed come on oh, I am trying
follow the spiders follow the spiders if Hagrid ever get out of Azkaban, I will kill him
I mean what was the point of sending us in there what we found out? we know one thing
Hagrid' d never opened the chamber of secrets he was innocent
I wish you were here, Hermione we need you now more than ever
what' s that?
Ron this why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked come on of many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land none is more more deadly than the Basilisk capable of living for hundreds of years instant death awaits any who meets this giantic serpent' s eyes
Spiders flee before it
Ron, this is it the monster in chamber of secrets is a basilisk that' s why I can hear its speak it' s a snake but if it kills by looking people in the eye why is it no one' s died?
because no one did look in the eye not directly at least
Colin saw it through his camera
Justin Justin must' ve seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick!
Nick got the full blast of it, _BAR_ but he is a ghost, he couldn' t die again and Hermione had the mirror
I' m pretty sure she didn' t have a camera or mirror, Harry the water that was the water on the floor that night she only saw the Basilisk' s reflection
Someone would' ve seen it...
Hermione thought that too pipes it' s using the plumbing remmeber what Aragog said: about that girl 50 years ago? she died in the bathroom what if she' d never left?
Moaning Myrtle?
All students to return to their House dormitories at once.
All teachers return to second floor corrider.
Immediately
as you can see the heir of Slytherin has left another message the worst fear has been realized, _BAR_a student has been taken by the monster into the chamber itself students must be sent to home
Weren' t you saying just last night that you' ve known all along _BAR_where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
that' s settled we will leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy your skills, after all, are legend very well
I' il just be in my office, getting... getting ready
who is it the monster has taken another?
Ginny Weasley
her Skeleton will lie in the chamber forever
Ginny...
Lockhart maybe useless, but if He' s going to try and get into the Chamber. at least we can tell him what we know professor, we have some information for you are you going somewhere? oh, yes, eh.. urgent call, unavoidable, got to go what about my sister? as for that, most unfortunate no one regrets more than I you are the defense against the dark art teacher you can' t go now
I must say, when I took the job, _BAR_there was nothing in the job description about the... you are running away?
After all that stuff you did in your books
Books can be misleading you wrote them my dear boy, do you use your common sense?
My books wouldn' t have sold half as well _BAR_if people didn' t think I' d done all those things you are a fraud you' ve just been taking credit for other wizards have done? so anything you can do? yes now you mentioned it
I, eh, I am 'eh, going to have to do the thing to you don' t even think about it
oh, who' s there? oh, hello, Harry what do you want? to ask you how you died?
I was crying then I heard somebody come in who was it, Myrtle?
I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes. over there by that sink
this is it this is it, Ron, _BAR_I think this is the entrance of chamber of secrets say something
Harry, say something in Parseltongue.
excellent, Harry ha, good work, then, I' il just be... there is no need for me to stay
you first no boys, what good it will do? better you than us
you sure you don' t want to test it first?
let' s go oh, Harry if you die down there, you are welcome to share my toilet eh, thanks, Myrtle
now, remmeber any signs of movement, close your eyes straight away go on this way
I am sure this must be 60 feet long hard to a liar this one
adventure ends here, boys but don' t fright the world will know our story but however it' s too late to save the girl how you two tragically lost your minds _BAR_at the sight of her mangled body so, you first, Mr. Potter say goodbye to your memories Obliviate!
Harry Harry
Ron
Hello who are you?
Really and who am I?
Lockhart' s memory charm backfired he hasn' t got clue who he is it' s an odd sort of place, isn' t it?
I' il go and find Ginny ok
Ginny, oh, please don' t be dead wake up, wake up, please wake up she won' t wake
Tom
Tom Riddle? what do you mean she won' t wake? she is not... she' s still alive but only just are you a ghost? a memory, reserved in a diary for 50 years she' s cold as ice
It won' t come until it is called give me my wand, Tom
I am afraid I can' t do that, Harry, you see as poor Ginny growes weaker
I grow stronger yes, Harry, _BAR_it was Ginny Weasley who opened the chamber of secrets no, she couldn' t, she wouldn' t it was Ginny who set the Basilisk on mudblood and Filch' s cat
Ginny wrote the frighten messages on the walls why? because I told her to you' il find that I can be very persusive not that Ginny knew what she was doing, she was shall we say, in a kind of trance still, the power of diary began to scare her she tried to dispose it in girl' s bathroom and then you should find it, but you the very person I was most anxious to meet why did you want to meet me?
I knew it wouldn' t be safe to open the chamber again _BAR_while I was still at school so I desided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen- year- old self in its pages so that one day
How did you escape with nothing but a scar while Lord Voldemort' s powers were destroyed?
Why do you care how I escaped? _BAR_Voldemort was after your time......
Voldemort is my past, present, and future
I fashioned myself a new name a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!
Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
Dumbledore' s been driven out of this castle _BAR_by the mere memory of me! he would never be gone. not as long as those remain loyal to him
Fawkes?
so this is what Dumbledore sends his defender!
A songbird and an old hat!
Let' s match the powers of Lord Voldemort,
Heir of Salazar Slytherin against the famous Harry Potter
so, I have asks, Potter, no one will save you
Potter, it only obeys me
no your bird may have blinded Basilisk but it can still hear you
yes, Potter the process is nearly complete in a few minutes
Ginny Weasley will be dead and I will cease to be a memory
Lord Voldemort will return very much alive
Ginny
remarkable, isn' t it? how quickly the venom of Basilisk can penetrate the body
I guess you have a little more than a minute to live you will be with your dear mudblood mother, soon, Harry
funny the damage a silly little book can do especially in the hands of a silly little girl what are you doing? stop no
Ginny
I didn' t mean to
Riddle made me
Don' t worry
Ginny you need to get yourself out follow the chamber, and you will find Ron
I just wasn' t quick enough
Phoenix tears have healing powers thanks it' s all right, Ginny it' s over it' s just memory amazing this is just like magic
you both realized, of course in the past few hours you' ve broken perhaps a dozen school rules yes, sir there are sufficient evidence to have you expelled yes, sir yes, sir therefore it is only fitting that you will both receive special awards _BAR_for services to the school
I believe we want our gamekeeper back
Harry
I see, well you can speak Parseltongue,?
Harry, why? because
Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue if I am not mistaken, Harry he transferred some of his powers to you _BAR_the night he gave you that scar.
Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me? not intentionally but yes so the sorting hat was right
Exactly it makes you different from Voldemort it is not our abilities that show what we truly are it is our choices if you want proof why you belong to Gryffindor and I suggest you look more closely at this
Godric Gryffindor it' d take a true Gryffindor to pull out of that hat
Dobby, so, this is your master your family you serve is Malfoy' s
I will deal with you later
out of my way
Potter so, it is true you have returned when the governors learned Arthur Weasley' s daughter_BAR_ was taken into Chamber, they saw fit to sending me back ridiculars curiously, Lucius
Several among them are under the impression that you would curse their families if they didn' t want to agree to suspend me in the first place. how dare you? beg your pardon my sole concern has always been, and will always be the welfare of school and of course its students
the culprit has been identified
I would assume? oh, yes and who was it?
Voldemort only this time he chosed to act through somebody else by means of this
I see fortuanately our young Mr. Potter discovered it one hopes that no more _BAR_of Lord Voldemore' s old school things should find their way into innocent hands, the consequence for the one responsible would be severe well, let' s just hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day don' t worry
Dumbledore come Dobby, we leave here
sir, I wonder if I could have that
Mr. Malfoy
Mr. Malfoy
I think you do, sir
why don' t you prove it?
come, Dobby open it
I didn' t master has presented Dobby with cloth
Dobby is free
you lost me my servant!
you shall not harm Harry Potter
you parents would middle some fools too mark my words,
Potter one day soon, you are going to be the same, stick it
Harry Potter freed Dobby
How can dobby ever repay him? just promise me something anything Sir... never try to save my life again
welcome back, Sir Nicholus thank you good evening, sir Nicholus good evening good to see you, sir Nicholus thank you hello
Hermione welcome back thanks sir Nicholus
Harry it' s Hermione
eh.... eh... well! welcome back, Hermione it' s good to be back congratulations
I can' t believe you solved it well, we had loads of help from you we couldn' t have done it without you thanks could I have your attention please
let us have a round of applause for proffessor Sprout
Madam Pomfrey whose mandrake juices' s been sowed successfully _BAR_and ministered to all who had been petrified
also, in the light of recent events as a school treat all exams have been cancelled
I am late
the owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused some bloody bird called Eroll
I just like to say, thanks
it' s not Hogwarts without you, Hagrid
Why not call it the Pecu?
Or the Nipia one?
I' m just saying how do we know it' s an ice age?
Because of all the ices!
Well, things just got a little peculiar.
Help!
Help!
The berg is moving.
No "but".
You can play later.
Okay.
Come on, guys.
Sally, where' s Eddie?
He said something about being on a verge of a revolutionary breakthrough.
Really?
I' m flying!
Some breakthrough.
Look out!
A mammoth is on its way.
Hey, do the world a favour!
Move your issue off the road!
If my trunk was that small, I wouldn' t draw attention to myself, pal.
Give me a break.
We' ve been wandering with our babies.
Follow the crowd.
It' il be quieter when you' re gone.
Come on.
I' m up, I' m up!
Rise n shine, everybody.
Zeke?
Birdie?
Uncle Fungis?
Where is everybody?
We gonna miss the mi...
Migration.
They left without me.
They do this every year!
Why?
Doesn' t anyone love me?
Isn' t there anyone who cares about Sid the Sloth?
All right, I' il just go by myself.
Oh.
Hey, wait, buddy!
Tell me next time!
I can' t believe it.
Fresh wild greens.
Frank, where did you ever.
Go ahead, dig in.
A dandelion.
I thought the frost wipe them all out.
All but one.
This is definitely not been my day.
You know what I' m saying, buddy?
What a mess.
Hey, you rhinos have really tiny brains, do you know that?
It' s just a fact.
You probably don' t know what I' m talking about.
Must be the last one of season.
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.
He ruined our salad.
Oh, my mistake.
It' s my mistake.
Let me...
Oh.
What is this?
My goodness, they' re my favourite.
Hmm, delicious.
That' s a... good eating.
Don' t let me hog them all up.
Here, you have some.
Tasty, isn' t it?
Bon appétit.
Now.
Just pretend that I' m not here.
I wanna hit him full speed.
We' il have some fun with him.
Don' t let them impale me, please.
Get off me!
Come on, you' re making a scene.
We just take our free piñata and go, if you don' t mind.
Buddy, if not them today, it' s just someone else tomorrow.
I rather it not be today.
Look we' re gonna break your neck so you don' t feel a thing.
How' s that?
I thought rhinos are vegetarians.
An excellent point.
Shut up!
Who says we gonna eat him after we kill him?
Come on, move it.
You know, I don' t like animals who kill for pleasure.
Save it, for a mammal that cares.
Okay, look.
If either of you make it across that sink hole in front of you, you get the sloth.
That' s right, you losers.
You take a step and you' re dead.
- You' re bluffing, huh?
- Yeah, that was a bluff.
Go!
A dandelion?
What?
You have beautiful eyes.
Get off my face.
You and me, we make a great team.
What do you say we just head South together?
Yeah, jump on my back and relax the whole way.
- No.
Wait, aren' t you going South?
The changing season, migration instincts?
- Any of this ringing a bell?
- I guess not, bye.
Okay, thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.
Hey, you over grown weasel.
Wait till we get down there.
The whole South thing is way over rated.
The heat, the crowd.
This great.
You and me, two bachelors knocking about in the wild.
No, you just want a bodyguard so you don' t become somebody' s side dish.
You' re very strut mammoth.
Can you lead the way, Mr. Big Guy?
Manfred.
How about Manny the moody mammoth or nanny the...
Stop following me.
Okay, so you got it.
You won' t even know I' m here.
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.
Isn' t it nice if he' s joining us for breakfast?
It wouldn' t be breakfast without him.
And rag our skin to keep warm.
Don' t you think?
Let show that human what happen when he messed with Sabers.
We attack at dawn.
And Diego, bring me that baby.
If I' m gonna enjoy my revenge, I want it to be fresh.
That' s your shelter?
You' re a big guy.
You got a lot of wood.
I' m a little guy.
You only got half a stick.
Yeah, but with my little stick, and my highly evolved brain...
I' il shall create fire.
Fascinating.
We' il see if brains triumph over brawn tonight.
Hey, I think I saw a spark.
Any chance I can squeeze in there with you?
Isn' t there someone else you can annoy?
Friends?
Family?
Poison reptiles?
My family abandoned me.
They just kind of migrated without me.
You should see what they did last year.
They woke up early and they tied my hands and feet together.
They buried the cave door, and covered their tracks.
Who needs them anyway.
You have family?
Okay, you' re tired, I see.
We' il talk more in the morning.
Manfred?
Manfred.
Could you move over?
Manny!
That' s Diego, fall back!
Where' s the baby?
I lost it over the falls.
You lost it?
I want that baby, Diego.
I' il get it.
You better.
Unless you want to serve yourself as the replacement.
Meet us there.
It' d better be alive.
Let' s go!
And you pick this year off my shoulders.
If you gonna have a mating partner, at least pick a female with the same color palette, right?
And I thought, wow, he' s gonna go primal, you know what I' m saying?
If you find a mate in life, you should be loyal.
Get away from me.
Well, I think mate in life is stupid.
I mean there' s plenty of Sid to go around...
Manny?
He' s okay.
She' s gone.
Hey, Manny, are you forgetting something?
- No.
- But you just saved him.
You can' t leave him here.
Look, there' s smoke.
That' s his herd right up the hill.
We should return him.
Let' s get something straight.
There' s no "we".
There never was a "we".
Just up the hill.
Listen very carefully.
I' m not g- o- i- n- g.
Fine.
Be a jerk.
I' il take care of him.
Yeah, that' s good.
You take care of him?
This I gotta see.
I' il return you.
We don' t need that Manny.
You know we don' t.
You' re an embarrassment the nature, do you know that?
I' m fine!
I' m gonna die.
That thing is mine.
No, actually that thing belongs to us.
You two are an odd couple.
- There is no "us".
You can' t have one of your own so you want to adopt.
Look, I' m sorry to interrupt this.
But we gotta go.
I' m returning to his herd.
Oh, yeah.
Nice try, bucktooth.
- You' re calling me a liar?
I don' t like this cat.
He reads mind.
Name is Diego, friend.
And I' m not your friend.
Fine, Manfred.
If you' re looking for the humans, you' re wasting your time. they left this morning.
Thanks for the advice.
Now beat it.
All right, I' il help you bring it to its herd.
But promise me that you' d leave me alone after that.
Okay, deal.
- What' s your problem?
- You' re my problem.
That' s why you eat so much.
It' s hard to get fat on a diet.
I' m not fat.
It' s all this fur.
It makes me look puffy.
All right, yeah.
Fat hair.
But when you' re ready to talk, I' m here.
Just drop it on the ledge.
Shouldn' t we make sure they found him?
Good idea.
Wait.
Don' t spear me!
This is a problem.
Now what?
That' s perfect.
I told you they were gone.
Look who it is.
Don' t you have some poor defenseless animals to disembowel?
They couldn' t be far.
They went this way?
Or this way?
You don' t know much about tracking, do you?
I' m a sloth.
I see a tree, eat a leave, that' s my tracking.
You didn' t miss them by much.
It' s still green.
They head north 2 hours ago.
Still green.
They head north 2 hours ago.
You don' t need this aggravation.
I can track humans down faster than you can.
And you' re just a good citizen helping out, right?
I just know where the humans will go.
Glacier pass.
Everybody knows they have a settlement on the other side.
Unless you know how to track, you never gonna reach them before their pass closed up with snow.
Which should be like, tomorrow.
So you can give that baby to me or go get lost in the blizzard.
It' s your choice.
We' il return it to the human.
Big bad Tiggy Wiggy gets left behind.
Sid, Tiggy Wiggy is gonna lead the way.
Manny, can I talk to you for a second?
No.
The sooner we find the humans, the sooner I get rid of Mr. Stinky- drew- face.
And the baby too.
And when that day comes, I suggest you watch your back.
Cause I' il be chewing on it.
Human tracker, up front where I can see you.
You gotta make it stop.
I' ve eaten things that didn' t complain as much.
- Stop shouting at me.
- Just put it down.
Its nose is dry.
That means something is wrong with it.
Maybe we should lick it.
Just in case.
I' il do it.
You know, its wearing one of those baby thingies.
So if it poops, where does it go?
Humans are disgusting.
Okay, you.
Check for poop.
Why am I the poop checker?
Because returning it was your idea.
And because I' il pound you if you don' t.
What else?
I mean, my goodness.
All right, look out.
Watch out!
Stop waving it around!
Oh, I' m gonna slip!
It' s clean!
Got you!
Would you cut it out!
Hey, do that again.
He likes it.
That makes me feel better too.
Turn him towards me.
Where is the baby?
Stop it!
You' re scaring it!
I bet he' s hungry.
How about some milk?
- Not you, the baby.
I ain' t exactly doing it right now, pal.
You are a bit low on the food chain to be mouthing off, aren' t you?
Food!
Protect the Dodo way of life!
Prepare for ice age!
Ice age?
I' ve heard of these crack pots.
Intruders!
Don' t fall in.
If you do, you' il definately...
Intruders!
Burn and die.
Hey, can we have our melon back?
Junior is hungry and...
This is our private stock pile for ice age.
Sub- artic temperatures will force us underground for billions billions years.
So you got three melons?
If you weren' t smart enough to plan ahead, then doom on you.
Get away from me.
No!
Attack!
The melon!
There goes our last female.
The last melon!
Ahhh, Sid.
Now we gotta find more food.
Look at that.
Now to find a meal be fitting a conquering hero.
A foe?
Come on, you wanna a piece of me?
Bedtime.
The triumphant returns.
So full.
How about a good night kiss for you?
Shh.
It' s asleep.
I was talking to you.
Fine, I' il tuck myself in.
Good night.
All right.
All right.
Trying to relax.
All right.
What the...
Go ahead.
Slice me.
It' il be the last thing you' d ever do.
I' m working here, you wasted fur.
Fustrated, Diego?
Tracking down helpless infants too difficult for you?
What are you two doing here?
Yeah.
He said, come back with the baby, or don' t come back at all!
I have a message for Soto.
Tell him, I' m bringing the baby.
A mammoth.
Mammoth never travels alone.
This one does.
And I' m leading him to half peak.
Look at all that meat.
Let' s get him!
Not yet!
We need the whole pack to bring this mammoth down.
Get everyone ready.
Now!
Where is the baby?
You lost it?
Sid!
It' s so ugly.
But it' s adorable.
Hello, pumpkin.
Where did you find it?
The poor kid all alone in the wild.
Sabers were closing in on it.
So I just snatch it.
So brave.
Well, he needed me and I only wish I have one of my own.
Really?
I find it attactive in a male.
Who wouldn' t want a family, I always say.
Well, you know.
Cute kid, huh?
So I was saying, ladies...
What' s the matter with you?
Excuse me, ladies.
You just keep marinating and I' il be right back.
He' s not much to look at but it' s so hard to find a family guy.
Tell me about it.
All the sensitive ones get eaten.
No, please.
I beg you, I need him.
A good looking guy like you?
You say that but you don' t mean it.
No, seriously, look at you.
Those ladies, they don' t stand a chance.
You have a very cruel sense of humour.
Don' t let me cramp your style.
You' re the best.
- Without the baby.
- Manny, I need him.
So, ladies, where were we?
- Carl?
- Easy, Frank.
Pretty tail walks by, and suddenly he moves like a cheetah.
And that tiger.
Yeah, Mr. Great Tracker.
What am I?
Their wet nurse?
What are you looking at?
Look at you.
You gonna grow into a great predator, huh?
I don' t think so.
What do you got?
You got...
Iittle patched fur, no fangs, no claws.
Your foot is skin- wrap in mulish.
What so threatening about you?
Hey, is this some kind of petting zoo to you?
All right, wise guy.
You just started time out.
You think that' s funny?
How about this?
You' re a little snack for the owls.
I' m a little square to give you that.
Thank goodness.
Oh no, a tiger!
Where' s the baby?
He' s fine.
Manfred has him.
He got me!
Help...
Get away from me.
Over here.
No, Carl!
Wait a minute.
It' s dead, all right.
Carlo, where' s all the fun?
I hate to breaking their hearts like that.
All right, thanks.
You can put me down now.
Manny!
Guys, I thought we' re in a hurry.
And Diego spit that out, you don' t know where its been.
For a second, I actually thought you gonna eat me.
I don' t eat junk food.
Were you?
Wait up.
Wait up!
Can you wait a second, please?
Hey, fellows!
Thanks for waiting.
3, 2, 1.
Sure is faithful.
Don' t make me reach back there.
He started it.
I don' t care who started it.
I' il finish it.
It' d never last.
Hey, Manny.
Hey, Diego.
Hey, Sid.
You' re lost, aren' t you?
No, I know exactly where we are.
Ask him direction.
I don' t need direction.
Fine, I' il ask him.
Have you seen any human goes by here?
I love this thing.
Okay, three words.
First word, stamp.
Let me try.
- Good one, Manny.
Long teeth?
Great news.
I found a short cut.
I mean it' s faster that the long way around.
I know what a short cut is.
Or take the long way and miss them.
What do you take me for?
Hey guys check this out.
The tiger found a shortcut.
No thanks I chose life.
Then I suggest you take the shortcut.
Are you threatening me?
Move sloth!
Stick together it' s easy to get lost in here.
Fish.
I don' t want to keep track Of one baby.
I got you.
Tell the kid to be more careful.
Tigers.
It' s ok.
With their teeth.
Come on Sid.
Somebody pinch me.
Look!
This fat one looks just like you.
Look he is playing with his kid.
See that' s your problem.
That' s what mammoths are supposed to do.
Find a she- moth, have little baby mammoths...
- Sid.
- What?
Shut up.
Look at that.
How could I ever doubted you?
Did you hear that?
You are almost home.
My feet are sweating.
Do we have to get a newsflash everytime your body does something?
Just ignore him.
Seriously, my feet are really hot...
Tell me that was your stomach.
I' m sure its just thunder.
From under..,
Come on keep up with me.
I wonder if you' re moving.
I wish I' d jump like that.
Come on move faster.
Manny are you ok?
Anything.
What?
You are standing on my trunk.
You' re ok.
Why did you do that?
You' d have died trying, to save me.
That' s what you do in a herd.
We lookout for each other.
Well... thanks.
We' re the weirdest herd I' d ever seen.
I can' t wait to get my claws on that mammoth.
No one touches the mammoth until I get that baby.
Knock it off I am starving.
I told you to knock it off.
Save your energy.
Mammoths don' t go down easy.
There is only one way to do it.
First you have to force it into a corner.
Cut off its retreat.
Then go for throat.
We gotta get this kid out of the wind.
How much further?
What' re you doing?
I' m painting sloths on a map.
Why don' t you make him look realistic and draw him laying down.
Make him rounder.
I forgot how to laugh.
I am a genius.
Now you have to refer me as...
Lord of the flame.
Lord of the flame, your tail' s on fire.
Thank you.
From now on I' m gonna call you Diego.
Lord of you touch me and you are dead.
I am just kidding you little knuckle- head.
Look at this.
I don' t believe it...
Come here.
Come to uncle Sid.
No no this way.
No.
Ok.
Good job.
Keep practising.
Our little guy' s growing up.
Come on sleep time.
You know I never had a friend who' d risk his life for me.
Manny' s a good guy.
Yeah he is.
Well, good night.
What is your problem?
I' m freezing my tail off.
Hey Diego.
You frozen back there?
- Get down!
Get down and follow me.
What' s going on?
There is an ambush waiting for you.
What do you mean "ambush"?
You set us up.
It was my job, I was supposed to get the baby but...
You brought us home for dinner.
That' s it you' re out of the herd.
No you are not.
Not yet.
Listen I can help you.
Stay close Sid.
We can fight our way out.
You can' t.
Trust you?
Why in the world would we trust you?
Cos I am your only chance.
Hello ladies.
Look who decided to show up.
I was beginning to worry about you.
No need to worry.
In about 2 minutes you' il be satisfying your taste for revenge.
I see the sloth.
He got the baby.
Don' t give away your position until you see the mammoth.
He is the one we have to surprise.
You wanna maul something don' t just ache.
What are you waiting for?
I said wait for the mammoth.
Eat my powder.
It got a little frostbite.
Follow me.
We' il pick up Sid and get out of here while we can.
Let' s bring this mammoth down.
Where' s baby...
What are you doing?
Leave the mammoth alone.
I' il take you down first.
We did it.
We were some team, huh?
We' re still a team.
I am sorry I set you up.
You know me, I am too lazy to hold a grudge.
Knock it off.
You gotta be strong.
You have to take care of Manfred and Sid.
Especially Sid.
You' re a tiger.
What do you say?
Come on everything' s gonna be ok.
Listen.
If the humans get through the pass.
You' il never catch them.
You didn' t have to do that.
That' s what you do in a herd.
Forget about us, ok?
We won' t forget about you.
Where is the baby?
Come on Sid.
Let' s head south.
Save your breath Sid.
You' re alive.
9 lives baby.
You ok.
I' il kiss ya.
Welcome back partner want a lift?
No thanks I gotta save whatever dignity I got left.
Dignity has nothing to do with it.
But I' il take that lift.
Climb aboard.
March!
Either way.
Every night, the same dream.
The same strange planet.
But why?
What are they trying to tell you?
It has been 34 years since they arrived in this planet.
And now the days passes, the survivors forced to live in a barrier cities.
I have vowed to the end that fear.
I believe my dreams hold the key.
Will I be in time to save the Earth?
Where are you?
This is a restricted area.
Do not move!
What is she doing here, captain?
I don' t know, but we are getting her out.
You' re coming with us.
Behind you!
Hold it right there!
Damn it!
Two, coming through the wall.
Alright, hold your fire.
Ryan, Neil, let' s go.
What the hell do you think you are doing?
There is a life form in here.
There is now.
Life form or not, I' m not leaving without that life form.
Gonna be one of those days.
Captain, principal is not going to wait any much longer.
I understand that.
It' s in bad shape.
Please.
Tell me when I am risking for this plant.
I won' t even call it a plant.
It' s wheat.
I won' t even call it a wheat.
I need a minute to extract it.
Miss, that' s the minute we do not have.
I' m afraid his right about that, ma' am.
Captain, we have incomings.
Captain, we need to get out from here.
Understood, sergeant.
Could you hurry please, miss?
Done, captain.
Yes, Neil.
Just all you know, I agree with.
Let' s get out from here.
Thank you.
We' re surrounded.
No!
Shit!
Alright, everybody.
Captain, we got to get to higher ground.
Everyone, up to top.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Transport requesting immediately event.
Confirm.
Up here!
Captain!
We are right behind you.
I got you.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Alright, everybody.
Here they come.
Are you okay?
Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn' t arrest you?
I am Dr. Aki Ross.
I have clearance to be here.
Not unlimited clearance.
And not without authorization.
Captain, I don' t have time for this.
Look.
I don' t want to talk about it.
The fact of the matter is, it was worth the lives of you and your men.
You and your men?
She thinks you are a man.
I think she' s an idiot.
I know you are not a man.
I think you' re an idiot too.
Very funny.
But I do want to talk about it.
Did it occur to you that maybe we are not volunteer to risk our lives?
Have we been given a choice?
Nobody asked you to save me.
I can' t believe this.
You have not changed a bit.
Gray?
Yeah, nice to see you too.
Welcome back, captain.
We' re cleaned.
Let' s make sure of this, shall we?
I hate getting scanned.
Sir, the scan probably worth to us than the phantoms.
I' il probably abort it, captain.
This machine are suspected to causing sterility.
And I want to have a little new junior to call me daddy someday.
That' s a spooky thought.
Why are you always busting my chop?
Alright.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Okay, next.
Looks like you gain some weight.
It' s called body strength, Neil.
Get a girlfriend.
I' m working on it.
You know my security rating allows me to bypass this.
Not today, it doesn' t.
Something' s not right.
About this mission?
- Or that woman?
- Both.
Next.
I think...
I don' t care what you think, doctor.
You' re getting scanned just like everybody else.
Oh shit!
Captain!
They got him.
There must be a mistake.
You came in contact with the phantom, sir.
Please remain calm.
Administering treatment shield.
What level is he?
Blue.
He will be coded at 3 1/ 2 minutes.
I' m sorry.
That' s impossible.
We' il transfer him to the treatment center.
There' s no time for that.
Take him to the table.
Hang on, captain.
Locating particles.
Jesus!
Look at that thing.
How much more time?
Not enough.
When he reaches code red, the treatment shield won' t be able to hold the aliens particles
Engaging bio- ethereal laser.
- What' s going on?
- Where does it go?
We lost contact.
Infer station is moving deeper.
- Dragging.
- There is no time.
- Dragging.
- There is no time!
You' re gonna lose him.
Founded.
It' s alright.
Don' t worry.
You' il be back to normal in no time.
Doctor, we need to scan you for in infer station.
That won' t be necessary.
I' il take responsibility.
Hey, Doc.
Thanks for saving him.
Are you alright?
Yeah, but the military has impounded my ship
What' s with her?
And what' s with her with the captain?
What' s with her and the stupid plan?
What?
Forward me the phantom data and everything we got in the file spirits collected so far.
Yes, Doctor.
Spirits?
I thought we are not suppose to use the S word.
Don' t get smart with me.
Let' s see if the plant does the trick.
It' s a match.
We' ve found it.
Yes, the 6th spirit.
A little scene today brought me every protocol
How long do you think this would have survive outside the barrier?
Aki, you know there are elements in the Council military just waiting for an excuse to shut us down.
1 0 years ago, who discovered the energy and the phantoms?
You.
And who proved the same energy source existed in humans and every life form?
You.
You made the possible to harness that energy for overpacks, scanners, even the barrier.
The Council knows that.
They trust you, Doctor.
We are so close to proving...
Exactly.
Two more pieces and we solve the puzzle.
We need to be free to find these pieces.
I want to show you something, Aki.
- What is this?
- Read.
All life is born of Gaya and each life has a spirit.
Doctor...
Go on.
Through their experiences on Earth, the spirits mature and grows.
Bring in with it the experiences, enabling Gaya to live and grow.
To my old diary.
I wrote that 43 years ago when I was the age you are now.
Dr. Sid!
I don' t know what happen to Gary Will.
They threw him into jail because he said that Earth was not descendant of the universe.
That could happen to us.
Our ideas are unpopular, Aki.
If you have any notes or records, it could be used against you.
Destroy them.
Keep them up here.
Right.
And stay away from your friend, that captain.
That' s least to that.
I was once young too, you know.
Doctor, there is a war going on.
No one is young anymore.
Could you please explain why Zeus cannon was completed a month ago.
If we attack their media with this, we will eliminate the phantoms at their source.
General Hein, calm down.
To attack alienated media.
We have reconvince today to vote on that very issue again.
Now I would like to ask the director of the bio- ethereal center to speak.
Dr Sid, please.
As you all know, the phantom nested the alienated media that landed here 34 years ago.
What you see now, are the records of assault on the media to date.
Physical attacks here had no affect.
This seems to place 3 months ago joining a full scale of art.
Please note that the phantom outside the media are indeed destroyed.
However inside, many that come to live.
And as you see over all phantom density remains the same.
By burly, even deeper into the Earth.
Now this is very interesting to me, Dr. Sid.
- Do we not?
- Yes, indeed we do.
We have had incidents resulting and further injury to a patient.
And in some cases, death.
And what exactly does that mean, Doctor?
Exactly.
Thank you.
However, it also means that the being energy maybe too strong injuring the Earth.
Injure the Earth?
You mean the spirit of the Earth?
Yes.
The spirit of the Earth.
I need to say what I need to say.
I know what I' m doing.
And whatever you do, keep you mouth shut.
This is ridiculous.
Doctor, with all the respect.
You come here just to talk about some Gaya theory?
Tell us the planet is alive?
Has a spirit?
Sorry, but we don' t have time for that.
It' s not a fairy tale, it' s true.
I' m not just making a hole on the ground, I am killing the planet.
Dr. Sid, the Gaya theory has not been proven.
We still have to remove the phantoms.
- Don' t you agree?
- Of course I do.
But there is an alternative to this space cannon
Another method?
Yes, I mean of disabling the phantoms.
Please.
Now it is a fact that two bio- ethereal waves places one over the other will cancel each other out.
It' s the erectile possible to construct the wave pattern direct opposition to the phantom energy.
- Dr. Sid....
- such a wave in new completion...
Members of the Council, gathering plants and animals from around the world to fight the phantoms is other nonsense.
The Zeus cannon is a proven effective weapon.
It will kill phantoms.
Some army of touchy feeling plants and animals
An invention with no solid evidence that will destroy the aliens.
There is evidence.
Our partially completed energy wave has a terminally successfully stopped phantom particles from spreading through a terminally infected patient.
Not cured.
The wave is not completed.
But we have succeeded in containing the particles safely inside the patient.
Where is the proof?
Here.
You may have bothered sometime, Aki.
But I wonder what caused?
Doctor, I can' t keep hiding in the background while you protect me.
I want what life I have left to mean something.
You listen to me.
When we find the 7th and 8th spirits......
If we find them, what we need now is some luck.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
Fate and hard work, girl.
Cause I' il be damn if you die before me.
The Council decided to postpone firing the Zeus cannon.
I guess I put on a good show.
Mind if I take a look?
You' il probably get bored.
So what are you doing?
Oh, I see.
Giving me the silent treatment.
I am scanning the city for the 7th spirit.
Hurry up, Neil.
I almost got it.
What do you think you are doing?
We just gonna strengthen them for a while.
It was his idea.
It' s your idea?
We just help the captain up a little.
Come on, Jane.
Where' s your sense of romance?
You see how the captain looks at her.
It' s a more, baby.
What' s going on?
Probably just a glint.
- Listen, Aki...
- I' m still mad at you.
You are mad at me?
Leaving your helmet on and not telling me who you were?
That doesn' t seem a little childish.
I was just a little upset when you dispatched and leave the Zeus station without saying a word.
Now you know what' s going on, alright?
Now I know.
My operation had to be done in zero graph, okay?
Fine! how about the fact that I was sent there on the job
And you won' t even see me?
I was probably helping Dr. Sid collected the spirit wave.
Now I know.
Well, me too.
So we are both sorry.
So would you tell me about them?
About what?
About the spirits you collected.
I was infected by the phantom during an experiment.
Normally no one could had survived.
How could you?
Dr. Sid created a memory around the infection
Keeping me alive.
So the first spirit wave was me.
The second was a fish.
A fish?
The third was a deer I found in a wildlife- preserved outside Moscow.
The fourth was a bird.
Ever try to track a sparrow out of space?
It' s no fun.
What am I saying?
You are right.
I probably would.
And then there was that plant I collected from Time Square.
- What?
- You skipped one.
The fifth was a little girl dying in a hospital emergency room.
I told her everything has a spirit.
Dogs, cats, trees, little girls, even the earth.
I told her that she wasn' t dying, just returning to the Earth spirit.
The Gaya.
She... told me that she was ready to die.
She said I didn' t have to make up stories to make her feel better.
Only 7 years old and ready to die.
I' m sorry.
I have work to do.
I have to find the 7th and the 8th spirits.
Don' t... please....
You don' t believe any of this, do you?
I just... don' t know, Aki.
Is this why you shut me out?
You should have told me.
I don' t know how much time I left.
Who does?
I better get back to scanning.
Captain Edwards, you extracted a Dr. Ross from old New York several days ago.
Did you not?
What were you impressions of Dr Ross?
She seems very capable and determines.
You and the Deep Eyes are being temporary reassigned.
You will guard Dr. Ross when she re- enters the waste land.
Understood, sir.
You don' t understand yet, Captain.
Report any ebullient behavior in Dr Ross to the Major immediately.
Ebullient behavior, sir?
The woman carries an alien infer station, captain.
We don' t know what it maybe doing to her.
And maybe manipulate the Doctor for their very own purposes
Is the General suggesting that Dr Ross is a spy?
The General is wondering why he explains himself to a captain.
If this begins to manifest itself in anyway,
Dr Ross is to be placed under arrest.
And transport here for observation.
It is in fact for her own good, captain.
Of course, sir.
Major, send some of our man to keep an eye on our good captain.
I' m convinced these dreams are some form of communication.
The message still elude to me.
But they are coming faster now.
And that can only mean one thing.
The phantoms inside me are beginning to win
Roger.
Phantom concentration.
Not good.
We got big minutes everywhere.
Stick close to me.
No heroin today, okay?
Everything by the book.
By the book, alright.
We should be able quiet at the target and get out even before the phantoms know we were there.
And that would attract the phantoms.
For a while.
Under General Hein?
Have you done any wasteland recon before?
And get pretty ugly.
Roger that.
Stellar for hard files.
Looks like they are taking a bath.
The 7th spirit should be just beyond the line.
You' il find out soon enough.
This was the phantom cleansing mission.
It was supposed the end of war.
My father is in here somewhere.
Alright.
Let' s move out, people.
I' il be damn.
A survivor.
What is it doing out here?
Hoping for life to return.
- No.
Distance?
Hard to say.
We are very close.
I don' t see anything.
You' re not gonna tell me it' s him.
That' s impossible
It' s his overpack.
How do you explain that?
Packs?
Power or weapon?
The barrier cities?
I mean it' s just by with theory energy.
Single cell organism.
You' re telling me his backpack is the 7th spirit.
Yes.
Captain, do you read me?
Once again.
Captain, we have incoming.
Ryan, get the soldier' s pack.
I need a hand, sergeant.
Then I' il working.
Thank you.
Of course I am.
Let' s get the hell out of here.
It should be happening.
Something are tracking them.
Aki...
Closing fast.
Jane, take the lead.
Fire the hole!
Get us out of here, Neil.
- But...
- Just do it!
- Sir?
- Locate that seat.
That doesn' t look good, captain.
We have to get her to a hospital.
You have your order, sir.
What the hell is happening here?
Dr Ross is to be taken into the custody now.
That' s an order.
We have no choice but to relief you and your command.
You' il gonna have to shoot me.
Bend down, captain!
Aki!
Hang on, everyone!
That' s enough!
Everyone down.
Fast.
The device are returned from the wasteland, sir.
Apparently there was an incident.
It would seem the phantoms were attracted to Dr Ross.
The crew barely escaped with their lives.
Captain Edward is still in command.
Issue an order.
I want Edward and Dr Ross to be place under arrest.
All research materials pretending to Dr Sid wave theory are to be confiscated immediately.
That might not go over too well with the Council, sir.
What a tragedy that would be.
This is perfect, Major.
It' s too good the captain has opened the door for us.
By tomorrow morning, the Council would bear our feet.
To save them from the phantoms.
How is she, Doctor?
She is dying.
There must be something you can do.
Aki is fighting with only the 6th and 8th spirits.
We have to implant the 7th directly into her chest plate.
It took a bullet.
I think it might be damage.
We have to appear this panel quickly.
Her vital signs are dropping.
Aki is slipping away from us.
She needs a sympathetic spirit to help her held hold in this world.
And I can think of no spirit but to suit for that task but yours, captain.
I don' t understand.
You don' t have to understand.
You' il keep her here with us.
Aki, where are we?
On an alien planet.
How is that possible?
I' m not entirely sure.
You seem pretty calm.
Dream?
Well, whatever it is.
You' re really here, aren' t you?
What' s happening to me?
Dr Sid is implanting the 7th spirit directly into your body.
Then you are my spiritual support.
Gray, how sweet of you.
I don' t think you realize how serious this situation is.
Something you should see here, sir.
And I am watching... what, major?
It seems Dr Ross has been recording her dreams.
And why would I be interested in it... her dreams?
This is it.
This is our evidence.
She' s under influence of the phantoms.
Dr Ross' s dreams should be all the Council needs authorize the firing of the Zeus cannon.
The Council is contempt to hide powering inside this barrier while the world dies a little more everyday.
I believe they need a push in the right direction, major.
Get another a group of your most trusted men.
What are they doing?
Why are they staring at us?
Not at us.
Welcome back, captain.
Is it over?
How is she, Doctor?
But this is only temporary.
We need to find the 8th and final spirit to cure her.
Aki, can you hear me?
I' d finished it.
I know what the phantoms really are.
You are all under arrest!
Sir?
My wife and daughter.
Were killed by phantoms in San Francisco when the city was attacked.
Did I ever tell you that?
How is that like seeing everyone around you, fall over dead with no apparent reason.
And then at the end, you' re feeling something next to you.
Invisible... touching you.
Reaching inside your body.
Yes, sir.
That' s why I trust you.
All for you.
You know what must be done.
Major, arrest these man.
Reduce power to sector 31.
Sir, you do realize that the phantoms...
What I realize, major is that we must force the Council to take action against the enemy.
25%% of energy redirect.
Over ring power put to sector 31.
Bury the bridge in sector 31, General.
They' re coming through now.
I think we can easily handle a few phantoms in a contain space.
Relax, major.
When this night is over, you are going to be a hero.
Aki, I don' t think...
You saw it.
That' s just it.
I' m not sure what I saw.
Captain, please.
Let her continue.
Why do you think, we' ve never been able to determine a relationship between the human size phantoms.
But frequent relationship.
And your flying phantoms.
- Down, boy.
- He' s right.
If you spend as much time in this field as we have.
You know there is no relationship.
Is like a zoo out there.
Precisely, I think the giant ones are like our whales along for the ride?
It must be the ship of some kind crazy known as ark.
Perhaps it wasn' t.
The media is a chunk of their planet.
They got thrown into space when they destroyed their world.
But how could they survive the trip across outer space on a hunk of rock?
They didn' t.
This is all beginning to make a creepy kind of sense.
What do you think about all this, captain?
I think that explains why we never had a chance.
That me are fighting alien invaders.
Think of the dream, Gray.
How they die?
Since then, all they know is suffering.
They are not an invading army.
They are ghosts.
How many phantoms?
Excellent.
Send the squad out to eliminate them.
Yes, sir.
Sir, I have numerous phantoms contacts.
Well, of course you do.
Outside sector 31, sir.
And moving in incredible speed.
Major, what the hell is going on here?
They are in the pipes.
That' s impossible.
No living thing could survive in those pipes.
Well, we got a big one heading this way.
Oh my god...
Hold your fire!
What have I done?
We need to find a way out.
Now think.
Captain, these wall titanium alloy.
And the bars are all pole sonic lasers.
I mean is not like I can just wave a magic wont and...
That makes two of us.
Proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.
I think we should proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.
Proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.
Here they come.
But the others...
Dr. Sid!
Deep Eyes will take care of him.
What' s happening?
Why can we see them now?
It must be carry resistible charge passing through the barrier.
Behind you!
On the board, captain.
We must find my ship.
If it was towed inside the city, it could be in the military hangar.
That' s a big 'If'.
Look out!
- You got it.
Okay, now what?
- We' re going through the station.
- What?
- Captain, with all respect...
- Excuse me, captain...
We' re going through it.
It' s the only way.
Should I gather all this will be somehow a rough ride.
Doc, you got a talent for understatement.
Hang on, everybody.
Doc?
Interesting.
Anybody hurt?
Captain!
Oh God!
Talk to me, sergeant.
- Give me a hand, Jane.
- No, wait!
We' re risking for the injury.
We need the proper tools to cut him out.
They are in my ship.
No, Doc.
No drugs.
- Captain...
- You heard the man.
We' il find the ship and we' il be back for you.
- I' il stay with him.
- Me too.
Nobody' s staying.
Just give me a gun.
You got it.
Give him a weapon.
Do it!
We' il be back for you, sergeant.
You hear me?
I hear you, captain.
Now get out of here.
Let' s move out.
Aqua isolated T. V.
This is good.
It can be used to retrieve Ryan and transport him safely here.
However we need to replace this plane' s fuel
There could be some lives overpack in the hangar.
Check the hangar.
Neil, get us ready for take off.
Aki and Dr. Sid prep the quad troll.
I' il go to the tower and rotate the air track.
But we are not.
Let' s do this thing and get the hell out of here.
Be careful.
You too.
Neil, do you read me?
Loud and clear, captain.
This baby would fly itself.
Flight plane is set.
Beginning rotation.
This is not the air track.
We have a problem.
I' m reading an impound tracks detach to the ship.
Can you disengage it from the cockpit?
No, sir.
Permission to go outside and detach the cockpit.
Do it!
There is the problem.
The controls are locked naturally.
Jane, let me ask you something.
You think we' re going to get out here alive?
I mean I' m wondering if anybody is getting out
You think anyone had made it this far?
You think this 8th spirit stuff is going to work and chase out all the phantoms?
I mean what if it is all a bunch of mambo jumbo?
Jane, do you mind if we stop talking?
I gotta concentrate here.
What' s happening down there.
Nothing we can' t handle.
- What' s your status?
- Almost there.
We' re fine, sir.
Jane is negotiating with the extreme residents.
Talk to me, Jane.
No problem here, Captain.
Yes!
Captain, we are good to go.
No!
Jane, get out of there.
Go!
Get the hell out of there!
Unseal the power and ready.
Where are you going?
The ship is set on autopilot
We are in countdown to leave off.
It' s too dangerous.
Aki!
You son of the bitch.
Ryan!
Gray, do you read me?
What' s happening?
You and Sid are getting out of here now.
We can' t just leave everyone.
Everyone' s dead.
I' m sorry.
But you don' t have a choice.
Goodbye, Aki.
I wish I could believe they are in a better place.
The impact crater.
That' s the strange place to find the ex- spirit.
Yes, really.
But nothing can survive there except phantoms.
Precisely.
We suggest that the 8th spirit is a phantom spirit.
I can' t explain it until that moment.
- But once we get down there...
- Wait!
- You' il understand...
Yes.
Yes, I expected that' s how you' il valuate our chance.
What am I wrong?
No, I agree.
To extract the 8th spirit from the crater...
Then why should we try it?
Because we don' t need to extract the 8th spirit.
Yes.
Exactly.
And how do we do that... exactly?
That would attach to Aki' s chest plate together the eight spirits and then...
And then what?
And then we wait.
And see what happens.
That' s it?
That' s your plan?
We wait and see what happens?
Yes.
Oh good.
But I got my own plan.
We keep scanning the surface of orbit.
Maybe we' il find the compatible spirit somewhere else.
Aki?
I say we go in.
General Hein, you' re clear to go in to the zero one alpha.
What caused the battle failed, General Hein?
I' m afraid it' s only the matter of time before the phantoms develop into immunity to our barriers.
But I' m ready to see you and the rest of the Council to evacuate to Houston without incident.
It was a terrible suffer this evening.
The Council had reconsidered your proposal fire the Zeus cannon.
I see.
We are transmitting the access code to you now.
And General, best of luck to us all.
Prepare to fire the cannon.
Target, sir?
The phantom crater.
Prepare to drop in three, two, one.
Powering the shield.
Okay, we are over the mini one.
Do you have it inside, Doctor.
There are so many of them?
Wait.
Yes.
I' m tracking the 8th spirit moving along the crater surface.
Now let' s take a closer look.
Ready to fire in 3 minutes.
Overpack set maximum.
Transferring class to other.
Counter thrusters are engaged.
Locks flow the couple.
Status is green.
We have something in the radar over the impact side, sir.
It' s her.
Sir.
Just a traitor on the influence of the enemy.
Continue the countdown.
We' il take them all out at the same time.
We' re closing on the phantom.
Contact in 30 seconds.
Target locked.
Ready to fire on your command.
It' s a match.
It' s a perfect match.
Target' s cannon is ready, sir.
What was that?
It' s the Zeus.
They' re firing on the crater.
Aki, Gray, are you alright?
A little shaking.
Stand by.
Sid, the 8th spirit is not on our scanner.
Do you have it?
The 8th has been destroyed.
What are we going to do now?
Nothing.
This mission is over.
We have to get out of here.
What is that?
If you gonna get us out of here, you better do it now.
Hold on!
I can' t hold on to you.
I' m not able to maintain.
Emergency landing procedures.
Come in, come in, please
Aki, Gray, can you hear me?
Sid, I need to talk to the station.
Can you pass us through?
What is that thing?
I don' t know, sir.
Incoming message, sir.
General Hein, you must cease fire immediately.
What are you looking at, in the crater is the living spirit of an alien' s home world.
The planet was destroyed and part of the it landed here.
This is not an invasion.
It never was.
Oh, I see.
And what we have been fighting all this time, Doctor?
Ghosts?
Yes, spirits that are confused, lost and angry.
Oh right?
And these spirits are coming out of the Gaya,
Earth Gaya.
The fact remains the Earth is under attack from aggressor who must be destroyed at all cost.
The cost maybe the entire planet, sir.
Fire on the alien Gaya would only make it stronger.
I will take your protest to mean, we are in fact persuading the correct course of action.
I suggest you take your last few months and prepare to meet your Gaya.
Continue to fire until the invaders have been destroyed.
General, this is the mis- over- hitting.
And keep on hitting it, until it' s dead.
But sir, we not even sure if it has any affect on the other creature.
No affect.
We got them in the run, soldier.
This is the moment of our victory. order you to fire.
This won' t allow us to fire again.
We' il see about that.
Now shield is out, we' re seeking Doc in here.
Come on.
This is not a good place to be.
What the hell is that?
- That' s something I' m thinking, is it?
It' s Gaya.
Definitely not a good place to be.
I' m fine.
I have to talk to Dr. Sid.
Sid, do you read me?
Go ahead.
I' m still here.
We are looking at Gaya.
You hear me, sir?
Gaya!
I think this explains why the ex- spirits appeared here.
Yes.
Yes, that' s it.
A phantom must have changed into the 8th spirit when it starts a new life born on our own Gaya.
If so, it would have been given a different energy signature that set apart from the other phantoms.
You two could not have hope for better location to find a new compatible spirit.
Stay right where you are.
Staying right where we are may not be as easy as it sound.
Don' t shoot any of them.
You could destroy our last hope.
And what do you suggest I do, Doctor?
Ask them to play nice?
Combat strategy is your area of expertise, not mine.
I have a reading here in official.
Do you see it?
Yes, a compatible spirit.
It must be very near you.
Which one is it?
Which one?
I' m having difficulty now.
Just a moment.
Doctor, it' s getting crowded in here.
We don' t have much time.
Aki... Aki!
With the hope of new life, has Gaya changed the phantom within?
I have it.
Gray, get in here.
I need you.
Do you hear me, Sid?
The wave pattern is completed.
Yes, I read you.
This is wonderful.
I don' t see how you could have found the final spirit.
It found me, Doctor.
I see now.
I understand.
I don' t understand.
What the hell is going on?
Give me your overpack.
I need to project it in the complete way.
We' il be defenseless.
I hope you know what you are doing, Aki.
We can use the shield to project the wave.
Dr Sid' s theory was right.
I have it, the 8th spirit.
I' m cured, Gray.
Are you sure you have the final spirit?
I' m sure.
But how?
How can you know that?
Don' t worry, the phantom told me.
Oh, great.
That' s it.
Shield on.
It' s not working.
We have to do something before it' s too late.
If this doesn' t work, then it' s already too late.
Gray... trust me.
No!
No!
Get down!
Warning system overload.
I know.
Warning system overload.
I know!
But it must be done.
Fire!
Damn it!
Fire!
Gray?
Gray!
Don' t leave me, Gray.
I told you this was an one- way trip.
Looks like I was right.
No, Gray.
Hang on, please.
I still have the wave.
We can get through this.
We are going to make it.
We are going to make it.
We both know that isn' t time.
Gray...
Help me.
Gray...
Listen to me.
You saved my life once.
Now I want you to save yourself.
Gray, no.
Please.
Let me do this, Aki.
Trust me.
Don' t leave me, Gray.
You have been trying to tell me death isn' t the end.
Don' t back out on me.
Now I finally believe.
I love you.
Oh, it' s warm.
- Mmm.
- Mm- hmm.
- Wow.
- Yes, Marlin.
No, I see it.
It' s beautiful.
So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view... you didn' t think you' d get the whole ocean, did you?
Oh, yeah.
A fish can breathe out here.
Did your man deliver, or did he deliver?
- And it wasn' t so easy.
Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place.
You better believe they did... every single one of them.
You did good.
And the neighborhood is awesome.
So, you do like it, don' t you?
I do, I do.
I really do like it.
But do we really need so much space?
Coral, honey, these are our kids we' re talking about.
Look, look, look.
They' il wake up, poke their little heads out... and they see a whale!
Right by their bedroom window.
You' il wake the kids.
Oh, right, right.
They' re dreaming.
We still have to name them.
You want to name all of them right now?
All right, we' il name this half Marlin Junior... and this half Coral Junior.
- OK, we' re done.
- I like Nemo.
Nemo.
We' il name one Nemo... but I' d like most of them to be Marlin Junior.
Just think, in a couple of days...
- Yeah.
What if they don' t like me?
- Marlin.
- No, really.
There' s over 400 eggs.
Odds are, one will like you.
What?
- You remember how we met?
- I try not to.
Well, I remember.
"can you check and see if I have a hook in my lip?"
You got a little closer because it was wiggling.
- Get away, get away!
- Here he is.
Cutie' s here.
Where did everybody go?
Coral, get inside the house.
No, Coral, don' t.
They' il be fine.
Just get inside...
You, right now.
Ow!
Coral!
Coral?
Coral?
Coral?
Coral?
Coral?
Oh!
There, there, there.
It' s OK.
Daddy' s here.
Daddy' s got you.
I promise, I will never let anything happen to you...
Nemo.
First day of school!
Wake up, wake up!
First day of school.
I don' t want to go to school... five more minutes.
Not you, Dad, me.
Huh?
- Get up, get up.
It' s time for school, time for school.
All right, I' m up.
- Nemo!
- First day of school!
Unh!
You' il never get out of there yourself.
Unh!
- You feel a break?
- No.
Sometimes you can' t tell 'cause fluid rushes to the area.
- Are you woozy?
- No.
- How many stripes do I have?
- I' m fine.
- Answer the stripe question.
- Three.
No!
See?
Something' s wrong with you.
I have one, two, three...
That' s all I have?
You' re OK.
How' s the lucky fin?
- Lucky.
- Let' s see.
Are you sure you want to go to school this year?
There' s no problem if you don' t.
You can wait 5 or 6 years.
Come on, Dad, it' s time for school.
- Ohh.
Do you want this anemone to sting you?
- Yes.
- Brush.
- OK, I' m done.
- You missed a spot.
- Where?
- There.
Ha ha!
And here and here.
All right, we' re excited.
The first day of school.
Here we go.
We' re ready to learn to get some knowledge.
What' s the one thing we have to remember about the ocean?
- It' s not safe.
- That' s my boy.
First, we check to see that the coast is clear.
We go out... and back in.
And then we go out... and back in.
And then one more time... out and back in.
And sometimes, if you want to do it four times...
- Dad...
- All right, come on, boy.
Maybe while I' m at school, I' il see a shark.
- I highly doubt that.
- Have you ever met a shark?
No, and I don' t plan to.
- How old are sea turtles?
- I don' t know.
He says that sea turtles live to be about 100 years old.
If I ever meet a sea turtle, I' il ask him.
After I' m done talking to the shark, OK?
Whoa!
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold my fin.
like you did at the petting zoo, are you?
That snail was about to charge.
I wonder where we' re supposed to go.
Bye, Mom!
I' il pick you up after school.
Ha ha!
Come on, you guys, stop it!
Give it back!
Come on, we' il try over there.
Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher?
Well, look who' s out of the anemone.
Yes.
Shocking, I know.
- Marty, right?
- Marlin.
- Ted.
Bill.
Hey, you' re a clownfish.
You' re funny, right?
Tell us a joke.
- Yeah.
Well, actually, that' s a common misconception.
Clownfish are no funnier than any other fish.
- Come on, clownie.
- Do something funny.
All right, I know one joke.
There' s a mollusk, see?
And he walks up to a sea...
He doesn' t walk up, he swims up.
Actually, the mollusk isn' t moving.
He' s in one place, and then the sea cucumber...
Well, they...
I' m mixed up.
There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber.
None of them were walking, so forget that I...
Sheldon!
Get out of Mr. Johannsen' s yard now!
- Whoa!
- All right, you kids!
Ooh, where' d you go?
Dad, can I go play, too?
Can I?
I would feel better if you' d play on the sponge beds.
That' s where I would play.
- What' s wrong with his fin?
- He looks funny.
Hey, what' d I do?
Be nice.
It' s his first time at school.
He was born with it.
We call it his lucky fin.
- Dad...
- See this tentacle?
It' s actually shorter than all my other tentacles... but you can' t really tell.
Especially when I twirl them like this.
I' m H- 2- O intolerant.
- I' m obnoxious.
* Oh *
* Let' s name the zones, the zones, the zones *
* Let' s name the zones of the open sea *
Mr. Ray!
- Come on, Nemo.
- You better stay with me.
* Mesopelagic, bathyal, abyssalpelagic *
* All the rest are too deep for you and me to see *
I wonder where my class has gone?
We' re under here!
Oh, there you are.
Climb aboard, explorers.
* Oh, knowledge exploring *
* Is, oh, so lyrical *
* When you think thoughts that are empirical *
Dad, you can go now.
- Hello.
Who is this?
- I' m Nemo.
Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.
- OK.
- You live in what kind of home?
An anemon- none.
A nemenem- menome.
OK, don' t hurt yourself.
Welcome aboard, explorers.
Just so you know, he' s got a little fin.
I find if he' s having trouble swimming...
I let him take a break, 10, 15 minutes.
Dad, it' s time for you to go now.
We' re gonna stay together as a group.
OK, class, optical orbits up front.
And remember, we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion... to ourselves.
That means you, Jimmy.
JlMMY:
Bye, Nemo!
Bye, Dad!
Bye, son!
Be safe.
You' re doing pretty well for a first- timer.
You can' t hold on to them forever, can you?
I had a tough time with my oldest out at the drop off.
They got to grow up...
The drop off?
They' re going to the drop off?
What are you, insane?
Why don' t we fry them up now and serve them with chips?
Hey, Marty, calm down.
Don' t tell me to be calm, pony boy.
Pony boy?
For a clownfish, he really isn' t that funny.
Pity.
* Oh *
* Let' s name the species, the species, the species *
* Let' s name the species that live in the sea *
* There' s *
* Porifera, coelenterata, hydrozoa, scyphozoa *
* Anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas, three *
* Gastropoda, arthropoda, echinoderma *
* And some fish like you and me *
Come on, sing with me.
* Oh *
Just the girls this time.
* Oh, seaweed is cool *
* Seaweed is fun *
* It makes its food *
OK, the drop off.
All right, kids, feel free to explore... but stay close.
Gather.
An entire ecosystem contained in one infinitesimal speck.
There are as many protein pairs contained in this...
Come on, let' s go.
Come on, sing with me!
Hey, guys, wait up!
Cool.
Saved your life!
Aw, you guys made me ink.
What' s that?
I know what that is.
Sandy Plankton saw one.
He said it was called a butt.
- Wow.
That' s a pretty big butt.
Oh, look at me.
Whoa!
Oh, yeah?
Let' s see you get closer.
OK.
Beat that.
How far can you go?
My dad says it' s not safe.
- Nemo!
No!
- Dad?
You were about to swim into open water.
No, I wasn' t...
Good thing I was here.
If I hadn' t shown up...
- He wasn' t going to go.
- He was too afraid.
No, I wasn' t.
This does not concern you, kids... and you' re lucky I don' t tell your parents.
You know you can' t swim well.
I can swim fine, Dad, OK?
No, it' s not OK.
You shouldn' t be near here.
OK, I was right.
You' il start school in a year or two.
No, Dad!
Just because you' re scared of the ocean...
Clearly, you' re not ready... and you' re not coming back until you are.
You think you can do these things... but you just can' t, Nemo!
I hate you.
* There' s *
Nothing to see.
Over there.
Is there anything I can do?
I am a scientist, sir.
Is there any problem?
I didn' t mean to interrupt things.
He isn' t a good swimmer, and it' s a little too soon... for him to be out here unsupervised.
I can assure you, he' s quite safe with me.
I' m sure he is, but you have a large class... and he can get lost from sight if you' re not looking.
I' m not saying you' re not looking.
Oh, my gosh!
Nemo' s swimming out to sea!
Nemo!
What do you think you' re doing?
You' il get stuck out there... and I' il have to get you before another fish does.
Get back here!
I said get back here now!
Stop!
You take one more move, mister...
Don' t you dare!
If you put one fin on that boat...
Are you listening to me?
Don' t touch the bo...
Nemo!
He touched the butt.
You paddle your little tail right back here, Nemo.
That' s right.
You are in big trouble, young man.
Do you hear me?
Big...
- Aah!
Daddy!
Help me!
I' m coming, Nemo!
- Get under me, kids!
No!
Dad!
Daddy!
Nemo!
Nemo!
Nemo!
No!
No!
Nemo!
Hold on.
Oh, no.
It' s gone.
No, no, it can' t be gone.
Nemo!
Nemo!
No!
Nemo!
No, please, no!
No, no!
Has anybody seen a boat?
Please!
A white boat!
They took my son!
My son!
Help me, please.
- Look out!
- What?
Sorry.
I didn' t see you.
Are you OK?
- He' s gone, he' s gone.
It' s all right.
- He' s gone.
- It' il be OK.
They took him away.
I have to find the boat.
A boat?
Hey, I' ve seen a boat.
- You have?
- It passed by not too long ago.
- A white one?
- Hi.
I' m Dory.
Where?
Which way?
It went this way.
It went this way.
Follow me.
Thank you, thank you so much.
No problem.
Hey...
Wait!
- Will you quit it?
- What?
I' m trying to swim here.
Ocean isn' t big enough for you?
Huh?
Do you?
Do you?
You want a piece of me?
Ooh, I' m scared now.
What?
- Wait a minute.
- Stop following me, OK?
What?
You' re showing me where the boat went.
A boat?
Hey, I' ve seen a boat.
It passed by not too long ago.
It went this way.
It went this way.
Follow me.
What is going on?
You already told me which way the boat was going.
I did?
Oh, no.
If this is some kind of practical joke, it' s not funny.
And I know funny.
I' m a clownfish.
I know it' s not.
I' m so sorry.
See, I suffer from short- term memory loss.
Short- term memory loss.
I don' t believe this.
No, it' s true.
I forget things almost instantly.
It runs in my family.
At least, I think it does.
Where are they?
Can I help you?
Something' s wrong with you... really.
You' re wasting my time.
I have to find my son.
Hello.
- Well, hi!
Name' s Bruce.
It' s all right.
I understand.
Why trust a shark, right?
So, what' s a couple of bites like you... doing out so late, eh?
We' re not doing anything.
We' re not even out.
Great!
like to come to a little get- together I' m having?
You mean, like a party?
A party.
What do you say?
I love parties.
That sounds like fun.
Parties are fun, and it' s tempting, but...
Oh, come on, I insist.
OK.
That' s all that matters.
Hey, look, balloons.
It is a party.
Mind your distance, though.
Those balloons can be a bit dodgy.
You wouldn' t want one of them to pop.
Anchor!
Chum!
There you are, Bruce.
Finally.
- We got company.
- It' s about time, mate.
We' ve already gone through the snacks... and I' m still starving.
We almost had a feeding frenzy.
Come on, let' s get this over with.
Right, then.
The meeting has officially come to order.
Let us all say the pledge.
I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine.
I must first change myself.
Fish are friends, not food.
Except stinkin 'dolphins.
Dolphins.
Yeah.
They think they' re so cute.
"Look at me.
I' m a flippin 'little dolphin.
"Let me flip for you.
Ain' t I something? "
Right, then.
Today' s meeting is Step 5...
Bring a Fish Friend.
Do you all have your friends?
Got mine.
- Hey, there.
- How about you, Chum?
Oh, I... seem to have misplaced my friend.
That' s all right, Chum.
I had a feeling this would be a difficult step.
You can help yourself to one of my friends.
Thanks, mate.
A little chum for Chum, eh?
I' il start the testimonies.
My name is Bruce.
Hello, Bruce.
It has been three weeks since my last fish.
On my honor, or may I be chopped up and made into soup.
- You' re an inspiration!
- Amen.
Right, then.
Who' s next?
Pick me, pick me.
The little Sheila down the front.
- Come on up here.
Hi.
I' m Dory.
- Hello, Dory.
- And, uh, well...
I don' t think I' ve ever eaten a fish.
- That' s incredible.
- Good on you, mate.
I' m glad I got that off my chest.
All right, anyone else?
How about you, mate?
What' s your problem?
MARLlN:
I don' t have a problem.
Oh, OK.
- Aah!
Just start with your name.
Uh, hello.
My name is Marlin.
I' m a clownfish.
- A clownfish?
Really?
- Tell us a joke.
I love jokes.
I actually do know one that' s pretty good.
There was this mollusk... and he walks up to a sea cucumber.
Normally, they don' t talk, sea cucumbers... but in a joke, everyone talks... so the sea mollusk says to the cucumber...
Daddy!
Nemo!
Ha ha!
I don' t get it.
For a clownfish, he' s not that funny.
He' s my son.
He was taken by these divers.
You poor fish.
Humans... think they own everything.
Probably American.
Looking for his little boy.
Looking for his little boy.
What do these markings mean?
I never knew my father!
- Group hug.
- We' re all mates here, mate.
I can' t read human.
We got to find a fish that can read this.
- Hey, look, sharks.
- No, no, no, Dory!
- Guys, guys.
- No, Dory.
Give it to me.
Ow!
Oh, I' m sorry.
Are you OK?
- I' m so sorry.
You really clocked me there.
Am I bleeding?
Ohh.
Ohh, that' s good.
Intervention!
- Just a bite.
- Hold it together, mate!
Remember, Bruce, fish are friends, not food!
- Food!
- Dory, look out!
- I' m having fish tonight!
Remember the steps, mate!
- Aah!
Grr!
There' s no way out!
There' s got to be a way to escape!
Who is it?
Dory, help me find a way out!
Sorry.
Come back later.
We' re trying to escape.
- There' s got to be a way out!
- Here' s something.
I wonder what that means.
Funny.
It' s spelled just like "escape."
- Aah!
Here' s Brucey!
Wait a minute.
You can read?
That' s right.
I can read!
Well, then, here.
Read this now.
He really doesn' t mean it.
He never even knew his father.
Don' t fall off the wagon!
Oh, no, it' s blocked!
No, Bruce, focus.
Sorry about Bruce, mate.
He' s really a nice guy.
I need to get that mask.
You want that mask?
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Quick, grab the mask!
Oh, no.
Bruce?
What?
Swim away!
Aw, is the party over?
Nice.
Dad?
Daddy?
- Uh- huh?
Prep for his anterior crown, would you, please?
And I' m going to need a few more cotton rolls.
OK.
Hello, little fella.
Beauty, isn' t he?
I found that guy struggling for life... out on the reef, and I saved him.
So, has that Novocaine kicked in yet?
Bubbles!
My bubbles.
He likes bubbles.
- Aah!
Slow down, little fella.
There' s nothing to worry about.
- He' s scared to death.
- I want to go home.
Do you know where my dad is?
Honey, your dad' s probably back at the pet store.
Pet store?
Yeah, you know, like, I' m from Bob' s Fish Mart.
- Fish- O- Rama.
- Ebay.
- So, which one is it?
- I' m from the ocean.
Ah, the ocean.
The ocean?
He hasn' t been decontaminated.
Jacques!
- Oui.
- Clean him!
Oui.
- Ooh, la mer.
Bon.
Voila.
He is clean.
Wow.
The big blue.
What' s it like?
- Big and blue?
- I knew it.
If there' s anything you need, just ask your Auntie Deb.
Or if I' m not around, you can talk to my sister Flo.
How are you?
Don' t listen to anything my sister says.
Ha ha ha ha!
We got a live one.
- Can' t hear you, Peach.
- I said we got a live one.
- Boy, oh, boy.
- What do we got?
Root canal... and by the looks of those x- rays... it' s not going to be pretty.
- Dam and clamp installed?
- Yep.
- What did he use to open?
- Gator- Glidden drill.
He seems to favor that one lately.
I can' t see, Flo.
Aah!
Now he' s doing the Schilder technique.
He' s using a Hedstrom file.
That' s not a Hedstrom file.
That' s a K- Flex.
It has a teardrop cross- section.
Clearly a Hedstrom.
- Hedstrom.
- K- Flex!
- Hedstrom!
There I go.
A little help, over here.
I' il go deflate him.
DENTlST:
Go ahead and rinse.
Oh, the human mouth is a disgusting place.
- Hey, Nigel.
- What did I miss?
Root canal... a doozy.
Root canal?
What did he use to open?
- Gator- Glidden drill.
- He' s favoring that one.
Hope he doesn' t get surplus sealer at the portal terminus.
Who' s this?
Ha ha ha!
The dentist took him off the reef.
An outie.
From my neck of the woods, eh?
Sorry if I ever took a snap at you.
Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat.
No, no, no, no!
They' re not your fish.
They' re my fish.
Go on, shoo!
Aw, the picture broke.
This here' s Darla.
She' s my niece.
She' s going to be eight this week.
Hey, little fella.
Say hello to your new mummy.
She' il be here Friday to pick you up.
Shh, shh, shh.
It' s our little secret.
I' m going to see a man about a wallaby.
Oh, Darla.
What?
What' s wrong with her?
She wouldn' t stop shaking the bag.
- Poor Chuckles.
- He was her present last year.
PEACH:
She' s a fish killer.
I can' t go with that girl.
I have to get back to my dad.
Help me!
Oh, he' s stuck.
Nobody touch him.
Nobody touch him.
Can you help me?
You got yourself in there.
You got yourself in there.
You can get yourself out.
- Gill...
- I want to see him do it.
Calm down.
Alternate wiggling your fins and your tail.
I can' t.
I have a bad fin.
Never stopped me.
Just think about what you need to do.
Come on.
Perfect.
- You did it!
Ha ha ha!
From the ocean... just like you, Gill.
Yeah.
I' ve seen that look before.
What are you thinking about?
I' m thinking... tonight, we give the kid a proper reception.
So, kid, you got a name or what?
Nemo.
I' m Nemo.
Nemo.
Nemo.
Are you gonna eat that?
- Huh?
No, no.
What does it say?
Dory!
A sea monkey has my money.
Come on.
Come on!
- Yes, I' m a natural blue.
- Get up!
Look out!
Aah!
DORY:
Dusty.
The mask.
Where' s the mask?
No, not the mask!
Get the mask!
Get it!
It just keeps going on, doesn' t it?
Echo!
Echo!
Hey, what you doing?
It' s gone.
I' ve lost the mask.
- Did you drop it?
- You dropped it!
That was my only chance of finding my son.
Now it' s gone.
Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills... when life gets you down, know what you got to do?
- I don' t want to know.
- Just keep swimming.
* Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming *
* What do we do?
We swim, swim *
Dory, no singing.
* I love to swim *
* When you want to swim *
See, I' m going to get stuck now with that song.
- Now it' s in my head.
- Sorry.
Dory, do you see anything?
Something' s got me.
- That was me.
I' m sorry.
- Who' s that?
- Who could it be?
It' s me.
Are you my conscience?
Yeah, yeah.
I' m your conscience.
We haven' t spoken for a while.
How are you?
- Can' t complain.
- Yeah?
Good.
Do you see anything?
I see a...
I see a light.
- A light?
- Yeah.
Over there.
- Hey, conscience, am I dead?
I see it, too.
What is it?
It' s so pretty.
I' m feeling... happy... which is a big deal for me.
I want to touch it.
Hey, come back.
Come on back here.
* I' m gonna get you *
I' m gonna get you.
* I' m gonna swim with you *
I' m gonna get you.
* I' m gonna be your best friend *
Good feeling' s gone.
I can' t see!
I don' t know where I' m going!
- The mask!
- What mask?
OK, I can' t see a thing.
- Hey, look, a mask.
Read it!
Bring it a little closer, I kind of need the light.
That' s great.
Keep it right there.
- Just read it!
- OK, OK.
Uh, "P."
OK.
"P. Sher..."
"Sher...
P. Sher... "
P. Shirley?
P... "
Oh.
The first line' s "P. Sherman."
"P. Sherman" doesn' t make any sense!
Second line.
"42."
Don' t eat me.
Light, please!
DORY:
The second line' s "42 Wallaby Way."
Speed read.
No problem.
There' s a lot of pressure.
Pressure!
Take a guess now with pressure!
- "Sydney"!
It' s "Sydney"!
- Duck!
I' m dead.
I' m dead, I' m dead, I' m dead.
I died.
I' m dead.
* We did it, we did it *
* No eating here tonight, whoo! *
* Eating here tonight *
* No, no, no, eating here tonight *
- Dory. - * You on a diet *
Dory!
What did the mask say?
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
I remembered what it said!
I usually forget things, but I remembered it!
Where is that?
I don' t know.
But who cares?
I remembered.
DORY:
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
I remembered it again!
Nemo.
* Nemo *
- Suivez- moi.
Follow me.
State your name.
Nemo.
Brother Bloat, proceed.
Nemo, newcomer of orange and white... you have been called forth... to the summit of Mount Wannahockaloogie... to join with us in the fraternal bonds of tankhood.
- Huh?
- We want you in our club, kid.
- Really?
- Lf... you are able to swim through...
The Ring of Fire!
Turn on the Ring of Fire!
You said you could do it.
The Ring of Fire!
Oh!
Isn' t there another way?
He' s just a boy!
From this moment on, you will be known as Sharkbait.
Sharkbait, oo- ha- ha!
Welcome, Brother Sharkbait.
Sharkbait, oo- ha- ha!
- Enough with the Sharkbait.
- Sharkbait!
Sharkbait' s one of us now, agreed?
- Agreed.
- We can' t send him to his death.
Darla' s coming in five days.
So, what are we going to do?
I' il tell you what we' re gonna do... we' re gonna get him out of here.
- We' il help him escape.
- Escape?
Really?
We' re all gonna escape.
Gill, please.
Not another escape plan.
Sorry, but they just never work.
Why should this be any different?
- Because we' ve got him.
- Me?
- You see that filter?
- Yeah.
You' re the only one who can get in and out of that thing.
We need you to take a pebble inside there... and jam the gears.
You do that, and this tank' s gonna get... filthier and filthier by the minute.
Pretty soon, the dentist' il have to clean the tank... and when he does, he' il take us out of the tank... put us in individual baggies... then we' il roll ourselves down the counter... out the window, off the awning... into the bushes, across the street... and into the harbor!
It' s foolproof.
Who' s with me?
- Aye!
- Aye!
I think you' re nuts.
No offense, kid, but you' re not the best swimmer.
He can do this.
So, Sharkbait, what do you think?
Let' s do it.
DORY:
I' m going to P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Where are you going?
I' m going to P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
If you ask where I' m going...
I' il tell you that' s where I' m going.
It' s P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Where?
I' m sorry, I didn' t hear you.
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Excuse me.
Do you know how to get...
Wait.
Hold it!
I' m trying to talk to you!
Fellas, come back here.
One quick question.
I need to...
And they' re gone again.
DORY:
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Why do I have to tell you over and over again?
I' il tell you again.
I don' t get tired of it...
- OK, all right.
- Huh?
- Uh- huh.
I think it' s best if I carry on from here by... by myself.
OK.
- Uh- huh.
Without... without...
I mean, not without you.
But I don' t want you... with me.
- Am I...
I don' t want to hurt your feelings.
- You want me to leave?
- I mean, not...
Yes.
I just can' t afford any more delays... and you' re one of those fish that cause delays.
Sometimes it' s a good thing.
There' s a whole group of fish.
They' re delay fish.
You mean...
You mean you don' t like me?
No, of course I like you.
It' s because I like you I don' t want to be with you.
It' s a complicated emotion.
- Don' t cry.
I like you.
Hey, you!
Lady, is this guy bothering you?
I don' t remember.
Were you?
No, no, no, no, no.
We' re just...
Do you guys know how I can get to...
Look, pal, we' re talking to the lady, not you.
You like impressions?
Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen.
So what are we?
Take a guess.
I' ve seen one of those.
I' m a fish with a nose like a sword.
- Wait, wait, um...
- It' s a swordfish!
LEADER:
Where' s the butter?
It' s on the tip of my tongue!
- Lobster.
- Saw that!
Lots of legs!
Live in the ocean.
- Clam!
- Close enough!
* Oh, it' s a whale of a tale *
* I' il tell you, lad... *
They' re good.
Will somebody please give me directions?!
"Will somebody please give me directions?!"
- I' m serious!
Thank you.
Hey!
Hey, come back!
- Hey, what' s the matter?
- What' s the matter?
I am miles from home with a fish that can' t remember her name!
I bet that' s frustrating.
Meanwhile, my son is out there.
- Your son Chico?
- Nemo?
But it doesn' t matter because no fish... in this entire ocean is going to help me.
Well, I' m helping you.
Wait right here.
- Guys!
- Is he bothering you again?
He' s a good guy.
He' s lost his son Fabio.
He' s lost his son Fabio.
Any of you heard of P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?
Sydney?
Oh, sure!
Ted here' s got relatives in Sydney.
- Don' t you, Ted?
- Sure do!
They know Sydney!
You wouldn' t know how to get there, would you?
You want to follow the E. A. C.
That' s the East Australian Current.
Big current.
Can' t miss it.
It' s in... that direction.
And then you follow that for about...
I don' t know.
What do you guys think?
About three leagues?
That little baby will put you right past Sydney.
- That' s great!
Dory, you did it!
Oh, please, I' m just your little helper.
- Helping along.
That' s me.
- Fellas, thank you.
LEADER:
Just loosen up, OK, buddy?
You really nailed him.
One more thing.
When you come to this trench, swim through it, not over it.
DORY:
Trench... through it, not over it.
Hey, hey!
Hold on!
I gotta tell you something.
Nice trench.
Hello!
- OK, let' s go.
- No, no.
Bad trench.
Come on, we' il swim over this thing.
Whoa, partner.
Little red flag going up.
Something' s telling me to swim through it, not over it.
Are you looking at this thing?
It' s got death written all over it.
I really, really, really think we should swim through.
And I' m really, really done talking about this.
Over we go.
- Trust me on this.
- Trust you?
Yes, trust.
It' s what friends do.
Look!
Something shiny!
- Where?
- It just swam over the trench.
- Come on, we' il follow it!
Boy, it sure is clear up here.
Exactly.
And look at that... there' s the current.
We should be there in no time.
Hey, little guy.
You wanted to go through the trench.
I shall call him Squishy, and he shall be mine.
Come here, Squishy.
Come here, little Squishy.
- That' s a jellyfish!
- Bad Squishy!
Shoo, shoo!
Get away!
- Let me see that.
- Don' t touch it.
I won' t touch it.
I just want to look.
How come it didn' t sting you?
It did.
It' s just that...
Ow!
It doesn' t look bad.
You' il be fine.
But now we know, don' t we... that we don' t want to touch these again.
Let' s be thankful this time it was just a little one.
Don' t move.
- This is bad, Dory.
- Hey, watch this!
Dory!
* You can' t catch me *
Don' t bounce on the tops!
They will... not sting you!
- The tops don' t sting you!
Beat that!
Dory, listen to me.
I have an idea... a game.
- A game?
- Yes.
- I love games!
Pick me!
- Here' s the game.
Whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish wins!
- OK.
- Rules, rules, rules!
You can' t touch the tentacles.
Only the tops.
Something about tentacles.
Go!
Wait!
Not something about 'em, it' s all about' em!
- Wait, Dory!
Gotta go faster if you want to win!
Dory!
Whoa!
Dory!
We' re cheating death now.
That' s what we' re doing.
But we' re having fun at the same time.
I can do this.
Just be careful.
Yeah, careful I don' t make you cry when I win!
I don' t think so!
Give it up, old man.
You can' t fight evolution.
I was built for speed.
The question is, Dory, are you hungry?
- Hungry?
- Yeah.
'Cause you' re about to eat my bubbles!
Duck to the left!
Right there!
The clownfish is the winner!
We did it!
Look at us!
Dory?
Dory?
Oh, no.
Dory!
Dory!
Dory!
Am I disqualified?
No, you' re doing fine!
You' re actually winning!
But you gotta stay awake.
Where does P. Sherman live?
DORY:
P. Sherman...
Wallaby Way, Sydney...
That' s it!
- Wallaby Way...
Stay awake!
Stay awake!
Stay... awake!
- Awake.
- P. Sherman.
- 42 Wallaby Way.
Nemo...
Nemo...
You miss your dad, don' t you, Sharkbait?
Yeah.
You' re lucky to have someone out there looking for you.
He' s not looking for me.
He' s scared of the ocean.
Peach, any movement?
He' s had four cups of coffee.
It' s gotta be soon.
Keep on him.
landed on dental tools.
I was aiming for the toilet.
Toilet?
All drains lead to the ocean, kid.
Wow.
How many times have you tried to get out?
Ah, I' ve lost count.
Fish aren' t meant to be in a box, kid.
It does things to you.
Bubbles!
Potty break!
He grabbed the "Reader' s Digest."
- We have 4. 2 minutes!
- That' s your cue, Sharkbait.
- You can do it, kid.
- We gotta be quick.
Once you get in, swim to the bottom of the chamber... and I' il talk you through the rest.
- OK.
- It' il be a piece of kelp.
Nicely done!
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah!
Here comes the pebble.
Now, do you see a small opening?
Inside it, you' il see a rotating fan.
Wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it turning.
- Careful, Sharkbait!
- I can' t do it!
Gill, this isn' t a good idea.
He' il be fine.
Try again!
OK.
That' s it, Sharkbait.
Nice and steady.
I got it!
- He did it!
- That' s great, kid!
Now swim up the tube and out.
Oh, no!
Gill!
- Sharkbait!
- Oh, my gosh!
Get him outta there!
- What do we do?
- Oh, no!
Just don' t panic!
Help me!
Sharkbait, grab hold of this!
- No!
- Feed me more!
- That' s it!
- Sharkbait!
Grab it!
I got it!
Pull!
Gill, don' t make him go back in there.
No.
We' re done.
Dude.
- Dude.
Dude.
Oh, he lives.
Hey, dude!
What happened?
Saw the whole thing, dude.
First, you were all, like, "Whoa!"... and then we were all, like, "Whoa!"... and then you were, like, "Whoa."
What are you talking about?
You, mini- man.
Takin 'on the jellies.
You got serious thrill issues, dude.
- Awesome.
Ohh!
No hurlin 'on the shell, dude, OK?
Just waxed it.
So, Mr. Turtle...
Mr. Turtle is my father.
The name' s Crush.
Crush?
Really?
OK, Crush.
I need to the East Australian Current.
E. A. C.?
Oh, dude.
You' re ridin 'it, dude!
Check it out!
OK, grab shell, dude!
Grab wh- a- a- at?!
Righteous!
- Stop!
What brings you on this fine day to the E. A. C.?
Dory and I need to get to Sydney.
Dory!
Is she all right?
Oh, little blue.
She is sub- level, dude.
Dory!
Dory.
I' m so sorry.
It' s my fault.
Twenty- nine, thirty!
Ready or not, here I come!
There you are!
Catch me if you can!
Dory
Nice wave!
Up you go!
- Oh, my goodness!
- Kill the motor, dude.
Let us see what Squirt does flying solo.
That was so cool!
Hey, Dad, did you see that?
Did you see me?
Did you see what I did?
You so totally rock, Squirt!
So give me some fin.
Noggin.
- Dude.
- Dude.
Oh... intro.
Jellyman, offspring.
Offspring, Jellyman.
- Jellies?!
Sweet.
- Totally.
Apparently, I must' ve done something you liked... dudes.
- Ow.
Curl away, my son.
It' s awesome, Jellyman.
The little dudes are just eggs.
We leave 'em on a beach to hatch... and then, coo- coo- cachoo... they find their way back to the big ol' blue.
- All by themselves?
- Yeah.
But, dude, how do you know when they' re ready?
Well, you never really know.
But when they know, you' il know, you know?
Hey, look, everybody.
I know that dude!
It' s the Jellyman!
Jump on him!
- Turtle pile!
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Are you funny?
- Where' s your shell?
- Are you running away?
Did you really cross the jellyfish forest?
- Did they sting you?
- One at a time!
Mr. Fish, did you die?
Sorry, I was a little vague on the details.
So, where are you going?
You see, my son was taken.
My son was taken away from me.
- No way.
- What happened?
I don' t want to talk about it.
Please?
Please?
Well, OK.
I live on this reef a long, long way from here.
This is gonna be good.
I can tell.
And my son Nemo...
See, he was mad at me.
And maybe he wouldn' t have done it... if I hadn' t been so tough on him.
I don' t know.
Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat... and when he was out there, these divers appeared... and I tried to stop them, but the boat was too fast.
So, we swam out in the ocean to follow them...
They couldn' t stop 'em.
And then Nemo' s dad... he swims out to the ocean, and they bump into...... three ferocious sharks.
He scares away the sharks by blowing 'em up!
Golly, that' s amazing.
And then dives thousands of feet...... straight down into the dark.
It' s wicked dark down there.
You can' t see a thing.
How' s it going, Bob?
And the only thing they can see down there...... is the light from this big, horrible creature... with razor- sharp teeth.
Nice parry, old man.
And then he has to blast his way...
So, these two little fish have been... searching the ocean for days on the East Australian Current.
Which means that he may be on his way here right now.
That should put him in Sydney Harbor...... in a matter of days.
I mean, it sounds like... this guy is gonna stop at nothing...... till he finds his son.
That' s one dedicated father, if you ask me.
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Would you just shut up?!
You' re rats with wings!
Bloke' s been looking for his boy Nemo.
- Nemo?!
- He was taken off the reef...
- Take it!
- Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Hey, say that again!
Something about Nemo.
Mine!
Mine?
Last I heard, he' s heading towards the harbor.
Brilliant!
Is he doing OK?
Whatever you do, Don' t mention D- a- r...
It' s OK.
I know who you' re talking about.
Gill?
Gill?
Hey, Sharkbait.
I' m sorry I couldn' t stop the...
No, I' m the one who should be sorry.
I was so ready to get out... so ready to taste that ocean...
I was willing to put you in harm' s way to get there.
Nothing should be worth that.
I' m sorry I couldn' t get you back to your father, kid.
All right.
Hey, hey, hey...
- Aaah!
That' s one way to pull a tooth.
Darn kids.
Good thing I pulled the right one, eh, Prime Minister?
You just missed an extraction.
Has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet?
What am I talking about?
Where' s Nemo?
- I' ve got to speak with him.
- What is it?
Your dad' s been fighting the entire ocean...
- Iooking for you.
- My father?
Really?
He' s traveled hundreds of miles, battling sharks and jellyfish...
Sharks?
That can' t be him.
What was his name?
Some sort of sport fish.
- Tuna?
Trout?
- Marlin?
Marlin!
The little clownfish from the reef.
It' s my dad!
He took on a shark!
I heard he took on three.
- Three sharks?
- That' s 4, 800 teeth!
After you were taken by Diver Dan over there... your dad followed the boat like a maniac.
Really?
He' s swimming, giving it all he' s got... and then three gigantic sharks capture him... and he blows them up and dives thousands of feet... and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth!
He ties this demon to a rock, and what' s his reward?
He gets to battle an entire jellyfish forest!
Now he' s with a bunch of sea turtles on the E. A. C... and the word is he' s headed this way right now... to Sydney!
- What a good daddy!
He was looking for you after all, Sharkbait.
He' s swimming to the filter!
- Sharkbait!
- Not again!
Sharkbait!
No!
You got your whole life ahead of you!
- We' il help you, kid!
- Get him out!
Get him out of there!
Come on, kid!
Grab the end!
Sharkbait!
- Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Yeah, I can hear you.
Sharkbait, you did it!
Sharkbait, you' re... covered with germs!
That took guts, kid.
All right, gang, we have less than 48 hours... before Darla gets here.
This tank' il get plenty dirty in that time... but we have to help it along any way we can.
- Jacques?
No cleaning.
- I shall resist.
Everybody else, be as gross as possible.
Think dirty thoughts.
We' re gonna make this tank so filthy... the dentist will have to clean it.
- Ha ha ha!
All right, we' re here, dudes!
Get ready!
Your exit' s coming up, man!
MARLlN:
I don' t see it!
Right there!
I see it!
The swirling vortex of terror?
- That' s it, dude.
- Of course it is.
OK, first, find your exit buddy.
Do you have your exit buddy?
Yes!
Squirt give you a rundown of proper exiting technique.
Good afternoon!
We' il have a great jump today!
OK, crank a hard cutback as you hit the wall.
There' s a screaming bottom turn, so watch out!
Remember... rip it, roll it, and punch it!
He' s trying to speak to me, I know it!
You' re really cute, but I don' t know what you' re saying!
Say the first thing again.
OK, Jellyman!
Go, go, go!
That was... fun!
I actually enjoyed that.
Hey, look, turtles!
Most excellent!
Now turn your fishy tails around... and swim straight on through to Sydney!
No worries, man!
No worries!
Thank you, dude Crush!
- Bye, Jellyman!
You tell your little dude I said hi, OK?
See ya later, dudes!
Bye, everyone!
Nemo would have loved this.
Crush, I forgot!
How old are you?
150, dude!
Rock on!
150!
I gotta remember that.
- We going in there?
- Yep.
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?
Yep.
We' re gonna just swim straight.
* Just keep swimming, just keep swimming *
Dory...
Boy, this is taking awhile.
How about we play a game?
OK.
OK, I' m thinking of something orange... and it' s small...
- It' s me.
- Right!
It' s orange and small...
It' s me.
All righty, Mr. Smartypants.
And it' s orange and small and white stripes...
Me.
And the next one, just a guess, me.
- That' s just scary.
- Wait, wait, wait.
I have definitely seen this floating speck before.
That means we' ve passed it before... and that means we' re going in circles... and that means we' re not going straight!
- Get to the surface.
We' il figure it out up there.
Let' s go!
Relax.
- What?
Take a deep breath.
Now, let' s ask somebody for directions.
Who do you want to ask, the speck?
- There' s nobody here!
- There has to be someone.
It' s the ocean, silly.
We' re not the only two in here.
Let' s see.
OK, no one there.
Nope.
Nada.
There' s somebody.
Excuse...
Dory, Dory, Dory!
Now it' s my turn.
I' m thinking of something dark and mysterious.
It' s a fish we don' t know.
If we ask it directions... it could ingest us and spit out our bones!
What is it with men and asking for directions?
I don' t want to play the gender card right now.
Let' s play the "Let' s Not Die" card.
- You want to get out of here?
- Of course I do.
How are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot?
Dory, you don' t fully understand...
Trust me on this.
All right.
Excuse me!
Little fella?
Hello!
Hello!
Hello.
- His son Bingo...
- Nemo.
- Nemo was taken to...
- Sydney.
Sydney!
And it' s really, really important... that we get there as fast as we can... so can you help us out?
Come on.
Dory, I' m a little fella.
I don' t think that' s a little fella.
DORY:
Big fella.
Whale.
OK.
Maybe he only speaks whale.
Weee neeed...
- Dory?
- Tooo fiind his son.
What are you doing?
Are you sure you speak whale?
Can youuuu give us diiirectionsss?
Dory!
Heaven knows what you' re saying!
- See, he' s swimming away.
- Cooome baaack.
He' s not coming back.
You offended him.
- Maybe a different dialect.
- Dory!
This is not whale.
You' re speaking upset stomach.
- Maybe I should try humpback.
- Don' t.
- You actually sound sick.
- Maybe louder?
- Don' t do that!
Too much orca.
Didn' t it sound orca- ish?
It doesn' t sound orca.
It sounds like nothing I' ve ever heard.
He might be hungry.
He might be hungry.
Whales don' t eat clownfish.
They eat krill.
Swim away!
- Oh, look, krill!
Move, Dory, move!
Would you look at that?
Filthy.
Absolutely filthy.
All thanks to you, kid.
You made it possible.
Jacques, I said no cleaning.
I am ashamed.
Look!
Scum angel!
Bubbles!
I love the bubbles!
Flo?
Has anybody seen Flo?
9: 00 and cue dentist.
Hello, Barbara.
Sorry I' m late.
Here we go, OK.
Little Davey Reynolds...
Walks to the counter, drops the keys...
Bloat, that' s disgusting!
Tastes pretty good to me.
Don' t you people realize we are swimming in our own...
Here he comes!
Crikey.
What a state.
Barbara, what' s my earliest appointment tomorrow?
- Leave it open, would you?
I' ve gotta clean the fish tank before Darla gets here.
Did you hear that, Sharkbait?
He' s gonna clean the tank!
We' re gonna be clean!
You ready to see your dad, kid?
- Of course you are.
In the harbor waiting for you right now.
Here comes the big one.
You gotta try this!
- Will you just stop it?
What' s wrong?
We' re in a whale, don' t you get it?
- Whale?
- A whale!
You had to ask for help!
And now we' re stuck here!
Wow, a whale.
I speak whale.
No, you' re insane!
You can' t speak whale!
I have to get out!
I have to find my son!
I have to tell him how old sea turtles are!
Hey... you OK?
There, there.
It' s all right.
It' il be OK.
No, it won' t.
Sure it will.
You' il see.
No.
I promised him I' d never let anything happen to him.
That' s a funny thing to promise.
What?
You can' t never let anything happen to him.
Then nothing would ever happen to him.
Not much fun for little Harpo.
- What' s going on?
Don' t know.
I' il ask him.
- Dory...
- Whaaat' s goooing onnn?
I think he says we' ve stopped.
Of course we' ve stopped.
Stop trying to speak whale.
You' il make things worse.
What is that noise?
Look what you did.
It' s going down!
Really?
You sure about that?
Look!
Already it' s half empty!
I' d say it' s half full.
Stop that!
It' s half empty!
OK, that one was a little tougher.
He either said we should go to the back of the throat... or he wants a root beer float.
Of course he wants us to go there!
That' s eating us!
How do I taste, Moby?
Do I taste good?
Tell him I' m not interested in being lunch!
- OK.
Heee...
- Stop talking to him!
What is going on?
I' il check.
Whaaat...
You can' t speak whale!
- Yes, I can!
- No, you can' t!
You think you can do these things, but you can' t, Nemo!
- Dory!
Oof!
He says it' s time to let go.
Everything' s gonna be all right.
How do you know?
How do you know something bad isn' t gonna happen?
I don' t!
We' re alive!
Look!
Sy- d- ney...
Sydney!
Sydney!
Sydney again!
You were right, Dory!
We made it!
We' re gonna find my son!
Thaaank yoouuu, sirrr!
Wow.
I wish I could speak whale.
All we gotta do is find the boat that took him.
- Right!
- We can do this!
Morning.
It' s morning, everyone!
Today' s the day!
The sun is shining, the tank is clean... and we are getting out...
The tank is clean.
The tank is clean!
But how?
Boss must' ve installed it while we were sleeping.
- What are we gonna do?
- What' s it say, Peach?
I can' t hear you, Peach.
The Aquascum 2003 is an all- purpose, self- cleaning... maintenance- free, salt water purifier... that is guaranteed to extend the life of your aquarium fish.
Stop it!
The Aquascum is programmed to scan... your tank environment every five minutes?!
Scan?
What does that mean?
AQUASCUM:
PH balance... normal.
Curse you, Aquascum!
That' s it for the escape plan.
It' s ruined.
Then what are we gonna do about...
ALL:
Stay down, kid!
- Whew.
My nerves can' t take much more of this.
What' il we do when that brat gets here?
- I' m thinking.
Gill!
I' m coming!
Help me!
Swim down!
Come on, kid!
- Everybody jump in!
- Swim down!
- That' s it!
- What the...?
Good work!
Gill!
- Nemo!
- Sharkbait!
- Roll, kid!
Lean!
That would' ve been a nasty fall.
Gill!
Don' t let me go belly- up!
Just calm down, Nemo.
You won' t go belly- up.
I promise.
You' re gonna be OK.
Darla!
Do any of these boats look familiar to you?
No, but the boat has to be here somewhere.
We' re gonna find it.
I' m totally excited.
Are you excited?
Wake up, come on.
Duck!
That' s not a duck.
It' s a... pelican!
No!
I didn' t come this far to be breakfast!
Hey, Nigel.
Would you look at that?
What?
Sun' s barely up and Gerald' s had more than he can handle.
Reckon somebody ought to help the poor guy.
Yeah.
Don' t everybody fly off at once.
Fish got your tongue?
- Aah!
I gotta find my son Nemo!
Nemo?
He' s that fish!
The one that' s been fighting the whole ocean!
Huh?
Come back!
Stop!
Dory, keep going!
He' s crazy!
I got something to tell you!
Mine.
Don' t make any sudden moves.
Hop inside my mouth if you want to live.
Hop in your mouth?
How does that make me live?
Mine?
NlGEL:
- Yeah, right.
I know your son.
He' s orange with a gimpy fin on one side.
- Aah!
Mine!
Mine!
Fasten your seat belts!
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
Everybody hold on!
Mine!
Mine!
Too loud!
Too loud for me!
* Twinkle, twinkle, little star *
Find a happy place!
Darla, your uncle will see you now.
All right, let' s see those pearly whites.
I' m a piranha.
They' re in the Amazon.
And a piranha' s a fish, just like your present.
* I get fishy, fishy *
Poor little guy.
- He' s dead.
- Sharkbait!
Fishy, fishy, fishy!
Must' ve left your present in the car, sweetie.
- I' il go and get it.
- He' s still alive!
- He' s not dead!
What' s happening?
Why is he playing dead?
He' s gonna get flushed down the toilet.
- He' s gonna get out of here!
- He' s gonna get flushed!
What a smart little guy!
Not the trash can!
No!
- Hey!
I found his dad!
- Where' s Nemo?
- Dentist!
- He' s over there!
What' s a dentist?
Nigel, get in there!
- I can' t go in there!
- Yes, you can!
Charge!
- What the...?
Darla, sweetie, look out!
- Hold still!
Easy!
- Hold still!
Oof!
Nemo.
Oh, my goodness.
Gotcha!
Keep down!
Nemo!
Daddy?
Out with you!
And stay out!
Daddy?
Fishy?
Fishy!
Wake up!
Oh, no!
To the top of Mount Wannahockaloogie!
Why are you sleeping?
- Hurry!
- Bloat!
Ring of Fire!
Aah!
Crikey!
All the animals have gone mad!
Get it out!
- Smack her in the head!
- Go, Gill, go!
Fish in my hair!
Gill!
Sharkbait... tell your dad I said hi.
Go get 'em!
- Yay!
- I' m so happy!
- Is he gonna be OK, Gill?
Don' t worry.
All drains lead to the ocean.
Fishy!
Daddy!
I' m so sorry.
Truly, I am.
- Hey.
I never would' ve even made it here.
So, thank you.
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait.
Where are you going?
It' s over, Dory.
We were too late.
Nemo' s gone, and I' m going home now.
No, you can' t.
Stop!
Please don' t go away.
Please?
No one' s ever stuck with me for so long before.
And if you leave, I just...
I remember things better with you.
I do.
Look...
P. Sherman, 42... 42...
I remember it.
I do.
It' s there.
I can feel it.
I' m home.
Please...
I don' t want that to go away.
I don' t want to forget.
I' m sorry, Dory, but I do.
- Manna from heaven.
- Sweet nectar of life!
Hey!
- This is our spot!
- Get outta here!
Hey!
Yeah, that' s it, fella.
Just keep on swimmin '.
You got that.
Too right, mate!
I got a live one here!
Have you seen my dad?
Hey!
Come back here!
You let him go!
Dad!
Dad!
Um, excuse me.
Are you all right?
I don' t know where I am.
I don' t know what' s going on.
I think I lost somebody, but I can' t remember.
It' s OK.
I' m looking for someone, too.
Hey, we can look together.
I' m Dory.
I' m Nemo.
Nemo?
That' s a nice name.
- Dad!
- Dad!
Wait a minute.
Is it your dad or my dad?
- My dad.
- Got it.
Dad!
- Where are we, anyway?
Dad!
Shi...
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Nemo!
Aah!
You' re Nemo!
Yes, yes, I' m Nemo!
You' re Nemo!
You were dead.
I saw you.
And here you are!
I found you.
You' re not dead.
And your father...
Your father!
You know my father?!
Where is he?
This way!
He went this way.
Quick!
Have you seen an orange fish swim by?
- It looks just like him!
- But bigger!
Yeah, I saw him, bluey.
But I' m not tellin 'you where he went... and there' s no way you' re gonna make me.
Mine.
All right!
Aah!
Hey, look out!
I' m sorry.
I' m just trying to get home.
NEMO, DlSTANTLY:
Dad!
Nemo?
- Daddy!
- Nemo?
- Dad!
- Nemo' s alive!
Dory?
Nemo!
Daddy!
I' m coming, Nemo!
- Dad!
- Nemo!
Thank goodness.
It' s all right, son.
It' s gonna be OK.
Turn around!
You' re going the wrong way!
Look out!
He- e- elp!
- Dory!
- Come on!
DORY:
Help!
Aah!
Dory!
- Dad, I know what to do!
No!
We have to tell all the fish to swim down together!
- Get out of there now!
- I know this will work!
No, I am not gonna lose you again!
There' s no time!
It' s the only way to save Dory!
I can do this.
You' re right.
I know you can.
- Lucky fin!
- Now, go!
Hurry!
Tell all the fish to swim down!
Well?
You heard my son!
Come on!
Swim down together!
Do you understand what I' m saying to you?
Swim down!
Everybody swim down!
Come on, you have to swim down!
Down!
Swim down!
Swim down!
Swim down!
Don' t give up!
Keep swimming!
Just keep swimming!
That' s it!
It' s working!
Keep swimming!
Keep swimming!
Just keep swimming!
Keep swimming!
Come on, Dad!
- You' re doing great, son!
- That' s my dad.
Let' s get to the bottom!
Keep swimming!
* Just keep swimming, just keep swimming *
Almost there!
Keep swimming!
Keep swimming!
Keep swimming!
Where' s Nemo?
- There!
Nemo!
Nemo?
Nemo?
It' s OK.
Daddy' s here.
Daddy' s got you.
Daddy?
Oh, thank goodness.
Dad...
I don' t hate you.
I' m so sorry, Nemo.
- Hey, guess what?
- What?
Sea turtles...
I met one.
And he was 150 years old.
- Yep.
Sandy Plankton said they only live to be 100.
Sandy Plankton?
Do you think I would cross the entire ocean... and not know as much as Sandy Plankton?
- He was 150!
Not 100!
Who is this Sandy Plankton who knows everything?
Let' s go!
Get up!
Let' s go!
- I' m gonna win!
- No, you' re not!
- I did it!
- Aw, my own son beats me!
Climb aboard, explorers.
The sea cucumber looks over to the mollusk and says...
"With fronds like these, who needs anemones?"
Hello, Nemo.
Who' s this?
- Exchange student.
- I' m from the E. A. C., dude!
- Sweet!
- Totally.
Seriously, Marty.
Did you really do all the things you say you did?
Pardon me.
- Ohh.
Don' t be alarmed.
We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely.
- Thanks, guys.
- See you next week.
- Keep up with the program.
- Remember, fish are friends...
Not food!
Bye!
Hold on, here we go!
Next stop... knowledge!
Bye, son!
Have fun!
Bye, Dad!
Mr. Ray, wait.
I forgot something.
Love you, Dad.
I love you, too, son.
Dad?
You can let go now.
Sorry.
Go have an adventure.
Good- bye!
See ya later, dudes!
- Bye, Elmo!
- Nemo.
- Bye, Nemo!
- See you after school, Dory!
Bye, Dad!
Bye, son.
Barbara, I don' t understand it.
Here this thing has a lifetime guarantee... and it breaks!
I had to clean the tank myself, take all the fish out... put 'em in bags, and...
Where' d the fish go?
- Come on, Peach!
- Hurry!
- You can do it!
- That' s it.
Just a little further.
That' s the shortest red light I' ve ever seen!
Aah!
Now what?
* Somewhere *
* Beyond the sea *
* Somewhere, waitin 'for me *
* My lover stands on golden sands *
* And watches the ships *

While Zé was earning the respect of the locals...
Benny was winning Angelica' s heart.
I was still a virgin and broke I had no other choice.
THE LlFE OF A SUCKER
I found a job in a supermarket.
I was working for just a few nickels.
I wanted to be fired... to buy a camera with the compensation.
But my fate was different.
The guy from the beach!
Do you still smoke?
Kid!
Pull your shirt.
Is this a thank you?
- My compensation?
The fucking manager thought I participated.
Beat it!
I did not get a dime.
A message from God.
"Honesty is punished, sucker."
FLlRTlNG WlTH CRlME
The bus is late.
I should have been at work.
- Hide the gun!
Are you mad?
- It' s broken.
- It is not our fault.
- It is never anyone' s fault!
But we pay the price.
Goodnight, lady.
He will recognise us.
He doesn' t care!
Aren' t you From the City of God?
Only one need pay.
Study - only this way can you leave the ghetto.
- Do you study?
- I attended school and then I joined the army.
Then, I found this job.
I have knowledge of karate.
If I find a job elsewhere I will leave the ghetto.
Do you wrestle?
I am peaceful.
But if I have to...
But I will talk about Knockout later.
Bye.
- I couldn' t, he was cool.
- He is Gerson' s brother.
Let' s go home.
There is only a bakery here.
- What are you going to say?
- I don' t know...
"Robbery!"
- My phone.
- Prefer soul or groovie?
She flirted with me.
I couldn' t pull the gun, she was so sweet.
I am lost.
"The guy from Sao Paolo was unlucky", I thought.
That' s where we are going, too.
You are saving me.
Everybody from Sao Paolo is a nasty pice of work.
We found the body, officer!
Not a pretty sight, eh?
Awesome singer.
Do you?
You like pot too?
Never tried.
I thought so.
- Do you have paper?
- I have some.
I was a professor in rolling joints.
If only i was like that with girls!
I would not be a virgin still.
For a guy from Sao Paolo you' re cool.
What did they kill them with?
With a bat or a rock.
- They did not hurt it.
- How long ago?
- About four hours.
Shall we take it?
The murder must be from the City of God.
Motherfucker!
Cops are coming!
It was a matter of honour.
Her parents gave me away.
Asshole!
You punished him enough, Zé.
Whoever kills in my ghetto, dies.
He had issues, Zé.
Leave the ghetto.
You showed disrespect!
The snake will bite you, Benny.
- He was useless.
- A dirty traitor.
I am going for a walk with the girl.
Take care.
When things calm down... we will deal with Redhead again.
Get a girlfriend, Zé.
- Do you know what I am thinking?
- That I am sexy?
Do you know what we can do?
- I am serious.
Get out of here.
I hate violence.
- And go where?
- To a farm.
we are hippies at heart.
To a farm?
Peace and love?
BENNY' S FAREWELL
Benny was too cool to be a gangster.
With his party he managed to bring everyone together.
Gangs.. soul fans..
religious people..
Some day I' il go to the church.
Samba fans..
Groovies..
And Zé who danced for the first time in his life.
Wanna dance?
- I can' t hear you.
- Are you dancing?
Thanks, I got company.
I want to talk to you.
You are not going away with that chick.
I' il live on a farm, I' il smoke pot, and listen to rock.
Are you going to ruin everything for a bitch?
She' s my girl.
I will kill Redhead, the bastard.
You think that everybody is a bastard that is why I leave!
I am your friend but I am leaving.
Try to understand.
I love you but that' s all.
Show me your balls, man!
Beat it!
Put your pants down nigger!
I wanna see your ass!
Come on you faggot!
Show us your ass!
Put them down!
The camera for a bag of coke?
- No more shit.
- You' re my friend.
- Is it stolen?
- My father' s.
- Give it to Zé.
- Rocket will probably want it.
Here I am!
You want to be a photographer?
Here' s a present.
Awesome!
Shake your ass!
you' re gonna shoot fine photos.
Bring it here.
- Give me the camera!
- No.
They killed Benny!
Call an ambulance!
Who the fuck did it?
Zé, Benny is dead.
It' s your fault bitch!
- Where is Redhead?
- Blackie came.
I' il fuck her.
- Why?
- We' re both fucked.
I think i killed Benny.
We can catch up with him in the disco.
- Did you kill Benny?
I aimed at Zé.
You killed the coolest gangster in the City.
without Benny, Redhead was dead.
We' re fucked, man.
Where else could a miracle happen if not in the City of God?
Hallo dall.
Gimme a kiss.
Let me pass.
Have you ever seen your face?
All' s well baby?
It was simple as that.
Zé was ugly.
Knockout Ned was handsome.
Knockout had whoever he wanted.
Zé had to use violence.
A duel between the good and charming... the bad and ugly.
Let me go!
Enjoy it.
No need to resist.
You are mine now.
Your girlfriens is hot, lucky bastard.
I cannot even look at her.
Why didn' t the motherfucker kill me?
Why didn' t I kill the asshole?
- Let' s go back.
- And Redhead?
- We' il be back.
- Are you going to kill him?
Knockout, get out
Take it easy.
Let me go.
Gerson, come back!
None of your business, kid.
It is your brother we want!
My brother is peaceful!
Tell him to come out!
He did nothing.
Do you know who I am?
I' m Zé!
Bring the mother fucker!
Cool down, I' il bring him.
He asked for it.
The bastard killed my brother!
I won' t let it go.
Need a gun?
- My child!
- Take it easy mom.
- Do it right.
- There is no other way.
- How could he hit me?
- That' s a bad hole.
You were hit by one brother me by the other!
Knockout isn' t bad.
He came out of nowhere.
You give me a headache, Tuba!
God bless you.
The kid went looking for trouble.
You did a fine job.
You have to hide.
I though Knockout would start a revolution here.
But God had other plans.
Steak, where did the dealers disappear?
They are hiding.
Zé is not in a good mood.
- Bring me a chocolate.
- I' il try.
Tell her that Siago is looking for her.
Steak, go tell Redhead... that Zé says if you kill Knockout he' il leave you alone.
- Did you hear this Knockout?
- Get the kid!
If you don' t stay with us, you' re dead.
Come with us.
We' il be partners.
It' s between me and him.
They' d do anything fot power.
Like the Kid here they are all like robots.
Do you have shit inside your head?
Don' t you understand that you are wasted with this maniac?
You are kiddo!
Kid, huh?
I am a man!
Come with us
We will slice you, Steak.
Ok, I accept.
Tell him that Redhead and Knockout are in charge.
With one condition:
I don' t kill innocents.
- I won' t tolerate it.
- OK, no innocents.
Steak is fucked up.
- Have you got a gun?
- We' il rob a gun store.
I don' t rob anything.
I am not a gangster.
I have something personal with him
I am not a robber.
He raped your girl, he killed your brother... he hit your house and you killed an acolyte of his.
Unless you are a robber, get out.
KNOCKOUT NED' S HlSTORY
Robbery!
The first time...
Bring the revolvers!... Knockout Ned saved a dealer from Redhead.
We said no killings.
It' s a rule!
We want boss' money!
Open the fund!
Do you want to leave?
We also want it.
The second time, Redhead saved Knockout
Ned learned that rules have exceptions.
An exception.
Are you the director?
Robbery!
Everybody down!
The third time, the exception became a rule.
Redhead would protect his busines.
Knockout, the best shooter, wanted revenge.
The Italian first.
This is 9mm.
- It' s not aligned.
- You 'il get it at a good price.
This is a 12mm.
We call it 'crap'.
Uzi, 9mm.
From Israel.
David' s star.
I want a 30- 06.
It' s party time!
The war begins.
Lets pray.
Our Father, who art in heaven... hallowed be thy name...
Gangsters have the guns but they don' t shoot.
Knockout' s one bullet was like ten of Zé' s bullets.
Zé couldn' t stand it.
He attacked.
The ghetto was like Hell before but now it had become Hell!
I decided to go out.
That' s how I became a journalist.
Nice picture!
That' s Rogerio Ris' for sure.
What was I saying?
As every professional...
I started from the lower level, from the bottom.
Without knowing what was ahead of me...
Instead if going home I went to the newspaper' s offices.
Someone from the City Of God worked at the laboratory.
He helped me to fulfil the dream of my life.
Photographer.
- He is an admirer of yours.
- You have a good taste, Rocket.
I am leaving.
Nice guy!
A personal revenge leaded to war.
The City of God has been divided.
You couldn' t cross it.
Not to go to a relative.
Those who lived to the ghetto were considered as gangsters.
We were living our own Vietnam.
Volunteers were giving their lives.
The Kids.
Somebody hit me.
The war was forgiving everything.
One of Zé' s guys kicked me.
Take this.
He raped my sister...
- Zé took our home.
- Kill for your pride.
I am Siago, Benny' s friend.
You know how to read?
Spell?
- I am good.
- You are hired.
To have revenge on my father' s killer.
- What' s your name?
- My name is Oto.
What' s happening?
- He works.
- He needs a gun.
He won' t last a week.
A year later, nobody remembered how it all started.
The aim was, to undertake enemy' s business... to buy guns and to extend the enterprise.
I sniff, I killed, I stole.
I am man!
The TV showed interest.
The police would intervene.
A gangster from the city of God, was arrested.
Manuel Massando also known as Knockout Ned... is at hospital after an attack of Zé' s gang.
He gave us an interview.
- Does the war continue?
- Yes, it continues.
Were many people killed?
Many.
Innocent mostly.
If a person knowns me that' s enough for Zé to kill him.
- Are the police absent?
- They hunt me, not him.
I am in jail while he kills people without thinking.
Knockout Ned believes that the war will continue.
Cops promised to dislocate the gangs.
I am the boss and he is in the newspaper!
- Did you find mine?
- Knockout' s only.
My name must be somewhere.
- Can you read?
Nothing.
- What the Hell are you doing?
Read everything!
- There are no articles!
- Do you want to be shot?
We' il show them who is the boss!
Give me the camera!
- Take me a picture.
- I don' t know how it works.
Take me.
Back...
- It doesn' t click.
- You fools.
You fucked me, assholes.
I' il call an acquaintance.
He came.
Take the camera.
Well, kid?
Aren' t you a photographer?
Take us a picture.
- You broke it.
- Not me.
Needs some fixing.
- What' s your name?
- Rocket.
Pull one more.
Two lines.
With your guns.
- You' re out, damnit!
- Speak kindly.
- Show us the pictures.
- We must develop these photos.
How much does it cost?
Take this money and bring the pictures.
- I have to remove the film.
- Hold the camera.
Benny wanted to give it to you.
It is yours.
Don' t forget the pictures.
Can you develop this film?
I can' t, Rocket, I' il get in trouble.
I' il get fired.
And this.
I am going for lunch.
You are lucky.
Dimensions?
For the enlargement.
Whatever you think is better.
I am in big trouble.
I am dead.
Somebody signed his conviction.
I would smash his face!
You stole my pictures!
They will kill me!
What are you talking about?
They' il kill me because of you!
The pictures were at the laboratory.
Everything t hat is in the laboratory is for publication.
- I saw them, I published them.
- You stole them.
- Give them to me.
- Here, take them.
- Don' t you have more?
- Relax.
What' s your name?
Rocket?
Nice to meet you, Marina.
I' ve got your money.
When a picture is published we pay the photographer.
Do you want to become a photographer?
Nice start with a frontpage!
- How did you take them?
- I live there.
Not even one photographer managed to go to the ghetto.
If you bring more pictures of Zé... the newspaper will buy them.
- Can you?
- I don' t know.
- What' s the problem?
- I can' t go there again at night.
- And the day?
- It is a risk.
At last they understood that I' m the Boss.
What' s the name of this photographer friend of yours?
He is good.
I' il take to show you.
Yes, or not?
It' s a big chance.
You took the right decision.
I' il give you films, lenses and another camera.
Come to see the equipment office.
There is another problem also.
Where am I going to sleep tonight?
I can' t go back.
This one is 135mm.
Do you shoot from near or from a distance?
- Can you measure the light?
Don' t you think you are too close?
I don' t know how i managed to talk to them like this.
Maybe I was about to die but I had a camera... and a chance to become a photographer.
What is more, he had the whole night for us.
- Do you want to eat something?
- No thanks.
Won' t you eat, or drink?
A joint?
Try this.
Time to sleep.
- I' il show you your bed - Have you got hot water?
Yes, haven' t you tried a hot bath?
We got boiling water in a saucepan.
- Why are you standing there?
- In which room am I going to sleep?
Unfortunately, I have only one room.
We will sleep together.
I won' t tell you much about my first sexual experience.
Somewhere else, another one, a more important erotic scene was taking place.
Redhead was helping Knockout to escape. without a shot.
The guard was at the hands of the nurse.
Meanwhile, Zé was investing on ammo...
To terminate Redhead.
He was heavily equipped even though he didn' t have to pay.
Do you remember the shotgun?
It is a semi automatic shotgun.
You haven' t seen a Brouning like this.
It can even shoot down airplanes.
I want what I asked for.
The american ÁR- 15.
They don' t exist in Brazil.
- I don' t give a shit.
Rouger Have you seen this before?
Same calibre but lighter.
With infrared vision?
400 blasts per minute?
Are you trying to fool me?
I' il fuck you.
Go now, no money no guns.
What am I supposed to say to the boss?
- Your problem. Think of something.
Beat it, Fatty
Zé made a big mistake he didn' t know that...
Behind every dealer there is a big trader.
Did you see this?
Why do they want an ÁR- 15?
They will make investigations, cops. We' il get busted.
Do you think that i will betray you?
I' il fix it, but don' t get involved again.
Come here.
Tell him...
Let' s go now to the fucking dealer.
Come here, kids.
- Do you like chicken?
- It depends.
Redhead.
I have a gift for you.
- One big for you.
- Are you giving us guns?
Yes, but I want you beside me against Redhead.
- Can we steal later?
- Not at the ghetto.
- Do you know how to shoot?
- More or less.
Come to help the kids!
I know.
You do it like this.
THE BEGlNING OF THE END
Grab the chicken!
If Zé catches you he' il kill you.
He has to find me first.
Kid, grab the chicken!
- The Cops!
- Don' t run away!
Butthead!
Fuckin faggot!
Get the Hell outta here!
Let them kill each other
Rocket!
Take us a picture!
Why are you standing like this?
Kill the motherfucker!
- It hurts!
Relax, Kid!
Why did you join this fuckin 'war?
Knockout Ned!
Zé is down!
Hang on, I' il help you.
- What' s your name - My name is Otto.
I want revenge for my father' s death.
Zé' s down!
Hang on.
Cops!
Hands behind your head!
- It' s you that i want.
- You' re through, pal.
Handcuffs on him.
- Rocket, where' re you going; - I got something to do.
We got some arragments to do, Zé.
You' re the gift for the Media.
- Is it 10, 000?
That' s all i got.
That' s all, Boss.
We looked everywhere.
Let him go.
Is it gold?
Fuck it.
You owe us the rest.
Fuckin war!
Knockout Ned is dead and I' m broke!
You' re fucked, right?
We' il do some robberies to get back my position.
- Your position, Zé?
- Is it tough for you, boy?
For our friend, motherfucker!
Attack!
We are the Bosses!
That photograph will make a professional.
That photograph will make me famous.
Maybe it becomes a front page of a magazine.
I won' t worry about Zé anymore.
But the police?
"The Boss of the city of God, falls dead..."
That photograph it could kill us?
- It gave you work.
- It made me internal.
- You made some money, right?
- Yeah, some..
- That journalist?
Was she good?
- Good enough.
- You didn' t like it?
- How would they know about fuckin?
Cocoa stole three houses at Bara.
Let' s do him.
- Who killed Roger?
- Bif.
Let' s kill the Boss and Gringo.
It' s just the two of us plus three more...
Have you ever heard of the Red Brigade?
No, but if they come we' il do 'em.
- Who knows how to write?
- Me, a little.
Let' s make a Black List.
Add in the List Nightbird And Leonard!
And The Chinese, he thinks he' s too important.
Claudio also!
Where is Giant?
I forgot to tell you, my name is not Rocket any more.
I' m Wilson Rodriguez.
Photographer.
BASED ON A TRUE STORY:
Manuel Assando also known as Knockout Ned, was hospitilised... after he was' injured 'by Zé' s men.
He gave us an interview.
Many died.
Mostly innocent.
Just for knowing me... just for being my friends.
If someone thinks that he knows me, he' s dead.
- Where are the police?
- They' re after me, not him.
I went three times to jail while he kills undisturbed.
They don' t arrest him.
Knockout Ned claims that the war will be continued.
Police officers promised to take down... both gangs at the City Of God.
THREE COLORS RED
Come here.
320 04 86.
Leave your name and number and I' II get back to you.
Valentine?
Valentine?
Are you there?
I' il call back later.
Michel...
I was having breakfast.
First it was busy, now the machine.
Are you alone?
Alone.
All alone?
AII alone.
They just called me for a photo session.
They want to see me.
When did you get back?
Yesterday.
I called, but you weren' t home.
Our car was stolen in Poland.
They got everything: passports, money, clothes...
So what happened?
We found a nice guy who put us up.
The Embassy gave us money and passports.
We made it home.
Michel?
I felt lonely last night.
What did you do?
All night long I slept with your jacket.
I wanted to be with you.
I can' t now, Valentine.
I know.
What' s the weather like there?
Typical English weather: it' s pouring.
It rained here yesterday.
Now it' s sunny.
It' s springtime.
What did you do last night?
I took your advice and saw The Dead Poets Society,
What a good movie!
I liked it a lot.
I' il call you tonight.
I' il be back at 7.
I' il stay in.
I' il talk to you later.
I miss you.
Me too.
Personal weather reports.
Hello.
Lose?
Take that out.
Take your sweater.
Tie it around your neck.
The sleeve too.
Like this?
Give me a profile.
No, don' t smile.
Be sad.
Sadder.
Think of something awful.
There.
Sad.
Now it' s coming.
That' s it.
Turn.
And 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and stretch, and 6 and 7 and 8 and bend, and 3 and 4 and arch, and 6 and 7 and stretch, and stretch and stretch.
Stretch out your chin, your arm, your fingertips.
Stretch out your hand, your neck.
Relax your toes.
Stretch.
I almost fell.
Excuse me... the door was open.
I' m sorry.
I ran over your dog.
Rita.
A German shepherd.
That' s possible.
She disappeared yesterday.
She' s in my car.
Alive.
I don' t know what to do.
Should I take her to a veterinarian?
As you wish.
If I ran over your daughter, would you be so indifferent?
I have no daughter, Miss.
Go away.
Don' t close the door.
She' s fine.
We stitched her up.
Otherwise, she has a few bruises.
She' il need some rest.
She' s pregnant.
Will you take her or leave her here?
I' il take her.
We' il help you carry her.
Marc...
Are you alone?
No.
Tell him something.
Did you hear?
I have a dog.
A dog.
I ran her over.
Michel, I' m sorry.
That wasn' t funny.
No, it wasn' t.
I knew it was a joke.
I could see you laughing.
Do you remember how we met?
I remember...
We' re lucky I stepped out during the break.
That' s true.
Valentine, return the dog.
I tried.
The owner doesn' t want it.
Who is he?
I hear an alarm.
It' s my car.
Wait for me to turn it off.
I' m in a rush.
I understand.
Move.
Move.
They prefer these.
They' il use the slogan:
"A Breath of Life".
Which do you prefer?
I like this one.
Me too.
25 by 65 feet.
Will people recognize you?
Who?
Who are you thinking of?
Not you.
That' s a bad sign.
I think I know why I won.
Goodbye.
So long.
You' re back already.
The mailman left money for you.
Who sent it?
I have no idea.
Isn' t that your brother?
Or someone who looks like him.
What a shame.
Does your family read this paper?
I don' t know.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Can I speak to Marie, please?
It' s Valentine.
Will you see Marc soon?
Tonight, probably.
Tell him to call me at any hour.
I' il let you run around.
But don' t run away.
You promise?
Go on.
Excuse me.
My dog ran away.
Call her.
She' s yours.
- Was it you?
- For the vet.
- You found my address?
- That was easy.
You don' t know the prices.
It cost 130 francs.
You sent me 600.
Wait.
I' il get the change.
What about Rita?
She' s a very intelligent dog.
Take her.
- You don' t want her?
- I want nothing.
Then stop breathing.
Good idea.
You don' t breathe anymore?
If you don' t come, you' il never see me again.
But today is Sunday.
Yesterday was Saturday and we were together.
I' m sorry, Sir.
We' re about to have lunch.
I ask one thing of you: don' t call me "Sir".
Talk to me like yesterday.
Call me Pierrot.
Call me "my love".
Say "my love"...
Sir, let me change rooms.
Pierre, I' m alone now.
So am I.
Far from you.
I want you to come.
I can' t be alone...
I saw you yesterday.
I miss you too.
Understand that.
I don' t want to.
I' m thinking of you.
You' re naked in front of the mirror.
But for someone else, not for me.
I want to kiss you.
I lean forward,
I touch your lips...
What are you doing?
I' m spying.
What?
I' m listening to my neighbors' phone calls.
You cut it off just as it was getting interesting.
You don' t find it entertaining?
It' s disgusting.
Yes.
What' s more, it' s illegal.
Your 30 francs.
One minute, Miss.
You' re persuaded you are right.
Yes.
Then why don' t you do anything?
What?
like yesterday?
Go see this man.
Tell him someone listens to his conversations.
While you' re at it, tell him it' s me.
I will.
It' s that house.
May I see your husband?
He' s upstairs on the phone.
Let me shut off the gas.
Come in, please.
Have a seat.
He' il be right down.
Caroline, don' t play...... with the phone.
Daddy' s talking.
Excuse me.
I' m at the wrong address.
This is number 22.
I' m very sorry.
No problem.
Have a nice day.
Goodbye.
I' il call you later.
You lost this.
So?
Did you tell him?
Would you like something to drink?
No, I wouldn' t.
I came back...
I came back to ask you something.
Don' t do this any more.
I' ve done it all my life.
What were you?
A cop?
Worse.
A judge.
A judge?
You' ve never seen one for real?
Would you like to try?
It makes... a lovely sound.
I don' t know whether I was on the good or the bad side.
Here, at least, I know where the truth is.
My point of view is better than in a courtroom.
No.
Everyone deserves a private life.
Of course.
Why did you stop short?
Why didn' t you tell him?
Because he has a sweet wife, devoted to him?
And a little daughter who loves him?
So you couldn' t.
Did you feel remorse... or were you afraid to do harm?
Maybe both.
Let me tell you.
It matters little whether I spy or you tell them.
Sooner or later, he' il jump out a window, or she' il find out everything.
Someone will tell their daughter and it will be living hell.
What can we do about it?
Why are you so quiet?
Does this remind you of something?
- Yes.
- What?
Say it.
A boy I know.
A boy you know who... found out his mother was a whore?
Who learned... he' s not his father' s son.
He was fifteen.
That man' s daughter... she knows too.
Stay a minute.
Why?
The light is beautiful.
Personal weather reports.
I' m driving to Turin tomorrow.
I checked.
The weather will be fine to Chamonix.
From Chamonix to the tunnel, it may snow.
And after the tunnel... one minute...
I know the weather all over Europe.
Up to Turin, the weather will be fine.
Leave early to avoid the snow.
This service is a great idea.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Personal weather reports.
It' s me.
Did you get any sleep?
A little.
I didn' t tell you.
By telephone it may be easier.
It was really great.
We' d never made love so well, so long.
We learned something.
Me from you.
You from me.
When I woke up, you were still sleeping.
Like a child.
I' m older than you.
- One year!
- No, two.
Okay.
Two.
When I saw you, I got scared.
What is this leading to?
You sound a little down.
Are you nervous about your exams?
About what I' m going to do.
Will it be enough for you?
Why not go bowling?
I opened all my books.
Maybe.
Do you have a coin?
Yes.
Flip it.
Heads is Penal Code.
Tails.
Bowling.
I' il work for an hour, then I' il call you.
Or I will.
I' il wait.
If I go out, it' s just to buy cigarettes.
You didn' t listen?
What a shame.
It was romantic.
I heard the beginning.
They' re in love.
Yes.
He hasn' t met the right woman yet.
How do you know?
I watch them from my window.
You think I' m a bastard?
Yes.
Come look.
He bought a telephone in Japan that uses another wavelength.
My radio can' t pick it up.
Too bad.
I think he' s responsible for most of the heroin trade in Geneva.
We have nothing on him.
He never takes risks.
Do you like him?
Very much.
I' il call him.
You have his phone number?
You deserve to die.
What did I do?
Here' s his phone number.
If you feel like saying mean things to him, don' t hesitate.
At 10 o' clock, I turned off the lights.
I couldn' t sleep.
Next program.
Not very interesting.
I kept tossing and turning.
It kept hurting.
It still does.
I haven' t done the errands.
I' m sorry, mother.
I have no milk or bread.
I bought you some.
I put it in the freezer.
I ate it all.
You didn' t eat 7 loaves...... in 4 days.
I' m sick of this.
Go do her errands.
Maybe you' d feel better.
Maybe she' s the one...... who' d feel better.
Why did you pick up Rita?
Because I' d run over her.
She was bleeding.
Otherwise, you' d have felt guilty.
You' d have dreamt of a dog with a crushed skull.
Yes.
So who did you do it for?
Don' t bother doing that lady' s errands.
She has everything she needs.
She wants to see her daughter.
She already came 5 times, when her mother faked a heart attack.
After she dies, I' il have to call the daughter.
She doesn' t believe her any more.
You' re mistaken.
About what?
About everything.
Everything.
People aren' t bad.
It' s not true.
Yes.
They may be weak sometimes...
The boy who learned his father wasn' t his father... your boyfriend or your brother?
My brother.
How old is he?
16.
How long has he been shooting up?
How do you know?
It wasn' t hard to guess.
I can only feel pity for you.
Maybe you don' t know.
Your dog is pregnant.
It' s Valentine.
Hello, darling.
Mom, did Marc come?
Two days ago.
With his girlfriend.
Do you know her?
Yes.
Marie.
We' re all together.
They' re watching TV.
I' m sorry I can' t be there.
Too bad.
It' s like old times.
Your brother' s a good boy.
Can I talk to him?
Marc!
He' s coming.
Call me, Mom.
I love you.
Hi, Valentine.
Thanks for going there.
We' re leaving tomorrow.
I can' t stand it.
Mom didn' t see the paper?
I don' t think so.
She' d never believe it...
You' re right.
You should go home.
Bye.
Call me, Michel.
Please, call me.
Dld you see the picture?
The picture?
Is that you, Jacques?
Isn' t it amazing?
You didn' t see it?
I forgot.
I' ve had a hard day.
Come meet us.
It' il relax you.
Where?
Not bad!
I' m sorry to bother you...
Someone played a stupid prank.
I can' t get in.
Those kids...
Turks.
Always trouble.
I don' t know.
They stuck chewing gum in my lock.
Tweezers.
It' s me.
Michel...
I just called.
There was no answer.
Someone stuck chewing gum in my lock.
I heard the phone.
Chewing gum?
I did an ad for chewing gum.
That must be why.
I told you not to.
They take advantage of you.
Forget it.
There was no answering machine.
All I want is peace.
A life of peace and quiet.
Life won' t be peaceful with me.
Did you meet someone?
No.
I' m waiting for you.
Why didn' t you answer before?
I told you.
I couldn' t get inside.
I understand.
How are you?
I' m going to Hungary next week.
What are you doing?
I' m going to bed.
Go ahead!
Go on!
Are you there?
Michel, are you there?
It' s starting again...
Are you asleep?
No, I' m not.
Get into bed.
Are you in bed?
I' m taking a shower.
I was getting undressed.
No one is helping you?
Valentine, are you there?
No.
Goodnight.
I knew you' d make it.
Did they ask the question?
From the book you dropped in the street.
You don' t like it?
Yes.
Very much.
What will be the first judgement I sign?
Civil hearing.
Please enter.
I' d like number 432.
Van den Budenmayer.
- Did I pronounce it right?
- Yes.
This one?
I just sold the last one.
I' il have others this afternoon.
I can set one aside.
Whose paper is this?
Yours.
I came...
I saw the newspaper...
I want you to know I didn' t tell a soul.
I know.
No one.
Not the police.
No one.
I know.
I know who it was.
Who?
It was me.
You asked me to.
Won' t you come in?
Let me show you something.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Seven?
Seven.
Won' t you have some pear brandy?
I' ve had it for ages, but I' ve never had an occasion.
To my health.
Why did you do it?
Why did I turn myself in?
Yes.
To see what you' d do once you saw it in your paper.
You thought...... I would come?
After our last conversation, I thought so.
Why?
Do you expect something from me?
Yes.
Before you left, you mentioned pity.
Afterwards, I realized it was disgust.
Will you sit down for a moment?
Will you smile for me?
The day you left, you cried.
I cried.
And I shut off my radio.
I sat down at my desk.
The fountain pen I' d used all my life was out of ink, so I took a pencil and wrote letters to my neighbors and to the police.
I mailed them that evening.
While you were sleeping soundly.
I wasn' t sleeping.
I had gone bowling.
Do you remember that couple' s conversation?
The boy and the girl?
I remember.
They wanted to go too.
That same evening.
Maybe you were right next to them.
Maybe.
You didn' t like her.
It' s almost over.
I was right.
You seem happy about it.
Did you provoke it?
Yes or no?
Because of my eavesdropping and my trial, the girl met another man.
Good day.
Since then, she' s been alone.
I asked my brother to go see her.
He stayed three days.
In one week I' m going to England.
I' m abandoning my mother and my brother.
Every day he gets a little worse.
I shouldn' t leave.
Leave.
It' s your destiny.
You can' t live your brother' s life for him.
I love him.
If only I could help.
You can.
Be.
What do you mean?
That' s all: be.
Do you like flying?
Then take the ferry.
I' ve never taken one.
It' s less expensive and healthier.
That' s a good idea.
Do you like it?
Today is my birthday.
I didn' t know.
A sailor.
One of my first big cases.
It was a tough time in my life.
I have since realized I made a mistake.
He was guilty.
I' m all out of bulbs.
What happened to him?
I did my own investigation.
He' s married with three children.
A grandson.
He is living in peace.
So you did what was necessary.
And you did it well.
Don' t you understand?
You saved him.
Perhaps.
But how many others could I have acquitted?
Even guilty?
Deciding what is true and what isn' t now seems to me...... a lack of modesty.
Vanity?
Vanity.
Can I have a drop?
To you!
If I had to go to court... are there still judges like you?
You won' t go to court.
Justice doesn' t deal with the innocent.
See that?
It' s the sixth window they' ve broken.
The wavelength has been changed.
I can no longer eavesdrop.
Where is the broom?
In the kitchen closet.
Put the stone on the piano.
You' re not afraid?
I wonder what I' d do in their place.
The same thing.
You' d throw stones?
In their place?
Of course.
And that goes for everyone I judged.
I' d kill, I' d lie.
Of course I would.
All that because I wasn' t...... in their shoes, but mine.
Is there someone you love?
Have you ever loved?
Yesterday I dreamt...
I dreamt of you.
You were 40 or 50 years old, and you were happy.
Do your dreams come true?
It' s been years since I dreamt something nice.
Stay there!
I bought a ticket for the ferry.
I arrive in England next Wednesday.
At 7: 30 a. m.
Why the ferry?
So I can visit my mother near Calais.
I' il meet you at 8: 00.
I' m happy you' re coming.
Michel, tell me... do you love me?
I think so.
You love me or you think so?
It' s the same thing.
The battery.
Auguste!
Personal weather reports.
I' ve tried calling for a few days.
I' m sorry.
What will the weather be on the English Channel next week?
Wonderful.
Sunny, a slight breeze, chilly in the morning.
Why are you laughing?
I intend to go there.
Even farther.
For your work?
No, for pleasure.
On a yacht.
It' s a nice sail.
Yes, very.
You' il be closing?
I' il have to.
That' s too bad.
It was a good idea.
Goodbye.
We told you not to smile!
Be serious!
Can you send an invitation to this address?
Just one person?
Are you okay?
- So long.
- Have a good time.
There' s no make- up remover?
Here.
Everyone noticed...... that guy.
During the entire show I kept staring at him.
You came.
You knew the invitation came from me?
I' d hoped so.
Did you look for me?
During the entire show.
I' m leaving tomorrow.
I wanted to say goodbye.
Goodbye.
I' d like you to tell me in detail...... the dream you had.
You were 50 years old and you were happy.
In this dream... was there someone else?
There was.
Who?
You woke up and you smiled at someone next to you.
I don' t know who.
That' s what will happen?
In 20 or 25 years?
Yes.
What else do you know?
Who are you?
A retired judge.
I feel something important is happening around me.
And it scares me.
Is that better?
I used to come here often.
Where did you usually sit?
Where I sat today.
That' s why you couldn' t see me.
One day, during the intermission, the elastic holding my books broke.
One of them, a big one, fell down... somewhere around here.
I ran down immediately.
The book had opened to a certain page.
I read a few sentences.
It was the question they asked during my exam.
Getting out of the house did you good.
I had to recharge the battery.
It was dead.
The storm.
Lousy coffee.
I was wondering...... why you mentioned that sailor.
Do you know why?
Yes.
Because...... you didn' t want to tell me something more important.
About the woman that you loved.
She betrayed you.
She betrayed you, and you never understood why.
And you kept on loving her.
How do you know all this?
It wasn' t hard to guess.
What was she like?
She graduated two years before me.
She was blond, delicate, radiant, with a long neck.
Her clothing and her furniture were all light- colored.
In the foyer there was a mirror in a white frame.
It was in that mirror, one night, that I saw her white legs spread, with a man between them.
Why...... did that happen?
Do you know?
This man, whose name was Hugo Holbling,
could offer her what she wanted.
They left.
I followed them.
I crossed France, the Channel...
I was... humiliated.
Until the day she died in an accident.
Since then, I' ve never loved another woman.
Yes.
I stopped believing.
Maybe I never met the woman...
Maybe you' re the woman I never met.
The story doesn' t end there.
No.
I was given a difficult case.
On it was written the name of the defendant:
Hugo Holbling.
The same man.
He' d come back here.
I' m closing up.
Did you see a woman with a bucket?
The storm flooded the wardrobe.
If you see her, tell her I' m upstairs.
You shouldn' t have taken the case.
I didn' t want to.
At first, I wanted to kill him.
I would have, if it would have changed something.
Now, he was waiting for my verdict.
He was building a covered market which caved in.
Several people died.
I said he was guilty.
It was a legal sentence.
Afterwards, I asked for early retirement.
Did you see her?
I' m always running after her!
Milana!
There you are!
Give me the buckets.
They' re heavy.
You seemed to like my pear brandy.
I have another favor to ask you.
I' il be gone two or three weeks.
I' il come see you afterwards.
Please give me one of the puppies.
Will the fashion show be on TV?
Probably.
I better buy a TV.
I have one I never use.
My brother can bring it to you.
His name is Marc.
I' d like to meet him.
I' il see you soon.
Goodbye.
Do you have your ticket?
Where do I go?
This deck.
That corridor.
Excuse me, I' m lost.
F38?
The deck above.

A chronicle of the Great Death of Wisborg in the year 1843 A. D.
Nosferatu!
Doesn' t this name sound like the very midnight call of Death?
Speak it not aloud, or life' s pictures will turn to pale shadows, and nightmares will rise up to feed on your blood.
I have long meditated on the rise and fall of the Great Death in my home town of Wisborg.
Here is the story:
In Wisborg there lived a man called Hutter with his young wife Ellen...
"Why have you destroyed them - the beautiful flowers?"
"Not so hasty, my young friend!
No one escapes his destiny. "
There was also a house agent called Knock, a strange man, and the center of mush gossip.
One thing was sure: he paid his people well.
"Count Orlok - His Grace - from Transylvania - wants to buy a beautiful house - in our little town..."
"You could make a nice bit of money."
"You will have a marvellous jorney - What matter if it costs you a bit of pain - or even a little blood?"
"He wants a handsome deserted house..."
"That' s house - just opposite yours.
Offer him that! "
"Leave at once, my young friend.
Have a quick journey into the land of phantoms! "
"I may be away for several month, dear Ellen, away in a country of ghosts and robbers."
Thus Hutter gave the grief- stricken woman into the care of his friends, the rich shipbuilder Harding and Ruth, his sister.
"Do not fear."
19
"My dinner - quickly - I must hasten to Count Orlok' s castle!"
"You must leave now!
The evil spirits become all- powerful after dark! "
The Book of the Vampires
From the seed of Relial came the vampire Nosferatu which liberty and feedeth on the blood of mankind and abideth, unredeemed, in horrible Darkness, on the cursed earth from the grabeyards of the Black Death.
Nosferatu, a name that ringeth like the cry of a bird of prey.
Speak it not aloud!
Men do not always recognize the dangers that beasts can sense at certain times.
"Drive on!
The sun is setting! "
"We will go no further!
Not for a fortune! "
"We will go no further!
Here begins the land of the phantoms! "
And when he had crossed the bridge, the phantoms came to meet him.
"You are late, young man.
It is almost midnight.
My servants have all retired. "
"Blood!
Your precious blood! "
"Shall we stay up together for awhile?
It is a long time until sunrise during the day, my friend, I truly sleep the deepest sleep. "
As soon as the sun rose Hutter felt himself freed from the shadows of the night.
Dearest Ellen!
Do not grieve because your beloved is far away...
... the mosquitoes are reals pests.
I have been stung at the neck by two at once, very close together, one on each side...
One' s dreams are heavy in this deserted castle, but do not fear...
With twilight the empty castle came alive again with menacing shadows.
"Your wife has a beautiful neck..."
"I shall take the house - the handsome deserted house opposite yours..."
From the seed of Relial came the vampire Nosferatu which libeth and feedeth on the blood of mankind and abideth, unredeemed, in horrorible Darkness, on the cursed earth from the grabeyards of the Black Death.
At night said Nosferatu sinketh his fangs into victim and feeds on the blood that constitues his hellish elixir of life.
At the same hour...
"Ellen!"
Thomas!
Hear me! "
"A harmless blood condition!"
The doctor described Ellen' s anxietes as if the had been trifles.
But I know that in that night her soul had heard the call of death.
Already, Nosferatu was raising his wings.
And Hutter, far away, had heard her cry of warning.
"Ellen!
Ellen! "
The raftsmen little suspected what terrible cargo they carried down the valley.
"The peasants brought him into the hospital yesterday.
They said he fell from a mountain.
He is still feverish. "
"Coffins... Coffins filled with earth."
Nosferatu was on the way, and with him catastrophe approached Wisborg.
At the same time the Paracelsian Professor Bulwer was giving a course on the secrets of nature and their strange correspondance to human life.
The professor told his students about the existence of a carnivorous plant...
"Astonishing, isn' t it a gentlemen?
That plan is the vampire of the vegetable kingdom. "
Already, Nosferatus' s drawing near semmed to affect Knock, the house agent.
"The patient who was brought in yesterday has gone out of his mind!"
"Blood is life!
Blood is life!!!! "
"And this one..."
"... a polyp with tentacles..."
"Transparent - almost without substance..."
"No more than a phantom..."
"Spiders -"
Ellen was often seen alone among the dunes.
Longing for her beloved, she searched the waves and the distant horizon.
One' s dreams are heavy in this deserted castle, but do not fear...
I am leaving immediately to return to Wisborg - and to you.
"No I have to get away - reach home by the shortest possible way!"
New Plague Baffles Science
"A sailor has fallen ill below deck.
He is talking in a fever. "
Like an epidemic it spread over the entire ship.
The first sailor who had shown the symptoms was followed by the entire crew into the dark grave of the waters.
In the light of the setting sun the captain and his first mate said farewell to the last of their companions.
"I shall go down!
If I haven' t come up again within ten minutes... "
The ship of death had a new captain
It is a difficult to imagine how young Hutter, his energies sadly dectimated, managed to surmoung the difficulties of his homeward journey.
At the same time, driven by the fatal breath of the vampire, the vessel moved rapidly toward the Baltic.
"I must go to him.
He is approaching!!! "
The Master is coming!
The Master is here! "
I have given much thought to the notion that Nosferatu travelled with coffins filled with earth.
"Thomas!
Thank God you are safe!
Now I feel that I, too have been saved. "
Varna- July 12.
Crew, apart from myself, the captain- one helmsman, one mate, and five sailors.
Departing for the Dardanellas.
2nd day:
July 13.
One sailor has contracted a fever.
Course:
SSW.
Direction of wind:
3nd day:
July 14.
Mate has begun to hallicunate, says a strange passenger is below deck.
Course: SE.
Direction of wind:
NE.
10th day:
22 July.
Passed Gibraltar - Panic on board - Three men dead already - mate out of his mind - Rats in the hold - I fear the plague...
"The plague is upon us!
Go home!
Shut all your windows and doors! "
All citizens are notified that the honourable magistrate of this town prohibits the moving of plague- victims into hospitals to prevent the plague from spreading through the streets.
Hutter had made Ellen promise not to touch the book which had given him such terrifying hallucinations.
Yet she way unable to withstand its strange fascination.
The Book of the Vampires
One can recognize that mark of the vampire by the trace of his fangs on the victim' s throat.
Every night, in front of me... "
Panic seized the people.
Who was sick or dying?
Who would be stricken tomorrow?
"I shall run over there quickly.
I shall get Sievers... "
Wherefore there is no salvation therefrom except that a woman pure in heart were to make the vampire forget the cock' s first crowing.
Of her own free will would she have to give him her blood.
The panic- stricken town was looking for a scape- goat.
It chose Knock.
"They saw him escape - he strangled his keeper!"
"He strangled him!
The vampire! "
"Bulwer!
Fetch Bulwer! "
"Master!
Master!
Beware! "
"The master... is... dead."
"Thomas!"
And the miracle shall be told in truth.
At that very hour the Great Death ceased and the shadow of the empire vanished as if overcome by the victorious rays of the living sun.
The End
Hi.
I' ve got an appointment with Mr. Ullman.
My name is Jack Torrance.
His office is the first door on the left.
Thank you.
Mr. Ullman?
I' m Jack Torrance.
Come on in, Jack.
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
This is my secretary, Susie.
- Susie, how do you do?
- Any trouble finding us?
No problem at all.
I made the trip in 3 1 / 2 hours.
That' s very good time.
Sit down a minute, Jack.
Just make yourself at home.
Like some coffee?
lf you' re having some, I wouldn' t mind.
Thanks.
- Susie.
- Sure.
And ask Bill Watson to join us.
Yes, I will.
Mom?
Yeah?
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Sure I do.
It' il be lots of fun.
Yeah.
I guess so.
Anyway, there' s hardly anybody to play with around here.
I know.
It always takes a little time to make new friends.
Yeah, I guess so.
What about Tony?
He' s looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
No, I aín 't, Mrs. Torrance.
Now, come on, Tony.
Don' t be silly.
I don 't want to go there.
How come you don' t want to go?
I just don 't.
Let' s just wait and see.
We' re all going to have a real good time.
Bill, I' d like you to meet Jack Torrance.
How do you do, Bill?
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.
Join in.
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
I' d like you to take him around soon as we' re through.
Fine.
Jack is a schoolteacher.
Formerly a schoolteacher.
What line of work are you in now?
I' m a writer.
Teaching' s been more or less a way of making ends meet.
This ought to be quite a change for you.
I' m looking for a change.
Our people in Denver recommended Jack very highly, and for once...... l agree with them.
Let' s see, where were we?
I was about to explain...... that our season here runs from May 1 5th to October 30th.
Then we close down completely until the following May.
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?
It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
It would be.
The problem is the enormous cost...... it would be to keep the road to Sidewinder open.
It' s a 25- mile stretch of road.
It gets 20 feet of snow during the winter.
There' s just no way to make it economically feasible...... to keep it clear.
When the place was built in 1 907...... there was very little interest in winter sports.
This site was chosen for its seclusion and scenic beauty.
It' s certainly got plenty of that.
That' s right.
Did they give you any idea in Denver...... about what the job entails?
Only in a very general way.
The winters can be fantastically cruel.
The basic idea is to cope with the very costly damage...... and depreciation which can occur.
This consists mainly of running the boiler...... heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis...... repairing damage as it occurs...... and doing repairs so the elements can' t get a foothold.
That sounds fine to me.
Physically, it' s not a very demanding job.
The only thing that can get a bit trying here during the winter...... is a tremendous sense of isolation.
That just happens to be exactly what I' m looking for.
I' m outlining a new writing project.
Five months of peace is just what I want.
That' s very good, Jack.
Because, for some people...... solitude...... and isolation...... can, of itself, become a problem.
Not for me.
How about your wife and son?
Do you think they' il take to it?
They' il love it.
Great.
Before I turn you over to Bill...... there' s one other thing I think we should talk about.
Not to sound melodramatic...... but it' s been known to give a few people...... second thoughts about the job.
I' m intrigued.
I don' t suppose they said anything in Denver...... about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1 970.
I don' t believe they did.
My predecessor in this job...... hired a man named Charles Grady as the winter caretaker.
He came up with his wife and 2 little girls of about 8 and 1 0.
He had a good employment record, good references.
And from what I' ve been told, he seemed...... like a completely normal individual.
But at some point during the winter...... he must have suffered some kind of a complete mental breakdown.
He ran amuck...
... and killed his family with an ax.
Stacked them neatly in a room in the west wing, and then...... he put both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth.
The police thought...... that it was what the old- timers used to call cabin fever.
A kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur...... when people are shut in together over long periods of time.
That is...... quite a story.
Yeah, it is.
It' s still hard for me to believe it actually happened here.
But it did.
I think you can appreciate why I wanted to tell you about it.
I certainly can.
I also understand why your people in Denver...... left it for you to tell me.
Obviously, some people can be put off...... from staying in a place where something like that happened.
You can rest assured that' s not going to happen with me.
And as far as my wife is concerned...... l' m sure she' il be absolutely fascinated when I tell her.
She' s a confirmed ghost story...... and horror film addict.
Tony, do you think Dad' il get the job?
He already díd.
He' s goíng to phone Wendy up ín a few mínutes to tell her.
- Hi, babe.
How' s ít goíng?
Great.
I' m at the hotel and I still have a lot to do.
I don' t think I can get home before 9 or 1 0.
Sounds like you got the job.
Right.
It' s a beautiful place.
You and Danny are going to love it.
Tony, why don' t you want to go to the hotel?
I don 't know.
You do too know.
Now come on, tell me.
I don 't want to.
Please.
No.
Now, Tony, tell me.
Now, hold your eyes still so I can see.
That' s good.
Now the other one.
Good boy.
Now, Danny...... when you were brushing your teeth...... do you remember if you smelled anything funny...... or saw any bright, flashing lights or anything at all strange?
No.
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Yes.
What' s the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
My mom was saying, "Wake up.
Wake up, Danny, wake up. "
Can you remember what you were doing...... just before you started brushing your teeth?
Talking to Tony.
Is Tony one of your animals?
No.
He' s a little boy that lives in my mouth.
Tony' s his imaginary friend.
If you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Why not?
Because he hides.
Where does he go?
To my stomach.
Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
I don' t want to talk about Tony anymore.
That' s fine.
All right, Danny.
I' m going to ask you to do me a favor...... and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.
Do I have to?
Yes.
I' d like you to.
We' re going in the other room for a few minutes and talk.
I' il come back and check on you.
- Shall we go into the living room?
- Yes.
- Please.
- Thank you.
Mrs. Torrance, I don' t think you have anything to worry about.
I' m quite sure there' s nothing physically wrong with Danny.
He seems absolutely fine now.
But you should' ve seen him.
I know.
IKids can scare you to death.
But believe me, these episodes are not at all uncommon.
And they look much worse than they are.
But what was the matter with him?
Most of the time, these episodes with kids are never explained.
They' re brought on by emotional factors and rarely occur again.
They' re more akin to autohypnosis...... a kind of self- induced trance.
If it reoccurs, which I doubt...... we can always think about having some tests done.
I' m sure you' re right.
Have you been in Boulder long?
Only about three months.
We' re from Vermont.
My husband was teaching school there.
Did the appearance of Danny' s imaginary friend....
Tony.
Did Tony' s first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
Let' s see....
I guess Danny started talking to Tony...... about the time we put him in nursery school.
Did he adjust well to school?
He didn' t like it too much at first.
I guess that' s about when I first noticed he was talking to Tony.
What sort of injury did he have?
He dislocated his shoulder.
How did he manage to do that?
Purely an accident.
My husband had been drinking...... and he came home about three hours late.
So he wasn' t exactly in the greatest mood that night.
And Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room...... and my husband grabbed his arm to pull him away from them.
It' s just the sort of thing you do 1 00 times with a child...... you know, in a park or in the street.
But on this particular occasion...... my husband just used too much strength...... and he injured Danny' s arm.
Anyway, something good did come out of it all because he said...... "Wendy, I' m never going to touch another drop.
And if I do, you can leave me. "
And he didn' t.
He hasn' t had any alcohol in 5 months.
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.
Dad?
I' m hungry.
You should' ve eaten your breakfast.
We' il get you something as soon as we get to the hotel.
Okay, Mom.
Wasn' t it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
I think that was farther west, in the Sierras.
What was the Donner party?
They were a party of settlers in covered wagon times.
They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.
They had to resort to cannibalism in order to stay alive.
You mean they ate each other up?
They had to, in order to survive.
Jack.
Don' t worry, Mom.
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.
See, it' s okay.
He saw it on the television.
- What time does the plane leave?
- 8: 30.
That gives us plenty of time to go over everything.
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Bye.
Good morning.
I hope you haven' t been waiting too long.
No problem.
We had time to grab a bite to eat.
Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.
ls your family having a look around?
No, my son' s discovered the games room.
- Has your luggage been brought in?
- Right there.
ln view of all we have to cover today...... l suggest we have a quick look at your apartment and get started.
Have the Torrances' things brought to their apartment.
I' d better collect my family first.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
It' s beautiful.
My God!
This place is fantastic, isn' t it, hon?
It sure is.
I' ve never seen anything like this before.
Are all these lndian designs authentic?
I believe they' re based...... mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
They' re really gorgeous.
As a matter of fact...... this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I' ve ever seen.
This old place has had an illustrious past.
In its heyday, it was a stopping place for the jet setters...... even before anybody knew what a jet set was.
We had four presidents who stayed here.
Lots of movie stars.
Royalty?
All the best people.
This is the staff wing of the hotel.
None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
- Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
- Goodbye, girls.
And here are your quarters.
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.
And a small bedroom for your son.
Perfect for a child.
Well, then.
Place is very nicely self- contained.
Easy to keep.
Cozy.
Yes, very cozy for a family.
If you feel like spreading out...... you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
Well, it' s very...... homey.
This is our famous hedge maze.
It' s quite an attraction here.
The walls are 1 3 feet high...... and the hedge is as old as the hotel itself.
A lot of fun, but I wouldn' t want to go in there...... unless I had an hour to spare to find my way out.
When was the Overlook built?
Construction started in 1 907.
It was finished in 1 909.
The site' s supposed to be on an lndian burial ground.
They actually had to repel...... a few lndian attacks as they were building it.
That' s our Snowcat.
Can you both drive a car?
That' s fine.
Basically the Snowcat operates very much like a car.
It won' t take you long to get the hang of it.
As a matter of fact, we brought a decorator in from Chicago...... just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
He sure did a beautiful job.
Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
This is our Gold Ballroom.
I' il say!
We can accommodate up to 300 people here very comfortably.
Boy, we could really have a good party in this room.
I' m afraid you won' t do too well here unless you brought supplies.
We remove the booze from the premises when we shut down.
That reduces the insurance we normally have to carry.
We don' t drink.
Then you' re in luck.
Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
This is Dick Hallorann, our head chef.
Mr. Hallorann, I' m Jack.
This is my wife, Winifred.
Glad to meet you.
The Torrances will take care of the Overlook this winter.
That' s just great.
How do you folks like our hotel so far?
It' s just wonderful.
Hi, Danny!
I found him outside looking for you.
Did you get tired of bombing the universe?
Come on over here.
Thank you, Susie.
I think it' d be good if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen...... while I continue on with Jack.
It would be a pleasure.
Right this way.
See you later, hon.
Bye, darling.
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.
Now, are you a "Winnie," or a "Freddie"?
I' m a Wendy.
Wendy.
That' s nice.
That' s the prettiest.
This is the kitchen, huh?
This is it.
How do you like it, Danny?
ls it big enough for you?
It' s the biggest place I ever seen.
This whole place is such an enormous maze.
I' il have to leave a trail of breadcrumbs every time I come in.
Don' t let it get you down.
It' s big, but it ain' t nothing but a kitchen.
A lot of this stuff you' il never have to touch.
I wouldn' t know what to do with it if I did.
One thing for sure, you don' t have to worry about food.
You folks could eat here for a year and never have the same menu twice.
Right here is our walk- in freezer.
This is where we keep all of our meat.
You got 1 5 rib roasts...... 30 ten- pound bags of hamburger.
We got 1 2 turkeys, about 40 chickens...... 50 sirloin steaks, two dozen of pork roast...... and 20 legs of lamb.
Do you like lamb, Doc?
You don' t?
What' s your favorite food, then?
French fries and ketchup.
I think we can manage that too, Doc.
Come along, now.
Watch your step.
How' d you know we call him Doc?
- Beg your pardon?
You called Danny "Doc" twice.
I did?
We call him Doc sometimes, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.
But how did you know?
I guess I probably heard you call him that.
It' s possible.
But I honestly don' t remember...... calling him that since we' ve been with you.
Anyway, he looks like a Doc, doesn' t he?
What' s up, Doc?
Now, this is the storeroom.
In here is where we keep...... all the dried goods and the canned goods.
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes, Sugar Puffs...... Rice IKrispies, oatmeal, Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.
You got a dozen jugs of black molasses.
We got 60 boxes of dried milk...
How' d you like some ice cream, Doc?
Sociables, finger rolls...... and 7 kinds of what have you.
Now, we' ve got dried peaches, dried apricots...... dried raisins and dried prunes.
You know, you got to keep regular if you want to be happy.
- How' re you getting on?
- Fine.
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We' re on our way to the basement.
I promise we won' t keep her very long.
No problem, Mr. Ullman.
I was just getting to the ice cream.
You like ice cream, Doc?
I thought you did.
You folks mind if I give Danny some ice cream while we wait?
- Not at all.
- We don' t mind.
- Good.
- Sound good to you, Doc?
Okay, you behave yourself.
What kind of ice cream do you like?
Chocolate.
Chocolate it shall be.
Come on, son.
It' s amazing, all this activity today.
The guests and some staff left yesterday, but the...... last day' s always hectic.
Everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
By 5: 00 tonight, you' il never know anybody was ever here.
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
Do you know how I knew your name was Doc?
You know what I' m talking about, don' t you?
I can remember when I was a little boy...... my grandmother and I could hold conversations...... entirely without ever opening our mouths.
She called it "shining."
And for a long time I thought it was just the two of us...... that had "the shine" to us.
Just like you probably thought you was the only one.
But there are other folks...... though mostly they don' t know it, or don' t believe it.
How long have you been able to do it?
Why don' t you want to talk about it?
I' m not supposed to.
Who says you ain' t supposed to?
Tony.
Who' s Tony?
Tony' s the little boy that lives in my mouth.
Is Tony the one that...... tells you things?
How does he tell you things?
It' s like I go to sleep, and he shows me things.
But when I wake up, I can' t remember everything.
Does your mom and dad know about Tony?
Do they know he tells you things?
Has Tony ever told you anything about this place?
About the Overlook Hotel?
Now think real hard, Doc.
Think.
Maybe he showed me something.
Try to think of what it was.
Mr. Hallorann, are you scared of this place?
Scared of nothing here.
Some shine...... and some don' t.
I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel...... has something about it that' s like shining.
Is there something bad here?
You know, Doc, when something happens...... it can leave a trace of itself behind.
Say, like...... if someone burns toast.
Maybe things that happen leave other kind of traces behind.
But things that people who shine can see.
Just like they can see things that haven' t happened yet...... sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago.
I think a lot of things happened right here...... in this particular hotel over the years.
And not all of them was good.
What about room 237?
Room 237?
You' re scared of room 237, ain' t you?
No, I ain' t.
Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?
Nothing.
There ain' t nothing in room 237.
But you ain' t got no business going in there anyway.
So stay out.
You understand?
Stay out!
Good morning, hon.
Your breakfast is ready.
What time is it?
It' s about 1 1: 30.
Jesus.
I guess we' ve been staying up too late.
I know it.
I made them just the way you like them, sunny- side up.
Nice.
It' s really pretty outside.
How about taking me for a walk after you finish your breakfast?
I suppose I ought to try to do some writing first.
Any ideas yet?
Lots of ideas.
No good ones.
Something will come.
It' s just a matter of settling into the habit of writing every day.
That' s all it is.
It' s really nice up here, isn' t it?
I love it.
I really do.
I' ve never been this happy or comfortable anywhere.
It' s amazing how fast you get used to such a big place.
I tell you, when we first came up here...... l thought it was kind of scary.
I fell in love with it right away.
When I came up here for my interview...... it was as though I' d been here before.
I mean, we all have moments of deja vu...... but this was ridiculous.
It was almost as though I knew...... what was going to be around every corner.
How' s that?
- All right.
- And you' re going to lose.
You' d better run fast!
Look out!
I' m coming in close.
Loser has to keep America clean.
IKeep America clean.
Danny, you win.
Let' s take the rest of this walking.
Give me your hand.
Isn' t it beautiful?
Dead end.
We made it.
Isn' t it beautiful?
It' s so pretty.
I didn' t think it was going to be this big.
Did you?
Rutherford was serving a life sentence...... for a 1968 shooting.
And the search continues for that missing Aspen woman.
24- year- old Susan Robertson has been missing 10 days.
She disappeared on a hunting trip with her husband.
They may have to call off the search...... if a predicted snowstorm moves in tomorrow.
It' s so beautiful in Denver today...... it' s hard to believe a snowstorm could be close.
I want to go outside and lie in the sun...... yet to our north, to our west, it is snowing and cold.
And it' s moving...... right here towards Colorado as we talk.
Hi, hon.
How' s it going?
Fine.
Get a lot written today?
The weather forecast said it' s going to snow tonight.
What do you want me to do about it?
Come on, hon.
Don' t be so grouchy.
I' m not...... being grouchy.
I just want to finish my work.
I understand.
I' il come back later with a couple of sandwiches.
Maybe you' il let me read something then.
Wendy...... let me explain something to you.
When you come in and interrupt, you' re breaking my concentration.
You' re distracting me...... and it will then take me time to get back to where I was.
Understand?
Fine.
We' re going to make a new rule:
Whenever I' m in here...... and you hear me typing...... or whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here...... when I' m in here, that means I am working.
That means don' t come in.
Now, do you think you can handle that?
Fine.
Why don' t you start right now and get the fuck out of here?
All right, you!
I know you' ve got more.
Missed!
Don' t have!
No fair anymore.
I knew it.
This is IKDlK 1 2 calling IKDlK 1.
KDK 12 to KDK 1.
This is IKDlK 1.
We' re receiving you.
Hi, this is Wendy Torrance at the Overlook Hotel.
Hi, how are you folks getting on up there?
We' re just fine.
But our telephones aren' t doing too well.
Are the lines down, by any chance?
Yes, quite a few of them are down due to the storm.
Over.
Well, I wouldn' t like to say.
Over.
Boy, this storm is really something, isn' t it?
It' s one of the worst we' ve had for years.
Is there anything else we can do for you, Mrs. Torrance?
I suppose not.
Over.
If you folks have any problems up there, just give us a call.
And, Mrs. Torrance?
It might be a good idea if you leave your radio on all the time.
We' il do that.
It was real nice talking to you.
Bye.
Over and out.
Hello, Danny.
Come and play with us.
Come and play with us, Danny.
Forever...... and ever...... and ever.
Tony...... l' m scared.
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.
It' sjust like pictures in a book, Danny.
It isn' t real.
Please let me give you some money.
I wouldn' t think of it.
Well, how can I repay you?
It' s okay.
Really.
Well, I' m going to have some coffee.
Would you like some?
Sure.
Great.
Sit down.
Marvelous doughnuts.
Help yourself.
Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
Can I go up to my room and get my fire engine?
Not right now.
Daddy' s asleep.
I won' t make any noise.
Now come on, Doc.
He only went to bed a few hours ago.
Can' t you wait till later?
I promise I' il tiptoe.
All right.
But really don' t make a sound.
I won' t, Mom.
Make sure you come right back...... because I' m going to make lunch soon.
Okay, Mom.
Can I go to my room and get my fire engine?
Come here for a minute first.
How' s it going, Doc?
Having a good time?
Yes, Dad.
Good.
I want you to have a good time.
I am, Dad.
Do you feel bad?
I' m just a little bit tired.
Then why don' t you go to sleep?
I can' t.
I got too much to do.
Do you like this hotel?
I do.
I love it.
Don' t you?
I guess so.
Good.
I want you to like it here.
I wish we could stay here forever...... and ever...... and ever.
What?
You would never hurt Mommy or me, would you?
What do you mean?
Did your mother ever say that to you?
That I would hurt you?
No, Dad.
You sure?
Yes, Dad.
I love you, Danny.
I love you more than anything else...... in the whole world...... and I would never do anything to hurt you...... never.
You know that, don' t you?
Yes, Dad.
Good.
Mom, are you in there?
What happened?
Honey...... what' s wrong?
I had the most...... terrible nightmare I ever had.
- It was the most horrible dream.
- It' s okay, it' s okay now.
Really.
I dreamed that I...... that I killed you and Danny.
I cut you up into little pieces.
My God.
I must be losing my mind.
Everything' s going to be all right.
Let' s get up off the floor.
There.
Now sit up.
It' s okay.
It' s okay.
Danny!
Everything' s okay!
Just go play in your room for a while.
Your dad' s just got a headache.
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.
Honey, let me just go get him out of here.
I' il be right back.
Why don' t you mind me?
Oh, my God.
What happened to your neck?
What happened to your neck?
You did this to him...... didn' t you?!
You son of a bitch!
You did this to him!
Didn' t you?!
How could you?!
How could you?!
God!
I' d give anything for a drink.
I' d give my goddamn soul...... for just a glass of beer.
Hi, Lloyd.
A little slow tonight, isn' t it?
Yes it is, Mr. Torrance.
What will it be?
I' m awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd...... because I just happen to have two twenties...... and two tens right here in my wallet.
I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.
So here' s what:
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...... a little glass and some ice.
You can do that, can' t you, Lloyd?
You' re not too busy, are you?
No, sir.
I' m not busy at all.
Good man.
You set them up...... and I' il knock them back, one by one.
White man' s burden, Lloyd, my man.
White man' s burden.
Say, Lloyd...... it seems I' m temporarily light.
How' s my credit in this joint, anyway?
Your credit' s fine, Mr. Torrance.
That' s swell.
I like you, Lloyd.
I always liked you.
You were always the best of them.
Best goddamned bartender...... from Timbuktu to Portland, Maine.
Or Portland, Oregon, for that matter.
Thank you for saying so.
Here' s to 5 miserable months on the wagon...... and all the irreparable harm that it' s caused me.
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
Things could be better.
Things could be a whole lot better.
I hope it' s nothing serious.
Nothing serious.
Just a little problem with...... the old sperm bank upstairs.
Nothing I can' t handle, though.
Thanks.
Women.
Can' t live with them...... can' t live without them.
Words of wisdom, Lloyd.
Words of...... wisdom.
I never laid a hand on him, goddamn it.
I didn' t.
I wouldn' t touch one hair on his goddamn little head.
I love the little son of a bitch.
I' d do anything for him.
Any fucking thing for him.
But that bitch!
As long as I live...... she' il never let me forget what happened.
I did hurt him once, okay?
It was an accident.
Completely unintentional.
It could have happened to anybody.
And it was three goddamn years ago!
The little fucker had thrown all my papers all over the floor.
All I tried to do was pull him up.
A momentary loss of muscular coordination.
I mean...... a few extra foot- pounds of energy...... per second, per second.
Thank God you' re here.
There' s someone else in the hotel with us.
There' s a crazy woman in one of the rooms.
She tried to strangle Danny.
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Really.
I swear it.
Danny told me.
He went up into one of the bedrooms.
The door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bathtub.
She tried to strangle him!
Which room was it?
From Channel 10 in Miami...... this is Newswatch with Glen Rinker...... Ann Bishop, and the award- winning Newswatch team.
Good evening.
I' m Glen Rinker, Newswatch Ten.
As Miami continues to swelter in a record winter heat wave...... bringing temperatures to the 90s...... Central and Mountain states are buried in snow.
In Colorado, 10 inches of snow fell injust a few hours tonight.
Travel in the Rockies is almost impossible.
Airports are shut down, stranding thousands ofpassengers.
Highways are blocked by snowdrifts.
Railroad tracks are frozen.
Officials in Colorado tell Newswatch...... at least 3 have been killed by exposure to freezing winds.
The governor of Colorado is expected...... to declare a weather emergency.
The National Guard might be called out...... to clear streets and roads.
Weather forecasters predict more snow...... and heavy winds tonight and tomorrow...... with temperatures dropping well below zero.
Back here in Florida, we' ve got the opposite problem.
The heat and humidity are supposed to climb.
Local beaches should bejammed.
Our weather expert, Walter Cronice...... will have the local forecast later on Newswatch.
We' re sorry.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
If you need assistance, please call the operator.
Yes, it' s me.
Thank God.
Did you find anything?
No.
Nothing at all.
I didn' t see one goddamn thing.
To 237?
Yes, I did.
And you didn' t see anything at all?
Absolutely nothing.
How is he?
He' s still asleep.
Good.
I' m sure he' il be himself again in the morning.
Are you sure it was the right room?
I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake.
He must have gone in that room.
The door was open, the lights were on.
I just don' t understand it.
What about those bruises on his neck?
Somebody did that to him.
I think...... he did it to himself.
No.
That' s not possible.
Once you rule out his version of what happened...... there is no other explanation.
Is there?
It wouldn' t be that different from the episode...... that he had before we came up here.
Would it?
Whatever the explanation is...
... l think we...... have to get Danny out of here.
Get him out of here?
You mean...... just leave the hotel?
It is so...... typical of you to create a problem like this...... when I finally have a chance to accomplish something!
When I' m really into my work!
I could really write my own ticket if I went back now, couldn' t l?
Shoveling out driveways, work in a car wash.
Any of that appeal to you?
I have let you fuck up my life so far...... but I am not going to let you fuck this up.
Good evening.
Forest Service.
My name is Dick Hallorann.
I' m the head chef at the Overlook Hotel.
Good evening.
What can I do for you?
I' ve been trying to make an urgent phone call up there...... but the operator said that the phone lines are down.
A lot of lines around here are down due to the storm.
I hate to put you through any trouble...... but there' s a family up there all by themselves with a young kid.
And with this storm and everything...... l' d appreciate it if you' d give them a call on your radio...... just to see if everything' s okay.
I' il be glad to do that.
Why don' t you call me back in about 20 minutes?
Thank you very much.
I' il do that.
All right, sir.
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.
Good evening.
Hi, Lloyd.
Been away, but now I' m back.
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.
It' s good to see you.
It' s good to be back, Lloyd.
What' il it be, sir?
Hair of the dog that bit me.
Bourbon on the rocks.
That' il do her.
No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.
No charge?
Your money' s no good here.
Orders from the house.
Orders from the house.
Drink up, Mr. Torrance.
I' m the kind of man likes to know who' s buying their drinks, Lloyd.
It' s not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance.
At least, not at this point.
Anything you say, Lloyd.
Anything you say.
Oh, dear!
I' m so sorry, sir.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
I' ve made an awful mess of your jacket, sir.
I' ve got plenty of jackets.
I' m afraid it' s advocaat, sir.
It tends to stain.
Advocaat, is it?
Yes, sir.
I think the best thing...... is to come along to the gentlemen' s room...... and we' il get some water to it, sir.
Looks like you might have got a spot of it on yourself...... Jeevesy old boy.
That doesn' t matter, sir.
You' re the important one.
Awfully nice of you to say.
Of course, I intended to change my jacket this evening...... before the fish and goose soiree.
Very wise, sir.
Very wise.
I' il just...... hold this for you there, Jeevesy.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Let' s see if we can improve this with a little water, sir.
All right.
I' il just...... set my bourbon and advocaat down right there.
Won' t keep you a moment.
Fine.
What do they call you, Jeevesy?
Grady, sir.
Delbert Grady.
Grady?
Yes, sir.
Delbert Grady.
That' s right, sir.
Mr. Grady...... haven' t I seen you somewhere before?
Why, no, sir.
I don' t believe so.
It' s coming off now, sir.
Mr. Grady...... weren' t you once the caretaker here?
Why, no, sir.
I don' t believe so.
You a married man, are you, Mr. Grady?
Yes, sir.
I have a wife and two daughters, sir.
And...... where are they now?
They' re somewhere around.
I' m not quite sure at the moment.
You were the caretaker here.
I recognize you.
I saw your picture in the newspapers.
You...... chopped your wife and daughter up into little bits.
And...... then you blew your brains out.
That' s strange, sir.
I don' t have any recollection of that at all.
Mr. Grady...... you were the caretaker here.
I' m sorry to differ with you, sir.
But you...... are the caretaker.
You' ve always been the caretaker.
I should know, sir.
I' ve always been here.
Did you know, Mr. Torrance...... that your son...... is attempting to bring an outside party...... into this situation?
Did you know that?
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Who?
A nigger.
A nigger?
A nigger...... cook.
How?
Your son...... has a very great talent.
I don' t think you are aware how great it is.
But he is attempting to use that very talent...... against your will.
Well...... he is a very willful boy.
Indeed he is, Mr. Torrance.
A very willful boy.
A rather...... naughty boy...... if I may be so bold, sir.
It' s his mother.
She...... interferes.
Perhaps they need a good...... talking- to.
If...... you don' t mind my saying so.
Perhaps...... a bit more.
My girls, sir...... they didn' t care for the Overlook at first.
One of them actually stole a pack of matches...... and tried to burn it down.
But I...... corrected them, sir.
And when my wife tried to prevent me from doing my duty...... l...... corrected her.
We have the Snowcat.
If the weather breaks...... we might just be able...... to get down the mountain.
I could call the forest rangers first...... and...... tell them that we' re coming....... so that...... they could start searching for us in case we didn' t make it.
And if Jack won' t come with us...... l' il just have to tell him that we' re going by ourselves.
That' s all there is to it.
Redrum.
Redrum.
What' s the matter, hon?
Redrum!
Are you having a bad dream?
Hon?
Danny' s not here, Mrs. Torrance.
Come on, hon.
Wake up.
You just had a bad dream.
Everything' s okay.
Danny can' t wake up, Mrs. Torrance.
Wake up!
Come on.
Right now.
Wake up!
Danny' s gone away, Mrs. Torrance.

Forest service.
This is Dick Hallorann again.
I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
We tried to contact them several times but they didn' t answer.
Maybe they got their radio turned off or they can' t hear it.
If you' d like, I' d be glad to try again later on.
That' s very nice of you.
I' il call you back later.
Bye.
What time will we get to Denver?
We' re due to arrive at 8: 20, sir.
Thank you very much.
Durkin' s Garage.
Can I speak to Larry?
Speaking.
Hi, Larry.
This is Dick.
Dick Hallorann.
Dick!
How you doing?
How' s the weather down there?
I' m not in Florida.
I' m calling from Stapleton Airport.
What are you doing there?
I just got in from Miami.
I got to get to the Overlook today.
What' s the weather like there?
The snowplows are keeping things moving in town...... but the mountain roads are blocked.
Then I' m going to need a Snowcat to get up there.
Can you fix me up with one?
What' s the big deal about getting there today...... especially in this weather?
Larry, just between you and me, we got a very serious problem...... with the people taking care of the place.
They turned out to be completely unreliable assholes.
Ullman phoned me last night.
And I' m supposed to find out if they have to be replaced.
How long will it take you to get here?
About five hours.
I' m going to rent a car here at the airport.
Okay, I' il take care of it.
Thanks, Larry.
I really appreciate that.
That' s all right.
Drive carefully.
You' re with Hal and Charlie on Radio 63, KHOW, Denver.
And we have a bad day out there.
Heavy snow throughout the Denver metro area.
Wolf Creek and Red Mountain passes are closed...... and the chain law is in effect at the Eisenhower Tunnel.
We hear from the news department...... only a few flights are landing at Stapleton Airport...... and with storms like this...... l guess the entire airport will be closed within the hour.
The storm will continue through the day and the Weather Service...... has declared a stockman' s and traveler' s advisory...... for all areas outlying the Denver metro region.
Get the cows in the barn.
Hon?
Listen to me for a minute, will you?
I' m just going to go and talk to Daddy for a few minutes...... and I' il be right back.
I want you to just stay here...... and watch your cartoons, okay?
Okay, hon?
Yes, Mrs. Torrance.
All right.
I' il be back in just about five minutes.
I' m going to lock the door behind me.
How do you like it?
How do you like it?
What are you doing down here?
I just...... wanted...... to talk to you.
Okay.
Let' s talk.
What do you want to talk about?
I can' t really remember.
You can' t remember.
No...... l can' t.
Maybe it was about Danny?
Maybe it was about him.
I think we should discuss Danny.
I think...... we should discuss what should be done with him.
What should be done with him?
I don' t know.
I don' t think that' s true.
I think you have some very definite ideas...... about what should be done with Danny.
And I' d like to know what they are.
Well, I...... l think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
You think "maybe" he should be taken to a doctor?
When do you think "maybe" he should be taken to a doctor?
As soon as possible?
"As soon as possible?"
Please.
You believe his health might be at stake.
Yes.
And you are concerned about him.
And are you concerned about me?
Of course I am.
Of course you are!
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
What are you talking about?
Have you ever had a single moment' s...... thought about my responsibilities?
Have you ever thought for a single moment...... about my responsibilities to my employers?!
Has is ever occurred to you...... that I have agreed to look after the hotel until May 1 st?
Does it matter to you at all...... that the owners have placed their complete confidence in me...... and that I have signed a letter of agreement...... in which I' ve accepted that responsibility?
Do you have the slightest idea...... what a moral and ethical principal is?
Do you?!
Has it ever occurred to you what would happen to my future...... if I fail to live up to my responsibilities?
Has it ever occurred to you?
Has it?!
Stay away from me!
Why?
I just want to go back to my room.
Why?
Well...... l' m very confused.
And I just need a chance to think things over.
You' ve had your whole fucking life to think things over!
What good' s a few minutes more going to do you now?
Stay away from me!
Please!
Don' t hurt me.
I' m not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me!
Stay away!
Light of my life.
I' m not going to hurt you.
You didn' t let me finish my sentence.
I said, "I' m not going to hurt you."
I' m just going to bash your brains in.
I' m going to bash them right the fuck in.
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!
I' m not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me!
Stay away!
Please!
Stop swinging the bat.
Stay away from me.
Put that bat down, Wendy.
Stop it!
Give me the bat.
Please!
- Stay away!
- Give me the bat.
Stop it!
Give me the bat.
- Stay away from me.
- Stop swinging the bat.
Please stop!
Give me the bat.
Stay away from me.
- Stop it!
- Give me the bat.
Goddamn --!
What are you doing?
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Wait a minute!
What are you doing?
Open the door!
Goddamn it!
Let me out of here!
Open the goddamn door!
Wendy, listen.
Let me out and I' il forget the whole goddamn thing.
It' il be just like nothing ever happened.
I think you hurt my head real bad.
I' m dizzy.
I need a doctor.
Honey.
Don' t leave me in here.
I' m going to go now.
I' m going to try...... to get Danny down the Sidewinder...... in the Snowcat today.
I' il bring back a doctor.
I' m going to go now.
You' ve got a big surprise coming to you.
You' re not going anywhere.
Go check out the Snowcat and the radio, and you' il see what I mean.
Go check it out.
Go check it out!
Go check it out.
It' s Grady, Mr. Torrance.
Delbert Grady.
Grady?
Hello, Grady.
Mr. Torrance...... l see you can hardly have taken care of the...... business we discussed.
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady.
I' il deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance?
I wonder.
I have my doubts.
I, and others, have come to believe...... that your heart is not in this.
That you haven' t the belly for it.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.
That' s all I ask.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance.
Somewhat more...... resourceful.
She seems to have got the better of you.
For the moment, Mr. Grady.
Only for the moment.
I fear you will have to deal with this matter...... in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.
I fear...... that is the only thing to do.
There' s nothing I look forward to...... with greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
You give your word on that, do you, Mr. Torrance?
I give you my word.
Redrum.
Redrum.
Danny, stop it!
I' m home.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
I can' t get out.
Run!
Run and hide!
Run!
Quick!
Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in.
Not by the hair on your chinny- chin- chin?
Then I' il huff...... and I' il puff...... and I' il blow your house in!
Please!
Don' t!
Don' t!
Stop it!
Here' s Johnny!
Hello?
Anybody here?
Hello?
Anybody here?
Anybody here?
Danny- boy!
I' m coming!
I' m coming, Dan!
Great party, isn' t it?
I' m coming!!
You can' t get away!
I' m right behind you!
- Mommy!
- Danny, come here!
Mommy.
Where...?
Ju- on:
The curse of one who dies in the grip of powerful rage.

Social Welfare Center
I' m back.
Hello.
Write your name and the time in here, please.
All right.
There.
Thanks.
Rika!
It' s this.
What?
By myself?
There' s no one else around.
But...
Whose case is it?
I can' t reach him.
He took the key and left, and hasn' t come back.
I' m just a volunteer...
That' s all right.
You' re used to this.
Mr Hirohashi...
Mr Goto' s looking for you.
Goto?
Would you do it?
Just look in on her.
But...
I' il buy you dinner.
You don' t have to...
Tokunaga
Hello?
Hello!
I' m from the Welfare Center...
May I come in?
Are you all right?!
You' re Sachie, right?
I' m here to help out in place of Mr Takahashi.
I' m Nishina Rika.
Come on...
Come here...
Sachie!
Who' s that boy upstairs?!
Sachie!
He was shut in a closet!
You didn' t say anything about a child.
Yes.
He' s still upstairs.
Yes.
I told you, they aren' t home yet!
Yes.
But...
Yes.
All right.
Yes.
There' s no one home right now.
Please leave a message.
Hello?
It' s Hitomi.
Hello?
Kazumi, are you there?
How' s Mom getting along?
I' m a bit worried, so please give me a call.
Um, what' s your name?
Toshio.
Yeah?
'Toshio'...
My name' s...
I told her.
Sachie?
I told her.
I told Kazumi.
I told her again and again.
I told her again and again.
What' s the matter?
Why don' t you lie down, OK?
Again and again, I told her.
Just the way you said to.
Please stop tormenting me.
Sachie...
Katsuya
Morning.
Mom sure sleeps late these days.
That' s' cause she' s up all night.
Every night.
I' m sure it' s fine for someone who can sleep through anything.
Maybe it was the move.
I' il talk to the helper.
We' re paying for him, after all.
That won' t help.
Your mother' s always nice with other people.
OK, OK.
Try to get along, will you?
You' il be home early?
Your sister' s coming!
You forgot!
Is it Friday already?
Get it together.
Hurry home.
OK.
See you.
Oh, Mother!
Just tell me if you want something!
Who' s that?
Who' s there?
I' m home!
Is Hitomi here?
Kazumi?
Mom?
Where' s Kazumi?
Mom?
Where is she?!
Kazumi!
Kazumi?
Are you here?
Kazumi?
Kazumi!
Hey!
Kazumi!
Kazumi!
Kazumi!
Hey!
Kazumi!
What' s wrong?
What happened?
What?
Hang on.
I' il call an ambulance.
What are you doing here?!
Kazumi!
Hello!
Hello?
I' m here!
Kazumi?
Kazumi?
Hi, Mom.
How are you?
Where' s Kazumi?
I' il start getting dinner ready.
Kazumi?
Is that you?
Katsuya?
Don' t scare me like that!
Where' s Kazumi?
Kazumi went out.
Something came up.
She' s not shopping?
She' il be back soon, won' t she?
I' m sorry, Hitomi.
This isn' t a very good time.
What' s going on?
Did something happen?
What?!
She deceived me!
That' s not my child.
That' s not my child.
What are you talking about?!
Look, just go away, OK?
Are you feeling all right?
I' m fine.
Just leave me alone for a while.
Hitomi
There' s no one home right now.
Please leave a message.
Hello?
It' s Hitomi.
Hello?
Kazumi, are you there?
How' s Mom getting along?
I' m a bit worried, so please give me a call.
Tokunaga Katsuya
Hello, Katsuya?
I just called your house.
Hello?
Katsuya?
Look, this isn' t funny!
I just hung up.
Who' s there?
The 5th- floor Ladies'?
Yes.
I' il go take a look.
You wait here.
Excuse me!
Yes?
Hello?
It' s me.
Katsuya?
I' m out front of your building.
What number were you?
702!
Hurry, will you?
Katsuya!
... also a house bat, a pygmy woodpecker...... wild birds not seen here before, a blue- green snake...... among 54 discoveries, including a 2. 5 - Meter discarded snakeskin...
Toyama
Hello?
Hello?
Missus?
Missus?
Rika?
Rika?
Rika!
Rika!
Mr Nakagawa...
Dial him.
Up there.
Rika...
Rika!
Are you OK?
Yeah.
Sorry, Mariko.
You' re missing school.
That' s OK.
I' ve got all the credits I need.
Anyway, what happened?
I don' t really understand that myself.
Was Hirohashi bugging you to do something again?
And you couldn' t say no?
You' re supposed to be the care- giver!
I' m glad you came.
I' il go buy a drink.
So that was the first time you' d been there?
Yes, it was.
About the child you say you saw there...
Did you find him?
No... not yet.
'Toshio'...
He said his name was Toshio.
Toshio?
Ms Nishina, the Tokunagas don' t have any children.
What?
What about that photograph?
There was a family picture in the house.
That wasn' t the Tokunagas.
Then who was it?
We' re looking into that.
Detective...
What happened there?
Excuse me.
The families before the Tokunagas all died or disappeared, too.
Is this all of them?
What about the sister?
We can' t find her.
A security guard where she works is dead, too.
And...... look at this.
A man named Saeki Takeo killed his wife Kayako there.
Later he was found dead on the road by a neighbor.
Saeki Kayako, 28, housewife.
She and Takeo had a son.
'Toshio'...
Kayako' s body was found...... up there under the roof.
Hi, Daddy!
Hi, lzumi.
Where' s Mom?
Shopping.
She' il be angry again if you don' t get home.
It' s OK.
Come over here.
Why?
Come on!
Quick!
What is it?
Look at this.
Yep!
This is the Prince of Heaven.
That' s the Princess.
And that' s their baby.
Yeah?
And who' s this?
Mr Toyama Yuji?
Lgarashi, Yahara Division.
What is it?
You were in charge of the Saeki investigation.
I' d like to talk to you.
Izumi, you get on home.
I quit the force.
Leave me alone, will you?
Two more people have died there.
You' re the only one left who was involved with the case.
Izumi!
What are you doing there?
Did you clean the bath?
It' s your turn today, you know.
Get going.
Was this the boy you saw at the Tokunaga house?
Yes.
Take a good look.
You' re sure?
Yes, it was him.
Did you find him?
No.
He went missing five years ago.
He' s never been found.
Even if he were alive somewhere, he' d be 11 years old.
Huh?
Mr Nakagawa...
This is Toyama Yuji.
He was on that case.
Thank you.
My name' s Nakagawa.
Come in.
Tokunaga Hitomi.
Her elder brother Katsuya lived in that house.
She went home, then disappeared.
Someone in her building saw her come home.
They found Hirohashi' s body.
The man who found Rika is dead.
Mr. Toyama.
Would you excuse me a minute, please?
Lzumi, you' re chicken!
What' s that?
Sake.
What' s that doing here?
Saori, you pig!
That' s not sake.
I' m leaving!
Wait!
It' s OK!
Are you running out?
Lzumi!
What a suck!
She' s always like that.
Yeah, and I heard...... now she hangs with Chiharu.
He hasn' t come home.
Where could he be?
Well?
She' s gone, you know.
Can you believe that!
Ayano, check out the window.
She' s there.
She' s by the gate.
It looks like she' s thinking.
Why' s she so scared?
Maybe she' s got ESP.
She didn' t have to leave!
I' m cold.
Yeah.
What was that?
What' s wrong?
Lzumi' s gone!
What?
Mr Toyama!
Mr Nakagawa!
Mr Toyama!
Please!
Get a grip!
What happened?!
Lzumi
What' s 1 st period?
English?
Mr Sekine!
Oh, yuck!
His English is weird!
Yeah!
It doesn' t sound like any English I' ve heard.
Do foreigners understand him?
He probably can' t speak it!
Yeah, but he' s teaching it to us!
Lzumi?
Lzumi?
What' s wrong?
Nothing.
Missing
Isn' t she lzumi?
She is not.
Find one?
Not yet.
'Bye.
Mr Sekine!
What' s up?
Toyama?
What' s wrong?
There' s no picture of lzumi.
Why not?
That shouldn' t be.
Did you look?
There isn' t.
We looked and looked and looked!
I see.
OK, I' il check the negatives.
Can you wait a while?
'Bye.
How long?!
Don' t pull!
You' il stretch my sweater!
Within a week.
Why a week?!
I' m a busy man!
A woman' s body has been found in an empty house in Nerima ward.
Nishina Rika, a 23 year- old social worker...... had been listed as missing.
No marks were found on the body.
Thank you.
Finally!
It' s not my fault!
We' re going to lzumi' s.
OK, I' il come with you.
Hey!
No, thanks.
'Bye.
We' il bring them back tomorrow.
Talk to Toyama for me!
Let me see!
No!
We' il see them with lzumi.
But I want to see them!
You' re lzumi' s friends?
Lzumi?
It' s Chiharu and Miyuki.
We brought the pictures.
Can we come in?
Isn' t it a bit dark in here?
Don' t!
Lzumi?
What' s wrong?
Lzumi?
The three of them are looking in...... at me.
'The three of them'?
Saori and the rest.
The night they disappeared, I was with them.
Then why didn' t...
I was scared!
Scared of what?
... there was a haunted house near here.
Haunted?
Where?
I forget!
How could you forget?
I wanted to!
Lzumi, will you tell us what' s going on?
Even before we went in...... I felt something strange.
Izumi, do you have ESP or something?
I don' t.
It' s not that.
You guys keep away.
Saori and the others treated it as a joke, but I couldn' t stay there.
I left, by myself.
I was scared.
I ran away.
They' re coming for me!
Lzumi, chill out!
Close the curtains!
Close them!
Close them!!
That' s what my husband was like before he died.
He had all the windows closed tight...
Does lzumi know about that?
I never told her anything about it.
The pictures...
What' s that?
Chiharu!
Who are you?
Dad?
I saw you at that house, you know.
Kayako
Hello?
Mariko!
It' s been ages!
Yeah.
What' s up?
Yeah.
Wow, that must have been hard.
Tomorrow?
Yeah, I' m OK.
Yeah, OK.
OK, see you.
I' m coming, Mr Saito.
I hear you' re going to be a great- grandfather!
Mr Saito?
Thank you.
Rika!
Mariko!
How have you been?
You' ve changed your hair.
I got it cut.
Are you free Sunday?
Sunday?
Sure.
Yeah?
He gave me two tickets...... and said to take you.
Really?
What?
In third year you liked Toyoshima, didn' t you.
Huh?
It was all over your face.
There' s already one problem kid... in my new class.
He hasn' t come to school once!
And his parents?
That' s the problem.
I can' t contact them.
Well, there must be some kind of reason...
At least they could return my calls.
I want to finish my home visits!
Oh, yeah... home visits...
All the other teachers have finished theirs.
That' s funny.
What is?
You' re turned into a real teacher.
What about you?
I wonder about that.
I don' t really understand...
What?
I thought I felt...
Rika?
Are you OK
Rika!
Rika, what' s wrong?!
Are you OK?
Uh, yeah...
Hello, Nishima.
Rika?
Mariko?
I' m sorry about today.
You scared me!
Are you all right now?
Yeah.
Thanks for asking.
I' m sorry I ruined your day off.
No, I' m OK.
Where are you now?
Remember that kid I told you about?
I' m at his house now.
Yeah...
There' s no one here but the boy.
His parents haven' t come home.
I' ve been here for an hour.
Mariko, where exactly are you?
Hello?
Hello, Rika?
Hello?
Hey.
Rika!
Toshio?
Toshio?
Toshio?
Toshio?
Are you up here?
Mariko!
Mariko...
Mariko?
Mariko?
No!
No!
No!
No!
You' re sweating.
A little turn...
Now side to side.
Can we talk out here for a minute?
What are you talking about?
I think she sings funny.
And her dancing' s not all that great either.
Yeah, but I had all the kits by then.
Because she didn' t take the kettle, so I was stuck.
Do you want me to take the kettle, Samuel?
No, I don' t, I just want Kathy to put it over here, This is, you know...
If you say these words, and then, boom, you just put your hands out, and there they are, They' re there.
Please don' t drop the props, Kathy,
Wait, wait.
Why are you putting it on her head, though?
I' m a little confused.
I don' t know, It was, uh...
It looks like you' re trying to... put a hat on her head or something.
You' re fantastic.
You just have to listen to your heart, Cvalda,
Okay, Paul, please,
You' re Cvalda to me,
Wait!
I told you no tapping in "The Sound of Music,"
It really needs rhythm,
Like drums or something,
Oh, hello, Selma, Come here,
- Are you ready?
Okay, you know where to stand,
Yeah,
So let' s try this one,
"F- E- Z- T,"
Maybe even this one,
I think you can work that machine safely,
I' il write a note to the plant and let them know,
Bye,
We lost five hours' cause some idiot broke the machine,
Bill' s here,
So?
Well, he' s here with Gene,
Oh, that sounds like bad news,
What are you going to do?
You can' t bring the script to work, Selma,
Keep your eyes on the machine, okay?
Bill' s here,
Bill?
He' s here with Gene,
You got to come right back, okay?
Don' t be too worried,
We' re gonna work this out,
Why are you not in school?!
Uhh...
Do you think I joke?
You have to study!
Come on, Selma, stop,
We talked about this, Didn' t we talk about it?
Hanging out with those automobile thieves,
He' s learning,
Aw, come on,
Gene, this is the most important thing,
Selma, l -- I can... drive him back to school if you like,
Since when was that your business?
What you doing here?
If you need a ride home --
I don' t even punch out until after another two hours,
Sometimes you punch out around this time,
I never punch out early!
Don' t need a ride!
All right,
Come on, Mr, G, Let' s get you to school,
Thank you, but I...
I' il just ride my bike,
She likes you,
I' m sure of it,
Yeah, I' m sure of it,
This is my punishment, that you help me with this,
And you' ve got...
And you forgot to wrap up the bread,
There' s no more of that,
You keep reading,
"So long, farewell, auf... wiedersehen... adieu, adieu, adieu, to yieu and yieu and yieu,"
"To yieu... and yieu..."
It' s your dumb musical,
"And yieu..."
It' s German,
- You think?
You want some more ketchup?
Are you tired?
Why -- why should you... always ask me so... so stupid questions?
Shall I show you my step?
Oh, hi, Hi, Gene,
Oh... good,
You want to come over to me and Bill' s place and listen to some music?
That -- that would be lovely,
Come on, Come on,
Yeah... uh...
You should ask Bill about his money,
You' re doing a very nice job with these,
You have to be very careful not to bend the card,
Uh- huh,
Otherwise I don' t get paid for it,
That' s fair, because... the people in the shops would never want to buy it if it' s bent,
You wouldn' t buy it if it was bent,
Wouldn' t buy anything if it was bent,
I saw a film, and they were eating candy from a tin just like this,
No,
I thought to myself... how wonderful it must be in the United States,
You think my house looks like a movie?
Oh, our house looks like a movie,
And you look like a movie star,
You know?
I know,
Of course, it' s all that money you inherited, isn' t it, Bill?
Hey, Selma...
Are you sure?
Hello,
I' ve got the rent,
Oh,
You always pay right on time,
Don' t worry about Gene, I' il get him off to school, okay?
Thanks very much,
Remember your bag,
I think you' re always so serious, Kathy,
Aw... again we start,
I don' t think inside you' re serious at all,
I don' t know,
Cvalda,
It' s like... someone who' s...
I don' t know, just big and happy,
I am not that big,
Happy?
Just need someone to pull it out,
Beautiful eyes,
But he' s not real happy, is he?
It' s when she cannot keep up, and she' s going to faint,
Please be quiet,
Oh, give us a break,
She doesn' t see that well,
Well, so did she.
I love it when they dance.
For Pete' s sake, it' s a musical.
Of course they' re dancing!
We know that!
Oh, you' re so smart.
I think you made friends, Kathy,
So, what' d she say?
What did she say?
She didn' t say anything,
Are you trying to tell me something?
It' s about the bike,
The bike?
Mm, the bike,
Oh, um, l -- I --
I cannot give Gene a bike,
No, it' s not his idea,
Did you ask them to come over?
No,
No, he didn' t, It doesn' t...
He doesn' t know anything, Selma, Frankly,
Why, have I done something?
I haven' t got the money,
I' m almost the only kid in class who doesn' t have a bike,
I even know a boy who' s got a scooter,
You know I haven' t got any money,
The only extra money I got the times I managed to save up,
I send it... to Grandpa,
- Come have a look, - I' m not gonna get you expensive things,
Your mother is only teasing,
Look what she' s brought for you!
It' s a bike!
We cannot accept that,
Selma, it was second- hand,
I can' t give him any expensive things,
- Yeah, but -- - I can' t even give it for his birthday,
I' m not that sort of mom,
I' m -- I' m --
I' m just not that kind of mother, Gene, I...
Can' t you be that kind of a mother?
It' s not exactly a scooter,
We' il see,
Careful!
Hey, gene, bring it over here,
He looks very happy, doesn' t he?
He does look happy,
Here he comes again,
Bring it over here,
Mom...
Did you hear what she said?
- She say okay?
Promise to go to school,
Yes, yes,
I didn' t know you were such a good biker,
Rust and women are the same,
"Rust and women are the same"?
What is it?
Your fat Yeah, id that?
I don' t know what it meant,
You' re so kind, Look at me,
He did all the work, you know that,
Thank you, Jeff!
You' re welcome,
Come in,
No, no, I just couldn' t sleep, that' s all,
I have no money,
All the money that I inherited is...
And Linda...
She spends and spends,
And my salary' s nowhere near enough,
I can' t say no to her,
The bank' s gonna repossess the house... because I' m so far behind on the payments,
And I' m gonna lose Linda,
I know it,
She loves you, Bill,
Oh, don' t cry,
I shouldn' t have told you,
Don' t worry,
- Shouldn' t have told you, - It' s okay,
Don' t worry,
No, I think you' ve got enough... stuff,
Would it make you feel better if I told you a secret?
What secret could you tell me?
I' m going blind,
Soon,
Maybe sometime this year,
Blind...
It' s not as bad as it sounds,
It' s a family thing,
But, blind?
From... when I was a little girl,
And you' re okay?
Well, I came to America because in America, they can give Gene an operation,
Gene?
He doesn' t know about it,
You... you mustn' t tell him, because then it could get worse,
I just have to save up money, you know, enough money to...
To, uh...
They can operate on Gene when he turns 1 3,
Huh,
I never had a father,
I made up his name, too,
And that' s why you put in all these hours and do all these pins and do everything you do,
For him,
Well, it is my fault,
How is it your fault?
I knew he would... he would have bad eyes like me,
But I had him... all the same,
You' re very strong,
I' m not strong,
I' ve got little games I play when it goes really hard,
When I' m working in the factory... and the machines, they make these... rhythms...
And I just start dreaming, and it all becomes music,
- I love the movies, - Yeah?
I just love the musicals,
Oh, when they' re all tap dancing?
All of them tap dancing, all of them, this huge, long line,
I... wouldn' t you like to be in that big, long line?
Kicking your feet up there?
When they' re, like, spiraling up the huge, enormous wedding cakes to the top?
Yeah,
But isn' t that annoying when they do the last song in the films, though?
Why?
Because you just know when it goes really big, and the camera goes, like, out of the roof, and you just know it' s gonna end,
I hate that,
I used to cheat on that when I was a little girl back in Czechoslovakia,
I would leave the cinema just after the next to last song, and the film would just go on forever,
It' s lovely, isn' t it?
That is lovely,
Selma...
Thank you for telling me your secret,
Thanks for telling me yours,
Mum' s the word, right?
"Mum"?
Oh, yes,
I won' t tell anyone,
Goodbye,
Oh, thank you,
Yeah, sure,
How about a big one?
How many is there in a big one?
I' il have a big one,
What' s this guy' s name again?
Who?
The old man, your old man, the guy we' re carding these pins for,
Her father?
I know, Oldrich,
Yeah,
Oldrich Novy,
He used to dance in Prague,
You commies make a big deal out of sharing everything,
Yeah,
It' s -- It' s a good thing,
Czechoslovakia' s so much better than the U, S, of A?
No, Selma, no!
There are two plates,
It' s all right,
You know what happens when you put two plates in, don' t you?
Well, she didn' t do it, I mean, it didn' t happen --
You destroy the tool,
It takes a whole day to mend,
Never two plates, Selma, never!
You cheated the doctor,
You shouldn' t be working at the press at all,
I mean, how dare you!
Just how much can you see?
I could do my job with my eyes closed,
So could you,
No,
It' s just because I was daydreaming,
Daydreaming?
Dreaming about what?
Come on, I mean, Selma, music?
You could also cut off your hand just like that, You have to watch out every second,
Promise me you' il stay awake,
I -- I promise I will stop daydreaming,
Aw, you' re not -- you repeat, but you don' t even listen to me,
I don' t know why I bother that much,
Hi, Selma,
If you' re not going with Kathy, can I give you a lift?
I -- I told you,
I just don' t have time for a boyfriend,
I know,
If I wanted a boyfriend, it would be you, Jeff,
I just don' t want one right now,
All right,
No problem, you know, on the back, to have the bike there,
Bye, Jeff,
- Selma?
Huh?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I' m fine,
Hello, Selm,
Hi, Bill,
Headed home?
Uh, yes,
Want to put it in the back?
Oh, that would be lovely, Yes, please,
Hi, Jeff,
Hey, Did you see the truck?
No?
They' re blind, driving like crazy,
He' s what?
He' s driving like crazy,
Getting dirty,
That' s all right,
Thank you,
Bye, Jeff,
Bye,
Thank you, Bill,
- Okay?
I' d have a bit more time,
Yeah,
All I need is a loan,
It' d just be a month,
This money is Gene' s,
I' m sorry, Bill,
That' s all right, I shouldn' t have asked,
Oh, you had to, Don' t worry, there' s no harm in asking,
No, no, I shouldn' t have asked,
Linda wants new couches,
I could always shoot myself,
You mustn' t say things like that,
It' s -- Make things easier,
- You know that, Bill, - Aw, Selma,
Selma, I' m kidding,
Hi, Selma, Come on in,
Good morning,
How are you?
Fine, thank you,
Yeah, go on, sure,
He' s a police officer,
I just didn' t know he would keep it here, in the house,
He keeps it in his desk,
It' s been the same for the whole period I' ve been here,
No, Selma, I won' t hear it,
You keep your money, You need it more than we do,
Two boxes?
Did you decide you are going to do two boxes at the same time now?
Selma... 1 0: 00 then?
1 0: 00,
What happens at 1 0: 00?
I' m -- I' m gonna do the night shift,
The night shift?
You can hardly see well enough to do your own shift,
It suits me fine,
It' s just after drama class,
I' ve had my fill of you, Selma,
You do what you want,
Go ahead, break your neck,
Do your night shift, but don' t think for one second
I' m going to come and rescue you,
Selma?
Kathy split already,
I was looking for you,
I just have to go to drama rehearsal,
You can always ride your bike,
You have it over there,
I left it at home,
I thought it' d be quicker if I walked,
How do you reckon that?
I just walk along the railroad tracks,
It' s a... shortcut,
Look, I don' t understand, In musicals... why do they start to sing and dance all of a sudden?
I mean, I don' t suddenly start... to sing and dance,
You' re right, Jeff, You don' t,
The last thing on the list is the bake sale,
Two sundays away,
Hi, Selma, Come on in, come on in,
I' m gonna introduce you to your understudy,
Yeah,
This girl Suzan, who boris knows, is a good singer, She' s a good dancer,
She' il learn your part, too, because, say, you get a cold, and... you can' t do it, then the show doesn' t have to stop,
Suzan, Selma, Selma, Suzan,
Could you take off your glasses?
I think we' il do the part without glasses,
Next sunday, you will see both Marias,
I mean, Selma will do the role, really, but... i' il have you read part of it too,
It' s your first time on the night shift, right?
While this is being pressed, you' il be cutting on the other machine,
That means you' il be in charge of two machines,
You have to beat Sarah over there, right?
This pallet must never be empty,
What?
Is it always so dark in here?
It' s exactly the same as the daytime,
Oh, Okay,
The only thing is you have to work a little faster,
- Okay, - Okay?
Thank you,
- Excuse me, - Yeah?
Okay,
What do you think?
Run along, Norman,
I' m on my own time now,
How I spend it is my own business,
'Night, ladies!
Good night!
Faster,
A little faster,
You should dance more...
I will dance when there is music,
Stop that, you' ve cut yourself!
Henry!
Hello, Jeff,
Hi, Kathy,
Do you live here?
Thought she might say yes to a ride when it' s this late,
No, it' s all right,
What' s that, with your hand?
She cut her...
Cut my finger,
Yeah, It' s going to be all right,
The plates are sharp,
Goodnight,
Careful,
I think I found a solution to our problem,
That makes me really happy,
It' s nothing special...
But I' ve made up my mind, I' m gonna tell Linda, and, uh...
I mean, after all, she loves me, and...
That sounds like a really good idea, Bill,
I' m sorry, I' il let you get to bed,
Thanks, Bill,
Good night, Selma,
Good night, Bill,
Bill?
What' s happening now?
Here we go, Selma, are you ready?
Cut, Cut, stop,
This is Selma' s entrance, okay?
Yeah?
I don' t know,
This is Maria' s entrance,
Yes, I' m sorry,
Please, please!
Let' s take this a little more seriously,
Okay, I' m thinking maybe, Selma...
You could take a little sort of circle around Boris on this next part, unless you have something else you wanna suggest,
Okay?
Yes?
Oh, Selma, please, if it' s about the drummer,
It' s not about the drummer,
Um... just a quick word,
Okay,
What?
My heart just isn' t in this...
Like, I shouldn' t be wasting my time on something... that isn' t... that important really,
She' s...
Terrific,
Suzan' s terrific, I' m not denying that, but you -- I thought you lived for musicals,
So you' ve been pretending the whole time?
Yes,
I' ve just been pretending,
I' ve got everything cast right now,
Yeah,
The only part that' s left is the old nun who lets maria out of the convent gate,
I don' t think you' d want that part,
There' s no dancing in that,
She' s quite serious then?
She' s serious,
It' s important for the part,
Okay, I' m not dancing really,
No,
You think so?
It -- I didn' t have it in mind,
You can have your tapping,
She could be just a little... humorous once in a while... even though she' s a nun,
You' il always be my perfect Maria,
Where are all the hairpins today?
And she won' t be playing Maria,
What do you reckon I' m gonna do if I can' t bawl you out for learning your lines on company time?
Three!
Well, she' s beating me,
I need a word with you,
We' re talking right now,
Come on,
Everything stops when the machine breaks,
You know that,
I -- I can do my job just fine... if I stick to the day shift,
Look, I daydream too much,
I -- I decided to quit,
And...
And I guess, then l -- I forgot,
I' ve been ordered to let you go, Selma,
I got them to agree to that,
This is your salary,
Maybe we can find you something away from the machines where your eyesight wouldn' t matter so much,
Not right away,
That' s very kind of you,
I better go,
I' il be okay, I really will,
Thank you, Selma,
Thank you,
Did you ever think about that?
I' m gonna be fine,
He' s usually here early, Selma, but not this early,
It' s a shame,
I -- I will need a lift...
Later,
I need to do something important at... at 3: 00,
Yeah,
Train' s coming, Get off the track, Jeff,
You have to be careful,
Stay to the side,
What is there to see?
I need to talk to Bill,
Is he -- is he upstairs?
Yeah,
Bill told me,
I want you to move out!
Wh- what would you know?
That you asked him into the trailer, but he turned you down!
No,
I want to talk to Bill,
Up to the trailer,
That you' d fallen in love with me,
And what did you tell her?
Nothing,
You didn' t tell her I was lying?
Linda told me you went to the bank,
I went to the bank to ask for more time,
But I couldn' t do it,
And I brought the box home instead,
Linda always gets so proud when she sees me sitting in here with it,
But you have put my money in it, haven' t you?
To make it look like it' s yours,
I couldn' t do that either,
I' m gonna have to take it,
Well, you can have it back,
You can have it back in a month,
Selma,
I -- I' ve decided to... to pay the doctor this afternoon,
Gene doesn' t even turn 1 3 until after christmas,
It was $2, 026 and 1 0 cents in the tin,
I can' t count it now, but I trust you,
And it' s... $30 I got today... which makes it 2, 056... and 1 0 cents,
It' s not enough,
But it' il have to do,
Selma, stop,
I don' t believe you,
I can' t see a gun,
Selma...
Just feel it!
Do you believe I have the gun?
I believe you,
No, it' s my money,
It' s the money I had in my box,
And you' re trying to steal it from me,
Selma!
Linda!
What' s the matter, Bill?
She tried to steal the money,
She knew I had the gun in my... in my drawer and she --
Is that why you wanted him, for the money?
Go get the handcuffs,
Give me the money,
Give me the money and i' il let you go,
Where should I go?
Just give me the money,
Just give me the money!
No, no, Selma,
Just kill me,
Will you just be my friend... and show some mercy, please, and just... kill me?
Your handcuffs aren' t in the car, Bill,
Linda, run,
Run up to Miller' s farm, Just run up to Miller' s farm and call the station, Tell them to hurry,
If you want the money...
you' re gonna have to kill me,
Don' t do this to me,
I' m not letting go,
Forgive me,
Uh, not really,
You cut yourself again,
There' s some blood on your blouse,
Selma...
Yeah, the bus stop,
It' s over there,
And the lake is here?
Dobry Vecer, Pane Doktore,
Dobry Vecer,
I would like to pay for the operation now, $2, 056... and 1 0 cents,
What last name shall I put on the receipt?
Oh, I don' t need a receipt,
I really don' t,
When he comes in for his operation,
Novy...
He will come, and he will say that his name is Novy,
And then you will know... that he has been paid for,
Novy?
Like Oldrich Novy, the tap dancer?
It is strange, isn' t it?
But he never really made it over here, did he?
I saw his films when I was a kid,
He was in the first musical
What about your rehearsal?
Yeah, I guess,
You want to go?
Yeah,
Then maybe put your arm around her, and... a little bit of...
Hi, Samuel,
We weren' t sure you' d show up, actually,
Sure, I' d show up,
Hi,
Nice to see you,
She' s here,
Okay, I think -- I think you could... try it one more time for me,
I think Gene may wonder where I am,
Jeff, he -- he hasn' t seen me all day,
Okay?
We haven' t done it in weeks, and we really need to rehearse it, and while you' re here, we might as well take advantage of the time, please?
Okay, let' s do the tapping scene,
Imagi -- you' re going to do
You like it?
Remember that part we did where -- where you, uh... you come to the convent gate to say goodbye to the -- to Maria?
I should leave, Jeff,
What?
Gene -- Gene is probably worried now,
All right,
I' m sorry, Samuel, but...
Betty, come here for a second, please,
The drummer that you wanted --
Remember, you asked me for a drummer?
I found somebody, She' s fantastic,
Her name' s Betty, She' s right here for the first time tonight,
Please meet her, Selma, this is Betty,
Hi, Betty,
You play the drums?
Yeah,
Tell her how long you' ve been studying,
She' s wonderful,
You' ve got to stay and enjoy this,
Let' s do the finale,
I just remembered, you hate finales,
I' ve a better idea,
The state will show that the defendant has not only perpetrated the most callous... and well- planned homicide in recent memory... but is also a fundamentally selfish individual... who cynically hides behind a handicap, devoid of sympathy for anybody but herself,
This woman found trust and friendship when she sought refuge in our country, and the evidence will show that she has repaid such kindness with betrayal, robbery, and murder, inflicted upon the very people who opened their homes and hearts to her,
The evidence will prove that she herself... did not show that mercy she will ask of us,
Is this the bag here, detective?
Yes, the very same,
Well, shortly before the homicide,
I had a checkup on her vision, and I found that she was myopic,
She could see,
She said communism was... better for human beings,
She had nothing but contempt for our great country and its principles?
Apart from its musicals, She said the American one... the American ones were better,
So... the defendant preferred Hollywood to Vladivostok,
I suppose that' s an acknowledgement of sorts,
She just asked many times about the money,
She wanted to know where it was?
She asked you about the gun?
She wanted to know where it was kept?
That' s right.
Bill was lying on the floor and... he was wounded,
And...
He was pleading for his life?
"I -- I beg you, I beg you,
You shall have no mercy either!
Selma Jezkova,
Yeah,
Yeah,
Yeah,
They bought him a... birthday present recently,
But you saw well enough to inflict 34 wounds on Bill Houston,
So why did you kill him, actually?
He asked me to,
He did?
A man with a fine career and some wealth, a happy marriage, why would this Bill Houston ask you to kill him?
I promised not to say,
Well, that clears things up immensely,
You promised you wouldn' t say,
In that case, we' il just have to take your word for it when you say that the money you stole that Bill Houston' s savings also disappeared so mysteriously that same day,
Just, uh...
Well...
I' d been saving up,
Well, I suppose you could call it that,
What were these savings to be used for?
My -- my father,
Your father?
My -- my father is...
We' re meant to believe... that you killed Bill Houston by inflicting 34 wounds on him because...
Just as we' re meant to believe that you were blind when you did it...
Are meant to believe that it was your own savings that you stole from him...
Just as we' re meant to believe that you sent all you had to your father back home, a man by the name of Oldrich Novy,
Yes,
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you' ve now heard from the defendant' s own lips,
You must believe her, just as you must believe her when she claims her father' s name is Oldrich Novy,
Your Honor... at this time, the state calls to the witness stand...
Please state your full name,
The name is Oldrich Novy,
And you used to live in Czechoslovakia?
That is right,
I live now in California, as you know,
That' s right, that' s where we found you,
I do not know her,
So...
You have not received money from her,
Money that -- that... she says was so dearly earned?
No, I have not,
Perhaps you' re not her father then?
No, I am not,
Well, if this relationship was made up by the defendant, then... can you think of any way she might' ve come to know your name?
I was once well known in Czechoslovakia uh... because of my profession,
Maybe that can give us a clue to why, why this somewhat... romantic, certainly communistic, woman who worships Fred Astaire but not his country, why she might' ve lied... and misused your name... to make us think all her money was spent on a poor father and not on her own vanity,
What is it that you do?
I was an actor, I made films,
Will the court please rise?
Have you reached a verdict?
Will the defendant please rise?
Selma Jezkova guilty of murder in the first degree and hereby sentence her to death,
Is this the verdict of this jury?
You fully understand that it must be unanimous?
Selma Jezkova...
You are hereby sentenced to be taken from this place and confined in the state penitentiary until such time as you shall be executed by being hanged by the neck until you are dead.
I' ve just heard about the...
Supreme Court decision,
Yeah, I...
On Gene' s birthday... he will receive a letter,
I need you to take care of that for me... because I' m not gonna be there when he gets it,
He should not be afraid, because there' s nothing to be afraid of, Kathy,
Listen, Gene wants to see you so badly,
There' s nothing for him to see,
He' s got you now, Kathy.
And there' s one more thing:
He has to call himself Novy,
That' s very important,
All right, time' s up, Selma,
Novy?
I' m sorry I didn' t tell you before about all this, I just didn' t dare to because they would ruin everything,
But what -- Why does he have to call himself Novy?
Please...
Iet me tell Gene hello... from you to him,
I know you love your son very much,
I love him very much,
Got a boy of my own back home,
You never told me that,
Good night, Brenda,
Say hi to your son from me,
Thank you, Selma,
Jezkova...
Selma Jezkova?
Well, if it wasn' t too long ago,
Sorry, there' s no one here by that name,
What about Novy?
I have good news for you,
What' s that?
We found a new lawyer... and he' s going to get your case re- opened,
What do you mean?
Well, the case is going to be re- opened,
Is that true?
Yes, New information has turned up,
Wh- what information?
Well, we know the whole story, Selma,
You know, about... about the money for Gene' s operation,
How did you find out?
Does -- does Gene know?
I mean, have you told Gene?
No, No, I didn' t,
But you' ve got a much better case now,
That' s very important, Kathy,
His eyes might get worse from worrying, and then the operation won' t work,
Yes, but, Selma...
Don' t you see that it would help you if they knew that you were trying to save your son from going blind?
The lawyer, he' il come and see you in two weeks' time,
We know that, but he says you can apply for a stay,
You know, most cases get one the first time,
Well, you can smile,
Yeah... it' s just too much for me,
I thought I was strong,
I just can' t take it, Kathy,
Apply for a stay,
What if they don' t phone?
Uh, well, you' il be transferred to the other... cell block at some point tomorrow,
That' s the cell block where they hang people,
Yeah, that' s where they... spend the last day,
It' s from that room... to the gallows, isn' t it?
That' s what they say, Selma, but...
You' re gonna get your stay,
Why don' t you try to think of something nice, all right?
It' s just so quiet here,
What' s that got to do with it, Selma?
You know, when I used to work in the factory...
I used to dream that I was in a musical, because, in a musical, nothing dreadful ever happens,
But it' s so quiet here,
Don' t the prisoners march or something?
Yeah?
No, they don' t, They don' t...
There' s not...
But later they turn on the radio,
No, no, no, There' s no...
But I' ve been listening to the ventilation... shaft,
I hear sometimes people singing there,
That' s not against the rules, to listen, is it?
I wonder if... if maybe you' re hearing the singing coming from the chapel,
Yeah?
Maybe you' il even get a sermon,
Selma...
I' m so happy for you,
I' m your new legal counsel,
My name is Luke, okay?
I' m, uh, quite sure...
I can get your sentence commuted,
AlI need is a signature stating you want the case re- opened... and then I can get all the paperwork ready by tomorrow,
Yeah,
There' s a lot of things your other lawyer didn' t do that I' m going to do,
A lot of ground that wasn' t covered that I am going to cover,
The fact that you were fighting for your boy is something we can really milk,
I have some experience in cases like this, so...
That' s what the attorney before said,
You see, he was appointed by the court, and you don' t get the best legal counsel that way,
Y- You were not appointed by the court?
You' re gonna have to pay me,
But... not to worry,
That' s been taken care of,
Deal?
Yeah, in regard to my fee,
I' ve agreed to accept the amount that she said she could raise,
How much...
Well, I can tell you precisely, because I received an envelope,
It' s, uh, two thousand dollars -- $2, 056, 1 0?
That' s it precisely,
I' d like to just sort of go over our tactics,
I have a couple of questions to ask you,
If he doesn' t have the operation next month, it' s gonna be too late!
And he will never be able to see!
This is what it' s all about, so he can see his grandchildren!
Well, let me tell you something,
The only thing that' s important to me in my whole life, and you don' t understand, Kathy!
- Listen to me!
- Listen to me!
- Waste that kind of money... on a blind woman who' s gonna spend the rest of her life in jail!
But he needs his mother, you know, alive, no matter where!
He needs his eyes!
- He needs his mother!
- No!
- No!
Selma,
I listen to my heart,
I will go to the police, I will tell them that... you stole the money from... from Bill,
Oh, yes, I will tell that,
I will tell them that, that you stole it from Bill, and you will never see the money again!
That will be gone for good,
Nothing!
You can have your money back,
I just want to make sure that you fully comprehend what this means, this decision,
You fully realize what will happen?
I already asked for no more stays,
Once this starts, there' s no stopping it,
Yeah,
Gene says thank you,
Thanks for what?
Oh, some comic books on his birthday,
You can' t buy him... presents and say it' s from me,
You have to stop doing that, Jeff,
phone him,
Just say, you know... something to him,
He wants to be the one... who' s allowed to be there when it happens,
But l -- And then they told him he' s too young,
Who put that crazy idea into his head anyway?
I don' t want him to be there,
I' il be there if you would,
And Kathy?
You know Kathy, She' s...
She' s still angry,
I would love you to be there,
Don' t cry, Jeff,
Why did you have him?
You knew he would have the same disease as you,
I just wanted to hold a little baby...
I love you,
It' s time, Selma,
Your meal, Jezkova,
It' s time,
Please stand,
She can walk on her own,
Selma...
I' m afraid my legs aren' t working very well,
You can do it, Selma,
Yeah,
You' re gonna stand up with me,
Yeah,
I may make some noise,
It will give you something to listen to,
Listen,
There' s 1 07 steps,
I couldn' t even do one,
You can do it,
Now listen, Selma,
I want you to do one -- there, one,

Selma Jezkova, do you have any last words?
Very well, Proceed,
Selma, you okay?
It' s okay, It' s okay,
Use the board,
Oh, no, no, No, wait, Give her a chance,
She can stand up, She can stand,
It' s okay, It' s okay,
I' m scared,
It' s okay,
- I know,
On the mark,
I can' t do the hood!
It' s okay, Selma,
I have to breathe!
Nobody told me about the hood!
- I can' t breathe!
I can' t breathe!
- Look, look -- - I can' t breathe!
I have to breathe!
Look, she can' t breathe,
She can' t breathe!
I' m taking it, I' m taking it,
This is irregular,
I don' t care if it' s irregular,
- We have regulations, - She' s blind --
I don' t care about the regulations!
The girl is blind, for Christ' s sake,
I' m gonna make a call,
Gene...

Waiting for a call,

He is just outside,
You were right, Selma!
