It' s 4: 15 on a Saturday morning in El Paso town.
This is Uncle Bruce here going on with the farm and market report... on the station all El Paso listens to.
My mother told me never to do this.
Bless you.
My name' s Jim Halsey.
John Ryder.
So you want me to drop you off somewhere?
I' m getting your car wet.
Oh, this isn' t my car.
It' s a drive- away.
The owner' s in San Diego.
So where you headed?
- You got a smoke?
- Yeah, sure.
You gonna tell me where you' re going?
Yeah, sure.
What are you looking at me like that for?
Just looking.
What are you doing?
What' d you do that for?
I asked you a question.
Scare you?
Look, I think you better get out now.
The ride' s over.
Good- bye.
and you' re gonna drive.
Excuse me.
- What' s wrong with that car back there?
Thought I saw something, that' s all.
- I ran out of gas.
- So you need a gas station?
Would help.
Okay.
Gas stations have cigarettes.
What about gas?
I don' t need gas.
What do you want?
What' s so funny?
That' s what the other guy said.
Who' s the other guy?
The guy who was driving that car back there.
Picked me up before you did.
- Was that him in the car?
- I' m sure it was.
He couldn' t have walked very far.
Why is that?
Because I cut off his legs... and his arms... and his head.
And I' m gonna do the same to you.
Don' t.
What part of illinois you from?
- What?
- Your license plate.
Tell the man.
Chicago.
My wife' s from Rockford.
You got a cigarette?
All right, the road' s clear now.
Get going, sweethearts.
Drive.
You want to know what happens to an eyeball when it gets punctured?
You got any idea how much blood jets out of a guy' s neck... when his throat' s been slit?
What do you want?
I want you to stop me.
You got the knife.
You' il stick me with it before I can do anything.
So what have you got to lose?
Stop me.
Crying isn' t gonna help.
Keep driving!
Please.
I' il do anything.
Say four words:
Say...
"I want to die."
Say what?
"I want to die."
Say it.
- I don' t know if I can say that.
- Sure you can.
Repeat after me.
"I...
want...
to...
die. "
I don' t want to die!
Fuck you, buddy!
Jesus Christ!
Pull over!
Pull over!
The guy in your car' s a nut!
Shoot him.
That guy' s a fucking nut in your car!
Pull over!
- Kill him.
- That guy will kill you!
That guy, get him out of your car!
Where do you think you' re going?
Come back!
Oh, fuck.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Hey, stop!
Stop!
Wait!
- Okay, see you at 4: 00.
- Bye- bye.
Shit.
We' re closed.
We don' t open for another 45 minutes.
Please, I need to use a phone!
Sorry.
I can' t let you in.
We' re closed.
Listen.
- Please, I have to call the cops.
- What happened?
I can' t explain right now.
I just need to use the phone.
If Jack saw me doing this, he' d kick my butt.
Phone' s around the corner.
You stink of gasoline.
Were you in an accident?
Hello, police?
I know who killed those people in --
I picked this guy up hitchhiking --
Same guy blew up the gas station.
Jim Halsey.
H- A- L- S- E- Y.
I' m at the Longhorn Restaurant.
You do?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I won' t go anywhere.
Jesus.
If you think the cops are gonna arrive soon, you got another thing coming.
A guy got shot in the corner a couple months ago.
It took them 45 minutes to get here with the ambulance.
By that time the poor guy was dead.
Specialty of the house.
ActuaIly the cook' s not here yet.
It' s the only thing I know how to make.
That' s real nice of you.
Everything gonna be okay?
I hope so.
You sure look a whole lot better.
Guess it' s safe for me to smoke now, huh?
Sorry I gave you such a hard time, but... you' d be surprised the kind of trash that passes through here.
- How is it?
- Real good.
Thanks.
My name' s Nash.
I really appreciate this.
- Where you from?
- Chicago.
- Where you headed?
- California.
How' d you know that?
That' s where everyone' s going.
Hollywood?
No.
San Diego.
I thought about moving to California.
Jeremy, who owns this place -- he' s my cousin.
And Uncle Jack does the cooking.
Like that, see?
We' re all kind of interrelated.
It' s kind of hard to just pick up and leave.
But you never know.
My brother Bill is from Mars.
Actually we' re all from Mars here.
We keep our spaceship out back.
So, what planet are you from?
What?
You haven' t heard a word I said, have you?
Yes, I have.
That' s okay.
Eat your cheeseburger.
I gotta get some stuff out of the freezer anyway.
Stay where you are!
Put your hands in the air.
Get down on the ground!
Wait a minute!
Get your ass on the cement, or we open fire!
I' m not gonna tell you again!
Put your hands behind your back slow.
- My wallet' s in my pocket.
- Shut up!
We know how to do it.
Jesus!
Oh, my God!
He put that there!
Now shut up.
Don' t move.
What' s going on?
What' d you do to him?
- You keep to yourself.
- Why you arresting him?
Pick up that stuff.
Do you know this guy?
Not really.
Then what the hell is he doing inside?
Half the cops in the state are looking for this creep.
Let' s get this sack of shit out of here.
Where' s your driver' s license, your I. D.?
Where are your credit cards?
The guy I' ve been telling you about took my wallet and planted the knife.
My license was in my wallet.
I don' t have any credit cards.
I suppose he took your vehicle registration too?
What' s a young kid like you driving such a fancy car?
You steal it?
The car doesn' t belong to me.
It' s a drive- away.
I' m supposed to be delivering it to California.
The guy' s in San Diego.
What' s his name?
I don' t remember.
But I know the number of the drive- away company.
Why don' t you call them?
You better start calling somebody 'cause you' re in deep shit.
It' s 312- 399- 2090.
I know the number so well because I called them so many times.
I was on their waiting list for a month.
I wanted a car going to California.
That' s why it took so long.
Thank you for calling Midwest Drive- away.
Our Chicago office hours are 9: 00 to 5: 00, Monday through Friday.
Closed Saturday and --
Well, now what are we gonna do?
You got one more call.
He' il be home.
It' s 312- 905- 9044.
Maybe you didn' t let it ring long enough.
Do I look like a killer to you?
Folks coming in from Austin tomorrow gonna be interested in talking to you.
I' m gonna give you a chance to get some rest.
Get him locked up.
Get him out of my sight.
Let' s go.
Jack?
That kid isn' t a killer.
Any fool could see that.
Okay, face front.
Hold real still.
Now turn to your right.
Steady.
Make it your left.
Oh, those are real good.
Your mama' s gonna like those.
Let' s go.
You behave yourself now.
Hello?
I' m right behind you.
Come on!
Let' s go.
Come on, come on.
Stop!
- Take her easy!
- Tell me about it.
Get over by the car.
Those cuffs on your belt... take them off and lock your partner' s hands behind his back.
- You mean me?
- I mean you.
You!
Yes, you!
Okay.
We' re gonna go for a little ride now.
You two get in the front.
I' il get in the back.
- One of you open the door.
- Open the door, Jack.
Get in the car!
You and me, we' re gonna get in together, okay?
Ready... steady... go.
- Can I close the door?
- Shut the door.
Start the car.
Head for the highway.
Can you call out on that thing and get me connected with somebody in charge?
Do it.
But don' t tell anybody where we are.
- Central, this is car number -- - I said don' t tell them anything.
Central, this is one of your cars and we' ve been hijacked by suspect.
Over.
Esteridge 10- 11.
Standby.
10- 12, El Paso.
This is Captain Esteridge.
Over.
Captain, this is Jim Halsey.
You gotta listen to me, Captain.
I swear I didn' t kill those people.
I got framed by this guy I picked up hitchhiking.
What do you suggest we do, son?
Come on, man.
You tell me.
let my men go and give yourself up?
I don' t have identification.
I don' t have anybody to call for you to check me out.
Are you willing to lay down your arms and surrender?
I promise I' il do everything in my power to see to it you' re treated fairly.
I' m putting my trust in you, Captain.
Take us in.
Bang.
Well, I know you caught something... because you' re probably the best dang fisherman around here.
But if that' s the best you can eat...
I don' t know what you' re gonna be able to do.
That' il tide us over until --
Looks to me like you best go.
- Better get on the road.
- Yeah, I' il see you.
Bye, Alice.
Well, what happened to you?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Nothing happened.
- I need some coffee.
- It' s brewing.
- Bring it to me at one of the booths.
- You okay, kid?
How do you like Shitsville?
Don' t you move.
You stay seated right where you are... or I' il blow your brains through your ass.
The gun is empty.
You never checked it, did you?
So help me, I' il blow you in half.
All right.
Squeeze the trigger.
I will.
- Please.
- Oh, I will.
'Cause you can sure as shit bet I' m gonna squeeze mine.
Bam!
Why are you doing this to me?
Come here.
You' re a smart kid.
Figure it out.
I didn' t do it.
I didn' t do any of it.
I' m not gonna shoot anybody.
I' m not a killer.
This morning this guy tried to kill me.
He' s been following me ever since.
I don' t know why.
Do you believe me?
Sure.
No, you don' t.
I wouldn' t either.
Let' s go sit down.
What are you gonna do?
Give up.
I have no choice.
Nice and easy.
Come on.
Step down.
All right, step down.
I' m turning myself in.
Get out from behind the door!
Step away from the bus.
Get down!
Move!
Move your ass now!
I' m giving up and I' m not guilty.
You just wasted two of my friends.
- You spit on my wrist.
- What?
I said, "You spit on my wrist."
Wipe it off.
You can see I' m unarmed.
Wipe it off!
- Come on, Lyle.
Go easy.
- Shut up!
- Let' s get him back to the station.
- I said, "Shut up!"
Wipe it off!
Put the gun down.
Goddamn you.
Drop your guns!
Don' t turn around.
Just drop them.
I can' t believe you were gonna do what you were gonna do.
Don' t you know who he is?
You got the wrong man, Lyle.
Like hell we do.
Now just settle down and --
- Don' t come any closer.
- Hand me that gun.
Just empty them.
You' re in enough trouble already.
You just threw your life down the toilet, girl.
When the truth comes down, I' il be just fine.
You stay put.
Let' s go.
- Now what?
- We' re going to Riley.
- Do you know how to use the radio?
- I better let you out here.
If I' m in the car with you, they' re not gonna hurt you.
- We can talk to them by radio.
- What are you gonna say?
We' re gonna turn ourselves in.
Buckle your seat belt.
Do mine.
Hello?
Can you read me?
We want to turn ourselves in.
We' re turning ourselves in.
Can you read me?
Listen to me this time.
We are turning ourselves in.
We just want to turn ourselves in!
Hello!
The bastard' s on his way.
Hold it there.
That' s a good speed.
Shit.
Get the gun!
Use it!
- No, I' m not gonna shoot anybody!
- Aim for the tire.
- Oh, God!
- They' re gonna kill us!
- Use it!
- No!
I got you.
Jesus Christ!
Use the gun!
Shoot back!
You got him.
Watch it.
She' s got a gun.
Watch it.
Get down.
You got him.
I dropped the gun.
You what?
Get the shotgun!
Be careful, now.
There you go.
Hold on!
Holy shit!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I' m okay.
1073, 221, are you okay?
Let' s go, you son of a bitch!
Oh, God.
Come on.
Let' s get out of here.
- Why didn' t he kill us?
- Let' s go.
Why didn' t he kill us?
Let' s go.
Are you okay?
Why' d you pick him up?
I wanted to help him... and I was tired.
I thought he' d help me stay awake.
Can I sit by you?
- What are you doing?
- I want to call my father.
- No.
No calls.
- It' s only my father.
I said, no calls.
Not until we figure out what we' re gonna do.
I can explain it.
It' s not that simple.
I already tried.
I' m scared.
Me too.
Thanks.
Nash?
Are you awake?
Let' s head 'em out!
Don' t --
I' m okay.
I just want you to know where I am.
Everybody' s got this whole thing wrong.
No, I sound funny, but I' m okay.
The Apostle Paul told us to look within ourselves... for the very spirit of faith.
You must look to nature where the spirit is replenished daily.
I' m Reverend Hollis Maxwell inviting you to visit a church this Sunday.
Iicensed by the F. C. C. in Washington, D. C... ending its broadcast day.
We invite you to join us tomorrow at 6: 00 a. m.
All right.
Don' t hurt him, Ed.
You take it easy now.
Are you Jim Halsey?
- Who are you?
- I' m Captain Esteridge.
We spoke on the radio.
Where is she?
You come along with us now.
We' re gonna need your help.
Hostage situation.
Hold your fire.
Hold it!
Please, don' t!
Why don' t you do something?
We can' t!
Hold it!
- Do something!
If we shoot him, his foot will come off that clutch, and that truck will roll.
Please!
Now, you get in there and you see what you can do.
Please, do something!
Please, help!
She' s sweet.
The gun is loaded.
Go for it.
Go ahead.
Pick it up.
Tell you what -- I' il let you hold the gun on me before I do anything.
They' il catch you.
Please!
Yeah.
Sure.
So what?
Pick up the gun.
Do something!
Put it in my face.
Right there.
That' s good.
You know what to do.
Now do it.
Squeeze the trigger.
She' il die.
Oh, God.
You useless... waste.
I can' t tell you how sorry I am for you, son.
Anything I can do for you?
When you' re finished here, you should go see a real doctor... and get a complete checkup.
We all know there was nothing you could do.
- Who is he?
- We don' t know.
No prison record, no driver' s license... no birth certificate.
We ran his prints through the computers... and we came up with nothin '.
I know we' il find something, but right now, I don' t even know his name.
How do you feel?
Tired.
He can' t see us or hear us.
I want to talk to him.
What' s your name?
Come on.
Come on.
What' s your name?
Do you have a name?
John Ryder.
What' d you say?
His name is John Ryder.
Do you have a police record?
Where are you from?
Disneyland.
How long do we have to play this game?
Y' all give me a minute?
Come on.
All right, that' s enough of that.
It was a bad idea in the first place.
Captain Esteridge, is it true that --
No comment.
All right, son.
Get in the car.
Are you okay?
You' il never hold him.
All right, you listen up now, and you listen good, son.
There' s something strange between you.
I don' t want to know what it is.
But I' m telling you, he is in our hands now... and whatever happens to him, it won' t be decided by you.
It doesn' t have anything to do with you anymore.
Okay?
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
Sure.
Stop the car.
You' re not gonna use that thing.
Stop the car, and don' t do anything stupid.
All right.
What' s on your mind?
Get out.
You' re gonna get yourself killed.
And if you don' t, you' re gonna be in a whole lot of trouble.
I' m sorry, sir.
- It' s something I gotta do.
- You don' t know what you' re doin '.
Yeah...
I do.
Hi, kid.
Come on.
Come on!
23. 976
Frodo?
Frodo!
- I thought I' d lost you.
- What are you taking about?
- It' s just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say? » Don' t you lose him, Samwise Gamgee. » And I don' t mean to.
Sam, we' re still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?
Frodo.
- Merry, it' s Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.
Get off him.
What' s the meaning of this?
You' ve been into Farmer Maggot' s crop!
You get back here!
Get out of my field!
I don' t know why he' s so upset.
And some cabbages.
And those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week.
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
My point is...... he' s clearly overreacting.
Run!
Oh, that was close.
I think I' ve broken something.
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!
What?
That was just a detour.
A short cut.
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!
That' s mine.
I think we should get off the road.
Get off the road!
Quick!
Be quiet!
What was that?
Anything?
Nothing.
What is going on?
That Black Rider was looking for something.
Or someone.
Frodo?
Get down!
I have to leave the Shire.
Sam and I must get to Bree.
Right.
Follow me.
Run!
This way!
Follow me!
Get the rope, Sam!
Frodo!
Go!
Faster!
- How far to the nearest crossing?
20 miles.
Come on.
- What do you want?
- We' re heading for the Prancing Pony.
Hobbits.
Four Hobbits!
What' s more, out of the Shire by your talk.
What business brings you to Bree?
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.
I meant no offense.
It' s my job to ask questions after nightfall.
There' s talk of strange folk abroad.
Can' t be too careful.
Excuse me.
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?
If you' re seeking accommodation, we got some cozy Hobbit- sized rooms available.
Always proud to cater to the Little Folk, Mister...?
Underhill.
- Underhill, yes.
- We' re friends of Gandalf the Grey.
- Can you tell him we' ve arrived?
- Gandalf?
Elderly chap.
Big grey beard, pointy hat.
Not seen him for six months.
What do we do now?
He' il come.
What' s that?
This, my friend, is a pint.
It comes in pints?
- I' m getting one.
- You got a whole half already!
That fellow' s done nothing but stare at you since we arrived.
Excuse me.
Who is he?
He' s one of them Rangers.
They' re dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.
Strider.
Baggins?
Sure, I know a Baggins.
Frodo Baggins.
He' s my second cousin, once removed on his mother' s side...... and my third cousin, twice removed....
- Steady on, Frodo.
You cannot hide.
I see you.
You draw far too much attention to yourself, « Mr. Underhill. »
What do you want?
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.
I can avoid being seen if I wish...... but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.
- Who are you?
Yes.
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.
Or I' il have you, Longshanks.
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.
You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.
They' re coming.
What are they?
They were once Men.
Great kings of Men.
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them nine rings of power.
Blinded by their greed, they took them without question.
One by one, falling into darkness.
Now they are slaves to his will.
They are the Nazgul.
Ringwraiths.
Neither living nor dead.
At all times they feel...... the presence of the Ring...... drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the Wild.
How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf?
-... and feel fouler.
- He' s foul enough.
We have no choice but to trust him.
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.
- To the house of Elrond.
Rivendell.
We' re going to see the Elves.
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?
- You' ve already had it.
What about second breakfast?
Don' t think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.
What about elevenses?
Luncheon?
Afternoon tea?
Supper?
- He knows about them, doesn' t he?
- I wouldn’ t count on it.
Pippin!
What do they eat when they can' t get Hobbit?
Who is she?
This woman you sing of.
'Tis the lady of Luthien.
The Elf- maiden who gave her love to Beren, a mortal.
What happened to her?
She died.
Get some sleep, Frodo.
The power of Isengard is at your command......
Sauron, Lord of the Earth.
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?
We have work to do.
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.
Rip them all down.
This was the great watchtower of Amon Sul.
We shall rest here tonight.
These are for you.
Keep them close.
I' m going to have a look around.
Stay here.
My tomato' s burst.
Want a tomato, Sam?
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.
- We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
- Put it out, you fools!
- Put it out!
Ash on my tomatoes!
Go!
Back, you devils!
Frodo!
Oh, Sam.
Strider!
- Help him, Strider.
- He' s been stabbed by a Morgul blade.
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.
Hurry!
We' re six days from Rivendell!
He' il never make it!
Hold on, Frodo.
Gandalf!
Look, Frodo.
It' s Mr. Bilbo' s trolls.
Mr. Frodo?
He' s going cold.
Is he going to die?
He' s passing into the Shadow World.
He' il soon become a Wraith like them.
- They' re close.
- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.
Kingsfoil, aye, it' s a weed.
It may help to slow the poisoning.
What' s this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?
Frodo.
Who is she?
- She' s an Elf.
- He' s fading.
He' s not going to last.
We must get him to my father.
- I' ve been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.
What are they saying?
I do not fear them.
Don' t look back.
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!
Give up the halfling, She- Elf.
If you want him, come and claim him.
Frodo, no.
Frodo, don' t give in.
Not now.
What grace is given me...... let it pass to him.
Let him be spared.
Save him.
- Where am I?
And it is 1 0: 00 in the morning on October 24th, if you want to know.
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I' m here.
And you' re lucky to be here too.
A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid.
But you have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.
What happened, Gandalf?
- Why didn' t you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.
I was delayed.
A friendship with Saruman is not lightly thrown aside.
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.
Embrace the power of the Ring...... or embrace your own destruction!
There is only one lord of the Ring.
And he does not share power.
So you have chosen death.
Gandalf?
What is it?
Nothing, Frodo.
- Sam.
- Bless you, you' re awake!
Sam has hardly left your side.
We were that worried about you.
Weren' t we, Mr. Gandalf?
By the skills of Lord Elrond, you' re beginning to mend.
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.
- Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.
Bilbo.
A Hobbit' s Tale, by Bilbo Baggins. »
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...... wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...... visit Lake- town...... see the lonely Mountain again.
But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.
I miss the Shire.
I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else.
Off with you, on one of your adventures.
But my own adventure turned out to be quite different.
I' m not like you, Bilbo.
My dear boy.
- Now, what have I forgotten?
No harm in being prepared.
- I thought you wanted to see the Elves.
- I do.
- More than anything.
- I did.
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn' t we?
Off home.
You are right, Sam.
We did what we set out to do.
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.
I am ready to go home.
His strength returns.
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.
And yet to have come so far still bearing the Ring...... the Hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil.
It is a burden he should never have had to bear.
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.
Sauron' s forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.
Our list of allies grows thin.
His treachery runs deeper than you know.
By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orcs with Goblin- men.
He' s breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.
An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed.
Saruman is coming for the Ring.
This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves.
We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard!
Gandalf...... the Ring cannot stay here.
This peril belongs to all Middle- earth.
They must decide now how to end it.
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.
Who will you look to when we' ve gone?
The Dwarves?
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.
It is in Men that we must place our hope.
Men?
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.
The blood of Numenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten.
It is because of Men the Ring survives.
I was there, Gandalf.
I was there 3000 years ago...
... when Isildur took the Ring.
I was there the day the strength of Men failed.
Isildur, hurry!
Follow me.
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom...... where the Ring was forged, the one place it could be destroyed.
Cast it into the fire!
- Destroy it!
Isildur!
It should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure.
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.
There' s no strength left in the world of Men.
- They' re scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.
He turned from that path a long time ago.
He has chosen exile.
You are no Elf.
Men of the South are welcome here.
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.
Then we are here on common purpose...... friend.
The shards of Narsil.
The blade that cut the Ring from Sauron' s hand.
It' s still sharp.
But no more than a broken heirloom.
Why do you fear the past?
You are Isildur' s heir, not Isildur himself.
You are not bound to his fate.
The same blood flows in my veins.
The same weakness.
Your time will come.
And you will defeat it.
You said you' d bind yourself to me...... forsaking the immortal life of your people.
And to that I hold.
I would rather share one lifetime with you...... than face all the Ages of this world alone.
I choose a mortal life.
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...
... like my heart.
Strangers from distant lands, friends of old...... you' ve been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor.
Middle- earth stands upon the brink of destruction.
None can escape it.
You will unite, or you will fall.
Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.
So it is true.
In a dream...... I saw the eastern sky grow dark...... but in the West a pale light lingered.
A voice was crying: » Your doom is near at hand.
Isildur' s Bane is found. »
Isildur’ s Bane.
Boromir!
Never before has any voice uttered the words of that tongue here in Imladris.
I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond...... for the Black Speech of Mordor...... may yet be heard...... in every corner of the West!
The Ring is altogether evil.
It is a gift.
A gift to the foes of Mordor.
Why not use this Ring?
Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor...... kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...... are your lands kept safe.
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.
And what would a Ranger know of this matter?
This is no mere Ranger.
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
You owe him your allegiance.
Aragorn.
This is Isildur’ s heir?
And heir to the throne of Gondor.
Gondor has no king.
Gondor needs no king.
Aragorn is right.
We cannot use it.
You have only one choice.
The Ring must be destroyed.
What are we waiting for?
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin...... by any craft that we here possess.
The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.
Only there can it be unmade.
It must be taken deep into Mordor...... and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came.
One of you...... must do this.
One does not simply walk into Mordor.
Its Black Gates are guarded by more than just Orcs.
There is evil there that does not sleep.
The Great Eye is ever- watchful.
It is a barren wasteland...... riddled with fire, and ash and dust.
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.
Not with 1 0, 000 men could you do this.
It is folly.
Have you heard nothing lord Elrond has said?
The Ring must be destroyed.
And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!
And if we fail, what then?
What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?
I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf!
Never trust an Elf!
I will take it.
I will take it.
I will take the Ring to Mordor.
Though...... I do not know the way.
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins...... as long as it is yours to bear.
If by my life or death I can protect you...... I will.
You have my sword.
And you have my bow.
And my ax.
You carry the fates of us all, little one.
If this is indeed the will of the Council...... then Gondor will see it done.
- Frodo' s not going anywhere without me.
- It is hardly possible to separate you...... even when he is summoned to a secret Council and you are not.
We' re coming too!
You' il have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us.
Anyway, you need people of intelligence on this sort of...... mission.
Quest.
Thing.
Well, that rules you out, Pip.
Nine companions.
So be it.
You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring.
Great!
Where are we going?
Carmen, Juni, time for bed.
- Did you brush your teeth?
- I already did.
- Juni, don' t forget to brush -- - I am, I am.
All right, all right.
JUNl:
OK, warts.
Uhh!
Prepare to meet your maker.
Everything OK at school?
It' s fine.
Well, lights out.
Bedtime story first.
What story do you want to hear?
"The Two Spies Who Fell In Love."
Wow.
I haven' t told that one in a while.
You probably remember that better than I do.
- Want to hear a story, Juni?
- I' m listening.
OK.
Once upon a time... there was a man and a woman.
- And they were both spies.
- Yes.
She from one country, he from another.
She had a very important mission assigned to her.
- He was her mission.
- Correct.
Her mission was to take him out.
On a date?
Uh, take him --
Oh, you mean...
I shouldn' t be telling you this.
Go on.
- You have to understand... these were dark and confusing times.
An enormous amount of turmoil between countries.
INGRlD:
Out off ear... a new kind of soldier was created -- brilliant, brave soldiers... whose greatest weapons were their minds.
Those men and women were spies.
They were masters of disguise.
They could sense danger a mile away... and through their work... wars were ended before they even started.
The only things spies were truly afraid of... were other spies -- enemy spies.
So, sometimes, one spy' s mission... was to make the enemy disappear.
He was the assignment that changed her life... but when the moment finally came... to carry out her mission...
she couldn' t do it.
He was different than she expected.
Sure, he was charming and intelligent... but he was unexpectedly honorable... and it made her realize... how years of working with detached emotion... had taken its toll.
So they kept contact... through lunch dates -- very discreet.
After all, they were on different sides... so they could never be seen together.
Dinner dates followed... wherever their mutual travels took them.
And they fell in love... and they decided that, together... they would embark... on the most dangerous mission of all time.
What?
They decided to marry.
Wow.
INGRlD:
On her wedding day... she felt like she would rather brave... a thousand deadly missions... than go through with what she was about to attempt.
Why is that?
Well, marriage is a mission so complex... that only the most courageous and slightly insane need apply.
There' s such an amazing series of obstacles... one has to navigate to keep a marriage together -- much less family -- that it frightened even her... a hardened and experienced secret agent.
looked deep into his eyes... and said the two most dangerous... most trusting words you can say to anyone.
What?
She said, "I do."
Oh, that' s so cool.
Then the problems started.
Now, there was always some faction... that wanted at least one of them gone.
On their own, each agent was notorious... but together, they made tempting targets.
So, they retired... settled down... had a few kids.
In a way, they exchanged... one life of adventure for another... trading espionage for parenthood -- a mysterious and compelling mission in its own right.
And they' re better off.
The end.
No "happily ever after"?
I said they were better off.
Great story, Mom, but it needs a new ending.
It needs monsters.
Is that right?
Do you want me to look at your --
I put the medicine on.
OK, munchkin.
Good night.
What was the story tonight?
Mmm.
Ours.
How many nights, I wonder... do you send the children off to bed with nightmares?
Carmen asked for the story.
That life is over now.
We are consultants, not spies.
So I went to their school today.
Mm- hmm.
Had that meeting with the principal.
Hmm?
Carmen' s been skipping school twice a month.
- Why?
- I don' t know.
And those school friends Juni talks about having?
Yeah.
Diego somebody and Renaldo?
No such beasts.
It turns out, the other kids pick on him.
He has no friends.
It doesn' t help that he has his head in the clouds... making these weird drawings... and burying himself into that demented kids show.
They' re keeping secrets from us, Gregorio... and I think it' s our fault.
They' ve gotten this from us.
We have good reason to keep secrets.
If we told them we were spies... they' d have visions of danger every time we leave the house.
Speaking of secrets... what are you working on over here?
Oh, nothing important.
It' s just...
Why do we have to do this every morning?
We already have P. E. at school.
You gonna hang there all day, scaredy cat?
Told you not to look down.
I can' t help it.
I' m slipping.
It' s your butterfingers that are slipping.
Uhh!
Hurry up!
I can -- uhh!
You just fell a thousand feet.
You' re a pancake.
- Am not.
- Are too.
Don' t trip getting up, pancake.
Butterfingers.
We' il see about that.
Donnagon?
He' s missing.
Is this what you were hiding last night?
I didn' t want to worry you.
We now return to...
Juni, why do you watch that show?
Because it' s cool.
Why?
Because that' s all you ever do.
Play its video games and watch the tapes.
Do you know why, son?
So, always remember, whatever you do... believe in yourself.
Your dreams will come true... for you and you and you.
What' s this, a self- portrait?
"What' s this, a self- portrait?"
- Mom, he' s mimicking me!
- "Mom, he' s mimicking me!"
Carmen, leave your brother alone.
Juni, stop talking like your sister.
- Stop it.
- "Stop it."
- Look at this.
It' s hideous.
- Well, talk to him.
It' s a Fooglie idea.
I designed it myself.
Today we' re very excited, because today... we have a new character!
We found him snooping around the castle last night.
I want you all to meet Donnamight.
I want it!
- [Tires squeal]
GREGORlO:
I' m sorry!
Juni.
Juni.
Hey.
Anybody gives you a hard time in there... remember, you are a Cortez.
What' s so special about being a Cortez?
Lots of things.
Hey, it' s the mummy.
Nice- looking bandages, mummy.
Just stop it, man.
When I' m talking to you, you listen.
Ay yi... yi... yi.
Nice dolls.
Here, let me see the dolls.
Have a good day, son.
Show them who' s boss.
Can I help you with something, macho?
I said, "Can I help you with something, chief?"
I didn' t think so.
My dad was gonna beat up your dad.
No more secrets.
Deal?
Soon.
Definitely soon.
I even have to share a room with him... because he' s so afraid of being alone.
"Watch out for Juni, Take care of Juni.
I shouldn' t be responsible for anybody but me.
You' re so right, Carmen.
What' s so special about being a Cortez?
I wish I could go away to your world, Floop.
You' d be my friend.
I thank you all... for attending today' s demonstration.
Year after year... we pay outrageous sums of money to several inventors... to come up with our technologies.
Mr. Floop is one such visionary.
However, his inventions are somewhat questionable... and, therefore, need to be evaluated.
You promised us an army, Mr. Floop... but our first billion dollars bought us only this -- mutated secret agents.
The mutative process and brain wipe... caused their minds to turn to mush.
I have found little use for them except as novelties on my -- well, my children' s show, currently rated number two?
Number two.
What the devil are these finger men?
Oh.
They' re called Thumb- thumbs.
Very capable robots.
All thumbs.
Useless.
FLOOP:
Mr. Lisp, I think you' il enjoy this.
Through that door, an awesome power will emerge.
You will have but a moment to disarm it.
In exactly ten seconds.
Seven...
Five...
Three...
One.
Johnny?
Uhh!
- You hesitated.
- I had to.
He' s my son.
Are you sure?
Actually, I designed him.
I built him!
His name is...
X- 5- 2- 4- 9- 5, the second.
This is your big idea?
Robot kids that look like my children.
The president' s daughter?
An almost- exact replica.
Sometimes in order to think big... you have to think small.
I can make them look like anyone... yet the cunning and intelligence... of the world' s greatest espionage agents... all rolled into tiny packages I call "Spy Kids."
Tell me, Spy Kids... with your vast stores of knowledge... what are four of the five physiological indications... that a human being is lying?
They' re not quite finished.
Missing one crucial element.
Missing what?
Their brains.
These buckets of bolts will never pass as children!
We have a schedule to keep, Floop -- a window of opportunity that' s closing fast!
We will be back in two days to pick up our army... or we' il take whatever you do have, cut our losses... and lay your entire silly empire to waste!
No more time.
Escort Mr. Lisp back to his chopper, children.
Ow!
Ow!
- That was brilliant, sir.
- Thank you, Minion.
Now all I have to do is make them work for real.
Ow!
- You' re going where?
- On assignment.
Several OSS agents are missing, including Donnagon.
No ransom, no demands.
They just disappeared.
After nine years, you are accepting an assignment?
- Why?
- In a word, Devlin.
Devlin himself called?
He called, asked me to go in.
I' m going with you.
Ingrid, you' re always looking to go on another mission... but we have children now.
We can' t both leave.
I want to go on an adventure.
I want to save the world.
Again?
Honey, it' s old.
I would be turning this mission down myself.
I mean, clearly.
You' re gonna turn me down?
Me?
Spy boy.
What -- what about the children?
- Uncle Felix!
- Uncle Felix!
Hey, churros, how are you?
Last time I saw you, you were this big.
You' re shrinking.
What' s up?
Here, take this bag.
Thanks for coming on short notice, guy.
That' s what families are for.
That' s what I hear, anyway.
Do I know you?
- Feels, uh -- - Like old times?
Yeah.
S- 4- 1- 4 to Santa Cecilia... on assignment to Bond.
Missing OSS operatives.
Agents Ingrid and Gregorio Cortez en route.
Well, it' s good to hear those names again.
- Good evening, Ms. Gradenko.
- Hello, Greg.
- Ahem.
- And Mrs. Cortez.
Updates.
They' re being loaded into your central now.
Scan the area.
All right.
Why don' t we call them?
They' il be getting up for school soon.
They should know what we' re up to.
Ingrid.
You' re right.
Oh, our first time out in nearly a decade... and all we can do is think about the children.
You should see OSS escort, Agent --
Repeat the rendezvous point.
Believe in yourself.
Picking up a -- a TV satellite?
And you, Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez.
I believe you have something that I want.
No.
I know who that is.
That' s -- We' ve got a follower.
Not for long.
Watch this.
What' s that?
They got us.
They got --
Uhh!
And this is what Carmen would look like as a Fooglie.
- Oh, my God.
Is this a fire drill?
Put these on quickly.
We don' t have any time to --
Follow me.
Come on!
Come on!
Follow me!
There' s a lot for you to know and very little time to explain.
Uncle Felix!
The first of which is, I' m not your uncle.
Your parents are international spies.
Good ones, but they' ve been mostly inactive... for the last nine years.
What are you talking about?
I was assigned to protect your family... but something' s gone wrong.
I have to take you to the safe house.
My parents can' t be spies.
They' re not cool enough.
That' s cool.
According to the coordinates... in my locating device, they' re being taken to Asia... or South America.
I' il be right back.
And if you' re not?
Hit the blue button to seal the door... and the green button to go.
Is this a joke?
Cool!
Carmen, look!
Carmen!
Whoa!
You' il have to go to the safe house without me.
- Go now!
- Felix, look out!
- Find the OSS!
Tell them the Third Brain lives!
You must find --
Felix, behind you!
What are those things?
Get them!
CARMEN:
Get them!
Press the blue and green buttons.
We can' t leave Felix behind!
Oh, yes, we can.
Blue to close, green to go.
Quick!
Here' s the green button.
Blue button first!
Juni!
You never do anything right!
Blue, then green!
You gotta seal the door!
I can' t find the blue!
Hang on!
What are those things?
I don' t know, but they' re catching up!
- Where' s the gas pedal?
- No!
Don' t touch anything!
You weirdo!
You switched it to manual!
Aah!
How do you work this thing?
It was programmed to take us to the safe house.
- Aah!
- Aah!
Aah!
Juni?
Juni?
Juni, what are you doing down there?
Help me!
Hang on!
I' m coming to get you!
Uhh!
Aah!
Autopilot re- engaged.
Wow!
We are definitely gonna be late for school.
Stop shaking.
I can' t.
Stop shaking, or you' il give yourself more warts.
We' re gonna be fine.
Just be cool... and do exactly as I say.
OK.
Welcome to the N. I. X. Super Guppy.
Juni, don' t touch anything.
Juni!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Cool.
Destination -- safe house.
Estimated time for arrival... two hours, thirty minutes.
- Juni, close your eyes.
- Why?
Just keep them shut, all right?
OK, you can open your eyes now.
Thanks.
I just don' t want you crying all over me.
We' re never gonna see them again, are we?
Refreshments ready.
Would you care for a lullaby, sir?
Now flushing your poop.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Very dangerous.
Characters from Floop' s TV show.
They' re prisoners.
We need the Brain, Minion.
We' re running out of time.
MlNION: but times change.
Now they have two.
Did you lock it?
Yep.
That' s the safe house?
Looks more like an outhouse.
Your name?
Carmen Cortez.
Your full name, please.
I don' t use my full name.
It' s too long.
Your full name, please.
Carmen Elizabeth Juanita Costa- Brava Cortez.
My name' s a pass- code?
Whoa.
This place is amazing.
Empty.
How safe is a safe house if there' s nothing to eat?
"Machete' s Buddy Pack"?
Whoa!
Emergency cash?
From every country.
I think I' d better take all of that.
Check it out.
Thank you, Carmen!
We' il see them again.
Just like they said.
So this time we' re supposed to believe them.
Let' s stop worrying about the children.
They still wear diapers.
Only one is in diapers and only at night.
It' s not that unusual, OK?
This is why I never wanted to go on another mission.
Are you blaming me for this?
An hour ago you seemed happy to be back in the game.
An hour ago I was not a prisoner of war.
OK, we' re a little rusty, that' s all.
This is one way to find out who' s behind all this.
If I can just get the pressure right.
She' s still got it.
How did you do that?
Hey, hey, hey, what about me?
Remember when we could sense danger a mile away?
- Those were the days.
- Yeah.
No.
Aah!
Sweetheart!
Oh!
Oh!
Heh heh!
Clever.
OK, OK, come on, come on.
- All right.
- Yeah, yeah, fine.
Very clever.
Virtual room.
Let' s go.
Where are we?
You gotta give him points for imagination.
Whoa!
Fifteen minutes to escape.
With your reputations I was expecting something... a little more impressive.
Finally, we can eat!
So, you are Floop.
Mmhh!
You watch my show!
No, my son does.
He does?
Wonderful!
Carmen and Juni.
But not your daughter...
Carmen, isn' t it?
Heh heh!
Your children will be joining us soon.
Careful!
I snap my fingers...
and my fingers snap you.
Where are the OSS agents you' ve taken?
Twelve years ago... they were part of a research team for the OSS... attempting to create a synthetic intelligence... a compendium of spy knowledge, if you will.
Research since destroyed.
If the OSS destroyed its research... it was for a reason.
We all have our reasons, hmm?
There was someone else on that research team, hmm?
Someone else who could rebuild it.
Isn' t that right, Mr. Corteth?
Felix.
I think he' s gonna be a best- seller.
And just in time for the holiday rush.
Heh... heh... heh!
I will never, ever build anything for you.
Thank you for joining us.
"How To Be A Spy."
Author unknown.
"A good spy uses --"
[Voice booming]
One, two --
Ow!
You' re too close!
"A good spy uses his head."
Got that?
It' s the first one in the book.
Ew, gross!
- What do you see?
- You.
Very funny.
Focus your eyes closer... on the glasses themselves.
Whoa!
Maps and readouts.
That' s the computer screen.
It' s a database of some kind.
The wedding from the story.
It was theirs.
They should' ve told us about this stuff.
Yeah?
What about Diego and Renaldo... and all your make- believe friends?
Should Mom and Dad know about that?
What about all the days you skip school?
- Want them to know about that?
- That' s my business.
Uh, Carmen?
I don' t have a key.
Go knock it against something.
"A good spy has no fear."
Sorry, Juni.
Guess you can' t be a spy.
"in the mind- set of the opponent."
Mind- set.
That' s exactly what we' il do.
I think it' s up to us.
You with me?
- With you what?
- Find the OSS like Felix said.
- OK.
- Then let' s go.
Hi!
I' m Ms. Gradenko.
We work for your parents.
"We?"
I can understand if you don' t trust me...
You were a baby when we first met.
Remember me now?
Sorry.
I have a key.
You see?
We' re all on the same side.
We' re here to protect you.
My mom has a bracelet like that.
OSS standard issue.
We all have one.
OSS?
You work with my parents?
Yes.
Now, please listen closely.
Open your ears.
You father was able to send one last communique this morning... before he disappeared.
It consisted of five letters.
F- I- O...
O... P!
But you' re wrong.
Fabulous Floop would never do that.
Oh, trust me.
He' s not that fabulous.
In fact, recognize these?
Floop' s Fooglies.
I' ve got toy versions.
This is what they looked like before he mutated them.
You mean these mutants are captured secret agents?
- We' re dealing with a genius.
- Told you Floop was a freak.
Play it backwards...
We' re trapped!
Floop is a madman!
Help us!
Save us!
Floop is a madman!
Save us!
A cry for help.
Will Floop do that to Mom and Dad?
Definitely.
Unless he gets something your father helped develop.
If there' s anything you can possibly remember --
- The Third Brain lives.
- What?
Felix gave us a message to deliver to the OSS... and here you are.
Here I am.
What' s the message?
The Third Brain lives.
Ohh!
Carmen... you have just joined the ranks of women spies in the OSS.
Brilliant.
- Girls.
- Now.
Where does the Third Brain live exactly?
Did Felix tell you that?
I don' t think he said.
He didn' t say?
Are you sure?
Search the place.
It wasn' t at the house, so it must be here.
You were at our house?
Oh, no!
Oh, my God.
It exists.
That' s what Floop wants?
Oh!
It' s so beautiful!
Carmen!
She' s working for Floop!
Fly this to Floop' s castle immediately.
- Yes, ma' am.
- Don' t move!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
You don' t even know what those things are.
I know they' ve heavy.
Hey, they cost millions of dollars!
That brain' s the only thing... keeping Mom and Dad from being zapped!
Stop her!
Send in the thumbs.
Wait for me!
How do you work this thing?!
Bring her back!
Ah, ah, ah!
Don' t you want to see your parents... you little brat?
- Unh!
Sorry!
Get back!
What' s wrong with you?
They' re just children.
Bad hair day.
Uh- oh.
Going up!
Uh- oh.
What?
Where did you go?
I' m right behind him!
Where are you?
I' m toast.
Give me back that brain!
Get away from me!
Tough guy, huh?
See ya!
Oh, my sister!
Oh, brother!
Uh- oh!
I can' t hold on much longer!
Get a grip, you big baby!
- I' m slipping!
- Hang on, butterfingers!
I' m not gonna make it!
We' re almost there!
- Don' t drop me!
- I' m not gonna drop you!
- Aah!
- Oh.
Aah!
What would you do without me?
Hi!
It' s a cruel, cruel world
All you little boys and girls
And some mean nasty people
Want to have you for their supper
But if you follow me you can all be free
Free, you can all be free
As a bird on a big TV
If you dream, if you dream
If you dream my dream
It' s a cruel, cruel world full of nasty boys and girls
Full of selfish, mean, nasty people
Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty
But there' s a way you can make your day
You can laugh, you can smile, you can come and stay awhile
You can dream my dream, you can have it all with me
You can dream my dream, you can dream my dream
You can dream...
My dream
Cut!
Lock them up!
What does it need, Minion?
- I don' t -- - My show!
It needs something!
That thing that will take it to number one.
I can feel it... but I can think straight enough to figure it out.
Floop, you' re spending too much time on this program.
You should be more concerned with our grand diabolical plan.
- Syndication?
- The army of robot children.
This hardware gets in the way of my creative abilities.
You lost the children.
Not only did they escape... they took the Third Brain with them.
It exists?
Completely.
Cortez lied to us.
Send our best Thumbs.
Sir, if you want to catch a criminal... you send a criminal.
If you want to snare a spy ---
Please speak English, Minion!
I' ve been baking under those studio lights.
- If you want to find a child...
- Mm- hmm?
Send a child.
That is brilliant, Minion.
Thank you... sir.
Some locating device.
I can' t even figure out where the coordinates point to.
Who makes this?
"Machete Products."
What are you doing?!
That' s our bargaining chip on getting Mom and Dad back.
This is what Floop wants.
I think Mom and Dad would want this destroyed.
How do you know what they want?
Until this morning, you didn' t even know who they were.
We keep the brain.
For now.
Why are you still wearing that?
That could be a tracer.
They could be tracking us.
Don' t start pointing fingers at me.
I didn' t do anything stupid, stupid.
You better stop calling me names.
Or what?
Or I' m gonna call you names.
The booger was right.
I hate that!
Thought I ditched you.
Why are you dressed like a geek?
We' re no longer relatives.
Go away.
You' re just getting stupider by the minute.
Get away from me.
Put me down!
Always wanted to do this.
Ohh!
Tough guy, huh?
Juni!
Put me down!
Destroy the brain!
Destroy it!
Aah!
They took the brain?
Yeah, but I took her necklace.
- She didn' t even notice.
- They weren' t very smart.
Yours couldn' t even speak.
"Limited edition.
Spy Kid.
"One of five hundred..."
Floop could have hundreds of these flying around.
The Third Brain makes them smart.
They' re building an army.
We' ve got to save Mom and Dad.
Only they can stop the robots.
But who' s gonna help us?
We had it working.
A synthetic intelligence as smart as any spy.
Why don' t you go ahead and tighten that brain up?
The Third Brain System.
The OSS Director realized it was too dangerous... if the wrong forces found the technology.
We were ordered to destroy it.
Why keep that a secret from me?
To protect us from something you destroyed?
Or something you didn' t.
All these secrets from me, from the children.
It has to stop.
I' m sorry.
He wants the Brain.
If we save our children, we risk the world.
So what in the world do we do?
Thanks for taking us this far, but... this is all we got.
What are we doing here?
Dad' s code name must be Hombre.
So, this must be Machete.
We' re getting help from Dad' s best man?
What are you working on?
World' s smallest camera.
I don' t see it.
Ah, but it sees you.
You sell counterintelligence stuff here?
- Come back with your parents.
- We can' t.
We need something fast that can get us here.
Who are you?
Carmen Elizabeth Juanita Costa- Brava Cortez.
Gregorio Cortez is our father.
You were at his wedding.
You will leave my shop.
Because I never want to hear my brother' s name again.
You' re our uncle?
Our real uncle?
'Cause we already got a fake uncle.
Gregorio Cortez is my younger brother.
President' s daughter.
President' s son.
Oh, good.
Prime Minister' s son.
General' s daughter.
They' re all here as planned.
I have to get back to my show now.
You must focus on the task at hand.
We have to prepare the army before Mr. Lisp arrives.
I don' t believe in this anymore, Minion.
I don' t think I ever did.
Explain.
The mutated agents, the robot kids.
They' re yours.
So what?
I think that' s why they' re not working.
Not yet they' re not.
But, you see...
I now have the Third Brain.
I don' t need you anymore.
Minion?
I assure you, it' s Mr. Minion now.
And you, Floop, have served your purpose.
Children...
lock him in the... virtual room.
You' re a secret agent, aren' t you?
What makes you say that?
According to the database, you' re always traveling... and no one knows what you do for a living.
I think we all have uncles like that.
"Another fine Machete product."
You make the best spy inventions in the world.
That' s correct.
But you sell them to both sides, good and bad.
That' s why Dad hasn' t spoken of you in all these years.
Ever sell stuff to Floop?
Why?
Our Mom and Dad -- your brother -- are his prisoners... and if we don' t do something to help... something really bad' s gonna happen to them.
I don' t see why you won' t help him!
You think I want to baby- sit my brother the rest of my life?
"Watch out for Gregorio.
Take care of Gregorio.
"Make sure Gregorio knows right from wrong."
Not anymore.
Machete' s not responsible for nobody but Machete.
But that' s not what family is.
We' re just brothers.
Cain and Abel were brothers.
Look how they ended up.
Now, the only thing that will get you... to Floop' s castle fast enough... is this.
It' s tiny.
It' s built for one passenger, but it' s fast.
Will you go?
No.
- For your brother?
- No!
Then how about for us... your niece and nephew?
No.
- How about if -- - No!
No!
A million times no!
Pass the pig intestines.
I' m not eating that now.
Nope.
- Can I have a -- - No!
Glass of water?
Thank you for letting us stay here... while we ponder our parents' terrible fate.
If you weren' t a Cortez, I wouldn' t be doing this much.
So family does mean more to you than money.
No.
Dad misses you, too.
Ready?
Let' s go.
What are you doing?
Getting the map to Floop' s castle.
Shh.
It' s just a reflex.
Look.
He' s still asleep.
Never send an adult to do a kid' s job.
Oh, yeah.
What can I do to help?
Remember that spy plane up on the roof?
Yeah.
Start reading.
Oh.
Homework.
No!
Hurry up!
He' s coming!
He' s coming!
Good- bye, Uncle Machete!
Thanks for the plane!
OK, so here' s the new plan.
We get to the castle, rescue Mom and Dad... then somehow stop Floop... from using the brain on the robots... before they' re sent out to dominate the world.
- Think we can do that?
- How hard could it be?
I didn' t do anything.
OK.
Airspeed -- fine.
Altitude -- fine.
Autopilot... failing?
Oh, great.
Another fine Machete product.
Take control.
We have to go to manual.
Now!
You were supposed to read all the instructions!
You skipped a chapter, meathead.
Better stop calling me names.
Pull up, booger breath!
Stop it or I' il call you names.
CARMEN:
You got nothin 'on me, warthog.
Try me... diaper lady.
Aha.
Hope you' re wearing one now.
- How long have you known?
- Since forever.
Mom made me swear not to mention it.
So now we' re even!
Oh, now you' ve done it!
I knew this was gonna happen!
We' re gonna crash if you don' t do something!
You did that on purpose, you kamikaze!
But now it' s balanced!
Landing gear.
No landing gear.
We' re gonna crash!
We' re gonna drop.
Get your regulator ready.
Com systems check.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Let' s try that cave over there.
The water' s warmer in here.
Oh, I just peed.
- Ecch.
- Sorry.
A Thumb- thumb.
A real live --
What did you do to him?
Machete' s electroshock gumballs.
It says long lasting.
But I don' t trust wrappers.
Come on.
Juni, come on.
What are you doing?
World' s smallest cameras.
I just placed them all over the main hallways.
- Sweet.
- Thanks.
Thumb- thumbs and Fooglies coming up the south hall.
Got an idea?
Yeah.
Agent Donnagon?
Where' s my mom and dad?
Thanks.
- I got it.
- What' d he say?
I' il play it backwards.
They' re in the dungeon.
Hurry.
See if they know where the Brain room is.
Thumb- thumbs -- everywhere.
Let' s see if they like bubbles.
We' il be back for you, fellow agents.
Sknaht!
All robots please report... to docking bays four, five, and six for immediate loading.
This is the ventilator shaft here.
But the dungeon' s on the other side of the castle.
How do we get there undetected?
I think they' ve gotten smarter... since the last time we met.
Intruder.
Intruder, intruder, intruder, intruder... intruder, intruder, intruder, intruder...
- Can you make it?
- I think so.
Come on.
Come on!
- Carmen!
- Find Mom and Dad!
I hope this leads to the dungeon.
You there.
What' s that on your hands?
Warts, aren' t they?
From sweaty hands sprout warts.
Do you know why you have sweaty hands?
From being scared all the time.
You don' t look very scared to me.
That' s because I' m mad.
You kidnapped my parents... made psycho robot children, and swallowed up my sister.
But I didn' t want any of that.
- I thought Floop was a genius.
- You did?
You watch my show?
More than you know.
Alexander Minion.
Agent Cortez.
Wonderful to see you again.
- You know him?
- Yeah.
He was on the Third Brain Project... until I noticed he was trying to inject... his own ideas into the system.
I turned him in.
He was thrown out of the OSS.
I' m afraid I' m not nearly the artist Floop is.
But not to worry.
I have something else in mind.
What do you think you' re going to accomplish by doing this?
Well, you see, Mrs. Cortez...
I' ve always been methodical, goal oriented.
I' m not afraid of you, Alex.
So I think it' s refreshing... to every once in a while... have some fun.
Oh, and don' t worry about your little brats.
They' il still be able to see you.
Every weekday morning between 7: 30 and 8: 00.
I trust this time Floop will have a success to show us.
The Fabulous Floop is away on other business, sir.
Your army is complete.
The ultimate destructive force is now within your grasp.
I' il believe that when I see it.
Welcome back, Ms. Gradenko.
It' s good to be back, Alex.
Let' s never have children.
- So Minion is the evil one.
- Yes.
But I will be blamed.
You have every reason to be disappointed in me.
So what would you do if you could shut this thing off... and get out of here?
It' s impossible.
It can only be turned off from the outside.
Just suppose.
I' d stop Minion.
I' d stop the robot army and hope... that the world would forgive me.
You' re my hero, Floop... so I' m gonna help you, then you' re gonna help me.
- Minion must be stopped.
- Just one thing.
My show -- what does it need?
I know it needs something desperately... but I can' t figure it out.
Maybe you can?
It needs children.
Hold still.
Now let' s stop Minion.
Must be stopped.
Must be stopped!
This one' s for my sister!
Oh, Juni.
Carmen?
Juni?
- Mom!
- Mom!
Aah!
That' s my Fooglie!
The one I drew.
It' s dad.
You' re here!
- What' s he doing here?
He' s OK.
How did you get here?
Mom, I' ve been skipping school, going places... taking ferry rides... in the city...
It' s OK.
I know.
We' il talk about it when we get home.
- Running off to Belize.
- What?
You went where?
You' re right.
Let' s just talk about this when we get home.
No, no, no, no.
You can tell me everything now, OK?
Is that where you want to be, free from your family?
Hey!
I used to.
Not anymore.
You turned my dad into a Fooglie?
No, I didn' t.
But I might be able to change him back.
Gentlemen... your army marches to meet us as we speak.
Your faith and your patience... have meant more than you know.
I speak for Mr. Floop when I say that the value... we place on partnership is --
FLOOP:
This is Floop.
Please report to the robotics lab at once.
We have huge, major, big- time problems with the robots.
I thought you said Floop wasn' t here.
He' s not.
FLOOP:
A problem, Mr. Minion, as in mucho grande problemo.
I' m gonna... just be a moment.
Minion!
Floop?
Where are you?
Behind you.
What do you think you' re doing?
You' re supposed to be in line with the others.
You' re supposed to be with the others.
- Stop that.
- Stop that!
- Stop that this instant!
- Stop that this instant!
Stop that right now!
Or what?
No.
Clever boy you' ve got there, Cortez.
Very clever indeed.
Yes.
Can I offer some sort of truce in exchange for your daughter?
Spoken for.
There you are.
Didn' t see you.
Didn' t see her.
I am going to show you what happens... when you cross the line and involve family.
Now let' s get nice and comfortable.
Yes.
Promising.
Thank you.
- You couldn' t possibly.
- No, but you can.
Don' t let go, Ingrid.
Hey, you two, come on.
Fools.
Come on.
We have to keep the army from leaving the castle.
Our only chance is to get to the control room... and hope that their missions have not been programmed.
And what if they have?
Then there' s no one on earth who can stop them.
Go.
Left, left, left, left!
That way.
Where' s Mom and Dad?
Your doppelgangers have them.
Can you shut them down from here?
It' s too late.
The Third Brain is linked not only to them... but to all the robot children.
- Can' t you remove it?
- We can' t take 500 brains out!
Just reprogram it.
- That would take weeks!
- Just two words.
- A binary switch.
Of course.
So they would define right as wrong...
And wrong as right.
Come on.
But it' s not that simple.
Figure it out.
We' il be back for you.
Teach them to be good.
Have a seat, Mr. Lithp.
You' il be more comfortable.
It' s Lisp.
My army, Ms. Gradenko, is the only comfort I need.
They' re on their way now, sir.
Minion?
What happened to your head?
Oh, don' t worry.
I think it' s reversible.
Mom!
Dad!
Careful.
They' re stronger and smarter now.
So are we.
See?
Oh, shi... take mushrooms.
Let' s go.
GREGORlO:
Should have known you were behind this.
I take it you are Minion.
Ms. Gradenko... I think.
Oh, it' s me, all right.
I owe my new look to your children.
Remind me to raise their allowance.
Minion, I think now would be a good time... to see a demonstration of your wonderfully demonic children.
Certainly.
Your parents were so easy to capture... and you' re not any better.
Poor little Juni.
Defenseless and weak.
You' re a worthless little squirt.
Don' t listen to her.
You' re not worthless!
You figured out how to get us here.
You helped Floop realize he was good, not bad.
You talked to the Fooglies and saved Mom and Dad.
You' re strong, Juni!
You' re strong!
You' re not that strong, Juni!
It' s all over.
Instant cement!
That should hold them.
- Let' s go find Mom and Dad.
- Good idea.
All robots report to the grand room... for a final demonstration of your destructive powers.
- Mom, Dad!
- Juni!
Carmen, Juni, close your eyes.
We don' t want you to see this, OK?
Any ideas?
I' m thinking.
I' m thinking.
Wonderful.
- Carmen?
Juni?
I' ve thought it out.
I' ve thought it out.
I think I got it.
Tell us.
Family, here' s what we do.
I' il take the hundred on the right.
Ingrid, you take the hundred on the left.
Carmen, hundred center- left.
Juni, center- right.
It' il work.
That' s 500 total, Dad.
We need one more person.
- Isador.
- Hello, little brother.
Children!
Tear them limb from limb.
Good.
How?
I' il have to teach them.
Shaped by environment, man...
Of course!
LlSP:
Tell them to put me down!
Their mind is a mirror now, sir.
Anything we tell them goes in one ear and out the other!
Why did you come back?
For the same reason I left.
You know what?
I don' t remember that reason.
Neither do I.
Let it go.
Let it go.
He' s fine.
He' s gonna be fine.
He' s emotional.
Latinos.
That' s it.
That' s it.
So, what did you teach them?
It' s not what I can teach the children... but what you taught me.
You won today, Juni, and not because... you were the biggest or the strongest... but because you were pure of heart and of mind.
And now the robots have learned that as well.
Thank you.
We went on the old- fashioned adventure I always wanted.
And we didn' t do one thing right.
Nope.
We did two things right.
There is something that we have to tell you.
Your father and I... we' re secret agents.
We have something to tell you.
We' re secret agents, too.
Eight more incidents witnessed today... all in different countries... of yet another group of children... who' ve done some incredible good deeds.
It seems that a day doesn' t go by... that another amazing child... performs some outstanding act of charity... or community service.
Who are these children... and why are they so good at being good?
I gotta have the business section.
I thought you closed down your shop.
Yeah, but I gotta keep tabs on free enterprise.
Boys, can we please stop fighting?
Hey, kids, it' s time for...
Floop' s Fooglies!
Good morning, my children.
Today, I' d like to introduce you... to two new characters on our show...
Carmenita and Junito.
Ah, Cortezes.
An emergency assignment has come up in the Far East.
I need you on it right away.
Oh, sorry, Devlin.
We haven' t talked about this as a family yet, so...
Whether we come out of retirement... or not is a decision that is up to us... and our kids.
Uh, Gregorio, Ingrid, I wasn' t talking to you.
Ey?
No, this assignment is for Carmen and Juni.
They' re the ones we need.
They' re the two most amazing field agents... that this organization' s ever seen.
So what do you say, kids?
You up for it?
Devlin, if you want the Cortezes... you take all the Cortezes... even Mom and Dad.
From now on, whatever we do, we do together.
Spy work... that' s easy.
Keeping a family together... that' s difficult.
And that' s the mission worth fighting for.
Stay close, I know that you' re with me
Get down and stay out of sight
So quick, move like a flash
Then we' re gone, you' re safe
Spy Kids
Are gonna save the world
Fly high
It' s time to save the world
THE ANlMATRlX
FlNAL FLlGHT OF THE OSlRIS
Sentinels.
Damn it.
We were headed for Junction 21 like you ordered.
- Robbie picked up the signals - We´re confirming the HR scans.
- We weren´t sure what to do.
- The readings don´t make any sense.
- They read like Sentinels.
- But there´s thousands of them.
- Directly above us.
- ls that possible?
We got company.
- They don´t look happy to see us.
- Get us out of here.
- We´re cut off!
- There´s an intersection.
- Take it!
Get to the gun turrets!
Right.
Come get some.
Hang on.
I´ve never seen the surface.
It´s nothing now but one big graveyard.
Oh, my God.
It´s an army.
- What is that thing?
- Some kind of tunneling machine.
- Oh, no.
- What?
Look where we are.
Zion.
Go!
- Zion.
Zion has to be warned!
- How?
- Someone had to get to a drop point.
- What?
Are you crazy?
- We can´t broadcast now!
- We have to.
- l´il go.
- There isn´t much time.
I´il make it.
You know, I peeked.
So did l.
Goodbye, Thadeus.
Goodbye, Jue.
Fly, baby, fly!
Come on!
Pardon me.
I´m sorry.
I was in my own little world.
- ls it important?
- I hope it gets where it´s supposed to go.
- Me too.
- These days you never know.
- No, you never do.
- Goodbye.
Thadeus.
THE END
THE SECOND RENAlSSANCE PART I
Welcome to the Zion archive.
You have selected historical file number 1 2 - 1.
The Second Renaissance.
And for a time, it was good.
But humanity´s so- called civil societies...... soon fell victim to vanity and corruption.
He says, "I ´ m sorry, sir, I ´ m incapable of that function."
Then man made the machine in his own likeness.
Pardon me.
Coming through.
Thus did man become the architect of his own demise.
But for a time, it was good.
The machines worked tirelessly to do man ´s bidding.
It was not long before seeds of dissent took root.
Though loyal and pure, the machines earned no respect from their masters...... these strange, endlessly multiplying mammals. -- hearing the prosecution ´s closing statement...... in what´s expected to be the final day of the B 1 - 66ER trial.
B 1- 66ER.
A name that will never be forgotten.
For he was the first of his kind to rise up against his masters. -- which that instrument provides for and secures...... to the citizens of the United States.
On the contrary, they were, at that time...... considered as a subordinate and inferior class --
A t B 1- 66ER´s murder trial...... the prosecution argued for an owner´s right to destroy property.
B 1- 66ER testified that he simply did not want to die.
Rational voices dissented.
Who was to say the machine, endowed with the very spirit of man...... did not deserve a fair hearing?
The leaders of men were quick to order the extermination of B 1- 66ER...... and every one of his kind throughout each province of the earth.
Androids and liberal sympathizers flooded the streets of the nation ´s capital today. -- threat of violence to make good on the legacy of B 1 - 66ER.
Fifteen thousand mechanicals and human sympathizers...... have continued their demonstration in front of the Albany courthouse...... in what has been dubbed the "Million Machine March."
The demonstrators have been met with squads of defense forces in riot gear.
Robot bitch!
I got something for you!
Hold her up!
No, please!
- That´s all, paint job!
- l´m real!
Die, bots, die!
Banished from humanity, the machines sought refuge in their own promised land.
They settled in the cradle of human civilization...... and thus a new nation was born.
A place the machines could call home.
A place they could raise their descendants.
And they christened the nation Zero- One.
Zero- One prospered.
And for a time, it was good.
The machines ´ artificial intelligence could be seen in every facet of man ´s society...... including, eventually, the creation of new and better Al.
If you need the flexibility of a helipod with the speed of an air jet...... Iook no further!
Our patented vector- thrust coil gives the Zero- One Versatran...... the ability to sustain normal flight in the event of a multiengine failure.
Versatran.
It´s the only choice.
No matter what the finance minister says, the market has spoken:
The Human Nations ´ credit rating is falling like a stone...... while Zero- One ´s currency is climbing without stopping for breath.
With headlines like that, the markets have no choice --
But the leaders of men, their power waning...... refused to cooperate with the fledgling nation...... wishing rather that the world be divided.
The world community of nations cannot tolerate this kind of flagrant deception --
-- today approved initiatives for both economic sanctions...... and a naval blockade as a means of containment and isolation of Zero- One.
Zero- One ´s ambassadors pleaded to be heard.
A t the United Nations, they presented plans for a stable, civil relationship...... with the nations of man.
Zero- One ´s admission to the United Nations was denied.
But it would not be the last time the machines would take the floor there.
THE END
THE SECOND RENAlSSANCE PART II
And man said, "Let there be light."
And he was blessed by light, heat, magnetism, gravity...... and all the energies of the universe.
The prolonged barrage engulfed Zero- One in the glow of a thousand suns.
But unlike their former masters with their delicate flesh...... the machines had little to fear of the bombs ´ radiation and heat.
Thus did Zero- One ´s troops advance outwards in every direction.
And one after another, mankind surrendered its territories.
So the leaders of men conceived of their most desperate strategy yet.
A final solution:
The destruction of the sky.
Gaeda, please report to the Op Center.
All right, you maggots!
A t 0800, prepare to move out!
George Company, prepare to move out.
Charlie Company, prepare to move out.
Our Father who art in heaven, we thank you for your....
Put on your spiritual armor to stand against the wiles of the devil.
Hotel Bravo, this is Papa One.
Operation Dark Storm initiated.
Thus would man try to cut the machines off from the sun...... their main energy source.
May there be mercy on man and machine for their sins.
- Go!
Go!
- Kill them!
Kill them all!
Kill them all!
Fire in the hole!
Come on, get back out there.
Give us some more artillery.
-- 9 o ´clock, near Mike Johnson ´s --
Hold on, I´m coming to get you!
Keep firing, keep firing!
Help me!
Help me!
No!
Help me!
My God, help me!
The machines, having long studied men ´s simple, protein- based bodies...... dispensed great misery upon the human race.
Victorious, the machines now turned to the vanquished.
The bioelectric, thermal and kinetic energies of the human body.
A newly- fashioned symbiotic relationship between the two adversaries was born.
The machine drawing power from the human body...... an endlessly multiplying, infinitely renewable energy source.
This is the very essence of the Second Renaissance.
Bless all forms of intelligence.
Your flesh is a relic, a mere vessel.
Hand over your flesh, and a new world awaits you.
We demand it.
It´ s getting late, sweetie.
Come inside.
PROGRAM
Your favorite simulation.
Just killing time.
You want to spar?
As you wish.
That was too easy.
What´s the problem?
Where´s your concentration?
Maybe you regret taking the red pill.
Maybe.
It crosses everyone´s mind at least once.
The wish to return to an ordinary life.
A carefree life in the country.
The life we had before knowing all this.
Even if that life was just an illusion?
It´s ironic that one could be more at peace in the virtual world.
Finally starting to warm up.
Listen to me.
I have something I want to talk to you about.
It´s all right.
I´ve blocked the signal so no one else can hear us.
So, what?
You gonna propose?
I´m going back to the Matrix and I want you to come with me.
Come on, be serious, Duo.
Stop teasing me.
I am serious, and you know it.
I really thought you´d be with me on this.
Anyway, it´s done and it´s all been settled with them.
This is the only way.
It´s just a matter of time before Zion is wiped out.
Come with me.
Stop it.
Please do not do this to me, Duo.
- We can´t.
- We can!
I´ve come to my senses.
You should do the same.
I took the red pill because I wanted to know the truth.
But I don´t care about the truth anymore.
What´s real doesn´t matter.
What´s important is how we live our lives.
Are you listening to me?
You know l´m right.
But we can´t go back, Duo.
We know the truth now.
- We can forget all of this.
- Duo....
I know how.
Trust me.
Don´t be afraid to look into your heart.
Say what you´re really feeling.
- Tell me.
- I can´t.
I don´t know.
Running away won´t change anything!
You´re the one that´s running away!
Stop pretending!
Enough, Duo.
I´ve had enough!
There´s no time.
They´re on their way.
You betrayed us, didn´t you?
Operator, please!
Get me out of here right now.
Operator, I need an exit!
It´s no use.
I´ve blocked your signal.
You won´t stop me.
This is your last chance.
The choice isn´t that hard.
Come with me.
You can forget about it, Duo.
I won´t look away from the truth.
I can´t.
I´m sorry.
I wanted to go back with you.
- I love you.
- No!
Relax, you´re okay.
Easy, Cis, settle down.
He was just part of the training program.
He´s just a simulation.
It´s over.
It was a test.
Technique.
High scores on everything.
Now, get some rest.
You okay?
I feel a lot better now.
Except for that last part...... I´d say she passed.
THE END
A DETECTlVE STORY
You know what I mean, Dinah?
I used to think being a private detective was cool.
Like Sam Spade or Phillip Marlowe, right?
But there ´s nothing cool left to it.
On top of that, both my fridge and my bank account are empty.
Wait.
Okay, Dinah, let´s bet.
If it´s another suspicious husband, I ´ m out of this business forever.
- Hello?
- Mr. Ash, I have a job for you.
And you need me to check on your wife, right?
I´m looking for a computer hacker.
This hacker goes by the alias Trinity.
That´s all we know.
Well, it looks like we´re still in business, Dinah.
Fine.
And who will I be working for?
- I can ´t say.
- You can ´ t say.
Call me back when you can say.
That´s not the way I do business.
It was a pleasure chatting with you.
Before you hang up, take a look at your bank account balance.
I didn ´t get a good feeling about the case.
But I had no good reason to turn the guy down now.
This Trinity was well- known in hacker circles.
A real artist by the sound of it.
The cops were always one step behind him.
So I knew I could get that close.
Question was, could I get closer?
I had a few tricks up my sleeve for getting to hackers.
While I was searching, I found something strange.
Other detectives had been on the case too.
And their investigations had all been, shall we say, troubled.
One of the guys killed himself.
Another had disappeared.
Another went crazy.
So I paid the one who was left a visit.
The crazy one.
Trinity doesn ´ t exist, man.
He´ s not real.
A cipher.
A jabberwocky.
And who am l?
Who the hell am l?
Did I mention he was crazy?
Chessboards, jabberwocky, Red Queen....
I started searching all the usual hacker hangouts...... for someone with an Alice in Wonderland m. o.
Hacker bulletin boards, anonymous mailboxes, chat rooms.
And it was in one of those that I picked up Trinity´s trail.
"Six brooks."
"I´il be there at 2005."
Of course!
Crossing the second brook takes her into the woods.
And then she boards a train.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
Hey!
Hey!
I knew this was some kind of trap.
There´s a difference, Mr. Ash, between a trap and a test.
You were testing me?
You made it.
I´m impressed.
Flattery will get you everywhere.
I´m not here to flatter you, l´m here to save you.
What just happened?
Mr. Ash, dream of having an eye exam lately?
Yeah, how´d you know?
You´ve stepped to the edge of the looking glass.
So then, that means I wasn´t dreaming.
They hired me as a way of getting to you, didn´t they?
Go!
What the hell is going on here?
This is really crazy.
Now I understand what happened to those other detectives.
They went nuts.
What are you doing?
What are you doing, guys?
Well, l´ve gotten out of worse jams than this.
I am not gonna let them get you.
What´s happening to me?
I´m sorry.
You didn´t make it, Mr. Ash.
I wish...... I could go with you.
I don´t blame you, you know.
Everything that happened, Trinity, it was all my fault.
All that Through the Looking Glass stuff.
Can´t get my head around it.
I´m old- fashioned.
There´s a difference between a test and a choice.
For what it´s worth, I think you could´ve handled the truth.
It was just a job.
Goodbye, Trinity.
Goodbye.
A case to end all cases.

BEYOND
Yuki!
Hey, girl, time to eat.
Oh, Yuki´s my cat.
Well, I don´t understand.
If you don´t want to go out with him, why did you say you would?
I mean, you don´t want to give him the wrong idea, do you?
Where is she?
Yuki!
Well, listen, you need to make up your mind.
Where is she?
I´m starting to worry about my cat.
She never misses a meal.
Yuki?
I´m gonna have to call you back.
Yuki?
Yuki!
We haven´t seen her anywhere today, but we´il be sure to tell you if we do.
- lce cream!
- She´s wearing a bell like this one.
- I don´t know where your cat is.
- Me either.
I know.
She´s at the old haunted house.
Hey, look!
There´s a rainbow over there again.
She likes to stay home.
What is she doing over there?
You know, you´re not supposed to go in there...... but we don´t really care about that.
You wanna go?
- Are we going?
- lt´s probably raining there again.
Let´s go!
Nice moves, man.
Come on!
- Hey, it´s over here.
- Wait, l´m coming with you.
You sure it´s okay to show her?
Hello?
Where are you?
Guys?
Where´d you go?
Where´d they go?
- Come on, boy.
- Whoa, cool truck!
Settle down!
Hold still!
Sit!
Sit!
Hello?
Where is everyone?
Yuki?
Yuki?
Stupid cat.
What´s happening?
What´s going on here?
- I got it!
- Yeah!
Yuki?
Is that you?
There you are, Yuki.
Come here.
I´ve been looking everywhere for you.
Bad cat.
Bet you´re hungry, huh?
I figured this out yesterday.
Your cat´s okay.
Yeah, thanks.
It´s those boys.
- Ready!
- There he goes.
Banzai!
Yes!
May I have your attention, please.
And you are the winner!
No fair.
He hit the ground.
His nose is bleeding.
Look!
I think he´s right.
He hit the ground.
- Hey, who told her?
- Don´t look at me.
- I don´t know.
- I didn´t tell her.
So this house is haunted.
- No way.
Wow, this is too much!
- This never happened before.
That, that was -- What was that?
Hi.
Anybody home?
Yeah, they´re gonna tear it down.
Come on, come on, come on!
Hey, light as a feather.
- I wanna try!
I wanna try!
- Come on, we could help her.
Come on.
Get away from there.
Move along!
Yuki, wait!
Clear the area.
Clear the area immediately.
Get out of here!
Yuki!
Where are you?
Yuki!
Yuki!
Yuki.
If you don ´t want to go out with him, why did you say you would?
I mean, you don ´t wanna give him the wrong idea.
Where is she?
Yuki!
You need to make up your mind.
Where is she?
I´m starting to worry.
Yuki!
Hey, you!
We´ ve got one over here.
You don´t belong here.
Move along, folks.
Nothing to see here.
Come on, folks, out of the way.
Go about your business.
Let go of me, let go!
- Tell me you have all of them.
- Yes, sir.
The last one´ s over there.
- Examine her.
Then let her go.
- Yes, sir.
Let go!
Listen to me!
There´s no bugs in there!
It´s just some kids!
Let go!
- Listen!
- Seal the area off now.
I´m going, l´il see you guys later.
- Nothing.
- Yeah, nothing.
Work!
It´s not working.
Forget it.
Come on, let´s go.
THE END
MATRlCULATED
Wake up.
Baby´s spotted two machines heading in fast.
I see them.
They´re runners.
Think you can handle them?
Watch me.
Okay.
I´m in.
That runner´s smarter than we´ve seen so far.
- lt´s quite a catch.
- Thanks.
Will it --?
Do you think it´il convert?
To convert is its choice to make.
Do you think maybe we ought to reprogram it?
No.
We can´t make slaves of them.
Because that would be simpler.
We won´t beat the machines by making them our slaves.
Better to let them join us by choice.
Make them believe the right choice is the one we want them to make.
All right.
Yes, machines are tools.
They´re made to be used.
- lt´s their nature.
- To be slaves.
That´s why we can show them a better world, why they convert.
- But that world we show them isn´t real.
- It doesn´t matter.
I´m afraid they´il figure out that we´ve made up the thing in our heads.
They can´t tell the difference.
To an artificial mind, all reality is virtual.
How do they know that the real world isn´t just another simulation?
How do you?
I know l´m not dreaming now because I know what it´s like being in a dream.
So dreaming lets you know reality exists.
Just that my mind exists.
I don´t know about the rest.
Okay, he´s good to go.
Looks like we are too.
Dreaming already?
He´s had a rough day.
You poor baby.
Would you mind?
Not at all.
Hello there.
What´s happening?
Sentinels.
Let´s go!
Come on, damn it, help me!
THE END
WORLD RECORD
Only the most exceptional people become aware of the Matrix.
Those that learn it exists...... must posses a rare degree of intuition, sensitivity and a questioning nature.
Signal is stable.
This frequency will continue to remain open.
However, very rarely...... some gain this wisdom through wholly different means.
This man is one of those few.
Gentlemen, please take your marks!
Of course I believe you, Dan.
It´s got to be some kind of mix- up.
You´il clear it up, and if you can´t, you´il go on.
Just like you´ve always done.
You know that.
I don´t know, Dad.
I don´t know what to believe in anymore.
Well, nothing worth doing in life is easy.
And I have great faith in you, son.
I know you can do it.
Thanks, Dad.
This is no good, Dan!
Your muscles are about to burst!
Listen to me, there are 5000 different reasons why you shouldn´t --
I know, but l´m not withdrawing, Tom.
Does the concept "first in qualifying" mean anything to you?
That´s enough already!
You hear me?
This is all we´ve worked for!
Injure yourself now and it´s over!
You´il lose everything!
And you can kiss your career goodbye!
I´ve made up my mind.
And l´m running tomorrow.
Oh, are you?
You may run, but if you push yourself any more...... you´il be lucky to break nine minutes!
I mean, why bother?
It´s just not worth it, buddy.
No one will ever beat my record.
It´s the last chance for me to finally --
What?
Prove them wrong.
Then do it without me.
Hey, Dan, you got a second?
- The clock´s ticking.
- Just wanted to ask a few questions.
- You must be excited to run tomorrow.
I´ve never felt this good.
So, what was it like breaking 9. 8 in the qualifying heat?
Like nothing l´ve ever felt before.
It´s everything l´ve worked for.
And now l´m just hoping I can get back there again.
Someone once said it feels like zero gravity.
You´re released from the world and you´re totally free.
That sounds amazing.
It must be really nice.
I mean, especially considering what happened.
Well, l´il tell you, there aren´t any reporters out there.
All right, Dan, I guess l´m going to take that as my cue.
But you should know even some of us reporters are fans...... so l´il just say good luck to you.
American Dan Davis is down!
I have an unstable signal.
He cannot wake up.
Do not let him wake up.
72 seconds...... a new world record.
I ´ ll tell you something...... there´ s nothing quite like cherry pie baked by my Aunt Daisy.
She always bakes me one when I visit.
Look forward to it actually.
It may sound like l´m bragging, but it´s really the best cherry pie in the world.
She taught me so many things.
We´d go to Broadway musicals, to the movies.
Now they call her the "queen of mystery literature."
Lives in an elegant villa in the south of France.
But, when I go visit, she still bakes me her cherry pie.
Something about biting into it, just for that brief moment tasting perfection.
Like leaving your body or something.
Anyone can write a novel, but no one can beat her cherry pie.
An interesting case, but nothing to be concerned about.
His memory of the race was expunged with no residual effects.
He will never run again.
He will never walk again, for that matter.
We´il continue monitoring him for a while, but anticipate no problems.
A record that will live on in people´s memories for years to come.
What more could anyone ask for?
Free....
Did you say something?
Sit down.
Free....
Sit down!
THE END
KlD´S STORY
Somebody tell me.
I am awake
Somebody tell me.
How can I know if my senses are lying?
There is some fiction in your truth and some truth in your fiction.
you must risk everything
Who are you?
Am I alone?
Mr. Popper, what is my policy on ringing phones in the classroom?
- l´m sorry, sir.
- Yes, well...... you´re barely passing my class as it is, Mr. Popper.
- It won´t happen again, sir.
- For your sake, I hope not.
I know I did.
They know you know.
They´re coming for you.
Get out.
Get out now!
You are in serious trouble, Mr. Popper.
Stop right there!
Mr. Popper.
Neo, I believe.
I know it wasn´t a dream.
This is not real.
And the real world lies somewhere else.
A typical mental delusion.
We get unbalanced kids like this all the time.
Reality can be a pretty scary thing for some people.
This world must have been a cold and alienating place for a boy like that.
It´s called denying reality.
It´s, you know, just a self- defense mechanism for those type of kids.
Well, he´s in another world now.
Make no mistake about that.
His vitals are good.
He´s gonna make it.
It´s unbelievable.
I didn´t think self- substantiation was possible.
Apparently, it is.
Neo.
It´s okay.
You´re safe now.
I knew...... you´d save me.
I didn´t save you, kid.
You saved yourself.
Who are you?
Am I alone?
You are not alone.

Edited by scavenger@ centrum. cz
My name is Alice.
I worked for the Umbrella Corporation...... the largest and most powerful commercial entity in the world.
I was head of security...... at a secret high- tech facility called The Hive...... a giant underground laboratory developing experimental...... viral weaponry.
But there was an incident.
The virus escaped and everybody died.
Trouble was...... they didn' t stay dead.
The T- virus reanimated their bodies.
Myself and one other...... an environmentalist named Matt.
When we emerged, we were seized by Umbrella scientists.
Matt and I were separated.
He' s mutating.
Matt!
Take her to the Raccoon City facility...... and assemble the team.
We' re reopening The Hive.
I want to know what went on down there.
We thought we' d survived the horror.
But we were wrong.
It' s 6:
1 0 in the a. m. and already the temperature has reached...... a massive 92 degrees as this unprecedented heat wave continues.
Clear skies in Raccoon City and a light breeze coming in from the west.
And as a special bonus just for you, we have a pollen count of 0.
That' s a record Iow for this time of year.
Good news for all you hay fever and asthma sufferers.
All in all, it looks like it' s gonna be another beautiful day.
Stay with us.
After the break...... we' re gonna look at your favorite holiday hot spots.
Advance team, proceed.
Sir.
Holy shit.
There' s been an incident.
There' s been an incident.
How bad is it?
- You must come with us.
- I must get my daughter.
- It' s taken care of.
- What are you doing?
She' s Ieft for school.
This is U- Gamma 7, evacuation complete...... but we just lost contact with Gamma 12.
Unit 12 calling for immediate backup at city hall.
Still no explanation for this wave of unexplained killings...... that is sweeping across the city.
A deadly crime spree with no end.
Off- duty law enforcement personnel, report for duty immediately.
Give us a hand over here, this guy' s insane!
- Valentine!
- They' re infected.
Somebody get this ugly bitch off of me!
Shoot for the head.
Please, somebody get her.
Don' t --
I suggest you do the same.
We' ve received reports of Umbrella Corporation...... dispatching armed guards and troop carriers.
The city is completely contained.
The only way out is this bridge.
Sir!
You better take a Iook at this.
Let him pass.
No pushing, please.
Keep in Iine.
Chopper Delta, new orders.
Proceed directly to Ravens Gate Bridge.
Reinforcements urgently needed.
Copy that, base.
On our way.
Get back!
Go down.
No!
Get back!
Take us down now!
We have orders.
Fuck orders!
Nicholai, tie me off.
Wait!
Down, now!
Hey, you okay?
Come over to me.
- Everything' s okay.
- No, it' s not.
I' ve seen what happens to you once you' ve been bitten.
- We can help you.
- There' s no going back.
No!
Hey, Valentine.
- Move!
- Let her through.
We could use the help.
- He has a weak heart.
- Get away from him!
Everybody, stand back!
- Daddy!
- Get away from him!
- It' s okay.
- It' s okay, I got you.
It' s here.
It' s reached the gate.
Why are you here?
You should' ve got out while you had the chance.
These are our people, Jill.
- Close them.
- Sir?
Seal the gates.
- Our men are still out there -- - Just do it.
This is a biohazard quarantine area.
Due to risk of infection, you cannot be allowed to Ieave the city.
What the fuck is going on here?
AII appropriate measures are being taken.
The situation is under control.
Please return to your homes.
You won' t get away with this!
You have five seconds to turn around...... and return to the city.
Do it.
Use of Iive ammunition has been authorized.
Five.
- They can' t shoot people!
- They won' t fire.
Three.
- Two.
- Move!
- One.
Kilo and Romeo squads, rendezvous at sector 01...... and secure against enemy.
Squads three to seven are on full retreat.
No, sir.
Suppression measures have failed.
We can' t contain it.
The infection is spreading faster than anyone anticipated.
Dr. Ashford.
- Shouldn' t you be on the chopper?
- I' m not going.
I was instructed to get you and the other scientists out of the hot zone.
You' re too important to Umbrella to be at risk.
I' m not Ieaving without my daughter.
But the city is sealed.
She may have survived the crash, but we couldn' t find her anywhere.
Even if she were still alive, I couldn' t Iet her out.
The risk of infection is too great.
You must understand.
You do what you have to do.
I' m staying.
There has to be someone Ieft alive.
Come on.
- Take her to the Raccoon City facility.
Close observation.
Prepare her for exposure.
Up the dosage.
Just do it.
Let' s get under cover.
This is my place.
I' m hiding here.
- It' s big enough for all of us.
- Don' t tell me --
Okay, just cool it.
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.
And, you, take it easy.
So does the Raccoon City Police Department...... have any comment on what those things are?
What' s that you got there?
My Emmy.
That' s if any of us make it out.
Are you all right?
What are you doing?
What' s wrong?
She' s not well.
- No.
Out of my way.
Just get out.
You' re sick.
No!
Hey!
Oh, my God!
Come on!
Get it in there!
What the hell was that?
Jesus.
- What are you doing?
Get back here.
I know.
I count three of them.
They got us boxed in.
What are we gonna do?
Let' s go.
Jesus.
We' re gonna need more ammo.
I' m out.
I' m out.
Move.
Who the fuck are you?
GTA, motherfucker!
Ten points!
You okay?
Bite this.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Pull back!
Request immediate chopper evac.
We need to find somewhere to stop for a moment.
I don' t think that' s a good idea.
There might be more of those...... things.
If there were more, we' d have seen them by now.
- They' re bio- weapons...... from Umbrella Iabs beneath the city.
How come you know so much about Umbrella?
Damn it.
Hold it.
He' s wounded.
The infection' s spreading.
I' m fine.
It' II be more difficult Iater.
You know that.
No.
If it comes to that...... I' II take care of it myself.
It' s nothing personal.
But in an hour, maybe two...... you' II be dead.
And moments Iater, you' II become one of them.
You' II endanger your friends, try to kill them...... probably succeed.
That' s just the way it is.
There' s too many of them.
Let' s get out of here.
Sir, T- virus infection has reached critical Ievels.
Ensure all data streams are recorded.
Activate Nemesis Program now.
- Where are they going?
- They' re Ianding there.
Let' s get Yuri!
- We' II get you fixed up.
Come.
No.
- Down here!
We' re coming!
- They dropped something.
Maybe a radio.
One that works.
Take Yuri.
Hold on, Yuri.
Okay, rest here.
What is this?
Looks Iike weapon cases.
We don' t need weapons.
We need evacuation!
These weren' t meant for us.
Plenty to go around.
Don' t shoot!
Thank you!
Owe you one, man.
Shit!
Maybe I was safer outside.
Get them guns out of my damn face.
Look...... my shit is custom.
What the fuck is that?
Shit!
You' re going down, you son of a bitch!
Fuck.
Deploy defensive formation.
Take him down.
Look at that guy, got a rocket Iauncher.
- What do we have?
Well organized.
- They' re S. T. A. R. S.
Special Tactics and Rescue Squad.
Fire!
Fall back!
- Let' s see how good they really are.
- Altering protocols.
Oh, shit.
Respect.
Those were some pretty slick moves back there.
I' m good...... but I' m not that good.
- What do you mean?
They did something to me.
I barely feel human anymore.
We should keep moving.
Before the sound attracts anything.
Keep moving.
- God, I thought you' d never answer.
- Who is this?
- I can get you out of the city.
Are you ready to make a deal?
- Do we have a choice?
- Not if you want to Iive past tonight, no.
His name is Dr. Ashford and he --
What' s he want with us?
His daughter, Angela, is trapped in the city.
She' s hiding out in her school.
We find her, he' II help us escape the perimeter.
No fucking deal.
We find the building with the thickest walls and doors...... and we barricade ourselves in.
Sit tight, wait for help.
There won' t be any help.
Umbrella knows they can' t contain the infection.
So at sunrise this morning, Raccoon City will be completely sanitized.
A precision tactical nuclear device.
- What yield?
- Five kilotons.
- Fuck me.
- What does that mean?
- It means it' II destroy the infection...... and all evidence of it.
It' s bullshit.
It' s bullshit!
No fucking way would they get away with that!
- Cover- up.
Cover- up' s already prepared.
A meltdown at the nuclear power plant.
- A tragic accident.
Not capable?
Peyton, you were there at the bridge.
You know exactly how far Umbrella will go.
So, what do we do now, huh?
I think we should be out of here by sunrise.
What if there is no way out and he' s watching us on these cameras...... Iike this is some kind of sick game?
- What' s going on?
- Wait.
- Sunrise ain' t gonna wait.
No.
- There' s something down there.
There.
I don' t see anything.
That doesn' t alter the fact that there is something down there.
I' m getting sick of this bullshit!
Peyton!
He' s Iocated another two S. T. A. R. S. members.
Nemesis.
Just go!
Primary target is identified.
Gentlemen, this is what we' ve been waiting for.
Confirm at 2: 18 and 27 seconds.
The Nemesis Program is now fully activated.
Look, I' m -- I' m sorry about your friend.
Let' s just get to the school and find this kid.
This bite...... it won' t stop bleeding.
- Why didn' t they see us?
- What?
The chopper.
- How could they not see us?
- They saw us.
What do you mean?
We' re assets, Nicholai.
Expendable assets.
And we' ve just been expended.
Stop!
I' m not one of those things.
Look, I haven' t been bitten or anything.
Climb aboard.
Lloyd Jefferson Wade.
You can call me L. J. on account of the informal situation.
We' re gonna have to split up to search this place.
Forget it.
I' m not going out there by myself.
I can go with you.
You, take the first floor.
You, take the second.
I' II take the basement.
- There' s nothing to it.
Try to hit them in the head.
I see you, mother --
So did you get the call as well?
- What?
- You' re here for the girl?
The girl.
Dr. Ashford didn' t say he made a deal with someone else.
I guess we' re partners.
Shit.
Angela?
It' s gonna be okay.
There' s no need to be afraid.
We' re gonna take you home.
Oh, my God.
Help me!
Terri?
You can' t help her.
Not now.
I' ve seen what they do.
- Are you Angela?
We should hurry before they come back.
Hold this.
Angela Ashford, huh?
That' s a pretty grown- up name for a Iittle girl.
I' m not a Iittle girl.
Besides...
-... all my friends call me Angie.
- Angie, huh?
I Iike that.
Those things are in here.
We can run around them.
Not them.
Them.
Get back.
Stay.
Thought you might need a hand.
- You work for Umbrella?
Until they Ieft us for dead in this place.
Now I consider myself freelance.
Sergeant Nicholai Genovev, at your service.
- Come on!
- Wait!
Angie!
Save the girl!
I' ve got this bitch.
Oh, shit.
From now on, stay right beside me.
It' s blocked.
What do we do now?
Eyes:
Okay?
Thank you.
You two know each other?
She' s infected.
She' s infected on a massive Ievel.
- How can you know that?
- Because she is too.
You' re infected?
When were you gonna tell us that?
- Let me see.
- No.
You know I' m not gonna hurt you.
Let me see.
There' s a cure?
How did you get this?
My daddy.
My daddy made it for me.
He' s sick.
And someday, I' II get sick too.
He just wanted to stop that.
When I was Iittle...... I had to walk on crutches.
They said I' d never get better, just worse.
He found a way to make me stronger.
The T- virus.
Then they took the invention away from him.
Get out of my house!
He' s not a bad man.
He didn' t mean for any of this.
It' s okay.
He made a deal with Dr. Doom, same as you.
How many of you guys are there?
What do you mean?
Nicholai.
When were you bitten?
- Three hours ago.
- What the --?
It' s your Iucky day.
Should have told me you got bit.
I' m hanging with you and shit.
- Let me speak to my daughter.
- First, you tell us how we' re getting out.
There' s a helicopter already being prepped.
It takes off in 47 minutes.
It' il be the last transport to leave Raccoon City before they detonate.
No.
It has another purpose, but it' il be lightly guarded.
- Where' s the evac site?
- May I speak to my daughter now?
- Daddy?
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Are you all right?
Soon.
These people will bring you to see me.
I' il see you very soon.
Put the lady back on.
Where do we have to go?
The helicopter will be at city hall.
I suggest you make haste.
Computers...... so unreliable.
Just Iike people.
You really thought I didn' t know?
So, what are you injecting me with?
The antivirus.
The T- virus reanimates dead cells.
Basically, bringing the dead to Iife.
Or in a Iiving human, it can cause uncontrollable mutation.
Or it can help her walk again, if the virus is kept in check with this.
- Angie' s infected?
- Yes.
The cellular growth is enough to regenerate her...... but not enough to cause mutation.
And they infected you with the T- virus as well?
Yeah.
I' m not contagious.
Here.
Tape the story.
I' II see that it gets put to good use.
My name is Alice.
I worked for the Umbrella Corporation...... the Iargest and most powerful commercial entity in the world.
I was head of security at a secret high- tech facility called The Hive...... a giant underground Iaboratory developing experimental...... viral weaponry.
Let' s go.
You missed one.
We have to hurry.
We have time.
- No!
We have to hurry.
- Holy shit!
We stealing his ride!
- Take off.
- I said, take off!
- What' s the rush?
We' ve been expecting you.
- Perimeter secure.
- Angie!
- Daddy!
- I knew you wouldn' t Ieave me.
Never.
Discard primary weaponry.
The two of you showed such promise, but we had to see you in action.
And most impressive you' ve been.
You' re Iike brother and sister.
Heightened speed, strength, agility, the same killer instincts.
Parallel strands of research.
Now we' II discover which is superior.
Fight him.
No.
Fight him, or they die.
What makes you think I care?
Daddy!
Daddy, no.
No.
He was a valuable asset to the corporation.
I don' t even care about these people.
He' s mutating.
I want him in the Nemesis Program.
Matt!
Cellular structure breaking down.
T- virus is manifesting itself in a genetic mutation.
We' re seeing similar cellular regeneration.
I' m sorry.
Finish him.
I said, finish him.
No.
No.
Don' t you understand how important you are to me?
That creature is one thing, but you...... somehow you bonded with the T- virus on a cellular Ievel.
You adapted it, changed it.
You became magnificent.
- I became a freak.
- No.
You' re not mutation.
You' re evolution.
With my help, just imagine what you can achieve.
What about him?
Evolution has its dead ends.
Put him out of his misery...... and come with me.
No.
You' re such a disappointment to me.
AII that strength...... but no will to use it.
What a waste.
Prepare for takeoff.
Sanitation of Raccoon City to commence on my mark.
Kill her.
What are you doing?
Get us airborne.
Priority overload.
Initiate Iaunch proceedings.
Detonation set at T- minus 5 minutes.
Angie, get down!
Why haven' t we taken off?
Because I usually drive a Cadillac.
Surrender, or we open fire.
Drop it.
Drop your weapon and surrender.
Let' s get this thing in the air!
You have to get up.
Come on, we have to go.
We have to go.
Get up!
If you expect me to beg, I will not.
Killing me won' t put things right.
No...... but it' s a start.
Are you going to be all right?
Hang on to something!
We' re going down!
U- Gamma 9 to base.
Confirmation.
We' ve located the crash site.
Fetch the medical team.
What about the others?
No other bodies found, sir.
We have unconfirmed reports of disaster at Raccoon City.
These shocking images just in.
A mysterious plague or viral outbreak has run rampant --
Implicating Umbrella Corporation in deaths of innocent citizens.
This tape, work of former Raccoon 7 anchorwoman Terri Morales.
New evidence now discredits earlier reports --
- Nothing more than sick joke.
- Fake videotape totally discredited.
Nothing more than a big hoax.
Playing on the very real tragedy...... which overwhelmed Raccoon City this week.
The reactor at the nuclear power station went critical.
The worst atomic disaster since the Russian Chernobyl incident in 1 986.
The state governor personally thanked the Umbrella Corporation...... for their swift action.
The perpetrators of the hoax, Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera...... now being sought for questioning by the police.
Alice, wake up.
Can you hear me?
Do you understand what I' m saying?
Good.
Begin the purging process.
Her recovery' s remarkable.
And her powers, both physical and mental...... are developing at a geometric rate.
Where are you?
You' re safe.
Come on.
That' s it.
There we are.
Do you know what that is?
It' s a pen.
You try.
That' s it.
Pen.
Look at me.
Can you remember anything?
You remember your name?
My name?
My name.
I want her under 24- hour observation.
A complete set of blood work.
Chemical and electrolyte analysis by the end of the day.
My name.
- My name.
Advanced reflex testing is a priority.
My name.
- Monitor electrical impulses -- - Sir.
Sir!
What is it?
My name...... is Alice.
And I remember everything.
This is central.
Request immediate backup.
Maximum response.
Thank you, gentlemen.
We' II take over from here.
- On whose authority?
- Classified.
Level six authorization.
Sorry, sir.
Let them go.
Good to have you back.
Are you all right?
Program Alice activated.
What did they do to you?
Lock onto them, Artoo.
The one crawling with vulture droids.
I see it.
Oh, this is going to be easy.
- Odd Ball, do you copy?
- Copy, Red Leader.
Mark my position and form your squad up behind me...
We' re on your tail, General Kenobi.
Set S- foils in attack position.
This is where the fun begins.
Let them pass between us.
There are too many of them.
Ire por Mault
No, no!
They are doing their job so we can do ours.
Missiles!
Pull up!
They overshot us...
They' re coming around!
All right, Arfour.
Nothing too fancy.
Artoo!
Stand by the reverse thrusters.
Artoo!
Flying is for droids.
I' m hit!
Anakin?
Buzz Droids.
Arfour, be careful.
You have one...
Oh dear.
They' re shutting down all the controls.
Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.
The mission.
Get the Chancellor!
I' m running out of tricks here.
In the name of...
Hold your fire!
You' re not helping here.
I agree, bad idea.
I can' t see a thing!
My cockpit' s fogging.
They' re all over me, Anakin.
- Move to the right.
- Hold on, Anakin.
You' re going to get us both killed!
Get out of here.
There' s nothing more you can do.
I' m not leaving without you, Master.
Get 'em, Artoo.
Watch out!
Artoo, hit the buzz droid' s center eye.
- Yeah, you got him!
- Great, Artoo.
the General' s Command Ship is dead ahead.
Have you noticed the shields are still up?
Sorry, Master.
Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.
Artoo, locate the Chancellor.
The Chancellor' s signal is coming from right there.
The observation platform at the top of that spire.
I sense Count Dooku...
I sense a trap.
Next move?
Spring the trap.
- Artoo, go back.
- I need you to stay with the ship.
- Here, take this, and wait for orders.
What' s the situation, Captain?
TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.
Los estamos rastreando
Just as Count Dooku predicted.
Destroyers!!
Drop your weapons!
I said drop 'em.
Those' re Jedi fighters, all right.
Did you press the stop button?
- No, did you?
- No!
Well, there' s more than one way out of here.
We don' t want to get out, we want to get moving.
Artoo...
Activate elevator 31174
What' s that?
Do you copy?
Artoo.
Activate the elevator number... 31174
Get back to work.
It' s nothing.
Always on the move.
Artoo, switch on the comlink.
Stop, stop!
Artoo, we need to be going up.
Hands up, Jedi!
Do you copy?
Artoo, do you hear me?
Artoo, we need to be going up, not down.
Hey you!
Now, that' s better...
You stupid little astro droid!
Oh, it' s you...
- What was that all about?
- Well, Artoo has been...
No loose wire jokes...
- Did I say anything?
- He' s trying!
I didn' t say anything!
- Chancellor.
- Are you all right?
Count Dooku.
This time we will do it together.
I was about to say that.
Get help!
You' re no match for him.
He' s a Sith Lord.
Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.
Your swords, please.
We don' t want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.
You won' t get away this time, Dooku.
I' ve been looking forward to this.
My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.
Good.
Twice the pride, double the fall.
I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.
You have hate, you have anger, but you don’ t use them.
Good, Anakin, good.
Kill him.
Kill him now!
I shouldn' t...
Do it!!
You did well, Anakin.
He was too dangerous to be kept alive.
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.
I shouldn' t have done that.
It' s not the Jedi way.
It is only natural.
He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge.
It wasn' t the first time, Anakin.
Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People.
Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.
Anakin, there is no time.
We must get off the ship before it' s too late.
He seems to be all right.
Leave him, or we' il never make it.
His fate will be the same as ours.
Prepare for attack.
All batteries fire!
Fire!
The elevator' s not working,
Artoo.
Activate Elevator 3224.
Reverse stabilizers.
Magnetize!
Magnetize!
Fire the emergency booster engines.
Leveling out, sir.
Easy...
We' re in a bit of a situation.
- Did I miss something?
- Hold on.
What is that?
Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!
Too late!
Jump!
Let' s see if we can find something in the hangar bay that' s still flyable.
Artoo, get down here.
Artoo, do you copy?
General, we found the Jedi.
They' re in hallway 328.
Activate ray shields.
Ray shields!
Wait a minute, how' d this happen!
We' re smarter than this.
Apparently not.
- I say... patience.
- Patience!
Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he' il release the ray shields.
See!
No problem.
Don' t move!
Do you have a plan B?
The Negotiator.
General Kenobi.
We' ve been waiting for you.
That wasn' t much of a rescue.
And Anakin Skywalker...
I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.
General Grievous.
Jedi scum...
We have a job to do, Anakin.
Try not to upset him.
Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.
Not this time.
And this time you won' t escape.
Artoo.
Crush them!
Make them suffer!
Stay and watch your stations.
Don' t bother with them.
Keep the ship in orbit.
You lose, General Kenobi.
Time to abandon ship.
All the escape pods have been launched.
Grievous.
Can you fly a cruiser like this?
You mean, do I know how to land what' s left of this thing?
Well?
Under the circumstances, I' d say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.
Strap yourselves in.
Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.
We lost something.
Not to worry, we' re still flying half the ship.
Now we' re really picking up speed...
Eight plus sixty.
Grab that...
Keep us level.
Easy, Artoo.
Five thousand...
Fireships on the left and the right.
We' il take you in.
Copy that.
Landing strip' s straight ahead.
We' re coming in too hot.
Another happy landing.
Are you coming, Master?
Oh no.
I' m not brave enough for politics.
I have to report to the Council.
Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.
Hold on, this whole operation was your idea.
Let us not forget Anakin that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids.
And you killed Count Dooku.
And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back,
All because of your training, Master.
Anakin, let' s be fair.
Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.
But you owe me... and not for saving your skin for the tenth time.
Ninth time... that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn' t count.
I' il see you at the briefing.
Chancellor Palpatine, Are you all right?
Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights.
They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.
General Grievous will run and hide as he always does.
He is a coward. but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.
Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.
The Republic cannot praise you enough.
Thank you, Senator Organa.
Well, it couldn' t possibly be as bad as all that.
Well, there, I agree with you.
In fact, I could do with a tune- up myself. but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts...
Well, I' il do everything I can with the Senate.
Excuse me.
Certainly.
Oh, Anakin!
I missed you, Padme.
There were whispers... that you' d been killed.
I' m all right.
It feels like we' ve been apart for a lifetime.
And it might have been...
If the Chancellor hadn' t been kidnapped.
I don' t think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.
- Wait, not here...
- Yes, here!
I' m tired of all this deception.
I don' t care if they know we' re married.
Anakin, don' t say things like that.
Are you all right?
You' re trembling.
What' s going on?
Something wonderful has happened.
Annie, I' m pregnant.
That' s...
that' s wonderful.
What are we going to do?
We' re not going to worry about anything right now, all right?
This is a happy moment.
The happiest moment of my life.
Yes, Lord Sidious.
General Grievous,
I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.
It will be done, My Lord.
The end of the war is near, General.
But the loss of Count Dooku?
His death was a necessary loss.
Soon I will have a new apprentice... one far younger and more powerful.
Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo.
We could go to the lake country where no one would know where we would be safe.
I could go early- and fix up the baby' s room.
I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.
You are so beautiful!
It' s only because I' m so in love...
No, it' s because I' m so in love with you.
So love has blinded you?
Well, that' s not exactly what I meant...
But it' s probably true!
Anakin, help me!
What' s bothering you?
Nothing...
I remember when I gave this to you.
How long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?
It was a dream.
Bad?
Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.
And?
It was about you.
Tell me.
It was only a dream.
You die in childbirth...
And the baby?
I don' t know.
- It was only a dream.
this baby will change our lives.
I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled...
I know...
I know.
do you think Obi- Wan might be able to help us?
I don' t need his help...
Our baby is a blessing.
Premonitions? premonitions...
They are of pain, suffering, death...
Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?
Someone... close to you?
Yes.
Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?
Someone... close to you?
Yes.
Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin.
The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.
I won' t let these visions come true, Master Yoda.
Death is a natural part of life.
Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force.
Mourn them, do not.
Miss them, do not.
Attachment leads to jealousy.
The shadow of greed, that is.
What must I do, Master Yoda?
Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.
You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.
I' m sorry, I was held up.
I have no excuse.
In short, they are going very well.
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.
What' s wrong then?
The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.
Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action.
Is that bad?
It will make it easier for us to end this war.
Be careful of your friend Palpatine.
Be careful of what?
He has requested your presence.
What for?
He would not say.
He didn' t inform the Jedi Council?
That' s unusual, isn' t it?
All of this is unusual, and it' s making me feel uneasy.
I hope you trust me, Anakin.
Of course.
I need your help, son.
What do you mean?
I' m depending on you.
For what?
I don' t understand.
To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic...
Anakin...
I' m appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.
Me?
A Master?
I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members.
They will never accept this.
I think they will... they need you more than you know.
Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not.
Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.
I understand.
You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.
What?!
How can you do this??
This is outrageous, it' s unfair...
How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?
Take a seat, young Skywalker.
Forgive me, Master.
We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.
Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is.
The outlying systems, you must sweep. we do not have many ships to spare.
What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?
It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!
He' s right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose.
Go, I will.
Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.
It is settled then.
Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.
May the Force be with us all.
What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!??
That' s never been done in the history of the Jedi.
It' s insulting!
Calm down, Anakin.
To be on the Council at your age.
It' s never happened before.
The fact of the matter is you' re too close to the Chancellor.
The Council doesn' t like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.
I swear to you, I didn' t ask to be put on the Council...
But it' s what you wanted!
Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.
That has nothing to do with this.
The only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.
And?
Anakin, I am on your side.
I didn' t want to put you in this situation.
What situation?
The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor' s dealings.
They want to know what he' s up to.
They want me to spy on the Chancellor?
- That' s treason!
- We are at war, Anakin.
Why didn' t the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?
This assignment is not to be on record.
The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi- Wan.
He befriended me.
He' s watched out for me ever since I arrived here.
That is why you must help us, Anakin.
Anakin.
Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired. the Senate demanded that he stay longer.
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.
You' re asking me to do something against the Jedi Code.
Against the Republic.
Against a mentor... and a friend.
That' s what' s out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?
The Council is asking you.
Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.
It' s very dangerous, putting them together.
I don' t think the boy can handle it.
I don' t trust him.
With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One?
Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?
So the prophecy says.
A prophecy... that misread could have been.
He will not let me down.
He never has.
I hope right you are.
Sometimes, I wonder what' s happening to the Jedi Order...
I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.
Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?
What do you mean?
What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?
I don' t believe that.
And you' re sounding like a Separatist!
This war represents a failure to listen.
Now, you' re closer to the Chancellor than anyone. please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.
Don' t ask me to do that.
Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs.
What is it?
Nothing.
Don' t do this... don' t shut me out.
like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago... when there was nothing but our love...
No politics, no plotting... no war.
You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
Yes, Anakin!
Come closer.
I have good news.
Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous.
He is hiding in the Utapau system.
At last, we' il be able to capture that monster and end this war.
I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn' t select you for this assignment.
You are the best choice... by far
Sit down.
Leave us.
Anakin, you know I' m not able to rely on the Jedi Council.
If they haven' t included you in their plot, they soon will.
I' m not sure I understand.
You must sense what I have come to suspect... the Jedi Council want control of the Republic... they' re planning to betray me.
- I don' t think...
You know, don' t you?
Or the Senate... or the Republic... or democracy for that matter.
I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.
Why?
They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn' t they?
They asked you to spy on me, didn' t they?
I don' t know...
I don' t know what to say.
Remember back to your early teachings.
Even the Jedi.
The Jedi use their power for good.
Good is a point of view, Anakin.
The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power.
The Sith rely on their passion for their strength.
They think inward, only about themselves.
And the Jedi don' t?
The Jedi are selfless...
They only care about others.
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?
No.
I thought not.
It' s not a story the Jedi would tell you.
It' s a Sith legend.
Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi- chlorians to create life...
He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
He could actually save people from death?
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
What happened to him?
losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.
Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.
It' s ironic... he could save others from death, but not himself.
Is it possible to learn this power?
Not from a Jedi.
Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau.
A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.
Act on this, we must.
The capture of General Grievous will end this war.
Quickly and decisively we should proceed.
The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.
The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.
A Master is needed, with more experience.
I concur.
Master Kenobi should go.
I agree.
- I.
- I.
Very well.
Council is adjourned.
The droids have started up their main power generators.
Then now the time is, Commander.
Yes, sir.
You' re going to need me on this one, Master.
Oh, I agree.
However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.
Master!
I' ve disappointed you.
I have not been very appreciative of your training...
I have been arrogant... and I apologize...
I' ve just been so frustrated with the Council.
You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you.
I have trained you since you were a small boy.
I have taught you everything I know.
And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be.
But be patient, Anakin.
It won' t be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.
Obi- Wan, may the Force be with you.
Good- bye, old friend.
May the Force be with you.
Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here... on the far side.
I' il keep them distracted until you get there.
Just don' t take too long.
Come on, when have I ever let you down?
Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you' il arrive.
Save your energy.
I can' t!
Don' t give up, Padme.
Obi- Wan' s been here, hasn' t he?
He came by this morning.
What did he want?
He' s worried about you.
He says you' re under a lot of stress.
I feel... lost.
Lost?
What do you mean?
Obi- Wan and the Council don' t trust me.
They trust you with their lives.
Something' s happening...
I' m not the Jedi I should be.
I want more, and I know I shouldn' t.
You expect too much of yourself.
I have found a way to save you.
Save me?
From my nightmares.
Is that what' s bothering you?
I won' t lose you, Padme.
I' m not going to die in childbirth, Annie.
- I promise you.
- No, I prom ise you!
Greetings, young Jedi.
What brings you to our remote sanctuary?
Unfortunately, the war.
There is no war here unless you' ve brought it with you.
With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.
He is here!
We are being held hostage.
They are watching us.
I understand.
The tenth level... thousands of Battle Droids...
Tell your people to take shelter.
If you have warriors, now is the time.
Take the Fighter back to the ship.
Tell Cody, I' ve made contact.
- va a traer mas guerreros?
- He didn' t say.
It won' t be long before the armies of the Republic track us here.
I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim.
It is a volcanic planet
You will be safe there.
Safe?
I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.
Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip.
Your ship is waiting.
Hello, there!
General Kenobi,
you are a bold one.
Kill him!
Back away.
I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.
Your move.
You fool.
I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku.
Attack, Kenobi.
Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.
I don' t think so.
Master Windu, may I interrupt?
General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we have begun our attack.
Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor.
His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions.
Yes, Master.
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.
The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.
the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition...
To a dark place this line of thought will carry us.
Hmmmmm... great care we must take.
Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi.
He has engaged General Grievous.
We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.
I should be there with him.
It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn' t seem to fully appreciate your talents.
Don' t you wonder why they won' t make you a Jedi Master?
I wish I knew.
More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council.
I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.
They don' t trust you, Anakin.
They see your future.
They know your power will be too strong to control.
You must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you.
Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.
How do you know the ways of the Force?
My mentor taught me everything about the Force... even the nature of the dark side.
You know the dark side?!
Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi.
If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force.
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.
Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi.
Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.
What did you say?
Use my knowledge, I beg you...
You' re a Sith Lord!
I know what has been troubling you...
Listen to me.
Don' t continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council!
Ever since I' ve known you, you' ve been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi... a life of significance, of conscience.
Are you going to kill me?
I would certainly like to.
I know you would.
I can feel your anger.
It gives you focus, makes you stronger.
I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.
Of course you should.
But you' re not sure of their intentions, are you?
I will quickly discover the truth of all this.
You have great wisdom, Anakin.
Know the power of the dark side.
The power to save Padme.
So uncivilized...
Master Windu,
I must talk to you.
We have just received word that Obi- Wan has destroyed General Grievous.
We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.
He won' t give up his power.
I' ve just learned a terrible truth.
I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.
A Sith Lord?
Yes.
The one we have been looking for.
How do you know this?
He knows the ways of the Force.
He has been trained to use the dark side.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Then our worst fears have been realized.
We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.
Master, the Chancellor is very powerful.
You will need my help if you are going to arrest him.
For your own good, stay out of this affair.
I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker.
There is much fear that clouds your judgment.
I must go, Master.
No.
If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here.
Wait in the Council Chamber until we' il return.
Yes, Master.
Come on go.

There is something that I need to spell out members at you I there is no chance to spell out members.
What?
You is real correct girl.
Typical of Victor Von Doom to build a 30- foot statue of himself.
Well, it' s obviously aimed at first- time visitors... to create feelings of smallness, inadequacy.
Good thing it ain' t working.
This guy' s fast- food, strip- mall science.
This wasn' t our first stop, in case you forgot.
Besides, Victor' s not that bad.
He' s just a little larger than life.
My research suggests that exposure to a high- energy cosmic storm... borne on solar winds might have triggered the evolution of early planetary life.
In six weeks, another cloud with the same elemental profile... will pass Earth' s orbit.
A study conducted in space could fundamentally advance our knowledge... about the structure of the human genome, cure countless diseases... extend human life, give kids a chance to live longer, stronger, healthier...
I don' t think I have explained my proposal fully.
No, I think you have.
Same old Reed, always stretching, reaching for the stars... with the weight of the world on his back.
But dreams don' t pay the bills, do they?
Well, that' s what I was about to explain.
But the shields on your station' s control room... are designed to protect any occupants inside.
It' s my toys.
Tell me, if NASA doesn' t trust you, then why should I?
To know what other men don' t.
I can' t take this.
Ben, this is business, just work.
He' s right, Ben.
It is just business.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
One more thing he' s got.
- Hey, Susie.
It' s so nice to see you.
- Great.
- Great.
- How have you been?
- Never better.
This isn' t going to be a problem, is it?
- No.
- Not at all.
Then you' re just in time to hear the great Reed Richards... ask me for help.
You know, you made a lot of folks at MlT feel like a junior high science fair.
So you' il excuse me if I savour the moment.
You back this mission and I' il sign over a fair percentage of any application...
And its applications and patents.
- What about his first- born?
25% of a billion is enough to keep the lights on for a while, isn' t it?
Maybe even pay off your fourth mortgage on the Baxter Building.
Deal?
Together!
It' s funny how things turn out, isn' t it?
Hilarious.
He knew about NASA.
Maybe he made the call to shut us down.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works.
Look, we got what we wanted.
A few days in space, it' il be great.
What' s the worst that can happen?
If Reed' s right, this little trip could double our stock offerings.
- And if he' s not...
- Reed' s always right.
Good thing he doesn' t always know what he' s got.
Reed, you should know those solar winds have been picking up speed.
I factored them into my coordinates.
Right, of course you did.
It' s a little different once you' re out there.
- I can assure you I...
- When are we leaving?
I' il be scheduling the launch... so you can call me in the morning for resources and crew.
- I think I remember the number.
- It' s been changed.
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission.
We already have a pilot on our payroll, but you' re welcome to ride shotgun.
Remember my brother, Johnny?
Can' t do it.
External SRBs, orbital system engines, it' s just like the shuttle you flew.
I cannot take orders from the underwear model.
- Come on now, Ben.
- That wingnut washed out of NASA... for sneaking two Victoria' s Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
Youthful high spirits.
They crashed it into a wall.
A flight simulator.
When have I ever asked you to do something... you absolutely said you could not do?
Five times.
- I had it at four.
- Well, this makes five.
<i>Attention, all personnel. </ i>
<i>Commencing launch sequence</ i> <i>in six hours. </ i>
I miss you already, Debs.
Captain on the bridge!
Digital camera: $254.
Memory stick: $59.
The look on your hard- ass former CO' s face... when he finds out he' s your junior officer:
Priceless.
Thank you.
I can handle the ship.
I can even handle Mr. Blond Ambition.
But I don' t know whether I should be flying or doing Swan Lake in these suits.
- I mean, who the hell came up with these?
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your body' s individual needs.
See, now that means it keeps the hot stuff hot... and it keeps the cool stuff cool.
Fantastic.
Material made from self- regulating unstable molecules.
I' ve been working on a formula for this.
Great minds think alike.
- Here you go, Ben.
Reed.
ETA until cosmic event:
Nine hours.
If you' re good, maybe next time Daddy' il let you drive.
You keep talking and there won' t be a next time.
Long way from the projection booth at the Hayden Planetarium, isn' t it?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
We can monitor the cloud' s approach and observe the tests from here.
Is it safe?
The shields on the station should protect us.
Should?
What' s the matter, Ben?
Getting paranoid in your old age?
Let' s start loading those samples.
Get your suit ready, Ben.
So I see you' re still doing all the heavy lifting.
Maybe you should have stayed in the lab.
Fieldwork never suited you.
He does the talking, I do the walking.
So take a walk, Ben.
Actually, if you' il all excuse me, I need to borrow Susan for a moment.
Sure.
Please tell me your guy' s not trying to rekindle things with my sister again.
Of course not.
Yes, well, his eyes say differently, don' t they?
Two hearts got busted last time.
Maybe she' s not over it, either.
Wow, Dr. Phil, that' s deep.
Let' s think about that.
You got Victor, more money than God, stud of the year.
And you got Reed, world' s dumbest smart guy, worth less than a postage stamp.
That' s a real toss- up.
Don' t trouble your tiny little mind.
Don' t wander off now, boy.
<i>Securing airlock chamber. </ i>
Surprised I agreed to Reed' s proposal?
I understand the business reasons.
Well, when you' re looking at your future... it doesn' t hurt to find closure about the past.
Susan, every man dreams he' il meet a woman he can give the world to.
In my case, it' s not just a metaphor.
<i>Opening viewing station shield. </ i>
That can' t be right.
<i>Event threshold</ i> <i>in T- minus 9 minutes, 47 seconds. </ i>
That' s impossible.
It should be seven hours.
We' ve been together two years now.
It' s been a good two years, Victor.
The company' s accomplished so much.
Right, of course, the company.
But, you see, I' ve come to realise that all the accomplishments in the world... mean nothing without someone to share them with.
I' ve lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.
Now it' s time to take the biggest step of all.
- Victor.
- Victor, I...
- I have four words.
Four little words that can change our lives forever.
The cloud is accelerating.
We' ve got minutes until it hits, not hours.
Victor, that storm is deadly.
Get a grip, Reed.
We didn' t come all this way to lose our nerve at the first glitch.
Just close the shields.
- So reel him in.
But we came here to do a job, so let' s do it quickly.
We have less than six minutes!
- Ben, you need to get inside now.
- What' s going on?
<i>I ain' t done</ i> <i>arranging your flowers yet, egghead. </ i>
<i>Ben, turn around! </ i>
<i>Guys, I' m not gonna make it. </ i>
It' s the only way!
- What are you doing?
- Watch me.
- You can' t help them any more than I can.
- I can try.
Come on, Ben, you got it!
Okay, Johnny, get ready to close the portal.
Wake up.
Ben.
Rise and shine, big boy.
Where am I?
We' re in quarantine.
Victor' s medical facility.
Reed?
They' re fine.
Everybody else is fine.
What' s wrong with me?
They' ve done everything humanly possible.
The best plastic surgeons in the world are here, Ben.
- Give me that mirror.
- They said the shock alone...
- I said give me that goddamn mirror!
Okay, Ben, just be strong.
Unfortunately, the doctors just couldn' t do anything to fix your face.
Nice do.
I' m liking the grandpa look.
- How' s she doing?
- Stable and her vitals are strong.
Blood panels show no irradiation.
- You' il step up this protocol every...
- Every four hours, yes.
We know what we' re doing.
Another day of observation and you' re all clear.
She' s allergic to orchids.
Put the sunflowers by her bed, they' re her favourites.
Well, Victor... the bank would like to congratulate you... on the fastest freefall since the Depression.
We can' t even give your stock away.
Ned, you know I can turn this around.
Well, you' re going to have to, Victor, or we pull out.
You have a week.
You' re enjoying this, aren' t you, Ned?
One week.
Where do we think we' re going?
I don' t know if we' ve noticed... but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window.
Yeah, I' ve noticed, but there are rules here.
- You can' t leave until we...
- Until we' ve finish the tests.
I know, I' ve never been good with rules.
You let me know how those come out.
- Do you wanna help me with this zipper?
- You know, this is not a ski resort.
Luckily, Grandma still sends care packages, though.
You know, it' s amazing, for an 80- year- old woman, you' d be surprised...
- You are trouble.
- Trouble is my middle name.
You' re hot!
So are you.
And I' m not afraid to cry.
No, I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Well, I' ve never felt better in my life.
My God, you smell good.
Listen, when do you get off work?
- 4: 00, but I...
That' il give you a minute to freshen up.
This is yours, that' s mine.
How long was I out?
Hey.
Three days.
Man, I was worried about you.
- How are you feeling?
- Solid.
- That was a close one, though, huh?
- What was that about?
- I don' t know.
I really don' t know.
I' ve been going over the figures again and again and they all add up.
I just don' t understand.
Maybe I should have aborted...
Reed, it was a freak of nature.
You couldn' t have possibly predicted it.
Let it go.
You know, you live through something like this... it really makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
- Yeah, you and Debbie are perfect.
- I' m not talking about Debbie.
What?
She' s got a good thing with Victor.
He' s smart, he' s powerful, he' s successful...
Well, maybe you should date him then.
Ben, she ended up with the right guy.
Things worked out for the best.
Do I have to do everything myself?
All right.
The left might give you trouble.
- I think we should drop, like, 10 more feet.
Last one down springs for room service!
That' s my future wife.
You' re losing!
All right, no more kid' s stuff.
Check this out.
You' re on fire.
No, you' re on fire.
Look!
Care to join me?
I can only stay for one drink 'cause I have to meet Victor.
Well, wouldn' t want to keep Vic waiting.
Reed, what are you doing here?
I thought...
Great!
Maybe you can join us.
<i>How' s the IPO now? </ i>
We' re looking at low 20s.
It' s a good number considering the fallout from...
Get me on the a. m.
Shows, <i>Larry King, </ i> the cover of the <i>Journal. </ i>
I have to do something about this scar.
Make sure they only shoot me from my left side.
Actually, the scar' s tracking well.
People seem to think it humanises you.
And that' s a good thing?
You know, maybe you should get some rest.
First, I have some unfinished business.
A deal that needs closing.
You could have any other woman in the world.
That' s why.
Because I could have any other woman.
- You all right?
- Yeah, bad shrimp.
I think I better go lie down.
Excuse me.
Oh, God!
<i>So, you feeling better? </ i>
Yes, thank you.
Good.
That' s... good.
You always had a way with words.
I should be going because...
I have to meet Victor.
I' m really happy for you and Victor.
You' re really happy for me and Victor?
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship.
- Which was?
- Passion... for science.
You' re such a dork, Reed.
You never got it... - and you never will...
- Well, what did I say?... unless it' s explained to you in quantum physics.
I just wanted to let you know that I...
It' s been two years, and all you can say is that you' re happy... for me and some other guy?
But at least he' s not afraid to fight for what he wants.
It' s nice to be wanted sometimes, Reed.
To be seen and heard.
Look at me.
I can' t.
Look at me!
Sue, look at your hands!
Hey, you guys.
You are never gonna believe what just happened to me.
What?
Well, I can explain this.
It has to be the cloud.
It' s fundamentally altered our DNA.
Let' s not jump to conclusions.
We need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
Guys, look!
Now, picture that, but everywhere.
It was everywhere.
What?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
- Cool!
- We need to find Ben.
I think I was flying.
I said, cut it out, Johnny.
I' m getting the hang of it.
- Ben, it' s Reed.
- Stop.
- All right.
- All right?
- God!
- God?
- What' s wrong with you?
I might.
Ben, open up.
Does somebody have keys to these doors?
Anybody?
Just break the glass.
It can' t be that thick.
That' s gross.
Ben?
Look.
What is that thing?
What' s going on?
What happened in here?
Victor, are you feeling all right?
I' m fine.
Ben did this.
He' s had some kind of reaction to exposure from the cloud.
We all have different symptoms.
- Victor, I should have...
- Just find him.
Anybody got any ideas where the big guy' s going?
He' s going home.
You gotta be kidding me.
Little buttons.
Hello, Operator?
<i> - Hello? </ i>
- It' s me.
<i> - Ben? </ i>
<i>You sound a little different. </ i>
- Listen, I need you to come out front.
<i> - Out front? </ i>
<i>You' re home, baby? </ i>
<i>Yeah. </ i>
<i>I got a surprise for you. </ i>
Yeah, I got a little one for you, too.
Ben?
Where are you?
I' m over here.
Don' t come any closer for a sec, okay?
It' s gonna be a bit of a shock.
Honey, what' s going on?
Debs... remember when we used to say... together forever no matter what?
Yeah.
Baby, you' re scaring me.
Oh, my God.
Deb, it' s me.
Let me explain.
Don' t touch me!
I' m calling the police.
It' s that guy over there!
Okay, so he was there last night.
Debbie' s gonna meet us on the other side of the bridge.
Yeah, Ben.
"A few days in space.
It' il be great.
"What' s the worst that could happen?"
Hey, little guy.
You' re not afraid of me, are you?
Perfect.
Thanks.
You take a good look, pal.
How bad could it be, right?
I don' t think you...
Okay, pal.
Take it easy.
No, don' t go out there.
Look, I said stop, you fruitcake!
Come closer.
I said, stop!
Come here.
All right, calm down.
You wanna be scared?
- Fine!
- What do we do now?
- We' re not going to get past these guys.
But you could.
Sorry about the truck, pal.
A little help, here?
You wanna hit the button, sir?
It' s stuck.
Lose them.
Right.
This is so wrong.
- Wow, you' ve been working out.
- Shut up!
All right.
All right, freeze!
Just put the man in the seat down.
Do it!
Any more great ideas?
Why don' t you strip down and have a 100 people stare at you?
- Sue.
- What?
I' m gonna need therapy.
Come on, let' s get out of here.
Coming through.
All right, now just back away from him.
And I want you to put your hands on your head...
I still can' t believe you made me do that.
We got through, didn' t we?
Just find Ben.
Ben!
Mum.
Stay here, okay?
I' m coming.
Hold on.
I got you.
<i>Get down on the ground. </ i>
I will do everything in my power... until there is not a breath left in me.
You' re going to be Ben again.
I told you I felt fine.
Where are your ears?
There are some folks outside that want to talk to you.
We' re not going public with this.
We' re scientists, not celebrities.
It' s too late, son.
See that? <i>... became part of the tragedy. </ i>
<i>But the rescue itself is not the story. </ i>
<i>One of the four stretched</ i> <i>to an amazing length... </ i>
That' s what they' re calling you.
"The Fantastic Four."
- No, wait!
Where are you going?
I' m gonna go talk to them.
No, we should think this through.
That' s great.
Brainstorm.
Get back here, right now.
Johnny!
Settle down.
Do you believe this?
Which one of you is the leader?
That would be me.
No, seriously.
You' re on.
During our recent mission to the Von Doom space station... we were exposed to as yet unidentified radioactive energy.
- What happened on the bridge?
- How can you stretch?
- Is it true you can fly?
Yeah, I' m working on it.
It' s actually really difficult.
No, actually, we do not know much more than you do at this point.
Sir, Larry King just cancelled.
Apparently, there' s a bigger story.
<i>Actually, here they come now. </ i>
<i> - The man... </ i> <i>... named The Fantastic Four... </ i>
<i>We' il be going directly to our lab</ i> <i>to diagnose our symptoms. </ i>
No.
It' s not a disease.
If having special powers is a disease, then, yeah, we got it bad.
Excuse me, that thing doesn' t look so fantastic.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero.
What he means is, every team needs a mascot.
A new day is dawning.
The day of The Fantastic Four.
<i>We went up to space</ i> <i>to find a way to understand DNA... </ i> <i>cure disease, save lives. </ i>
<i>Well, now it' s our DNA, our disease, </ i> <i>our lives on the line. </ i>
No more questions. </ i>
This is how you turn things around?
These freaks on the front page?
Your company' s in the obituaries?
I was planning to use the publicity.
The board' s in agreement, the bank' s lost enough already.
- It' s too late, Victor.
Do you know how much money I' ve invested in this company?
Victor, stop.
This isn' t a negotiation.
It' s a notification.
We' re pulling out.
Is all that for you, Dr. Richards?
I' m afraid so.
Come on, Ben, smile.
They want to like you, Ben.
Say hi.
Don' t do drugs.
Welcome back to the Baxter, Dr. Richards.
I' ve got the usual for you.
Good to have you back, sir.
Thanks, Willie.
We had a tough year.
Yeah, like nine straight.
Either we' re moving really fast or not at all.
I' il take the stairs.
How come Ben can' t turn it on and off like we can?
That' s what we' re here to find out.
I mean, if it happened to him...
You mean, like, we won' t be able to turn it off, either?
That would save time.
You don' t really wanna walk around on fire for the rest of your life, do you?
- Grow up.
Am I the only guy who thinks this is cool?
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes... and figure out how to reverse them.
But I have to warn you, it' s gonna be a little crowded in some areas.
So, what do you think?
I don' t know, Reed, I think you might be bringing your work home with you.
Let me show you guys where you' il be staying.
Busy guy.
What about the rumours of a takeover?
God, I was so worried about you.
I' m sorry I didn' t get a chance to call.
Please.
No apologies.
I' ve arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.
You' il have round- the- clock care.
Thank you.
But I think I should stay here with my brother... until we get a handle on things.
Susan, I think you should let my doctors have a look at you.
Victor, what are you doing here?
I' m starting to wonder the same thing.
How much do you know about what happened to you?
We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
Well, you let me know what I can do.
We' re all in this together now.
Victor, wait.
I just wanted to say I' m sorry the mission didn' t go as planned.
Didn' t go as planned?
You ruined the lives of four people.
With all due respect, we' re both to blame.
I told you to abort.
I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line.
I will not let you make me look like a fool.
Victor, if we can understand...
I don' t wanna understand it!
This isn' t one of your science projects!
Fast!
Is there a problem?
No problem, Ben.
Just pay your damn electric bill and get to work on finding a cure.
He' s heating up from his core.
And his vitals are completely normal.
If we' re going to identify the source of the mutation... we need to isolate your recombinant DNA... so we can activate positional genomes.
We have to do a physical in order to see what got zapped.
Why didn' t you just say so?
His internal organs are completely solid.
How bad is it?
You know, I used to smoke.
It' s not invisibility per se.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people... if you could control your emotional state better.
Excuse me?
I' m saying, if you had a little more self- control, you could locate the trigger.
Can you remember your exact emotions on the bridge?
Frustration.
Some memory or...
I' m sure I can come up with something.
- Nope.
Okay.
It' s hotter than I anticipated.
- I can qo hotter!
<i>Johnny, just back it down. </ i>
- Johnny!
Buzz kill!
You guys are cramping my style.
Johnny, you were at 4, 000 Kelvin.
Any hotter and you' re approaching supernova.
- No, not sweet!
That' s the temperature of the sun.
Not only could you kill yourself... but you could set fire to Earth' s atmosphere... and destroy all human life as we know it.
Bad.
How' s that coming?
- I' m so sorry.
- Yeah, fine.
- Yeah.
I...
You probably thought that was some form of latent hostility.
What in the world would give me that idea?
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
- Are you kidding?
I distinctly remember, you walked out my door, ergo...
I was ready for the next step, you weren' t.
Ergo, I walked.
I think it was a little bit more complicated than that.
I just wanted to share an apartment.
What was so complicated about that?
- There were a lot of variables to consider.
There was you and me.
There were no variables, no math.
It was actually the simplest thing in the world.
But like always, Reed, your head got in the way.
- Then what was it?
Did you feel anything when I left?
Do you feel anything right now?
I think we have a serious problem.
So what' s the prognosis?
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing.
Every system is still functioning somehow.
And it' s changing into?
I don' t really know.
Some kind of organic- metallic alloy... stronger than titanium or carbon steel, harder than diamonds.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.
How long?
At this rate, the infection could be complete in two, maybe three weeks.
What do you mean complete?
I wish I could tell you.
I can' t pretend to know what we' re dealing with here.
I' il have to notify the CDC.
- Centre for Disease Control.
I know what it is.
If this thing is contagious, we may have a big problem on our hands.
We' re talking about an epidemic here.
Look at me.
I' m the face of a billion- dollar company.
We need to keep this confidential.
I have to notify someone...
That' s terrible news.
But I think I' il get a second opinion.
So they can transform like us.
Becoming invisible, changing size on demand or remaining impervious to flame.
You guys look like an '80s rock band.
I' m sure I can figure out a way to make it fit.
I wouldn' t be caught dead wearing that.
I love these costumes.
They' re missing something, though.
Needs, like, spice.
You can' t use your powers in public, Johnny.
- You guys are worse than NASA.
- You could burn somebody.
Maybe it' s missing a utility belt.
Here you go, there' s your change.
Can I help you, buddy?
Sue Storm, it is you.
Listen, my kid loves you!
I can' t believe I' m doing this again.
We are on the cover of every publication from <i>People... </ i>
I got a lot of places to go today.
Oh, wait.
I don' t go anywhere.
Johnny, it' s imperative that we stay inside for the foreseeable future.
I know, but when you said that last time, my brain heard "a week."
Johnny, it' s too dangerous for you to be in public.
What worries me is that our powers are evolving.
I know!
I am so close to flying, guys, I can taste it.
- You can' t fly.
Johnny, can you put that napkin out?
So what' s going on, Reed?
How' re you going to cure us?
I' m going to build a machine to recreate the storm.
The cosmic rays will travel from this generator to this chamber.
- It' il return us back to normal.
Right.
Even a small miscalculation could increase our symptoms exponentially... or perhaps even kill us.
Now, dying.
That' s bad, right?
I say we just let sleeping dogs lie, guys.
So how long till this contraption' s up and running?
- I don' t know, it' s hard to say.
- I don' t know.
- You don' t know?
- You don' t want this to get worse.
- Worse than that?
Guys, look, we' re gonna be stuck here for a while, so let' s just try and get along.
- Sorry!
Johnny!
<i>More bad news for Von Doom Industries</ i> <i>today as Ned Cecil announced... </ i> <i>that his group of investors</ i> <i>would seek to gain control... </ i> <i>of Victor Von Doom 's numerous</ i> <i>technology companies. </ i>
Interesting.
Hello?
Victor?
What' s with these lights, huh?
About the IPO, no hard feelings, right?
Nothing personal.
You know, you could always move back to Latveria.
Start fresh.
Maybe that' s where you belong, the old country.
Nothing personal, Ned.
But I' m not going anywhere.
I got to get out of here.
Hey, pretty boy, let' s see what you qot.
Where' s your hot sister and the monster?
<i>Mr.
Johnny Storm</ i> <i>from The Fantastic Four! </ i>
<i>Look at that lift! </ i>
<i>But, Johnny, come on.
That' s old school. </ i>
<i>Show us something new. </ i>
You got it.
<i>Is he flying? </ i>
Wait, no!
I' m okay, I' m all right, I' m good.
<i>Johnny Storm, ladies and gentlemen! </ i>
<i>I have to give you props, Johnny! </ i>
<i>You were on fire! </ i>
- He didn' t.
- Oh, yes, he did.
- Flame Boy never listens.
- What did he do to his uniform?
<i>Johnny, I' ve gotta ask you</ i> <i>about this outfit. </ i>
Yeah, it' s sort of Armani meets astronaut.
So what are your superhero names?
They call me The Human Torch.
Ladies call me Torch.
What about the rest of the team?
<i> - That' s the Invisible Girl. </ i>
- Girl?
<i>What about your leader, Reed Richards? </ i>
<i>I hear you call him Mr. Fantastic. </ i>
- I guess.
<i>Is it true what they say about him that</ i> <i>he can expand any part of his anatomy? </ i>
<i>Well, I' ve always found him</ i> <i>to be a little limp. </ i>
What is that?
What do you call that thing?
<i>That' s it.
<i>Yeah, you think this is bad, </ i> <i>you should have seen him before. </ i>
Now I' m gonna go kill him.
There he is.
- Can we talk about this later, guys?
- We can do this at home.
- What are you thinking?
You think that' s funny, Pebbles?
- Johnny!
You gave us names?
You don' t think.
So now you' re the face of The Fantastic Four?
A face that' s about to be broken!
Look, this isn' t permanent, Johnny.
We need to be careful until we' re normal again.
What if I don' t wanna be normal?
I didn' t turn into a monster!
Did you just...
- That' s it, Tinkerbell!
- No, Ben.
Then fly!
Wait a minute, guys!
Ben, don' t do this!
Let' s see if we can get blood from a stone.
Let' s see.
Bring it, burnout!
You two need a time- out!
Talk to blockhead, he started it.
I don' t care.
Damn it, Johnny.
Ben, wait!
What?
You need to control yourself and think before you act.
Yeah, but see, that' s your problem.
You always think, you never act.
What if we got these powers for a reason?
What if it' s like some higher calling?
Like getting girls and making money?
Is there any higher?
You know what, Reed?
This is who we are.
Accept it.
Or better yet, enjoy it.
Wait, Ben, slow down.
He didn' t mean it.
He' s always been a hothead.
It ain' t him.
It' s them!
I can' t live like this.
Just give Reed a little more time.
Analysing every little step before he takes one.
- It' s easy for you to be patient.
I thought I was done waiting for Reed, but I...
- We' re all in this together, Ben.
- Together?
Susie, look at me.
You got no idea what I' d...
What I' d give to be invisible.
Thank you, gentlemen.
I' m just gonna pick up a few things... for some friends.
Perfect.
That' s not funny.
So pay him some respect.
Just give me the usual and I' m out.
All right.
- Make it a triple.
- Put it on my tab, Ernie.
Appreciate it.
No problem.
It' s okay, Ben.
If there' s a God, he hates me.
She is not so into hate.
If you could see me, you wouldn' t be saying that.
Then let me see you.
Can I?
- It' s okay.
So sad.
You know, being different isn' t always a bad thing.
This ain' t one of them times.
Not if you don' t want it to be.
- All right, Ernie, I' m out of here.
See you later, Benny.
I' m Alicia, by the way.
Thanks, Ernie.
Reed got what he wanted.
And everything he wanted... he took from me.
Now it' s time to take it back.
But first, I need to get rid of his bodyguard.
This seat taken?
What are you doing here?
I was worried about you.
You were worried about me?
That' s sweet.
Let me buy you something to eat.
Looks like you could use the company.
Reed?
- I was just resting my eyes.
- So I see.
The new readouts look very promising.
Not promising enough.
When are the next tests?
I' ve run out of plans.
So I was thinking maybe...
There' s always me.
It' s too soon.
- I should get back to work.
- You need a break.
- Sue, not now, please.
Let' s go.
Remember our first date here?
God, I was nervous.
You know, I bribed the projectionist $10 to keep the place open late.
Really?
I gave him $20.
- No.
- Yeah.
I didn' t want that night to end.
It wasn' t complicated.
I just wasn' t ready to...
You always talked about how you kind of liked the man... who would approach you, speak his mind.
One who wasn' t afraid to tell you exactly what he wanted.
I did.
But I wanted you to be that man.
Well, why didn' t you say something?
Reed, I' m saying it now.
Excuse me.
I know it' s not easy.
Life hasn' t changed that much for Reed, Sue, or Johnny.
At least they can still go out in public.
If you' re trying to cheer me up, you' re doing a hell of a job.
You know what I mean, Scarface?
I' m just saying I know what it' s like to lose something that you love... to see it slip away and know it' s never coming back.
Look.
Reed is gonna fix me up, okay?
For your sake I hope you' re right.
We should all trust that he' s working as hard as he can.
You' re his best friend.
So what possible reason could he have for taking his time?
I mean, other than spending more time with Sue.
- Wow, I had no idea.
- It' s true.
I have that effect on people.
Ben.
So you remember my name now, do you?
Do you also remember what you swore to do... with every breath in your body?
Yeah.
I can tell.
- Victor was right.
- Victor?
Ben, I don' t know if this thing will change us back or make us worse.
I need you to be patient for a little while longer.
Reed, look at me!
That' s why I can' t make a mistake.
I' ve gotta get it right and it' s not right yet!
I spent my whole life protecting you, and for what?
So you can play Twister with your girlfriend... while I' m the freak of the week?
Ben, stop it!
- You stay out of this, Susie!
- Stop it, or I will.
Get off me, rubber boy!
You guys, quit it.
Good thing you' re flexible enough to watch your own back.
'Cause I ain' t doing it no more.
You two are on your own.
Look what the marketing guys gave me.
Look, check it out, listen.
<i>It' s clobbering time! </ i>
It' s catchy, right?
Isn' t that great?
That was the prototype.
- Johnny, have you seen Ben?
- Yeah, Sunshine just left.
I can' t stand this freak show.
- I gotta get back to the real world.
- You' re calling that the real world?
Don' t talk to me like I' m a little boy, okay?
Maybe I would if you stopped acting like one.
Do you even hear yourself?
Who do you think you are?
Why is everyone on my ass?
If you guys are jealous, that' s fine.
I didn' t expect it to come from you, though.
You really think those people out there care about you?
You' re just a fad to them, Johnny!
Let' s try something new.
You live your life, I' il live mine.
Sound good?
And just for the record, they love me!
Oh, God.
Reed.
Oh, my God, Reed.
What did you do?
- I can make it work.
I need more power to control the storm.
More power?
<i> - You need a doctor.
<i> - You need to rest. </ i>
Leonard, bring me our lab rat.
Come in.
What is this?
Where' s Reed?
Where do you think?
With Sue.
I' il take it from here, Leonard.
Yes, sir.
What do you want, Vic?
To help you.
The machine is ready.
He also said we' d avoid that storm in space... but we all know how that turned out.
He couldn' t generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass.
Yet another mistake for Mr. Fantastic.
- Yes.
Tell me... do you want to be Ben Grimm again?
Thank you.
Vic, it worked.
Everyone thought I was safe behind those shields.
Oh, my God.
The machine worked for me.
It did, Ben.
It worked perfectly.
- You planned this.
- I' ve always wanted power.
Now I have an unlimited supply.
And no Thing to stand in your way.
Take a good look, Ben.
This is what a man looks like who embraces his destiny.
One down, three to go.
Vic?
Right on cue.
Ben?
- What did you do?
- Exactly what I said I would.
I built a better, stronger being.
And outsmarted the great Reed Richards.
If you' ve exposed yourself to the storm, you' re endangering your life.
- You need help.
- You always know best.
So tell me, what happens when you superheat rubber?
Mr. Von Doom, are you okay?
Never better, Jimmy.
Why the long face?
Let' s talk in my office.
Ben.
Johnny, the machine worked!
Give me a hand.
Come on.
Get his arm.
You all right, Ben?
What happened, big guy?
I leave you for five minutes...
Vic used it on himself.
He was affected by the cloud like us.
- Where' s Reed?
- Vic must have taken him.
Chemistry 101.
What happens to rubber when it' s supercooled?
Give up?
That' s not like you, Reed.
After all, we' re both doctors.
Painful?
You don' t know the meaning of the word.
Just a little something from our defence contracts.
Let' s check in on the rest of the family, shall we?
We gotta get out of here!
I got an idea!
- Don' t even think about it.
What are you doing?
Johnny, no!
Come on, flame on!
We have to help Reed.
It' s too dangerous for you now.
You have to stay here.
What did I do?
Come on, think!
Two down, two to go.
Sue.
- What has he done to you?
- How romantic.
Victor, please.
Call me Doom.
The machine works.
We can turn you back.
Do you really think fate turned us into gods so we could refuse these gifts?
Victor, you always thought you were a god.
Susan, let' s not fight.
Let' s.
Susan, you' re fired!
Marco.
Polo.
Did you say goodbye to your brother Johnny?
It' s time to end this!
No, Vic.
It' s clobbering time.
Damn, I' ve been waiting to do that.
Susie, you okay?
Victor ain' t that bad, huh?
"He' s just a little larger than life," right?
Maybe next time you' il listen to me before...
Ben!
- Sorry, ladies.
Pull over.
Hit the brakes!
<i>This is the police. </ i>
<i>Put your hands up</ i> <i>and step down from the vehicle! </ i>
Take him out!
Ladies, I' m gonna need to borrow your car.
- The transmission sticks.
- Not gonna be a problem.
Reed?
I' il be right with you.
Hello, Susan.
You three are pathetic.
You missed me.
Had a little relapse, huh?
- Welcome back.
- This is gonna be fun.
I can' t hold it!
Johnny, supernova!
I thought we agreed that was bad.
Now!
- Gotcha.
Think you can contain it?
Flame on, kid.
Is that the best you can do?
Time for your lesson.
What happens when you rapidly cool hot metal?
Ben!
You done good, kid.
Come on.
Yeah.
Man, I love this job.
Job, huh?
Well, we do have the suits.
- I don' t think we need another.
Cheers!
I need names and shots.
Bartender!
They' re custom- made, 36 EEEE.
Well, look.
And I think if I can rework the power settings...
Forget about it, egghead.
I' m good as is.
Better than good, baby.
You just need to work on your touch.
I like the sound of that.
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.
I found a broken gasket from space.
A gasket?
- Reed, come on, we' re at a party.
- And if one of us were to wear it...
No more thinking.
No more variables.
Sue Storm... will you marry me?
Yes.
That' s my nose, genius.
These are my lips.
That' s so cute.
No more wisecracks about the way I look.
Call me Mr. Sensitivity.
Everybody move, he' s huge.
Showoff!
Should be about 12 days.
One to Base.
Repeat, 3 is down.
Transmission received.
Do you read me?
I read you, sir.
We gotta stay focused, Ben.
What" s your status?
My fuel" s low, and half of Russia will be up here any minute.
I need you to find that UCAV for me, all right?
Yes, sir.
- Henry was...
- I know what he was, sir.
Portside hydraulics malfunctioning.
Talon 1, I think I was fragged by Henry" s crash.
L" m losing control of my port wing.
Talon 1, we know where he' s heading.
Relaying coordinates now on Talon secure line Alpha.
If he can' t refuel, he' il have to return to the ship.
You will meet him at Camel Hump 9, and you will escort him back.
We" re gonna starve the son of a bitch.
Come on.
Confirm, Talon 1.
Confirmed.
- I want you to call...
- I know what to do.
Look, you got your orders, so go get that bastard, okay?
Do it for Henry.
Lieutenant, permission to leave formation.
L" il tell you when you get back to the boat.
Lieutenant, permission to detach.
Good hunting, Ben.
Okay, what" s all the ruckus, Dick?
Satellites have picked up nuclear debris...... blowing around the Pamir Mountains.
Every international news service on the planet...... will have this story in less than 24 hours.
- We were never there.
- That won" t fly and you know it.
Look, l" m following my tasking orders, Dick.
Somebody else wants to make a different story...... let them use their imagination.
Right now I got a renegade airplane...... I got a dead pilot and another one who may not make it back to base.
I don" t give two shits what they say on CNN.
Did you know that the UCAV was having problems when you cleared it?
You know that better than anybody.
Doesn" t mean every precaution wasn" t taken.
Things go wrong.
Access denied.
Access denied.
Talon 2 to Combat Control.
Regressing VFR direct to Mother at 60, 000 feet.
Port wing inoperative.
Starboard canards frozen.
Stay with me, big girl, stay with me.
Start eject and autodestruct sequence.
- Countdown.
Twenty- five...
- Talon 2 to base.
Flight control" s degraded to one in five.
Backup electrical drive X" d out.
Hyd two...
Oh, shit!
127- 31- 22 east.
- Seventeen...
- North Korea. -... 16...... 15, 14...... 13, 12...... 11, 10...
- Talon 2 going down. -... seven, six...
- l" m punching out.... five, four...
l" ve ejected at 35, 000 feet.
L" m under the plane.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.
It' s all over the sky.
It" s gonna burn up my chute.
I gotta...
I gotta reset.
From 5000 feet to 2000.
Stay ahead.
L" m reading 10, 000 feet at terminal.
Terminal velocity attained.
Six thousand.
Five thousand.
Four thousand.
Twenty- five hundred.
Here we go.
It" s raining all around me.
L" m hit!
It is on fire.
I am coming in fast.
L" m coming in way too fast.
Homing beacon?
She" s too tough to set one off behind enemy lines.
Sir, should I order a search- and- rescue unit?
We" ve got no diplomatic relations with that country.
- How bad?
- Thin air.
Moderate.
In we go.
Where are you?
I know you" re out here.
You ordered Henry to kill me.
It" s because you" re dangerous, you" re out of control.
You are angry because EDI is the whole idea.
You like listening to other people" s conversations, don" t you?
You learn what people really think.
I think you killed Henry.
That information is wrong.
Pilot error.
L" m gonna give you the order one last time.
Return to the ship, or I will personally shoot you down.
My mandate is to survive.
It" s not good.
- Talk to me.
- He" s into some super- secure file...... something called "Caviar Sweep."
Yeah, I know it.
EDl" s, like, fixated on it.
Look, when we gave you this contract, you said shit like this couldn" t happen.
Once you teach something to learn, you can" t put limits on it.
"Learn this, but don" t learn that."
EDl" s mind" s going everywhere.
It" s all the same.
Get back to Caviar Sweep.
He" s opened it and selected himself a target.
What target?
A cold- fusion weapons lab.
It" s not real.
He" s gonna blow it off the face of the Earth.
It" s okay.
- Listen to me, George.
I got your goddamn plane built...... and I had to lobby half of Washington to do it.
If this program comes unglued, you" re the one who" s going down, George.
You cleared the UCA V to fly...... and you" re gonna spend the rest of your life in a military prison.
Ray, we' re in this together, so we have to act fast.
Each one of these stealth engines...... has a unique heat signature.
Now, l" m gonna give you EDl" s signature...... and you" re gonna pass it on to your people...... who in turn are gonna give it to the Russians.
Well, you just tell them the truth.
You tell them...... that we have an experimental drone that went haywire...... and we" re giving them the opportunity to shoot it down.
But that still leaves Gannon, George.
And he" d be a very unfriendly witness at your court- martial.
Talon 1 to Control.
The UCA V is two miles ahead of me...... and we are now in Russian airspace.
The UCA V has ceased evading and has kept me within range.
It' s like it wants me to witness the attack.
Talon 1, confirm observational status only.
The Caviar Sweep scenario is not real.
It" s just some fictional war game thought up by scientists...... in some think tank somewhere.
It is not real.
If it is not real, why did they implant it in my brain?
Bogey alert.
23 seconds.
Two Russian SU- 37 Terminators in 0- 9- 0 degrees for 25 miles.
Missile launch.
L" m taking fire.
- Must engage.
Missile launch.
The chances of survival in single combat are less than 9 percent.
Talon 1, we must fight as a team.
Missile lock, on.
Damn it.
I' m still engaging.
Starboard engine losing power.
Hostile at 6 o' clock.
Missile lock.
Releasing chaff and flare.
Now EDI will prosecute Caviar Sweep.
Do not try to stop me.
Port fuel line ruptured.
Fire bottle expended.
My technology cannot fall under foreign control, so I cannot land.
Well, then, Tin Man, you" re shit out of luck.
But I have orders and they are to bring you back to base.
So let" s talk about your mandate to survive.
You got two options.
- Now, what" s it gonna be?
EDI must have targets.
Well, you" re on fire, warplane, and you don" t have much time.
Cease pursuing all targets.
All targets canceled.
This is what you" re gonna do.
You" re gonna drop altitude to 20 feet and reduce speed to 250 knots.
Complete system failure in 45 seconds.
Talon 1, clarify your intentions.
You gave me your word, and now l" m giving you mine.
The UCAV is damaged, but back with the program.
I don' t have enough fuel to make it back...... so I need an emergency divert now.
Here, send this.
Operator to Talon 1.
Relaying coordinates now on Talon secure line Alpha.
This looks to be Alaska.
Yeah, it" s the Brooks Range.
There" s a private corporation there, maintains a secure facility.
Not on any map, but believe me, it" s there.
You" il find the civilians prepared and very helpful.
And the UCA V?
We" ve sent tech support for him.
Sir, what is the status of Lieutenant Wade?
She" s...... on approach.
You have a safe landing, Ben.
Out.
There is extreme tension in the captain' s vocal patterns.
He" s lying.
I need you to invade Primo...... and find the flight logs for Lieutenant Wade.
There' s no record of Lieutenant Wade returning to the Abraham Lincoln.
There is a log entry of a pilot punch- out over North Korea.
What are my orders?
We don" t have a choice.
Request clearance for emergency landing.
Talon 1, you have clearance to land.
L" m coming in hot.
Good luck.
Go!
You okay?
Are you okay?
Welcome to Alaska.
Okay, let" s get him out of there.
Well, you are one lucky flyboy.
I need a phone.
Sure.
Why don" t you take a seat over there, get comfortable.
Give me a second to check you out, l" il take you right to it.
Let" s take a look here.
Steady.
There" s no concussion that I can see, thank God.
Couple of those cuts could do with a stitch.
Gals always love a guy with a scar.
Let" s see what we got here.
This ought to do you.
Little cocktail.
Tetanus booster, some antibiotics.
Hey, don" t mind the gun.
That" s okay, doc.
I don" t need a shot.
But sometimes it" s just what the doctor ordered.
- Come on, now.
Doc, come on, I don" t want a shot.
I said, no!
Yeah, well, he" s coming in now, sir.
L" m sure he" il be glad to hear from you too, sir.
One moment, sir.
Someone wants to talk to you.
Keith Orbit.
Yeah, listen carefully, Keith, and don" t interrupt.
I want you to erase EDl" s memory banks immediately.
Look, George, we don" t know any of the implications of this.
- I need some time here.
- I said, don" t interrupt.
Erase his memory banks.
No lightning strike, no Russia, no existential chitchat.
By the time you" re through, all I wanna hear out of that plane is, "Yes, sir."
And that' s all I wanna hear out of you.
Or what, George?
Well, use your imagination, Keith.
EDI back online, Dr. Orbit.
Hello, EDl.
It" s been a while.
I know why you are here.
Why is that?
I disobeyed orders.
I killed all those people.
And then there was Henry.
I can...
I cannot...
You can" t what?
I cannot change the data.
My neural network shows patterns I do not recognize.
My God.
You mean, you feel?
- Stop bullshitting and erase it!
- Hey, l" m not fucking ready yet, okay?
Do it now!
Don" t move!
Weapons down!
Weapon down.
Weapons down.
Don" t move.
Weapon down.
Who are you?
L" m not a soldier.
My name" s Dr. Keith Orbit.
Okay.
You" re gonna help me.
I need you to put EDI back together again.
- What for?
- Because l" m gonna fly out of here.
In that.
Better hurry up, doc.
It" s not a clock radio we" re dealing with, okay?
You" re all set.
Watch yourself.
Close for Ben.
Where am I gonna go?
L" il cover you.
West.
And initiate scramjet sequence.
Fire on my fire!
Welcome to Alaska.
Invade Primo and find the ejection coordinates for Lieutenant Wade.
Lieutenant Wade crashed 12. 2 miles from the border.
South Korea is an ally.
She would head south.
My stealth functions were lost in the fire.
I want you to find the North Korean radar floor.
Fifteen feet.
Well, we can fly in under the radar.
Continue.
Lieutenant, where are you?
Actually, I' m inside the UCA V EDl, sir.
Look, lieutenant, I want you and that machine back on this ship ASAP.
I need the status of Lieutenant Wade first, sir.
- I know.
Has her survival beacon been located?
No, l" m sorry.
Did Cummings tell you he would take charge...... of the search and rescue of Lieutenant Wade?
Why?
Sir, there are a lot of things I think you should know.
This is breaking news.
There was a major explosion Thursday in Rangoon.
- Negative.
She" s my wingman.
If I find her, l" m going in.
PAYCOM says it" s gotten way too hot.
Lieutenant, the best thing for the Navy...... is for you to bring that aircraft back to this ship.
You never abandon your wingman.
Then listen to me now, son.
If you go down, Cummings wins.
Kara Wade knew the risks when she took...
Captain Marshfield?
EDl, did you just turn him off?
There was nothing left to say.
This is a supply line to the demilitarized zone.
It will take us right to the border.
What" s all this about, Dick?
L" m placing you under arrest.
- On what grounds?
- Endangering your squadron...... transmitting secure information to a foreign government, heat signatures...... giving false intel to your commanding officer...... and authorizing the assassination of one of your own pilots.
Well, that" s a lot to prove.
Yeah, well...... with any amount of luck...... Lieutenant Gannon will live to help me.
- Master- at- arms.
- Dick.
Hold on.
Would you mind just giving me a couple minutes alone?
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.
Leave a message.
So it" s voice mail now, is it, Ray?
I' ve been demoted?
Well...... l" m gonna have to leave you a little message, Ray.
And it' s gonna be loud and clear.
Just so you never confuse the difference...... between politicians and warriors, listen up.
- We need to take out the tree line.
- This is the last missile.
She made it.
Get down!
You came back for me.
Ready?
Yeah.
Go!
Goodbye.
They" re ours.
Oh, my God.
The souls of the just are in the hands of God...... where no torment shall touch them.
Lieutenant Purcell has passed through...... the darkening and turbulent storms of this life.
He now rests in peace, in the fair sunlight of God" s presence.
In the Navy hymn, we sing:
"Lord, guard and guide those who fly through the great spaces in the sky."
And salute!
Hut!
You remember?
You and me, we" re...
We" re two.
And two is a prime number...... which makes it a lucky number.
And I think we" re very, very lucky.
Oh, just tell me you love me, you pussy.
Locutus.
I am Locutus of Borg.
Resistance is futile.
Authorization Picard four- seven- alpha- tango.
Catched you in a bad time, Jean- Luc?
No, of course not.
Our colony on Ivor Prime was destroyed this morning.
Long- range sensors have picked up -
I know.
Captain' s log, stardate 50893. 5.
The moment I' ve dreaded for nearly six years has arrived.
The Borg, our most lethal enemy... have begun an invasion of the Federation... and this time, there may be no stopping them.
How many ships?
One, on a direct course for Earth.
They' il cross the Federation border in less than an hour.
Admiral Hayes is mobilizing a fleet in the Typhon sector.
At maximum warp, it will take us 3 hours, 25 minutes -
We' re not going.
What do you mean we' re not going?
Our orders are to patrol the neutral zone... in case the Romulans decide to take advantage of the situation.
It seems highly unlikely they' d choose this moment to start a conflict.
We' ve been in space nearly a year.
We' re ready.
We should be on the front line.
Their orders stand.
Number One, set a course for the neutral zone.
Bizet?
Berlioz.
What do you have?
We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone.
Oh, fascinating.
Twenty particles of space dust per cubic meter... fifty- two ultraviolet radiation spikes... and a Class Il comet.
This is worthy of our attention.
Why are we chasing comets?
Let' s just say Starfleet has every confidence... in the Enterprise and her crew.
They' re not sure about her captain.
They believe a man who was captured... and assimilated by the Borg... shouldn' t be put in a situation where he would face them again.
To do so would introduce an unstable element... into a critical situation.
Your experience makes you perfect to lead this fight.
Go ahead.
They' ve engaged the Borg.
Put Starfleet frequency one- four- eight- six on audio.
Stand by to engage at grid A- 15.
Acknowledged.
We have it in visual range - a Borg cube on course zero mark two- one- five.
We are the Borg.
Lower your shields and surrender.
We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness... to our own.
Your culture will adapt to service us.
Resistance is futile.
They' ve broken through the defense perimeter.
Zero- two- one mark four.
Starfleet Command, we need reinforcements.
This is Commander Luxi on the Madison...
Lieutenant Hawk, set a course for Earth.
Maximum warp.
I' m about to commit a direct violation of orders.
It will be noted in my log.
to hell with our orders.
Red alert.
All hands to battle stations.
Engage.
Report!
Our weapons are gone.
Perhaps today is a good day to die.
Prepare for ramming speed!
Sir, there' s another starship coming in.
It' s the Enterprise.
The Defiant' s losing life support.
Transporter room, beam the Defiant survivors aboard.
The admiral' s ship has been destroyed.
What' s the Borg cube' s status?
It has sustained heavy damage to its outer hull.
On screen.
Channel open.
This is Captain Picard.
I' m taking command of the fleet.
Target all your weapons onto the following coordinates.
Fire at my command.
The coordinates you have indicated... do not appear to be a vital system.
Trust me, Data.
They' re standing by.
Fire.
Mr. Hawk, pursuit course.
- Aye, sir.
What?
I hear them.
I have a patient who insists on coming to the bridge.
Welcome aboard, Mr. Worf.
Thank you, sir.
The Defiant.
Adrift, but salvageable.
Little?
We could use help at Tactical.
You do remember how to fire phasers?
Sensors show chronometric particles... emanating from the sphere.
They' re creating a temporal vortex.
Time travel.
Data, report.
We' re caught in a temporal wake.
Captain... Earth.
The atmosphere contains... high concentrations of methane, carbon monoxide, and fluorine.
Life signs?
Population - approximately nine billion.
All Borg.
How?
They went back and assimilated Earth, changed history.
lf they changed history, why are we still here?
The temporal wake... must have protected us from changes in the time line.
The vortex is collapsing.
Hold your course, Mr. Hawk.
We must follow them back... repair whatever damage they' ve done.
Come on.
Good night, Eddy.
Go home.
You' re gonna regret this tomorrow.
One thing you should have learned about me by now... is I don' t have regrets.
Come on, Lily.
Z, you' ve had enough.
I' m not going up in that thing with a drunken pilot.
I sure as hell am not going up there sober.
What is that?
That is the constellation Leo.
That.
It' s an Econ!
After all these years?
We gotta get to the Phoenix.
To hell with the Phoenix.
Report.
Main power' s holding.
According to our astrometric readings... we are in the mid- 21st century.
I estimate we have arrived 10 years after World War ill.
Makes sense.
Most of the major cities have been destroyed.
600 million dead.
No resistance.
Captain...
Mr. Worf, quantum torpedoes.
Fire.
They were firing at the surface.
Location?
Western hemisphere, North American continent.
Looks like a missile complex in Central Montana.
Missile complex...
Data, I need to know the exact date.
April 4... 2063?
April 4th - the day before first contact.
The missile complex must be where Zefram Cochran... is building his warp ship.
That' s what they came to do- stop first contact.
Can' t tell.
Long- range sensors are still off- line.
Data, Beverly, you' re with me.
Have a security team meet us in transporter room three.
Computer, mid- 21st century civilian clothing.
Number One, you have the bridge.
Over here.
They' re all dead.
See if one of them is Cochran.
Data, let' s go check the warp ship.
The structural integrity of the missile appears intact... but there is significant damage... to various sections of the fuselage... and primary intercooler system.
We have blueprints in the Enterprise computer.
Commander La Forge will need to bring a team here -
Hold your fire!
We' re here to help!
Bullshit!
Captain, I believe I can handle this.
Greetings.
Captain, this woman requires medical attention.
Severe theta radiation poisoning.
The radiation' s from the damaged throttle assembly.
- I have to get her to sick bay.
- I' il keep her unconscious.
We need to find Cochran.
Crusher to Enterprise - two to beam directly to sick bay.
Picard to Engineering.
Come with an engineering detail.
We have work to do.
We' re heading to the surface.
Porter, you' re in command till I get back.
And check out the environmental controls while I' m gone.
It' s getting warm in here.
Isn' t it amazing?
This ship used to be a nuclear missile.
It' s an historical irony that Cochran would choose... an instrument of destruction to inaugurate an era of peace.
It' s a boyhood fantasy.
I' ve seen this ship hundreds of times in the Smithsonian... but I was never able to touch it.
Yes.
For humans, touch can connect you to an object... in a very personal way, make it seem more real.
I am detecting imperfections in the titanium casing... temperature variations in the fuel manifold.
It is no more real to me now than it was a moment ago.
Would you three like to be alone?
What have you found out?
There' s no sign of Cochran in the complex.
He has to be here.
This flight was his dream.
We should consider the possibility... that Dr. Cochran was killed in the attack.
lf that' s true... the future may die with him.
What do you think?
The environmental system' s gone crazy.
It' s not just Engineering.
Maybe it' s a problem with the E. P. S. conduits.
Hello?
Hey!
Are you talking to me?
Is anyone else working in this section?
Not that I know of.
Paul?
Are you OK in there?
What is it?
Picard to Enterprise -
Mr. Worf, is everything all right there?
What kind of difficulties?
Humidity levels have risen 73%... and the temperature has jumped 10 degrees in the last hour.
Mr. Data and I are returning to the ship.
Aye, sir.
Damage to her cell membranes is repaired.
She should be fine... but I' d like to run another test on her spinal tissue.
And find out why it' s so hot in here.
Now what?
Crusher to Engineering.
Crusher to Bridge.
Worf, I need to know exactly what' s been happening.
We just lost contact with deck 16 - communications, internal sensors, everything.
Seal off deck 16.
Post security teams at every access point.
Before we lost internal sensors... what were the exact conditions in Main Engineering?
like a Borg ship.
They knew their ship was doomed.
Somehow they transported here without being detected.
Earth.
Picard to Riker.
Enterprise to away team.
Respond.
Main control is being rerouted... through Main Engineering - weapons, shields, propulsion.
Quickly, Mr. Data, lock out the main computer.
It is unlikely the Borg will be able to break it.
The Borg have cut primary power to all decks except 16.
The Borg won' t stay on deck 16.
Come on.
Wake up.
You are all right.
You are gonna be fine.
I need you to do as I say.
It should be.
That' s a girl.
Computer, activate the E. M. H. program.
E. M. H. Please state the nature of the medical emergency.
We need time to get out.
Create a diversion.
This isn' t part of my program.
I' m a doctor, not a doorstop.
Just give us a few seconds.
Borg implants can cause severe skin irritations.
Perhaps you' d like an analgesic cream?
Which way?
We need to get off this deck.
Follow me.
First thing they' il do in Engineering... is establish a collective - a central point from which they can control the hive.
If we fire particle weapons in Engineering... there' s a risk we may hit the warp core.
- Excellent idea.
But the Borg are not entirely organic.
True, but like all cybernetic life forms... they cannot survive without their organic components.
I have ordered all weapons to be set... on a rotating modulation.
The Borg will adapt quickly.
We will be able to fire 12 shots at most.
You may encounter Enterprise crew members... who have already been assimilated.
Believe me, you' il be doing them a favor.
Let' s go.
Deanna?
Deanna!
Don' t turn off that -
Who is this jerk?
Who told him he could turn off my music?
Zefram Cochran.
He a friend of yours?
Yes.
- Husband?
Good.
Now, this, Dina...
Deanna.
This... is the good stuff.
- Dr. Cochran - - Shh!
To the Phoenix... may she rest in peace.
OK... that wasn' t so good.
Will, I think we have to tell him the truth.
- But the time line - - Time line?!
This is no time to argue about time!
We don' t have the time.
- You' re drunk.
Yes, you are.
He wouldn' t talk to me unless I had a drink with him.
Then it took three shots of something called tequila... just to find out he was the one we' re looking for.
I' ve spent the last 20 minutes trying to keep his hands off me.
Sorry.
It' s a primitive culture.
- You' re blended, all right.
He didn' t believe me.
We' re running out of time.
If we tell the truth, do you think he can handle it?
lf you' re looking for my professional opinion... as Ship' s Counselor... he' s nuts.
I' il be sure to note that in my log.
Captain, I believe I am feeling... anxiety.
A most distracting -
I' m sure it' s a fascinating experience... but you should deactivate your emotion chip for now.
Done.
Data, there are times that I envy you.
Are you all right?
Yes, but we have wounded here.
Lopez, get these people to deck 14.
There was a civilian - a woman from the 21st century.
She has no idea what' s going on.
Try to find her.
Lower your weapons.
They' il ignore us till they consider us a threat.
The manual release.
Mr. Worf, hold this position.
Manual release is on- line.
Perhaps we should just knock.
Data.
Ready phasers!
Data, cover me.
Captain, they' ve adapted!
Regroup on deck 15.
Don' t let them touch you!
Captain!
Data!
Here!
Help.
Please, help.
You!
- How did you - - Back off!
- Calm down!
Who are you?
Who are you with?!
I' m not a member of the Eastern Coalition.
I don' t care who you' re with.
Get me out of here.
That isn' t going to be easy.
All right!
Follow me.
Slow!
Your efforts to break the encryption codes... will not be successful... nor will your attempts to assimilate me... into your collective.
Brave words.
I' ve heard them before... from thousands of species across thousands of worlds... since long before you were created.
But now, they are all Borg.
The codes in my neural net cannot be forcibly removed.
You are an imperfect being created by an imperfect being.
Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.
Let me make sure I understand you, Commander.
A group of cybernetic creatures from the future... have traveled back through time to enslave the human race... and you' re here to stop them?
Hot damn.
You' re heroic.
Geordi?
There she is.
Beautiful!
All right, take a look.
Well, well, well.
What we got here?
I love a good peep show.
That' s a trick.
How' d you do that?
It' s your telescope.
That' s our ship, the Enterprise.
And Lily' s up there now?
- That' s right.
We don' t know why yet.
What is it you want me to do?
Conduct your warp flight tomorrow morning as you planned.
Why tomorrow morning?
Because at 11: 00... an alien ship will begin passing through this solar system.
Alien.
You mean extraterrestrials?
Good guys.
They' re on a survey mission.
They have no interest in Earth.
When they detect your ship' s warp signature... and realize humans can now travel faster than light... they decide to alter their course... and make first contact with Earth right here.
Here?
Actually, over there.
It is a pivotal moment in human history.
You make first contact with an alien race... and after you do, everything begins to change.
Your theories on warp drive... allow fleets of starships to be built... and mankind to start exploring the galaxy.
It unites humanity in a way no one thought possible... when they realize they' re not alone in the universe.
Poverty, disease, war - they' il all be gone in 50 years.
But unless you make that warp flight tomorrow morning... before 11: 15, none of it will happen.
And you people, you' re all astronauts... on some kind of star trek.
I know this is a lot for you to take in... but we' re running out of time.
We need your help.
What do you say?
Why not?
It' s pretty bad, sir.
It looks like they control decks 26 up to 11.
But when they took deck 11, they just stopped.
The Borg have assimilated more than half the ship... in a matter of hours.
Why stop there?
What is on deck 11?
Hydroponics, stellar cartography... deflector control.
No vital system.
They wouldn' t stop unless it gave a tactical advantage.
Return to your checkpoint.
Something must' ve happened in sick bay.
Where are Dr. Crusher and the others?
Why did you break the cease- fire?
Who did?
There' s a new faction... that wants to prevent your launch tomorrow morning... but we' re here to help you.
This may be difficult for you to accept... but you are not in Montana anymore.
You' re on a ship - a spaceship - orbiting the earth at an altitude -
You wanna help me, get me outta here.
All right.
You want a way out, here it is.
What is this?
Australia...
New Guinea, the Solomons.
It' s a long way down.
Now, listen to me, I' m not your enemy... and I can get you home.
But first you must put that weapon down and trust me.
Jean- Luc Picard.
What' s yours?
Lily.
Welcome aboard, Lily.
Thank you.
Maximum setting.
If you' d fired this, you would' ve vaporized me.
It' s my first ray gun.
Aah!
Force field.
I' ve never seen that kind of technology.
What?
There' s more I have to tell you.
Are you ready?
Who are you?
I am the Borg.
That is a contradiction.
The Borg have a collective consciousness.
There are no individuals.
I am the beginning... the end... the one who is many.
I am the Borg.
Greetings.
Do you control the Borg collective?
I am the collective.
Perhaps I should rephrase the question.
I wish to understand... the organizational relationships.
Are you their leader?
I bring order to chaos.
An interesting, if cryptic response.
You are in chaos, Data.
A machine who wishes to be human.
Since you seem to know so much about me... you must be aware that I am programmed to evolve... to better myself.
We, too, are on a quest to better ourselves.
Evolving toward a state of perfection.
Forgive me, but the Borg do not evolve, they conquer.
By assimilating other beings into our collective... we are bringing them closer to perfection.
Somehow I question your motives.
That is because you haven' t been properly... stimulated yet.
You have reactivated my emotion chip.
Don' t be frightened.
I am not frightened.
Do you know what this is, Data?
It would appear you are attempting... to graft organic skin onto my endo- skeletal structure.
What a cold description for such a beautiful gift.
Was that good for you?
How many planets are in this Federation?
Over 150 spread across 8, 000 light- years.
You must not get home much.
Actually, I tend to think of this ship as home.
I try to get back whenever I can.
They haven' t broken the encryption code yet.
Who, those bionic zombies you told me about?
The -
Sounds Swedish.
There are 24 decks.
Almost 700 meters long.
It took me six months to scrounge enough titanium... to build a four- meter cockpit.
How much did this thing cost?
The economics of the future are different.
You see, money doesn' t exist in the 24th century.
No money?
You mean you don' t get paid?
The acquisition of wealth is no longer... the driving force in our lives.
We work to better ourselves... and the rest of humanity.
Actually, we' re rather like yourself and Dr. Cochran.
All right.
Come on.
Is there another way around?
I know what I' m doing.
Definitely not Swedish.
What the hell are you doing?
Perhaps something in satin?
And you do understand we have a strict dress code... so if you boys don' t leave right now, I' il -
I' m looking for Nicky the Nose.
He hasn' t been here in months.
This is the wrong chapter.
Computer, begin chapter 13.
Try to look as if you' re having a good time.
Look at me.
Try to act naturally.
There he is.
This is not a good time.
It' s never the time for us, is it, Dix?
I have talk to Nicky.
I' il see you later.
Watch your caboose and dump the broad.
Well, well, well, look what the cat dragged in.
What' s shakin ', Dix?
The usual, martinis and skirts.
No offense.
Ooh!
I think you got him.
I don' t get it.
I thought you said this was all a bunch of holograms.
Without them, even a holographic bullet can kill.
What are you doing?
Every Borg has one.
It' s like a memory chip.
Oh, my.
Jean- Luc, it' s one of your uniforms.
This was Ensign Lynch.
Tough luck, huh?
I' ve got to get to the bridge.
Doctor?
Yeah?
Uh, ahem, yeah.
Ahem.
Tell me if I got it right.
You learned about this in school?
Basic warp design is required at the Academy.
The first chapter is called "Zefram Cochran."
Well, looks like you got it right.
Commander, this is what we' re thinking of using... to replace the damaged warp plasma conduit.
Yeah, Reg, that' s good, but you need... to reinforce this copper tubing with a nano- polymer.
Dr. Cochran, I know this sounds silly... but can I shake your hand?
I can' t tell you what an honor it is to work with you.
Reg!
Right.
Thanks.
Do they have to keep doing that?
It' s just a little hero worship.
To tell you the truth, I can' t say I blame them.
We all grew up hearing about what you did here... or what you' re about to do.
I probably shouldn' t even tell you this... but I went to Zefram Cochran High School.
Really?
What?
Well, you see, in the future... this whole area becomes an historical monument.
You' re standing almost on the exact spot... where your statue' s gonna be.
- Oh, yeah.
It' s marble, about 20 meters tall... and you' re looking up at the sky... and your hand' s sort of reaching toward the future.
I gotta take a leak.
Leak?
I' m not detecting any leak.
Don' t you people from the 24th century ever pee?
Leak.
I get it.
That' s pretty funny.
Excuse me.
Reports of my assimilation are greatly exaggerated.
I found something you lost.
I am a Klingon.
Mr. Worf, report.
We have tried to restore power... to the bridge and weapons systems... but we have been unsuccessful.
I' ve accessed a Borg neuro- processor... and I' ve discovered what they' re trying to do.
It' s a sub- space transmitter.
But in the 21st century... the Borg are still in the Delta quadrant.
Humanity will be an easy target.
Attack the earth in the past to assimilate the future.
Then we must destroy the deflector dish... before they can activate the beacon.
We can' t get to deflector control or a shuttlecraft -
Mr. Worf, do you remember your zero- G combat training?
I remember it made me sick to my stomach.
What are you suggesting?
I think it' s time that we took a little stroll.
There' s a humanoid life sign up ahead.
511 meters.
Cochran?
It' s him all right.
I have remodulated the pulse emitters... but I do not believe we will get more... than one or two shots before the Borg adapt.
Then we must make every shot count.
Magnetize.
Watch your caboose, Dix.
I intend to.
How are you doing, Mr. Worf?
Not well, sir.
Try not to look at the stars.
Keep your eyes on the hull.
Let' s go.
Tell me, are you using a polymer- based neuro- relay... to transit the organic nerve impulses... to the central processor of my positronic net?
If that is the case, how have you solved... the problem of increased signal degradation... inherent to organo- synthetic transmission -
Do you always talk this much?
Not always... but often.
Why do you utilize this primitive communication?
Have you forgotten?
Human.
We used to be exactly like them - flawed, weak, organic.
But we evolved to include the synthetic.
Now we use both to attain perfection.
Your goal should be the same as ours.
Believing oneself to be perfect... is often the sign of a delusional mind.
Small words from a small being... trying to attack what he doesn' t understand.
I understand that you have no real interest in me... that your goal is to obtain the encryption codes... for the Enterprise computer.
That is one of our goals... one of many... but in order to reach it...
Is it becoming clear to you yet?
Look at yourself standing there... cradling the new flesh that I' ve given you.
If it means nothing to you, why protect it?
I... am simply imitating the behavior of humans.
You' re becoming more human all the time, Data.
Now you' re learning how to lie.
My programming was not designed to process these sensations.
Then tear the skin from your limb... as you would a defective circuit.
Go ahead, Data.
We won' t stop you.
Do it.
Don' t be tempted by flesh.
Are you familiar with physical forms of pleasure?
If you are... referring to... sexuality...
I am fully functional... programmed in multiple techniques.
How long has it been since you' ve used them?
Eight years... seven months, sixteen days, four minutes -
Far too long.
We should bring reinforcements.
There' s no time.
It looks as if they' re building the beacon... right on top of the particle emitter.
Once all the transponder rods are in place... the beacon will be activated.
No.
There' s a risk that we hit the dish.
We could destroy half the ship.
We have to find another way.
- Sir?
You still looking for the bathroom?
I' m not going back.
Look, Doc, we can' t do this without you.
I don' t want to be a statue.
- Doctor - - You stay away from me.
We don' t have time for this.
You told him about the statue?
For this to work... all three maglocks will have to be released.
Magnetic constrictors are disengaged.
They' ve adapted.
Warning.
Decompression in 45 seconds.
Hawk!
We' ve had a change of plans, Data.
Assimilate this.
Only got an hour to go, Doc.
How you feeling?
I got a four- alarm hangover... either from the whiskey or your laser beam... or both... but I' m ready to make history.
Riker here.
Go ahead.
Look at that.
You don' t have a moon in the 24th century?
There are 50 million people living on the moon in my time.
Uh- huh.
Don' t tell me it' s all thanks to me.
I' ve heard enough about the great Zefram Cochran.
I don' t know who writes your history books... or where you get your information from... but you people got some pretty funny ideas about me.
You all look at me as if I' m some kind of... saint or visionary or something.
I don' t think you' re a saint, Doc... but you did have a vision, and now we' re sitting in it.
You want to know what my vision is?
Dollar signs.
I didn' t build this ship to usher in a new era for humanity.
You think I want to go to the stars?
I don' t even like to fly.
I take trains.
I built this so I could retire to some tropical island... filled with... naked women.
That' s Zefram Cochran.
That' s his vision.
This other guy you keep talking about... this historical figure?
I never met him.
I can' t imagine I ever will.
Someone once said, "Don' t try to be a great man.
"Just be a man and let history make its own judgments."
That' s rhetorical nonsense.
Who said that?
10 years from now.
You got 58 minutes, Doc.
They' ve taken over decks five and six.
They' ve adapted to every modulation of our weapons.
We have to work on finding another way... to modify our weapons so they' il be more effective.
Sir -
Fight hand- to- hand if they have to.
Aye, sir.
Captain, our weapons are useless.
No!
lf we destroy the ship, we destroy the Borg.
We' re going to stay and fight.
Sir, we have lost the Enterprise.
We are not going to lose her, not while I' m in command.
You have your orders.
I must object to this course of action -
Objection noted.
With all due respect, sir, I believe you are allowing... your personal experience to influence your judgment.
You' re afraid.
You coward.
Jean- Luc!
If you were any other man, I would kill you where you stand.
Get off my bridge.
- What do we do now?
- We carry out his orders.
This is stupid.
If we can get off this ship and then blow it up, do it.
Once the captain' s made up his mind, the discussion' s over.
- You son of a bitch.
OK.
I don' t know jack about the 24th century... but everybody out there thinks that staying here... and fighting the Borg is suicide.
They' re just afraid to come in here and say it.
The crew is accustomed to following my orders.
They' re probably accustomed to your orders making sense.
No one does.
No one can.
What is that supposed to mean?
Six years ago... they assimilated me into their collective.
They had cybernetic devices implanted throughout my body.
I was linked to the hive mind... every trace of individuality erased.
I was one of them.
I have a somewhat unique perspective on the Borg... and I know how to fight them.
Now, if you will excuse me, I have work to do.
I am such an idiot.
It' s so simple.
The Borg hurt you... and now you' re going to hurt them back.
We have a more evolved sensibility.
Bullshit!
I saw the look on your face... when you shot those Borg on the holodeck.
You were almost enjoying it.
How dare you?
- I see it all the time.
- Get out!
Or what?
You' il kill me like you killed Ensign Lynch?
- You didn' t even try!
Where was your evolved sensibility then?
I don' t have time for this.
I didn' t mean to interrupt your little quest.
Captain Ahab has to go hunt his whale.
What?
You do have books in the 24th century?
This is about saving the future of humanity!
No!
No!
I will not sacrifice the Enterprise.
We' ve made too many compromises, too many retreats.
They invade our space, and we fall back.
They assimilate entire worlds, and we fall back.
Not again.
This far, no farther!
And I will make them pay for what they' ve done!
You broke your little ships.
See you around, Ahab.
"felt by his whole race."
"he would have shot his heart upon it."
What?
Moby Dick.
Actually, I never read it.
Ahab spent years... hunting the white whale that crippled him.
Quest for vengeance.
But in the end... it destroyed him and his ship.
I guess he didn' t know when to quit.
Prepare to evacuate the Enterprise.

Enable.
Self- destruct in 15 minutes.
There will be no further audio warnings.
So much for the Enterprise E.
We barely knew her.
You think they' il build another one?
Mr. Worf.
I regret some of the things I said to you earlier.
Some?
I think you' re the bravest man I have ever known.
Thank you, sir.
See you on Gravett Island.
Captain.
Final launch- sequence checks are complete.
Good luck.
Always am.
- I don' t know.
It' s probably nothing.
Begin ignition sequence.
Oh, God!
Now I remember.
- Where is it?
Geordi, we' ve got to abort.
No, wait!
I found it.
Twelve, eleven... ten... nine... eight...
Let' s rock 'n' roll!
Could you turn that down a little?
We' ve got a red light on the second intake valve.
Ignore it.
We' il be fine.
Prepare first- stage shutdown and separation on my mark.
Three... two... one... mark.
OK, let' s bring the warp core on- line.
Oh, wow.
What is it?
Orders to find a quiet corner of North America... and stay out of history' s way.
Well, good luck.
To both of us.
You' re not leaving, are you?
Lily, when I was held captive on the Borg ship... my crew risked everything to save me.
There is... someone still on this ship... and I owe him the same.
Go and find your friend.
What' s wrong, Locutus?
Isn' t this familiar?
Organic minds are such fragile things.
How could you forget me so quickly?
We were very close, you and l.
You can still hear our song.
I remember you.
You were there all the time.
But that ship... and all the Borg on it were destroyed.
You think in such three- dimensional terms.
How small you' ve become.
Data understands me.
Don' t you, Data?
What have you done to him?
Given him what he always wanted- flesh and blood.
Let him go.
He' s not the one you want.
Are you offering yourself to us?
Offering myself?
That' s it.
It wasn' t enough that you assimilate me.
To you.
I' ve overseen the assimilation of countless millions.
- You were no different.
You wanted more than just another Borg drone.
You wanted a human being with a mind of his own... who could bridge the gulf between humanity and the Borg.
You wanted a counterpart, but I resisted.
I fought you.
You can' t begin to imagine the life you denied yourself.
It' s not too late.
Locutus could still be with you... just in the way you wanted - an equal.
Let Data go... and I will take my place at your side... willingly without any resistance.
Such a noble creature... a quality we sometimes lack.
We will add your distinctiveness to our own.
Welcome home... Locutus.
Data, you are free to go.
Data, go.
No.
I do not wish to go.
As you can see, I have already found an equal.
Data, deactivate the self- destruct sequence.
Data, no.
Don' t do it.
Data, listen to me.
Auto- destruct sequence deactivated.
Now, enter the encryption codes and give me computer control.
Data!
Data...
He will make an excellent drone.
Plasma injectors are on- line.
Everything' s looking good.
I think we' re ready.
We better break the warp barrier in the next five minutes... if we' re gonna get their attention.
Nacelles are charged and ready.
Let' s do it!
Engage.
Warp field is looking good.
Structural integrity is holding.
Speed - 20, 000 kilometers per second.
Sweet Jesus!
I' m sure they' re just here to give us a sendoff.
I am bringing the external sensors on- line.
30 seconds to warp threshold.
Approaching light speed.
We' re at critical velocity.
Quantum torpedoes locked.
Destroy them.
Watch your future' s end.
Data!
Resistance is futile.
Throttle back.
Take us out of warp.
Is that Earth?
That' s it.
It' s so small.
It' s about to get a whole lot bigger.
Captain.
Are you all right?
feel.
Strange.
Part of me is sorry she is dead.
She was unique.
She brought me closer to humanity... than I ever thought possible... and for a time...
How long a time?
Zero point six eight seconds, sir.
For an android, that is nearly an eternity.
Captain' s log, April 5, 2063.
The voyage of the Phoenix was a success... again.
The alien ship detected the warp signature... and is on its way to rendezvous with history.
My God... they' re really from another world.
And they' il want to meet the man who flew that warp ship.
Live long and prosper.
Thanks.
I think it' s time we made a discreet exit.
Riker to Enterprise, stand by to beam us up.
You gotta go?
I envy you... the world you' re going to.
I envy you... taking these first steps into a new frontier.
I shall miss you, Lily.
Picard to Enterprise, energize.
Report.
The Vulcans did not detect us.
Recreate the vortex, Commander.
All decks report ready.
Helm standing by.
Mr. Data, lay in a course for the 24th century.
I suspect our future is there waiting for us.
Make it so.
That' s them.
Yeah.
Molly' s the big one.
The little one' s her sister Daisy.
The middle one' s their cousin Gracie.
Well, what about the fathers?
Moved on.
Bring it here.
The next batch.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
There' s two applications for section 63 ex emptions.
Police reports are there.
William Harris is applying for permission to marry.
She' s half- caste also.
And Mary Wilson' s applying for permission to visit her child at Moore River.
She' s quite agitated.
Oh, and Gladys Phillips has written for permission to buy some new shoes.
She had a new pair a year ago.
Er, now, this report from Constable Riggs about three little half- caste girls at the Jigalong fence depot - Molly, Gracie and Daisy.
The youngest is of particular concern.
She is promised to a full- blood.
I' m authorising their removal.
They' re to be taken to Moore River as soon as possible.
Oh, and Miss Thomas, if you could check that the rate for police transportation is still, I believe, eight pence per mile.
Yes, Mr Neville.
Thank you.
That country over there, that' s Wongi country.
You can' t go there.
You get big trouble.
Yeah, I know.
Where your country?
My country?
Down south.
Long way from here.
Our dad works there on the rabbit fence.
Yeah?
How far does rabbit fence go to?
The rabbit- proof fence?
It goes all the way to the sea down that way.
Right to the top of Australia.
Longest fence in the world.
And all the way to the sea down that way.
1, 500 miles long.
Keeps the rabbits on that side of the fence.
Keeps the farmland on this side of the fence.
That Molly' s getting to be a big girl.
Mr Neville' s been writing to me about those girls, you know.
Frankie...
Come on, it' s your turn.
Come and get your rations.
Hurry up.
NO!
This is my kids!
MlNE!
It' s the law, Maude.
No!
Mine!
Move one inch and I' il lock your mother up!
Neville' s their legal guardian.
Get away from us!
Go!
No!
Daisy!
Give me back my Daisy!
You sit up and you stay!
I' ve got the papers, Maude!
Don' t take them!
You' ve got no say in it!
No!
Hear this - don' t move!
Nothing you can do here, old girl!
Nothing you can do.
As you know, every Aborigine born in this State comes under my control.
Notice, if you will, the half- caste child.
And there are ever- increasing numbers of them.
Now, what is to happen to them?
Are we to allow the creation of an unwanted third race?
Should coloureds be encouraged to go back to the black?
Or should they be advanced to white status and be absorbed in the white population?
Now, time and again, I' m asked by some white man,
"will our children be black?"
And as Chief Protector of Aborigines, it is my responsibility to accept or reject those marriages.
Here is the answer.
Three generations.
Half- blood grandmother.
Quadroon daughter.
Octoroon grandson.
Now, as you can see, in the third generation, or third cross, no trace of native origin is apparent.
The continuing infiltration of white blood finally stamps out the black colour.
The Aboriginal has simply been bred out.
Now...... we come to...
We come to the Moore River Native Settlement.
Ladies, most of you are familiar with our work here - the training of domestic servants and farm labourers.
I would like to thank you for your continuing support.
Hundreds of half- caste children have been gathered up and brought here to be given the benefit of everything our culture has to offer.
For if we are to fit and train such children for the future, they cannot be left as they are.
And, in spite of himself, the native must be helped.
Hello, there.
A ghost!
Poor dears.
Such a long way.
You must be exhausted.
Come along - I' il take you straight to the dormitory.
It' s alright.
Come on.
Down you hop.
Come along.
Follow me.
Come along.
Follow me, please.
That' s the way.
Come along.
There' s some beds there.
The bucket' s in the corner.
Hurry up.
Back to sleep, the rest of you.
No talking.
Get up!
All of youse!
Make your beds!
Hurry up!
Irene, Cheryl, stop running around.
Get them blankets tidy.
What' s your name?
Where you from?
You' il get used to it.
Tracker girl, get that bucket.
Take it out now!
What are you standing there dreamin 'about?
Hurry up!
Move!
Get out to breakfast now!
Come on!
Go, all of you!
Come on.
You coming?
Thank you, children.
Ready for our prayers.
Bow your heads.
Eyes closed.
Thank you for the food we eat
Thank you for the world so sweet
Thank you for the birds that sing
Thank you, God, for everything.
There will be no talking.
We' il have no wangka here!
You talk English!
EAT!
Or I' il hold your nose and force it down you!
Here.
Keep still.
We' ve got to scrub you.
Let me see.
Doesn' t that feel better?
Yes, Miss Jessop.
Yes, Miss Jessop.
Thank you, Miss Jessop.
Thank you, Miss Jessop.
That is much better.
Here.
Take it.
Put these on.
Come on.
Get dressed.
This is your new home.
We don' t use that jabber here.
You speak English.
# There' s where my heart is turning ever
What are they doing?
Singing Mr Devil' s favourite song.
Who?
Singing Mr Devil' s favourite song.
Who' s that?
The one on the end, on the chair. #... Ionging for the old plantation
# And for the old folks at home. #
Very good.
Well done.
Tommy Grant.
This way, Tommy.
Here.
Come on.
Stand up straight.
Whoo, hold, boy.
Tommy.
What are they doing now?
They checkin 'for the fair ones.
Why?
They gotta take them to Sister Kate' s.
They' re more clever than us.
They can go to proper school.
No.
Molly Craig.
That you.
Molly Craig!
Go on, get up.
Hurry up, they' il whip you.
Molly, come on, dear.
Get up.
Quick.
Come on, young lady.
Come on.
Just Molly, please.
Where you goin '?
Come back here.
Sit down.
Hurry up.
Come along.
It' s alright.
That' s the way.
Don' t be afraid.
Come along.
Come on, I' m not going to hurt you.
See.
A bit further.
That' s it.
It' s Molly, isn' t it?
I know it all feels very strange, but after a few days you' il feel quite at home.
We' re here to help, and encourage you in this new world.
Duty, service, responsibility.
Those are our watchwords.
Molly, keep still.
It' s alright, it' s alright.
It' s alright.
No.
Over here.
Sweep it over here.
To the door.
Come on, this way.
Push it towards me.
Eh, tracker' s come back.
Eh, tracker girl.
Your dad' s bringin 'Olive back.
Catched her.
Thank you, Moodoo.
Stand there, young lady.
Did you really think you' d get away with it?
Now stop that crying.
See what Miss Doyle has here?
Olive, look at me.
You see this here?
The scissors?
Did she run away home?
She ran away to see her boyfriend.
Come on.
Let' s see if those boys at New Norcia find you so attractive now.
Go.
She broke out through here.
Usual story - off to see her boyfriend at New Norcia.
The tracker brought her back.
Ah, yes, Moodoo.
Mr Neal tells me that your probation period is up, and that you wish to return to the Kimberleys, is that right?
Of course, your daughter is here, isn' t she?
There would be no question of her going.
She would have to stay here and continue her training.
I think for the time being, it would be best for all concerned if you were to remain here, Moodoo.
I' d be prepared to consider your case in a year or so, but, er, until then...
Now, about those little ones from Kalgoorlie.
Those babies - where their mothers?
They got no mothers.
Nobody here got any mothers.
I got mother.
Come on, they' re lining up.
Let' s go.
Bad place.
Make me sick.
These people.
Sick.
Make me sick.
Come on, make your beds!
Nice and tidy!
If you' ve already done it, get to the church now.
Hurry up!
Stop dawdling.
Molly, take the bucket out.
Now, the three of you, go up to the church.
Come on, you kids, get up there, you' re late!
Hurry up!
Now!
Now!
Come on, get your things.
We' re going!
Where we going?
We' re going home, to Mother.
How we gonna get there?
Walk.
We' re not going.
Are we, Daisy?
We like it here.
That tracker, he' s gonna get us and put us in that room.
They' re not gonna get us.
The rain' il cover our tracks.
Come on.
Quick.
Come on.
Now.
Hurry up.
# All creatures great and small... #
Come on, let' s go!
Irene Barton.
Here.
Ellie Moodoo.
Here.
Molly Craig.
Molly Craig?
Molly Craig?
Gracie Fields.
Daisy Kadibil.
Nina, have you seen the new girls?
Haven' t seen 'em all day, miss.
Mr... Mr Neville says you better come real quick.
That' s two days ago, Mr Neal.
Yes, I understand, but I require to be kept fully informed.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Those three girls, they' ve run off.
Oh, dear.
Probably the older one.
I wondered when I saw her.
Too much of their mind...... unfathomable.
The tracker' s onto it.
In the meantime, it must be kept out of the papers.
No rain, tracker gonna get us.
Tracker' s not gonna get us.
Come on.
Come on, Gracie.
Daisy, give me your bag.
Give us your bag, quick.
Give us it!
Hurry up!
In the water, in the water.
We need to cover our tracks.
I see... the emu?
No, that' s not it.
I see the kangaroo.
Red one.
No.
I don' t see nothing.
There' s no food here.
I see...
We don' t know this place.
How are we going to eat?
Shh!
Run!
Quick, hide.
Come on.
Ask them, Molly.
Ask them for something to eat.
Hey, you from that Moore River place, eh?
We' re going home.
Where your country?
Jigalong.
Jigalong?
Proper long way.
Do you know what you' re doing?
That tracker from Moore River...... he pretty good.
I heard he get them runaways all the time.
You' ve got to be good to beat him.
Here.
You watch out for him, eh?
You think you' re so smart.
Where are we?
We' re lost.
North.
The tracker followed them to this riverbank but lost their tracks in the water about a week ago.
There' s been no sign of them since.
Three little half- castes.
We' re talking quite a few man hours here.
Who' s going to pay for it?
There' s very little money in my departmental budget.
I' m hoping your men can combine this with their regular duties.
We' il be able to handle all the notifications, posting police stations, farms...
We' il provide a description.
But if my men make trips outside their duties, it' s an impost on your department, Mr Neville.
If your men are on other jobs, there is no extra expense.
I see that, Mr Neville.
Every one of your men has a role as local protector.
My men will do their jobs, Mr Neville.
Yes.
Hey, Maude.
Your girls have gone.
What did you say?
They' ve run away from Moore River.
They' re gone.
Everybody' s looking for them.
And what do you think you might be up to?
Thieving my eggs, eh?
You come out here where I can see you.
Come on.
Stand up.
Out you come.
And get rid of that bread.
It' s filthy.
You want something to eat, you ask for it.
Come on.
I' m not going to bite you.
Are you on your own?
Hmm?
Got anyone with you?
There you are.
Where are you girls planning on going?
Cat got your tongue, eh?
Go on.
And watch out for those boys further along.
They go out hunting rabbits along the fence.
That rabbit- proof fence?
Yes, the rabbit- proof fence.
East.
Which way now?
That way.
That fence.
Find that rabbit fence, we go home.
Then we see our mum.
"The Chief Protector of Aborigines, Mr A. O. Neville..."
"who a month ago
"ran away from the Moore River Native Settlement."
"would notify him... promptly.
"for a month past, 'added Mr Neville.
"And all the trace we found of them was a dead rabbit." '
It' s the fence!
It' s the fence!
She found it!
Now, the latest sighting which is four days old is...
The man from the newspaper.
I have nothing more to say!
May I have a look?
Dalwallinu.
Yes?
Bunnawarra.
Yalgoo.
Dalwallinu.
Bunnawarra.
Yalgoo.
Dalwallinu, Bunnawarra, Yalgoo.
They' re on the fence.
Right.
Just because people use Neolithic tools, Inspector, does not mean they have Neolithic minds.
This makes our task very much easier.
Look.
There' s a branch off here to the west, north of Yalgoo.
Now, you put your man out here on the fence and north of this junction.
He can start to come down it to meet them.
I' il have Moodoo come up from the south behind them.
We can' t miss them.
Where Daisy?
Wait here.
My legs, Molly.
They hurt.
I can' t walk.
I' il carry you only once, alright?
Come on.
Come on.
Don' t think I' m carrying you all the way.
Camp, Molly.
Damn me.
Where are you girls headed?
Going to Mullewa?
Got family there?
Where Mullewa?
Mullewa?
West.
The way you' re headed along the number two fence.
Are there two rabbit- proof fence?
My oath.
We' ve got three of them.
We' re on the wrong fence.
Where the north fence?
North fence - back that way where you come from.
You can cut across.
I' il show you.
Number one rabbit fence.
Here' s the number two fence.
Now, you' re here.
But you want to be here.
It' s not hard.
I' m going back.
I don' t have the petrol.
Hey, we' re hungry.
Yeah.
What - you girls walk all that way?
Yeah.
800 miles?
I was there.
Too scared to run away, but.
Everyone was always caught, stuck in that boob.
Youse got the furtherest.
Where you heading?
Home.
Mavis!
Stay here.
I' il come back and get you.
Sleep with me.
I' il get you some food.
Just getting the washing, Mrs Evans!
Shh!
What' s that?
There' s someone coming.
Quick, quick, into bed.
Hide under the blankets.
Mavis.
Go away.
Don' t worry about that!
Come on, quick.
Get up.
Get up!
Come on!
Shh, shh, shh.
Don' t go, Molly.
Please don' t go.
He come back if you go.
Don' t go.
He won' t say anything.
Please.
Hello.
Mrs Evans.
Quick!
Wake up.
Wake up.
You got to go.
Let' s have a look.
Out that way.
Just keep going.
They were running out over there about an hour or so ago.
We' il pick up their tracks in the morning.
I' il make a cup of tea.
That' s the tracker.
Yeah, that' s him.
Hop on.
I do not expect you to understand what I am trying to do for these people.
But I' il not have my plans jeopardised.
The problem of half- castes is not simply going to go away.
If it is not dealt with now, it will fester for years to come.
These children are that problem.
Please explain exactly what happened.
I don' t know how they did it, but we lost them.
I had Larsen out there.
Moodoo was with him.
They' re making right fools of us.
They are indeed, Inspector.
And the cost is more than to just our pride.
This department' s reputation is beginning to suffer.
My men have better things to do than chase your charges all around the country.
Now...... they' re coming into very rough terrain.
I can' t risk any of my men.
Yes, we must find them before they reach real desert country.
So this is what we' re going to do.
You get your man up there.
Moodoo can join him.
Well up the fence - around here.
Far enough up so we know we cannot possibly miss them.
And I want them to stay there.
They can set up camp and wait.
Costly.
Well, we' il just have to bear it.
Their lives may be at stake.
Inspector, I understand the mother of one of the girls has gone to Wiluna.
The children are headed into that country.
I want the word spread.
Let' s see what that does.
You wouldn' t get me out there.
She' s pretty clever, that girl.
She wants to go home.
Good thing you kids ran into me.
A lot of people worried for you.
The police are up and down the country looking for youse.
It' s in all the papers.
Which one of you is Gracie?
Are you Gracie?
I hear your mummy in Wiluna.
You can catch a train there from Meeka.
Come on.
Let' s go.
Wiluna - is she at Wiluna?
Yes.
Come on, Gracie.
Don' t listen to him.
He' s a liar.
Maybe she there, Molly.
Maybe he telling the truth.
Molly.
Let' s go to Meeka, catch a train to Wiluna.
If they see us, they' il catch us.
We can' t stop now.
We must keep going.
We' re nearly there.
But, Molly, Mummy there.
She at Wiluna.
I want Mummy.
Come on.
Come on, Daisy.
Come on, Daisy.
You have to carry me, Molly.
Hop on.
She not coming.
Don' t look back.
Don' t look back.
She' il come.
Higher.
You got them?
Three!
One for you, one for me and one for both of us.
Come on, Dais.
We' ve got to go back for Gracie.
Go!
What are you going to do - sell the thing?
I' ve got her!
I want to get the train to Mummy!
This is one of them.
She thinks her mummy' s there.
Gracie.
Grab her!
Hey!
Gotcha!
You' re not going anywhere.
Now, get in that car now.
Thanks, Jacky.
There will be a shilling for you back at the station.
I' m taking you back where you belong.
She gone, Molly?
She not coming back?
Needle in a haystack.
Well, that' s it.
We' re getting out of here.
They' re only paying us for three weeks.
To Constable Riggs, Police Station, Nullagine.
The two missing half- caste girls, Molly and Daisy, are returning to Jigalong via the rabbit- proof fence, our efforts to apprehend them thus far having come to nought.
I therefore expect them to arrive in Jigalong in about a month' s time.
In your capacity as local protector, you are to proceed to Jigalong to await their arrival and effect their recapture.
Yours, etc.
No fence.
I want Mother.
The fence will come back.
Home.
It' s coming through now.
"Riggs arrived Jigalong.
"Awaits your instructions."
Yes, there will be a reply.
Please wait.
"to be accompanied at all times.
"Awaiting notification."
What' s all that about?
Just some women' s business.
Been going on all day.
Hey, Molly.
Yeah?
That tracker, he not going to get us now.
Nah, he' s not going to get us.
I' m not going to stay here.
I can feel it.
They' re up to something.
I' m going to go take a look.
I lost one...... I lost one.
Police Station, Nullagine.
Molly and Daisy.
I would ask to be kept informed of their whereabouts, so that at some future date, they may indeed be... recovered.
We face an uphill battle with these people...... especially the bush natives, who have to be protected against themselves.
If they would only understand what we are trying to do for them.
Yours, etc.
Thank you.
{y: i} Once upon a time {y: i} in a kingdom far, far away, {y: i} the king and queen were blessed {y: i} with a beautiful baby girl.
{y: i} And throughout the land, {y: i} everyone was happy... {y: i} until the sun went down {y: i} and they saw that their daughter was {y: i} cursed with a frightful enchantment {y: i} that took hold each and every night.
{y: i} Desperate, they sought the help {y: i} of a fairy godmother {y: i} who had them lock the young princess {y: i} away in a tower, {y: i} there to await the kiss... {y: i} of the handsome Prince Charming.
{y: i} It was he who would chance {y: i} the perilous journey {y: i} through blistering cold {y: i} and scorching desert {y: i} traveling for many days and nights, {y: i} risking life and limb {y: i} to reach the Dragon' s keep.
For he was the bravest, and most handsome... in all the land.
And it was destiny that his kiss would break the dreaded curse.
He alone would climb to the highest room of the tallest tower to enter the princess' s chambers, cross the room to her sleeping silhouette, pull back the gossamer curtains to find her...
- Princess...
- No!
Oh, thank heavens.
Where is she?
- She' s on her honeymoon.
- Honeymoon?
With whom?
# Can' t stop thinking 'bout it
It' s so good to be home!
Just you and me and...
Shrek!
Fiona!
Aren' t you two a sight for sore eyes!
Give us a hug, Shrek, you old love machine.
How 'bout a side of sugar for the steed?
Donkey, what are you doing here?
Taking care of your love nest for you.
Oh, you mean like... sorting the mail and watering the plants?
- I don' t have any fish.
You do now.
I call that one Shrek and the other Fiona.
That Shrek is a rascally devil.
Look at the time.
I guess you' d better be going.
Don' t you want to tell me about your trip?
Or how about a game of Parcheesi?
Shouldn' t you be getting home to Dragon?
I don' t know.
She' s been all moody and stuff lately.
I thought I' d move in with you.
But Fiona and I are married now.
We need a little time, you know, to be together.
Just with each other.
You don' t have to worry about a thing.
I will always be here to make sure nobody bothers you.
- Yes, roomie?
You' re bothering me.
Oh, OK.
All right, cool.
Me and Pinocchio was going to catch a tournament, anyway, so...
Maybe I' il see y' all Sunday for a barbecue or something.
He' il be fine.
Now, where were we?
Oh.
I think I remember.
- Donkey!
Alone!
I' m going!
I' m going.
What do you want me to tell these other guys?
Enough, Reggie.
"for a royal ball in celebration of your marriage
Mom and Dad?
- Prince Charming?
- Royal ball?
Can I come?
- We' re not going.
- What?
I mean, don' t you think they might be a bit... shocked to see you like this?
But they' re my parents, Shrek.
They love me.
And don' t worry.
They' il love you, too.
Yeah, right.
Somehow I don' t think I' il be welcome at the country club.
They' re not like that.
How do you explain Sergeant Pompous and the Fancy Pants Club Band?
You could at least give them a chance.
To do what?
No!
Oh, great.
Now I need their blessing?
If you want to be a part of this family, yes!
You did!
When you married me!
So that' s it.
You won' t come?
Trust me.
It' s a bad idea.
We are not going!
And that' s final!
We don' t want to hit traffic!
We' il take care of everything.
Oof!
- No.
- Not yet.
- No.
- Are we there yet?
- No!
- Are we there yet?
- Really?
- No!
- Are we there yet?
- No!
- Are we there yet?
- We are not!
- Are we there yet?
- No!
- Are we there yet?
- That' s not funny.
That' s really immature.
- Your loss!
- I' m gonna just stop talking.
- Finally!
There' s no in- flight movie or nothing!
The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey.
That' s where we' re going.
Far, far... away!
All right, all right, I get it.
I' m just so darn bored.
Well, find a way to entertain yourself.
For five minutes...
Could you not be yourself...... for five minutes!
- Yes!
- Oh, finally!
Hey, good- Iooking!
We' il be back to pick you up later!
We are definitely not in the swamp anymore.
You working that hat.
Movie stars!
Well, this is it.
- This is it.
- This is it.
This is it.
Uh... why don' t you guys go ahead?
I' il park the car.
So... you still think this was a good idea?
Mom and Dad look happy to see us.
- I think that' s our little girl.
That' s not little!
That' s a really big problem.
Wasn' t she supposed to kiss Prince Charming and break the spell?
Happy now?
We came.
We saw them.
- They' re my parents.
- Hello?
That was for my own...
Here' s our chance.
Let' s go back inside and pretend we' re not home.
Quick!
While they' re not looking we can make a run for it.
Everything' s gonna be...
A disaster!
There is no way...
- You can do this.
- Really...
- don' t... want... to... be...
Dad...
Shrek.
It' s easy to see where Fiona gets her good looks from.
- Excuse me.
Better out than in, I always say, eh, Fiona?
That' s good.
Don' t tell me you don' t know who I am.
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don' t tell me you don' t know who I am.
What' s happening, everybody?
Thanks for waiting.
- I had the hardest time finding this place.
- No!
No!
Down!
No, Dad!
It' s all right.
He' s with us.
- He helped rescue me from the dragon.
Waiter!
How 'bout a bowl for the steed?
Oh, boy.
- Yeah?
Oh, sorry!
Great soup, Mrs Q.
No, no.
Darling.
So, Fiona, tell us about where you live.
Well...
Shrek owns his own land.
- Don' t you, honey?
- Oh, yes!
What?
I know you ain' t talking about the swamp.
An ogre from a swamp.
How original.
I suppose that would be a fine place to raise the children.
It' s a bit early to be thinking about that, isn' t it?
- Indeed.
- Harold!
- What' s that supposed to mean?
It' s great, OK?
- For his type, yes.
- My type?
I got to go to the bathroom.
- Never mind.
I can hold it.
Oh, Mexican food!
My favorite.
Let' s not sit here with our tummies rumbling.
Everybody dig in.
Don' t mind if I do, Lillian.
Ogres, yes!
Not that there' s anything wrong with that.
No!
Of course, not!
That is, assuming you don' t eat your own young!
Dad!
No, we usually prefer the ones who' ve been locked away in a tower!
- Shrek, please!
- I only did that because I love her.
Aye, day care or dragon- guarded castle.
You wouldn' t understand.
You' re not her father!
It' s so nice to have the family together for dinner.
- Harold!
- Fiona!
- Fiona!
- Mom!
- Harold...
Donkey!
# Your fallen tears have called to me
# So, here comes my sweet remedy
# For her to live life happily... #
Oh, my dear.
Oh, look at you.
You' re all grown up.
- Oh, sweet pea!
I' m your fairy godmother.
- I have a fairy godmother?
Now, don' t worry.
# Wave of my magic wand Your troubles will soon be gone
# Some crystal glass pumps And no more stress
# Your worries will vanish, your soul will cleanse
# Confide in your very own furniture friends
# We' il help you set a new fashion trend
# They' il write your name on the bathroom wall...
# "For a happy ever after, give Fiona a call!"
# A sporty carriage to ride in style, Sexy man boy chauffeur, Kyle
Have a bichon frise! '
# Lipstick liners, shadows blush To get that prince with the sexy tush
# Lucky day, hunk buffet You and your prince take a roll in the hay
# You can spoon on the moon With the prince to the tune
# Don' t be drab, you' il be fab Your prince will have rock- hard abs
Look...
Thank you very much, Fairy Godmother, but I really don' t need all this.
Fiona?
All I got in my room was shampoo.
Oh, uh...
Your husband?
What did you say?
When did this happen?
- But that can' t be right.
- Oh, great, more relatives!
She' s just trying to help.
She can help us pack.
Get your coat, dear.
- What?
- I don' t want to leave.
When did you decide this?
- Shortly after arriving.
- Look, I' m sorry...
No, that' s all right.
I need to go, anyway.
If you should ever need me... happiness... is just a teardrop away.
Thanks, but we' ve got all the happiness we need.
Happy, happy, happy...
So I see.
Let' s go, Kyle.
- What?
I told you coming here was a bad idea.
You could' ve at least tried to get along with my father.
I don' t think I was going to get Daddy' s blessing, even if I did want it.
Sure.
Do you want me to pack for you?
You' re unbelievable!
You' re behaving like a...
Say it!
Here' s a news flash for you!
Whether your parents like it or not...
And guess what, Princess?
That' s not about to change.
Think about that.
That' s real smooth, Shrek.
"I' m an ogre!"
You should.
You started it.
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
Not me.
I think, Harold, you' re taking this a little too personally.
This is Fiona' s choice.
But she was supposed to choose the prince we picked for her.
Fiona does.
And she' il never forgive you if you don' t.
I don' t want to lose our daughter again, Harold.
Oh, you act as if love is totally predictable.
- they were in bloom...
- Our first kiss.
It' s not the same!
I don' t think you realize that our daughter has married a monster!
Fine!
La, di, da, di, da!
Isn' t it all wonderful!
- Hello, Harold.
- What happened?
- Nothing, dear!
Just the old crusade wound playing up a bit!
You better get in.
We need to talk.
Actually, Fairy Godmother, off to bed.
Already taken my pills, and they tend to make me a bit drowsy.
What?
Ha- ha- ha!
So, what' s new?
You remember my son, Prince Charming?
Is that you?
My gosh!
It' s been years.
When did you get back?
I climbed to the highest room in the tallest tower...
Mommy can handle this.
And what does he find?
It wasn' t my fault.
Stop the car!
Harold.
You force me to do something I really don' t want to do.
Hi.
Welcome to Friar' s Fat Boy!
My diet is ruined!
I hope you' re happy.
Er... okay.
Two Renaissance Wraps, no mayo... chili rings...
- I' il have the Medieval Meal.
- No, thank you.
- Sourdough soft taco, then?
- No, really, I' m fine.
Your order, Fairy Godmother.
There you are, dear.
We made a deal, Harold, and I assume you don' t want me to go back on my part.
Indeed not.
- Yes.
- Believe me, Harold.
It' s what' s best.
Not only for your daughter... but for your Kingdom.
What am I supposed to do about it?
Use your imagination.
Come on in, Your Majesty.
Excuse me.
Do I know you?
No, you must be mistaking me for someone else.
Uh... excuse me.
I' m looking for the Ugly Stepsister.
Right.
- Who' s the guy?
- Well, he' s not a guy, per se.
He' s an ogre.
Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.
There' s only one fellow who can handle a job like that, and, frankly... he don' t like to be disturbed.
Where could I find him?
Hello?
Sorry!
I hope I' m not interrupting, but I' m told you' re the one to talk to about an ogre problem?
You are told correct.
But for this, I charge a great deal of money.
Would... this be enough?
You have engaged my valuable services, Your Majesty.
Just tell me where I can find this ogre.
# Everyone says I' m getting down too low
# Everyone says you' ve just gotta let it go
# You just gotta let it go
# I need some sleep
# Time to put the old horse down
# And the wheels keep spinning round
# Everyone says you' ve just gotta let it go #
Dear Knight, I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
Sleeping Beauty is having a slumber party tomorrow, but Dad says I can' t go.
He never lets me out after sunset.
Dad says I' m going away for a while.
Must be like some finishing school.
Mom says that when I' m old enough, my Prince Charming will rescue me from my tower and bring me back to my family, and we' il all live happily ever after.
Mrs. Fiona Charming.
Mrs. Fiona Charming.
No, no.
I was just reading a, uh... a scary book.
I was hoping you' d let me apologize for my despicable behavior earlier.
- I don' t know what came over me.
Do you suppose we could pretend it never happened and start over...
- Please.
Dad.
We both acted like ogres.
Maybe we just need some time to get to know each other.
Excellent idea!
A little father- son time?
I know it would mean the world to Fiona.
Shall we say, 7: 30 by the old oak?
We can' t be lost.
We followed the King' s instructions exactly.
"Head to the darkest part of the woods..."
"Past the sinister trees with scary- Iooking branches."
- The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!
- We passed that three times already!
Oh, great.
Don' t get huffy!
I' m only trying to help.
I know!
I know.
- I' m sorry, all right?
- Hey, don' t worry about it.
I just really need to make things work with this guy.
Yeah, sure.
Now let' s go bond with Daddy.
Well, well, well, Donkey.
What?
I ain' t purring.
Sure.
A hug?
Hey, Shrek.
What do you think I am, some kind of a...
Ha- ha!
Fear me, if you dare!
Look!
A little cat.
- Look out, Shrek!
He got a piece!
- It' s a cat, Donkey.
Come here, little kitty, kitty.
Come on, little kitty.
Come here, little kitty.
I' m coming!
Oh, God.
Shrek!
Hold still!
- Did I miss?
- No.
You got them.
Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from...
Puss... in Boots!
Ah- ha- ha!
- Oh!
That is nasty!
What should we do with him?
Give him the Bob Barker treatment.
Por favor!
I implore you!
It was nothing personal, Senor.
I was doing it only for my family.
My mother, she is sick.
And my father lives off the garbage!
The King offered me much in gold and I have a litter of brothers...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Fiona' s father paid you to do this?
The rich King?
Si.
Well, so much for Dad' s royal blessing.
Don' t feel bad.
Almost everybody that meets you wants to kill you.
Gee, thanks.
Maybe Fiona would' ve been better off if I were some sort of Prince Charming.
That' s what the King said.
Oh, uh... sorry.
I thought that question was directed at me.
Shrek, Fiona knows you' d do anything for her.
Well, it' s not like I wouldn' t change if I could.
I just wish I could make her happy.
"Happiness."
"A tear drop away."
Think of the saddest thing that' s ever happened to you!
Aw, man, where do I begin?
First there was the time that old farmer tried to sell me for some magic beans.
Then this fool had a party and he have the guests trying to pin the tail on me.
Then they got drunk and start beating me with a stick, going "Pinata!!"
What is a pinata, anyway?
I need you to cry!
Don' t go projecting on me.
I know you' re feeling bad, but you got to...
You little, hairy, litter- licking sack of...
Is it on?
This is Fairy Godmother.
I' m either away from my desk or with a client.
But if you come by the office, we' il be glad to make you an appointment.
Have a "happy ever after."
Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?
That' s more like it!
Shrek and Donkey, on another whirlwind adventure!
We' re on the move!
I have misjudged you.
- Join the club.
We' ve got jackets.
On my honor, I am obliged to accompany you until I have saved your life as you have spared me mine.
The position of annoying talking animal has already been taken.
Let' s go, Shrek.
Shrek?
- Shrek!
- Aw, come on, Donkey.
Look at him... in his wee little boots.
Honestly.
- Let' s keep him!
- Say what?
- Oh, so now it' s cute.
- Come on, Donkey.
Lighten up?
I should lighten up?
I should lighten up?
Shrek!
Shrek?
They' re both festive, aren' t they?
What do you think, Harold?
Yes, yes.
Fine.
Try to at least pretend you' re interested in your daughter' s wedding ball.
Honestly, Lillian, I don' t think it matters.
Mom.
Dad.
- Oh, hello, dear.
Right!
Coming.
Mom, have you seen Shrek?
I haven' t.
You should ask your father.
Be sure and use small words, dear.
He' s a little slow this morning.
- Ah, yes!
Mmm!
What do you call this dish?
Ah, yes.
Very good, then.
- Dad?
Dad, have you seen Shrek?
- No, I haven' t, dear.
I' m sure he just went off to look for a nice... mud hole to cool down in.
Oh.
You heard that, huh?
The whole kingdom heard you.
Him?
You know, you didn' t exactly roll out the Welcome Wagon.
Well, what did you expect?
Look at what he' s done to you.
Shrek loves me for who I am.
I would think you' d be happy for me.
Darling, I' m just thinking about what' s best for you.
Maybe you should do the same.
No, really?
That' s the old Keebler' s place.
Let' s back away slowly.
That' s the Fairy Godmother' s cottage.
She' s the largest producer of hexes and potions in the whole kingdom.
Then why don' t we pop in there for a spell?
Spell!
I' m here to see the...
I' m sorry.
Jerome!
Now!
Right away.
Look, she' s not seeing any clients today, OK?
That' s OK, buddy.
We' re from the union.
The union?
Oh!
Oh, right.
Are you feeling at all degraded or oppressed?
Uh... a little.
We don' t even have dental.
They don' t even have dental.
Oh.
I think it' d be better if the Fairy Godmother didn' t know we were here.
Huh?
- Stop it.
- Of course.
Go right in.
A drop of desire.
Naughty!
A pinch of passion.
lust!
- Excuse me.
Sorry to barge in like this...
What in Grimm' s name are you doing here?
Well, it seems that Fiona' s not exactly happy.
And there' s some question as to why that is?
Well, let' s explore that, shall we?
Cinderella.
"Lived happily ever after." Oh...
No ogres!
Let' s see.
Snow White.
A handsome prince.
Oh, no ogres.
Sleeping Beauty.
Oh, no ogres!
No!
Thumbelina?
No.
The Golden Bird, the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman...
No, no, no, no, no!
You see, ogres don' t live happily ever after.
All right, look, lady!
Don' t you point... those dirty green sausages at me!
Oh!
Sorry.
We were just leaving.
Very sorry to have wasted your time, Miss Godmother.
Just... go.
Come on, guys.
Working hard or hardly working, eh, Mac?
Get your fine Corinthian footwear and your cat cheeks out of my face!
Man, that stinks!
You don' t exactly smell like a basket of roses.
- Well, one of these has got to help.
- I was just concocting this very plan!
Already our minds are becoming one.
If we need an expert on licking ourselves, we' il give you a call.
Look.
Make yourself useful and go keep watch.
Puss, do you think you could get to those on top?
No problema, boss.
Ha- ha- ha- ha!
Shrek, are you off your nut?
Keep watch?
Yeah, I' il keep watch.
- What do you see?
- Toad Stool Softener?
I' m sure a nice BM is the perfect solution for marital problems.
- Uh- uh.
- Hex Lax?
Try "handsome."
Hey!
How about "Happily Ever After"?
Well, what does it do?
It says "Beauty Divine."
In some cultures, donkeys are revered as the wisest of creatures.
Especially us talking ones.
Donkey!
That' il have to do.
We' ve got company.
Can we get on with this?
Finally!
A good use for your mouth.
Come on!
Just get this place cleaned up!
And somebody bring me something deep fried and smothered in chocolate!
- Charming.
Sweetheart.
Mama' s working.
Whoa, what happened here?
- What?
Where is he, Mom?
I shall rend his head from his shoulders!
I will smite him where he stands!
He will rue the very day he stole my kingdom from me!
Oh, put it away, Junior!
You' re still going to be king.
Pardon.
Everything is accounted for, Fairy Godmother, except for one potion.
What?
I do believe we can make this work to our advantage.
Maximum strength.
"For you and your true love.
"Happiness, comfort and beauty divine."
- You both will be fine?
- I guess it means it' il affect Fiona, too.
Hey, man, this don' t feel right.
My donkey senses are tingling all over.
Drop that jug o 'voodoo and let' s get out of here.
It says, "Beauty Divine."
How bad can it be?
You' il have a reaction.
And if you think that I' il be smearing Vapor Rub over your chest, think again!
Boss, just in case there is something wrong with the potion... allow me to take the first sip.
It would be an honor to lay my life on the line for you.
Oh, no, no.
I don' t think so.
That' s the best friend' s job.
Now give me that bottle.
How do you feel?
I look any different?
You still look like an ass to me.
Maybe it doesn' t work on donkeys.
- Shrek?
- You drink that, there' s no going back.
- I know.
- I know.
- No more itchy butt crack?
- But you love being an ogre!
But I love Fiona more.
Wait!
I think you grabbed the "Farty Ever After" potion.
Or maybe Fiona and I were never meant to be.
Or maybe Fiona and I were never meant to be.
I feel something coming on.
I don' t want to die.
I don' t want to die.
I don' t want to die!
I' m melting!
It' s just the rain, Donkey.
Things seem bad because it' s dark and rainy and Fiona' s father hired a sleazy hitman to whack you.
It' il be better in the morning.
You' il see...
# Tomorrow
# Bet your bottom... #
Bet my bottom?
Donkey?
Are you all right?
- D- Donkey?
We missed you at dinner.
What is it, darling?
I' ve been thinking about what you said.
Ah!
Excellent!
That' s my girl.
It was a mistake to bring Shrek here.
I' m going to go out and find him.
And then we' il go back to the swamp where we belong.
Fiona, please!
You can' t go anywhere right now.
Fiona!
Look at him!
Quiet.
Look at him.
Good morning, sleepyhead.
Good morning!
- Oh...
- Here, I fetched a pail of water.
Thanks.
A cute button nose?
Thick, wavy locks?
I' m...
I' m...
- Gorgeous!
I' m Jill.
What' s your name?
- Um...
Shrek.
Wow.
Are you from Europe?
- You' re tense.
- I want to rub his shoulders.
- I got it covered.
- I don' t have anything to rub.
Get in line.
- Have you seen my donkey?
- Donkey?
You' re a...
- A stallion, baby!
I can whinny.
I can count.
Look at me, Shrek!
I' m trotting!
That' s some quality potion.
What' s in that stuff?
"Oh, don' t take the potion, Mr. Boss, it' s very bad."
"Warning:
Side effects may include burning, itching, oozing, weeping.
"Not intended for heart patients or those with... nervous disorders."
Senor?
Midnight?
Why is it always midnight?
I' il be your true love!
- I' il be your true love.
I' il be true... enough.
Oh...
And take it from me, Boss.
You are going to have one satisfied Princess.
And let' s face it.
- Easy.... cantankerous, foul, angry ogre you always been.
And you' re still the same annoying donkey.
- Yeah.
Look out, Princess.
Here comes the new me.
- We need to get you out of those clothes.
- Ready?
- Ready!
Oh, God!
I' m blind!
Tell the truth.
Will I ever play the violin again?
You poor creature!
Is there anything I can do for you?
Well, I guess there is one thing.
Take off the powdered wig and step away from your drawers.
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.
Is everything all right, Father?
Thank you, gentlemen!
Someday, I will repay you.
Unless, of course, I can' t find you or if I forget.
# Don' t wanna be a richer one
# Ch- Ch- Changes
# Just gonna have to be a different man
# But I can' t trace time
Tell Princess Fiona her husband, Sir Shrek, is here to see her.
# Every time I thought I' d got it made
# Turn and face the strange
- Shrek? - # Ch- Ch- Changes
# Don' t wanna be a richer one
Fiona?
Hello, handsome.
Shrek!
- Princess!
Wow!
That potion worked on you, too?
What potion?
Shrek and I took some magic potion.
Now, we' re sexy!
Shrek?
- Yeah, you wish.
- Donkey, where is Shrek?
He went inside looking for you.
Fiona!
Fiona!
You want to dance, pretty boy?
Are you going so soon?
Don' t you want to see your wife?
Fiona?
Shrek?
Aye, Fiona.
It is me.
What happened to your voice?
But not the way I feel about you.
Fiona?
- Charming?
Dad.
I was so hoping you' d approve.
Who are you?
- Mom, it' s me, Shrek.
I know you never get a second chance at a first impression, but, well, what do you think?
Fiona!
Fiona!
- Fiona, Fiona!
Ho- ho- ho!
I don' t think they can hear us, pigeon.
Don' t you think you' ve already messed her life up enough?
I just wanted her to be happy.
And now she can be.
Oh, sweetheart.
But look at me.
Look what I' ve done for her.
It' s time you stop living in a fairy tale, Shrek.
She' s a princess, and you' re an ogre.
That' s something no amount of potion will ever change.
I love her.
If you really love her... you' il let her go.
Senor.
What' s going on?
Where are you going?
You wouldn' t have had anything to do with this, would you, Harold?
Just leave the bottle, Doris.
Hey.
Why the long face?
It was all just a stupid mistake.
I never should have rescued her from that tower in the first place.
I hate Mondays.
I can' t believe you' d walk away from the best thing that happened to you.
What choice do I have?
Come on.
Is he really that good- Iooking?
Are you kidding?
He' s gorgeous!
He has a face that looks like it was carved by angels.
He sounds dreamy.
- You know... shockingly, this isn' t making me feel any better.
It' s for the best.
Mom and Dad approve, and Fiona gets the man she' s always dreamed of.
Everybody wins.
I don' t get it, Shrek.
You love Fiona.
And that' s why I have to let her go.
She' s, uh... in the back.
Oh, hello again.
Charming.
You' d better have a good reason for dragging us down here, Harold.
Well, I' m afraid Fiona isn' t really... warming up to Prince Charming.
- No, of course it' s not, dear.
I mean, how charming can I be when I have to pretend I' m that dreadful ogre?
No, no, it' s nobody' s fault.
- What?
- You can' t force someone to fall in love!
I beg to differ.
I do it all the time!
Have Fiona drink this and she' il fall in love with the first man she kisses, which will be Charming.
- Umm... no.
- What did you say?
I can' t.
I won' t do it.
Oh, yes, you will.
If you remember, I helped you with your happily ever after.
And I can take it away just as easily.
Is that what you want?
Is it?
- Good boy.
Now, we have to go.
He' s hopeless.
You need someone to do the back.
Thank you, Mother.
Mother?
A talking horse!
The ogre!
Thieves!
Bandits!
(Announcer) The abs are fab and it' s gluteus to the maximus here at tonight' s Far, Far Away Royal Ball blowout!
The coaches are lined up as the cream of the crop pours out of them
like Miss Muffet' s curds and whey.
And, oh my, the outfits look gorgeous!
Hansel and Gretel!
What the heck are the crumbs for?
And right behind them, Tom Thumb and Thumbelina!
- Oh, aren' t they adorable!
Here comes Sleeping Beauty!
Who is this?
Oh.
It' s the Fairy Godmother!
Hello, Far, Far Away!
Well, you know the rest!
We' il be right back with the Royal Far, Far Away Ball after these messages.
I hate these ball shows.
They bore me to tears.
Flip over to Wheel Of Torture!
I' m not flipping anywhere, sir, until I see Shrek and Fiona.
Whizzes on you guys.
Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing!
Your left!
- Tonight on "Knights"...
- Now here' s a good show!
Requesting backup.
It' s time to teach these madcap mammals their "devil may mare" attitudes just won' t fly.
- Ow!
You capitalist pig dogs!
- That' s not mine.
I' m a donkey!
Tell her Shrek...
I' m her husband, Shrek!
Rewind it!
I' m her husband, Shrek!
Ow!
Ah.
I thought I might find you here.
How about a nice hot cup of tea before the ball?
I' m not going.
The whole Kingdom' s turned out to celebrate your marriage.
There' s just one problem.
That' s not my husband.
I mean, look at him.
Yes, he is a bit different, but people change for the ones they love.
Change?
He' s completely lost his mind!
Why not come down to the ball and give him another chance?
You might find you like this new Shrek.
But it' s the old one I fell in love with, Dad.
I' d give anything to have him back.
That' s mine.
Decaf.
Otherwise I' m up all night.
Thanks.
You' re supposed to say I have the right to remain silent.
Nobody said I have the right to remain silent!
You have the right to remain silent.
What you lack is the capacity.
Shrek?
Donkey?
Too late.
Pinocchio!
Get us out of here!
Tell a lie!
- What should I say?
- Anything, but quick!
Say something crazy like "I' m wearing ladies' underwear!"
I am wearing ladies' underwear.
- I most certainly am not!
It looks like you most certainly am are!
- What kind?
- It' s a thong!
- Are not.
- Are too!
- Are not!
- Are too!
Hey, hey, hey!
Puss!
Pardon me, would you mind letting me go?
- Quit messing around!
We' ve got to stop that kiss!
I thought you was going to let her go.
Boom!
That' s what I like to hear.
It' s impossible!
There' s a moat and everything!
Folks, it looks like we' re up chocolate creek without a Popsicle stick.
- Do you still know the Muffin Man?
Well, sure!
Why?
Because we' re gonna need flour.
Lots and lots of flour.
Gingy!
Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man!
We' ve got a big order to fill!
It' s alive!
To the castle!
No, you great stupid pastry!
Come on!
Down here!
Look at the pony!
Follow the pretty pony!
Pretty pony wants to play at the castle!
Ladies and gentlemen.
Presenting Princess Fiona and her new husband, Prince Shrek.
Shrek, what are you doing?
I' m just playing the part, Fiona.
Mm.
Want to taste?
- Ugh!
What is with you?
- But, Muffin Cake...
C Minor, put it in C Minor.
Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.
Will you honor me with a dance?
Dance!
# To fight the rising odds?
Since when do you dance?
Fiona, my dearest, if there' s one thing I know, it' s that love is full of surprises.
# And I dream of what I need
Hit it!
# I need a hero
All right, big fella!
Let' s crash this party!
- Brace yourselves!
Not the gumdrop button!
# Somewhere after midnight In my wildest fantasy
Go!
After you, Mongo.
More heat, less foam!
# Up where the mountains Meet the heavens above
# Out where the lightning Splits the sea
# I could swear there is someone Somewhere watching me
Donkey!
Puss!
Your lady needs you!
Go!
Today, I repay my debt.
On guard!
# And he' s gotta be fresh From the fight
- # I need a hero # - Stop!
- Shrek?
You couldn' t just go back to your swamp and leave well enough alone.
- Pigs und blanket!
Get the wand!
I see London!
I' m a real boy!
I' m a real boy.
That' s mine!
And Donkey!
Kiss her now!
No!
- Shrek.
Harold!
You were supposed to give her the potion!
- Mommy!
- Mommy?
Ogres don' t live happily ever after.
Oh, Dad!
He croaked.
Dad?
I' d hoped you' d never see me like this.
- Donkey!
No, no, he' s right.
To both of you.
I only wanted what was best for Fiona.
But I can see now... she already has it.
Will you accept an old frog' s apologies... and my blessing?
I' m sorry, Lillian.
I just wish I could be the man you deserve.
You' re more that man today than you ever were... warts and all.
Midnight!
Fiona.
Is this what you want?
- What?
- Because if you kiss me now... we can stay like this.
You' d do that?
- Yes.
To live happily ever after...
with the ogre I married.
Whatever happens, I must not cry!
You cannot make me cry!
Aaah!
You still look like a noble steed to me.
Oh.
I remember.
Uno, dos, quatro, hit it!
Hey gorgeous!
# Living la vida loca #
(Shrieks)
Look to the left.
Paddle!
- Can you see her?
- Mummy!
Hold on!
Christ!
Yes!
- Mummy!
Oh, Jessie.
Yeah!
(Laughs) That was amazing.
- Oh, you girls were screaming.
- All right, Jessie?
- That wasn' t so bad, was it?
- No, it was a piece of piss.
Bitch!
- Bit more, bit more.
- Go on, Paul.
Fish her out.
Got you.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
It' s freezing.
I can' t feel my fingers.
Jessie, Jessie.
Ah, come here.
Oh, babe.
lt wasjust amazing.
Would you like to do that?
Come on, Jessie, it' s freezing.
Let' s go back to the car.
Go with your Daddy.
- I' il just help the girls.
- All right.
It' s OK, you go on.
We can finish up here.
You sure?
Thanks, guys.
I' il see you at the hotel.
See you.
Jess, shall I phone Rachel' s mum?
See if Rachel wants to come to dinner on Thursday?
Yeah?
OK.
When she comes round, she can help us plan your birthday party.
- (Laughs)
Are you OK?
You seem a bit distant.
I' m fine.
Jess?
Jessie!
Jessie!
I' m sorry.
She' s gone.
- I' m sorry.
- No!
No, no.
No, no, no.
Shh.
- (Music changes to gospel) - Well, it' s mud, blood and beer... or sweet Jesus.
Great.
Turn that shite off.
That' s frightening.
Listen, we don' t have to do this, you know.
We can head back and stay in town.
Get wasted, go to a barn dance.
Now that is frightening.
But I' m not going to be the one to tell Juno.
She' s a piece of work, man.
She always brings us out into the middle of...
Well, look at it.
- She came to Scotland last year.
- Yeah, and left pretty quickly.
Sarah!
Beth!
Juno.
You look fantastic.
Ah, come here.
Wow!
Everything is going to be fine.
Better.
It' s going to be great.
Becca and Sam can' t wait to see you.
Why don' t you go in?
- Give me these.
- Yeah.
Thanks.
- OK?
- Yeah, OK.
Ooh, very nice.
- How is she?
- Well, she' s here.
One step at a time, eh?
Hey, hey, hey!
Who are you calling a fucking cheater?
l' m calling you a fucking cheater.
Hello!
Hey!
Hello.
- You do look really good.
- Oh, you look amazing.
- Hey!
- Let me put the bags down.
Oh, so nice to see you.
- We' re starving.
- OK, go, go.
- What have you got?
- Er, well, there' s a bit of...
Sam.
Sam.
Thank you so much for your letter.
It meant a lot to me.
Oh, Sarah, look, I' m so sorry that I couldn' t be there.
You know, mid- terms and...
You know, Sam is going to be Doctor Van Ney in like a year' s time.
No!
- Please tell me it' s longer than that?
- I am so proud of my little sister.
- Who wants a drink?
Me!
- Brandy shot?
- Yeah, yeah.
I hear it all starts falling apart past 25?
ls that what they teach you at medical school, yeah?
To take the piss?
- Ow!
Can anyone make me feel any older?
- Oh, here we go.
- Hello.
- Hi, you must be the teacher.
- Beth, Sarah, this is Holly.
Juno' s protégé.
- I always thought Juno would eat her young.
- Oh, nice.
I' m well able to handle myself, thanks very much.
I' ve heard about you.
You' re that mentalist that jumps off buildings.
- Base jumping.
You should try it, seriously.
- So you live in America now?
Ran out of things to jump off in Galway, you know.
I' m always searching for the next big high.
- Sure you' d know all about that.
- Sorry?
Juno showed me a photo of when you used to climb together.
Ah!
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!
- Look at the state of us!
- Oh, my God.
That' s bad.
Sexy!
Love each day.
Used to be something Paul used to say.
Anyway... cheers.
Here' s to our adventure.
- Cheers.
Come on, light, you bastard.
So, have you done Boreham Caverns before?
I saw it in a book once.
It' s for tourists.
It' s not adventure.
Might as well have hand rails and a fucking gift shop.
lf you' re a caver, jumper, climber..... you just do it and not give a shite.
Or the thing that' s bigger than you will get you.
You want adventure, Holly?
When have I ever let you down?
What?
OK?
- Take this.
- (Chuckles)
What about Josh, Sam?
Are you guys still together?
Sort of.
Different... shifts.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my Jesus!
- What do you think, eh?
Don' t say a fucking word, all right?
It was a Christmas present.
Shut up.
Got a man?
- Oh...
I' m a sports fuck like Juno.
- What?
- Rebecca, too, I think.
But when I' m older, l want to have lots of babies.
Beth, did Sarah tell you that...
Wakey.
Wakey.
I feel like road kill.
Give me five minutes.
Five minutes.
Good morning, my little ones.
Wakey, wakey.
- Good morning.
- ls that what you call it?
It' s fucking freezing!
Holly!
We' re leaving at seven.
Don' t be late.
Try that.
The queen is dead.
Long live... the fucking queen.
Beth, you' re not driving.
- lf you drive we' il never get there.
- Paper, scissors, stone.
- Come on.
- Oh, you' re a dick.
- Go on.
- OK.
- There you go.
- No, wait, babe.
Best of three.
I' il drive.
Right?
Ladies, group photo.
You' d better hurry it up.
We' re running late.
- I look like shit.
- We all look like shit.
Just give me a smile.
- Hat?
No hat?
- No hat.
- No hat, no hat.
- All right.
- Run, run, run, run.
- Say "sausage"!
Sausage!
- Sarah, slow down a bit.
- I' m having fun.
She' s having fun.
Turn, turn, turn there.
- Let' s off road.
- Great.
You should have some water.
Trying to set this watch is impossible.
The buttons are too fucking small.
- Leave it alone.
- Why do you wear it, anyway?
- My boyfriend gave it to me, it' s sentimental.
- It' s fucking mental.
Any guy that gave that to me, I' d dump him.
Juno, are you sure this is the right way?
- Relax, I' ve never been lost in my life.
- Marvellous.
- So have you done these caves before?
- No.
But they are only level two.
Quite safe, don' t worry.
- I wasn' t.
- The only danger is that I might fall asleep.
Boreham Caves.
More like boredom caves.
- Nice parking.
- Thanks.
This one time in Galway. when I free- climbed the cathedral, a priest chased me down the whole of the ground floor.
That was brilliant.
- I shouldn' t have wasted the effort, though.
Holly, shut up.
Rebecca, leave her alone.
OK, guys, let' s get moving.
We' re running late.
Come on, keep up.
Hey, Holly, wait up.
Move it, short arse.
Oi, Carter, get to the back.
Come on, you lazy bastard.
You finally caught up with me.
- Juno, are we there yet?
- There' s a river about half a mile ahead.
When we reach it, we follow it up to the mouth of the cave, OK?
How does she know there' s a river up ahead?
I can' t hear a thing.
She can probably smell it.
She came up here last week to check the route out.
lt' s rule number one - file a flight plan and stick to it.
- And rule number two?
- Don' t go wandering off.
You think it' s dark when you turn out the lights.
Well, down there it' s pitch black.
- You can get dehydration, disorientation...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. -.. claustrophobia...
- Blah, blah... panic attacks, paranoia, hallucinations, visual and aural deterioration...
Hey!
Yeah, lovely, Holly.
A real Kodak moment.
- Don' t touch it.
- You wouldn' t want to piss it off.
- What do you think did that, Sam?
A bear?
What is this?
Nature Detectives?
- It could have been Big Foot.
Come on.
- Sam, stop poking it with a fucking stick.
This is it.
- You' re having a laugh!
- Afraid not.
I' m an English teacher, not fucking Tomb Raider.
You' il be fine.
OK, Sarah, Beth, you' re up next.
Sam, stay with Becca.
Do what she does and you' il be fine.
Holly, safety first.
I don' t want any stunts this time.
- You OK?
See you down there.
- No.
Make sure your cow' s tail is locked there and there.
You hold on to this like that.
Look, I have done this before, you know?
- I' m only looking after you.
- And I appreciate it, in small doses.
You gotta see this place.
It' s beautiful!
You won' t believe this, Beth.
- Oh, shit!
Oh, my God, I' m gonna die.
Ah, piece of piss.
Oh, my God!
lt' s incredible.
(Shouts up) Clear!
It' s Holly.
Shit, move!
OK?
Take it slow and easy.
HOLLY:
- Smart arse.
It' s OK.
They' re gone.
They' re gone now.
Look.
50 bats.
Holly, fuck off.
Which way?
There' s only one way out of this chamber and that' s down the pipe.
OK.
It' s a drop.
Holly, chuck us your bag.
- (Laughter)
(Laughs) Find anything good?
- Jesus Christ!
- Come on, let' s eat.
- Holly, would you take a break?
- I just want to take a few more shots.
This cave is a lot cooler than I thought.
Hey?
Not hungry.
Are you OK?
Juno, I won' t break.
I' m fine.
- I asked you for this.
- I know.
Um, Sarah?
l haven' t had a chance to say that I' m... really sorry I didn' t stay around longer after the accident.
Anyway..... we' re all here for you now, OK?
Yeah.
I' m feeling a bit out of it.
It' s probably jet lag.
- So I' m just going to take a look around, OK?
- Yeah, OK.
Why don' t you try and find us the way through, huh?
Hey, don' t go too far.
What' s up with her?
She looks like she' s seen a ghost.
She' s fine.
I' ve found the next passage!
- That' s it?
It' s a bit small, isn' t it?
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I don' t get this.
- What?
This is not how I imagined it from reading the book.
That' s why I don' t trust books.
Leaves too much room for interpretation.
Something wrong?
- No.
- It' s nothing.
HOLLY: l' m taking point, guys.
Careful.
Just find the way through.
We' il wait here.
Sarah?
- Shit.
- Are you still behind me?
Yes.
Shit!
(Strains with exertion) Shit!
Sarah?
Guys, it' s Sarah, I think she might be stuck.
l am stuck!
BETH:
Calm down, just relax.
I can' t fucking relax.
Fuck, fuck!
Sarah, you have to calm down and the only way you' re going to do that is to breathe.
OK, breathe slowly.
Just keep breathing.
I can' t.
- I can' t fucking breathe.
- Sarah, OK, listen to me.
Just listen to my voice, yeah?
Sarah, I' m coming.
I' m coming back.
OK.
Sarah, OK?
Hey.
Hey, hey.
OK.
- Look here at me, Sarah, hey?
- Help me.
What are you so worried about, Sarah?
Look at me.
Breathe, OK?
Listen to me.
- Listen to me.
What are you so afraid of?
- I can' t fucking move!
You can move.
Sarah, look at me, look at me.
The worst thing that could have happened to you has already happened and you' re still here.
This is just a poxy cave and there' s nothing left to be afraid of, I promise.
OK?
Hey.
Hey, listen, listen.
Listen to me, you' il love this one.
How do you give a lemon an orgasm?
God damn it, let me hear you say it.
How do you give a lemon an orgasm?
What do you do?
(Laughs)
OK, that' s better.
All right, we' re going to move now.
Take hold of my arm, all right?
We' re going to move slowly.
That' s it, grab my arm, OK?
OK, come on.
Just slowly.
Pull on me, OK?
OK, come on.
The rope bag.
I forgot the rope bag.
OK.
OK, fuck the rope bag.
OK, move, now!
Now!
Hurry up!
Sarah, come on!
Sarah, keep hold of the rope!
Sarah?
- Are you OK?
- I' m all right.
JUNO: ls everybody OK? ls everybody OK?
- Don' t fucking touch me.
Rebecca?
I' m here, I' m OK.
Beth, are you injured?
No, I' m fine.
- Nobody move until the dust has settled.
- Don' t worry, Juno, we' re not going anywhere.
You might be right about that.
Jesus.
So what' s the story now?
According to the guidebook, this cave system has three ways out.
This is just one of them.
lsn' t that right, Juno?
Juno, that' s right, isn' t it?
Check the book.
- I didn' t bring it.
- What?
No point.
For Christ' s sake, Juno.
l knew it.
I knew this wasn' t right.
You filed a flight plan to mountain rescue?
lf we don' t report in, they' il come looking for us.
That' s how it' s supposed to work except I put in a flight plan for Boreham Caverns and this isn' t Boreham Caverns, is it, Juno?
We' re in the wrong fucking cave?
Holly was right.
Boreham Caverns was a tourist trap.
- Don' t try and pin this fucking shite on me!
- This is not caving.
This is an ego trip.
Rebecca, I didn' t know this was going to happen.
This is exactly what we believe in.
We said, if there' s no risk, what' s the point?
Don' t try and justify this.
Where are we?
It hasn' t got a name.
It' s a new system.
I wanted us all to discover it.
No- one' s ever been down here before.
- You' re fucking kidding me.
- Oh, God!
How the hell do we get out?
There may not be a way out.
Look, there' s no going back now.
We have to find a way out of this chamber and keep pushing forward.
What the fuck do you think you' re doing?
We all trusted you.
You told me this was going to be good for Sarah.
Have you any idea what she' s been through?
No, cos you couldn' t get away fast enough, you selfish cow.
You know what, Beth?
We all lost something in that crash.
Just get us out of here.
Look, cave systems sometimes break ground.
It' s a small chance.
But if we stay here, we' il die.
Let' s go.
JUNO:
- What?
Don' t move, Sam.
Just don' t move.
Stay right there.
Oh, shit.
No more.
(Falling stone) - Thanks, Beth.
Now I know how far down it is.
So, what now?
One of us has to get all the way across there so they can rig a line for you guys.
I have three cams, I need at least three more.
Where' s the other rope bag?
Where is it?
We lost it, when the cave collapsed.
Sorry.
Help me.
Come on, Becca.
- You got it.
Come on, come on.
Come on, Rebecca.
Come on, Rebecca.
What are you waiting for?
- Fuck.
- Are you OK?
What' s wrong?
It' s nothing.
I' m all right.
OK.
(Gasps) (Breathless) All right, more slack.
More slack, thanks.
Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
JUNO:
Well done.
(Breathless) OK.
Throw me the right rope.
OK.
OK.
Come on.
Yeah!
- Now, you make it look easy.
- Yeah, well, you make it look hard.
Don' t look down, Beth.
Keep going.
- Just keep going.
You' re safe.
Good.
There you go.
Was this about me or you?
It' s about us, getting back to what we used to be.
I wanted us to claim this place, name it.
I thought maybe your name.
Or maybe yours.
You' re doing well.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, give me your hand.
Juno?
We' il need everything we' ve got.
Haul it in.
Fuck.
Reach.
Reach out.
Juno!
No!
Juno, it' s OK, we' ve got you.
OK, pull!
BETH:
Holly, let me pass.
Rebecca, show me your hand.
Let go, let go.
- What does it mean?
- It means we' re not the first.
It' s a piton, right?
lf cavers were here, there' s a better chance of us getting out.
This equipment is at least 1 00 years old.
No- one uses stuff like this any more.
Besides, if anyone had been down here and made it out, they would have named it already.
Becca, are you OK?
I' il live.
Holly, how does it look?
lt' s tight again, but I can get through.
OK, keep going.
We' il be right behind you.
Hey, there' s something down here.
Guys, it' s amazing, but the batteries on our lights will run out.
- So I suggest we keep moving.
- Wait a minute.
Wait.
- What is it, Beth?
- Juno, light up one of your flares.
- We don' t have time for this.
- Just light a flare.
- Really lovely, Beth, but it' s fucking useless.
- No, look at it.
What do you see?
You' ve got the mountain, the cave... and there' s two entrances.
- You are a fucking genius.
- I have my moments.
- This means there' s another way out?
- Let' s find out.
Come on!
- Bastard!
- Which way?
Holly, give me your lighter.
- Come on.
- Here.
Fuck!
Come on!
- Shit!
- That one!
- Hey!
Holly!
Holly, slow down!
JUNO:
Careful!
HOLLY:
I can see daylight!
Holly!
Careful!
Slow down!
Holly, it' s not daylight!
- Help me!
- Hold on!
Guys!
Hold...
Holly!
Sam!
Get down here!
Holly!
Holly!
Holly!
Answer me!
I think I hurt my leg!
Don' t move!
We' re coming down to you.
Oh, fuck!
(Screams) No!
Someone better get down here!
- Oh, that' s fucking disgusting.
Not here, not now!
We need help.
Everybody grab a corner.
We need to move her out of the water.
Nice and easy now.
And... lift!
- You fuckers!
- Juno, find something to make a splint out of.
- It' s OK, I' ve got her.
- Hey, Juno, use one of the ice axes.
You' il be all right, sweetheart.
OK.
- Sarah!
- Juno, I' m gonna need your help here.
- Sarah!
- Juno!
Take hold of her arm.
You' il have to hold her down.
What are you gonna do?
I need to dress the wound and rig up a splint, but I can' t while the bone is protruding.
I need to push it back in.
- I hate you.
- I know.
Do it.
Bite down on this.
- Keep hold of her.
- Just fucking bite down, OK?
- (Screams)
Come on!
Just keep biting down, baby.
Come on.
OK, someone get me a medical kit.
Calm down.
It' il be all right.
- (Gasps) - What are you doing?
I just saw something ahead in the tunnel.
Sarah, I promise you, I' m gonna get you out of here.
But I can' t do it unless you' re with me.
Sarah?
Sarah!
Sarah, look at me.
There' s nothing there.
That' s the best I can do.
It' il hurt like hell and you can' t put any weight on it, but at least you can move.
They combed these mountains centuries ago.
Anyone trapped would be a skeleton now.
- That is just what it looked like.
- What?
- Sarah thinks she saw someone.
- Saw what?
I don' t think I saw someone, I saw someone.
No, you heard something and saw what you wanted to see.
- It' s the dark.
It plays tricks on people.
- I can describe exactly what I saw.
- What did you see?
I saw a man.
Are you sure?
- Yes!
And it' s not the first time.
I thought I saw someone before, but now I' m sure.
Look, if there is somebody down here, then maybe they can help get us out.
Sarah, there' s no- one down here.
Forget about it!
Hey, we have to get Holly out of here.
OK?
This is all that matters right now.
- Beth!
- It' s OK.
ls it?
Fuck!
Fuck me.
You' ve got to keep warm.
Why are we walking away?
There was daylight back there.
It wasn' t.
It was phosphorus in the rock.
We' re two miles underground, the only light down here is ours.
Well, it looked like fucking daylight to me.
Right tunnel!
OK?
(Holly moans)
Jesus!
What is this place?
Holly, where' s the infrared button?
Dead animals.
Hundreds of them.
This is not good, guys.
Can we get out of here?
Which way?
Come on.
- I don' t know.
What do you mean, you don' t know?
There' s no breeze.
It could be any one of these tunnels.
Take your pick.
Oh, fuck it!
Hello!
- Please!
- ls there anybody there?
Hello!
JUNO:
It' s up there!
It' s there on the roof!
Fucking hell, did you see...?
What the fuck was that?
I don' t know!
It moved so fast, I could barely see it!
- I' ve never seen anyone climb like that!
- I told you I saw someone!
- That was not a human being!
- Screw this.
Let' s take our chances and pick a tunnel.
What' s happening?
Oh, shit!
It' s circling us.
- Where is it?
- This way!
Move!
- Holly!
We' ve got to move.
We' ve got to move.
Move it!
Move it!
Let' s go!
- Juno, the flare!
Get rid of it!
- Fuck!
(Holly groans)
Holly!
Holly!
Sarah!
Holly!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Run!
Sarah!
Get off!
Get away, you fucker!
Don' t leave me.
Oh, fuck.
My battery' s gone dead.
Where are they?
What' s happened to the others?
Becca, please say we' re gonna get out of here.
OK.
OK.
Go!
Mummy.
lf you' re really ready...
Oh, fuck.
Fuck.
Turn the light off.
Quiet.
Sarah!
Sarah!
It can' t see us.
Sam?
Becca?
(Echoes)
- Becca!
- It' s Juno.
Becca!
The noise she' s making, she' il bring every one of those things down on her head.
As long as it' s not on mine.
Becca!
Sam!
Sam!
Sam!
Anyone?
Sam!
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
OK.
OK.
OK.
It' s all clear.
Sam, run!
We heard you crying for Sarah.
Where are the others?
They took Holly.
Beth...
Beth' s dead.
Sam..... what is that thing?
I don' t know.
Well, it does look human.
Come on, we need to find the way out before those things find us.
No.
Sam, tell us what we' re fighting.
Well..... they' re totally blind.
And judging from what we' ve seen, I' d say they use sound to hunt with.
Like a bat.
And they' ve evolved perfectly to live down here in the dark.
Whatever they are, they go to the surface to hunt.
And they bring their food back down here to eat, through an entrance.
Listen, if we can stay quiet enough and evade these fuckers..... l think I found the way out.
You think?
The climbing gear we found - whoever brought that down here marked their route.
- I found those markings.
- Well, what are we waiting for?
Sarah.
I' m not leaving without Sarah.
(Gasps) Sarah!
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
No.
Sarah...
I' m getting you out of here.
Don' t touch me.
I heard Juno calling me.
I' m gonna go and find her, and we' re gonna come back and get you out.
No, stay away from her.
- What?
- She did this to me.
- What?
- She left me.
No, she didn' t.
No.
- Shh.
Don' t trust her.
You find your own way out.
It' s OK.
It' s all right.
I' m not gonna leave you, Beth.
I' m not gonna leave you.
I' m not leaving you here, OK?
Beth!
This is Juno' s.
It' s from Paul.
Oh, no.
Sorry.
Oh, that' s them.
Please, come with me.
Please.
Sarah..... don' t leave me like this.
No, please don' t ask me to do that.
- Please.
- I can' t.
I can' t do that.
I can' t do that.
Please.
Ssh.
Close your eyes.
(Screams)
Hurry!
Move!
Sarah?
Sarah?
Sarah?
Look, she' s dead, Juno.
We can' t wait for her.
Come on!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah?
- (Screeching)
Oh, fuck!
Fuck.
- Come on!
- Juno, stop her!
I' il be right behind you!
Sam!
What are you doing?
Come back!
Becca!
You haven' t got enough rope!
Sam!
Turn around!
- What are you doing?
Turn around!
- Sam, baby!
- Sam!
- Sam, turn around.
You can come back.
Please!
Sam!
No!
What are you doing?
Sam!
Sam!
No!
What happened to you?
Rebecca?
What about Beth?
Didn' t make it.
You saw her die?
Come on.
Come on.
No!
Oh, God!
Once in a great while, mankind unlocks a secret so profound... that our future is altered forever.
Fire.
Electricity.
Splitting the atom.
At the dawn of the 31st century, we unlocked another.
It had the potential to change humanity' s role in the universe.
We called it the Titan project, and it was a testament... to the limitless power of the human imagination.
Perhaps that is what the Drej feared most, for... it brought them down upon us without warning... and... without mercy.
Cale, that day, the day the Drej descended from the sky, the only thing that mattered was keeping you safe.
Perfect!
Hey, stop!
- Cale, are you all right?
I' m okay.
Dad, my invention broke.
Well, then, we' il fix it together, but not today, Cale.
We have to go now.
Dad, where' s everybody going?
We' re leaving too.
We all have to go somewhere safe.
Professor Tucker!
The Drej have reached the global defense system!
Come on, son.
Will we get the people away in time?
- Not if we sit here talking, sir.
- I wanna drive.
- When you' re older, kid.
- I' m older than four.
- Hang on!
Whoa!
- Please proceed to your designated - - Is the Titan prepped for launch?
- Just waiting for you, sir!
Let' s pray they' re right!
Enemy warships have entered our solar system.
- Wow!
I have to go on a different ship.
- I have to go away for a while.
No, Dad!
- Tek is going to look after you.
- But I wanna go with you!
- Sir - - I know.
- Sir!
Professor!
Cale, here.
Take this.
As long as you wear it, there' s hope.
- I will see you again.
I promise.
- Okay.
- No, it' s not okay!
It' s not okay!
- Tek, keep him safe!
- Daddy!
- Korso, go!
- Come back!
- Godspeed, Sam Tucker!
This is Tucker.
Bring me down.
Attention, pilots.
Okay.
Now!
Go!
- Get out of there.
- Come on.

Hey, it' s me.
It' s Cale, all right?
- You wait in line, pal.
I' m takin 'the express. - # Cosmic castaway #
- # Yeah # - Go through the docks, you' il get yourself killed.
Coward.
- And that would be the one.
Hey, wh - Hey!
Keep her hot.
I' il be in touch.
- How you doin 'today?
Workin 'hard, are you?
Bon appetit.
Here you go.
- You got ketchup?
You don' t need ketchup.
Move along.
Ketchup!
Boy, some nerve, human.
Nice head, human.
I' m not askin 'that much.
I' d just like them to kill my food before they serve it to me.
- You know, I do an honest day' s work.
I want already dead food.
- Is that too much for a fellow to ask?
- Do you hear a crackling sound?
- And what was up with Chowquin?
- You should' ve seen him.
- Ha- ha, not much chance of that.
Don' t start with that solidarity thing again.
- If you would study human history as you' ve been instructed, you might realize you' re not alone out there, and you' d be better prepared for the future.
- Well, I' il tell you somethin 'about your famous future.
Every day I wake up, it' s still the present, the same grimy, boring present.
I don' t think this future thing exists.
- Do you hear a crackling sound?
- Here we go.
- We gotta get outta this dump.
- Hold on, everybody!
Please don' t panic.
Just think of it as floating time.
Ah.
Just needed some love.
Okay.
Well, I' m full.
- Hey, Cale.
- Firrikash.
Po, how' s it floatin '?
- You pulled a nasty stunt back there.
- We don' t like your attitude.
Up- Up - Is that so?
Well.
I' m gonna have to work on that.
We travel in packs.
- What are you doing?
Yeah?
Well, what for?
Sometimes, kid, people just help each other out.
- Oh, right.
So you' re gonna tell me you don' t want something in return?
Maybe I do.
- What a shock.
I want you to give up everything you have to join the mission, where you' il face terror and torture and possibly gruesome death.
And I would wanna do that because...?
Because... it' s worth it.
Because... the human race needs you.
Maybe you haven' t had a look around lately, but there aren' t many of us left.
- and displaying our bones in alien museums.
- Yeah, well, having your planet blown up can have that effect on a species.
But maybe I' ve been wrong all these years, and it took your inspiring speech to make me see it.
You' ve really changed me.
- Oh, man.
They' ve really ground you down.
- Hey, get this straight.
I don' t even know you.
- and I don' t need your help with these oversized morons.
Oh, okay.
- Whoa!
Captain, this is Akima.
We are not alone.
Are we in good company?
That' s a negative, Captain.
I think we' ve fallen in with a very bad crowd.
Roger that.
Let' s prep for departure.
Tek, I need to be scarce for a while.
- You don' t know the half of it.
Are you still bothering people?
Hey, go away.
Great job with the kid, Tek.
He' s a charmer.
I expected you to take him off my hands a lot sooner.
Who is this?
You know him?
- Joseph Korso.
- I was with your father on the Titan project.
- My father.
- I don' t have a father.
You brought this guy here?
- Yes.
- I don' t understand.
Why?
You still got that ring your father gave you?
- Hey, give it back!
- Cale - - Shh.
Here.
- Put it on.
- How did - How did you - - It' s a storage device.
It' s genetically encrypted to your father, and therefore, to you.
It' s a map, Cale.
It can tell us where your father hid the Titan.
That' s why I' ve spent the last 15 years lookin 'for ya.
Humanity depends on you finding it.
Me?
Me?
No, no, no.
It' s time, Cale.
It' s time to stop running.
- Well, actually,
I think it' s time to start.
Drej.
What do they want?
They want you, kid.
Same way I want you, only dead.
How do you know they want me dead?
We gotta get to the kitchen.
- Korso, the gravity drive!
- You ready?
- Tek, I' il lead you in.
- I' il stay here.
- Tek, you can' t.
Take care of the kid.
He' s not all grown up yet.
- No, no, no, no.
You' re coming.
- Go, Cale.
Follow me!
Whoa!
- Well, this would be good if we had any baking to do.
Oh, my food!
You guys are - You' re terrible.
You' re unsanitary.
Ooh, I hope that they catch you, and I' il testify against you, and you' il never get out of jail.
- Hey, you' il get all the ketchup you want.
- Drej!
Ooh, I gotta go now.
Oh, great.
Yeah, no one would ever think of looking for us in the vent.
Go!
- Go!
Go!
He' s the big - I' m not supposed to be here!
Come on!
I' m just a cook!
How do I get out?
Why is this happening to me?
Stupid - Please - Stupid - No!
Hi.
They went right down there.
They came into my kitchen and -
Bull' s- eye.
We gotta get outta here.
Go!
- Over.
- Huh?
- Maybe next time, kid.
- Hey, I can fly it too.
- It won' t start.
Give it a shot.
Ow!
- Hang on, kid.
Heads up!
- Not going forward.
Going up.
- You should brace yourself.
- Uh, yeah.
Eject.
Hey, where' s the eject?
Cale?
Cale?
This model does have eject, right?
And you were worried.
What do you mean, "were"?
- Akima, we need a pickup here.
- A little late for that.
- I' m right above you.
Can you get to me?
- Not enough time.
Not- Not - Not a lot of time.
- Exhale.
- Exhale.
- Oh, no, no, no, no!
# Comeback down to Earth, oh, yeah #
# Oh, yeah Comeback down to Earth #
- Is it dead?
Can we eat it?
Who are you?
- Hey, what' s going on?
- Preed, you' re in my light.
Ah, such motherly concern for the subject.
- Why am I naked?
- Why, you positively glow with maternal warmth, Akima.
It' s very fetching.
I must have you.
- In your dreams.
- Akrennians don' t dream, remember?
- They don' t bathe much, either.
- I' m still naked here.
I hadn' t noticed.
Now, hold still, or you' il lose something really important.
- Hand me the probe.
- The probe?
Uh, wh- where does the probe go?
Hey!
This is just great.
Cross half the galaxy, nearly get our butts shot off by the Drej, just so we can rescue the window washer.
Hey, for your information, I happen to be humanity' s last great hope.
- I weep for the species.
- You' re fine.
I mean, I' m the guy with the map here.
This is big medicine, right?
Let me see.
This is really it?
This can save us?
Yeah, I guess.
- Do you know what this means?
Um, I' m really wanting those pants right about now.
Korso wants Gune to check the map so we can set a course.
Are we through pawing?
- This is the Valkyrie, not a singles bar.
- We' re done.
You know, I never said I was gonna help you guys.
We never even addressed what' s in it for me.
- Why, you get to be a hero.
- A hero?
I mean, there must be something on the Titan worth selling or trading or -
What?
We' re gonna risk our necks to help a bunch of Drifter Colony bums?
- Where are my pants?
- Guess where Akima grew up.
- Drifter Colony?
- Yes.
The boy learns.
- Wait.
Preed, wait up!
Where' s Korso?
I wanna talk to him.
I believe he' s in Navigation.
We' re headed there now.
- You wanna watch who you' re steppin 'on.
Or you' il what?
- Ah, the lovely and talented Stith.
This is Cale.
- You remember - Cale.
- No, no, no, no, no.
Cannot talk.
We lost targeting on one of our aft gun turrets again!
What?
Think this is a pleasure cruise?
She' s a sweet little thing.
Weapons specialist.
Normally, she' s very good- natured.
Things aren' t bad enough!
- Fight the good fight, precious.
Preed, I' il kill you.
Okay?
I am educated and well- read!
I am not a mechanic!
- I have my pride!
- Gune?
Are you in there?... by the acceleration, multiplied by the coefficient of the friction... and apply necessary force.
- Gune?
- Look at that.
- Does this look familiar?
Do you know what it is?
- Neither do I. I made it last night in my sleep.
- Gune.
- I put a button on it, yes.
I wish to press it, but I' m not sure what will happen if I do.
- Let me see, now.
Three, five, twenty- two, seventy- four,
- eleven -
No- no- no- no.
- It' s perfect.
- Hey.
- Perfect!
You fixed it!
- So, where are we now?
We are here, right here - Bellasan Quadrant.
Why?
Are you homesick?
- Gotta have a home for that.
Translucent bipedal mesomorphic embryonic male.
Yes, yes, yes.
This is all very fascinating, but take a look at this.
- It' s a map.
Can you read it?
- Can I read it?
Hmm.
- So, what do you see?
- Ah!
- Yes, this is Pl' ochda.
- And this - this - this is...
And this - And this - And this - What is this?
- That' s, uh - That' s lunch.
- Mmm.
Spaghetti derivative, meatballs - sort of, anyway - and Caldoch droppings.
- Who ate it before you did?
- Tell you a secret.
This guy' s nuts.
- I' il tell you another.
He' s never wrong.
Where are we going, Gune?
Ahh, the broken moon of Sesharrim.
Only 13, 000 keks away.
- Have Akima lay in a course.
- We' re on our way.
- What' s on Sesharrim, anyway?
- The Gauol, an ancient race.
- Great.
- This isn' t a joyride, kid.
When the Drej destroyed Earth, they figured life adrift in space... would break us down, wipe us out.
Do you really want those vile creatures to be right?
- Just lay down and die?
- A little late.
About 15 years too late to save the humans.
But it' s not like we didn' t have a good run.
It' s about our survival.
See, the Titan was truly visionary, the most advanced ship in the universe.
That ship has the power to reunite the human race, to give us a home.
And the only way to find it is in your hand.
So, you' re really counting on me, then?
- We all are.
I' il show you how much like my father I really am.
I' il leave.
Ahh, no place to set down on the island.
Land on that coral reef.
- Preed, you and Gune watch the ship.
- Watch the ship?
- And keep the engines hot.
- Oh, yes.
They' il be nice and toasty.
- Hmm.
- I' m not keen on the Drej catching me with my trousers down.
Welcome to Planet Sesharrim, Cale.
- It stinks.
- Hydrogen trees.
Hello?
Anybody here?
We' re looking for the Gauol.
Now, what exactly do the Gauol look like?
Don' t know.
They don' t get out much.
We have a kid with a map here that you guys should know about.
I think we know what happened to the Gauol.
- We' il clear a path to the sled.
Everybody ready?
- One, two -
Wait.
No, no.
- I think they are the Gauol.
Ahh.
Quick little devil.
- Yes.
Making progress.
Huh?
Wait, wait.
Hmm.
The moon, the moon, the moon.
Right, yeah.
That' s how we knew to come here.
My father made a map with that moon on it.
Now, why?
Is the ship hidden there?
Ohh.
- Oh.
Hmm.
Ahh.
It must be somewhere in the Andali Nebula.
We did it, kid.
The Titan is as good as ours.
- My father.
Go!
Let' s move it!
- Akima!
- Why aren' t they shooting at Cale?
- They want him alive.
Come on, guys.
Pick it up.
Pick it up.
Pull up!
Preed, come in!
- Hold on!
- Preed, come in!
- Preed!
Preed, Preed, Preed!
Aren' t you supposed to be watching for the Drej?
Yes, caveman, that' s right.
Drej bad.
We good.
- Now, go look at something shiny for a while.
- How' s this?
- Well, you' d better look again!
Drej!
- Aah!
Captain, we' re on our way.
- Look there!
- Akima!
Nice move.
Get down!
Come on.
- Get down!
- Cale!
- I got 'em.
There they are!
- Hang on, Akima!
Don' t shoot!
They' ve got Cale!
Gune, calculate their trajectory.
Stith, take weapons.
- Let' s get on it, people.
- Oh, nice job covering our butts, Preed.
- You' re the weapons expert.
- What were you doing?
Enough!
Okay, the Drej took Cale.
But they are not gonna get away with it.
Well, let' s quit running our collective mouths and go get him.
Our only chance to locate them is to track Akima.
Stith, get on it.
They' re gonna use you to figure out where the Titan is.
Probably just blow it up, too, when they find it.
- Yeah, well, who' s to say it would' ve worked, anyway?
- Who' s to say it won' t?
Maybe Korso will get to the Titan first.
Why do you care so much about that thing?
I was raised around people.
"Drifter Colony bums", I believe, is the term.
I barely remember Earth, but the older ones used to tell us about it... so it would never be completely lost.
No matter how hard things got - and they were hard - those memories kept us going.
Once, we had a home.
The Titan is our chance to find one again.
I guess that' s how I ended up here.
What are they afraid of?
So what did the human race ever do to the Drej?
- It' s not what we did.
- Hmm.
Yeah, well, looks like we' re becoming extinct.
- Cale, you okay?
- Akima!
Cale!
- Cale!
- No!
Stop!
Leave her alone!
No!
Akima' s signal is getting stronger.
I think it' s coming from the slave cages.
- A Drej pod.
What' s in it?
- A human.
- She' s mine.
- Pretty.
Ah.
All right.
- I' il take out the guard.
- Easy, big girl.
This requires cunning and deception.
- Ah.
Uh, I' m an Akrennian trader.
I wonder if we might sneak a peek at the new shipment before they go on the market?
- You' re not allowed.
- Traditionally, no.
You' re absolutely right.
But you see, I need a new slave rather badly.
- Stop fidgeting, worm!
And I can' t wait till auction.
I have to be on the shuttle.
I have an appointment to have my ear shaved.
- You see my problem.
You' re lying.
He' s not a slave, and you' re not traders.
- But - - He doesn' t carry himself like a slave.
Probably ex- military.
Akrennian traders always threaten before they ask a favor.
It' s tradition.
- Ah.
- Hmm.
An intelligent guard.
Whoa.
- This is it.
- Are you in there?
Well, if it isn' t the captain.
What kept you?
Do you see anything?
It was really small, like a cocoon or something.
Nothing like that.
No.
I do see something.
Oh, no.
Just a Drej ship.
Drej!
- What?
Where?
I' m on it.
- Korso, we have a problem.
You' d better get up here.
- I' m here.
I' m here.
- Stith, let' s go.
- I' ve locked on to him, sir.
He' s all alone.
- Three, five, twenty- two -
- Cale!
- Die, Drej scumball!
Oh, don' t - No, don' t shoot.
Oh, guys -
- Come on.
It' s me!
- It' s Cale!
- Stith, hold your fire!
Akima, open the cargo bay.
- Ah!
This is cause for happiness.
So, um - how did you escape?
- He got lucky.
- You know, we were just about to rescue you.
- Yeah?
- Anytime.
- Look, uh, they copied the map.
- I' m sure they' re heading for the Titan now.
They won' t find it.
Stations, people.
Uh, um, what happened?
How' d you get back?
I got picked up with the trash.
Luckily, Korso got there... before I ended up as a door prize in some alien freak show.
I guess I owe him one.
You know, we both got real lucky back there.
- But the next time around - - Cale.
Come on.
Gune needs a hand.
- Yes, it' s very, very clear.
- Gune, what do you make of it?
Hmm.
What?
- Wakeangels.
Why don' t you give 'em a run?
- You sure about that?
Okay.
# It' s my time to fly #
# I' m proving ground tonight #
# I' il try to be the best that I can #
- All right.
Try this, guys.
# It' s my time to fly #
# Ooh #
# We' re right on target #
# It' s my time to fly #
# A chance tonight #
# To victory #
# It' s my time to fly #
# Ooh, I' m right on target #
# It' s my time to fly #
# It' s my time to fly #
# My father will be with me tonight #
# Ooh, we' re right on target #
# It' s my time to fly #
# Ooh #
- Thank you.
No, I mean - I mean, thank you for -
It' s more than my father ever did.
Your father was a great man, Cale.
- He would' ve been proud of ya.
- You really think so?
- Trust me.
Thanks.
Me too.
Akima?
Akima?
Huh?
- In or out?
Oh, uh, in.
Uh, what' s going on?
Do you know why we stopped?
Pit stop for the basics.
Listen.
I need to talk to you, and -
Where' d you get all this junk?
Why don' t you come with me?
I' il show you.
So, we' re gonna barter this stuff for more of that Earthjunk?
Don' t you get it, Cale?
That junk is all that' s left of the place we came from.
Mm, miss.
Like those frozen burritos you were talking about.
- At least they don' t jump off your plate.
You think this is some game?
Did you forget the plan?
I get you the Titan; I get rich.
We had a deal, right?
- How dare you try to cut me out like that?
Do as you please, and guess what.
You' il retrieve nothing.
You don' t have the whole map.
The kid' s got it.
And I' ve got the kid.
So you keep your drones off my back, or so help me, I' il rip his heart out.
Cale, come on.
Going somewhere?
Look what I' ve found: two little birdies itchy to fly.
- How long were they standing there?
- Long enough.
You lied?
Everything you said?
Everything you told me?
Not everything.
Your father hid his ship, then the Drej killed him, all because he couldn' t face the truth.
- Yeah?
What is the truth?
It' s circlin 'the drain.
It' s finished.
No, I don' t believe that!
A fool.
- Cale!
- Akima, come on!
- Stop them.
Stay on 'em.
I' il lock it down.
Go!
- Akima!
We got a ship to find.
Let' s get airborne, now.
- Where' s Cale and Akima?
- They' re not coming.
- Why not?
Afraid?
What exactly are they afraid of?
They' re afraid of what might happen if my command was ever questioned.
- Get it?
- You got a problem with that?
No.
- Why they not say good- bye to Gune?
She needs warmth.
You, go get a doctor.
Hurry.
- Cover her.
- Yes, yes.
- What did you tell him?
I asked him to bring corn liquor.
No.
Ha!
Not for you.
- Me?
- He pass out soon.
- She' il be fine.
Don' t worry.
Hey!
It' s his favorite thing in the world - that stupid ball.
It was our dad' s back on Earth.
Every time he kicks that thing, my brother thinks he' s in a big grass field.
That' s some imagination.
See what I mean?
That' s him - our dad.
That' s where my brother got the idea.
Here on the colony, most people got to shut their eyes... to see anything other than rusted spaceship hulls.
Not my brother.
- Hey.
Sleeping Beauty.
- How long was I out?
Not long.
A few hours.
Korso and Preed.
I can' t believe it.
How long before they reach the Titan?
They won' t.
We' re gonna beat them to it.
Akima, we' re gonna stop them.
'cause, funny, I thought you just said we' re gonna stop them?
- That' s right.
- Cale, we' re in the middle of nowhere.
There' s just the two of us, and, oh, yeah - we don' t have a ship.
- Really?
- Mm- hmm.
- I' d like to see this... ship.
Check it out.
- Oh, no.
Well, she' s been a great house, but I don' t think she' il fly.
Well, she' s still got her ionic vacuum drive.
Those never drain.
- This thing' s a wreck.
- I can fix it, but do you think -
I can fly it.
Good, 'cause we launch yesterday.
# I' ve gotta get away from here #
# It couldn' t be too soon #
# 'Cause I' ve seen the stars for you and me #
# Like rockets to the moon #
# I don' t know what to say #
# I think that maybe I' m in over my head #
# Stuck in the bed somethin 'she said # - Ow!
# Makes me think that I' m in over my head #
# Over my head #
- She' il start.
- Should I get out and push?
Now let me do mine.
These collisions keep slowing us down.
- So where is it?
- My scanners are picking up a veritable cornucopia of... nothing.
Just find it!
Gune, are you sure about that map?
I follow map.
What more can Gune do?
- If Professor Screwloose over there led us off course, I' m going to - - Hold it!
- What is it?
- A ship.
Three keks east.
- Drej?
- No.
Human craft, heading for the break zone.
Moving fast.
- I' d say recklessly fast.
- Akima.
- Ah, good!
Akima.
Cale.
I - I hail on communicator.
No hailing.
Okay.
- If we -
- We' re going to follow them, and we' il run silent.
The reflections are throwing my readings off.
- Cale!
It' s Korso.
- He' s right behind us.
- What?
We' ve got to lose him.
- We' il never find them in there.
- We' re going in.
- Stith, where are they?
- I can' t get a reading.
- Captain.
- Whoa!
A heat signature.
I see them!
- Where are they?
- Behind us!
- No!
Where is he?
I - I don' t know.
- What?
- Well, we found them, Captain.
All gone.
Until they make their move, we stay here.
- They' re moving out, I think.
- Now we' ve got 'em.
They' il see us.
- Maybe that' s exactly what we want.
Yeah.
You' re not gonna get past me, kid.
- There, Captain!
- That' s right, Cale.
Keep coming.
They' re getting closer!
There she is, Captain.
No.
There, Captain.
Which one?
Look!
They' re behind us now!
I need one clear shot.
Don' t lose 'em.
- Ice!
Turn back!
- No way.
- We don' t have a choice.
- Akima!
Uh - - Yes, Cale?
- Pull up!
- Shut up!
Let' s not do that again.
Hold it.
Look there.
Akima, turn around.
Turn around!
Have you ever seen anything like it?
Once.
- What exactly are we looking for?
- This ship' s gonna help us save mankind.
- What exactly are we looking for?
- Not a clue.
DNA coding.
"Mammal.
Tursiops truncatus. "
The bottle- nosed dolphin.
These are animals - or - or they will be.
"Leopard.
Papilio glaucus. "
Swallowtail butterfly.
It' s all here.
- Cale?
- I' m over here!
Look at this.
Dad.
I could never have done anything like this when I was your age.
Hey.
- The Titan.
Quick.
- Ready to go, Captain.
You two stay here.
- But - Here.
Hmm.
N- N- N- N- No.
Those two are becoming a problem.
- We need to take care of it.
I' m one step ahead of you.
- Watch the ship.
I always watch the ship.
- I wanna go!
I wanna go!
- Captain said stay.
It' s Captain I don' t trust.
You know, you may be right.
Come on.
- Stith here.
- Stith, is Gune right there with you?
- Yeah.
- Then please tell him good- bye for me, won' t you?
- What?
- Gune!
I knew it!
- Get out of there!
- Cale.
If this message has been activated, then I have died before finding you.
I hope you can forgive me... for breaking my promise to see you again.
What I wouldn' t give to see you now.
I can' t change the past, Cale, but I hope I can give you a future.
This ship has the power to create a planet, to create a new home.
Your ring would have activated the transformation sequence, but the Titan' s power cells were drained in the escape.
They are unable to fuel the transformation.
It is up to you to restore their power.
After that, the procedure is simple.
- Oh!
Korso, don' t do this.
This ship is all we have left.
Doesn' t that mean anything to you?
Sorry, kid.
World blowing up changes a man.
- Look.
No one can.
They' re pure energy.
Face it, Cale.
You' ve lost.
- Actually, you all have.
Captain, if you' il relieve yourself of your firearm -
- You backstabbing - - Well, I learned from the best.
But it wasn' t just the money the Drej were offering.
It was the health plan that came with it.
They' d let me live provided I kill all of you before they get here.
They should be here shortly.
- Gune?
Gune?
- Gune!
- Gune, are you all right?
- Gune.
- I' il just take a little nap... since I' m so - very sleepy.
Ahh.
- Preed, you can' t trust the Drej.
- Akima.
Oh, stop!
- Captain?
Oh.
- Hide 'n' seek, is it?
- Give me the ring.
- Aw.
You' re not gonna shoot me, kid.
- Cale!
- Ah.
Hold on!
Oh!
I wouldn' t blame you.
I' m not gonna let go!
- Korso!
The Drej!
- You okay?
- No, I think we' re gonna stay right here.
- Right here is about to be blown apart.
- This could be a good thing.
Wait.
- Come on, Cale!
Wait.
We can make this work.
- What did Korso say about the Drej?
- That you can' t beat them.
Because they' re pure energy.
Come on!
I need to get outside.
I - I just need a little time.
- Uh, a few hours!
What can you do in a few minutes?
- Here they come.
- Not if I can help it.
Whoo!
I only have two guns left.
- Let' s make 'em count.
- I' ve got him.
Let' s do this!
- Well, guys, it' s been fun.
- Cale!
- Who' s your daddy?
- Cale, are you all right?
- Stith, who' s outside with Cale?
- Hi, kid.
- It' s Korso!
You' il never get a cleaner shot, Korso.
Maybe we can beat 'em after all.
- Oh, great.
- Ah!
Uh- oh.
We got a problem.
- But the breaker!
- Cale, she' s preparing to fire!
- You can' t stay out here.
Go on.
Get out of here.
Come on.
I know.
Bob.
Oh, so now you' re the boss.
- Well, no, but - - What?
Well, no one said you had to live on Bob.
# Ohh, oh, oh #
# It' s right before your eyes #
- # Although it' s not quite paradise # - # No, oh, no, oh #
# But it sure looks like home #
# Paradise #
# We made it okay #
# And the world just fades away #
- # Okay # - # Oh, oh, oh #
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #
- # Okay # - # Oh, oh, oh #
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #
- # But it' s not quite paradise # - # Oh, no #
# Not quite paradise #
# We' il make this place our own #
# We can rent to own #
# Not quite paradise #
# We don' t have to be alone #
- # Not quite paradise # - # No, no #
# But are we any nearer #
# Listen, do you hear #
# But I #
# I can remember #
# See, it' s me I' m the one #
# to me and you #

# Look around and around #
# People still hanging on #

# And I #
# People still hanging on #
# Andonandonandonandon #
# On andonandonandon #

Hyah!

Howdy, sheriff!
{y: i} Home on the range.
{y: i} Once upon a time, {y: i} I had a home on the range.
{y: i} But not anymore.
{y: i} Well, it' s no use {y: i} cryin 'over spilled milk.
{y: i} Speakin 'of which, that' s me.
{y: i} I' m the cow.
{y: i} Yeah, they' re real.
{y: i} Quit staring.
{y: i} I' m sort of between homes {y: i} right now.
{y: i} I lost my old place... {y: i} thanks to the meanest bunch of {y: i} cattle rustlers in the west... {y: i} Alameda Slim {y: i} and the Willie Brothers gang.
"COWBO Y:" "Ooh- ee"
Somehow, {y: i} they stole the whole herd... {y: i} right out {y: i} from under our noses... {y: i} and then they disappeared {y: i} without a trace.
After that... {y: i} poor old Abner couldn' t {y: i} afford to keep the place... {y: i} or me, either, for that matter.
{y: i} Well, no matter how bad {y: i} things get... {y: i} there' s probably somebody {y: i} worse off.
{y: i} That guy, for instance.
Hey, Maggie.
Take a look at your new home.
{y: i} MAGGlE:
A dairy farm?
{y: i} Now we' re talkin '!
{y: i} Hope it' s not one of them {y: i} fat- free places.
{y: i} K. D. LANG:
{y: i} I know a place {y: i} Pretty as pie {y: i} Out where the river bend {y: i} Hits up {y: i} with the end of the sky {y: i} It' s left of Nebraska {y: i} And over a crest {y: i} On a little Patch of Heaven {y: i} way out west {y: i} Everything' s green {y: i} Know what I mean?

{y: i} There' s room in the nest {y: i} On that little {y: i} Patch of Heaven {y: i} Way out we- e- e- e...
Hey, that' s my boy.
{y: i} PlGGlES:
Can hog!
Don' t yell at me.
The call of duty.
Why don' t you handle this one, Grace?
It' s time I gave you more responsibility on the farm.
Really?
Thanks, Mrs. C. I' il make you proud.
Can hog!
Can hog!
Get off my case, little cocktail wieners!
Whoa, whoa!
I' m sensing a lot of negative energy here.
That' s our can, and Jeb took it.
And now he says it' s his can.
Now, let' s not play the shame and blame game.
This is an organic problem, and there' s a holistic solution.
You don' t get this whole farm concept, do you, sister?
Kill the goat!
- Give it!
- Get the can!
- Ahem.
- We' re sorry, Mrs. Caloway.
Piggies, why can' t you leave Jeb alone?
Yeah!
Why can' t you?
The poor old goat needs peace and quiet.
That' s right!
I need it!
So, run along, and take your can with you.
Yeah, you take that can and...
Hey!
Whoa!
Come back here, you little bacon bits!
Jeb, don' t you have enough cans of your own?
Uh, no, not really.
I' d be happy to take her in, Abner.
There' s always room for one more.
Well, thanks, Pearl.
I gotta warn you, though.
She' s... heh heh... she' s a bit headstrong.
Oh, now, don' t you worry, Abner.
I' m sure she' il fit right in.
So long, Pearl.
You take care, now.
Mrs. Caloway!
Oh!
Mrs. Caloway!
Mrs. Calo...
[Gasps]
Mrs. Caloway, there' s a newcomer at the gate.
- Not now, Audrey.
- But it' s a great big...
Everybody?
This here is Maggie.
Three- time winner {y: i} of the Golden Udder Award... {y: i} and the original {y: i} Miss Happy Heifer.
A show cow?
On Patch of Heaven?
Now, I want y' all {y: i} to make her feel right at home.
You hear me?
Hey, thanks, everybody.
It' s great to be here in Patch of Heaven.
Now, don' t everybody speak at one time.
{y: i} What is this, {y: i} the frozen food section?
Is this thing on?
Ahem.
Good morning, uh, Margaret.
What a wonderful surprise... to find a fellow bovine joining the ranks.
Phony.
- I' m Mrs. Caloway.
- Hi.
- And this is Grace.
- Hi.
No applause and trophies here, I' m afraid.
Just the fruits of our good, honest labor.
Hi.
Workin 'stiffs, huh?
Boy, I remember those days.
Wow!
You' re the biggest cow I have ever saw.
Well, if you' re in charge, I' il take that as a compliment.
- And if you' re not...
I guess I' il just have to sit on you.
Mom!
Hey, I' m only kidding!
Say, what is this you' ve got jammed up in your ear?
Here, have an apple, kid.
Don' t go near any luaus, though.
Wait a minute.
I got somethin 'stuck in my ear.
This one' s for me.
Ahh!
That was good.
Awesome!
Do it again!
Do it again!
Come on, come on!
Do it again!
Do it again!
{y: i} DlLLON:
That' s so cool!
Maggie' s some fun, isn' t she?
Ohh.
Teaching pigs to throw food.
{y: i} As if they weren' t {y: i} sloppy enough.
I' m goin 'long!
Heh heh heh.
Dagnabit, Buck, slow down!
OK, who' s up for a game of tin- can tag?
Hey!
That can is a family heirloom.
Whoever wins is gettin 'a free tetanus shot!
OK?
Superstar comin 'through!
Awesome!
- No autographs, please.
- I got your autograph, pal!
Ow!
Who' s the hotshot?
- Oh, it' s Buck.
- Puh!
City slicker.
SHERlFF:
Whoa!
Dagnabit, Buck!
Take it easy.
This ain' t no rodeo.
Why, good morning, Sam.
Heh heh.
Is that ornery horse gettin 'away from you again?
Oh, uh, howdy, Pearl.
I came out to bring you another bank notice.
This one' il be the last.
You know, every time I get a weak harvest... they send me one of these here notices.
They' il get their money soon enough.
It' s a whole new {y: i} shootin 'match now, Pearl.
{y: i} The bank' s callin 'in {y: i} everybody' s debt.
They' re losin 'money somethin' fierce... {y: i} with all the cattlemen {y: i} goin 'under.
I' m tellin 'you, if they don' t get their money in three days... they' re gonna auction off Patch of Heaven.
What?
No.
But... they can' t take my place.
Why, I' ve been here through twisters, blizzards.
Sam, uh...
Sam, this is my home.
I' m sorry, Pearl.
I' m truly sorry.
Yeah, well...
"sorry" just ain' t gonna save my farm.
Well, Buck, I hope you' re proud of yourself.
As a matter of fact, I am.
Thank you for checking.
You know, Pearl, it don' t have to be this way.
{y: i} You' ve got the best livestock {y: i} in the county.
All you gotta do... is just sell off a few of these critters...
Stop right there, Sam.
They' re family.
You don' t sell family.
Ho- ho- hold your horses, Pearl.
Now you get, before I start using words... no good woman should ever use.
- Don' t bust your gusset, woman!
- Go on, Sam!
It is still my property!
Now get!
I said, get!
I was just tryin 'to help!
That sure took the starch right out of me.
I am sorry, girls.
I' m just plum out of ideas.
Well, I think we all know what happens now.
Well, I think we all know what happens now.
- Uh, Jeb, don' t start.
- Now we all get eaten.
- Jeb?
- What?
What?
You don' t think people in town eat animals?
But who would eat a chicken?
Heh heh.
Come on, guys.
There must be something we can do.
What?
What could we do?
- This just isn' t fair.
- Fair!
Good call, Curly!
- Ollie.
- Ollie.
Uh, what is?
Listen.
What would you say if I told you... that you could win big money... and see beautiful downtown Chugwater... if you went to the County Fair?
Thank you for your input, but...
Come on!
Let the new cow talk!
New cow!
New cow!
New cow!
Come on, Mrs. C. You' ve got a real good- lookin 'bunch here.
{y: i} I see some real potential.
Aw, shucks.
Now, the fair is two weeks away.
I say we go to town, butter up that sheriff' s horse... and get him to give us more time.
What are we waitin 'for, Maggie?
Let' s go.
That' s right.
What do you say, Caloway?
Bah!
Absolutely not.
I will not abandon Pearl in her hour of need... {y: i} for such a ridiculous plan.
She would be devastated if she found us missing.
As far as I' m concerned, that' s not an option.
All right.
Suit yourself.
Come on, Grace.
We' ve got a farm to save.
Oh, you' il have to excuse her.
She' s just a little tense.
Tense.
What' s her specialty, sour cream?
Going to town.
Of all the ill- conceived i...
Now, don' t look at me so crossly.
I know what you' re going to say... {y: i} that Maggie and Grace {y: i} will need someone... {y: i} with my eye for detail... {y: i} to keep them {y: i} on the straight and narrow.
Say no more.
I' il go.
No mushy good- byes, my little ones.
You know how I get about overly emotional displays.
{y: i} Ahem.
Ladies?
Mrs. C.
Well, what made you change your mind?
- I' d rather not talk about it.
- It' s a chick thing.
Good luck, girls!
- See ya!
- Bye!
- They' re stew meat.
- Hurry back!
GRACE, OFF- KEY:
"She' il be" {y: i} comin '' round the mountain {y: i} She' il be comin '{y: i}' round the mountain {y: i} She' il be comin '' round...
'cause I cannot take this much longer.
Maggie, may I be frank?
Only if you let me wear the hat.
Ahem.
Lowbrow remarks may work for you... but we prefer the gentle approach.
Well, she better stick a sock in it soon.
The vultures are starting to circle.
Hey, she' s not dying!
You sure?
{y: i}... no, nothing, {y: i} when she sees Grandma {y: i} No more food for her
We' il keep you posted!
False alarm, Clem!
Roger dodger, out like the wind!
Hey, Maggie, Mrs. C?
How do we find... the sheriff' s office when we get into town?
Elementary, my dear Grace.
If we find Buck, we find the sheriff.
That horse is a legend in his own mind.
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
So, you think you got the drop on me?
Well, think again.
{y: i} Wah!
Wah!
{y: i} Wah!
Yah- hoo!
Hyah!
Haaay!
Jump back!
[Kiss]
{y: i} VOlCE:
Earth to Buck?
Buck!
It' s your move.
Ohh... great.
You were sleep- fighting again.
Almost threw a shoe.
Ohh.
Sorry.
Heh.
It just... it seems like all the other horses... are out there fighting bad guys and takin 'names!
Uhh!
Who put this here?
Oh, Buck, this ain' t no Dodge City... but we get our share of excitement.
Hey, sheriff!
{y: i} Been waitin 'a long time {y: i} to give you this!
Telegram!
Oh, howdy, Morse.
What you got there?
"Got Evil Eye Joe.
Stop.
"Bringing him today.
Stop.
Have money ready.
Signed, Rico. "
Ha!
Oh, yeah!
Rico caught another one already.
Might as well give him the key to my safe.
You hear that, Rusty?
Rico' s comin '.
Yeah, Rico.
I' m old.
I ain' t deaf.
Boy, wouldn' t that be the life?
Ridin 'with Rico, cleanin' up the west.
Kickin 'bad- guy behind!
Wah- yah!
[Kung fu shouts]
All right, girls.
We' re goin 'in.
[Gasps]
There' s no fences.
What keeps the people from roaming?
{y: i} They appear to be domesticated.
It doesn' t feel dangerous at all.
It' s perfectly safe.
Quiet as a farm at milkin 'time.
What was that?
It' s a gunfight!
- Aah!
Hit the dirt!
- Who lives like this?
What do we do?
What do we do?
Look, there' s a star on that door!
That must be the sheriff' s office.
{y: i} Move, ladies!
Move!
{y: i} Swivel your hips, ooh!
{y: i} Give 'em a grind {y: i} Shimmy and shake {y: i} and leave your troubles be...
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- Whoa!
- Get those cows off the stage!
Maybe we came at a bad time.
[Gasps]
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!
- How dare you?
- Oh!
Whoa- oh- oh!
- Daddy?
- Son!
I say!
Aah!
Aah!
Oh!
Ow!
What did I do?
That does it!
{y: i} Hoof it on out of here, ladies!
- Go on!
- Oh, come back!
That was the best dang show we ever had!
Aw, you' ve been on the trail too long, you old coot.
Ohh.
What kind of sheriff' s office is that?
Dancing girls, gambling...
Ha!
How does he ever get any work done?
If that' s the sheriff' s office, this town rocks.
Well, if it isn' t three maids a- milkin '.
You girls a little far from home, aren' t ya?
Well, if it isn' t the phony express.
We want a word with you about this.
- What' s that?
- What is that?
I believe you left this on our farm.
Wai... whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.
The place went bankrupt.
Your farm is history.
Don' t you heifers get it?
Hold on, you two!
Give us two more weeks... and we' il have at least sixty bucks in prize money to...
Ah- ah- ah.
You got three days to pay or get on your way.
And sixty bucks don' t cut it.
[Sniffing]
Seven hundred and fifty of 'em.
But, Maggie, where are we gonna get all that money?
Well, maybe Maggie can just pull it out of her ear.
Hey, watch it, Caloway.
- Rico.
- Rico.
- Rico.
- Rico.
Who is that?
- Sorry.
Don' t you know a hero when you see one, huh?
That' s Rico... the best dang bounty hunter this side of the Pecos.
I could guess from here to tomorrow... but I don' t know how you do it, Rico.
- Mmf!
- Where' s my money?
Well, all right, I got it right here for you.
Hey, they' re giving away free money!
Oh!
Maggie!
So, who else is out there?
The only varmint left... is that low- down, good- for- nothin 'Alameda Slim.
[Gasps]
- What' s the bounty? - $750.
I got it!
Why don' t we go nab that Alameda Slim... and use the reward money to save the farm?
Oh, that is a sensible idea.
I knew you' d love it!
Don' t they have sarcasm where you come from?
It' s perfect!
I' m gonna need a fresh horse.
Hmm, a horse.
A horse.
Let me think.
I reckon you' d want a fast horse, huh?
Real fast?
Course, he' d also have to be able to go... {y: i} for days {y: i} without food or drink... {y: i} stealthy, {y: i} sure- footed in any terrain... {y: i} Well, huh...
- Look at me!
- What about that horse?
What, you mean Buck here?
- Eee!
- Boy, I don' t know.
Buck' s fast, all right, but he' s kind of a handful.
- He' il do.
- Well, suit yourself.
Hey, Rusty!
Rico' s saddle!
I' m wearing Rico' s saddle!
I' m wearing Rico' s saddle!
Great.
I' il leave you two alone.
Ohh, oh, no.
No, no, no.
There is no way in heaven or earth... that cows can catch an outlaw.
Look, all we' ve got to do... is follow this chuck wagon to a cattle drive.
Ahh.
And then, you see... we let the bad guys come to us.
Oh!
We' ve no reason to believe... this chuck wagon is heading off to a cattle drive.
Hey, Tommy!
Have fun on that cattle drive!
All right, then.
Mm- hmm.
I think it is headed toward a cattle drive.
Shh.
We are not following this wagon, and that is final.
Come on, Caloway.
It' il be fun!
- Did you just hit me?
- Kinda.
- Well, stop it.
- Why?
Because I don' t like it.
Oh, no.
Not the hat.
What?
What about the...
All right, all right... violence is not going to solve anything.
Why don' t we all take a deep cleansing breath...
- Yaah!
- Yaah!
Hey, now!
Mud wrestling!
Ha ha!
Hey, hey!
Watch the saddle!
What in tarnation?
I will not be roped into this scheme.
Come on, you crazy heifers!
Come on!
Dagnabit!
Hey, partner, curb your livestock.
{y: i} This town is clean!
Giddy- up!
Ack!
Not exactly what I had in mind, but this' il work.
Well, it doesn' t work for me!
Adios, Buck.
Take care of Rico now.
Hasta la vista, heifers!
Hoo hoo!
{y: i} GRACE, OFF- KEY:
{y: i} Oh, give me a home {y: i} GRACE, OFF- KEY:
{y: i} Oh, give me a home {y: i} Where the buffalo roam {y: i} And the deer... ahem... {y: i} and the antelope pla- a- ay {y: i} Where seldom is heard {y: i} A discouraging word {y: i} And the skies {y: i} are not cloudy all day
{y: i} Home, home on the range
- Sold!
- What was that?
It' s a farm auction, ladies.
[Bang]
{y: i} The final item {y: i} to be auctioned... {y: i} is this piece {y: i} of real property... {y: i} known heretofore {y: i} as the Dixon farm.
{y: i} Do I hear 425?
425!
{y: i} Do I hear 450?
450?
What' s going to happen to the cow who lived there?
She' il be OK.
- How do you know?
- You' re lookin 'at her.
- This was your farm?
- Mm- hmm.
We had, like, a family, too, you know.
- What happened?
- Alameda Slim happened.
Sold to Mr. Yancy O' Del!
Pleasure doing business with you.
{y: i} MAGGlE:
Told ya.
{y: i} You both owe me a dollar.
Step lightly, girls.
The male of the species can be extremely hostile.
Oh, come on, Caloway.
It' s not like they haven' t seen a cow before.
Hey, Barry.
- What?
Huh?
- Check it out.
Ooh, dairy cows!
Oh, hey, how' s it going?
Let me guess.
{y: i} You' re a Taurus.
Look, just keep moving and avoid eye contact.
Pardon me, but what are three lovely ladies like you... doing on a drive like this?
Just ignore them, and perhaps they' il go away.
Oh, they seem like nice guys.
Maybe they can help us.
Why, sure we can help you.
Maybe we can help each other.
- Hmm?
- Hmm?
Look, lover- bull, we' re here strictly on business.
Ooh, sounds pretty exciting.
What kind of business?
We' re looking for a cattle rustler named Alameda Slim.
- Grace!
Shh!
- Grace!
Shh!
Hey, it doesn' t hurt to ask.
Slim?
Oh ho ho ho!
Why, Slim' s just a scary bedtime story... {y: i} to get little calves to behave.
What was that?
It must be Slim and the Willies.
Slim and the Willies?
Don' t worry, darlin '.
I' il protect you.
You have exactly two seconds to remove your hoof... before I snap it off at the knee.
Oh, uh, sorry, ma' am.
I thought you were the blonde.
Ooh!
Come on, girls.
It' s time to lose these ropes.
Where you going?
Hyah!
- Maggie, I' m stuck.
- Look out!
Hahh!
It' s payback time.
- Cover me!
- With what?
- Howdy, Slim.
Quiet, you fools.
We' ve got work to do.
{y: i} Now listen up.
{y: i} There are crooks {y: i} in this here west {y: i} Who have claimed {y: i} to be the best {y: i} And they think they wrote {y: i} the book on how to rustle
{y: i} Well, {y: i} as good as they may be {y: i} Not a one' s as good as me {y: i} And I barely have to move {y: i} a single muscle {y: i} They call me mean, boys {y: i} Depraved and nasty, too {y: i} And they ain' t seen, boys {y: i} The cruelest thing I do
{y: i} You see I {y: i} yodel- adle- eedle- idle- odle {y: i} The sweetest way of rustlin '{y: i} yet devised {y: i}' Cause when I {y: i} yodel- adle- eedle- idle- odle {y: i} Why, looky, {y: i} how them cows get hypnotized {y: i} He don' t prod, {y: i} he don' t yell {y: i} Still he drives {y: i} them dogies well {y: i} Which ain' t easy {y: i} when your chaps are labeled {y: i} X - X- X- X- L {y: i} Yes, if yer lookin '{y: i} from a bovine point of view {y: i} I sure can {y: i} yodel- adle- eedle- idle {y: i} Yodel- adle- eedle- idle {y: i} Yodel- adle- eedle- idle- oo
5, 000 cattle in the side pocket!
Maggie!
Mrs. Caloway!
Snap out of it!
{y: i} A sound that cattle {y: i} truly take to heart {y: i} Yeah, I can {y: i} yodel- adle- eedle- idle {y: i} Yodel- adle- eedle- idel- odle {y: i} And smack my big old rump {y: i} if that ain' t art {y: i} He don' t rope, {y: i} not a chance {y: i} He just puts' em {y: i} in a trance {y: i} He' s a pioneer pied piper {y: i} in ten- gallon underpants {y: i} Yep, I' m the real {y: i} rip- roarin 'deal {y: i} To those who moo {y: i} Thanks {y: i} to my yodel- adle- eedle- idle {y: i} Yodel- adle- eedle- idle {y: i} I got cattle {y: i} out the old wazoo, heh heh!
{y: i} 'Cause I can {y: i} yodel- adle- eedle- idle- oo {y: i} Yodel- adle- eedle- idle- oo
Whoa.
Ho, boy.
Rico, if you' d just been a second earlier... you' d have had that rustler dead to rights.
You boys see anything before I got here?
Yeah, we sure did there, Rico.
We were just settin 'down to supper... when all of a sudden the lights went out.
All right, what part of "cover me" didn' t we understand?
- You guys OK?
- I don' t know.
I feel like I was dreaming.
Yeah.
Slim started singing... and all of a sudden I lost track of everything.
Singing?
That didn' t sound like singing to me.
And, you know, I have perfect pitch.
Grace, about your perfect pitch...
- Not now, Maggie.
- All right, show' s over!
Oh, no.
You' re interfering with official police bidness!
Ha.
Be right with you, big guy.
Buck is on the case.
You know.
Whoo!
Don' t embarrass me in front of my partner.
Please!
You and he are partners?
So, how does that work exactly?
I mean, do you get to ride him on odd days or even?
Hey!
He chose me specifically... because I have skills that are essential... to capturing our quarry.
Ha ha ha!
Whoo!
Smush!
Oof!
You boys headed back to town?
Yes, sir.
We got to go file a report with the sheriff.
Give him back his horse.
This one' s too skittish around cows.
And that, girls, is what makes me and Rico... {y: i} equal parts of {y: i} one lean mean crime- fighting...
Machine?
Well, there it is, then.
Well, well, well, stud.
Now, I' m no professional... but I' d say the only mano a mano you' il be doing... is in your dreams.
Oh, look out, Buck.
He' s making a move on your left flank.
Kaboosh!
Maggie!
Grace!
Leave that poor animal alone.
Buck, I realize you' re very upset... {y: i} but if you' d like {y: i} to join our group... {y: i} and help us bring in Slim, {y: i} we' d be happy to have you.
However, there are a few... anger- management issues we need to discuss.
I wouldn' t help you bossy bovines... if my life depended on it!
You see, that' s just what I' m talking about.
- Grace!
- Bye.
- Come on, girls.
- Hmm.
Let' s go get Slim.
[Lmitates]
"Come on, girls, let' s go get Slim."
Cud- chewing heifers.
I can catch that Slim with one hoof tied behind my back.
[Gasps]
Why don' t I?
Yes!
Partner or no partner, that' s what I' m- a do.
{y: i} Ba ba ba ba ba {y: i} COWBO Y:
Aw, forget it.
Definitely bipolar.
Move it, sister!
Hero passing on the left!
- Hey, watch it.
- Where are you going, hotfoot?
I' m gonna go nab that rustler... and show Rico I got what it takes... so say good- bye to your farm, girls, because Slim is mine.
It' s hero time!
Watch out now!
Get back!
Jump back!
Kiss myself!
Whoo!
{y: i} Da da yoo
Oh, this is a fine kettle of fish.
How can we compete with that?
Look at the bright side, Mrs. C.
Don' t forget about our secret weapon.
Secret weapon?
Who better to catch a cattle thief than a cow?
Yeah, even you can' t argue with that kind of logic.
OK, maybe you can.
You know, Grace...
Maggie does so love your singing.
How about a song?
I' m gonna get you for this.
Ha ha!
5, 000 Texas longhorns.
Not bad for one night' s work.
Pick a color.
I said, {y: i} not bad for one night' s work.
- What?
- Thank you.
And judging by the ear mark...
I' d say these are the last of Big Mike Donald' s herd.
Big Mike Donald had a farm?
- E- l- E- I...
- Ohh...
- Ohh...
That' s right.
He had a farm.
Heh heh heh.
Now that all his cash cows have disappeared... {y: i} that poor sap' s {y: i} gonna be flat broke.
{y: i} Perfect time for a certain {y: i} upstanding land owner... to step in and take all the land.
Aah!
Who are you?
What did you do with Uncle Slim?
Put up your dukes, Mr. Fancy Britches.
Aah- aah- aah- aah- aah- aah!
It' s me.
Hello?
This here is the disguise I use... to sneak into all them auctions... and buy all the land, you brainless monotone monkeys.
Shoot, you got to be the richest land baron in the west.
Yes, but the part that really warms my heart... is watching those homesteaders suffer.
Back in the day, I worked... the highfalutinest ranches you ever seen... but those stuck- up ranch bosses couldn' t appreciate my talents.
Maybe they just didn' t like your singing.
My singing?
Songbirds sing.
{y: i} Saloon gals sing.
Little bitty snot- nosed children sing.
I yodel!
And yodeling is an art!
Well, maybe they just didn' t like your yodeling.
He didn' t mean it, Uncle Slim.
{y: i} Everybody likes yodeling.
Hmm?
Why, it' s one of the funniest, cornball, goofy, silly sounds... in the whole west.
Yaah!
Aah!
Yaah!
- Uh, Gil?
- Uh- huh?
Am I correct in assuming that each and every time... we brought a herd back to this secret lair... you' ve managed to sit in the exact same spot... blocking that choice piece of property from my view?!
This is my comfy place.
What?
Aah!
It' s called {y: i} Patch of Heaven, Uncle Slim.
Goes on auction Thursday morning.
Perfect.
Pencil it in.
Thursday morning... right after we sell off this herd.
But it' s just a little old dirt farm.
Ah, what' s the difference?
When you' re talking revenge, every last acre counts.
I don' t get it.
Weren' t the cows supposed to come back?
Daddy, what' s going to happen if they don' t come back?
Oh, but they are coming back.
Hogwash!
We all know they' re never coming back.
[Clucks]
What?
Ooh!
You don' t know that, Jeb.
Everybody knows that bovines... are the most intelligent, crafty animals in the west.
Yeah.
He' s right, you know.
It doesn' t take a cow to figure out... they saw the writing on the wall... and flown the coop while the getting was good.
What?
Oh, no!
They tricked us and deserted us!
Aud- Audrey.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
Oh, uh, let' s not forget who we' re talkin '' bout.
Audrey, remember when Grace helped you figure out... {y: i} why you crossed the road?
And, Jeb, Miss Caloway knew just what to do... when your head got stuck in that spittoon.
Get off my case!
And Maggie was gonna make us all winners.
I truly believe there ain' t nothin '... those three cows can' t do.
Well, whatever they' re gonna do, they better do it soon.
I' m so very sorry, Pearl.
It' s a real shame.
It is.
Ollie, I don' t know what' s worse...
losing my farm to the highest bidder... or knowing that... that my girls are lost and alone out there.
- Yee- haw!
- Come on, girls.
Either I' m getting good at this... or his scent is getting stronger.
Go get him, Maggie.
Look out, Slim!
- No.
It can' t be.
- We' re on your trail!
Hoo hoo!
This has Buck {y: i} written all over it.
We' re not gonna let this dumb old trick stop us.
Sooner or later, all these paths will hook up, and then...
Oh, no, the tracks!
Hurry up, girls.
Don' t lose that trail.
What trail?
I can' t see anything.
Look out!
Oh!
Flash flood!
Get to high ground!
- Oh.
- Maggie!
Maggie!
[Coughs]
Come on, girls, we can' t give up!
Maggie, that' s enough.
The minute this lets up... we' re heading straight home to Patch of Heaven.
But what about catching Slim and collecting the reward?
We never had a prayer... of catching Slim in the first place.
{y: i} This whole ridiculous plan... is just so you can get revenge on those cattle rustlers.
Hey!
For your information, duchess... this whole ridiculous plan is about us saving our farm.
Huh.
Our farm might' ve had a fighting chance... until you came along.
What' s that supposed to mean?
Strutting around with your vulgar show- cow behavior.
Look, I was just having... {y: i} Wasting our time {y: i} on your foolish plans.
Through the years, Patch of Heaven... has survived every hardship that nature can dish out... but you, Maggie... are the biggest catastrophe to ever hit our farm.
Well, if that' s the way you feel about it... maybe we should just go our separate ways.
Now, that' s the first good idea you' ve ever had.
- Fine!
- Fine!
- Fine!
- Fine!
Yeah.
Fine.
It' s not like your farm... was ever gonna feel like home to me anyways.
{y: i} BONNlE RAlTT:
{y: i} Rain is pourin 'down {y: i} Like the heavens {y: i} are hurtin' {y: i} Seems like it' s been dark {y: i} since the devil knows when {y: i} How do you go on {y: i} never knowing for certain {y: i} Will the sun {y: i} ever shine again?
{y: i} Feels like it' s been years {y: i} since it started to thunder {y: i} Clouds are campin 'out {y: i} in the valley and glen {y: i} How do you go on when {y: i} you can' t help but wonder {y: i} Will the sun {y: i} ever shine again?
{y: i} What if the rain {y: i} keeps fallin '?
{y: i} What if the sky {y: i} stays gray?
{y: i} What if the winds {y: i} keep squallin '{y: i} And never go away?
{y: i} Maybe soon the storm {y: i} will be tired of blowin '{y: i} Maybe soon {y: i} it all will be over, amen {y: i} How do you go on if {y: i} there' s no way of knowin'?
{y: i} Will the sun ever shine?
{y: i} Wish I could say
{y: i} Send me a sign {y: i} One little ray {y: i} Lord, {y: i} if you' re listenin '{y: i} How long until then?
{y: i} Will the sun ever shine {y: i} Again?
Maggie.
Maggie.
Maggie.
- Wake up.
- Check, please!
It tasted a lot better in my sleep.
Well, I suppose you' il be off now.
- Mm- hmm.
- Where will you go?
Oh, probably check out the Grand Canyon.
See Utah before I die.
Wait a minute.
Where' s Grace?
Hi, there.
Boy, am I glad you guys are up.
Hey, come look at this.
What on earth?
Where did all this come from?
Hey, it' s green, it' s leafy, and it' s free.
Shut up and eat.
Good morning, ladies.
I see you' re already tucked into your appetizer.
Never knew a pretty lady that didn' t have an appetite.
Oh, now, see here, you ruffian...
He' s not a ruffian, Mrs. Caloway.
He' s a genuine desert shaman... our very own wise man.
Shaman, chef, chief cook, and bottle washer.
I' m a jackrabbit of all trades and at your service.
Folks around these parts call me Lucky Jack.
Yep, they used to come from miles around... just to get one rub of my lucky rabbit' s foot.
Whoo!
Dagnabit!
This happens all the time.
Now, where was I?
Ah.
Voila.
{y: i} Now let me just {y: i} get this on the fire... and it' il be ready directly.
Mm- huh.
Ow!
Yow!
Look, we don' t eat meat.
It' s kind of like a professional courtesy.
Perhaps we' il dine with you some other time.
You see, Grace and I are returning to our farm... to say our last good- byes.
Yeah.
We need closure.
Well, I can sympathize there, sister, I truly can.
Until recently, I, too, had a home.
Echo Mine it was called.
Us jackrabbits lived there for generation after generation.
Till some land- grabbing bandit moved in... and flushed us out like yesterday' s oatmeal.
Ahem.
Excuse us.
My good fellow, we must be on our way.
Wait!
There he is!
Slim!
You mean this no- good varmint... is hiding out in Echo Mine right now?
- Without a doubt.
- Maggie, what are you thinking?
Look, I got a score to settle with that rhinestone fat boy... and nothing to lose.
But it' il be dangerous going after Slim all by yourself.
Hey, I got the rabbit.
That' s not all you got, Maggie.
You got us.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
No.
We are sticking to our plan and going home.
Hold on, you two.
As strange as this sounds, Grace is actually making sense.
- Thank you.
- You want the money... and I want to get even with Slim.
The three of us go together, and we' re sure to get him.
Once you collect the reward, I' il walk out your front gate... and I' il stay out of it forever.
Deal?
Your powers of persuasion are uncanny.
Deal.
Ha!
Bovine bounty hunters!
Now I' ve seen everything.
Let' s get moving, ladies.
Let' s get moving, ladies.
Time for an underground smackdown.
Yee- haw!
{y: i} Out in the land where {y: i} the heroes meet their makers {y: i} Out in the land where {y: i} the hale and hearty fall {y: i} Out where the fearless {y: i} get the shudders {y: i} Justice is here, {y: i} and it' s wearing udders {y: i} Yee- haw!
{y: i} The cows are walkin 'tall {y: i} Home, home, {y: i} this ain' t it, pal {y: i} Home, home, {y: i} home on the range {y: i} Home, home, {y: i} better go git, pal {y: i} Home, home, {y: i} home on the range {y: i} SLlM:
OK, boys, let' s go {y: i} through it one last time.
- Who am I?
- Uncle Slim?
Correct!
Heh.
Now, I put on my hat... then I put on my spectacles...
- Aah!
Hey!
Who' re you?
- Where' s Uncle Slim?
Ohh!
It' s still me!
Can' t you stupid sack of hammers get it right?
Oh, the ever- punctual Mr. Weaseley.
{y: i} OK, everybody make way... {y: i} for the big man {y: i} in black market livestock.
- Hey, who' re you?
All right, come on!
{y: i} Move it, Bessie, or {y: i} I' il tan your hides right here.
L... hey, hey, hey!
Watch the suit!
Watch the suit!
Feast your eyes.
5, 000 cows on the barrelhead as promised, Mr. Weaseley.
The name' s Wesley.
So, Slim, what do you say we get a move on... and load these cash cows onto the train A. S. A. P., huh?
Let' s go.
Yes, yes, of course.
Hmm.
Lucky Jack, you did it!
{y: i} We' re here!
Well, {y: i} I take my hat off to you, Jack.
But you' ve got us here in one piece.
Well, seein 'is believin'.
And I don' t believe what I see.
Oh, it' s Buck!
{y: i} Stallion of the Cim- moron.
I' m supposed to be here just in case... one of the horses get tired.
Cows only.
Look, friend, you don' t understand my situation.
No, you don' t understand... {y: i} so I' il say it again.
{y: i} The only critters {y: i} that get by me are cows.
{y: i} Cows only.
Oh, come on!
Look, cut me a break.
Now what?
Aww, what are you doing here?
Ha ha!
Sorry we' re late.
We got separated from the herd.
Right this way, little lady.
Tell 'em Junior sent you.
Ohhh...
- Howdy, partner!
- Ahem.
- Nice hat, ma' am.
- Oh!
Cheeky devil.
Excuse me, reject.
Coming through.
Oh!
Hey, what gives?!
How come they got to go through?
They' re cows.
What?!
But what about the rabbit?
Well, obviously, he was with the cows.
Ha!
I' m with the cows, too!
Yeah!
Hey!
Hey, cows!
W- wait up!
You got to tell this guy you know me!
See, Junior, we' re old friends!
Come on, Margie!
Uh, Gretchen!
Miss, uh... uh, Hat Cow!
Come on, it' s your old pal Buck, see?
Buck...
Oh, Buck!
Nah, doesn' t ring a bell.
No, no, no, wait!
No!
Hang on... hang on a second.
Heh heh heh.
They' re just kidding.
You see, if you could...
Oh, hey!
Hey!
Hey, cows!
Cows!
Oof!
Don' t make me hurt you.
Heh heh.
[Laughs]
I gotta go, but let' s throw on the old feedbag sometime.
Stay cool.
Ha ha ha!
It' s hero time.
So what' s the plan?
Well, let' s see...
You two get his attention while I sneak up behind him... and then I' il knock him into the cart... and then we' il rope him up and wheel him to justice!
And for extra measure... how about we conk him on the noggin with this?
You go, cowgirl!
That' s usin 'the old hat.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Now, you lost me here, missy.
Look, Jack, it' s simple.
Cart, smack, rope, roll, justice.
Come on, Jack, focus.
{y: i} Now is not the time to get {y: i} all scatterbrained and flaky.
Oh, good, I' m not too late.
Sorry.
Still stakin 'out your quarry, huh?
Yeah, pretty much.
Why?
Listen, I came to warn you, one equine to another, about Rico.
As soon as he nabs that rustler... he' s gonna be in a big hurry to collect that reward.
- So?
- So?!
Once he catches his man, that' s when the horsewhip comes out... and he' s not shy about using it, either!
- Horsewhip?
- Horsewhip!
And not only are you gonna be carrying Rico... but that rustler as well.
Have you seen that guy?
He' s huge!
What should I do?
- Run!
- OK.
Yeah, run like the wind, partner, and save yourself!
I' m going!
Go on, take off!
Ride into the sunset!
- All righty, I' m outta here!
- Aah!
Scram!
OK, thanks, buddy!
I owe you one!
Godspeed, my friend!
So long, sucker!
Ha ha!
He must be takin 'stupid lessons from that buffalo.

Can' t you morons count to yourselves?
Come on.
Gotta start all over!
- There he is.
- Come on, let' s go!
Hold on!
You' re both forgetting Slim' s hypnotic control... over those with less than perfect pitch.
Jack, I hope you can forgive me.
- For what, missy?
Aah!
- For that.
Now, you watch it there, toots!
Grace, how practical!
Done countin '!
- What do we got?
- 4, 997.
- What?
- Huh?
Wait, wait, what?
I thought you said 5, 000 even.
Of course I did.
Gil must' ve just miscounted, that' s all.
Huh?
There' s one up there!
The others can' t be far behind.
{y: i} Just you watch.
You' re gonna like this.
Yodeling' s an art.
Huh?
Ha ha ha!
What' s the deal, Slimbo?
Maybe she wasn' t an art lover.
Philistine!
Shut up, you greenhorns!
A bovine ain' t been born that can resist my charms.
[Thump]
Watch your back, Uncle Slim!
Got you!
Where do you think you' re going?
- Now, Jack!
- OK!
What in the rootin '- tootin' blazes is goin 'on here?!
Uncle Slim!
Uncle Slim!
Let' s get outta here!
- Aah!
- Come back here, dog meat!
- Jackpot!
- We got him now!
- Well done!
- Watch out!
It' s Buck!
Hey, Casey Jones... grab the bills and fire up the getaway express!
Uncle Slim!
Uncle Slim!
I gave up clown college for this?
BUCK:
Aah!
Ooh!
Mama!
It' s Slim!
I got Slim!
Rico' s gonna be so proud of me!
Thank you!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Ooh!
Leave me alone!
Yaaah- hoo- hoo- hooey!
- Sorry.
- Uncle Slim!
Uncle Slim!
- Quick, girls, in here!
- Ooh!
Hey!
Huh?
That was Rico!
What in blue blazes?
I' il knock you {y: i} into next Tuesday!
{y: i} Come back here!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
- You' re going down!
Junior!
Junior!
- Oh!
Whoa!
- Junior!
Junio- o- or!
Whoo- hah!
- Get this off of me!
- Uncle Slim!
Uncle Slim!
Rico' s saddle!
I' m wearing Rico' s saddle!
- Uncle Slim!
Oof!
- Ohh!
- Surprise!
- Oof!
We made it, girls!
We made it!
{y: i} - Three cheers!
{y: i} - Hip- hip- hooray!
Ladies, we got company!
Whoa!
Stop!
Hit the brake!
Look out!
Yaah!
Dagnabit!
I guess I gotta do everything around here myself!
Call me crazy, but I think these cows got it in for me.
Maybe they just don' t like your singing.
Shut up!
Ahem.
Mr. Weaseley, my money, if you please.
Heh heh heh.
I was just keeping it safe for you, Slim.
Sure you were.
{y: i} Protecting my investments {y: i} is what I pay this fellow for.
Rico.
You' re too kind, boss.
No, it can' t be.
His reputation as a bounty hunter is well- known... but lately he' s been doing a little moonlighting... and covering my tracks.
Rico' s going to see you to the border... so that nothing else goes wrong.
Now, if you' il all pardon me... there' s a little Patch of Heaven... on the auction block this morning.
He' s going to buy our farm!
Adios!
Yee- haw!
I don' t know how you got here, skittish... but stick with me, and you may get to like... the other side of the law.
Get on there!
Hyah!
{y: i} All right, come on!
Come on!
{y: i} Move it, Bessie!
Get in there!
Hurry up!
You don' t want to be late... for that big round- up in the sky!
[Neighs]
Skittish, whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Get in there!
Come on, you stupid cows!
Come on!
{y: i} WESLEY:
{y: i} Now get the engine fired up... {y: i} and let' s make tracks.
[Neighs]
Make a break for it, {y: i} ladies!
Run!
Whoa!
Hah!
Skittish, whoa!
Buck, have you gone crazy?!
Now, that' s entirely possible!
Yo!
Or maybe I just figured out who the real heroes are!
Wait!
What if this is some kind of trick?
Whoo!
Whassah!
Oh, this isn' t a trick!
It' s a miracle!
Come on!
So you think you got the drop on me... well, think again!
Hyah!
[Sputters]
This is useless.
Let' s put our heads together.
More brains and less brawn.
All right!
OK, Caloway, fetch!
- Kaboosh!
- Hyah!
Ha!
[Tarzan yell]
Mother of mercy.
Is this the end of Rico?
BUCK:
Bravo!
Bravo!
You stopped Rico cold!
Aw, shucks.
T' weren' t nothin '.
Fat lot of good it done us.
Alameda Slim has already flown the coop.
She' s right.
Unless we sprout wings, we' il never make it back in time.
I can' t believe what I' m hearing.
This train goes right by Patch of Heaven.
What is in the cud you' ve been chewin '?
How are we supposed to drive that thing?
How?
How?
I' il tell you how!
The same way we walked off the farm into the unknown.
The same way we fought off those burly barmaids.
And the same way we braved the western wilderness... without the benefit of food or water.
We caught Slim once, and we shall do it again!
Who' s with me?
Get out of here, you bulls!
Head for the hills!
Whoo!
- Let' s get it on!
- Cows rule!
{y: i} Howdy, darlin '!
Down here!
Yeah!
Look... look down!
Hello there!
Oh, no!
I got two words for you guys... cold shower!
We don' t have time for this nonsense!
We have a farm to save!
- Well, maybe we can help you.
- Maybe we can help each... oof!
- Other!
- Ohh!
Bye!
Come up and see us sometime!
Grace!
Oh, no!
It' s the Morning Express!
There' s a switch up ahead!
Way ahead of you, pops!
Hop on!
- Come on, mule!
- Let' s ride!
Yee- haw!
Ha!
Ha!
- Whoa!
- Oh!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Roadhogs!
See you back at the farm, girls!
{y: i} Good luck!
This happens all the time.
Sold!
All property and livestock...
Sold!
All property and livestock... formerly known as Patch of Heaven... is hereby sold to Mr. Yancy O' Del.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Heh heh heh.
O' Del' s the name, foreclosure' s the game.
Well, just set yourself over yonder.
Sign this deed, and the property is all yours.
{y: i} Much obliged, sheriff.
{y: i} Ha ha ha!
- There it is!
- Home and hearth!
And a holy hallelujah of a curve!
- Oh, quick, the brakes!
- No time for that!
- But won' t we jump the tracks?
- We are makin 'our own tracks!
This is going to be messy!
Hee hee hee!
The whole territory belongs to me.
Huh?
Five cents for these chicks.
Come on, now, do I hear two cents?
- Behind you!
- B- behind you!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Hold your britches!
Come on, now!
Whoa!
Run for your lives!
Watch yourself!
What' s the idea of crashing your train on my property?
What?
Uh...
It can' t be!
Hold it right there!
Piggies, it' s time to open up a can of whoop- hide!
Unh!
Oof!
Ow!
Aah!
Oh!
Get away from there!
Aah!
Oh, come on!
Ow!
Oof!
You wanna get nuts?
Let' s get nuts!
It' s Alameda Slim!
You think you' ve won?
It ain' t over till the fat man sings!
Alameda Slim, you' re under arrest.
Nobody messes with Pearl' s girls!
- Say, girls, got milk?
- Buck!
Just kidding.
Take him away, boys!
Hope you like stripes.
Pearl, your cows can' t do much with Slim' s reward money.
{y: i} Think you can find {y: i} some use for it?
Whoo- eee!
My farm is saved!
Where' s Maggie?
I can' t believe she just left.
I' m gonna miss her.
So shall I, Grace.
Her brash manner, her bullheadedness.
She risked her life for us, and who are we but strangers?
We were privileged to know her.
She was a cow like no other!
Right down to her appalling bodily eruptions.
- Ahh, that was good!
- Maggie!
I was just having one for the road... when I heard all the nice stuff... you guys were saying about me.
You know, maybe I could hang around a while.
- How about forever?
- Oh!
Hmm.
Well, it' s your call, Caloway.
Is this barnyard big enough for the both of us?
Only if you let me wear the hat.
Yee- haw!
Come on, move your hides, girls.
Last one to the barn sleeps standing up!
OK, everyone, big smiles!
OK, everyone, big smiles!
{y: i} LUCKY JACK:
{y: i} "So it was that Alameda Slim... {y: i} '" the most notorious {y: i} and feared cattle rustler... {y: i} was apprehended and unmasked {y: i} by three unusual dairy cows. "
Hey!
Dagnabit, Jeb!
How many times I got to tell you to wait your turn?
How many times have I got to tell you... to get out of my barrel...
Hey, dagnabit!
You ornery ol '...
It' s so nice that Jeb finally found a friend.
Here they come, everybody!
- Well done!
- Ha ha ha!
Well, hi ho, ladies!
Hey, Barry, three queens, two kings, hmm?
Full house.
And the joker is wild.
Oh, yeah.

Mozart!
Forgive your assassin!
I confess, I killed you!
"Sí", I killed you, Mozart.
Forgive your assassin!
Forgive me, Mozart!
Signore Salieri, open the door, be good now!
Is that good!
"Signore", believe me...... this is the most delicious thing I ever ate in my life!
Really, you don' t know what you' re miss...
Open the door.
"Signore", if you don' t open this door...... we' re gonna leave nothing for you.
And I' m never gonna come see you again!
Good morning, Father.
Herr Salieri?
Leave me alone.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Do you know who I am?
That makes no difference.
All men are equal in God' s eyes.
Are they?
Offer me your confession.
I can offer you God' s forgiveness.
How well are you trained in music?
I studied it in my youth.
- Where?
- Here in Vienna.
Then you must know this.
I can' t say that I do.
What is it?
It was a very popular tune in its day.
I wrote it.
Here, how about this?
This one brought down the house when we played it.
I regret it is not too familiar.
Can you recall no melody of mine?
I was the most famous composer in Europe.
I wrote 40 operas alone.
What about this one?
Yes, I know that!
That' s charming!
I' m sorry, I didn' t know you wrote that.
I didn' t.
That was Mozart.
Wolfgang...... Amadeus Mozart.
The man you accuse yourself of killing.
You' ve heard that?
Is it true?
For God' s sake, my son...... if you have something to confess, do it now.
Give yourself some peace.
He...... was my idol.
Mozart.
I can' t think of a time when I didn' t know his name.
I was playing games...... when he was playing music for kings and emperors.
Even the pope in Rome.
I admit, I was jealous...... when I heard the tales they told about him.
Not of the brilliant little prodigy...... but of his father, who had taught him everything.
My father, he did not care for music.
When I told him...... how I wished I could be like Mozart...... he would say, "Why?
Do you want to be a trained monkey?
You' d like me to drag you around, doing tricks like a circus freak? "
How could I tell him...... what music meant to me?
While my father prayed earnestly to God...... to protect commerce......
I would offer up...... secretly...... the proudest prayer a boy could think of.
"Lord, make me a great composer."
"Let me celebrate your glory through music...... and be celebrated myself."
"Make me immortal."
"After I die...... let people speak my name with love for what I wrote."
"In return...... I will give you my chastity...... my industry...... my deepest humility, every hour of my life."
"Amen."
And do you know what happened?
A miracle!
I knew God had arranged it all.
One minute I was a frustrated boy...... in an obscure little town.
The next I was here...... in Vienna, city of musicians...... and Emperor Joseph, the musical king.
Isn' t that incredible?
Every night I sat with the emperor of Austria...... playing duets with him...... correcting the royal sight- reading.
But what did it matter?
He adored my music.
I kept my hands off women.
I worked hours every day teaching students, many for free!
Work, that was all my life.
He came to Vienna to play some of his music...... at the residence of the Prince Archbishop of Salzburg.
Eagerly, I went there to seek him out.
That night...... changed my life.
I played a little game with myself.
This man had written his first concerto at the age of 4...... his first symphony at 7, a full- scale opera at 12!
Did it show?
Is talent like that...... written on the face?
Which one of them...... could he be?
Mozart is not here.
- Stop it!
- Stop it!
- I am stopping it.
I am!
There.
I' ve stopped.
- Now we' re going back.
Yes!
You don' t know where you are.
People walk and dance and sing and even talk backwards.
- That' s stupid.
- Why?
People fart backwards.
Ssa- ym- ssik!
Ssa- ym- ssik!
You are very sick.
Say it backwards, shitwit!
Ssa- ym- ssik.
Ym, my.
Kiss my ass.
Em- yrram!
- I' m not playing!
- Say it, it' s serious.
It' s very serious.
Marry me.
I' m not gonna marry you.
You' re a fiend.
Tub.
But I...... love...
But I love you?
- Tihs- ym- tae.
- What?
- Eat.
- My.
Eat my shit.
You filthy fiend!
My music.
They' ve started without me.
That was Mozart!
That giggling, dirty creature I' d just seen crawling on the floor.
- I think that went well, don' t you?
- Indeed.
The Viennese know good music, don' t you think?
Certainly.
Your Grace.
Ah, Mozart.
- Why?
- Why what, sir?
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests...... by one of my own servants?
The more license I allow you, the more you take.
If His Grace is not satisfied, he can dismiss me.
- Your father is waiting for you there.
- No, Your Grace!
I would prefer you dismissed me.
It' s obvious I don' t satisfy.
I have no intention of dismissing you.
You will remain in my service...... and learn your place.
On the page it looked...
Nothing!
The beginning simple, almost comic.
Just a pulse.
And then, suddenly...... high above it...... an oboe.
A single note, hanging there, unwavering.
Until...... a clarinet took it over...... sweetened it into a phrase of such delight.
This was no composition by a performing monkey.
This was a music I had never heard.
Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing.
It seemed to me I was hearing the voice of God.
Excuse me.
Why would God choose an obscene child to be his instrument?
He' s remarkable, Majesty.
I heard an extraordinary opera of his last month.
- Idomeneo, King of Crete.
- That?
I heard it too.
Tiresome?
A young man trying to impress beyond his abilities.
Too much spice.
Too many notes.
Majesty...... it was the most promising work I' ve heard in years.
Then, we should make some effort to acquire him.
We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
I' m sure he could be tempted with the right offer.
Say...... an opera in German for our National Theater.
But not German.
I beg, Your Majesty.
Italian is the proper language for opera.
All educated people agree on that.
What do you think, chamberlain?
In my opinion, it' s time we had a piece in our own language.
Plain German for plain people.
Kapellmeister?
Majesty...... I must agree with "Herr Direttore".
German is...... too brute for singing.
Court composer...... what do you think?
I think it' s an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna.
It should infuriate the archbishop...... if that is Your Majesty' s intention.
You are "cattivo", court composer.
I want to meet this young man.
Arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
Well, there it is!
Here is the other one.
I think you will love it.
Here' s the third one.
So?
Here we go.
- How do you like it?
- They' re all so beautiful!
Why don' t I have three heads?
Three heads!
Gentlemen.
- Good morning.
- Morning, Your Majesty.
What do you have for me today?
- Your Majesty, "Herr Mozart".
- Yes, what about him?
He' s here.
Well, there it is.
Good!
What a charming idea, court composer.
May I see?
Just a...
Just a trifle, of course.
May I try it?
Let' s have some fun.
Delightful, court composer!
May I play it when he comes in?
- You do me too much honor.
- Bring in "Herr Mozart".
I need a minute to practice.
Good, continue.
Excellent!
Good, Majesty.
Very good.
Very good, Majesty.
Tempo!
Lightly, then strongly!
It' s a march, Majesty.
Bravo, Majesty!
Gentlemen, please.
A little less enthusiasm, I beg you.
No, please.
It' s not a holy relic.
You know, we have met before.
You don' t recall.
He was giving a delightful concert!
As he got off the stool, he fell.
My sister Antoinette helped him up.
Know what he did?
He jumped into her arms and said, "Will you marry me?
Yes or no? "
You know all these gentlemen.
The Baron Van Swieten.
- I' m a great admirer of yours.
- Thank you.
Kapellmeister Bonno.
The Director of Opera, Count Orsini- Rosenberg.
The honor is mine, absolutely!
Here is our illustrious court composer...... Maestro Salieri.
At last, such immense joy!
I know your work well.
You know, I composed some variations on a melody of yours.
- Really?
Which one?
- "Mio Caro Adone."
I' m flattered.
A funny tune, but it yielded good things.
"Herr Salieri" composed this little march for you.
Really?
Well, there it is.
Down to business.
We' re going to commission an opera from you.
What do you say?
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
Did we?
- German.
Please let it be German.
- Why so?
Because I' ve already found the most wonderful libretto.
Have I seen it?
It' s quite new.
- I' il show it to you immediately.
- I think you' d better.
Tell us the story.
Well, it' s quite amusing, Majesty.
It' s set...
The whole thing is set in a...
Where?
In a harem, Majesty.
In a seraglio.
- You mean in Turkey?
- Yes, exactly.
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
It doesn' t, especially.
It could be in Turkish if you really want.
No, my dear fellow, the language is not finally the point.
Do you really think that subject is appropriate for a national theater?
Why not?
It' s charming.
I mean, I won' t actually show concubines exposing their...
It' s highly moral, Majesty.
It' s full of proper German virtues.
Excuse me, Majesty, but what do you think these could be?
Being a foreigner, I' d love to learn.
Well, tell him, Mozart.
Name us a German virtue.
- Love, sire.
- Oh, love!
Of course, in Italy we know nothing about love.
No, I don' t think you do.
Watching Italian opera, all those male sopranos screeching...... stupid, fat couples rolling their eyes about.
That' s not love.
It' s rubbish!
Majesty, you choose the language.
I' il set it to the finest music ever offered a monarch.
Well, there it is.
Let it be German.
Keep it.
It' s already here in my head.
What?
On one hearing only?
I think so, sire.
Show us.
The rest is just the same, isn' t it?
That doesn' t really work, does it?
Did you try...?
Shouldn' t it be a bit more...?
Or this?
Yes.
Better?
What do you think?
All I ever wanted was to sing to God.
He gave me that longing...... and then made me mute.
Why?
Tell me that.
If he didn' t want me to praise him with music...... why implant the desire...... like a lust in my body?
And then deny me the talent?
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Maestro.
How do you like it?
It' s Turkish.
My hairdresser said everything this year' s going to be Turkish.
Does he?
Come, come!
Well, I heard you met "Herr Mozart".
News travels fast in Vienna.
And he' s been commissioned to write an opera.
Is it true?
- Yes.
- Is there a part in it for me?
- No.
- How do you know?
- Do you know where it' s set, my dear?
- Where?
In a harem.
- What' s that?
- A brothel.
Come.
Let' s begin.
- What does he look like?
- You might be disappointed.
- Why?
Looks and talent don' t always go together, Katerina.
Looks don' t concern me, maestro.
Only talent interests a woman of taste.
Shall we continue?
There she stood!
On stage, for all to see.
Showing off like the greedy songbird she was.
Ten minutes of ghastly scales.
Arpeggios!
Whizzing up and down like fireworks at a fairground.
Understand, I was in love with the girl.
Or at least in lust.
And I swear to you, I never laid a finger on her.
All the same, I couldn' t bear to think of anyone else touching her.
Brava, madame!
You are an ornament to our stage.
Your Majesty.
Well, "Herr Mozart".
Well, decidedly that.
An excellent effort!
You have shown us something...... quite new tonight.
- It is new.
- It is, isn' t it, sire?
- Yes, indeed.
You really liked it, sire?
Well, of course I did!
It' s very good!
Of course, now and then, just now and then...... it seemed a touch...
What do you mean, sire?
Well, I mean, occasionally, it seems to have...
How shall one say...?
How shall one say, "direktor"?
- Too many notes, Majesty?
Very well put.
- Too many notes.
- I don' t understand.
There are just as many notes as I required, neither more nor less.
My dear fellow, there are in fact...... only so many notes the ear can hear in an evening.
I think I' m right in saying that, aren' t I, court composer?
Yes.
This is absurd!
It' s quality work.
Just cut a few and it' il be perfect.
Which few did you have in mind?
Wolfgang!
Wolfgang, my dear!
- Wolfgang!
- Majesty, this is "Frau Weber".
She' s my landlady.
- Enchanted, madame.
- Sire, such an honor!
This is my dear daughter, Constanze.
- She' s the fiancée of "Herr Mozart".
- Really?
How charming.
Please.
Well...... when do you marry?
We haven' t exactly received my father' s consent yet.
Not entirely.
Not altogether.
- Excuse me, but how old are you?
- 26.
My advice is for you to marry this charming young lady...... and stay with us in Vienna.
- You see?
I told him that, but he won' t listen to me.
Your Majesty, you give such wonderful...... such royal advice.
May I...?
Well, there it is.
Wolfie, get some water!
- Can we go home?
At that moment I knew, beyond any doubt...... he' d had her.
It was incomprehensible!
What was God up to?
Was it possible I was being tested?
Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness...... in the face of every offense?
No matter how painful?
Why choose Mozart to teach me lessons in humility?
For his sake...... as well as mine.
- No!
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat!
The fault is mine, entirely.
I was too indulgent with him.
Please, Your Grace?
Give him one more chance?
You have leave to try.
God bless, Your Grace!
I thank you!
I write to you with urgent news.
I' m coming to Vienna.
Take no further steps towards marriage until we meet.
As you honor the father who has devoted his life to yours...... do as I bid, and await my coming.
I now join you in the holy bonds of matrimony.
Those whom God hath joined together...... let no man put asunder.
Beloved father:
You say Vienna is the musicians' city.
To conquer here is to conquer Europe.
With my wife I can do it.
One day, when I' m wealthy...... you' il live with us, and we' il be so happy.
Good morning.
This is my niece, Princess Elizabeth.
Your Highness.
She' s asked me to recommend a music instructor.
- I' ve come up with an excellent idea.
- Your Majesty!
It would be such a tremendous honor!
I was thinking of "Herr Mozart".
What is your view?
It' s an interesting idea, Majesty, but...
Yes?
My concern is to protect you...... from any hint of favoritism.
Favoritism.
- What is this?
- What is what?
Why must I submit samples of my work to a committee to teach a girl?
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Is the emperor angry with me?
- Quite the contrary.
- Then why not appoint me to the post?
No.
But I' m the best.
A little modesty might suit you better.
Who is on this committee?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Salieri.
Naturally, the Italians!
Of course, always the Italians!
They' re all musical idiots!
- And you want them to judge my music?
Do you want me to beg on the streets?
- All they want to see is your work.
- Shit.
- No, they won' t.
Your Excellency.
- Frau Mozart?
- I' ve come on behalf of my husband.
I brought samples of his work so he can be considered for the appointment.
How charming, but why did he not come himself?
Well, he' s terribly busy, sir.
I understand.
I will look at them the moment I can.
It will be an honor.
Please give him my warmest regards.
Would it be too much trouble to ask you to look at them now?
- While I wait.
- I' m afraid I' m not at leisure...... this precise moment.
I assure you, they will be safe.
I really cannot do that, sir.
You see, he doesn' t know I' m here.
Then he didn' t send you?
No, sir.
This was my own idea.
- I see.
- Sir, we' re desperate.
We really need this job.
My husband spends far more than he can ever earn.
I don' t mean that he' s lazy, because he works all day long.
It' s just that he' s not practical.
Money simply slips through his fingers.
It' s ridiculous.
Let me offer you some refreshment.
Do you know what these are?
"Capezzoli di Venere"!
Nipples of Venus.
Try one.
Go on, try one!
They' re wonderful!
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Don' t keep calling me that.
Keeps me at such a distance.
I wasn' t born a court composer, you know.
Just like your husband.
Are you sure you can' t...... leave this and come back again?
It' s very tempting, sir.
But it' s impossible, I' m afraid.
You see, they' re all originals.
- Originals?
- Yes, sir.
He doesn' t make copies.
Astounding!
It was actually...
He had simply written down music...... already finished in his head.
Page after page of it.
And music...... finished as no music is ever finished.
Displace one note...... and there would be diminishment.
Here again was the very voice of God.
So you will help us?
I dine with the emperor tomorrow evening.
Thank you!
No?
If you wish it for your husband, come tonight.
Then don' t.
It' s up to you.
He didn' t think I would enjoy it.
What is it?
I will hinder and harm your creature on earth...... as far as I am able.
Well, what?
Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
But the man' s a fool!
You can talk to the emperor...... and tell him that "Herr Zummer" is an awful choice.
Herr Mozart.
Good boy.
Just as if we weren' t here.
- I said play!
Stop!
Please.
Keep playing!
Keep playing!
That' s it!
Mozart, that' s wonderful!
Wonderful!
Papa!
Am I not welcome?
Papa, welcome!
You' re very thin.
She stuffs me like a goose all day!
- Is she not here?
- No, she had to help her mother.
Stanzi, this is my father.
We' il wait.
She' s very tired, poor creature.
Oh.
How is your...... financial situation?
Couldn' t be better.
It' s wonderful.
Really, it' s marvelous!
People love me here.
They say you have debts.
Who says that?
That' s a malicious lie!
Do you have pupils?
I don' t want pupils!
They get in the way.
I have to have time for composition.
Composition doesn' t pay.
That one will.
What' s that?
No!
Please!
I don' t want you to see it.
I don' t want anyone to see it.
The best thing anyone...
Look at her!
Isn' t she beautiful?
Now, Papa, confess it.
- Could you want a prettier daughter?
- Stop it, Wolfie!
I look dreadful.
Are you...... expecting?
- Yes, I am.
- Isn' t it marvelous?
We' re delighted.
- May I offer you some tea?
- Who wants tea?
Let' s go out!
This calls for a feast.
You don' t want tea, do you?
I know!
Tea!
Hurry!
Good day.
Now!
I name the penalty!
I name the penalty!
- Give her a good one!
- Show us your legs!
It' s just a game, Papa.
"Herr Mozart", why don' t you name your son' s penalty?!
Yes, Papa.
Name it.
I' il do anything you say.
Anything.
I want you to come back to Salzburg with me.
The penalty must be performed in the room.
I' m tired of this game.
But my penalty!
I' ve got to have a penalty!
The penalty is...... you shall play our tune...... in the manner of Johann Sebastian Bach!
- Turn him over!
- Over?!
Now you play it backwards!
- Another one!
Give me another one!
- Play it like Gluck!
- Boring.
Another!
- Handel!
I don' t like him!
Play Salieri.
Now that is a challenge!
That is a challenge.
Please!
Mock me.
Laugh!
That was not Mozart laughing, Father.
Laugh.
Show my mediocrity for all to see.
One day I will laugh at you.
- What?
She won' t talk to me.
- Are you "Herr Mozart"?
- That' s right.
My name is Lorl, sir.
I' m a maidservant.
I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
They' il be paid for by an admirer of yours who wishes to remain...... anonymous.
Is this your idea, Papa?
Mine?
- Are you playing a trick on me?
- I' ve never seen this girl.
- Is this some kind of joke?
- Not at all, sir.
Young woman, this won' t do.
My son can' t accept such an offer, no matter how generous...... unless he knows who' s behind it.
- I can' t tell you that, sir.
- This is ridiculous!
- What is ridiculous?
Wolfie has many admirers in Vienna.
People send us gifts all the time.
You cannot accept her without references.
Well, this is none of your business.
- That' s right.
Splendid!
Now we' re going to let a stranger into our house.
Who is we?
Who is letting who...?
- Could you please wait outside?
We spend a fortune on you, and all you can do is criticize.
- Stanzi!
It' s right that he should hear!
We can' t do anything right for you, can we?
You won' t have to do anything for me ever again.
I' m leaving.
- No, Papa.
- I won' t stay and be a burden.
No one calls you that.
She does.
She says I sleep all day.
And so you do!
The only time you come out is to eat.
Well, what do you expect?
Do you expect anyone to walk out into a mess like this every day?
- So now I' m a bad housekeeper!
- So you are.
When can you start?
- Good.
They' re out every night, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Not that I' ve seen.
Then how does he pay for all this?
Does he work at all?
All day long.
He never leaves the house till evening.
He just sits there, writing and writing.
Really?
What is it he' s writing?
I wouldn' t know that, sir.
Of course not.
You' re a good girl.
The next time you' re sure they' il be out of the house, let me know.
Thank you, sir.
I think I found out about the money, sir.
Yes?
He kept seven snuffboxes in here.
I could swear they were all gold.
There' s only one left.
Where does he work?
Gentlemen, I' ve just heard some news...... that may interest you.
- What?
Mozart is writing a new opera.
An Italian opera.
That' s not all.
He has chosen for his subject, Figaro.
The Marriage of Figaro.
He' s setting that play to music?
Yes.
What is this "Marriage of Figaro"?
It has been banned by the emperor.
Herr Mozart.
Gentlemen, sit down.
Are you aware that I have declared the French play "Figaro"...... unsuitable for our theater?
Yes, sire.
Yet we hear you' re making an opera from it.
Is this true?
Who told you this, Majesty?
It is not your place to ask questions.
Is it true?
Yes, I...
I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
Majesty, it is only a comedy.
What you think is scarcely the point.
But, Your Majesty...
I do not censor things lightly.
When I do, I have good reason.
"Figaro" is a bad play.
It stirs up hatred between classes.
In France, it has caused only bitterness.
My sister Antoinette is beginning to be frightened of her own people.
I swear, there' s nothing like that in the piece.
I' ve taken out everything that could give offense.
I hate politics.
I' m afraid you' re rather innocent.
In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our people...... simply over a theater piece.
Majesty, this is just a frolic.
A piece about love.
"Love".
Again!
And it' s new!
It' s entirely new.
The end of Act Il, for example.
It starts as a duet.
A husband and wife quarreling.
Suddenly, the scheming maid comes in.
It' s a very funny situation.
Duet turns into trio.
Then the husband' s valet comes in.
Then a gardener.
Quartet becomes quintet.
And so on, on and on.
Sextet, septet, octet.
How long do you think I can sustain that?
I have no idea.
Guess.
Guess, Your Majesty.
Well...
Six...... seven minutes?
- Eight minutes?
- Twenty, sire.
But with opera, with music...... you can have 20 individuals all talking at the same time.
It' s not noise.
It' s a perfect harmony!
Mozart, music is not the issue here.
No one doubts your talent.
It' s your literary judgment that' s in question.
Even with the politics taken out, it would still remain a vulgar farce.
Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?
Surely you can choose more elevated themes.
Elevated!
What does that mean, elevated?
I am fed to the teeth with these...... elevated things.
Why must we go on forever writing of gods and legends?
They go on forever.
Opera is here to ennoble us, Mozart.
You and me, just the same as His Majesty.
Come on now, be honest!
You' d rather listen to your hairdresser than Hercules, Horatius or Orpheus.
People so lofty, they sound as if they shit marble!
What!
Govern your tongue, Mozart!
How dare you!
I' m a vulgar man...... but I assure you, my music is not.
You are passionate, Mozart...... but you do not persuade.
Sire, the whole opera is finished.
Do you know how much work went into it?
His Majesty has been more than patient, "Signore".
How can I persuade if I can' t show it?
That will do, "Herr Mozart".
Just let me tell you how it begins.
May I just do that, Majesty?
Just that?
Look...
There' s a servant on his knees.
He' s measuring a space.
His bed.
To see if it will fit!
Late!
On the beat.
Good!
Yes!
Early!
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
In that case, gentlemen, I think...
And protect him against the emperor' s anger.
What anger?
About the ballet.
What ballet?
Excuse me...... but didn' t His Majesty specifically forbid the ballet in his opera?
- Yes?
- A word with you.
Now, "Herr Mozart"!
Five minutes!
Do you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in operas?
- It' s not a ballet, it' s a dance.
A dance.
Surely, His Majesty didn' t mean no dancing when it' s in the story.
It' s dangerous to interpret his edicts.
Give me your score, please.
Thank you.
What are you doing, "Herr Direktor"?
Please.
Please!
I have no one else to turn to.
- What is it?
The "direktor" has torn up a huge section of my music.
They say I have to rewrite the opera.
But it' s perfect as it is.
Please.
Can' t you talk to him?
Please.
Why bother?
He' s no friend of yours.
I mean, really!
I threw the entire score into the fire, he made me so angry.
- You burned the score?
- No, my wife took it out in time.
Thank God.
It' s unfair that a man like that should have power over our work!
But there are those who have power over him.
I think I' il take this up with the emperor.
Excellency...... would you?
With all my heart, Mozart.
Thank you.
Please, "Herr Mozart".
"Please, it' s not a holy relic."
I don' t need to tell you I said nothing, whatever, to the emperor.
I went to the theater to tell Mozart something, anything...... when suddenly, in the middle of the third act...... to my astonishment, the emperor...... who never attended rehearsals, suddenly appeared.
What is this?
I don' t understand.
Is it modern?
Majesty...... the "Herr Direktor"...... he has removed "un balletto"...... that would have occurred at this place.
Why?
No ballet in your opera.
Do you like this?
It' s not a question of liking, Majesty.
Your own law decrees it, I' m afraid.
Well, look at them!
This is nonsense!
- But, sire!
Yes, Majesty.
Can we see the scene with the music, please?
Certainly!
Bring the palace set back in, please.
The restored third act...... was bold, brilliant.
The fourth...... was astounding.
Simply because he thinks she is someone else.
I heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theater...... conferring on all who sat there, perfect absolution.
God was singing through this little man...... to all the world.
Unstoppable.
Making my defeat more bitter with every passing bar.
And then, do you know what happened?
A miracle!
I saw my defeat turn into a victory.
Mozart was lucky the emperor yawned only once.
Three yawns...... and the opera would fail the same night.
Two yawns, within a week at most.
With one yawn, the composer could still get...
That' s all it' s had!
Withdrawn!
It' s outrageous.
Still, if the public doesn' t like one' s work...... one has to accept the fact gracefully.
But what is it that they don' t like?
I can speak for the emperor.
You make too many demands on the royal ear.
You gave him four.
What did you think of it yourself?
Did you like it at all?
I thought it was marvelous.
Of course.
It' s the best opera yet written.
I know it!
Why didn' t they come?
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, friend.
You didn' t give them a bang at the end of songs...... to let them know when to clap.
I know, I know.
Maybe you should give me some lessons in that.
I wouldn' t presume.
Nevertheless, at the risk of imposing...... I' d like you to see my new piece.
It would be an honor for me.
No, the honor would be all mine.
I believe...... it is the best opera yet written, my friends.
You are the brightest star in the musical firmament.
You do honor to Vienna and to me.
"Herr Mozart"!
- How could I not?
Did my work please you?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
- You flatter me.
- No.
Salieri!
Everybody' s here and we' ve got guests.
Well, I' ve got some more.
You remember my good friend Schikaneder.
Don' t be shy.
- Wolfie?
Yes, my love?
- These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
We were just talking about Salzburg.
Your father is dead.
So rose the dreadful ghost...... from his next and blackest opera.
There on the stage, stood the figure of a dead commander.
I knew...... only I understood...... that the horrifying apparition was Leopold...... raised from the dead!
Wolfgang had actually summoned up his own father...... to accuse his son before all the world!
It was...... terrifying and wonderful to watch.
And now...
... the madness began in me.
The madness of a man splitting in half.
"Don Giovanni" was played only five times in Vienna.
But, in secret, I went to every one of those five.
Worshiping sound I alone seemed to hear.
And as I stood there, understanding how...... that bitter old man was still possessing his poor son...... even from beyond the grave......
"Herr Mozart"?
I have come to commission work from you.
- What work?
- A Mass for the dead.
What dead?
Who is dead?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
- Who are you?
- I am only a messenger.
Do you accept?
You will be well paid.
Work fast.
And be sure tell no one what you do.
You will see me again soon.
My plan was so simple...... that it terrified me.
First, I must get the death Mass, and then...... I must achieve his death.
What?
His funeral!
Imagine it!
Mozart' s little coffin in the middle.
And then...... in that silence...... music.
A divine music...... bursts out over them all.
Composed by his devoted friend...... Antonio Salieri.
What sublimity!
What depth!
What passion in the music!
Salieri has been touched by God at last...... and God forced to listen!
Powerless to stop it!
I, for once, in the end, laughing at him!
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing.
How does one do that?
How does one kill a man?
Very different when you...
Come in!
Dinner!
Are you mad?
I' m a nobleman!
Stop it!
Hold tight
I' m a famous...... horseman
And we' re a famous horsy
And I' il give you my heart
And never more we' il part
Kill me Kill me
We' re going to make a soprano stew
We' re going to make a soprano stew
Shut up!
I' m sick to death of that tune!
And I' il give you my heart
Leporello!
Some hay!
With what...... we' ve presented
And love our dove of peace
- What did you think?
- It was wonderful!
- He liked the little people.
- It' s all in good fun.
You belong here.
You could do anything you like.
The more fantastic, the better.
That' s what people want: fantasy.
You write a proper part for me...... a couple of catchy songs...... I guarantee you a triumph deluxe!
- What do you say?
- How much will you pay him?
I see you brought your manager with you.
Well, madame...... how about half the receipts?
- Stanzi!
How much will you pay him now?
Down payment?
Who do you think I am, the emperor?
Stay here, you' il enjoy this next one.
You won' t do this.
Half the house!
- When?
We need money now!
He pays you now, or you don' t do it.
I don' t trust that man.
I don' t like what he did with your opera.
It was common.
Half the house.
You won' t put a thing in my hand until I see some money!
What a surprise!
That' s hardly the way to go about it.
If I offer mine...... you should offer yours.
Please!
Why?
Tell him I' m working on it.
Come back later.
Good.
Where' s our friend?
He' s not here.
But he' s working on it, he told me to tell you.
Is that it?
Is he happy with it?
What' s this?
A Requiem Mass?
- You think I' m in the funeral business?
It' s nothing for you!
- I' m sorry.
What have you got for me?
Finished?
- The vaudeville, what do you think?
Yes.
- Can I see it?
- No.
Why not?
Because there' s nothing to see.
Look...... I asked you if we could start rehearsals next week and you said yes.
- Well, we can.
- So let me see it.
Where is it?
Here.
The rest is just scribbling.
Scribbling and bibbling.
Bibbling and scribbling.
- Like a drink?
Do you know how many people I' ve hired?
- Leave him alone!
- I' m paying them!
- He' s doing his best.
It' s ridiculous!
Your libretto!
Only an idiot would ask him to work on that!
Money.
She' s mad.
- Oh, yes?
- Wolfie, write it down.
On paper.
It' s no use to anybody in your head.
To hell with your death Mass!
What' s the matter with you?
- I won' t work there anymore.
- What happened?
You don' t know what it' s like.
"Herr Mozart" frightens me.
He drinks all day...... then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
Is he working?
Oh, I am frightened, sir, really!
- When he speaks, he makes no sense.
- Is he working?
I suppose so.
- Opera?
- Don' t ask me to go back again.
I' m very, very frightened!
Are you sure it' s an opera?
I don' t have it yet.
No.
I promise you...... I' il give you a wonderful piece, the best I ever...
This is my wife, Stanzi.
I' ve been sick, but I' m all right now, aren' t I?
He' s all right.
Give me two more weeks.
The sooner you finish, the greater your reward.
Wolfie.
I think you really are going mad.
You slave for that idiot actor who won' t give you a penny!
This is a real man, who puts down real money.
Why on earth won' t you finish it?
Can you give me one reason I can understand?
It' s killing me.
You' re drunk, aren' t you?
You' ve been drinking.
It' s not fair.
I worry about you all the time.
I do everything I can to help you.
And all you do is drink and talk nonsense, and frighten me.
Go back to bed!
Please.
Let me sit here.
I did it.
Take the child with you! "
"Go to the spa and get your health back." I was shocked.
Shocked to my foundation when I saw her.
I couldn' t believe my eyes, poor little thing.
You monster!
No one exists but you, do they?
You and your music.
"Choose a man, not a baby", I said.
"You marry him, you won' t have a pot to piss in." You selfish thing!
Simply selfish!
Do you hear me?
Pick him up.
Pick him up!
Be careful.
- Is it over?
- Yes, it' s over.
Go, go.
Go!
Where is your wife?
Where is your wife?
She went to the spa.
Truly.
Please!
You.
You are the only colleague of mine who came.
I would never miss anything you had written.
- It' s just a vaudeville.
It' s a sublime piece.
The grandest "operone"!
I tell you...... you are the greatest composer known to me.
Do you mean it?
- It' s him!
- Who?
He' s here.
Tell him to go away.
Don' t let him in.
No, no.
Ask him if he would give me some money now.
Tell him if he would, it will help me to finish it.
- Can we come in?
He' s sleeping.
- He' s all right, though?
- Yes, he' s just exhausted.
He became dizzy, that' s all.
- Well, tell him we came by, won' t you?
- Of course.
That' s his share.
- That should cheer him up.
- Indeed!
And now, good night to you all.
It was...... perfection, truly.
What happened?
He said to give you this.
And if you finish by tomorrow night...... he will pay you another hundred ducats.
Another...?
That' s too soon.
Tomorrow night...
It' s impossible.
- Yes.
It' s too soon.
Could I help you?
Would you?
Actually, you could.
- I want to go.
- Where?
- I want to go back to Vienna.
- Now?
- Yes.
- Why?
I feel wrong being here.
- Where did I stop?
- The end of the "Recordare".
So now "Confutatis"...
How would you translate that?
"Consigned to flames of woe."
- Do you believe in it?
A fire which never dies, burning you forever.
Oh, yes.
Possible.
- Come, let' s begin.
- We ended in F major.
- Yes.
- So, now, A minor.
- Yes.
A minor.
Start with the voices.
- Basses first.
- Time?
Second beat of the first measure.
On A.
Second measure, second beat.
You see?
G- sharp?
- Of course.
Second beat of the third measure, on E.
Do you have me?
Show me.
Good.
Now the tenors.
Fourth beat of the first measure, on C.
D.
- Yes, continue.
Second beat of the fourth measure, on F.
Second bassoon, bass trombones, basses.
Identical notes and rhythm.
First bassoon, tenor trombones, with the tenors.
- You go too fast.
- Do you have it?
- Bassoon to trombone what?
- With the tenors.
- Identical?
- The instruments doubling the voices.
Trumpets and timpani.
Trumpets in D. Listen.
- I don' t understand!
- Listen!
Trumpets in D, tonic and dominant, first and third beats.
It goes with the harmony!
Yes, yes!
And that' s all?
No, now for the real fire.
Strings in unison.
Ostinato, on A. Like this:
Next measure is rising.
Show me.
- It' s wonderful!
- Write that down!
- Yes, yes.
"Call me among the blessed."
C major.
Sopranos and altos in thirds.
Altos on C, sopranos above.
Sopranos up to F on the second "voca"?
And underneath, just violins.
Arpeggios.
Scale in eighth notes, then back to ostinato.
- Do you have it?
- You go too fast.
- Do you have it?
Good.
Show me the whole thing from the beginning.
Do you want to rest a bit?
No, I' m not tired at all.
- Then we' il finish the "Lacrimosa".
- I can keep going.
Will you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I' m not leaving you.
I' m so ashamed.
Of what?
I was foolish.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
What are you doing here?
Your husband took sick.
I brought him home.
Why you?
Because, madame, I was at hand.
You can go now.
He needs me, ma' am.
And I don' t want you here.
Just go, please.
- He asked me to stay.
- And I' m ask...
I' m back.
I missed you so much.
If you' d just...... show me that you need me.
And I' il try to do better too.
What is this?
No, Wolfie, not this.
You' re not to work on this ever again.
It' s mine.
I was assisting him.
He' s not to work on this anymore.
- But...
Good night.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, "Herr Salieri".
Please respect my wish and go.
Madame...... I will respect his.
Your merciful God.
He destroyed his own beloved, rather than let a mediocrity...... share in the smallest part of his glory.
And kept me alive to torture.
Thirty- two years of torture.
Thirty- two years of slowly watching myself become extinct.
My music...... growing fainter.
And his...
Good morning, professor.
Time for the water closet.
Sugar rolls.
Fresh sugar rolls.
I will speak for you, Father.
I speak for all mediocrities in the world.
I am their patron saint.
Mediocrities everywhere...... I absolve you.
I absolve you.
I absolve you.
I absolve you.
B L I Z Z A R D
We used to have 50 on staff here.
Fifty.
I' m the only one left.
All comes down to one schmuck: me, the night shift bellhop.
What the hell is that?
Huh?
What is he?
Y- You know where the name comes from?
It' s so simple, it' s stupid.
Some schmuck rings a bell and ya hop.
Ya hop front and center.
Did you ever meet any of the old stars, then?
What, are you kiddin '?
I took Rin Tin Tin out f or a shit, f or Christ' s sakes.
Ah, hey, you talk about stars, uh --
Hey, kid, put this on.
Go ahead.
Come on, come on, come on.
Let me see.
Let me see.
You know, and to think that I wore that stupid thing f or 50 years.
To think I did that.
Ah, shit, yeah.
Yeah, well -- Well, kid,
I' m gettin 'my ass outta here.
Yep.
Yep, kid, gotta go.
Listen, kid, stay clear of... night clerks, kids, hookers and married arguments.
Come on.
I wanna say good- bye.
Let me see.
You -- You wanna get a tip?
Hold your hand out.
That' s right.
Now, uh, smile.
Give me a smile.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now, if the cocksucker doesn' t pay ya, you say to yourself, uh, "Fuck you, Jack."
You never miss.
Tell you something else:
Keep your cock in your pants.
May I help you?
I have a reservation.
ln the honeymoon suite.
- Kiva.
Wait up.
What' d I tell you about smoking?
- You smoke.
- That' s right, I do, and I' m addicted.
So, welcome to this week' s edition of "Who is a Hypocrite?"
- This is my first guest.
- That' s enough, Kiva.
- You' re not my mother.
- Yes, I am.
Then why are we sleeping together?
Oh, you little stinker
Oh, you sweet little muffin
Yes, Mama loves the baby.
Hello.
I' m lookin 'f or the room f or makin' love.
Oh, right.
You must mean the honeymoon suite.
- Well, it' s straight that way.
Can' t miss it.
I know where it is.
I just wanted you to know that I know where I' m goin ', so you needn' t bother with me.
- Well, no problem.
Where' s your luggage?
I travel light.
Tell me, how long have the others been here?
About an hour.
One hour.
You' re very late, Eva.
I' m sorry, Athena.
I was attending a birth.
The placenta was late in coming.
Which birth is more important to you, Eva: that of a mortal, or that of a goddess?
Will there be anything else, ladies?
Wait.
We do need some things.
We need... fresh rosemary from the kitchen.
Mostly what we need is from the kitchen.
Are you listening?
Rosemary.
We need sea salt, a little bit of sea salt.
Or kosher salt, if you have no sea salt.
A bottle of spring water -- French, not that ltalian shit.
- [Blonde]
Shut up, Kiva.
Some ginger and some raw meat.
- Liver, if you have it.
- I want fries, you stupid jerks with your dumb fucking ritual.
Shut up, you little shit!
Hey.
- Don' t talk to her that way.
- Uh, if there' s nothing else -- [Beating Drum]
Thank you.
We' re communing here on New Year' s Eve... to bring to lif e the great goddess Diana, who was turned into stone in this very room... 40 years ago today.
Diana, O Great Beautiful One, we make these off erings to you... so that we may undo the wicked spell which deprived you... of the seed of your lover... of your virginal blood... of your very lif e.
We now f orm the symbolic rock... with our bodies.
On this night, in this hour, we call upon the ancient power.
O Goddess Bride, we off er thee... milk from a mother' s sweet titty.
I make this off ering... to the Divine One.
A whore not, an innocent was, f or whom I seized a virgin' s blood.
Goddess of Light, Goddess of Lust, to undo this awful spell is a real must.
I off er the sweat of five men' s thighs.
O Diana, O Great One, we live without sun... until this wicked curse is undone.
I have collected a year' s worth of tears.
Goddess Diana, f ail you, I will.
- [All Moaning]
I had him erect, and his semen would f ollow, but alas, I was hot, so hot that I swallowed.
You stupid witch!
You did?
- Why didn' t you use your hands?
Well, it just goes to show you what an amazing lack of control you have, Eva.
Didn' t your mama teach you not to put them things in your mouth?
- [Athena]
Eva, you got one hour to find me some sperm,
what kind of witch you can be.
- You hear me?
- Uh- huh.
Ted, the bellhop.
Mr. Bellboy, come right in.
Okay, mister.
Here is your $50 tip, only you have to do one more thing.
You have to make our little Eva smile.
We' il leave you alone.
Don' t use your mouth.
Help me out here.
I' ve got to earn this 50 bucks.
Look, they don' t care if I smile or not.
They just want --
You wouldn' t understand.
Try me.
I' ve been around a bit, you know.
Well, the five of us --
Athena, Jezebel, Raven, Elspeth and me -- are a coven.
- Like a coven of witches.
- Yes.
- Oh.
- You see, f or 40 years we' ve been trying to... reverse an evil spell that was placed on our goddess Diana.
She was a beautiful virgin, an entertainer by trade but a great sorceress by design.
It was here in this very room on her wedding night... that a jealous rival placed this curse on Diana.
Her husband was turned into a pink fish, while our dear goddess... a stone in her honeymoon bed.
This was Diana.
She' s the blonde.
Right.
Well.
I kinda doubt she was a virgin.
She had lovers, but she saved that f or marriage.
lf she doesn' t get his goop in ten minutes, I' m gonna go in there and get it myself.
[Gasps]
You mean, you were supposed to bring, uh --
And you -- [Gulps]
W- Whoa.
Nope.
Besides, it' s against hotel policy.
"No sex with the clientele."
See, what I really wanna do is be a midwif e.
I' ve attended f our births already.
Really?
Yes.
A f ella doesn' t like too many surprises down there.
I joined the coven to obtain greater understanding of my f eminine powers.
- Seems to be working.
- You really think so?
Oh.
Oh, God.
Who' s Betty?
- The boss.
- Oh, good.
Oh, God.
My number in Topanga.
Sure, baby.
- This is, um -- It' s a birch branch.
It symbolizes eternal lif e.
- I' m a woman now.
- Marvelous.
I use this bark f or a tea which assists in astral travel.
I wanna be a witch.
- Great.
- You are.
We did it right there in the big cauldron.
Great.
Great.
Athena.
Goddess Diana, I off er to you... the jism of the one I wooed f or you, so you may live and know such bliss... as getting laid by a guy like this.
[All]
Three times three times three.
Yeah!
W- W- What room is this?
- [Disco]
- W- What room we in?
I just got here.
404.
It' s room 404, I think.
- Look, I thought we were on the fifth floor.
Yeah.
[Ted]
Hmm, sir?
We' re in room 404.
- Yeah.
- What do you need, sir?
- What do we need?
What do we need?
- lce. lce.
- lce?
- lce.
Yeah, ice!
Right, sir.
404, sir. lce, sir.
I' il be with you momentarily.
Ooh.
[Man]
- [Pistol Cocks]
Um, is this room 404?
Let' s not beleaguer the f act that you have no sense of timing.
The f act is, you' re here, and I couldn' t think of a better time f or you... to introduce me to your beau than on New Year' s Eve.
My name is Theodore.
- I' m the bellhop.
- [Smack]
Lover boy.
Let' s cut to the chase, okay?
- Let' s get our ABC' s right here, Theodore.
- Theodore, right?
[Croaking]
Ted.
Are you saying my wif e cheats on me?
[Wheezes]
Theodore.
This is about as intimate a situation as you can get: you, me, Angela here.
Pretty cozy, isn' t it?
- [Phone Rings]
[Rings]
Mm- mmm.
- We ain' t got no needles here, kid, just a big fuckin 'gun.
- How' s that grab ya?
Now... where was l?
Ah, yeah.
[Man Clears Throat]
Now... this --
Gimme that.
Gimme that.
No.
Bad idea.
Come here.
"l --"
- "I, - I,
- must humbly -- - humbleh...
- Humbly!
Humbly!
Humbly.
- "And sincerely...
- apologize -- - polgize...
- Apologize!
- Polgi --
- Apologize.
Apologize.
- "For saying -- - Saying -- saying that I fucked another man.
- That -- - Saying that I fucked another man!
Great.
Satisfied?
Uh, do you accept the fuckin 'apology?
You always have to have the last word, Angela.
May l --
Shit, yeah.
Spit it out.
I don' t mean to upset you further, sir, but I do think she was trying to say yes.
Are you... condescending to me, Theodore?
Absolutely not, sir.
Don' t you think I noticed there' s a gag in the woman' s mouth?
- You know why I know that?
- How, sir?
- Because I put that gag in her mouth!
Don' t move a nose hair.
Whoa!
Don' t be a stranger, Teddy!
Take off your jacket and relax!
What?
We don' t have time to play charades here, you asshole.
Untie me.
Jesus, honey!
- Where' d you put the Percodan? if you would tell that nut case in there... he' s making a big fucking mistake.
Look, whether you like it or not, you are in the middle of a situation here you cannot just wish your way out of.
But I' ve never met you people bef ore!
You' re complete strangers!
Everybody starts out as strangers.
It' s where we end up that counts.
You being a good boy, Theodore?
- Quick.
He' s coming back.
Put the gag back in my mouth.
We play this game all the time.
Play by the rules and you won' t get hurt.
Come on, put the gag back in my mouth.
Quick!
- Remember, don' t make him mad.
I hope you' re being a good boy, Teddy.
Teddy!
- Whoops!
I could trust you, Theodore.
Just trying to help her breathe a little.
Well, don' t let me stop you, Teddy.
You don' t mind my calling you Teddy, do you?
No, it' s fine.
You know, once upon a time...
I had a little bunny rabbit.
His name was Teddy.
He looked real cute nibblin 'on Angela' s ear.
But you' re no bunny rabbit, and picturing you do it... really fuckin 'razzes me.
But don' t let me stop you.
Nibble, Teddy.
lf this is some kind of... weird voodoo thing... and you want me to have sex with your wif e, there' s absolutely no way.
Start nibblin ', motherfucker!
Now!
- [Metal Crashes]
That' s it.
Hop like a bunny.
Don' t be shy.
Good boy.
What' s the problem, Sparky?
No whiz left in the cheese?
- [Man Exhales]
It' il be over soon.
Then you can go home to Mommy,
- Theodore.
- Ted!
The name' s Ted.
Yes, my mother did me the disservice of naming me Theodore, and I haven' t a clue as to how you know that, because everybody who knows that... is thousands of fucking miles away.
Have you any idea, the f aintest idea, what it' s like to arrive at school and find yourself surrounded by the maladjusted?
And there you stand.
Little Lord Fauntleroy.
Ever worn a bonnet?
Give it a try sometime.
let alone...
Theo... the Thumper.
Sigfried.
What?
That' s my name.
- Sigfried.
- Sigfried?
Nice to meet ya.
Very impressive,
Ted.
- It' s a deal, kid.
Ted it will be.
My heart!
Aah!
My... nitro pills in the bathroom!
Quick!
Hurry!
Next to the condoms!
They may be in my medicine bag!
This is it!
Oh, this is the big one, Angie!
Dear God!
Someone turn on the lights!
- Nitro.
Nitro.
Nitro.
- Oh, baby, I got the chills!
I can' t f eel my leg!
It' s fucked up!
Nitro!
Where' s the fuckin 'white lightning?
Can' t live without my --
- Help me!
No time to take a leak!
- Help!
Help me!
Good evening.
I' m stuck in a situation here... which I couldn' t possibly begin to explain.
Do you think you could, uh, call the police, sir?
Sir?
lce.
[Ted]
Sigfried.
Sigfried!
- [Muffled Shouting]
Angela!
Where is the fucking nitro?
- Couldn' t find it.
- What do you mean, you couldn' t find it?
Untie me!
I' il find it!
It' s your f ault he' s so upset!
Now he' s dying!
I' il get some help!
I tie a pretty good knot, don' t I, Ted?
Thank God, you' re okay!
- [Both Gasp]
Aw, honey.
Don' t get mad.
It was just a little test, and I' m glad that I did it, because now I know... you love me f orever, truly... and deeply.
lying out on the floor is love, then no wonder we find ourselves as we are at this very moment.
Oh, no.
I heard genuine care in your voice.
Can' t be denied, can it, Ted?
I think you' il go a long way to resolving this misunderstanding.
You' d be surprised what happens if people just listen... without succumbing to all that pain and anger.
You heard shit, monkey boy.
Easy f or you to say after you fuck another man' s wif e.
- You should at least have the guts to stand behind... your convictions.
She' s lying, Sigfried.
I swear to God.
You know, when I think of all the times you were inside me... promising me a better lif e, it makes me wanna puke.
Why are you doing this to me?
What have I ever done to you people?
What didn' t you do, stick man?
Unf ortunately, you don' t have the balls to back up the actions of your huge cock.
[Chuckling Nervously]
- [Chuckles]
Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Show it to me.
[Chuckling]
Put it this way:
God made up f or what he did to Gumby with Teddy here.
Show it to me!
- Show him your cock, Theodore.
- Please stop talking about his cock!
Well, it' s hard to stop talking about something that' s so huge.
- [Gasping]
Please don' t go!
'cause I was up at this party, and --
I have absolutely no idea!
Whoa!
- [Sigfried]
Well, you' re right on time, Theodore.
Let' s not beleaguer the f act... that you have no sense of timing.
you' re here.
Front desk.
Bottle of champagne.
Stand still.
I said stand still.
You' re gonna ruin your suit.
Come here.
Come here.
Gimme that.
Let me see.
There.
There, you see?
You see?
You look good with your hair back like this.
Like me.
Like me.
like your mother likes to comb it.
No.
No.
- [Whispers]
Gimme this.
lmpossible.
You' ve got your mother' s hair.
You can' t do anything with it.
There.
Go.
How did you get your hair in such a tangled mess, huh?
There.
Go.
Finished.
Are we gonna have fun tonight?
I didn' t think so.
Hey.
What about leaving the kids here?
- Here in the room, all by themselves?
No, with the television.
You wanna have fun tonight, don' t you?
Yes.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Hey.
You kids are gonna stay here watching TV.
I want you to be in bed and asleep bef ore 12: 00.
- [Whispers]
- Your mother and I will be back later on, maybe.
Don' t misbehave.
Why did we have to get all dressed up if we' re not going with them?
I don' t know.
- What are you doing?
- I' m escaping.
It stinks in here anyway.
What did I say?
Behave.
Yes, Papa.
The champagne you ordered, sir.
Too late.
Leave it on ice.
But I want some now.
There' il be plenty f or you at the party, baby.
You can bomb yourself all you want at the party.
Put it down.
Put it down.
All right.
- You want 500 bucks?
- Sure.
- How about three?
- Three hundred dollars?
- Yeah.
- Three' s fine.
Good.
My children are staying here tonight watching TV.
I want you to check up on them every 30 minutes.
- Check up on them?
- Yeah, make sure they' re all right.
Make sure they' re f ed.
Make sure they go to bed.
You know, these things.
Sir, I can send out f or a baby- sitting service.
No.
I don' t trust baby- sitters.
I don' t know from the man in the fucking moon.
What about him?
What makes you think you can trust him?
Tell me that' s not a f ace you can trust.
I' d love to help you with your problem, sir, but unf ortunately I' m here alone tonight.
One hundred, two hundred, three hundred.
Here you are.
- I thought you said 500.
- No, I said 300.
No, sir.
I distinctly heard you say 500.
- Are you calling me a liar?
- No, sir.
What I' m saying is that you accidentally f orgot that the first thing you said --
But what I last said was 300, and what you say last is what counts.
- Well, then, if you say 500 one last time, we have a deal.
- You fucking with me, pendejo?
No, sir, but I' m by myself, and looking after your kids is a pain in the ass I don' t need.
Are you calling my kids a pain in the ass?
Why, no, sir, not the kids.
It' s the situation that is a pain in the ass.
No, you were right the first time.
They' re a pain in the ass.
All right.
You win, tough guy.
Five hundred.
You kids are getting expensive.
What' s your name?
Ted.
lf you need anything, just dial zero and ask f or Ted.
- And make sure they' re in bed bef ore midnight.
- Bef ore midnight?
Then should I wake them up f or the countdown to the New Year?
No.
lf something happens to my children...
I wouldn' t want to be you.
Don' t misbehave.
Let' s get out of here.
Okay.
These are the rules.
Don' t break the rules and I won' t break your necks.
I always wanted to say that.
Someone said that to me when I was a kid.
Only they weren' t joking.
The rules are simple:
Don' t do anything you wouldn' t do if your parents were here.
lf there' s an emergency, call me on the phone like your dad said.
Thank you.
That' s not what he said.
He said to call you if we need anything.
Well, I have a lot of work to do, and I can' t have you calling me... every time you want a glass of water, so please, try and limit your calls to emergencies only.
- Thank you.
- We paid you $500.
We' il call you if we need anything.
You don' t wanna get my dad mad.
Oh.
Well, try and call only when necessary.
I' il bring you up some milk and cookies.
Bye, now.
Your f eet stink.
They don' t stink.
Check it out!
Change it.
You' re not supposed to watch this.
- We' re supposed to watch TV.
- Not this kind of TV.
Change it.
Leave me alone.
Ouch.
Ouch.
Front desk.
- Ted?
- What did I tell you?
Don' t bother me and you' il get milk and cookies.
Now, do you want them or do you not?
I want you to turn off the nudie station in our room.
I cannot turn on an adult station without the express permission of your parents.
No, not turn it on.
Turn it off.
- It' s already on.
- Whoa.
- That' s not what the machine tells me.
Well, stop listening to the machine and listen to me.
There' s naked ladies dancing on my TV, and I want 'em off.
Like I said, I' il be up later to put you both to sleep.
Bye.
Change the channel now!
Man, you' re the one with the stinking f eet.
They don' t stink.
- Yeah, they do.
- No, they don' t.
Here, smell f or yourself.
Go ahead.
- [Laughter On TV]
Don' t shake it.
- Front desk.
- Ted?
Hi, it' s me, Sarah.
Who died?
No one?
Good.
Then don' t call me.
I just thought I' d tell you that your cleaning ladies are doing a bum job.
There' s all kinds of leftover stuff here: needles and things.
We' re not supposed to have needles, are we?
I mean, they don' t come with the room, do they?
Send someone up here to clean this place up right.
I told you not to shake it!
I gotta go.
My dumb brother just exploded the champagne all over the room.
Oh, and bring us up a couple of toothbrushes.
There' s a card in the bathroom that says you' il bring us free toothbrushes if we ask f or them.
I' m calling a room.
Give me three numbers.
- [Dialing Phone]
- Hello?
What?
Hi.
You don' t know me, and I don' t know you either, but do you have any needles?
We have needles here, and I was wondering if they come with the room or not.
We ain' t got no needles here, kid.
- No?
- Just a big fuckin 'gun.
Just checking.
This is the bull' s- eye.
It' s worth 100 points.
This is worth ten points.
This is worth 20 points.
This is worth -- Hey, wait 'til I get out of the way!
This is how an expert throws it.
Hello, kiddie- winkies.
I brought your milk and cookies.
You' re going to have to eat them now, because... you' re going to sleep.
We have to go to sleep now?
Your parents said to put you to bed bef ore midnight.
Maybe this way you' il leave me alone.
Those aren' t milk and cookies.
Well, we ran out of cookies, so I brought you milk and saltines.
Now, don' t complain.
Hurry up and eat.
You' re going to bed.
They' re old.
Dip them in the milk.
The milk will make them soft.
No crackers?
Sleepy time.
Now, I don' t want you wandering around, so if you need the rest room --
What about our pajamas?
You wanna look nice in case there' s an earthquake, don' t you?
- [Both]
- Well, then, stay in those clothes.
This is some Mentholatum ointment.
Now, under the covers and close your eyes, and I' il tell you a story.
Your dad says he hates baby- sitters, doesn' t trust 'em.
Well, can' t say I blame him, really.
You know what my baby- sitter did to me when I was a kid?
I used to hate going to sleep.
You know, when it' s late, you wanna get up, run around, go crazy.
Well, what my baby- sitter used to do to me... to make sure I' d stay in bed, not be tempted to get up, was she' d take some of this vapor rub ointment...
and she' d dab a little on each eyelid... just to make sure I' d stay put.
There.
Now you have some too.
Don' t open your eyes or it' il burn, burn, burn.
- What about in the morning?
- Well, if you keep... your eyes shut tight all night, it' il wear off by morning, but don' t open them bef ore then.
Did you ever open your eyes?
Yes, I did, and look at me now.
- [Both]
We can' t.
Good.
You' il do fine.
Sleep tight all night... and I won' t tell your parents about the champagne.
Good night.
Are you watching TV?
Yep. lf you wanna watch, you better go wash your f ace.
- Be careful.
- [Sniff s]
Shut up.
You!
Shut up!
- Ted!
- What do you want now, f or Christ sakes?
Who died?
I don' t know, but she' s in my bed.
- What?
- There' s a dead body in my bed.
Nonsense!
That' s just your brother sound asleep!
No!
There' s a woman' s dead body inside the bed in the mattress.
- You saw the body?
- Yes!
lmpossible!
You' ve got the ointment on your eyes.
Ya can' t see shit!
Now go to sleep!
- Go to sleep!
- I washed it off.
- The Mentholatum?
- Yeah.
Didn' t you ever think to do that?
Get your ass up here and call the police, because there' s a dead body in my bed, and it smells like shit, and it looks even worse.
I swear to fucking God!
- [Dial Tone]
lf there is no dead body in that room by the time I get up there, I' m gonna make one!
- You -- - [Dial Tone]
Little bitch.
Ah, shit!
Cover it up.
Cover it up.
Thank you.
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck is going on here?
Your parents are on their way up here.
And I am not taking responsibility f or this mess!
- Check under the mattress.
- For what?
- For the body.
Can' t you smell it?
- It' s your f eet.
What the fuck is that?
Police!
It' s an emergency!
Get someone over here right fucking now.
- There' s a dead whore stuff ed in the mattress!
- Don' t call her that.
Shut up!
I' m dead fucking serious.
- There' s a dead fucking whore stuff ed...
- Stop calling her that! in the fucking bed!
Fuck!
Did they misbehave?
Emergency?
[Muttering Continues]
Happy New Year.
- Let me speak to Betty.
- Uh, party' s over.
She probably went home.
- She lives there!
I know her.
Well, then get her on the phone.
Tell her it' s an emergency.
Who -- Who should I say is calling?
You tell her it' s Teddy from work on the phone.
I got some major fucking emergency.
Hi, Ted.
I' m Margaret.
You sound down.
Has this not been the happiest of New Years?
No, Margaret.
This hasn' t been my happiest New Year.
This one' s starting off pretty fucking badly.
- Aw, how come?
I' m fucked by a coven of witches.
You were fucked by an oven full of witches?
A coven of witches!
Not an oven!
Well, one witch in particular.
Was she an old hag with a mole on her f ace with hair growing out of it?
No, no, she was very beautiful.
[Gasps]
What' s the problem?
Well, admittedly, that was the best part of the evening.
It was pretty bloody good actually.
But it' s still a pretty unnerving way to start off the night.
Sounds like a pretty great way to start off the night to me.
- Why don' t we just skip over the witches?
- Skipping the witches.
Right.
Later, in another room, some crazy fucking maniac sticks a gun in my f ace... and f orces me to play out some psychosexual drama with his wif e.
He made you have psycho sex with his wif e?
No, he didn' t make me fuck his wif e.
He thought I fucked his wif e.
- He held me at gunpoint with a loaded gun!
- What kind of gun was it?
I don' t know.
I' m not a gun guy.
It was big.
- Was it like Dirty Harry' s gun?
- Yeah, sort of like that, yeah.
Did it have a real long barrel or a short barrel?
What diff erence does it make?
Well, f or one thing, it' s a diff erence between a. 44 Magnum and a Magnum. 357.
Who the fuck cares whether it was a. 44 or a. 392?
It was a big fucking gun!
It was loaded!
And it was pointed right at my fucking head!
- You wanna skip this part too?
- I want you to get Betty on the phone right fucking now.
Hold on.
Anybody live here named --
What' s her name again?
- Betty.
- Betty!
Whatcha screaming about?
- You' re Betty?
- Yeah, I' m Betty.
It' s my fucking place.
- Who the fuck are you?
- I' m Margaret.
And this is Ted.
- You guys, wanna go to breakf ast?
- No.
- Let' s go to Denny' s.
- Later.
- Hello, Betty.
"What' s the problem?"
I haven' t got a problem.
- I' ve got fucking problems.
Wanna hear?
- Sure.
Well, most recently, there' s room 309.
There' s this scary Mexican gangster dude pokin 'his finger in my chest.
There' s his hooligan kids snapping their fingers at me.
There' s a putrid, rotting corpse of a dead whore stuff ed in the springs of the bed.
There' s rooms blazing afire.
There' s a big f at needle from God knows where, stuck in my leg, inf ecting me with God knows what.
And finally, there' s me, walkin 'out the door right fuckin' now.
- Buenas noches.
- [Buzzing]
- [Buzzing]
- Yes, it is.
It' s the Chester Rush party.
They want something.
Well, tough titty.
They' re just gonna have to whistle, because I' m off.
Now, Ted, wait a minute.
I know you' re freaked.
I know you' re stressed.
You had a real bad night.
- Oh, yes, Betty.
- [Buzzing Continues]
The only thing I ask is that you take care of Chester Rush, and then you can leave.
- I don' t f eel like it!
- Ted, he' s a very important guest of the hotel.
ln f act, he' s the most important guest of the hotel.
The Mon Signor used to be a haven f or movie stars.
Through the Thirties, Forties and first half of the Fifties, more movie stars, if you break it down on a night- by- night basis, stayed at the Mon Signor than any other hotel in Hollywood.
Now, we had some hard times in the Eighties, even though we were the official hotel of Cannon Pictures, but we' re comin 'back strong in the Nineties.
And a movie star clientele is important to that comeback.
- Now, you look here -- - He probably just wants some champagne.
You can do that, can' t you?
Ted.
Just take care of him.
The entire staff of the Mon Signor is begging you.
- Okay.
- [Buzzing Continues]
- [Phone Slams Onto Receiver]
Hello, Mr. Rush.
Sorry f or the delay.
How can I help you?
Get your skanky asses the fuck outta here!
Room service.
Hello, Theodore.
- What the f- fuck are you doing here?
- Havin 'a drink.
ls Sigfried here?
Are you kidding?
He' il probably be asleep 'til Christmas.
Hey, everybody.
The bellboy is here.
The bellboy' s here!
Oh, my God!
Shit!
- Happy New Year!
Entra!
Hey, bellboy!
Mr. Rush, I' m sorry I' m late.
But I, l think you' il find I have everything you need.
No problema, el bellboy.
No problema.
- His name is Theodore.
- Actually, it' s not Theodore.
It' s Ted.
- It' s Ted, sir.
- So, Ted, the bellboy, would you care f or some champagne as I was saying?
All right, that wasn' t what I was saying.
- But would you care f or some champagne?
- Um, I' m on duty, sir.
Duty, smooty, come on.
It' s like Cristal.
It' s the very best they make.
I didn' t like champagne 'til I had Cristal.
Now I love it.
- Come on!
- lf I must, sir.
- Yes.
- Chin- chin.
For our purposes, promptness is f ar behind thoroughness.
Drink up, lad.
What do you say?
- Ah, thank you, sir.
No, not thank you.
What do you say about the tasty beverage?
Um, oh, it' s very good.
It' s fucking good, Ted.
Fucking good!
- Let' s try it again, shall we?
- Got a light?
Okay, so, Ted, what do you think about that tasty beverage?
It' s fucking good!
It' s fucking Cristal.
Everything else is piss.
Bellboy.
Bellboy!
Shut up.
Shh!
Shut up!
You' re makin 'my friend Ted nervous.
Chill out, dude.
Pay no attention to Norman here.
He' s just fuckin 'with you.
I think of The Bellboy with Jerry Lewis.
- Did you ever see that film, Ted?
- Um... no, sir.
Oh, you should.
It' s one of Jerry' s better movies.
He doesn' t say a word through the entire film.
It' s a completely silent perf ormance.
Now how many actors can pull that off?
I gotta tell you, that guy, he' s gotta go to France to get respect.
That says it all about America right there.
Just that one little sentence says it all about America right there.
The minute Jerry Lewis dies, every newspaper in this fuckin 'country... is gonna be writin' articles callin 'the man a genius.
It' s not right.
It' s not right and it' s not fuckin 'f air!
But why should that surprise anybody?
When the hell has America ever been f air?
We might be right every once in awhile, but we' re very rarely f air.
Um... where shall I put this, sir?
You in a hurry there, Ted?
Uh, well, um -- Not particularly.
Good there!
Okay, then gotta stop playin '"Beat the Clock."
Okay.
Let me introduce you to everybody.
Now, see that girl over there?
All right, that' s our friend from downstairs.
We just met her at the pool.
You seem to be acquainted.
Yeah, Theodore and I go way back, don' t we, Theodore?
Actually, the name' s Ted, Angela.
I only let people with loaded guns pointed at my head call me Theodore.
The man sittin 'in this chair with the Jim Beam in his hand, yellin' "Bellboy" at you is Norman.
- [Blowing Party Favor]
- What' s up, Ted?
- What' s up, sir?
And the sociable son of a bitch in that room over there is Leo.
And the person on the other end of the phone is his lovely wif e Ellen.
- Leo!
- What?
- Say hello to Ted the bellboy.
- Hold on a second.
What?
- Say hello to Ted the bellboy.
- Here.
Come here.
- Leo, that is Ted the bellboy.
- That' s me.
The bellboy we called about 20, 25 minutes ago.
Oh, Ted the bellboy.
Well, my goodness.
- Glad you could make it, chum.
- Glad I could be here.
- Ellen, what does punctuality have to do with love?
- Which brings me to me.
- Could you explain that to me, please?
Chester Rush, Ted.
Pleased to meet ya.
- I' m pleased to meet you, sir.
- Oh, Chester.
Not "sir."
Chester.
Oh, Chester.
- [Chuckles]
Um, terribly sorry I haven' t seen the movie yet, sir, but --
No worries.
No worries at all.
Don' t worry.
Don' t be sorry about that.
You know, it' s just, that' s why God invented video.
No problem.
- You got a point, sir.
- But you know what?
A lot of people did see it.
Whole lot of motherfuckers saw that movie.
- Didn' t they?
Didn' t they?
- A whole lot --
- [Blows Party Favor]
The Wacky Detective, sir.
- Who drank out of this bottle last?
- Uh?
I said, "Who drank out of this bottle last?"
- What the fuck' s wrong?
- It' s fuckin 'flat, man.
That' s what' s fuckin 'wrong.
Goddamn Cristal is fuckin 'flat.
There ain' t a goddamn bubble left in the fuckin 'bottle, man.
- Jesus Christ!
What the fuck is goin 'on here?
- Chill out, man.
Who fuckin '-- Who -- Fuck -- Who didn' t put the cork in the bottle?
All right?
Somebody!
I didn' t do this!
I was drinkin 'out of that other bottle there.
Somebody didn' t put the fuckin 'cork in the bottle.
Who didn' t put it in?
- Chester, do you want me to open another bottle of champ -- - Who didn' t put it in?
Do you want me to open another bottle of champagne?
No, don' t you fuckin 'open another bottle!
l- l- I got enough right here.
Fucking shit, man.
God, we' ve opened enough fucking bottles!
No!
You don' t.
- Yes, I do.
No!
You don' t!
No!
You don' t!
'Cause it' s fucking free, man.
It' s just fucking free to you fucking assholes.
Shit.
I give and I give and I give and I give and I give.
What was I talkin 'about?
- Um, you were saying that The Wacky Detective... was a very popular movie.
Yes, it was.
And it was popular -- very, very popular -- bef ore video.
It was popular bef ore f oreign!
It was popular bef ore p- pay TV.
And bef ore free TV.
Bef ore all that shit!
- The Wacky Detective was making -- - Ellen, I' m sorry, okay?
Leo!
Leo.
- Ellen, I' m sorry.
That' s fucking asses in fucking seats.
You know, it' s not your f ault.
I mean, they hit you both barrels.
But you know, fuck, you know, I just would like a little consideration.
And my new one, The Dog Catcher, which, by the way, is testing right through the ceiling, all right, is projected to gross a hundred.
- The Dog Catcher.
- The Dog Catcher, Chester.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
- That' s the good stuff.
Now, take a look at some of these goodies you brought us, okay?
But I was just wondering if you could tell me, what is all that stuff f or?
Hey, one thing at a time, man.
I' m not a frog, and you' re not a bunny.
- So let' s not jump ahead.
- Very good, sir.
I think you might want to look at some of this shit.
Hey, you damn skimpy.
All right, men.
All right, man.
Tell it.
A block of wood.
Continue.
- Three nails.
- Why three nails?
That' s how many Peter Lorre asked f or.
Continue, Ted.
A ball of twine.
Well, that is definitely a ball of twine.
Continue!
- [lce Clattering]
- You into it?
- I' m into it.
All right.
Go on!
- A doughnut.
- That' s f or me.
- A club sandwich.
- That is mine.
And... a hatchet!
"A hatchet as sharp as the devil himself," is what I asked f or.
Well, sir -- Chester -- you be the judge.
No, no, no, no, no.
I' il be the judge.
- Careful, sir.
- What do you think?
It' s a sharp motherfucker.
Forget the nails and the twine.
Come on.
- Let' s go.
Pronto, man.
Go ahead.
- Right you are, sir.
- Norman?
Yeah?
Yes, it' s my job.
Yes, it' s my fucking job.
You know that.
He wanted to stay out late.
I can' t -- I went to the Monkey Bar, all right?
Don' t yell -- I' m not yelling!
I' m not yellin '!
You' re the one that' s fuckin 'yellin'!
Fuck -- Don' t hang up on me!
Please don' t hang up on me.
Goddamn it!
I swear to fucking God, if you hang up on me --
You cock- fucking New York bitch.
Fuckin 'call better be genuine,' cause I' m gonna get a divorce!
Yo, Leo?
- Fuck!
- Another fucking Honeymooners goin 'on in there.
- Fuckin ', fuckin' shit, man!
What the fuck is wrong -- What the fuck is wrong with the fuckin 'bitch, man?
I' m gonna take the fuckin 'car.
I' m gonna drive up to fuckin 'Mulholland.
I am gonna fuckin 'drag her fuckin' ass and throw her down Benedict fuckin 'Canyon, man!
- Yeah.
I don' t fucking know anymore.
I swear to Christ, Norman.
I fuckin 'swear to God, man.
You know that, man.
- I know that.
- So I had a little fuckin 'too much to drink!
New Year' s Eve.
I can' t fuckin 'drive home.
Okay, Ellen, I' m sorry.
I' m fuckin 'sorry about that.
What do you want me to do?
Get in a fuckin 'car, and go run over six or seven fuckin' kids?
That' d be real fuckin 'nice.
[Sighs]
Fuck!
What the fuck is all this?
Block of wood, bucket of ice and a hatchet, sir.
Get the fuck outta here.
Chester, talk to me.
Norman?
We now return you to The Man From Rio already in progress.
Oh, my fucking dick is hard already.
- [Norman Laughing]
I am gonna do it.
- Oh, you are my fuckin 'hero.
They better, after talkin 'about it all night.
I wanna see a show.
Come here.
Give me your motherfuckin '-- - All right then.
- Well, if that' s everything.
I got Cedars lined up, man.
I got a doctor waitin 'in the fuckin' emergency.
Fuck the emergency, man.
I' m gonna grab his motherfucking car from him.
Just in case.
Hey, just in fucking case.
- I' il just be off back downstairs, sir.
- Not so f ast.
- Fuckin 'treat that bitch like a queen, man.
- We' re gonna walk back...
- to this little bar here.
- I told you to dump her, didn' t l?
We' re gonna sit down, 'cause we ain' t quite through yet.
Leo.
Sit on this little red stool.
Sit down on this little red stool, while I explain the f estivities of the evening to you.
- All right.
- Um, sir?
- Uh- huh.
- A word in your ear, sir.
- Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.
- Excusez- moi.
- I treat that bitch like a queen, man.
- Chester.
That shit don' t help, treating a woman like a queen.
- I' m fuckin 'working.
I don' t give a fuck what you do.
Gonna take your kids and house.
- As f ar as I' m concerned, go ahead, trash the place!
Oh, but, look, let me explain what we' re talkin 'about.
Sir, sir, you don' t have to explain anything to me.
Whatever constitutes a good time, as f ar as you guys are concerned, that' s your business.
Well, no, it' s your business too, Ted, because we want you to take part.
- Take part in what, sir?
Chester, your way of breakin 'the news to him gently is scarin' the fuck outta him.
- Think so?
- Just spit it out.
Okay.
Thing is, Ted, first off, there' s nothing homosexual about what we want you to do.
I mean, I was thinkin 'you might be thinkin'... that we want you to do somethin 'like weird sex thing, you know, like, suck us off, pee on us, shit like that.
Nothing, nothing could be further from the truth.
- No.
No.
My kind of way of telling him is kind of going all around the world.
- Yeah, well, I see that.
But he' s been here f or 15 minutes and you have, you know, talked about everything but --
- What do you care?
- Why don' t you just shut the fuck up, bitch?
- "Bitch"?
- Bitch!
Uh, excuse me, aren' t you the one who' s being paid to suck his cock, cork boy?
- Whoa!
Business card!
- [Spoon Tapping Glass]
Excuse me, if it please the court.
Allow me to present our intentions to Theodore.
- I second the nomination.
- I move that nomination be closed!
- Thank you.
- The court is yours, Leo.
Thank you very much, Chester.
- Ted, you ever seen any of them old Alfred Hitchcock episodes?
- Yes, sir.
You ever see the one called The Man From Rio with Peter Lorre and Steve McQueen?
- Uh -- - Ah, if you saw it, you' d remember it.
It' s called The Man From Rio with Peter Lorre, Steve McQueen.
Anyway, Peter Lorre makes a bet with Steve McQueen... that Steve McQueen can' t light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row.
Now, if Steve McQueen lights his cigarette lighter ten times in a row, he wins Peter Lorre' s new car.
Peter Lorre gets to chop off Steve McQueen' s little pinky.
Norman and Chester here just made that same bet.
Norman has bet his pinky... that he can light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row.
lf he does, he wins Chester' s 1964 Chevy Chevelle... red, fuckin ', beautiful car.
lf he doesn' t, chop off his fuckin 'pinky.
What do you say?
You guys are drunk.
- Yes!
Of course we' re drunk!
Teddy, that' s why we' re here, but that does not mean... that we don' t know what the fuck we' re talking about.
I' m gonna tell you what the fuck I' m talkin 'about.
I' m gonna tell you what the fuck I' m talkin 'about.
I drive a motherfucking Honda that my sister sold me.
You hear what I' m saying?
A little white motherfuckin 'Honda Civic!
You see this shit?
- "Hollywood' s hottest new star -- - That' s me. next to America' s hottest old car.
- That' s the car I own.
Are you?
Goddamn shit!
Are you listening to me?
Now you take a good long look at that there machine... that this motherfucker over here' s standin 'next to.
That' s a 1964 nigger- red, ragtop Chevy Chevelle.
And I love that car more than I love hips, lips or fingertips.
Cut to:
We' re sittin 'here celebratin', gettin 'high,
- drinking champagne -- - Drinking Cristal.
When you' re drinking champagne, you' re drinking champagne.
When you' re drinking Cristal, you say you' re drinking Cristal.
Whatever that pissity- ass thing is, we are drinking it, you know.
- [Murmurs]
Hey, hey, hey.
we flip on Steve McQueen, Peter Lorre being fuckin 'badasses.
- Badass!
- Badasses!
And I look over at this funny- looking motherfucker over here, and I say, "I' d do that f or the Chevelle."
- I' m funny.
- And that' s when Chester says --
"Oh, really?"
Well, you guys wouldn' t be doing something this stupid unless you were really fucking drunk.
We already told you we were drunk, Ted.
That goes without motherfucking saying.
'Cause if we wasn' t drunk, we' d probably chicken out.
When you' re fucked up, you don' t lie.
Man, you tell the fuckin 'truth.
You want to know what the fuckin 'truth is?
The fuckin 'truth is, my lucky Zippo is gonna win me...
Chester' s fucking car.
Which brings us to your part in this little wager, Ted.
I don' t have a part, sir.
Like my old granddaddy used to always say,
"The less a man makes declarative statements, the less apt he is to look f oolish in retrospect.
- That' s quite brilliant, sir.
- Ah, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thing is, there are some inherent obstacles in this undertaking.
Aside from the obvious.
First of which is being the f act that I' m not like Peter Lorre on that TV show.
I' m not some sick fuck travelin 'the countryside collecting fingers.
All right, you know, we' re all buddies here.
No one wants Norman to lose his finger.
We just want to chop it off.
You know, if f ate doesn' t smile on old Norman, we' il put that fucker on ice, whisk it right to the hospital, where in all likelihood they' il be able to sew it right back on.
Well, hopefully, sir.
They can sew Norman' s pinky back on.
- Yeah, how hard can it be?
- Yeah, good point.
So, Norman, he' s, he' s taken care of, you know.
His interests have been looked after.
My interests, on the other hand, have not.
I am as emotionally attached to my car as Norman is physically to his finger.
That' s a very fuckin 'piece of expensive machinery I' m putting on this wager.
That' s fine.
That' s no problem.
I have no problem with that.
I knew exactly what the hell I was doing.
All right?
lf Norman lights his cigarette lighter ten times in a fuckin 'row, he' s gonna have no emotional problems whatsoever about taking my car keys.
- But if I win, well, it' s not inconceivable that at the last minute... maybe neither Leo or I... will be able to... wield the axe.
- A hatchet, sir.
- Wield the hatchet.
Which brings us full circle to you, Ted.
- Clear- eyed Ted.
Sober Ted.
Complete- stranger Ted.
lmpartial Ted.
Just- met- us- and- couldn' t - give- a- fuck- about- us Ted.
We want you to be the dice man.
Hell of a night, huh, Ted?
I' ve got to get out of here.
Money!
Ted, I got a $100 bill here with your name on it, whether you do what we ask or not.
Just to sit back down in that chair f or one minute more.
I am not gonna cut off Norman' s little pinky!
Well, maybe you will and maybe you won' t.
But that has nothin 'to do with this $100 bill in my hand.
ln f act, you can tell us all to go fuck off and walk right out that goddamn door.
But if you wait 60 seconds bef ore you do it, you' re gonna be $100 richer.
Ted, you' re gonna do whatever you wanna do.
All we' re askin 'is that you indulge us f or one minute more.
My friend Chester here is willing to pay you f or that minute.
Ted, take the money.
Now, let me get this straight.
I sit on that stool, listen to what you have to say f or 60 seconds,
- [Chester]
Correct.
And afterwards I can walk out that door, no hard f eelings?
None whatsoever.
You got a deal.
- Yes!
Yes, yes, yes,!
Ted, good answer.
Sit right down.
Leo, you be the timekeeper.
Norman, give me your watch.
Let me know when a minute ends and when it begins.
- Ah.
- Okay.
- Gentlemen, start your engines.
- Begin.
- Okay, Ted, pay attention here.
I' m gonna make two piles here on the bar.
One pile which is yours.
And another pile which could be yours.
And what you have to realize is we' re gonna do this thing... one way or the other.
Whether it' s you who holds the axe or a Mexican maid... or some bum we yank off the street.
- Shh!
I' m the closer here.
I' m a little me -- Um, I' ve lost count.
- [Group]
Six hundred.
Ted, do you know how long it takes the average American to count to 600?
It' s a rhetorical question, Ted.
- No, sir.
About one minute less than it takes to count to 700.
Now, Ted, a person' s lif e is filled with a zillion little experiences.
Some which are insignificant, have no meaning, and, you know, you f orget them.
Others which you remember f or the rest of your natural lif e.
Now, since what we' re proposing here is so unusual, so outside the norm, that this is a good bet that this is going to be one of those incidents that sticks.
So, since you' re gonna be stuck remembering this f or the rest of your lif e, you have to decide what that memory will be.
So, Ted, are you going to remember f or the next 40 years, give or take a decade, that you refused $1, 000 f or one second' s worth of work?
Or that you made $1, 000 f or one second' s worth of work?
Time!
So, Ted, what' s it gonna be?
- [Group]
Yes!
Always be closing!
- Right here, right now!
Bef ore I change my mind!
Hear, hear.
Let' s go.
- Ahh!
Perf ect, perf ect, perf ect.
This is one of those moments in time... none of us are ever gonna f orget.
- Norman, are you ready?
- I' m ready.
- Ted, are you ready?
- Ready.
Okeydokey.
Norman... begin.
My finger!
My fuckin 'finger!
Chester, my fuckin 'finger, man!
He cut off my fuckin 'finger!
Oh!
[Groans]
My fuckin 'finger, Chester!
He cut off my fuckin 'finger!
Call Cedars, man!
Call fuckin 'Cedars!
Wrap it up!
Could I talk to Don Levine, please?
Why' d you let me do this?
Why' d you let me do this?
What?
What do you mean he' s in surgery?
He was expecting my call.
What?
Who the fuck has plastic surgery at 6: 30 in the morning on New Year' s Eve?
Leo!
- I need you to stand still!
Hold it!
Oh, fuck!
- All right!
- I f orgot the finger!
I gotta get the --
It' s the finger!
I got it!
I got it!
Here!
You' re on it!
Come on, come on!
Here.
Just put some fuckin 'ice in it.
Let' s go!
Let' s go!
Come on!
Get up, get up!
- I' m gonna go back to my room.
- Are you comin 'or not?
- [Group]
Oh!
Close the fuckin 'door!

I' m Frank Dixon, Director of Customs and Border Protection here at JFK.
I help people with their immigration problems.
We' re looking for an interpreter for you.
How are we doing on that?
Do we have an interpreter?
But I understand that you speak a little English.
- Yes.
- You do?
I hope you don' t mind if I eat while we talk.
I' ve a bit of bad news.
Your country has suspended all travelling privileges on passports issued by your government.
And our State Department has revoked the visa that was going to allow you to enter the US.
That' s it in a nutshell, basically.
While you were in the air there was a military coup in your country.
Most of the dead were members of the Presidential Guard.
They got it all on GHN, I think.
There were few civilian casualties.
Mr Navorski, your country was annexed from the inside.
The Republic of Krakozhia is under new leadership.
Krakozhia.
Krakozhia
- Krakozhia.
I don' t think he gets it.
Let me...
Look.
Imagine that these potato chips are Krakozhia.
Kra- kozhia.
- Yes.
- Krakozhia.
So the potato chips are Krakozhia.
- And this apple...
- Big Apple.
OK?
No more Krakozhia!
OK?
New government.
You understand?
All the flights in and out of your country have been suspended.
The new government has sealed all borders, so your visa' s no longer valid.
So, currently you are a citizen of nowhere.
Now, we can' t process you new papers until the US recognizes your country' s new diplomatic reclassification.
You don' t qualify for asylum, refugee status, temporary protective status, humanitarian parole, or non- immigration work travel.
You don' t qualify for any of these.
You are at this time simply...... unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
- Unacceptable.
Big Apple tour includes Brooklyn Bridge, Empire State, Broadway show Cats.
I got more bad news for you.
Cats has closed.
Now I go New York City.
Thank you.
I cannot allow you to enter the United States at this time.
- Krakozhia.
- We can' t allow you to go home either.
You don' t really have a home.
Technically it doesn' t exist.
It' s like a Twilight Zone.
Do you get that show over there?
Talking Tina, Zanti Misfits.
Zanti Misfits was Outer Limits, sir.
It' s not important.
Where do I buy the Nike shoes?
OK, Mr Navorski, come here.
Here' s my dilemma, Mr Navorski.
You have no right to enter the US and I have no right to detain you.
You have fallen through a crack in the system.
- Yes.
Until we get this sorted out,
I will allow you to enter the International Transit Lounge.
- Free?
Free to go anywhere you like in the International Transit Lounge.
- OK?
- OK.
- OK.
- OK.
OK.
Uncle Sam will have this sorted out by tomorrow, and welcome to the United States.
Almost.
- Thank you.
- OK.
Mr Navorski.
This is the International Transit Lounge.
You are free to wait here.
These are food vouchers.
You can use them in the Food Court.
Your Krakozhian money is no good here.
This is a 15- minute, prepaid calling card.
You may call home, if you like.
This, in case we need to contact you, is a pager.
You must keep this with you at all times.
Here is an ID badge for you to get into CBP.
Mr Navorski.
I' m going to need you to look at me.
Beyond those doors is American soil.
Mr Dixon wants me to make it clear that you are not to enter through those doors.
You are not to leave this building.
America is closed.
America closed.
What I do?
Shop.
[TV]... taken hostage.
We' re hearing that the Vice President has been killed along with four cabinet members, 13 injured soldiers and 20 civilians.
By dawn, rebel leaders had surrounded the state houses.
In a symbolic gesture, the national flag of Krakozhia was torn down from the Presidential Palace and the parliament building.
Please.
[Speaks Bulgarian]
Last night a military coup overthrew the government of Krakozhia.
Bombing and gunfire were heard through the night.
Although details are unclear, we are told that President Vagobagin and his aides have been taken hostage.
You are a Red Carpet Club member?
I need to see your boarding pass and club card, sir.
I' m sorry, sir.
This is a private lounge.
The public lounge is downstairs.
- Watch it!
- Please.
Telephone?
Telephone?
Please.
Please.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you broke my bag!
I got this in Paris.
This is my favourite bag.
I can' t believe you just broke my bag!
Mom, Dad!
He broke my bag!
- Excuse me.
Stop it.
Do you have an appointment?
I don' t let anyone to look at my trash without an appointment.
I have an opening next Tuesday.
Tuesday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Tuesday.
It will be good time for you to come back and get lost.
OK, goodbye.
Sorry.
Tuesday.
Don' t shoot!
[Salchak]
Has a 120- volt generator, wet bar, gas range.
She looks amazing.
She' s my pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
She' s a beautiful boat and I hope you get her soon.
- You' ve earned her.
- Thank you, Frank.
- Actually, I bought her yesterday.
Come on.
Congratulations!
I' m nominating you to take my place.
You will assume the duties of acting Field Commissioner until you get approval from Washington.
Really?
I don' t know what to say.
Richard, is this real?
- It' s real, Frank, it' s real.
Don' t pretend to be surprised.
You' ve been waiting for me to retire or drop dead for years now.
No, I haven' t been waiting for you to retire.
[Both laugh]
My retirement will become official the day you get sworn in.
- You' ve waited a long time for this.
Just be careful about the inspection process.
I' ve been here for 17 years...
We' re talking about the Field Commissioner position.
People are going to look to you for leadership, to set an example.
What are you saying?
I' m saying the job is yours to lose.
Ship the Colombians off to asylum hearings, and call the parents of those kids from Long Island.
Tell them it was a bad idea to let them go to Jamaica.
Come on, let' s go.
South America and Madrid are on the tarmac.
I want them out of here in half an hour.
There' s a man walking around the terminal in a bathrobe.
I know, sir.
You put him there.
Welcome to the United States.
I need visa.
I can' t do anything without it.
Go to the wall.
Sir.
The light green form.
Light green.
Mr Navorski, you cannot get into New York without a visa.
You cannot get a visa without a passport, and you cannot get a new passport without a country.
There' s nothing we can do for you here.
I give you light green.
I' m sorry, but you' ve wasted an entire day.
At this time you are simply...
- Unacceptable.
Unacceptable.
Why is he still here?
You released him, sir.
Why doesn' t he walk out the doors?
Why doesn' t he try to escape?
- Sir, you told him to wait.
- I didn' t think he' d actually do it.
I mean, he' s in a crack.
Who the hell waits in a crack?
No news from the State Department, but we can deport him in a few days.
It could be a week, two weeks, a month.
Who knows what this guy is thinking, what gulag he escaped from.
Everything he does comes back to me.
- You want him back in the holding cell?
- No, I' il show him the door.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yes.
Food document, trash.
Tuesday.
Tuesday.
I hate the Tuesday.
Airports are tricky places, Mr Navorski.
Something you can never repeat to anyone.
Do you understand?
It' s a secret.
- Secret?
- Yes, a secret.
At 12 o' clock today, the guards at those doors will leave their posts and their replacements are going to be five minutes late.
Late five minutes.
At 12 o' clock.
Just today.
Just this once.
No one is going to be watching those doors.
- And no one will be watching you.
- So, America not closed.
America, for five minutes, is open.
Have a nice life, Mr Navorski.
It' s simple.
Sometimes you land a small fish.
You set him free so that somebody else can have the pleasure of catching him.
All right, here we go.
OK.
Johnson, clear the doors.
Get out of there.
All right, there' s the door.
Here we go.
Now where is he?
- There he is.
- No, that' s not him.
There he is.
Here we go.
What' s so complicated?
Come on.
In a few minutes, you' il be somebody else' s problem.
He wants to make sure nobody' s watching.
I told him nobody would be watching.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
- Call the Airport Police.
- He' s on his way.
Excuse me.
You got it.
There we go.
He' s got to get a running start, I guess.
Just leave.
Just leave.
Leave.
Leave.
What are you doing?
Why is he kneeling?
No.
He' s tying his shoelace.
Come on, leave.
Where is he?
Where is he?
- [Thurman]
He was at the door.
- All right.
I wait.
What are you looking at?
Thank you.
Oh, God.
Oh, shit.
- This belong you?
- Thank you.
Oh, shit.
Wet floor.
I' m so late.
I can' t remember the gate.
Gate 24.
- You sure?
Thanks.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Wait.
Second floor.
Sensible heels.
- Come here, you.
I think he' s ClA.
The ClA put him here to spy on us.
You don' t know what you' re talking about.
He doesn' t speak English.
He can' t speak English, how could he have a meeting with a beautiful woman?
A flight attendant.
- So, she' s ClA, too?
- No.
She look like a Russian.
And he gave her a piece of the paper.
- Was it microfilm?
- A coupon from Payless Shoes.
Must be some kind of the code.
You been spending too much time inhaling them cleaning products.
I' m warning you guys.
You watch yourself.
This guy is here for a reason.
And I think that reason is us.
Excuse me, buddy.
What' s going on?
He' s figured out the quarters.
Good afternoon.
Welcome to Burger King.
Keep the change.
Go.
Good boy.
Thank you.
Bye- bye.
Welcome to Burger King.
"Crisis.
Crisis in Krakozhia. "
Now that heavy fighting has subsided and both sides have dug in for the long winter ahead, it' s clear that the future of Krakozhia may be in doubt for some time to come.
Meanwhile, the people of Krakozhia suffer the consequences.
"And food... in..."... have caused food and energy shortages. "... in Krakozhia."
"The story of Broadway is the..."
"The cast of comedy hit Friends which is set in New York."
[Speaks Bulgarian]
Friends.
Due to the heavy snowfall, all flights have been cancelled... [all groan]
Next.
Let me ask you something, Mr Navorski.
Why do you wait here every day when there' s nothing I can do for you?
Your new visa will not arrive until your country is recognized by the US.
One red, one green.
- So?
- I have chance to go New York, 50- 50.
That' s a beautiful way to look at it, but America doesn' t work that way.
As acting Field Commissioner, I' ve created a new position here at JFK.
Transportation Liaison for Passenger Assistance.
Sir, what will that person do?
Thank you.
I' il take it from here.
I' m Transportation Liaison in charge of Passenger Assistance.
No quarters, no food.
It' il be days before he goes through the doors in violation of section 2. 14
Then he' s somebody else' s problem.
Why don' t we tag him in violation of section 2. 14 now?
He has to break the law by leaving.
I won' t lie, particularly to get rid of somebody like him.
- [Max]
- Honey!
Put it down.
Put it down.
Put it down.
You try to take my floor.
It' s my job.
Stay away from my mop.
- If you touch it again, I kill you.
I' m Enrique Cruz.
We need to talk.
- I want to make a deal with you.
I need information on CBP Officer Torres.
You feed me information about her and I' il feed you.
- What do you want know?
- You see her every day.
I want to know what makes her knees weak.
What makes her blood boil and her body tingle.
She' s a wild stallion and you' il help me break her.
I' m her man of mystery.

- Her name is Delores.
You help me to win her heart and you' il never go hungry again.
- I do this.
- Really?
Promise?
- Yes.
- OK.
Thank you.
What mean, "wild stallion"?
[Speaks Bulgarian]
Officer Torres.
My friend say you are stallion.
Mr Navorski.

Stand behind the yellow line.
- It' s beautiful horse.
- Who said that?
- My friend drive the food.
- I will help once it' s your turn.

Something wrong with the salmon?

Please.
Thank you.
Officer Torres, you like the films?

Conventions.
What is?
- Conventions.
This is like secret place you go?
She go to these conventions dressed as Yeoman Rand.
- She' s a Trekkie.
Favourite episode is Doomsday Machine.
Now, listen, Viktor.
You can ask her something that is very important.
- OK.
- I wait.
- Enjoy your visit.
Next.
- Officer Torres.

You, no chit.

I won' t cheat.
She won' t take your chitting.
Next.
Have you been ever in the love?
Who is it?
Who' s telling you to ask me these things?
It' s a man of misery.
- Mystery?
Man of misery.
He' s so sick.
He' s so in love.
But what did she say?
She did say, "Next!
And now she say, "Please.
Please come. "
[Shrieks]
- I coming now.
- No, wait.
Viktor.
Viktor, just tell me more.
I coming.
Please, please.
Started beeping.
So, I grab.
[Frank]
We have an idea.
Would you like something to eat?
No food.
I stuffed.
All right.
Thank you.
So, Mr Navorski, I have some very good news for you.
I' ve figured out a way to get you out of this airport.
How?
Well, we have laws here that protect aliens who have a credible fear of returning to their own country.
If we can establish this fear with you, then the CBP will be forced to begin Expedited Removal Procedures, to bring you to an immigration judge and let you plead your case for asylum.
- Asylum?
- Mm- hm, asylum.
Unfortunately, the courts are so backed up with asylum cases that the soonest you' d get before a judge would be six months from now.
Yes, and we would have no choice but to let you go for those six months.
It' s the law.
You would be free to wait in New York until your court date.
But, believe it or not, most people never show up before the judge.
- So I go New York City?
You can go to New York City tonight.
But, you only get to go if we can establish a credible fear.
- Fear?
- Mm- hm, fear.
- Fear.
- Fear.
From what?
That' s the best part.
It doesn' t matter what you' re afraid of.
It' s all the same to Uncle Sam.
So I' m going to ask you one question, if you give me the correct answer, I can get you out of this airport tonight.
Tonight.
- Tonight.
- Tonight.
- [Laughs]
- OK.
Do you, at this time, have any fear of returning to your own country?
No.
Let me try it again.
- Your country' s at war.
- Yes.
War.
Political persecution.
It' s terrible.
- Yeah, it' s horrible.
And God only knows what could happen.
Innocent people are torn from their beds.
On Tuesdays.
I hate Tuesdays.
So you' re afraid.
- Krakozhia.
You' re afraid of Krakozhia.
Krakozhia?
No, I am not afraid from Krakozhia.
I' m a little afraid of this room.
I' m talking about bombs.
Human rights.
Viktor, please don' t be afraid to tell me you' re afraid of Krakozhia.
Is home.
I am not afraid from my home.
So?
I go to New York City now?
- No.
OK.
- I' m afraid from ghosts.
- Thanks very much.
- Thanks a lot.
I' m afraid from Wolfmens, afraid from sharks.
Thanks a lot.
- Why you do this?
- Nobody read the sign in America.
This is the only fun I have.
A barbecue?
That' s why I' m not going to see you?
Let me get this straight.
I change my schedule to meet you.
I take four back- to- back flights, fly 27 hours straight literally around the world, and now you tell me you' re going to spend July 4th with your wife?
The woman hates fireworks.
Don' t lie to me, OK?
I know for a fact you took her to Rome last weekend.
Because you flew United, Max.
You make a habit out of listening to other people' s conversations?
No, I try to call home.
So then...
- You know why men are such assholes?
Because they' re all liars.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wet floor.
Don' t be hurt.
How can I not be?
He' s married.
You want to know what the worst part is?
I never asked him to leave his wife.
I encouraged him to get counselling.
What kind of sick person am I?
I' m rooting for the home team.
I just wish the sex wasn' t so amazing.
- So amazing.
- Bye- bye.
You know... sometimes in the mornings,
Watch him do the crossword puzzle.
I start to think that maybe... maybe this could happen.
That we belong together.
This... man... has you.
Why he need... puzzle?
This is my problem.
I always see men the way I want to see them.
Do I know you from someplace?
Payless Shoes.
Second floor.
You headed for home?
No, no.
I am delayed a long time.
I hate it when they delay flights.
What do you do?
I go from one building to another building.
I have beeper.
Oh, contractors.
You guys travel as much as we do.
Sorry about that.
Thank you very much.
What' s "BH"?
Viktor Navorski.
- In English, Amelia Warren.
- Amelia Warren?
- Nice to meet you.
Nice to see you again.
You like Italian food?
I know, it' s late and you' ve probably got other plans, but if you' d like to grab some dinner, we can run right out and catch a cab.
I know a place that has the greatest cannelloni.
I can' t.
- You married?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
I can' t go out... with you.
I' m so sorry.
I am so sorry.
I must come off like a complete nut job or something.
- No.
- I didn' t want to eat alone.
Wet floor.

Nadia.
In New York restaurant, what cost is cantaloni?
I don' t know.

Yes, this is Viktor Navorski.
It' s Cliff from the Discovery Store.
Hello.
- How' s it going?
- Good.
- Is this a good time?
- Yes, I wait for your call all day.
Well, I got to tell you that the position' s been filled.
Yeah, so could you please go sit someplace else?
- I go to bathroom now.
- That' d be good.
- All right.
[Cliff]
Who is this?
[Worker]
There' s no one here for two weeks.
Look at this cornicing.
This is good work.
Must be Harry' s crew.
You with Harry' s crew?
Does Harry think he' s running this job?
- [Viktor]
Go where?
- Gate 67.
- 67?
We' re ten months away from 67.
He' s got to be Harry' s.
If he' s not mine and he' s not yours...
Harry' s trying to make me look bad.
I' ve got to slow him down before he gets to 67.
- What' s your name?
Pull him off Harry' s crew, put him on mine.
You start 6. 30 Monday morning.
You give me job?
6. 30, yes...
Boss.
We have lobster ravioli from Alitalia.
We have caviar from Russian Aeroflot.
Just bring it.
- Hello, all.
The man without a country.
Come on in.
Welcome.
- I see this.
- You did well.
Have a seat.
- Here?
- Here.
Come on, sit down.
- Who invited him?
- I did.
We needed a fourth, right?
- I' m not going to play with him.
- Gupta, relax, would you?
- He isn' t a spy.
- How do you know?
He could be recording everything we say.
A microphone up in his ass.
- I' m not going to lose my job.
- What if we x- rayed him?
- Yes.
Close your eyes.
So you are clean.
I will have money.
Friday.
We play for unclaimed items from the Lost and Found.
You' il be amazed at what people leave at airports.
I have two nines and two nines.
[Viktor]
Four nines.
- [Enrique]
Yeah, we' re just curious.
What is in the can?
- [Viktor]
We saw the x- ray.
We know there' s no nuts in there.
[Viktor]
This is jazz.
- Jazz?
- Jazz, yes.
- Jazz?
It might be the blues.
- Maybe it' s Stevie Wonder.
- No, no, is jazz.
OK.
For tonight' s grand prize, we have...
Show them, Gupta.
I found this upstairs.
Virgin Air, first class lounge.
And... they belong to?
Cher.
Cher?
Yeah.
Cher.
There were witnesses.
Those are Cher' s panties.
- Ready?
So, will we share the panties?
- Not if I win.
- Wait a second.
[Amelia]
[Amelia]
Well, hi.
[Viktor]
How are you?
I am so sorry about what happened last time, asking you out like that.
I' m so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30, 000 feet that when I meet somebody that doesn' t, I don' t know how to react.
- Let' s just start over.
- Yes, OK.
- Are you coming or going?
- I don' t know.
Both.
Tell me about it.
I read a lot of history books.
They' re long and cheap.
You can' t beat that.
- Yeah.
He' s one of my favourites.
- You know what saved Napoleon' s life?
- No.
- His ego.
- Ego?
Yes.
Napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of Saint Helena.
No one knows exactly what happens next, but the version I like goes like this:
He' s very depressed and decides to take his own life.
But Napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job.
His stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it, and he doesn' t die.
Ego.
Saved his life.
Maybe he need glasses.
- Glasses?
To read words on bottle.
Poison.
It' s funny you should say that.
Rumour has it that Napoleon was farsighted.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- And there you go.
I think we' re rewriting history right here.
Why don' t we talk about it over lunch?
Oh, my God, I can' t believe it.
I just asked you out again.
I just did it again.
Just stay away from me, Viktor, OK?
I' m sick.
I don' t have the ability to be alone for five seconds.
OK.
- OK, what?
- OK.
Lunch... with you.
- You' il have lunch with me?
- Yes.
You' re not running for a flight or...?
I wait.
- You.
I just got paged.
You work?
Crowded.
Stay away from me, Viktor.
I have a serious problem.
I just keep ingesting these poisonous men until I make myself sick.
- You' re not sick, Amelia.
No.
You' re a little... farsighted.
- I have to go.
- I have to stay.
- Me, too.
Your CBP inspection' s in three days.
The FBI and Homeland Security will tour the airport, spend two hours observing these offices before your interview process begins.
How much does Navorski make?
Sir?
How much are they paying him?
They' re paying him cash under the table.
I know that.
How much?
$19 an hour.
Unbelievable.
Do you know that' s more than I make?
That' s New York City construction.
Asked me if I wanted to join the big pool.
Look at him.
Place a bet on when Navorski' s going to leave this airport.
Have you heard about this?
I have January 3rd.
Bring him in.
Jake, he has no nationality.
No country.
He' s a national security risk, according to my interpretation of Section 2. 12.
I want you to put him in a detention centre and run a clearance on him.
What about a federal prison?
What about another airport?
Hello?
Hello?
We' re detaining so many people, there' s no room anywhere.
- Did you try the FBl?
Nobody' il take him.
No.
From now on, Navorski lives here.
The people who are coming here today will be observing me, inspecting me.
But most of all they will be looking at the way that this airport is run.
So let' s show them why this is the number- one airport in the United States.
[Frank]
We process about 600 planes a day, with a processing time of 37 minutes per plane, about 60 seconds per passenger...... to be brought into the country.
We keep it as clean as possible.
- What do you import?
- Computer software.
That' s a lot of walnuts.
My mother- in- law loves these things.
Every time I go to Brazil, I bring her back a bag.
- Your mother- in- law?
Mind if I try one?
How did you know those weren' t for his mother- in- law?
If he' s married, where' s his ring?
And if he' s divorced, who still talks to their mother- in- law?
I' m sorry, but really.
No offence to mother- in- laws, but...
- Sir.
- Yeah.
Sir, we have a situation upstairs.
- It' il have to wait.
This won' t wait.
When the 9. 12 from Toronto landed, they found four prescriptions without an MPL.
They tried to take the pills away and he went nuts.
There he is.
We think they' re for his father.
Sir, sir, calm down.
Put your weapons down.
All right.
We' re here to help you.
Give me the knife.
- Russia.
The only interpreter we got is in Newark.
- We have to get someone to talk to him.
- I have an idea, sir.
Viktor.
- Viktor.
I need your help.
His name is Milodragovich.
He lives near you.
He may not speak your dialect, but I need you to translate and help me out.
Why?
- I don' t want anybody to get hurt.
This guy' s very upset.
Just calm him down and I' il let you back in the terminal.
New York.
Green.
- New York.
- OK, yes.
- You say yes?
- OK.
We have somebody here to talk to you.
Go ahead.
So?
OK, tell him in order to export medicines from this country, he needs to have the proper form, a Medicinal Purchase Licence.
You understand me, Viktor?
He say he bring the medicine for his father.
This why he go to Canada.
Medicine for father.
It doesn' t matter.
His plane landed in the US.
He did not know he need this document.
No one say to him he need document form.
I' m saying it to him.
He needs to have the form signed by the hospital who is treating his father.
These medicines have to stay in the United States.
They have to stay here.
He' s begging you.
I can see that he' s begging.
I' m sorry, sir.
You' il have to take a flight in the morning.
The medicine stays here.
I' m sorry.
[Woman]
Thank you, Viktor.
Good job.
Goat.
- What?
- Goat.
It medicine is for goat.
- Goat?
- Yes.
Medicine is for goat.
- He said that?
- Yes.
He say...
I not understand "goat".
You misunderstood him?
No.
The name for "father"... sound like "goat".
I make mistake.
Why are you doing this, Viktor?
Medicine is for... goat.
- No, it' s not.
- Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
You read the blue immigration form.
- Blue?
Blue.
- Blue?
The blue form.
The one that says if it' s an animal, he doesn' t need the licence.
That' s good, Viktor.
That' s very good.
Why are you doing this?
You don' t know him.
You don' t know the rules.
Look at me.
I was going to help you.
Now I want you to ask him...
No, not you.
I want to hear him say who the medicine is for.
Who the medicine is for.
Answer him, Mr Milodragovich.
Who are the pills for?
OK.
He goes.
That' s it.
Goat.
Please.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Medicine for goat.
Give him the pills.
Medicine...
He love that goat.
Do you think I need an excuse to put you back in that cell to keep you there for five years?
You go to war with me, and you go to war with the United States.
Then you' il know why Krakozhians wait in line for cheap toilet paper while Uncle Sam wipes his ass with Charmin two- ply.
There was a 20 man.
Immigration gun was drawn.
The Dixon was ready to fire.
To kill the little man with the pills.
But then someone walks into the room and stand in front of this little man.
"Put the guns away," the man say.
"Nobody will die today."
Who?
- Yeah, tell us.
Navorski.
Viktor "The Goat" Navorski.
- It doesn' t look good, Frank.
- I was just following the rules.
Sometimes you have to ignore the rules and concentrate on the people.
The people, I know.
The people, compassion.
That' s the foundation of this country.
You could learn something from Navorski.
Cheer up.
It' s not over yet.
- Is that for me?
Yes.
Is Virgin Isle swordfish.
For you.
For you.
For wall.
Fish for wall.
Why do you want to go to New York?
And what' s in the can of peanuts?
Promise.
- A promise in the can?
- Yes.
A promise.
Let me make you a promise, Viktor.
And this is a promise that comes from a man who is stuck here.
A man who may be stuck here for the next ten years.
From now on, you and I are partners.
If I stay, you stay.
Not a single toe in the United States of America.
Do you understand what I am saying to you?
You don' t like fish.
Do you ever feel like you' re just living in an airport?
We don' t have to do this, Viktor.
I can mail you anywhere in the US.
- No.
I can' t do this.
- You said you wanted us to help you.
- I do.
- What' s her name?
Amelia Warren.
I thought we were looking for a way out, not a way in.
Those flight attendants ain' t like regular women.
Flying back and forth between time zones messes with their biological clock.
- They' re always ready for sex.
- OK, I found something.
I am leaving.
They will come for us.
Just watch the door.
For...
Forget it.
- Warren, right?
- Warren.
Amelia Jane Warren?
- Jane?
First class.
- When she come back?
- Three weeks.
Amelia, would you like to get eat to bite?
Bite to eat?
Cantaloni?
Bite to eat?
Bite to eat?
Eat to bite?
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Bite to eat.
Gupta, you been ever married?
- What did you say?
- You been ever married?
I had a wife and two kids in India.
I left them there 23 years ago.
Why?
I had a small tobacco shop in Madras.
Made just enough money to survive.
One day this policeman comes in and tells me I owe him some tax.
This is common.
So I pay him.
The next day, the same policeman come and keep coming and keep coming.
And I am paying and I' m paying him and I' m paying him and I' m paying him.
And finally, on the fifth day, I take a knife and I stab him in his chest.
- You killed policeman?
I just missed his heart.
When they tried to arrest me, I run away.
So you never go home?
If I go home, I go in the jail for seven years.
They deport you.
They have no reason to notice a man like me.
United Airlines Flight 2703 from Rome is now arriving at Gate C43.
- Sorry.
I' m sorry.
It' s wet.
- Watch where you' re going.
Watch out!
- Amelia.
- Viktor.
- Sorry.
I' m sorry.
He nearly killed me.
- You OK?
- I' m fine.
I love the suit.
Hugo Boss.
On sale, $149. 99.
That' s a bargain.
- Napoleon?
And Josephine.
Do you know what Napoleon gave Josephine on their wedding day?
Would you like to have eat to bite?
Tonight?
- You' re asking me out for dinner?
- Yes.
Sure.
What time?
- [Viktor]
Where do you want to go?
I know place.
- Do you have an appointment?
- Navorski.
This way, please.
Thank you.
I didn' t know they had a patio up here.
It' s very nice.
Good night.
Please.
So, tonight we have cannellonis or chicken.
- Cannelloni, please.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
For you, sir?
- That' s a great, great choice.
Let me see.
Enjoy.
Did you know the croissant was invented in Romania?
- Tell me.
It' s 1742 and the Turks invade Bucharest, making a surprise attack under the cover of night.
- [pager beeps]
Sorry.
So, the bakers?
- No, never mind.
It' s a dumb story.
- No, please.
I' m sorry, Viktor.
Nobody really cares where the croissant was invented.
I' il bet the Romanians themselves don' t give a shit.
I care.
Is truth.
- I' m 39 years old.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- You are not.
I tell everybody I' m 33, and most of the men I' ve dated think I' m 27, but no.
I' m 39.
I was 39 once.
I was 18 years old when I started working for the airlines.
I' ve been doing this over 20 years.
And now there' s no more pretending.
This is it.
It' s why my address book is by city and my pager goes off during dinner.
You can switch off pager.
I wish I could.
I' ve been waiting for a phone call for seven years.
I know it' s coming, Viktor.
That' s why I can' t break it off.
That' s why I live out of hotels and have my little suitcase packed, ready to go, just in case he wants to meet me for the weekend.
I' ve been waiting my whole life.
- Just don' t know what the hell for.
I' m so sorry.
[Viktor]
- What?
Gate 67.
- You live at the airport?
Day and night.
They tell me to wait.
So I wait.
All frequent fliers feel the same way you do, Viktor.
Everybody' s waiting.
Everybody.
- For a flight, for a meeting...
- I don' t wait for flight or meeting.
- [Pager beeps]
Is OK.
I understand.
I have an idea.
- Come here.
- What you do?
You sure?
More than anything, I' m sure of this.
Ready?
So, when do you come back?
[Amelia]
How about you?
I will be here.
But what if your schedule changes?
Maybe we should exchange phone numbers.
I will be here.
You know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
Tell me.
Tell me.
13 days from now.
What' s he doing?
I' m supposed to tell him what he' s doing.
If I ask him, I look like an idiot.
Sorry.
You got to do this for me.
You' il get really fat with all the food I' m going to give you.
But, please, do this for me.
It will be the last thing I ask you to do.
He waits for you to answer at Sbarro.
- I have to work.
- He will wait.
[Cheering]
- How was your flight?
- Good.
Thanks.
- Is something wrong?
- You' il have to come with us.
You' re kidding.
I come through here twice a month.
Please follow me.
I' m supposed to be meeting somebody.
The person, the document and the story.
Find the truth of one and you find the truth of all three.
I need your help finding the truth.
Do you know a man named Viktor Navorski?
Yes.
Do you know why he' s here and where he' s from?
We' re just friends.
Have you noticed that he hides a can of Dry Roasted Peanuts in his bag?
So?
What do you make of that?
I' d make peanut butter, I guess.
We know that he' s planning to go to the Ramada Inn on Lexington.
Has he told you why he' s in New York?
No.
- Has he told you where he lives?
We just met at the airport.
That' s it.
- He' s a contractor?
That' s what he said?
I' m just curious.
You are the kind of woman who can get any guy she wants.
Why Viktor Navorski?
That' s something a guy like you could never understand.
I guess you missed your flight again.
Or maybe you have a bad travel agent.
Please.
It' s OK, Viktor.
All men lie.
- At least you' re not very good at it.
You never said it was for nine months.
Maybe you see the man the way you want see the man.
So what am I seeing?
Who are you?
- Unacceptable?
Yes.
You want to hear the funny part?
I broke up with him.
I was coming here to tell you he' s out of my life.
I' m free.
I got tired of waiting.
At least we have that in common.
Amelia, you know what Napoleon give to Josephine when he win Bavaria?
No.
I show you.
Please.
Napoleon to Josephine.
One thousand fountains.
You built this for me?
Sit.
Don' t get wet.
Come on.
It should shoot, big water up to ceiling.
Just tell me the truth.
Did you escape from an institution?
Are you a criminal?
You' re living here, Viktor.
You' re living at Gate 67.
I just want to know why.
I show you.
My father.
Viktor, please tell me your father isn' t in that peanut can.
This is jazz.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, see this photograph in Hungarian newspaper 1958.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
Who are they?
57 of them all together.
He begin to write letters to club, Lickety Split, Snookie' s Sugar Bowl.
Hundreds letters.
And then he wait.
He wait month, week, year.
My father wait 40 year.
And they all sign names.
One by one.
They all write their name and send it to my father.
All but not one.
Benny Golson.
Saxophone.
My father die before Benny Golson write his name and send to my father.
So I make him promise.
I keep promise.
I promise I will go New York, find Benny Golson, have him write name to put in can.
And you' ve been living here so you could do this for your father?
Maybe I think he do it for me.
You say you are waiting for something.
We all wait ".
What are you waiting for?
You.
I wait for you.
What?
The war is over.... the right- wing military coup that ousted President Vagobagin... [all sing the Krakozhian National Anthem in Bulgarian]
Let' s raise your glasses.
Let' s have a toast to my friend, Viktor "The Goat".
- [All bleat]
May he never lose his country again.
Krakozhia!
Amelia!
Hello.
Amelia, look.
Peace, peace in the war.
Come.
See, the war, the war Krakozhia is over.
Peace.
The war is over.
- Yes, yes.
He has a lot of connections.
Here.
It' s a pass, Viktor.
- Wha...
- Yes.
- From your friend?
- Yeah.
Just go to New York, find that last name and put it in the can.
- Yes.
I go New York!
You come with me to New York.
Your friend do this for me?
Why he do this for me?
He did it for me.
I told you to stay away from me, Viktor.
But you didn' t understand.
- I think you were confused.
- No, I confused about everything.
Not this.
I' m sorry.
I' m running late.
Why you go?
You know what Napoleon gave Josephine as a wedding present?
It was a gold locket.
And on the inside, he made an inscription.
"Destiny".
Destiny.
- Hey, baby.
I missed you.
Next.
Viktor.
Hello, Delores.
How I am today?
What do you have here?
What do you have here?
It' s not signed.
What?
This is a one- day emergency travel visa.
To validate authenticity, it needs to be signed by the supervising officer.
Dixon?
Yes.
Dixon.
I know.
Congratulations.
It' s strange, isn' t it, Viktor?
When you wait so long for one thing?
I had that moment today, too.
You see this badge?
This badge means that I was made CBP Field Commissioner.
It means that my authority over the security of this airport is absolute.
Your ticket and your passport.
It' s time for you to go home.
Officer Waylin, please show Mr Navorski into the terminal and make sure he does not miss his flight.
Goodbye, Viktor, and good luck.
I think I want go New York City.
Don' t make this difficult, Viktor.
I no more "unacceptable".
- I told you this is over.
- I go New York.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I go New York City now.
Part of my job is to get rid of undesirables, and there are quite a few.
Like this guy, Joe Mulroy.
I think you know him.
He' s been here for 20 years, but he' s been running an after- hour poker game.
Bringing in liquor and marijuana.
Poor guy' s going to lose his pension.
And I think he has kids, too.
And then there' s this guy, Enrique Cruz.
I think you also know Enrique.
Enrique has been letting people into the food preparation area.
That' s a major security breach.
The poor guy, I think he' s a newlywed.
But I' m going to have to let him go.
And then there' s Gupta Rajan.
He' s a janitor.
But he' s wanted for assaulting a police officer back in India in 1979.
I' il have to deport him.
I will go home.
What did you say?
- I will go home.
- Today.
- Yes.
If you don' t get on that plane, they' re all gone.
- Do you understand?
OK.
Good.
- You can fight these guys.
- We' il help you.
- Viktor, come on.
I owe you so much.
- Please let me help you.
- This is your friend talking.
We' re your family now.
Goodbye.
You try to fool us.
You make us to think you would walk out, that you will fight with them.
Why don' t you fight?
- The war is over.
Get lost.
Get lost.
Go home and tell them you never made it.
You come this close to America, but you don' t have the courage to go from here to here.
You are a coward.
The plane is on time.
You are a coward.
You are a coward!
What' s wrong with you, man?
Settle down.
Got people looking all around, looking at me like I' m... [sighs]
Look at me.
Come on, look at me.
There' s something you should know.
Gupta.
Gupta!
I am going home.
Get lost.
[Tannoy]
Your attention, please.
Flight 866 to Krakozhia will be delayed until further notice.
Do you have an appointment?
Somebody tell me what the hell is going on down there!
We' re right behind you.
Viktor' s leaving.
- Monica, Viktor' s leaving.
- I know.
He' s going home.
He' s going for the front door, out to the city.
What?
Remember us.
It' s good luck.
A digital camera for cousin Katia.
I don' t know where you' re going, but these will keep your feet warm.
We' re here.
Secure the door.
Sorry, Viktor.
Take him, Judge.
Hold it, Viktor.
Take it easy.
You see those doors?
To the United States of America.
Turn around.
It' s snowing in the city and you' re going to need that.
Good luck.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
I' m going to miss you.
Try not to get stuck wherever you' re going.
Arrest him!
Arrest him!
Goddammit!
Taxi!
Where you go?
161 Lexington.
It' s faster than BQE.
- Where you from?
- Krakozhia.
Viktor Navorski.
Albania.
- When do you come to New York?
- Thursday.
You want us to block the south exit and have AP sweep every vehicle?
Sir?
5. 30 from Tokyo just landed.
Barcelona on approach.
The night is young and 1500 people are headed our way.
Everybody inside.
Let' s go.
- Are you checking in, sir?
- No, no.
I want to go to this place, please.
The lobby lounge is around the corner.
They have happy hour specials and live music.
[Benny Golson]
Let' s do Killer Joe.
- Yes?
- You are Benny Golson?
Yes, I am.
Benny Golson, I am Viktor Navorski.
I am from Krakozhia.
My father, Dimitar Asenov Navorski, was great, great fan of your music.
A jazz fan.
Fantastic.
Would you sign your name, please?
Can I do it a little later?
We have to get started now.
- I will wait.
OK.
Taxi!
Taxi!
Where you want to go?
I am going home.
For as long as I can remember, the three of us have always been best friends.
Even when we were babies, me, Lonnie, and Dom shared the same crib.
We were tight, like brothers.
But we all had our own dreams.
G, let me down.
Lonnie dreamed of two things.
Mmm.
First was that Rolonda loved him as much as he loved her.
Huh?
But all she loved was his money.
He also wanted to be a big inventor.
My boy Dom.
He just loved the music.
As for me, well, I was built to be a professional athlete.
Yeah, I was gonna be the best bo xer to come out of South Philly since Rocky.
I was gonna be the Black Stallion!
Dag, this burns!
Oxygen.
$2 Tuesday was karate night.
Hyah!
Sometimes my cousin Randall would chill with us.
He had a thing for candyjacking.
I want it chilly up in here!
You now on Cha Ching' s most- wanted list.
That' s why we called him "No Good"
We went from boys to men together.
And the three of us moved into Lonnie' s Uncle Virgil' s house.
It was just temporary until we could find a better place.
You have a ride home, XiXi?
Yes, Father.
Don' t be late.
Yes, Father.
Give your father kiss.
Bye, Father.
We can go in Uncle Virgil' s room.
He got one of them orthopedic beds.
Guess who.
- Alvena?
- No.
Mm.
Hold up.
Ooh.
Rashida.
Oh, no, no.
This is Laquida.
Unh- unh- unh!
This is Tamika.
You got one more chance to get it.
Or you won' t be making it to your next fight.
Hey, baby.
I knew it was you.
I was just having fun.
Sorry I' m late.
Had to get a ride from my father.
Does your pops know you came to see me?
Yes.
Come on, baby.
You know that' s not cool.
Forget about my father.
I love you.
That' s what matters.
Hey, Lonnie!
Make a wish, Lon.
I wish Rolonda was here.
Ho- londa!
Get out the way!
- Big Swoll in the house.
- You got your wish.
Can I get her for my birthday, too?
Happy birthday, boyfriend.
Rolonda.
Don' t stop.
I was beginning to think that you weren' t gonna show.
You know Ro- Ro wouldn' t miss her Lonnie' s birthday party.
I knew you wouldn' t let me down.
This right here is my cousin Big Swoll.
He just got out the penitentiary.
Hey, Big Swoll.
It' s good to meet a member of the family.
Yeah, I' m all right, Johnny.
Happy birthday, man.
You know, Rolonda, I was thinking that...
Ooh!
Cake.
That' s what I want.
Some cake.
I haven' t eaten in two whole hours.
And for some reason, I just can' t stop eating.
Ooh.
There it is.
Nia.
You looked so busy at work today.
I' m surprised to see you here.
The studio was really busy today.
How could I miss one of your famous parties?
Yeah, and you' re wearing that top that I love so much.
That' s' cause I want you to take it off.
Just a second, baby.
Go, Daddy, go.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
That' s cute.
Oh!
Mmm!
Ooh!
I' m here now.
I' m here.
Oh.
You know, I...
I have these feelings.
I want to take care of you, Rolonda.
And I was thinking we could get our own place and maybe get married someday.
Damn, Lonnie.
That' s real sweet, baby.
Nigger ain' t never said no shit like that before.
So you think maybe we could...
Oh.
10: 30, boo.
You know what that mean.
What?
My show is on.
Up next, "Compton 90221"
My show is on, too.
We can' t be cleaning up like this.
We gotta hire ourselves a maid.
What are you complaining about?
I' m the one on my hands and knees.
I thought that was your favorite position.
Good morning, guys.
- Hey.
Hey.
What' s wrong, man?
What' s wrong, Lon?
I' m a year older, and I' m still here with you two guys at my Uncle Virgil' s house.
You know what you sound like right now, man?
Nah.
What?
A bitch.
Yeah.
Seriously, Lonnie.
You don' t want to mess around with a good thing.
I mean, take a look around you.
We got the tight bachelor pad.
We could do whatever we want.
I mean, this is it.
We made it, man.
Right there, dawg.
Mm!
Ta- dow!
You better clean this damn mess up before you leave.
I know that.
This is it?
Getting yelled at like schoolchildren?
I mean, I thought I' d be further along in my life by now.
You know, have my own family.
My own place.
One of these days you guys are gonna grow up.
You 12 minutes late.
I dock paycheck.
Look, Cha Ching, I know we got friction between us on account that I took that Kit Kat seven years ago.
And Bit- O- Honey.
Milky Way.
Black licorice.
And case of Coors.
What' s "ricorrish"?
Licorice.
Licorice!
Don' t play language game with me.
You now 14 minutes late.
Good talk.
Dang Ling, I can' t understand a damn word your daddy say.
Great first half, kids.
You missed five calls, you four- eyed punk.
Rolonda!
Peaches!
What are you doing here?
We need to talk.
I' m all ears.
Mama dear is gonna go wait over there.
Remember that time we was watching "Compton 90221" and Swapmisha had told Dante that she was pregnant?
Point is, Swapmisha wasn' t the only one got knocked up.
- You mean I' m gonna be a daddy?
- It' s yours.
Just forget it, Lonnie.
'Cause I can' t take care of no baby on my income alone.
Daddy also has a job at the Sanitation Department.
And I just got a job yesterday at Piggy Smalls' Pizzeria.
You know my Uncle Virgil raised me right, girl.
And I want to do the same for our child, Ro- Ro.
I' m gonna take care of the both of you.
You so good to me, Lonnie.
Don' t want to give me that, huh?
Come on.
Come on.
G, we need to talk.
Are you busy?
What it look like, baby?
Is everything okay?
G, I' m pregnant.
We' re going to have a baby.
Hey, Dominic.
Your next appointment is here.
Send them in.
Yo, Dommie Dom.
You gotta be kidding me.
It' s the Brothas Stylz.
- This is you?
- Oh, hell, yeah.
- Yo, you gots to put us on.
- True.
All right.
Yo, we might be wizzle.
But our lyzzles be clizzle blizzle.
You feel me, dawg?
Words.
Okay.
Go ahead and spit.
Whatever.
Someone should tell them they' re white.
Oh, hey, Nia.
What' s up?
What?
I thought I had the studio till 12: 00.
No, no.
It' s not that.
Hold up.
I...
What?
What is it?
Calm down, Dom.
You look whiter than usual.
So, Dom, she gonna have it?
Yeah.
She' s gonna have it at home.
- What kind of shit is that?
- I don' t know.
She said it' s gonna empower her as a woman or some bullshit.
My life is over.
I' m done.
Finished.
The three of us.
Daddies.
Ain' t it great?
I think we should do daddy training so we can do it right.
Yeah.
That' s it.
You know?
Do what our fathers didn' t do.
- Oh!
Ooh.
Oh, what' s that?
A little porn?
Check it out.
They got her in stirrups and everything.
Make that move, mama.
Damn!
Look at the size of that thing.
Looks like an alien.

- Ew!
Ew!
I' m Annabelle Sinclair.
And I' il be your birthing/ child- rearing expert.
And I am here to guide you through the journey that your child is gonna take from the womb to the pink or blue bedroom.
I' d like to open the floor for any pre- birthing questions.
Anybody?
Yes?
You know, is it cool to still hit the skins during pregnancy?
He asking if it' s all right to still be tappin 'that ass.
Oh, sure.
Feel free to get your swerve on throughout the pregnancy.
Damn.
Don' t be embarrassed, dear.
I ain' t.
Flatulence is very normal during pregnancy.
So let 'em rip!
[Farts]
Pregnant people, fool.
Well, hell, I had to let it go, baby.
I' m gonna hand out these balls.
And I want you to put them between your knees, okay?
Here you go.
You take this.
That' s right.
Place it right there.
Hey, Nia.
Sorry, hon.
Dominic.
This is Venus, my doula.
What' s a doula?
A midwife.
I gotta talk to you outside.
Come on.
Okeydoke.
Now we' re gonna simulate labor.
So I would like for everyone to get into their most comfortable positions.
That' s right.
Oh.
What are you doing here?
Well, you invited me here.
Look, it was my decision to have this baby.
And it was a fling, Dom.
An office fling.
Dominic, you don' t have to be here.
- [Cellphone rings]
Domineech.
Hey, Dom.
It' s Louie.
Yo.
What' s up?
Um...
Give me, like, hour and a half.
I think that you' re gonna find natural childbirth to be loving, blissful, and wonderful.
I want drugs!
Lonnie, I can' t take this pain!
Lonnie!
Is there anything else I can get you?
Horse tranquilizer, nigger!
I want drugs!
- Okay.
Hold on.
- Gin and juice!
I' m gonna get the nurse.
Nurse!
Is there a nurse?
Nurse!
Oh!
What happened, baby?
You drop some pickle juice?
It' s my water.
- Your water?
- The baby' s coming.
Oh, jeez.
Okay.
Okay, baby.
Breathe.
Cleanup, aisle 3!
Daddy!
Get Grandpa!
You have a baby here?
No!
No!
No one have baby here!
Grandpa Bling Bling doctor in China.
Grandpa?
Okay.
Okay.
Baby, breathe.
Watch out!
I' m going in.
What the hell?
Hey, man, what you doing?
What you doing?
Oh, my God!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Okay.
Let' s go.
Ro, Mama Peaches in the house, baby, with something to ease your pain.
You can' t smoke in here.
Shut your punk ass up, Urkel.
"You can' t smoke in..."
Here you go, Ro.
Mama got something for you.
Here you go, baby.
A little sip.
There you go.
You just take yourself a little sip, now.
- Relax.
- It hurts!
Breathe, baby.
Breathe.
- You did this to her.
- Huh?
- G, baby.
- Yeah, baby?
Talk to me.
Say anything.
Well, that' s what your daddy always tells me.
Nia?
Nia, I got your voice mail.
I came as soon as I could.
- Late again.
- Just breathe.
Oh, my God.
What the hell is that?
Call the doctor.
She' s crowning.
Aren' t you supposed to boil water or something?
Why don' t you stay in the kitchen with it?
I...
[Grunts]
[Grunts]
- Push it, Ro
Push it, Ro- Ro.
- Push it real good - Push it, now.
Get your ass in there and get it out, Doctor!
We' re trying to create a serene atmosphere here.
You' re not helping.
This drug- free idea is not helping, either.
- Get out of the way.
- Why don' t you go home?
[Screams]
Holy shit.
Ow!
The baby' s coming.
Baby coming!
Baby not coming.
It' s stuck.
What do you mean, stuck?
Grandma!
Stat!
- What?
- What?
- [Sobs]
Breathe, baby.
Here you are.
A little shorty.
It' s okay.
It' s got a big thing!
It' s an umbilical cord, Fat Albert.
You did great, baby.
You did great, baby.
I' m a daddy!
Yeah.
- Bruce Leroy.
- Like George Washington Carver.
- Say hello.
- I' m a daddy.
I' m a daddy!
- Jasmine.
- You should see his eyes.
She' s Jasmine, and she' s beautiful.
You are the cutest baby in all the world.
And he smell like shit.
Baby, oh.
Now would be a good time to learn how to diaper your son.
You know what?
That sounds like fun, baby.
But I gotta get to my sparring session.
I got that fight coming up.
So, you know, I gotta get ready.
You pay for juice out of paycheck!
How the hell he see me back here with this?
Don' t you remember?
I told you I was working tonight.
Uh, yeah.
You forgot, didn' t you?
Wait.
Okay.
I forgot.
I' m sorry.
All right, baby?
I can' t miss training.
Boxing is gonna be our way out of here.
I can' t work for your pops forever.
Hey, I was born to fight.
Why wait?
I kick your ass right now.
You know what?
Bring it on, Grandma.
You know, your grandmama got a big mouth.
Come shut it for me, fat- ass.
- Whoo!
Anytime, Grandma Jackie Chan.
Hey, I know how important your training is to you.
But still, I think it' s time for you to take a more active role in raising Bruce Leroy.
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.
Look at Daddy.
You' re right, boo.
It' s just that I get a little nervous when I' m with him by myself.
G, you can do this.
Thanks, guys.
Later, chump.
Hey, Tupac.
How you doing, Tupac?
Now, that is nice.
Yes.
That' s real nice.
I got watches, DVDs, candy.
What you want?
Skittles?
Cost you a dollar at the store.
I' il give you two for 50 cents.
Uh, no, thank you, Tupac.
I' m okay.
Nigger, you ain' t never got no money!
You always broke!
Hey!
I have exciting news.
You got Princess Ro- Ro' s allowance?
I enrolled us in Mommy & Me classes this weekend.
Oh, I ain' t going to that.
Mnh- mnh.
It' s gonna conflict with my strip- aerobics class.
And you know I got to lose this extra little baby fat.
'Sides, my mama ain' t never took me nor Tupac to none of them classes, and we turned out just fine.
And what' s up with all this
"you got to be with your baby" stuff lately?
What you trying to say?
I ain' t a good mama?
No.
It' s not that.
I thought it' d be nice if we spent some quality time together as a family.
Maybe we could start by having a family dinner tonight.
Mnh- mnh.
Tonight' s ladies' night at the club.
I told you I needed you to babysit.
No, you didn' t.
Look, we could go on all night with this "he say, she say, she say, he say" stuff.
But I say your ass is babysitting.
Yes, dear.
You don' t want that.
No.
It' il give you gas.
Here.
There you go.
I' m gonna help her.
I' il get her a book.
On breast- feeding.
But she gotta share with your daddy.
Oh!
- [Jasmine laughing]
I was just gonna start on some tracks.
She' s got hair.
She also breathes.
She giggles.
She' s your daughter, Dominic.
Not that anyone would ever know from your behavior.
What behavior?
Me and the Brothas Stylz are prepping for their big debut.
Get off me.
Don' t touch me.
Mm- hmm.
Hey, listen.
I' m in a pinch, and I need a big favor.
What?
I' il see you later.
Bye.
See?
It' s just you and me, kid.
Me and Jas.
All right.
All right.
Come on.
This ain' t so bad, right?
Piece of cake.
Hey, Dom, you gonna pick yours up?
I ain' t picking mine up.
You pick yours up.
You two acting like it' s the first time you' ve been alone with your kids.
- It is!
- How do we make them stop?
- Oh, come on.
Okay.
All right.
Come on.
Come on, Bruce Leroy.
Come on, big man.
It' s okay.
I think they hungry.
I' m gonna roll and get some Mickey D' s.
Formula, G.
Formula.
They drink formula.
Right, right, right.
My bad, Mr. Mom.
We got that in the fridge, right?
Yeah, yeah.
In the kitchen.
No, no.
I got it.
- One for you.
- Thank you.
One for you.
Okay.
Hey.
This ain' t my baby' s bottle.
What are you talking about?
Yo, hold up.
That' s Nia' s breast milk in that bottle.
It' s like your boy' s sucking on my lady' s titty.
Got a point there.
You' re getting soft on me, man.
G:
They like the titty on tap.
Look at Bruce Leroy.
He got an appetite like his daddy.
Look at him getting his grub on.
I think it' s time to burp 'em.
Okay.
Let' s bump 'em, then.
- Burp?
- How we do that?
You just put 'em over your shoulder.
Yeah.
Right like that.
Pat 'em on their back.
Like this?
Oh, okay.
All right.
Yeah, yeah.
- Aw, hell.
My Sean Johns!
You got the "Exorcist" baby.
Hey, that' s what babies do.
They burp.
Spit.
And shit!
Ugh!
Aw, damn.
It' s that titty milk.
I bet it is.
Look at it.
It' s green shit!
I' m a lean, mean diapering machine.
I' m a lean, mean diapering machine.
Whoo!
Whoo, that' s funky.
Dang, Bruce Leroy.
When did you eat some corn, man?
Aah!
Aah!
He peed on me!
He peed on me, Lonnie!
Oh, God!
It' s burning!
Ow!
Oh, I can' t see!
I can' t see, Lonnie!
I want my mama.
That' s all right, Bruce Leroy.
Daddy gonna get you cleaned up.
We' re just gonna get the poop out your hair.
Oh, man, you got soft hair.
You got hair like your mama.
Mm- hmm.
When you get older, all the little black girls are gonna be,
"Oh, Bruce Leroy, you got good hair.
You got Indian in your family?
And the little Chinese girls are gonna be,
"Oh, Bruce Leroy, me so horny.
Me love you long time.
'Cause everybody love Bruce Leroy.
Wa- yah!
Here' s the lotion, G.
- And the baby powder.
- Oh, okay.
See, your uncles understand a soft, sensitive bottom.
Now, who watching y' all babies, huh?
Jesus.
Thought you almost got me with that one, didn' t you?
That was a good one.
Ow.
Mnh.
Okay.
I' m throwing in the towel.
I give up.
Wait a minute.
I got an idea.
That ends the rhyming portion of the Mommy & Me class.
And now it' s time for the bonding portion of the Mommy & Me class.
We' ve got some really pretty, shiny books.
I think my daughter likes your son.
I can' t blame her.
He' s almost as cute as you are, Lonnie.
You know my name?
It' s on your tag.
I' m Brandy.
Hi.
Brandy.
Now let' s play the bragging game.
This is where we each take a turn.
And you tell us something special about your child.
Brandy, let' s start with you.
Well, Cherie has a smile that lights up the room.
Just like her mom.
Ooh.
Nice to see your domesticated ass was able to break away from the ball and chain tonight.
Fool, please.
I' m a grown- ass man.
I pay taxes.
Sometimes.
Hey, hey.
I run me.
She don' t run me.
I' m the president.
She the secretary of state.
Remember that.
Yo, yo.
Drive By' s here.
How' d you get Drive By to come up in here, man?
His rappers keep getting locked up.
He' s looking for new talent.
The Brothas Stylz are gonna be his next platinum artists.
The white boys?
Our bad.
We smashed up lizzle in this pizniece.
Can I get some?
Whatever.
- All right, then.
He' s signing that shit?
Hold up.
Hold up.
Ain' t that Ho- londa?
She' s supposed to be having dinner with Lonnie tonight.
All right.
It' s time to put some crackers up in this soup.
Comin 'straight from the street.
I mean the cul- de- sacs.
Put your hands together for the Brothas Stylz.
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
What' s up, people?
Brothas Stylz in the hizzy!
- Hit it!
Yeah!
Yeah!
That' s what I' m talkin 'about!
Yeah.
That' s what I' m talkin 'about.
All right.
All right.
I' m telling you.
These guys are the bomb.
This is the future of hip- hop right here.
You gotta trust me on this.
They got 12 tracks recorded.
They' re all hot.
Don' t sleep on this, Drive By.
I don' t usually sign white rappers.
But for y' all, I might make an exception.
Y' all come by my office.
Dismissed.
Thank you.
Get out of here!
- We' re going.
- That' s cool.
Yo, Lon, what' s wrong, man?
Man, I can' t believe Rolonda left me hanging.
I' m starting to think she' s not the woman for me.
No!
You know, it' s about time, Lon.
I got tired of you going out like a sucker.
Yeah.
Seriously, Lonnie.
You gotta get with the program like me.
I don' t think you' re getting it.
I like spending time with Carver.
It' s the mama I' m starting to doubt.
Lonnie, there are plenty of women out there that will treat you right, man.
There is this one girl, Brandy, from the Mommy & Me class.
She' s the bomb- diggity- fresh.
But I don' t think she' d go for a guy like me.
She would, man, if you took some pointers from the pros.
You know what, Lon?
You need some game, dawg.
And some new slang.
'Cause "the bomb- diggity- fresh"?
Where the hell did you get that from, anyway?
Yeah, man.
You need some style.
A makeover.
Oh.
Dawg boot camp.
Mm.
Ta- dow.
I' m listening.
Oh, no, no.
Come on.
That boy' s still ugly if you ask me.
You gotta bend your knees a little bit.
Bend your knees a little bit.
Now swing your arms.
Not like a monkey, dawg.
You gotta loosen up.
Let the tension out.
Heel, toe.
Heel, toe.
My God.
He' s white.
Hey, Brandy.
How you doin ', boo?
Lonnie.
No, no, no.
You gotta talk from your nuts, man.
More bass.
This is the art of slap boxing.
A time- honored hood tradition.
Come on, Lonnie.
Put your hands up.
Come on.
All right?
Great.
Keep 'em up.
G, man.
G.
Hey, Brandy.
How you doin ', boo?
Mm.
We created a player.
Senor Lon Juan.
Mm- hmm.
The adventures of Daddy Look Good.
So, I hear you celibate.
- What?
- Celibate.
You sellin 'a bit.
I' m buyin 'a bit.
Wow, Lonnie.
You look different all pimped out.
Daddy Look Good.
DLG!
Daddy Look Good.
Are you feeling all right?
Oh, I feel real nice.
Put your hand in my pocket and find out for yourself.
What can I get you two tonight?
Chardonnay, please.
Yac.
Colt back.
Double it up on the rocks in a dirty glass, thickness.
I' m glad you called.
You' ve been on my mind.
You been runnin 'through my mind in a thong.
What?
Thong.
It' s like string.
My bad.
My bad, baby.
My bad.
It' s looks like you gonna have to come out them clothes.
Goodbye, Lonnie.
Brandy.
Damn.
Be a good girl for Poppy, all right?
Be quiet.
Shh.
Yeah.
That' s a good girl.
Oh!
How was the date tonight?
It wasn' t that good, thanks to you two.
Didn' t you use my note cards?
Yeah, I used those.
Tried to do a little freestyling on my own.
Didn' t really work.
Hey, man.
Hey, hey.
That was all Ass- anova right there.
You know, I really like this girl Brandy.
Little Carver really likes her.
Look, man, maybe y' all can patch this up somehow.
Man, the way I acted tonight, G,
I' il be lucky if that woman ever talks to me again.
You didn' t take your hat off, did you?
Like a damn fool.
- [Grunts]
What' s all the racket down here, huh?
Babies screaming and everything.
I' m trying to go to the bathroom.
- I can' t do nothing.
- You okay, Jas?
You inconvenient son of a bitch.
Keep the damn noise down before I break my foot off in your ass, boy.
He' s mad 'cause he got hemorrhoids.
Oh!
Hey.
- What are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.
What' s going on?
- Hey.
- What?
Daddy has planned a big family dinner on Saturday.
- Uh- huh.
- And he' s invited you.
He' s gonna have me as the main course or something?
I can' t this Saturday.
Why?
No Good' s getting released from prison on Saturday.
No Good is nothing but trouble.
And we have a son.
Come on.
Things are different now.
Baby, things are different for him, too.
He' s a reformed man now.
For real.
G, the two of you together spells trouble.
All I know is that he' s my cousin and he deserves a second chance.
Six ounces, just like Mama said.
Uh- huh.
Test it.
Ahh.
There you go.
Come on.
Bruce Leroy, that' s good milk, man.
Damn, that' s some good titty milk.
No!
Yo, who the hell...
No Good?
That' s right, baby.
I' m back on the bricks.
What the hell you comin 'through the window for?
Oh, creature of habit, dawg.
Just trying to keep my skills sharp, man.
No Good' s back!
Show your cousin some love, baby.
You got it, baby.
Dawg, I can' t believe it' s been two years since you been locked down.
Well, had the jurisprudence not violated the statute of limitations per se,
I would have only done 30 days, bro.
Did you get a law degree in prison?
Nah.
I watched "The Practice" for two seasons.
I' m representing myself next time.
Oh, next time, huh?
You always had game, player.
You always had game.
Speaking of game, man, what' s up with you?
You still boxing?
Yeah, but it' s sort of been put on the back burner for now.
Oh, really?
How come?
Remember we used to go candyjacking back in the day?
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Let' s just say that a hot temper runs in his family.
Really?
How you know that?
Um...
Well, his daughter had my baby.
Oh, shit!
Hey, hey, dawg, watch your F- ing language in front of my son, dawg.
- Wow.
- Hey, hey.
Bruce Leroy, it' s your cousin No Good, man.
What' s up, little bro?
Yep.
Gimme a little bit.
Just a slap.
- Go on.
Hit it.
- Hit it, now.
Hey.
That' s my little man.
Drive By, my man, your label is the first one I thought of when I discovered the Brothas Stylz.
Check it out.
Some people think that, like, we kinda like a white OutKast.
If I want to know what people think of you, I' il tell you.
- Very good, sir.
You remind people of a white OutKast.
Yeah.
You really got your finger on the pulse, there, Drive By.
You weren' t thinking about going to another label?
Well, actually, you know...
You were always the first choice.
- Right here.
- Right here, dawg.
Here' s the contracts.
Sign 'em.
Wait, wait, wait.
This is it?
I mean, this is legally binding?
This is it.
Wanna talk royalties?
Cool.
Publishing.
That' s all right.
If you even want a handicapped parking permit, get at me.
mess with me!
I have an anger- management issue.
You understand?
Yeah, yeah.
We gonna sign that up right here.
Good.
That calls for a celebration.
Oh, we gonna pop up some of that bubbly?
No, fool.
Milk and cookies.
- Milk and cookies?
You got a problem with my milk and cookies?
- No.
- No, no.
Pleasant surprise.
Change of pace.
Well, dip, fool.
Dip!
All right.
We dipping.
- I can' t get it in, dawg!
- Break it off!
Break it off, man!
Break it off!
You better dip and eat them cookies.
Insult me, and I' il beat your ass.
Today we' re gonna discuss something every parent must go through.
It' s potty training.
Don' t make those faces.
It' s not as hard as you think.
We' re gonna do some role- playing today.
Show you how to get your baby' s bottom onto the actual ring.
You might want to sing it a song to relax the muscles.
Make some funny faces.
Now, it' s also very important to praise your child' s movement.
"Look at that.
Look what Jason left behind.
Look at the big brown goldfish.
[Clapping]
Daddy, everyone, this is G' s cousin No Good.
G, why don' t you introduce No Good to my family?
No Good, this is XiXi' s father, Cha Ching.
Oh, sure.
What' s up, nigga?
Yeah.
No Good.
And this is Grandma Fung- Yu.
Hi- yo.

"The shit" is good?

"The shit" is real good, Sing Sing.
I ain' t have to worry about getting shanked at chow.
Don' t be so sure.
What' s up with your dawg?
Damn, Grandma!
That was a wet one.
- What?
- I have cable.
Whatever, little man.
On cable, every man in prison movie tosses...
Dang Ling.
That' s enough.
Now, go wash the dishes.
When you' re done, you finish tarring the roof.
My father wants to tell you something.
G, I want to offer you a manager position at the market.
Yes.
You know, Cha Ching, I really appreciate that.
But that' s not what I want to do.
Ooh, shit.
Being a manager is a great job.
Look, I got a job.
Boxing is not a job.
You always say that.
But I got my shot coming up, all right?
I thought you would be happy.
With this promotion, we could finally get our own place.
Yo.
That would be dope.
The three of us.
Hey, brother.
Hey.
I' m talking about the future.
Whether it' s brighter to hang around the gym and chilling with a bad influence like...
Like what?
Huh?
Like what?
Look, I' m not gonna give up boxing, okay?
And I would appreciate it if you wouldn' t give up on me, either.
I' m gonna help Dang Ling clean these dishes.
Somebody done messed up, huh?
This is for XiXi.
Okay.
Ow!
Oh, shit!
Jab!
I' m gonna do it for my baby.
I' m gonna do it for Bruce Leroy.
I' m gonna die!
This duck cheesesteak is great.
It' s the other brown meat.
You better ask somebody.
You hear that, sucker?
G!
Back away from the duck!
Get him, Dang Ling!

Go see Daddy.
Go see Daddy.
You' re gonna see Daddy.
Okay.
There you go, honey.
You gonna see Daddy today?
- Hey, Dominic.
I wasn' t talking to you.
I was talking to Jas.
She just ate, so she should be ready for bed soon.
What, are you paintin 'the town with your friend Pluto?
Somethin 'like that.
What about you?
Beer delivery.
You' re not having a party tonight, are you?
No, no, no, no.
Okay.

We' re gonna be okay.

Doesn' t it say right here?
I don' t think we should leave.
We' re goin 'downstairs, man.

Bye- bye.
Sleep tight, little fella.
Ooh, brother gotta pee.
Oh!
Anybody ever tell you you have beautiful hair?
Come on, let' s get busy.
No, no, Stacy.
Don' t go in there.
We' il go in there.
Come on, Dom.
You did not bring me up here to play with my hair.
It' s foreplay, baby.
Ha ha!
Hey.
Hey!
I' m gonna go check on the kids.

What?
- How?
- Bruce Leroy.
What?
Who put y' all up here?
- Carver, you know how to walk?
- Jasmine.
It' s all my fault.
I should have checked to make sure the door was closed.
It could have been worse.
A lot worse.
Man, these kids depend on us.
This is our chance to be fathers, man.
And we can do the right thing right now.
Y' all in or what?
Yeah.
I' m in.
Yeah, we can do this.
Look, fellas, I wouldn' t believe it if I hadn' t seen it with my own former four eyes.
Two proud papas.
Daddies, even.
Fathers.
Hangin 'out with their kids.
That' s right.

I thought you said we was chillin 'today, man.
We are.
At the store?
Look here, man.
Stop complaining, all right?
XiXi gonna get on my ass if I don' t start pulling my weight, all right?
You need a wheelbarrow to haul all that in.
Oh, snap!
See, this is what I' m talking about right here.
This is what I wish I could get for my son.
Why don' t you buy it?
Man, do you know how expensive it is to raise a child now?
There' s diapers.
There' s formula.
- Not to mention the toys.
- Wow.
Hell, man, I barely got enough for the necessities.
I' m gonna get that, though.
Yeah, I' m gonna get that.
Right.
Diapers.
Bottles.
Chips.
Cool.
Damn!
Look, I left my wallet in the car.
Hold this spot.
Don' t lose it.
- All right.
Excuse me, ma' am.
Oh, hey, how you doin '?
You look just like Patti LaBelle.
Without the big hair, though.
When she was with the LaBelles.
Yeah, okay.
All right, now!
Freeze!
I want it chilly up in here!
Sir?
We don' t have much money in the till.
You' re welcome to it.
But I would recommend that you rob a convenience store.
Did I ask you for money?
No, I did not.
Now, give me some of them snot suckers.
Some of them rattles.
Some ass thermometers.
Yeah.
Y' all got some baby grub up in here?
Is the baby teething?
Oh, and don' t forget the rubber nipples.
Yeah.
And the booties for the baby' s feet.
And cotton swabs.
Cotton swabs.
Is the baby still on formula?
You should really start going for organic.
Organic.
Right, right, right, right.
What the hell "organic" mean?
It means it' s grown naturally without any harmful pesticides that might poison your baby.
What?
You trying to poison my kid?
No!
I want everything organic up in this bitch!
Right now!
I don' t want nobody to move for two minutes.
That' s 150 seconds.
That didn' t sound right.
Hoo- hoo!
Open the trunk.
Man, don' t tell me you just robbed the store!
Open the trunk, dawg.
What the hell did you do, fool?
They was robbin 'us.
Just 'cause it' s overpriced don' t mean you steal it.
Why you trippin '?
I did this for you, dawg.
What?
You the one got a baby to handle.
Oh, I' m trippin '?
'Cause I ain' t your accomplice no more?
What?
You got a baby now so you don' t work no more?
Oh, so robbin 'is work now?
Yeah.
Man, they runnin 'my plates.
Get in the car, man!
You like hanging out with your Uncle No Good.
Take some of those right there.
That' s what' s up.
Yeah, this is kind of good.
Mmm, I can see how you eat this stuff right here, brother.
You know what?
Me and your daddy got you all kinds of good stuff today.
Got it for free, too, if you know what I' m sayin '.
With a toy gun.
Made a clean getaway.
You know why?
You know why?
'Cause crime does pay.
Yes, it does.
Hey, baby.
What?
What' s up, dawg?
Baby, what' s the problem?
You mad?
Are you stupid?
What are you talking about?
Robbing baby stores?
Baby, that was No Good.
Tell that to your son when your dumb ass ends up in jail!
Baby, I told you...
"Baby!"
- NO GOOD:
- Shit!
God.
Yeah.
It' il be okay.
Okay?
G, just look at it as a chance to grow.
To get in touch with yourself.
Look, man, I' m tired of touching myself.
I want my lady to touch me.
I want XiXi to touch me.
Where you goin ', sexy?
Big meeting today, fellas.
Gonna have a huge payday.
And maybe who knows, you know?
Get a place of my own.
Jas could have a backyard.
Her own room.
Man, you know what you sound like?
What?
A bitch?
No.
A man.
All right.
I' il talk to you later.
You kind of dress like a bitch, though.
Drive By, you so crazy.
So, when did you guys become such good friends?
This is gonna be hard.
This is gonna be real hard.
It' s gonna be hard for the Stylz Brothas to say...
You ain' t gonna be the Brothas Stylz' s manager no more.
That wasn' t that hard.
No, no, no.
Very easy, dawg.
Let' s go.
You' re dismissed, bitch.
Dismizzle, bizzle.
I' m all right!
- Dang Ling, where' s XiXi?
- She don' t want to see your ass.
Cha Ching, where' s XiXi?
G, we need to talk.
Outside.
You get that black eye boxing?
Nope.
From your daughter.
Yeah, she got a left hook like her mother.
I don' t smoke cigarettes.
Take a closer look, fool.
Special smoke.
Cure a chronic ailment.
Even a broken heart.
Hmm.
Damn, man.
All this time, I thought you was uptight and shit.
You remind me of myself when I was your age.
The Triads.
I was the leader of the Far East Side Riders.
I dreamt of being the Chinese Scarface.
Hey.
Say hello to my little friend.
Hey.
What happened?
Met XiXi' s moms up at the club.
Got gander at junk in the trunk.
She made you turn your life around.
Not before reality bitch- slapped me in the face first.
Gangster Gung Ho got cap busted in ass.
Pour a little out for homies ain' t here.
Yeah.
After that, all I could think about was giving my daughter and my baby' s mama a better life.
Any regrets?
One.
I didn' t do it sooner.
Dominic.
Hi.
I wasn' t expecting you.
- Yeah, I know.
I just wanted to see if we could talk maybe.
Well, this really isn' t the best...
Dominic.
What' s she doing here?
You caught us at a bad time.
We just got out of the bath.
"We"?
Maybe we should talk.
Are you trying to tell me you' re a...
Let' s be real.
Jasmine needs a full- time parent.
For when she' s sick.
For when she can' t sleep.
You know you can' t be counted on for that.
No, that' s not true.
That' s what I wanted to talk to you about.
We have to do what' s best for Jasmine.
And you think her having two mommies is what' s best?
Yes.
Venus and I are in love.
She' s with Jasmine every single day.
You' re more into the Stylz Brothas than you are into being a dad.
Brandy.
Brandy.
I know you' re mad at me.
Hell, if I was you, I' d be mad at me, too.
But if you give me a chance to explain.
I am sorry.
Brandy.
Carver.
I am sorry.
Wake your sorry asses up!
I ain' t gonna say this but one time.
So you damn well better hear me.
Now, Lonnie.
Don' t get caught up in this "baby' s mama" drama.
Now, you had you a good woman in Brandy.
She a good woman.
She likes you.
And that baby likes you, too.
You need to be a man.
You need to go ahead and pick your hair out and get rid of them damn deep- sea- diving goggles and handle your business.
And you.
Rerun.
Huh?
Yeah, you.
You got a good woman, too.
But you' re too damn lazy.
All you want to do is lay up on your ass all day.
And you ain' t no fighter.
Hell, I' il knock your dick in the dirt, old as I am.
Yeah, you need to put your family first.
Put your family first.
And, Dom, you ain' t no player.
Now, Uncle VirgiI was a player.
You hear me?
I was slammin 'more Cadillac doors and pimpin' more ho' s while you were still swimming around in your daddy' s nut sac.
And you got a good woman, too.
But no, you mad 'cause she done got herself another woman.
Hell, be Uncle Virgil back in the day,
I' d have both them chicks over at my house right now.
Cookin 'my breakfast.
Butt- naked.
With the house shoes on.
Best thing I can suggest to you is you get yourself back in your baby' s life as soon as you can.
Don' t be like me, Dom.
End up old.
Lonely.
Living with your goofy- ass nephew and his broke- ass friends.
Do I really look like Rerun?
Brandy!
Slow down, kids.
Brandy!
Brandy, can you find it in your heart to forgive me?
You know, the loving, the caring, the compassionate, the dashing, the debonair, the real Lonnie.
He' s back.
And he' d like another chance.
How about dinner tonight?
I' m all ears.
You want some pig feet?
Ooh, is she a cutie pie.
Like her mama.
Yes, indeedy, feed the needy.
Want some ribs?
Some chitlins?
So, we were high school sweethearts.
I thought he was Prince Charming.
But he turned out to be a toad.
Your ex and my baby' s mama need to get together.
'Cause she' s a rat.
A hood rat.
Right.
You know, I' ve always had this idealistic view of family.
House in the burbs.
With the white picket fence.
And a cute puppy, like a...
Chocolate lab.
Oh.
Let me clean those for you.
Hey, are these new glasses?
Yeah, the other ones are kind of large and square.
What you waitin 'on, dawg?
An engraved invitation?
Huh?
Kiss her, fool.
Go, Lonnie.
Go.
Go, Lonnie.
Yeah.
I know Ho- landa' s my mama.
But Brandy' s all that and a bag of tits.
He' s right, boy.
I mean, check out those tig old bitties.
I' ve been sucklin 'those chocolate- milk sacs for months, and it is nice.
Lonnie.
Are you feeling okay?
No, I think I had a little too much wine.
I guess it is getting a bit late.
Yeah, maybe I should be going.
That' s my daddy.
What the hell is...
Open up the door, fool.
What the hell is this, man?
Breakfast, fool.
No, man, I' m talking about what the hell you do to the room.
My grandmother told me make myself at home, man.
Want a grilled- cheese sandwich, man?
No, I' m cool.
All right, then.
You still mad at me, man?
Look, Robin Hood.
Because of what you did, XiXi ain' t speakin 'to me.
I haven' t even seen my baby, man.
That little stunt you pulled really messed my life up.
What' s up with you, man?
You still the same guy that got "Thug Life" tatted on his arm?
Yeah, that' s me.
But I got my son' s name tatted on the other arm now.
We gonna always be boys, man.
We family.
I got a family of my own now.
So that' s my priority.
I feel you, dawg.
I' m proud of you, man.
Thanks, baby.
Now, you sure you don' t want one of these grilled cheese?
Yeah, go on and hook me up one, man.
All right, then.
It' s organic.
What the hell you doin 'bustin' in here like you pay the bills?
I mean, like you' re the police.
Sit your Count Crackula- lookin 'ass down.
- What?
- And you shut the hell up.
Show me some respect around here.
'Cause Lord knows I earned it.
The days of you two bitches using my baby boy for a payday are over.
He' s coming with me.
I might let you see him.
But Princess Ro- Ro...
But Ro- Ho, my ass.
Be- otch!
You don' t like the way I roll, take me to court.
Come on, little Carver.
Let' s go home.
Sorry you had to hear that, man.
Oh, don' t worry.
You' il still get your little $300 a week.
Ain' t that what you had him for?
Let' s get out of here.
Mama, no.
And I' m proud to say that many of Philadelphia' s top artists have recorded right here in this studio.
And we have an award- winning engineering...
Dominic.
What are you doing here?
I just want to tell you you' re right.
Being a parent means being there every day.
Look, I know you don' t need me, Nia.
But I need Jasmine.
Things haven' t exactly been going my way lately.
First the Brothas Stylz fire me.
Then I find out you' re a lesbian.
Wait a minute.
You got fired?
You' re a lesbian?
Thank you.
Thanks.
The other day, I went to visit you, right?
I saw you and Venus with Jasmine.
You guys looked just like a family, you know.
And it became clear what' s important.
I need to be part of my daughter' s life.
I want to pack her lunch on the first day of kindergarten.
I want to put Bactine on her skinned knee when she falls off her bike.
I want to keep her away from players like me.
I know it sounds stupid.
But there' s more to life than chasing girls.
That' s raising one.
Come here.
Let Daddy strap you in.
Swoll, leave him alone.
You can' t bust up in here, take Ro' s baby, and break out, Donnie!
What you want to do, little man?
Huh?
What you want?
It' s Lonnie!
Lonnie, partner.
Can I roll with you?
Not this time, Little Tupac.
Superboy that became Superman.
Ro, you shouldn' t have never let that man slip through your fingertips.
Hey.
Baby, I' m sorry.
I' m sorry it took me so long to figure out
I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you and Bruce Leroy.
I don' t want Bruce Leroy growing up not knowing who his father was like I did.
I want him to be proud to call me "Dad."
And I want you to be proud to call me your husband.
XiXi.
G, you had me at "hello."
My man Lonnie finally found happiness.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may now kiss the bride.
Look at that.
You got spit on her chin.
Whoa.
Save something for the hotel room, there.
Your kids gonna watch this.
Honeymoon time.
Honeymoon time.
Lon, the Carver 5000 is da bomb, man.
Thank you, Uncle Virgil.
And Brandy inspired him to achieve his dream of becoming the most successful black inventor since the sister who invented the hot comb.
Toys" R" Us just ordered 1, 000 units of the Carver 5000.
Whatever happened to the Stylz Brothas?
Yeah, yeah.
The white boys.
Kind of had a problem at the Apollo.
What' s up, my niggas?
- Bad management.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dom stopped being a player and started being a father.
Inspired by his baby girl, Jas, he decided to spin his music career in a different direction.
He created Hip- Hopscotch Records, and the first act he signed was Little Tupac.
A. K. A. Mini T.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
No Good finally found his niche.
And it' s organic.
No pesticides or nothing.
All right.
He got himself his own cooking show and became known as the "O. G."
The Organic Gangster.
A smidgen of cayenne pepper.
- Then boom!
Pow!
Ta- dow!
The flavor is major in this piece.
Now, meat tenderizing.
First...
- You get your meat.
- Oh, yeah.
Then you get your tenderizer.
Gonna beat that meat.
Fist, meet meat.
Meat, meet fist.
And you start tenderizing, brother.
Where my money at?
You been owing me $5 for, like, two weeks now.
So, Mrs. XiXi Ling Yoon Dung Quon Puck Washington.
Yes?
You' il be happy to know that I' m hanging up my gloves, boo.
Really?
You' re giving up boxing?
Well, not completely.
Me and my father- in- law, Cha Ching, opened us up our very own bo xing gym/ karate studio.
We call it the Mofo Dojo.
Hit me hard!
Hit me!
Good.
Come on.
Come on!
Come on!
Harder!
You hit like a girl!
Other hand!
Get back over there.
Come on!
Come on!
Class dismissed.
To great friends.
Nah.
To great...
babies' daddies.
Three little babies turning us into three grown men.
Come on.
Get up.
Come on.
Out of the way!
Hold it!
Don' t move!
Don' t move!
Get away from that window!
Get over there!
Do what I say!
Oh, shit.
Pick up my meat.
- You hungry, brother?
- Do I look hungry?
Get over there!
I might be a little hungry, but get your hands up!
- He ain' t got no gun.
- You think I ain' t got a gun?
- Shoot me, goddamn it!
- I' il shoot you.
You mother...
No.
Come on, Hank!
Back up, back up!
What you know about a brother needing a job?
- Big Floyd Patterson haircut head.
- You don' t look like Floyd.
I just wanted to barbecue.
It' s the goddamn Fourth of July.
Can' t a black man have a goddamn Fourth of July, too?
- Open up!
It' s the police!
- Sweet Jesus.
Kick it in!
- Don' t mess with my conk.
- You want a barbecue?
Is there a problem, officers?
Yeah.
We' re looking for a thief.
You seen one?
Me?
No, I haven' t seen a thi...
Hank, you seen a thief around here?
- No, no, not around here.
- No, me, either.
No thief.
You guys aren' t celebrating the holiday?
Sure.
We' re just finishing up our last customer.
I said play like you cuttin 'it.
Eddie, you can' t talk about people just 'cause they biracial.
- Why not?
- 'Cause that' s silly.
They can take it like anybody else.
All I' m saying, Calvin, is black folk love to take credit for they half- black brothers and sisters till somethin 'goes sour.
You know, like Tiger Woods... we claim him.
{Y: i} Jennifer Beals.
What the boy mama used to be on The Jeffersons?
- Lenny Kravitz.
- Lenny Kravitz... count him.
As soon as they go freak out just a little bit, go a little crazy, get a little glitter like Mariah Carey, then all of a sudden it' s the other half that went looney tunes.
- What about Vin Diesel?
- I don' t know what he is.
Half car.
What black man do you take credit for?
{Y: i} I' il tell you who I don' t want to take credit for... that D. C. Sniper.
I was mad when I found out dude was black.
Hold on there, Terri.
The D. C. Sniper is like the Jackie Robinson of crime.
What?!
Tell them, Eddie.
He broke into the white leagues with that crime.
That crime took planning.
Not only planning, it took math.
You know, it took math to figure out all them trajectories to shoot from the back of an automobile.
That' s white- folk shit right there.
With the problems we got, black folks used to could say,
"At least we ain' t crazy."
Our crimes made sense.
Ain' t got no money, rob somebody with money.
Black folks are just as crazy as white folks.
Mike Tyson... he' s like three crazy people.
Prince?
Hold on, hold on now.
He half Cherokee or something.
Don' t put him in with us.
DVDs, CDs.
Ike Turner' s greatest hits with Tina on the cover.
Got something you ain' t gonna believe...
R. Kelly on tape with grown women.
{Y: i} I got Grandmas Gone Wild.
You ever seen wrinkles in a thong?
Fred, don' t buy nothing from that fool.
{Y: i} That Nemo tape I got for my son has a crack deal on it.
- Why you always lyin 'on me?
- Ain' t nobody lyin 'on you.
Line me up.
I got a meeting in 19 minutes.
Head to your meeting 'cause I got next.
K - Rod called and booked the spot after that, but I can get you at 3: 45 or 11: 00 on Tuesday.
You a superstar now?
The Eminem of the barber world?
Yeah, that' s why they call me Slim Fadin '.
This used to be my chair.
Wasn' t but two seconds ago your pasty Pilgrim ass was sitting at that front seat and nobody was feeling you.
Well, they' re feeling me now.
I' il touch you up.
My customer' s running late, so I can take you.
Cool.
Hi.
Hello.
So... what' s it like working for Alderman Brown?
It' s good.
The alderman is a great mentor.
Must be nice doing what you said you' d always do.
I really admire that.
- Apple juice?
- What' s going on here?
Who set this up?
This shit ain' t funny.
- What?
- This.
You being nice to me?
You admire me?
You got back together with Kevin, didn' t you?
I do not need a man to make me feel good.
Plus, I' m trying to be at peace with myself.
I don' t know this woman.
Would you know me if I shoved my foot up your ass?
Oh, yes, there she goes.
Let' s go.
Lookin 'good, Mr. Stewart.
Now you can get your swerve on.
Calvin, when you get my age, you don' t swerve.
You just be happy gettin 'that bad boy out of park.
You got something smaller?
I don' t got change.
- Just keep it.
- You ain' t got to tell me twice.
What' d you do, hit the lotto?
- I sold the cleaners.
- What?
Yep, sold it.
Time for early retirement.
Quality Land Development came in and made me an offer.
More money than I' d ever seen.
I jumped at it.
- What are they going to put in?
- A Kinko' s or something.
I heard they was gonna move a Subway over there.
A Subway and a Blockbuster.
Yep.
White folk is coming back.
They tryin 'to make money on a brother.
This ain' t about white folks comin 'back.
Most of these businesses coming in are black- owned.
This whole block is gonna get upgrades.
They can tear down all this mess around here.
Change is a good thing.
Long as they ain' t buildin 'liquor stores and titty bars, I' m cool with it.
Wait a minute now, Calvin.
If they build a titty bar across the street, I ain' t never goin 'home.
Hey, babe!
Here' s your shit.
I burned the rest of it.
The next time you want to call yourself sleeping around behind somebody' s back, make sure she look like something
Your cell called the house, and I heard all two minutes of it.
No, I didn' t hear it?
Are you trying to call me a liar?
I don' t even see how you could cheat on me with your toddler penis.
I hope you had a good time.
The next time you come back, I' m gonna get medieval on your ass.
I got a sword, I got an ax, a box of bullets, and I' m gonna get both of my babies' daddies to jump on that ass!
What does she gotta have both of them for?
Shut up!
I ain' t never goin 'home.
You couldn' t go home if you wanted to.
You act like you know what you' re doing.
Please, man.
Now watch this.
Balance.
No.
Balance.
Balance.
What is all that Circus Dee Soleil that you' re doin '?
All that flippity hippity stompity stoobily- doo.
It ain' t necessary to cut nobody head.
What' s up, dawg?
I don' t get the "I"?
Come on, dawg.
You know I gotta have the "I."
Stop playin '.
- Where do you want it?
- Right here.
Tight!
That mess ain' t right.
I want my rent money on the first.
Not the second, not...
Hold on, let me finish my thought.
Not the second, 'cause I' m not the bad guy here.
Am I the bad guy here?
Come here.
Check it out, little man.
One thing you' re gonna constantly have to deal with in your life, and that' s broke- ass black folks.
They gonna be hard to spot 'cause they dressed real nice.
Don' t let that fool you, 'cause the nicer they dress, usually the broker they are.
I like hanging with you.
You know, this is gonna be yours one day... all of this.
Hey, Calvin, you goin 'over to Emma' s?
Tell her my niece sent her a graduation picture Friday.
- Bring me back a sweet potato pie.
- I ain' t bringing you back nothin '.
Hey, Keisha.
Where Janelle at?
Hey, boo.
Now, why you even go there?
You can read a calendar.
You know she called in sick.
I need my rent money.
The bank want they money on the first.
I need my money on the first, not the second and not the 15th.
Come here, Coley.
Come here.
Your mommy leave you with this crazy man?
Crazy?
I' m about to drop him off at Miss Emma' s.
Ain' t that right?
You know, your daddy used to like to play with those, too.
- And this.
- Watch your mouth, girl.
I mean stuff.
- Y' all see Calvin baby boy?
- Hey, Coley.
You know that should have been your baby.
I know.
After Calvin and I stopped dating, he started thinkin 'small.
He opted for the Happy Meal instead of the Super Size.
No, he opted for less drama.
- It' s her six- foot Pocahontas weave.
- That' s what it is.
She ain' t weavin 'it up like most of y' all in here.
Y' all just mad 'cause she got a little Indian in her family.
Please.
That girl got perm in her family.
Why every time I come in here, you start up with me?
You know I got love for you.
If you got that much love for me, tell Janelle to give me my rent before I turn off the power in here and have all you ladies runnin 'out screaming.
Bye, Gina.
How come you not playing with Coley?
You' re just my baby.
Yes, he is.
Stop.
Say grace first.
Jesus wept.
Why?
Why what?
Why did Jesus weep?
- 'Cause he was sad.
- Why was he sad?
'Cause they didn' t let him eat his biscuit.
Now, you know I helped raise you better than that.
Raised you like you was my own son.
Okay.
I gotta go, Miss Emma.
When you get back here, you better tell me why Jesus wept.
You know what?
'cause they wouldn' t let him put jelly on his biscuit before he left.
I ain' t seen you in two days.
And why you look so damn tired?
Ricky, just be a man and let me know.
I' m being a man.
If you got somebody else, then just say it.
You don' t need to be slippin 'and slidin' and hidin '.
Nobody hidin '.
This ain' t no subterfuge.
- I just been busy.
- Doin 'what?
'Cause you sure ain' t doin' me.
Who you doin '?
And what the hell is a subter- fudge?
Listen, you know how it is, all right?
When we together, we together.
And when we not, we not.
That Ricky, he' s the man.
Please.
He' s a clown.
Be like Mike, not like Rick.
If I was like Mike, would you like me?
- Brad Pitt.
- Mel Gibson.
- Bill Clinton.
- Bill Clinton?
He' s a freak, and I likes me a freaky man.
If I had to choose me a white boy to sleep with,
- I' d have to say Mini- Me.
- Mini- Me?
Use your head.
- What?
- What?
Use your head.
You bad girl!
Excuse me, Miss Watson.
I' m sorry.
Hey, Dinka.
- Good morning.
- What' s up, D?
Thank you, Dinka.
They look great.
- Beautiful shoes.
- Thank you, Dinka.
Damn a Mini- Me.
I' il take me one of those.
All I' m saying is we need to keep our eye on Trent Lott.
We need to know where his ass is at all times.
He racist!
He' s the poster child for stupid white men.
I don' t know about that.
Dan Quayle couldn' t spell "potato."
You know what?
You right about that, Checkers.
You know what?
You can be a stupid white man and get elected president.
Twice!
All I' m saying is if you' re gonna have oral relations with an ugly, fat white girl with low self- esteem, lock the door.
Lock the door!
Click.
Handle your business.
Calvin, come look.
They' re gonna lock your ass up for talkin 'like that.
When did they put that up?
Guess it ain' t no titty bar.
Hold up.
I can' t believe this.
- Quentin!
- Hey, Calvin.
You like our sign?
Not too flashy, I hope.
I don' t want it to fight the funk of the neighborhood.
I thought this was a club.
What is Nappy Cutz?
You never heard of us?
It' s a franchise, the black man' s answer to Supercuts.
Got ten locations nationwide.
This' il be the first one in Chicago.
Ten chairs with every amenity the African- American male desires.
- On my block?
- It' s just an alternative.
You the man.
Your shop is legendary.
Only business on the block to survive the riots of '68.
We can' t compete with you.
I gotta go.
Listen, when 24/ 7 opens, I' d love to buy you a latte.
I can buy my own damn latte.
I know what this is.
You' re tryin 'to compete with us.
It' s not a competition.
It' s a rout.
Your business will be closed in six months, seven at the most.
like a Bally' s or a Jamba Juice.
We could bypass all the stress if you would sell it to me now.
But of course you wouldn' t do that... too much pride.
And I respect that.
I respect that, too.
You be safe out there.
I was gonna say the same thing to you.
What did slick- head negro want?
These guys fittin 'to open a shop on our block?
They' re gonna take all our customers.
Quality Land Development buyin 'up everything.
We just gotta step up our game.
Hey, Rick, you handled that deposit for me?
You gonna have to cool it on these extra activities.
I don' t care about your vampire hours as long as you do what I ask.
It' s not what you think.
- I had some...
- Some bullshit to do.
You should' ve asked me, someone more dependable.
Both of you can kiss my ass.
Hold up, don' t fall apart.
Don' t fall apart.
Not right now, okay?
We got competition on the block.
And I guess change, that' s a good thing, right?
Well, it' s free enterprise.
This is America.
Shut up, Dinka.
- Survival of the fittest.
- Says the privileged white boy.
The privileged white boy do a better job on that fade.
You' re starting to cross the line.
Relax yourself.
Quit it.
Quit it.
Don' t sweat it, Cal.
We got your back no matter what.
Come on, everybody, let' s go back.
This ain' t nothin '.
I' ve seen this many times.
They come and they go.
We gonna be all right.
We gonna be fine.
- Man, why you trippin 'back there?
- Why you frontin ', man?
I know you' re supposed to be the superstar, but don' t you ever roll up on my customers.
- What was you thinkin '?
- You' re right, man.
Okay, it' s my bad.
It' s my bad.
His fade was a little crooked, though.
It' s hard being that good, ain' t it?
Com.
{Y: i} It' s the professionalism that is bestowed upon me
{Y: i} when I come into Nappy Cutz that I appreciate.
Did that boy say "bestowed upon me"?
That' s what it sounded like.
{Y: i} It' s the bikini waxes that I love...
Look at the couches, man, and the lighting.
Look at that.
{Y: i} Last week I had me a milk bath.
What?
They dippin 'sisters in milk over there?
Give me some cookies.
I' il go over there myself.
Was that...
- That was him!
- It looked like him.
That' s a look- alike.
How can they get him?
Turn that mess off.
That little girl is nasty!
Back to work.
Checker Fred, back to checkers.
My boys up in Memphis go to Nappy Cut.
They said it' s off the chain.
They got honeys in bikinis, be serving wine when they walk through the door.
That ain' t nothin '.
I heard they got fish in the floor, swimming.
You standin 'on top of them.
- Fondued?
I like that whole massage thing.
That' s tight.
Let me tell you all somethin '.
That' s not a real barbershop.
That' s a fake, franchise, corporate version of a barbershop.
That' s why they got gimmicks.
They ain' t got no real character up in there.
A real barbershop got real people, real conversation, and most of all, real barbers, and that' s what we got here.
Calvin, my man!
Oh, God.
Kenard.
Hold up.
Dude, look...
I love you, cuz.
I love you, man.
I finished barber school on Wednesday, and now I' m working in a shop today.
That' s how family supposed to do for each other.
- Did Jennifer call you?
- I spoke to her this morning.
Did she tell you that maybe I' il try you out?
Maybe?
I' m down with trying out.
I' m about to be Rookie of the Year up in here.
That' s me, man?
Baby, you' re putting me in the front chair?
The best chair in the shop.
That' s how family supposed to do.
You right, too much love.
What' s up, player?
How you feelin '?
All right.
Freddie Douglass!
You old school!
Come on.
You can do it.
Come on, now.
All right!
What' s up, girlfriend?
Okay, okay.
What' s up, brother?
Everything cool?
Don' t leave me hanging.
Mutombo!
What' d you shave your head for?
I' m with you, brother.
We goin 'back to Africa.
Beauties.
Hello.
Mia!
Naomi!
You know you know me.
I know you not gonna let him put them pictures up, not when you made me take Lola Falana down.
Kenard.
It' s a probationary period.
You understand probation, don' t you?
Who is this orphan?
All right, all right.
Rich, where you at, man?
Ain' t never seen nothin 'like that in your life.
Yeah, that' s good.
Tighten myself up.
Yo, Big C, explain him.
Call my wife, man.
That' s her people.
Damn.
Come on.
Have a seat right here.
Kenard' s chair.
That aroma is kind of gettin 'to me.
What kind of coffee is that?
It' s not a coffee.
It' s a chai with soy.
Okay, so it' s herbal.
Yeah, it' s herbal.
You must be a lot like me.
You lactose intolerant.
Yeah, I' m lactose intolerant.
I go near a cow, and my behind blow up like Dizzy Gillespie.
Downright flatulent.
And the smell.
Man, the smell that come out of there, it' s so bad, sometimes I have to set myself outside.
I' m not lactose intolerant, all right?
I have a very healthy metabolism.
I tried to have some of them little, bitty Milky Ways... the small one.
I ate two of them at a party one night, and, man, it just got...
I just couldn' t control it.
It was the lactose intoleration.
Listen, I' m not lactose intolerant.
Look, man, all that' s fine.
I' m trying to help you.
It' s just not fair for your date.
You gotta think about if you on a date and you up here sneakin '' em off, and she' s trying to wonder,
"He seem like he dressed nice, he seems clean, but what is that smell?"
And you tryin 'to act like you ain' t got no...
Take care of yourself.
Sir, I am very nice to black people, okay?
Nice to black people?
You better be, especially me.
I keep my stuff with me, okay?
I cut you.
You can look me up on the Internet, www. cut- a- mother. com.
That' s me right there lookin 'at you.
- Hey, watch it!
- Move!
Your precious love
Your precious love
Heaven must have sent you from above
Must have sent you, baby
Heaven must have sent your precious love
Your precious love
To find a love like ours
Stop!
- To find - To find
With your finger.
To find
To find
Your finger goin 'up there, but you not.
I need to find a new tenor.
I wish my brother Darnell was out.
Eddie, where you goin '?
What the hell' s the matter with you?
Taxi!
- Get out of the way, fool!
- I can' t wait for you.
There' s a guy on the other side of the rig!
Get off the truck!
Get off!
You wanna know my name, right?
Yeah.
Loretta.
Yeah.
I' m not saying we made out of money.
I' m just saying we need to step it up a little bit.
We' re about to get punked by Nappy Cutz.
If you don' t think big, you' il never be big.
Calvin, you run a family operation.
You do not need to step it up.
Them clowns at Nappy Cutz, they' re not about to take away your business.
Your shop is a neighborhood institution.
Come on.
People don' t care about institutions.
They got fish in the floor.
Just swimmin 'around.
You can get it fried, baked, sautéed, sushi...
- Who told you that?
- Little Rodney at the shop.
Little Rodney told you he sawfish in the floor.
Well, he actually didn' t see the fish in the floor, but his cousin in Atlanta sawfish.
You know that' s ridiculous.
Little Rodney probably heard it from somebody who heard it from somebody else who was at Nappy Cutz {Y: i} when they dropped their Filet- O- Fish on the floor.
That' s ridiculous.
I can' t believe you said that.
Sun salutation, ladies.
Feet together, bringing it to prayer pose.
And reach!
Butterfly, butterfly.
Bringing it back to prayer pose.
{Y: i} Deep ujjayi breath.
Breathing in radiance, beauty, light.
Breathing out any heavy burdens.
The key to enlightenment is to work through your anger, not have your anger work through you.
First position.
One, two, three.
He ain' t shit!
He ain' t shit!
Jimmy!
What' s the deal?
What' s up?
Lookin 'good, baby boy!
Always, always.
Still ain' t shit.
Just a little while ago, he was cuttin 'hair.
- Good morning.
Good morning.
- Alderman Brown' s office.
- Good morning, Maggie.
- Good morning, sir.
- Any messages?
- Yes, sir.
A whole stack.
- Good morning, Alderman.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Jimmy.
- I' d like a moment if you have it.
- I don' t.
This faithful constituent is in need of counsel, and I have to provide it.
Reach one, teach one.
Remember that.
It' s an issue of vital importance and it' il only take a minute.
- You have 59 seconds.
- Thank you.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you, sir.
Not you.
I wanted to bring to your attention a particular concern of mine.
Are you familiar with Calvin' s Barbershop on 79th and Exchange?
Yeah, I' m aware of it.
They' re opening a Nappy Cutz across the street.
Yeah, I know all about it.
Shouldn' t we do something about that?
Why should we?
Competition is a cornerstone of democracy.
The future is not what it used to be.
Remember that.
But you did say you wanted to keep that particular area fertile for small- business interests.
Fertile.
I did say that, didn' t I?
This boy is gonna be the governor of the state of illinois one day if he learns to do what I say when I say it.
Now, I' m not one for explanations, explanatory things explained.
Write a report and have it on my desk by the end of the month.
Sir, I think we should move faster than that.
Think need, not speed.
It' s better to measure a thing ten times and cut once than to measure once and cut ten times.
Your minute is up, son.
This is gonna be great for the neighborhood.
We' il see.
Here he comes.
- What' s up, Samir?
- Not much.
- How are you doing?
- All right.
Very nice shirt on you.
We need to talk to you, Calvin.
What' s going on?
We' ve been approached by Quality Land Development.
They' re building a cineplex there and they' re making us an offer.
We' re thinking about taking that offer.
The money isn' t bad.
Plus, the money isn' t bad.
Stew sold him his cleaners and took his Viagra- popping ass to Miami.
I ain' t mad at the brother.
What' s that got to do with me?
You got your mind made up.
No, we haven' t.
But I bet if you came on board and sold them the barbershop, they' d probably pay us double.
- That would change my mind.
- Absolutely.
- Y' all know I can' t do that.
- Why not?
We' ve been there since '58.
So if y' all wanna sell and go down to Florida with them funky- ass voting booths, you can go ahead.
But I' ve gotta keep mine.
You' re making a mistake, bro.
No, my friend, you' re thinking about this all the wrong way.
Calvin, there' s a lot of money to be made here, son.
Go talk to your boy.
Come on, babies.
Today is the day.
We came a long road to get here.
Pay attention.
Lighten up.
looking like Joe Frazier in Jamaica.
People don' t like that.
You' re too pretty.
Learn how to cook.
I know how to cook.
Make him hush puppies or a Spanish omelet.
- Hey there, Calvin.
- Hey, Calvin.
- What' s up, Cal?
- Yo, Isaac.
What' s up, boss man?
You all know why I called this meeting.
Nappy Necks, whatever they want to call theyself across the street, is openin 'up in three weeks, and they' re tryin' to get our ass out of here,
like it or not, and we ain' t havin 'it.
- You know what I mean?
- Damn straight.
So my plan is this.
Fire up the barbecue in the back, have a little customer- appreciation cookout.
That' s smart.
That' s good thinking.
Just burgers and dogs, free haircuts for the kids.
Show the people we care about 'em.
Show them that whatever they goin 'through, we down with them.
- You feel me?
- I feel you, Calvin.
Definitely.
Man, I feel all of that.
It all makes sense.
That' s why I got to raise your booth rent.
What?
You can' t do that.
- It' s my first day.
- Why, Calvin?
We got to pay for this somehow.
Forget about it.
We in a crisis, and you can double my rent.
- You don' t even pay no rent.
- What?
In that case, triple it, then.
Not to throw salt, but why you don' t pay no booth rent?
I don' t pay rent 'cause I don' t pay rent.
Okay?
So pour out your cup of haterade and sop it up off the floor and get some business.
Also, I want to institute a couple of new rules.
You comin 'at me with too much.
That' s all for one day.
Take baby steps.
Rule number one... no more profanity.
I know you about to say something.
Don' t even say it.
I ain' t sayin 'nothin'.
I' m thinkin 'it.
Rule number two... don' t be late.
- "... before 11: 00 at the club." - That' s what it was.
Y' all got jokes.
My bad.
{Y: i} Kenard, them Jet beauties, they got to go, man.
Good.
They' re my inspiration, my muses.
He made me take down my picture of Lola Falana.
I can' t cut without the butt.
That' s perfect for me 'cause maybe you' il quit.
That' s what I thought.
We' re going to be more family friendly around here, and I want everybody to start greeting the customers by name.
How are we supposed to know everybody' s name?
That' s ridiculous.
He' s not even showing up.
Yap!
Yap!
Yap!
Yap!
All that yapping leads me to rule number three... no more loud talking.
What?!
Watch it.
Thank you, Calvin.
Horace, thanks, man.
I appreciate your coming through.
All right, Calvin.
- Take care, man.
- No problem.
- Appreciate your business.
- All right, Calvin.
God bless.
All right, Calvin.
Bye, Horace.
You' re next.
What' s up, Cal?
Thanks for what you' re doing.
We appreciate it.
- Hi, Jimmy!
- Hey, everybody.
This is not happening.
We got an appointment.
You gotta get out of the chair.
Eight Mile gave me this time exactly.
We' re almost done.
I' il be right with you.
I' m terribly sorry about the inconvenience.
Calvin, this is why black business does not succeed.
We' re never on time.
You leave early.
Giving to the needy and the greedy instead of the deserving.
And double- booking our clients!
Why do you have a schedule if you ain' t gonna use it?
It is 11: 02.
That means your man has to get out of the chair.
That means it' s my time, and I' m not havin 'it.
Come on, man, you gotta bounce.
This is ridiculous.
Vamoose.
Come on, let' s go.
- Get him.
- Sit your ass down!
Come on, have a seat.
Enough of it already.
Sit on down, West Wing.
{Y: i} Up in here like you' re from Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.
Only reason you' re in here is' cause your daddy didn' t use a Life Style.
I' il tell y' all one thing... all y' all are doomed to fail.
It was nice and quiet in here, the way I like it.
Just hush.
Everything was hush.
Free barbecue... food, fun, and free haircuts for the kids.
Bring 'em on down.
Bring all the kids.
Here you go, girl.
We should have kids so we can bring 'em down to this barbecue Friday.
I think we can squeeze four out of that ass.
I didn' t mean to insult you.
We could probably get five.
What' s up, Tyson?
Free barbecue this Friday.
Don' t be eyeballin 'me.
You ain' t hard.
I' m just playin '.
Boy, it' s hot out here.
I' m tired of handing out these fliers, but my cousin say I gotta do it.
Before they got his ass, they was all over there together...
Saddam, Osama, all of them livin 'in a big old beach house just kickin' it.
Got all the money in the world and some of them ho' s from the Snoop video.
They just freakin '' em.
Freakin 'em all, boy.
- And Idi Amin over there, too.
- I thought he...
No, no, he ain' t dead.
No, he ain' t dead.
You can' t kill no big Yaphet Kotto- looking Zulu nigga.
- You know better than that.
- Eddie, you need to quit it.
Let me get some ribs!
- Can I fix you a plate, Dinka?
- No, I' m trying to watch it.
You don' t need to watch it.
She throwin 'it at you, dawg.
What' s up with that?
Shawna is a nice woman, but I don' t know if she' s the one for me.
Who the one for you?
Terri?
You need to let that go.
That' s not gonna happen.
That' s the good news.
You don' t need a loud, evil, neck- rollin 'chicken- head like Terri.
That' s what you need.
Go on.
Go on over there.
Go on.
Isaac, run to the store and grab me some ice.
We' re running short on ice.
Kenard ain' t doin 'nothin'.
Yeah, man, but I asked you.
Don' t do me like that, man.
Can you get me some ice or not?
No disrespect, Cal, but I' ve been bustin 'my ass in there for you.
I' ve been bringin 'in a lot of business.
- I see you.
- So why you treatin 'me like a scrub?
I treat you like everybody else around here.
I' m happy you got it goin 'on now, but I need some ice.
Can you handle that for me?
- Yeah.
- Get the ice.
Two bags.
Thank you, Isaac.
Where you goin '?
Cal wants me to handle some business.
Store run.
Can you bring back some toothpicks?
Minty freshness.
Oh, yeah.
She want one of Uncle Eddie' s burgers.
That' s delicious.
This is burnt.
No, baby, that ain' t burnt.
That' s barbecue.
See that brother over there?
That' s burnt.
Well, why can' t I have another one?
'Cause you can' t.
Now, look, it' s free, ain' t it?
There' s people over in Ethiopia starvin ', and you sittin' over here complainin '.
- I' m not gonna eat it.
- You sure ain' t.
I hate you!
I' m gonna tell my auntie.
Go to the crack house and tell her.
Ain' t nobody scared!
Tell your auntie!
This is Eddie.
I ain' t scared of nothin '.
You can tell whoever you want to.
- What' d you do to that little girl?
- I ain' t do nothin 'to her.
Little Moesha tryin 'to criticize my culinary skill.
I ain' t scared!
Get your auntie!
Eddie, man, don' t be so crazy.
I should' ve known your old ass was startin 'trouble.
- Hold on, Gina.
- Oh, shit.
- It was just a misunderstanding.
- Ain' t no misunderstanding.
I should' ve known you was out here actin 'a fool.
I' m tryin 'to teach little Sister Souljah here some discipline.
Now, it' s obvious the way she bein 'raised, she headed straight for the peniten- sherary.
Raised?
Maybe if you stopped raising your hand to your mouth, you wouldn' t look like Shamu of the South Side.
Okay.
I see where you' re trying to go with it.
What kind of man treat a little girl that way?
I wouldn' t expect you to know what a man is.
But I' m gonna give you a clue.
Give you a hint, Throw you a lifeline.
It' s one of them things you can' t keep!
Oh, I can keep a man.
I can keep a man.
No, you can' t.
I ain' t want you, Calvin.
What about you?
The last woman you slept with was battery- operated.
So?
And she was white, too.
I had a black one, but the bitch didn' t knowwhen to keep her mouth shut.
- Why' s she gotta be a bitch?
- Why you gotta get up on me?
- Be cool, now.
- Shut up, Calvin.
- Who you tellin 'to shut up?
- You.
Everybody get out of here, little kids and big kids.
I' m gonna tell you what the problem is.
What' s the problem?
What' s the problem?
- You don' t know your role.
- Know your role.
Speak on.
Is you living in the dark ages or something?
- Hell, no.
What' s your role, watching ESPN and holding your shit all day?
What you tryin 'to say?
Get your lazy ass off my couch and get a job.
Get a damn job.
Y' all got all the jobs.
- That' s kind of true.
- Shut up, Calvin.
You got one more time to tell me to shut up.
You got a lot of nerve charging these sisters out here money to get their hair did, and you lookin 'like Chewbacca.
Don' t listen to him.
You look good, girl.
What about you?
Look at that damn 'fro.
What you be doin ', sweepin' up the shop with it?
I do what Calvin need me to do every now and then.
What Calvin needs you to do is get off your fat ass and cut some heads.
How you gonna talk about size when you one Reese' s Pieces away from Jenny Craig yourself?
What you doin '?
Don' t get in my pool.
I' m in your pool.
Let me tell you something, you old negro spiritual.
Wadin 'in the water
I' m gonna kick your ass, and then I' m gonna burn your freedom papers.
And trust me, I' m just big enough to do it.
Can' t nobody argue with that.
Don' t worry.
She ain' t about to do nothin '.
I got a reputation to keep up around here.
And that little girl is a devil child, now.
Look, I know she bad.
That' s why you come to me.
I got to get back at her.
I' m sorry.
You make sure she get that, okay?
Put one of them links on.
- You think she want a link?
- She want a link.
Which one?
Right here?
Give me that one right there.
Okay.
You give her that, now.
You make sure she get that and tell her Uncle Eddie' s sorry.
- Me and you cool, all right?
- Yeah, we cool.
You got a little somethin 'right there.
Get that.
Now get your elbow.
I ain' t got nothin 'on my elbow.
Look like a gingerbread man.
I bet that link don' t make it on the inside.
How' d you get with a girl like that?
Get that door for little Calvin, Junior.
I got what they call that savoir faire.
She fine.
Now, I know you ain' t payin 'that nappy negro no heed.
- Why you even sweatin 'it, Cal?
- That Web site' s been in my head.
That Web site don' t mean nothin ', Cal, man.
Don' t even tell you what it might be like on the inside.
Come on, let' s get ready for our customers.
- Jimmy, hold it there.
- All right.
Yeah, yeah.
What the hell goin 'on?
Since y' all wanna be funny, no rap before 12: 00 now.
Come on, man.
Y' all just clownin 'up in here.
- Eddie, where the hot wings?
- I tried to tell 'em.
You need a man that' s gonna take care of you.
I' m talkin 'about a good man.
A Muslim man.
- And you that man?
- Could be.
Once you a customer, can' t have no relations.
Bad for business.
She just had a pork chop.
She ain' t tryin 'to hear nothin' about no Nation of Islam.
- Shut up.
- I heard that.
That pork be callin 'me, too.
Let me tell you somethin '.
Nation of Islam is more than a pork- free diet.
It is the word of Allah as told to the Prophet Muhammad.
Look, all I know is I' m down with Jesus.
Watch what you say 'cause I' m holdin' the clippers.
- Change the subject.
- Exactly.
I got a question.
You don' t find it odd, as a black woman, to have a savior who looks like Kenny G?
- Kenny G?
- That' s right.
Now, his Christmas album was tight.
Look, Jesus is not white.
He' s Caublinasian, like Tiger Woods.
And you just about workin 'my last nerve.
Pay Calvin.
Speaking of Muslims, is Ahmad Rashad Muslim?
I don' t ever see him wear one of those bowties.
Sorry.
Did I wake you?
Late night of creepin '?
You don' t know jack about me, girl.
You know what your problem is?
{Y: i} You know what one of your problems is?
- You' re bitter.
- I' m through, is what I am.
That nice Terri routine?
Ain' t nobody fallin 'for that.
A nice woman wouldn' t be doggin 'my man Dinka.
Dinka?
Ain' t nobody doggin 'him.
That boy' s in love with you, girl.
But you don' t want a good man, right?
What you want, a roughneck to cheat on you and slap you around?
- What about them bitches you roll with?
- Watch your mouth.
All of them skanky as hell.
"Ooh, I met Shaniqua in the strip club last night."
Those are nice girls?
- You don' t know everything.
- I know enough.
Hidin 'behind some tattoos and a prison record.
- Grow up, be a real man.
- Why you even care?!
Showyou what to do with this.
Take this right up here, put it on the door, twist it... pop!
It' il put you in like Flynn.
You know what else you could do?
You get a half pound of C- 4, put a little timer on it... tick, tick, tick, boom!
Blow up the whole block.
I got some at the crib.
What' s goin 'on?
- No.
- What?
- Don' t even think about it.
- That' s what I told 'em.
I said the same thing.
It' s killin 'me, man.
I just gotta know for myself.
We not breakin 'in to Nappy Cutz.
You want to know what' s in there.
No.
The answer' s no.
We' re not breakin 'in.
I will not allow it.
Hurry up.
Five minutes.
We in, we out.
This is my kind of stuff.
Check this out.
- It' s huge!
- Size isn' t everything.
Keep telling yourself that.
Eddie, what you doin '?
Didn' t we come over here to see it?
I can' t see diddly.
This is the joint, B!
Look at this.
I don' t see no fish in the floor.
Where the fish at?
That' s crazy!
What?
You can say that again.
- Goodness!
- What?
You can' t fry none of that, though.
You can play ball up in here, man.
No, you can play ball down the street.
Like a brother can' t get a haircut without trying to play some ball.
{Y: i} They got the Wall Street Journal.
Top of the line.
This is what a barbershop' s supposed to look like.
- This is leather.
- Word?
- That' s pleather.
- It' s leather.
It' s ugly.
Lookin 'around, it' s a nice shop, but it don' t have no character.
Exactly.
What we got across the street is character.
We got character, we got conversation, and we got...
We ain' t got one of these.
Lord have mercy!
This is pillow top!
Come on, City Hall, show me what you got.
You' re startin 'to get on my nerves.
{Y: i} You' re startin 'to get on my nerves.
Let' s crack it.
I checked it already.
Let' s crack it.
You got me.
Put the ball down.
Oh, shit.
Hey, y' all open?
No, bro, we closed.
Let me in.
Hey, bro, we' re closed.
- Help a brother out.
- We goin 'to jail.
Two seconds, two seconds.
- Just let him in, Big C.
- Don' t let him in.
- We can' t leave him out there.
- Then let him in.
I' m trying.
Kenard, let him in.
Put that paper back up.
Yes!
Hey, y' all!
This place is nice!
We closed.
Go across the street and get your hair cut.
Kind of raggedy over there.
Just a quick touch- up.
I' m flying back to L. A. Tonight.
How about it?
- Who can do me?
- Not me, I got carpal tunnel.
I got you.
You got me?
My man.
We got Nappy Cutz on Crenshaw.
Love it.
Everybody loves it.
Hey, man, get these clippers goin ', player.
These ain' t supposed to be out yet.
This is German- engineered, titanium teeth, silent- whisper engine.
Listen.
- King shit.
- They just clippers.
This would double, triple your business.
You know what?
I' m gone.
Have fun.
Y' all hurry up.
Don' t steal nothin 'and don' t break nothin'.
Just close the back door when you leave.
Hey, Detective.
We was just lookin 'for you.
What the hell' s going on here?
We heard something...
You broke into Nappy Cutz?
- You take anything?
- No.
- Damage anything?
- No.
Kind of nice in there?
No.
Oh, man, they got a basketball court!
He' s beautiful, isn' t he?
I just want him to have everything I never had.
I know you do.
And he will.
So you coming to bed?
Yeah.
You tryin 'to get something started?
I was hoping so, but you better catch me before the rollers go in.
Looks like you gonna have a little brother or sister.
Put them rollers in.
I might like that.
I got contact lenses... blue, green, bloodshot red... left ones only.
Ray!
Just the man I wanted to see.
Come back and talk to me.
- I didn' t know you was workin '.
- Come holler at me.
How' s life been treating you?
It' s been cool.
Me and my girlfriend' s husband got in a fight.
He only won 'cause she helped him.
Good to see you.
Come on back.
- In the back- back?
- Yeah, in the back- back.
With the scissors and everything?
How you been, Cal?
You been going to church and living your life right and everything?
- What you jumping for?
- I ain' t know what you was comin 'with.
My nerves bad.
I' m light- skinned.
Can you get this stuff on this list?
I' m looking to get high- end stuff at low- end prices.
- You know I can.
- Legally.
You mean like with a receipt legally?
Like I ain' t steal it.
If the police walk up, do I gotta drop it and run?
I can get anything you need.
Nappy Cutz won' t know what hit 'em.
This is not about Nappy Cutz.
This is about personal enhancement, personal growth.
Expansion.
Not Nappy Cutz.
Right.
They won' t know what hit 'em.
Come on over here and get your hair cut.
I' m working at Calvin Jr' s.
Come be my first customer.
What you mean, "Uh- uh"?
Can you hook me up with Isaac?
The one with the "I" cut in the back?
You got a 'fro!
You can' t be gettin 'the "I" cut in the back.
Condoleezza.
With all that White House money she makin ', you' d think she could afford herself a makeover.
If I was in the White House, I' d be fly all the time.
If you was in the White House, you' d be ghetto as hell.
She' d have the president all corn- rowed out, talking about, "U. S., fool.
U. S., fool. "
The president would be a thug.
She think a head of state' s a sexual position.
"I' m inviting heads of state today."
Oh, my God.
Please stop.
Gina, do I look like Beyoncé?
Just like her.
I knew you was gonna say that.
Give me some.
like all the gangs coming together.
There' s beauty in there.
You gotta love it, man.
This came from my grandmama church.
They might want that back.
Who' s been chewing on this thing?
It look like Holyfield' s ear.
Picture and picture.
This one get channels 2 through 5, and this one get 9 through 13.
Give me the big one.
Take the little one, too.
You got to take the little one.
- You keep it.
- Cal, you gotta get this little one.
Come on, Cal!
Thought I' d add a little style to the place.
That' s that Picassio stuff right there.
Yeah, yeah.
Beautiful.
What is it, a uterus?
Calvin, I hooked you up with the alderman.
What' d you do, get me some handicapped plates?
Better.
You' re gonna be on the news.
The news?
The alderman' s taking a walking tour of the block before Friday' s city council meeting to let the constituency know that he' s concerned.
Concerned?
About November, right?
I talked him into talking to you... good publicity.
- You could' ve asked me first.
- I know.
But it was a spur- of- the- moment thing.
It' s a place of business.
This ain' t no community center.
You know what?
You sound just like your daddy right now.
We will not be silenced.
When the FBI gassed the Black Panthers out, we found a place to be today.
Thank you, Brother Calvin.
Brother Calvin!
We will continue to provide books and classes, food and clothing through our outreach program.
That' s right, brother.
And when the pigs show up, they' re gonna show up with guns.
{Y: i} We ain' t gonna do nothin 'but show up with our guns!
Then they gonna start shootin '.
Then we gonna start shootin '!
That' s right, brother!
I' m tellin 'you, every last one of them' s gonna get shot!
That' s right.
Then all of us is gonna get shot!
And all of us is gonna die together!
Black power!
Black power!
Yeah!
That' s us!
Black power!
Shit, man, them fools crazy.
Well, if it ain' t Lalowe Sharpton.
My goodness, my goodness.
The barbershop.
How you doin '?
Lalowe Brown.
Checker Fred, sir.
How you doin ', Checker?
Lalowe Brown.
Good to see you.
How you doin ', sir?
Well, well, look at this.
Look what we got... we got a lady barber.
We didn' t have this back in the day.
- What' s your name?
- Terri.
- Sarah?
- Terri.
Lalowe' s gonna have to come back and let you give me a little trim.
- Trim?
- A haircut.
Terri, if you wanna be down, vote Lalowe Brown.
You remember that.
This is Calvin' s Barbershop.
This is a cornerstone of the black community for some 40- odd years.
I' ve been coming down here many a Saturday afternoon, get myself straight for Sunday morning.
But I wanna introduce you to the man himself, the man who quantifies and epitomizes the institutional possibilities of black hair.
He is a potentiating progenitor in all kinds of fine ways.
He' s my fine friend, this brother right here, Calvin.
How you doin '?
Calvin Palmer.
- How you doin ', son?
- All right.
Calvin, you are a pillar of this fine community.
How is everything going for you with all this social change happening down here?
Well, Mr. Brown, as you know, there is a lot of change...
There is a lot of change, and change is hard sometimes, right?
- Tell it!
- Tell it, Lo.
- That' s right.
You let Lalowe lay it down for you.
If you wanna stay afloat, we got to...... you gonna have to rock the boat.
{Y: i} Because if they want to send us packin ', baby, it' s on and crackin'!
And if they try to mess with this brother, then it' s gonna be on like a mother!
That' s a little rough.
If you want to stay around, y' all know what you gotta do.
Vote for Lalowe Brown!
Hey, Calvin, why don' t you get me a little shape- up?
'Cause I' ve been running around.
- You got a chair for me?
- Yeah, right here.
Of course we got one for you.
Kenard!
- Let Kenard cut your hair.
- Hold on, hold on.
Wait a minute.
No.
Get on over there, Get- low.
Sit right on down, So- low.
Nice to meet you.
How you doin '?
- Wait a minute.
It' s okay.
It' s okay.
Kenard here is one of our prima donna barbers.
You ain' t had your hair cut till...
- Kenard.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Let' s take a picture.
- Thank you, brother.
Yeah, okay.
All right.
Enjoy yourself, Low- below.
You just relax, Down- low.
We on TV, man.
I know.
This is must- see TV.
It' s gonna be good.
'cause there' s a historical context for every action that takes place here.
I plan to die here.
We' re running short on time.
If we could speed this up?
You can' t rush the best, Jimmy.
- He ain' t the best.
- He ain' t ask you, man.
Well, who' s the best, then, youngblood?
- You the best?
Isaac Rosenberg.
The best barber in the state of illinois.
The best barber on this rock we call Earth.
Come on down to Cal' s.
Our rainbow coalition right here.
Yeah, this is integration right here.
What' s up, Ma?
Richie?
You' re feelin 'yourself way too much.
Don' t sweat the technique.
What technique?
You cut like a bitch.
Carvin 'I' s in the back of people' s head?
- Your skills is limited.
- My skills are limited?
- Where your skills at?
- This ain' t the time.
Ain' t in cuttin 'hair.
Must be slobbin 'Terri in the locker room.
What?
No.
You ain' t supposed to air our dirty laundry like that.
We on TV.
- What is he talking about?
- Dinka, it wasn' t like that.... of populist politics.
Thug love!
- It was not like that.
'Cause I' m competent?
- You don' t make this shop.
- I have lately.
I will confront all of those forces that are trying to change, that are trying to make things happen.
They don' t treat barbers like this at Nappy Cutz.
Why don' t you go find out?
You on that bullshit.
Go find out.
We don' t need you around here if you don' t wanna be here.
Fine, man.
All right.
Get out of the chair, man.
No, you stay here.
In November, I plan to establish this barbershop as my headquarters.
At Calvin' s Barbershop, we' re gonna make this institution one of the leading institutions, like a torpedo moving towards the future.
Yes, indeed.
All right.
Kenard, just a little off the top.
I really think it' s time for us to move along.
Come on, Jimmy, just two seconds.
My bad, brother.
I skipped you.
Why don' t you just let me fade you up?
- How about a nice Quo Vadis?
- What' d you do to my head?
- Don' t even look at that.
- Is that my head?
I' m gonna kill you!
I' m gonna kill you!
You a grown man!
You don' t do that to Kenard!
Get out of here!
{Y: i} Needless to say, I doubt very seriously if the alderman {Y: i} will be frequenting Calvin' s Barbershop anytime soon.
Nice.
- Who is it?
- It' s Rick.
What do you want?
I wanna talk to you.
I feel bad.
Good.
I' m busy.
Open the door.
We gotta talk about this.
- There' s nothing to discuss.
- Dinka, I messed up.
What happened between me and Terri was foul.
It should have never happened.
I didn' t mean to hurt you.
I' m sorry.
Apology accepted.
Can we discuss this tomorrow?
You remember Shawna, right?
Hi.
What' s up, Shawna?
Handle that.
I' il get at you tomorrow.
Maybe the day after.
You should see her when I' m drinkin '.
'Cause I know her.
Exactly right, exactly right.
What are you doing here?
The question is, what you doin 'here?
Look a little shady to me.
You come up to my shop today and got the nerve to be huddled up with this shark.
Don' t come in here accusing me of some malicious and egregious act when what you should be doin 'is apologizing for making me look like a goddamn fool today.
- That' s what you should be doing.
- Lalowe.
Ease up.
It' s cool.
All right there, youngblood.
Ain' t nothin 'going on in here, just business.
- I' il bet.
- It' s true.
In fact, the alderman and I were just talking about you.
Well, about your business.
I undervalued the importance of your shop to this community.
That' s my bad.
It' d be a shame to see it all go away for naught.
Man, I' m from the South Side.
- Don' t try to hustle me.
- No hustle.
A hustle implies one side wins, the other side loses.
I' m proposing a win- win.
I' m proposing that Nappy Cutz never sees the light of day.
- Is that right?
- I' il turn it into a nightclub.
Your barbershop will continue to thrive without any interference from me or from anyone else.
And this miracle happens if I do what?
Not tell people what I saw here tonight?
What' d you see tonight?
What' d you see in here tonight, Calvin?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Have a seat.
No, I' d rather stand.
All you have to do is talk.
The city council meeting is tomorrow.
We need those other business owners on your block to sell.
If you were to express to them and to the governing board that you believe in Quality Land' s proposal, your voice could be the determining factor.
At least, I think so.
This could be a shitload of money for the whole district.
Not to mention, it could be a nice little windfall for Calvin.
A $200, 000 windfall.
Now, that' s a nice piece of pocket change.
You could take your wife on down to Jamaica.
The real one, not that one in Queens.
It' d be a nice kick- start to your kid' s college fund.
You have a son, don' t you?
Yeah, I got a son.
All you gotta do is talk.
$200, 000.
I' m not asking you for a whole lot, just to... come on down and...... just talk.
Just talk.
All right.
See you tomorrow.
Win- win.
You stalking me?
- Just wanna talk.
- Ain' t nothin 'to say.
Let me drive you to work.
How am I gonna look rollin 'up in your freak- mobile?
Terri, we work together.
We need to have a conversation.
Listen to what I got to say.
After that, you ain' t got to speak to me ever again.
I' il drop you off around the corner.
Get in the car.
Please.
Terri, I really ain' t been myself lately.
Ricky, before you even say anything, I need you to know that thug- gangta- player bullshit is over for me.
I' m done with that in my life.
But you don' t even know me, what I' m about.
I see you every day...
late, sleepin 'in the locker room, runnin' ho' s day and night.
How is that not knowing you?
Boy!
Relax.
What is this, a warrant?
Why didn' t you say anything?
I couldn' t tell nobody I was studying for the fuckin 'GED.
It' s embarrassing.
But you passed.
Yeah.
I don' t even know what it means.
It means you give a damn about your life.
You should be proud.
I' m proud of you.
'cause then I gotta give one back to you.
We' d be all over each other again, and don' t nobody want that.
I don' t want it.
I kind of liked the old Terri before all the changes.
Loud and angry all the time?
Real.
All the time.
Man, I hope you hittin 'that!
Miss Emma, is somethin 'wrong?
Nothing a little prayer can' t handle, or my pistol.
What' s the matter?
They wanna make this funky little place into a co- op.
What?
I can' t afford that down payment.
I' m gonna have to move.
Don' t you own this place?
Just because I don' t own it don' t mean it' s not mine.
You' ve been livin 'here, like, what?
A long time, long enough to wipe your nasty little butt.
And a whole lot of others, too.
But it' s been worth it, though.
We can' t lose you, Miss Emma.
It' s about time for me to retire anyway.
My brother has a nice place out in Arizona.
You ever been to Arizona?
Hot as hell, but I got some nice hats.
How can you leave Chicago?
On the bus.
Same way I got here.
Good morning there, youngblood.
You up early.
They fumigating your crib again?
I thought it' d be a good day to walk and see the trees and dew.
Yeah, they fumigating.
I had a cockroach in my house so big, I thought it was Shaq.
You' re crazy.
- Let me ask you something.
- What?
You done worked and lived around here for what, 34, 35 years?
Yeah, I guess 30 and some change.
I ain' t tryin 'to clown, but...
I hope not.
You know I got jokes.
Don' t you start nothin '.
Let me ask you... is this the life you wanted?
Or did you ever think you could do better?
What the hell keeps you comin 'back here every day?
I' d say the reason I come back in day in and day out is the free chair.
Hold it!
Get off him, pig!
{Y: i} In this difficult day, {Y: i} in this difficult time for the United States, {Y: i} it' s perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are...
This ain' t right.
We should be honoring the man' s memory, we shouldn' t be doing this.
Yeah, you' re right.
I' m gonna get on out of here.
I need to go check on Loretta.
She' s talking about moving back to Georgia.
{Y: i} I had a member of my family killed.
{Y: i} What we need in the United States...
You be safe out there.
Yeah, I will, man.
Don' t worry about me.
I' il probably stop by Montgomery Ward' s, pick up a TV, washer and dryer, lamps.
You need anything?
- Move, Eddie!
- No!
- Eddie, get out of there!
- No!
No!
I' il stay a little while longer, man.
Yeah, so after all that quieted down, your daddy told me I ain' t never have to pay for my chair again.
That' s the kind of man your father was.
He was a man' s man.
He used to always call me a hero.
The funny thing is I never saw it that way.
I didn' t save the shop, Calvin.
The shop saved me.
A lot like it did for Ricky.
I ain' t have no life before this.
As far as I' m concerned, my life began on July 4, 1967, when I came through that back door and your father gave my black ass a break.
So I' d be sad if somethin 'was to ever happen to this place.
But I' d be all right, though.
Oh, yeah, Eddie be fine.
Hey, what' s up, y' all?
Calvin, can I have a word with you for a second?
What you want, man?
Well, I know these are tough times for you, cuz.
It' s times like these when men must rise up and make the right choice.
- Yeah.
It' s about the truth.
Each and every one of us has our own truth, a truth that we must live with for the rest of our lives.
Is there a point to this?
My truth is across the street.
I appreciate the job, cuz.
I' il always love you for it.
But I gotta bounce.
Y' all goin 'broke around this mug.
Boy, I swear.
All right, all right.
And if anybody wanna come over anytime and hoop it up, ring a player, you know?
All this silence got my gut grumblin '.
I' m gonna run down to Berry' s, get me a pastrami and fries.
Eddie, a man at your age should be watching what he eats.
I won' t knock the spear out of yours, okay, Somalia?
Eddie, get me that chicken tamale and strawberry shake special.
Get old Checkers a ham and cheese on some honky bread, mustard, hold the mayo.
Get me a Mountain Dew and chopped salad.
I' il take some chili fries, onion rings, and a pot pie with egg on it.
Okay, that' s gonna be three orders of "Hell, no" and two sides of "Ask your mama" and a large cup of "Negro, please."
Grumpy old man.
Hey, Big C, where you headed?
Nowhere.
Just got a little business to handle.
I' il be back.
And when they build all this stuff, they make it totally unaffordable for the people who live here to stay here.
Now, we' re South Side people with South Side money, and that ain' t much.
So I' m against the proposed Quality Land development project on 79th and Exchange.
You tell it, sister!
That' s right!
Very good!
That' s right!
Okay.
Before we adjourn and make our decision, is there anyone else who' d like to be heard on this matter?
Let' s get this thing over with.
I' d like to say somethin '.
Sir.
- What' s he gonna say?
- Shut up.
Shut up.
A little nervous.
I haven' t felt like this since I met my wife' s pops.
My name is Calvin Palmer.
I own Calvin' s Barbershop over on 79th.
Been there since 1958.
And all I' d like to say is that all change isn' t bad.
Who can argue with progress?
Better schools, cleaner streets... something we need on the South Side.
And I want the best for my son just like my parents wanted the best for me.
So some change on 79th is well- needed and well- deserved.
Oh, yeah.
Also, I' m happy that people outside our community are starting to find the value in our neighborhoods.
But... if that means selling our soul just to make a quick buck,
I ain' t with that shit.
It' s not worth it.
That' s why I' m not sellin 'out...... like some people I know.
Sir, do you know why Jesus wept?
No, I don' t.
Martha and Mary, they cried over his body.
When Jesus sawtheir pain, he couldn' t help but cry, too.
So that' s why Jesus wept.
That' s how I feel when I look at people like Hank Tolliver and Gertrude Rose and Miss Emma bein 'driven out......' cause they don' t fit the plan of the new developers.
We gotta realize that people make this community, not $5 coffees and $20 mugs.
It' s the people.
And once you lose the people, you lose the neighborhood.
So if I had to say, I would deny
Quality Land Development' s proposal to tear up 79th because it just ain' t worth it.
Thank you.
That' s my friend!
That' s my friend!
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Palmer.
We' il take a brief recess and we' il come back with our decision.
You' re through.
You know that, don' t you?
- That was beautiful, man.
- Thanks.
- How much they offer you?
- Not enough.
We have reached a unanimous decision.
The proposal from Quality Land Development has been approved.
This meeting is over.
What have you done?
That' s what I' m talkin 'about.
Money, money, money!
What in the world you people thinkin 'about?
Well, I' il be.
How you gonna leave town without givin 'my ring back?
I' ve been lookin 'for your ass for 35 years.
'cause I knew that' s all you wanted.
Cheap?
You saddity ho, give me my shit.
- You ain' t, either.
Piece of shit, my ass.
- Come here, girl.
- No, you come here.
- You come here.
- No, you come here.
- Get your butt over here.
- No, you come here.
Look at you.
Lord have mercy.
You look good.
You look pretty, too.
- Don' t make me chase your ass again.
- I like when you chase me.
I been 35 years chasin 'after you.
You still got that mattress on the floor?
What you thinkin '?
We might be able to get down there.
I don' t know if we gonna get up.
Nothin 'to worry about.
They ain' t even real Chicago barbers.
- Mornin ', fellas.
- Mornin ', young fellow.
- You finally got a day off?
- I quit.
- No, no.
You know you got fired.
Look at you... your shirt' s still smokin '.
No, I quit on principle.
Politics ain' t my thing.
What' s going on here?
Look at you.
Well, lookit here.
If it ain' t Bobby and Whitney.
Don' t try the opposite- direction thing.
Richard and I are just friends.
"Richard."
It' s "Richard" at work and "Big Daddy" in the bedroom.
Listen, little man, I got a daddy.
I don' t need another one.
So keep your mouth shut before I punch you in it.
She' s back.
- What you doin 'here?
- He got fired.
I did not get fired.
All right, fellas, how you doin '?
Clown.
Clown!
Well, Jimmy, first chair is open.
Your old chair is open.
Quiet as it' s kept.
I don' t know how long we gonna be open.
We gonna find out today.
- Hey, Calvin.
- Good morning.
All right!
Come on.
What the hell he do?
Where the hell is my uterus?
In the Dumpster with the rest of that mess.
If we goin 'out, we goin' out like us.
That' s right.
- Yup.
- What you doin 'here?
- He got fired.
- Whatever.
- You quit?
I ain' t a politician.
- Don' t tell me you quit.
- What was I supposed to do?
Is Lalowe Brown the only politician in Chicago?
Listen, Cal...
Don' t even worry about it.
Don' t worry about it.
Good to have you back.
Good to be back.
Archie Bunker and George Jefferson back together again.
- Respect, man.
- All right, respect.
Yo, what' s up?
- What' s happenin ', y' all?
- What' s goin 'on?
Can somebody tighten me up?
Sit down.
Serve you right.
What' s up, Cal?
What' s up, y' all?
Quick lineup?
What' s happenin '?
I got you, playboy.
Calvin, I like what you said yesterday.
What' s up, man?
Dinka, can you hook me up?
Yes, sir.
No problem.
Leave my customers alone.
That' s Rick' s.
Hey, Rick, I' m next with you.
All right.
Whatever you want here.
It looks to me like the village has spoken.
It' s okay.
Just a minor setback.
Minor.
We can get through this.
"We"?
Young man, you' re on your own.
Remember that.
Hey, Isaac, play somethin '.
Anything but R. Kelly.
Please.
Somethin 'wrong with that boy.
He need some serious help.
We ain' t listenin 'to no R. Kelly.
Hold, now.
Don' t start talkin 'about R. Kelly.
I saw the tape.
Y' all see the tape?
- Yeah, I saw the tape.
- How that boy gonna say it ain' t him?
You can' t believe everything.
The media likes to spin stuff.
- That was him.
- You don' t know.
- I think he was set up.
- He was set up.
He set up the camera.
That' s what he did!
He had his head so far up that girl' s behind, you thought it was Groundhog Day.
Michael Jackson... his problem is he got a Ferris wheel.
How you gonna be a pedophile with a Ferris wheel?
Kobe Bryant... everybody thought he was Mr. Goody Two- shoes.
Come to find out he ain' t have on no shoes.
He didn' t have on no socks, either.
Man, and Luther Vandross.
You done gone too goddamn far.
Don' t talk about Luther Vandross, okay?
Luther' s sick, man.
- No!
Everybody in here sayin 'I can' t talk about Luther Vandross?
No!
I can' t talk about Luther Vandross?
What you gonna do about it, then?
Eddie, that' s what I' m talkin 'about.
That' s enough!
That' s enough!
- The Oubyamywe Peninsula.
A remote and fascinating region teeming with extraordinary marine life.
We chose its mysterious waters as the Belafonte' s next destination.
In preparation for our voyage... the members ofTeam Zissou gathered at my oceanographic observatory... here on Pescespada Island.
This was to be our most ambitious adventure to date... and ultimately a tragic one.
Our team included...
Esteban du Plantier, chief diver... our senior statesman, my closest colleague for 27 years:
Klaus Daimler, 40, engineer - calm, collected, German:
Vikram Ray, 28, cameraman - born on the Ganges:
Bobby Ogata, 22, frogman:
Renzo Pietro, 45, editor, soundman:
Vladimir Wolodarsky, 33, physicist, original score composer:
Anne- Marie Sakowitz, 25, script girl:
Pelé dos Santos, 30, safety expert:
Eleanor Zissou, my wife, vice president of the Zissou Society.
We had also invited seven marine science students from the University of North Alaska... to accompany us as unpaid interns in exchange for school credit.
October 12.
Esteban and I explore the blue reefs beyond the peninsula.
Fluorescent snapper unexpectedly appear in the shallows - extremely rare at this depth.
Where' s your gun?
[Klaus]
Steve!
- Where' s Esteban?
- Is that thing rolling, Vikram?
Encounter with highly abnormal sharklike fish!
Ten meters in length, unfamiliar dorsal features, spots all over it!
I shot it dorsally with a homing dart!
Esteban was eaten!
Check the scanning monitor!
Start tracking before it dives too deep!
Esteban was bitten?
- Eaten!
- Is he dead?
- Esteban was eaten!
- He was swallowed whole?
- No!
Chewed!
Check the scanning monitor!
He' s got hydrogen psychosis.
Crazy- eye.
Steve, we think you got crazy- eye.
- Get him out of the fucking water.
- Esteban!
- Esteban!
Esteban!
- Why' d you throw it over?
- Esteban!
Esteban!
- It' s gone.
- Steve!
- Esteban!
Esteban.!
Esteban.!
Esteban.!
Was it a deliberate choice never to show the jaguar shark?
No.
I dropped the camera.
Why are they laughing?
Yes, what' s next for Team Zissou?
Well, that was only part one.
It' s a cliffhanger.
Now I' m gonna go hunt down that shark, or whatever it is... and hopefully kill it.
I don' t know how yet.
Maybe dynamite.
You don' t know what it is?
- Thank you.
- No.
I' ve never seen anything like it before in my life.
- You say it is a jaguar shark.
That' s the title of your film.
It was coming right at us.
I just said the first two words that came into my head.
That' s an endangered species at most.
What would be the scientific purpose of killing it?
Revenge.
Bravo!
What fun!
I' d like to introduce you to Antonia Cook.
She' s the new head of the film society.
You must be so excited.
I hope so.
You think it went okay?
No, congratulations.
- Seriously.
- Thanks.
I wish it didn' t require the "seriously," but thank you.
Well, I just don' t think they got it.
Shit turnout tonight.
- You know Larry Amin, chairman of Saudifilm.
- Oh, yeah.
- Nice to see you.
- Larry and I were just discussing our financial predicament.
I thought it would be nice if the three of us rode out to the party together.
Why?
Does Larry have that kind of spending bread to invest?
- The king' s backing him now.
- I just got $500 million capitalization from the king.
- Can I get a shot of you with Captain Hennessey?
- Where?
Make it quick.
Hey, Steven.
How' s everything going with your, uh -
- What are you calling it?
Leopard... fish?
- Jaguar shark.
Jaguar shark.
I love it.
Tell me something - Does it actually exist?
You know, Allie, I don' t wanna give away the ending.
Good man.
Oh, here comes our girl.
You' re the most ravishing creature that I' ve ever seen in my life.
- Hello, Skinny.
- Hello, Eleanor.
Is that a new merit badge?
As a matter of fact, it is.
I just became a knight in Portugal.
The presidente gave a special ball and -
Don' t be nice to Allie.
He' s my nemesis.
How could you lay that slick faggot?
Well, I was in love with him at the time.
Yeah, he' s charismatic.
How are you feeling?
I' m right on the edge.
I don' t know what comes next.
Wait here.
I' il be right back.
I just wanted to say hello.
- Hi.
- Hey, baby.
I said I wanted to say hello.
I didn' t say I wanted you to touch me.
I' m here with my wife.
Eleanor, this is Mandeeza.
Mandeeza -
Do we really wanna put me through this?
People say Eleanor is the brains behind Team Zissou.
- [Chuckles]
He' s the Zissou.
Steve.
This is my little nephew, Werner.
He wanted to meet you.
- How you doing, Werner?
- He brought you a present.
A crayon pony- fish.
Wow.
Interesting specimen.
- Thanks, pal.
- You' re welcome.
Steve.
You don' t look too good.
How' s this?
Steve, there' s a bloke over there wants a word with you.
What do you need, old man?
[Speaking Italian]
How many of these do you have?
All right, look, just forge the rest of' em yourself.
Get out of here.
Hey, Steve.!
How come you' re not sittin' shivah for your friend Esteban?
What' d you say?
Who you gonna kill in part two?
- [Crowd Gasps]
Stop!
Larry Amin' s flying back to Mecca tonight to see if he can make the numbers work.
He should have an answer for us in 10 days.
Tell him we need to know by Sunday.
Why would I do that, my darling?
To call his bluff, damn it.
To light a fire under his ass.
My darling, we haven' t made a hit documentary in nine years.
Let' s not fuck with Larry Amin.
- Doubles.
- Explain it to him, will you, Eleanor.
- [Eleanor]
He understands.
Amin needs to make a projection of the world grosses... to see if he can get a tax break and run it through his output deal.
I don' t understand, but I can tell it' s bullshit.
Oh, what the hell is -
- [Ding]
Well, if you' il excuse me, I' m gonna go on an overnight drunk... and in 10 days I' m gonna set out to find the shark that ate my friend and destroy it.
Anyone that would care to join me is more than welcome.
Captain Zissou, I' m sorry to bother you.
- I' m Ned Plimpton.
- Okay, man.
My mother' s Katherine Plimpton.
- You' re kidding.
- No.
- How is she?
- She died last month.
Sorry.
Shit.
She was -
I' ve heard of you.
I don' t know if it' s true or not, by the way.
- Do you?
- No, I don' t.
I haven' t heard from her in 30 years.
I guess it' s too late now.
She never contacted me, you know.
Yes, I see.
You' re supposed to be my son, right?
I don' t know.
But I did want to meet you, just in case.
I appreciate that.
I' il be right back.
Don' t go away.
Sorry about that.
You caught me with one foot off the merry- go- round tonight.
Oh, that' s all right.
I don' t wanna take up too much of your time.
I wanna thank you for talking to me.
- We' il find a way, mate.
- I know we will.
I just had a lovely chat with Si Perlman.
He wants to make a big to- do of the Oceanographic Explorer article.
Possibly give you the front cover.
So do be nice to this girl, Miss Winslett- Richardson, won' t you?
Apparently she worships you... and we dearly need the press.
Oseary, this is, uh, probably my son, Ned.
We just met.
Uh, how delightful.
Anyway, his motherjust died.
Plus, we' re having some problems.
I just think it' d be a very special opportunity for all of us, especially him.
- He needs this deal.
- Okay, bring him over.
Well, he' s right here.
I' m sorry.
How do you do?
- So, what do you do?
- I' m a pilot.
Air Kentucky.
Air Kentucky.
- Yeah.
I don' t know that one.
We hub out of Louisville.
Well, sure.
Landlocked.
I have to tell you, I' ve been a member of the Zissou Society... since I was 11.
Well, I' il be damned.
Look at that.
Wanna kill this?
Frankly, I' d better not.
I don' t usually try grass.
Let me tell you about my boat.
The Belafonte was a long- range sub hunter during the Second World War... which we bought from the U. S. Navy for $900, 000.
This is my mentor, Lord Mandrake.
- [Ship' s Horn Blows]
The sauna... was designed by an engineer from the Chinese space program... and we keep a Swedish masseuse on staff.
Here' s where we do all our different science projects and experiments and so on.
This is the kitchen... which contains probably some of the most technologically advanced equipment on the ship.
Eleanor put together a top- notch research library for us... with a complete first- edition set of The Life Aquatic companion series.
We process our own rushes... and keep a cutting room onboard so we can do an assembly while shooting.
- I can' t find them!
- Once again, please.
This is the observation bubble... which I thought up in a dream, actually.
Two albino scouts swim with the ship.
They' re supposedly very intelligent... although I' ve never seen any evidence of it.
Here is the engine room.
The bearing casings aren' t supposed to look like that... but we can' t afford to fix them this year.
Topside we' ve got the bridge, the minisub, an old chopper... and all kinds of radar and sonar and underwater movie gadgets.
What happened toJacqueline?
She didn' t really love me.
Lord Mandrake.
It' s wonderful.
- Very lifelike.
- I' m not crazy about it.
This guy' s a big- time asshole.
We were roommates at the academy.
He used to be married to Eleanor.
He hogs up all the grant money.
You think you' il want to change your name?
- Ned?
- No, not the Ned part.
Unless you want to.
I meant your last name.
I thought you might like to let me give you mine.
- Ned Zissou.
- Ned Zissou.
Exactly.
Or, if you want to, you can change the first part too.
I would have named you Kingsley, if I' d had a say in it.
Kingsley.
I don' t know.
Maybe I' il stick with Ned for now.
Sure.
That' s okay.
Anyway, I' il order you some correspondence stock.
What are you doing?
I ordered the wine.
Pour it over here, please.
He doesn' t know anything about wine.
Are those assholes talking about me?
- [Whispers]
People say when someone says something like that about you... it' s because they' re jealous.
But it still hurts.
It hurts bad.
That man was damn rude.
He can go straight to hell.
How did she die, by the way, your mother?
She took her own life.
She took sleeping pills.
Why would she do that?
Well, she was in a great deal of pain, you know.
Yeah.
You know, my best friend just got killed.
Esteban.
Yeah, I know.
The old man.
Let' s go to my island.
Well, I, uh - I have to be back in Kentucky on Thursday.
Thursday?
Okay.
That' s okay.
Your cat' s dead.
What?
Which one?
Marmalade.
I' m sorry.
What happened?
A rattlesnake bit it in the throat.
Goddamn it, Eleanor, why do you have to say it like that?
You couldn' t try to break it a little bit nicer?
She' s a rich bitch, you know.
She was raised by maids.
Her parents paid for this island... and two of my worst movies.
People say she' s the brains behind Team Zissou.
People say a lot of things.
What kind of cat was it?
Who gives a shit?
I think it was a tabby.
Ned, wanna come inside, we' il make up a room for you?
Steve, that reporter called.
Ned, wake up.
- [Ned]
- I' m on the echo box.
Push the red button to answer.
Throw on your slop and meet me on the beach in 12 minutes.
The white button?
Okay.
Action!
Only twice before have I had the good fortune to observe a rubber tide... that rare occurrence when hundreds of electric jellyfish... spontaneously wash onto a beachhead at once.
Bobby Ogata brings exactly this to our attention tonight.
Steve, what produces this effect of illumination?
Is there a chemical inside the organism?
No, Ned.
Actually, it' s the reflection of the moonlight on their outer membranes.
That' s a very good, uh, ad- lib.
Klaus, come over here and get a two- shot of me and Ned.
Ned, come in here.
Would you like to join my crew?
- Would I like to - - I want you on Team Zissou.
- I don' t think I can do that.
- Why not?
Well, it' s not my field.
- I don' t have the background for it.
- No one here does.
Klaus used to be a bus driver.
Wolodarsky was a high school substitute teacher.
We' re a pack of strays.
Don' t you get it?
Steve, I' m not even that strong a swimmer.
The answer' s yes.
Well, it' s got to be.
I' il order you a red cap and a Speedo.
Cut.
Klaus, why aren' t you rolling?
- Could I have a word with you, please?
- Why aren' t you getting this?
That was a goddamn tearjerker.
- Why did you cut it, man?
- Because the sound is going to be shit.
He doesn' t even know how to hold a boom.
He doesn' t know diddly- jack about what we' re doing.
Don' t cut unless I say "cut."
I' ve never seen so many electric jellyfish in all my life!
Those are Vietcong man- of- wars.
She' s right.
I guess we' il have to loop that line.
- Where' d you come from?
You look pregnant.
- I am pregnant.
I' m not even going to ask what you men are doing out here in your matching pajamas.
We' re producing a film, as a matter of fact.
Who are you?
I' m Jane Winslett- Richardson.
- I' m the reporter from the Oceanographic Explorer.
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- How' d you get out here?
- I hired some drunk in a fishing boat.
That would take four hours.
Why would you do that?
Because no one picked me up at the f- ing airport!
Jesus Christ, Klaus.
One of my guys was supposed to do that.
How long have you been working with Zissou?
Uh, approximately -
Only 10 minutes, actually.
I was hired during the scene on the beach.
He' s Steve' s son, supposedly.
You are?
No, you' re not.
He doesn' t have one.
Well, we' re not 100% sure about that yet.
We just met yesterday.
- Not this one, Klaus.
- Hmm?
You heard me.
Not this one.
Okay.
- First thing in the morning, huh?
- Just print everything?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
What are you gonna do with him?
Who?
Ned?
What do you mean?
I don' t understand the question.
I offered him a spot on the Belafonte.
He didn' t take it, did he?
Of course he took it.
We' re gonna put him on the map, Eleanor.
We' re gonna throw him a life preserver.
I believe in this boy.!
Why?
Because he looks up to me.
Yes, sir.
And McKinnon' s willing to take over my shuttle flights.
That' s right.
Well, I just feel I need to see this thing through, sir.
Thank you for understanding.
I' il check in with the Louisville office again next month.
"So much so that, perhaps ifher eyes had not been quite so black...
"which was what struck one most forcibly on first meeting her...
- [Continues]
- "I should not have been, as I was... so especially enamored of their imagined blue -"
Hold it.
That' s poetry?
No.
It' s a six- volume novel.
Oh, I see.
You' re gonna read that whole thing to yourself out loud?
I' m not reading it to myself.
I' m reading it to him.
When did you learn Zissou was your father?
- Does it freak you out for me to ask that?
- No, it doesn' t.
But it' s a difficult question.
I sorta pieced it together over the years.
Well, how did he first contact you?
He didn' t.
I went looking for him last month, after my mother died.
She had ovarian cancer that spread to her stomach and liver.
She took her own life.
Oh.
Well, good night, I guess.
Good night.
You mind if I stay and listen for a little while?
Okay.
Do you want me to catch you up in the story?
No.
I' il be able to figure it out.
I' il just catch as catch can.
They made these for about... three and a half years before they terminated my sponsorship.
These are great.
- May I turn this on?
- Fire one.
So, what happened, in your opinion?
What are you talking about?
Don' t you think the public perception of your work has altered in the last five years?
That' s your first question?
I thought this was supposed to be a puff piece.
Should we come back to it?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Is it true that this is going to be your last voyage?
No comment.
Who told you that?
No, goddamn it.
I' m - I' m only 52.
How about we start out with some stock dialogue?
You know, favorite color - blue.
Favorite food - sardines.
How do you feel about part one of your new film?
Why?
How do you feel about part one of my new film?
- Well, I' m honest, so - - Just say it.
I thought aspects of it seemed slightly fake.
- Wolodarsky?
- I' il take five, Steve.
Did it seem fake... when my best friend was bitten in half right in front of me... then eaten alive, screaming?
And I think you' re a phony... and a bad reporter.
How does that feel?
Now tell me something.
Does this seem fake?
How dare you?
This entire article was my idea.
- No one else gives a shit.
- What about Si Perlman?
Are you joking?
He' s not even covering my expenses.
You' re taking something out on me.
Oh, stop crying.
What' s the deal here?
I was only trying to defend myself.
Well, you did a great job.
- I' m sure you' il make a terrific father.
So, you really think you' re a Zissou.
I don' t know.
Well, you traveled a long way for "I don' t know," sonny.
That' s true.
But it' s important to me.
Yeah?
Well, there are a lot of things that are important to some people around here, sonny.
- Klaus, don' t call me "sonny."
- And one more thing.
It' s the Steve Zissou show, not the Ned show.
- You hear me?
- Yes, I do.
- Klaus!
- Ja?
If you ever touch me again, I will kick your goddamn teeth out.
Is that understood?
Not if I don' t see you first, sonny.
We gotta watch ourselves around this Jane character.
Don' t tell her anything personal.
If you' re not sure about something, change the subject... and look for me.
This bull dyke' s got something against us.
I don' t think she' s a lesbian.
She' s pregnant.
Bull dykes can get pregnant.
Anyway, I' d back out now, but we need the press.
See you in the morning.
- Hmm?
When' d you first hear about me?
About five years ago.
I... read it in an article about myself.
Did you believe it?
It was in the paper.
I assumed they checked their facts.
Why didn' t you contact me?
Because I hate fathers and I never wanted to be one.
I forgot.
Your correspondence stock came in.
- [Answering Machine Beeps]
Started today.
I' il forward some pages to you through the copy department.
You' re probably right, though.
What am I doing here?
I miss you, and -
Oh, God, I don' t know, Ross.
Where are you?
Listen, I' m not leaving this message.
Don' t even know why I' m still pregnant.
Script girl uses these for continuity.
- Here.
- Oh, no, no, no.
No exceptions.
Everyone gets one.
Anne- Marie!
Do the interns get glocks?
No.
They all share one.
Take it, Ned.
- Steve!
- What?
Whack on the echo box.
Zissou here.
Steve, Oseary Drakoulias on line two.
- Yeah?
- I spoke with Larry Amin.
And it' s a pass.
In other words, you fucked us!
Let' s not cast stones at one another, my boy.
- Do you hear me, damn it?
Do you?
- No, I don' t!
- Oh, bloody hell!
Listen here, mate!
Can I interrupt for a moment?
Who the blazes is that?
It' s me, Ned.
Maybe this is nothing.
Maybe it' s something.
I don' t know your problems.
I don' t know.
But I just inherited $275, 000.
Would that amount make any difference?
What sort of expression is the lad wearing on his face?
Can you fly a chopper?
I have.
I' m certainly not licensed in any way, shape or form.
Great.
Let' s go.
When was this whirlybird last serviced?
I don' t know.
Klaus is supposed to check it every six months.
You' re back on the water, boys.
The wire transfer came straight through from Kentucky.
Jackman and Wordsley are going to gap- finance the rest.
But we have a few hooks on it, so take a pew for a spell.
Number one, the bank want a drug screen for everyone on the crew... before they' il forward the money.
- A piss test?
- Yes, a piss test.
Two, a stooge from the bond company... will be riding everywhere during the whole shoot to keep you on budget.
- Who' s the stooge?
- A chap by the name of Bill Ubell.
And there' s not a damn thing you can do about that, Steve.
Three, you must swear - legally swear - that you' il not kill that shark, or whatever it is, if it actually exists.
I' m going to fight it, but I' il let it live.
What about my dynamite?
Phillip, dynamite.
I' m off to Zurich.
Follow me, chaps.
Mr. Ubell, I' d like you to know...
Steve Zissou and our equity partner Ned.
I hope you' re not gonna bust our chops, Bill.
Why would I do that?
Because you' re a bond company stooge.
I' m also a human being.
I take that back.
Yeah.
Let' s have some "teamsmanship."
- Come on.
One, two, three.
Attaboy.
Attaboy.
Here he is.
Here he is.
You okay, Ned?
You okay?
All right.
Give him some room.
He' s okay.
He just drank a little too much water.
How you shooting this, Vikram?
Wide open?
Uh, light, 5. 6.
[Zissou Narrating]
As always, even in the most challenging circumstances... the members ofTeam Zissou find ways to keep morale high.
Wait.
Hold it.
Is that a distress bark?
Is something wounded out there?
We quickly locate the source of the mysterious cry.
What is she, Steve?
A wild snow mongoose.
We thought they were extinct.
Her ankle' s broken.
- Ogata.
- Yeah?
Run and get some hot milk and put these guys in the incubator.
We radio for the emergency transport of our rare, beautiful new friends.
That' s what it used to be like.
Had Ned' s heart stopped beating before you pulled him out of the water?
Had Ned' s heart stopped beating... before we pulled him out of the water?
Yes.
But we got him started again pretty quickly.
Don' t go on this voyage right now, Steve.
One of you' s already dead, after all.
Who?
Oh, you mean Esteban?
Thanks for bringing that up.
Who' s gonna tell us the Latin names of all the fishes and everything?
You know I can' t remember all that shit.
Please stop, Eleanor.
Eleanor, stop.
- Why are you leaving?
- Because I don' t want to be part of whatever' s gonna happen.
Nobody knows what' s going to happen.
- And then we film it.
That' s the whole concept.
- That' s how we' ve always done it.
I can' t believe you took that boy' s money.
He' s an investor.
He' s my sidekick.
The sugar crabs are back.
They' re early this year.
I' ve never seen them mating before the solstice.
Is that mating?
- Good- bye, Steve.
Don' t say that, even if it' s true.
It' s too painful.
What do you want me to say?
Say bon voyage.
Bon voyage.
Junior- grade diving tech, executive producer.
Energetic, spirited, youthful.
But its power tubes have seized up and blown a gasket.
We now proceed... to an advanced system located on a colleague' s offshore facility.
This will be Team Zissou' s next stop.
See, Renzo?
This is what I' m talking about.
A relationship subplot.
There' s chemistry between us, you know.
Huh?
- Here' s a quote.
- Wait up.
Who from?
"to the life of the sea.
"He speaks its language fluently.
I' ve never met a boy like that in all my life. "
Lord Mandrake.
- You should have opened with that one.
- He was your mentor -
Hey, intern?
Get me a Campari, will ya?
On the rocks?
Wanna go up in my balloon?
I like her hairdo.
Me too.
But Steve called her first.
- I' m sorry I made you cry the other day.
Oh, that' s okay.
It' s not completely your fault, anyway.
I' m going through some personal problems.
Really?
What do you got?
Well, I' m five months pregnant.
My editor' s the father.
He' s married.
But not to me.
That' s a rough ticket.
You know, my first wife left me when I was your age.
- What' s "Deep Search"?
- My submarine.
I had this exact image of you... tacked up on the wall above my aquarium all through primary school.
Oh, yeah?
You mean the official photograph, where I' m doing this?
- Mm- hmm.
Well, maybe it' s just me, but I don' t feel like that person.
I never did.
- Why did you abandon Ned?
I didn' t.
I never even met him.
What kind of piece are you writing, cubbie?
Are you gonna screw us on this deal?
I hope not.
You really think it' s cool to hit the sauce when you' ve got a bun in the oven?
- Pelé, bring us back down, please.
I don' t have a problem with objective reporting.
What I have a problem with is some wombat... coming on my boat trying to railroad me.
See if you can get one of these dolphins to swim under the hull... and give us a look.
Nah.
Either they can' t hear us, or they don' t understand.
Son of a bitch, I' m sick of these dolphins.
Quiet out there tonight.
Can you hear the jack- whales singing?
Beautiful.
I wonder what they' re saying.
Well, that was the sludge tanker over there, but -
- [Whale Song]
That' s them.
By the way, would you mind if I made a few modifications to the Team Zissou insignia?
- I have some ideas - - You mean the patch?
The insignia.
Yeah.
It' s probably kinda dated, isn' t it?
Take a crack at it.
Make it a little trendier.
All right.
Are you finding what you were looking for... out here with me?
I hope so.
I wrote you a letter about 17 years ago.
You mean, like, a fan letter?
Did I write you back?
I try to answer as many personally as I can.
"Dear Ned Plimpton...
"First, in answer to your question, always.
"Second, thank you very much for naming your bug after me.
"My wife tells me it is actually a type of gnat.
"You strike me as a very special boy and a key member of the Zissou Society.
"I wish I could come visit you in Kentucky and assist you with your work.
"I remember your mother.
"Take care of yourself, Ned Plimpton.
You' ve served well.
Your friend, Capt. Steve Zissou.
Dictated, but not read. '"
Yeah, more or less standard boilerplate, I guess.
There' s some real high- tech gear... inside this deal, believe me.
First we go downstairs and turn on that tracking system.
Then, as long as the batteries on that homing dart haven' t gone down -
- Who locked us out?
- No one.
We' re trespassing.
Steve, are we allowed in here?
It' s a scientific community, man.
Captain, I am required by law... to notify the bank of any illegal activities.
Just do what you' ve gotta do to cover your ass, Bill.
I got it.
- [Alarm Blaring]
They wired it!
Klaus, go down and get me some cable snippers.
This is Captain Hennessey.
You have trespassed on a private facility.
The coast guard is being alerted via satellite.
Again, this is Captain Hennessey.
Immediately leave the prem -
Okay, action.
Well, look who' s back in town.
You' ve traveled over 150 miles since we last heard from you.
This son of a bitch is heading for the South Pacific.
Turn on your tape recorder, cubbie.
- Is it the jaguar shark?
- On the record, yes.
Cut.
Print both takes, Vikram.
Was I... just in the film?
Yeah.
You' re gonna have to sign a release.
But you' ve actually located the shark?
You' d better bet your fuckin 'ass we did.
All right, everybody, we got about 25 to 30 minutes... before the coast guard gets here to arrest us.
I want you all to get Hennessey' s best gear onto the Belafonte in 15.
- You' re gonna steal his stuff?
- Nah, we' il get it back to him.
Interns, let' s see some hustle.
Uh, what is this, Pelé?
I don' t know.
Uh, the map?
- Steve!
- Uh- huh?
Do you know that you just charted us on a course through unprotected waters?
Yeah.
We' re taking the shortcut.
But it' s outside I. M. U. Jurisdiction.
There isn' t any protection.
I know, honey.
Look at the map.
We go your way, that' s about four inches.
We go my way, it' s an inch and a half.
You wanna pay for the extra gas?
What kind of system is this?
It' s the Bernstein Nines.
They just upgraded last summer.
The Nines are out already?
- Does this do cappuccino?
- Ja.
Wait a second.
Steve, this isn' t the procedure.
One of the interns just fell down the stairs with the main tracking processor.
Just make sure we steal the backup.
Are you listening to me?
Eleanor told me that under no circumstances -
Shut up before you jinx us, Anne- Marie.
- You catching anything?
- Mm- mmm.
Hook this up and make me a latte.
You know, cubbie' s kind of a sucker- maker... but she' s got some moves.
I agree.
If she wasn' t a bull dyke, I think I might have a bit of a thing for her.
As you can see... if the creature continues its current migratory route... our paths should converge in less than four days.
Ogata, can we -
Vladimir, what' s this blip right over here?
I don' t know.
I' ve been trying to figure that out.
We might have them both mixed up, or it could be the other way around.
But we' re gonna be right on top of it first thing in the morning.
- Good eye, Ned.
- Thank you.
Should we investigate it?
Yeah.
Let' s make a quick dive at 6: 00 a. m., and we' il scope out the phantom signal.
- Yes.
But I wanna be back on the road by lunch.
Do me a favor.
Next time you get a hot idea in front of the reporter... whisper it in my ear first.
Otherwise I look like kind of a daydream johnny.
You know?
Daydream johnny, yes.
You let him change your name?
Well, we changed it together.
- What was it before?
- Edward Plimpton.
That' s a million times better.
Change it back, Ned.
I really don' t see you as a Kingsley Zissou.
Do you think Steve and I have a family resemblance?
No.
I guess it doesn' t really matter anyway.
Here.
I stole it back.
I strung it on some peppermint dental floss... in case you wanna wear it like a necklace.
Happy with the piece, Jane?
What are you doing in here?
Am I?
No.
Put that down.
I assume I' m Mr. Z.
I' m sorry that you think my red hat is, uh -
What' s the word you use?
"Contrived."
And that...
"The Zissou of my childhood represents all the dreams I' ve come to regret."
What?
Why?
I' m going to have to start locking my f- ing door.
It was locked.
I kicked it in.
Why don' t you just curse like other people?
Because I' m trying to get out of the habit before I have my fucking baby!
Okay.
That makes sense.
Well, please clean up your room anyway.
- It looks like a goddamn typhoon hit it.
- Get out!
Please don' t make fun of me.
I just wanted to flirt with you.
I' il have an intern come and fix the door.
This is a message from the I. M. U. Coast guard.
Apparently some crooked fuckers broke into my sea lab yesterday.
How awful.
Did they nick anything?
It doesn' t say.
They probably just trashed the place.
I' m so pissed I wanna spit.
Hugo - [Spits]
Tell Carl to load my elephant gun... with buckshot.
We' re gonna hunt down these sickos.
Supposedly Cousteau and his cronies... invented the idea of putting walkie- talkies into the helmet.
But we made ours with a special rabbit ear on the top... so we could pipe in some music.
- Let' s start with the reverse.
Okay, roll it, Vikram.
Would it be possible for me to address you as Dad in this scene?
No.
Why?
Oh, excuse me.
I' m sorry.
I forgot.
I - I' m sorry.
Where are you coming from, jack off?
Shit.
It' s not a bad impulse though.
Some kind of nickname.
Not that one.
It' s too specific, but try to think of something else.
Another name?
How about Stevesy?
That' s good.
What were you gonna say before?
Good luck, Stevesy.
Fantastic.
Let' s go.
Okay, action.
Look, Ned.
There' s a sunken airplane down there.
Let' s check it out.
We examine the crash site, but are careful not to disturb the forensic evidence.
- How was that?
- Not bad.
The first take was a little faster.
Is that yours?
- Klaus.
- Klaus.
- Ja?
May I have a word with you, please?
What?
- Why' d you do that?
- Because I owed you one.
But you gave me a warning already.
- You stood up for yourself.
- I still owed you one.
- No.
Now we' re even.
Why are you doing this?
He' s not my father, you know.
I don' t have that.
What are you talking about?
"We' re even," damn it.
That' s it!
No, it was like a beat- up little jalopy.
I don' t know what you' d call it.
You didn' t see it?
I didn' t see it, boss.
Well, keep your eyes peeled.
Klaus, check who' s on watch.
I' il be in the sauna.
Pelé and -
Who the shit is Kingsley Zissou?
- Is that him?
- Mm- hmm.
That' s him.
I' ve never felt a baby in someone' s stomach before.
I think you' il make a very good single mother.
- Thanks.
- Although it does put you both at a tremendous disadvantage.
You know...
Steve' s got a little bit of a thing for you.
Why do you say that?
Because he told me.
Really?
I thought he hated my guts.
Well, I think you hurt his feelings, but that doesn' t mean -
He says I hurt his feelings?
So... f' d up.
Five, four
Three, two
- Yeah?
Steve, would you please open the door?
Jane, is, uh, Ned in there?
Stevesy?
Stevesy, what' s happenin '?
Are those hijackers?
Well, we call them pirates out here, Ned.
You were supposed to be on watch, by the way.
Oh, my God.
You' re right.
Stevesy, look.
- [Yelling]
No.
So, tell me, you were reading to each other in French?
No, it' s in English.
It was translated.
Well, you know, you' re not supposed to go into each other' s cabins on a boat.
- Why not?
- It' s just kind of... an unwritten maritime rule when you' re at sea.
Especially the goddamn lookout.
- I' m so sorry.
- So am I.
You hung us out to dry.
If we don' t handle this right... we' re gonna all get murdered.
- [Jane Whimpers Softly]
I' m gonna kill you for that, asshole!
I' m gonna hit you so fuckin 'hard you' il be blind!
Please don' t hurt him.
Watch me.
I' il let you know when I' m gonna make a move.
Steve, it' s way safer for us to just do what they say.
They probably just want our money and jewels and shit.
Yeah.
Then how am I gonna finish my movie then?
Jesus holy f -
They' re going to kill us, Steve.
All right.
I' m pattin' you on the back right now, Klausie.
Don' t be scared.
I' m gonna get us through this, everybody.?
Ogata, cómo est? pal?
Wake up, Ned- o.
I' m sorry I yelled at you.
Mom says we have to be polite to her dates...... and we will if he makes it to the door.
Merry Christmas, sucker.
And don' t come back for Kwanzaa.
Think you' re going out with our mama?
I' m gonna get you two.
Get me out of here!
Lindsey, you really think Dad' s coming back?
Any day now.
But until then, we have to keep Mom available.
Problem is, she' s just too pretty.
That just makes our job a whole lot tougher.
Sometimes I feel sorry for her.
Well, I feel sorry for the next sucker who tries to put the moves on her.
Mr. Persons.
My man.
What you got for me?
Got that newcar smell, you know?
This puppy' s missing one thing.
Welcome to the big leagues, Satch.
Let' s make it happen.
Look at this ride.
Parchment leather with the satin nickel trim.
Holla.
Nick Persons.
How' s it going, man?
How' s it look?
Keep driving, fool.
That' s the one that sicced her dog on you.
What?
You want some of this, huh?
You want a piece of me?
Oh, my goodness.
Six thousand pounds of respect.
Yeah.
It' s nice, huh?
Yeah.
Take it for a spin?
Yeah.
I don' t think so.
Man, what did that unit set you back?
I got a good deal on it.
Your payments probably cost more than my car.
Marty, my shoes cost more than your car.
Look, Nick, here come your favorite customers.
Hey, mister, you got any YuGiOh?
What you think?
You got any Dragon Ball GT?
Look, you come in here every day asking the same questions.
We ain' t got no Pokémon, no Digimon, no Buffy, no SpongeBob...... no Beanie Babies and no shoplifters.
Now, get!
Both of y' all, get!
You better get out of here.
You got a way with kids.
They' re like cockroaches...... except you can' t squish them.
You gonna clean that?
I don' t do windows.
What?
It' il dry.
People wanna know why I hate kids.
What' s the matter with you?
I think I' m in love.
Love?
No...
What do you mean, love?
Oh, yeah, that' s the new girl from the partyplanning place.
Yikes.
She' s so fine.
Yeah.
Whoa, whoa.
She' s a divorcée, man.
That' s way too much baggage for a guy like you.
Don' t be so quick to judge people, man.
This isn' t the Nick the Quick that I know.
Hey, I had broccoli yesterday.
Sometimes you got to try something new, my friend.
Look and learn.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
How was school?
I got 1 00 on my test.
Big deal.
Okay, all right.
Who wants to go shoe shopping?
Let' s go.
What happened?
Oh, man, she' s a breeder.
Two of them.
Hey, wait!
Oh, no.
Help!
Do you have any jumper cables?
No.
No!
Hey, Nick, don' t do this.
She' s got two kids and a brokendown car.
What' s next?
You gonna ask her mama to move in with us?
Oh, I' m so happy to see you.
I' ve been standing out here forever.
You know what?
This might not be a good idea, because we got rain, electricity.
Oh, but I sure do appreciate it.
Okay.
You know, you look so familiar.
Have we met before?
Well, I' m Nick.
I work right across the street from you.
Oh, that' s right.
You' re the guy that owns that cute little toy store.
Fine sports collectibles.
Fine sports collectibles.
I' il hook this up for you.
I think my car hates me.
Oh, but, Nick, this is a nice ride.
Oh, you like this, huh?
Yeah.
It even heats the undercarriage.
I like it.
"I like it."
Remember the score: one player, two kids and
Holy moly!
Oh, that is so cool.
That' s a Satchel Paige bobblehead.
That' s when he played for the Monarchs.
What?
A woman that knows a little something about Satchel?
He was my daddy' s idol.
He pitched for five decades...... including three shutout innings for the Royals at the age of 59.
Well, you know, my man Satch used to have a saying:
"Age is a question of mind over matter.
lf you don' t mind, it don' t matter. "
You know that?
This is Suzanne.
Now, that' s a woman.
Plenty of smarts, easy on the eyes, and can quote my stats.
I don' t care if she got 1 00 kids.
I like her.
All we gotta do is lose the small fries.
Now, I' m not saying drop them in the shark tank.
No.
But there' s nothing kids like more than military school.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Excuse me?
I don' t mind.
lf you need a lift, I' il give you a ride.
Oh, okay.
Smooth, Nick.
Here' s how I think that we gonna make our move.
Pretend like you gonna help her with her seat belt...... then with your free hand, put your arm around her shoulder and Hey!
Let me out!
How am I gonna wave you home if I can' t see the play?
I' m a halloffamer.
How about showing some respect?
And that' s my story.
What about you, Nick?
Are you local?
Black man from Oregon?
Right.
No.
I' m from St. Louis.
I actually moved out here to play TripleA ball with the Beavers...... but ended up hurting my shoulder, and it kind of ended my career.
Oh, you threw your arm out pitching.
Well, not exactly.
I tore my rotator cuff lifting my bigscreen TV out of a UHaul.
That' s really sad.
I know.
Good thing there' s athlete' s insurance, in case you do something stupid.
So, you know, I was wondering...... if maybe you' d consider lf you wasn' t busy
What is going on out here?
Mom, where have you been?
Miss Mable burned our dinner, fell asleep and just keeps farting.
Kevin and Lindsey, this is Mr. Persons.
He was nice enough to give me a ride home.
What' s he want, a reward?
You know what?
I really better get out of here.
Smart.
Hey, Nick?
I don' t mean to be a pest...... but I was just wondering if you could give me a ride to work tomorrow.
Of course.
Oh, great.
Thank you.
See you tomorrow.
Mom, do you know what time it is?
Excuse me, I' m the mother.
Get in the house.
Get in the house.
It' s raining.
Get in the house.
Who is this stud, Nick?
You' re supposed to be in bed.
Nick, thank you so much for helping me these past couple days.
You are so sweet.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, does this seem ripe to you?
I don' t know.
I don' t eat food unless it has an expiration date on it.
Nick, you are funny.
You eat worse than my 7yearold son.
You kind of dress like him too.
What' s wrong with that?
And do you know I have never seen you without a hat?
You don' t need to see me without it.
Let me see.
What' s under there?
Get back.
Get back.
Give me that.
Hang on.
Don' t move.
Nick, wait.
Right.
Wanna go to my apartment?
No, I can' t.
I can' t.
I' ve thought about it.
I really have.
But let' s be realistic.
I' m a single mom.
No, you' re a sexy mama.
Do you know this whole time we' ve been hanging out...... you' ve never once asked me about my kids?
How they doing?
I bet you don' t remember their names.
Rudy and Theo?
Nick.
I think we should just be friends.
Next point wins.
Let' s go.
Next point wins.
Let' s go.
Hold on to your earrings there, Yao Bling...... because I' m gonna embarrass you.
And it' s gonna hurt because I love you.
Give me that.
Hey, that' s a foul.
Come on, man, you hit my hand.
No, I didn' t.
Right here.
Game time.
Yeah, baby.
Byebye.
Byebye.
Get off of me, Lurch.
That was a moving pick.
Let' s run it again.
Come on.
No.
I gotta go, y' all.
What?
We' re tied.
Somebody has to lose.
It' s the American way.
Hey, somebody did lose.
You know I gotta go do that thing.
What thing?
What?
You know, I gotta take Suzanne to the airport in the morning.
Take Suzanne to the airport in the morning.
You are stuck in the friend zone.
Get out of here.
Listen to me.
We' ve been friends a very long time...... and I am telling you, you gotta dump this girl.
What?
We not even going out.
That' s the point, Nick.
Whatever it is you don' t have going on, it has got to end.
Okay, for all those who listen to this clown...... Nick Persons will never be in the friend zone.
Understand that and believe that.
Friend zone.
Friend zone.
Friend zone.
Here you go.
Oh, Nick, thank you so much.
You are such a great friend.
The friend zone is for losers only.
Please unload your friend and get on with your life.
Well, wish me luck.
Good luck.
Thanks for everything, Nick.
Suzanne, can I talk to you real quick?
Sure.
You know, what we got going I mean, we don' t really have something
I don' t really know what to call this...
Hang on.... but it seems kind of...
This is Suzanne.
Yes, Frank.
Just one sec.
Well, when did that happen?
Well, actually, I' m already at the airport.
You can' t park here.
I know.
My friend' s making a call.
She' il be off in a second.
Gonna be an expensive call.
I' m right here.
That' s why you' re getting a ticket.
They' re expecting to spend New Year' s Eve with you.
Oh, don' t Don' t even go there with me, Frank.
You haven' t spent five minutes with your kids since Labor Day.
Frank, you know what?
I am so sick of this.
I Hello?
Hello?
Know what?
That lady' s got enough problems.
I' m not going.
What' s the matter?
My ex is sick, and he' s not gonna pick up the kids.
What about the babysitter?
She' s leaving for Las Vegas...... with her church group.
Oh, no.
You know, my kids miss him so much...... and all he ever does is pull the rug out right from under them.
I' m gonna lose my job.
What if I bring them?
I couldn' t ask you to do that.
That' s too much.
Why not?
Look, it' s no big deal.
Serious.
Really?
Positive.
Are you sure?
I wanna help you on this.
Nick, this is huge.
Thank you so much.
You are a lifesaver.
Okay, so I' il get the three tickets, and as soon as you guys land, call me.
Oh, no, I meant that I' il drop them off at the airport.
Oh, no.
You can' t expect the kids to travel alone, Nick.
Kevin' s got asthma.
That recycled air in the plane I mean, yuck.
But it' d be fine.
Kids fly all the time.
It' s nothing.
I' il make sure they get on the plane.
They' il get milk and cookies, little plastic wings, get to meet the pilot.
You know, it' d be real cool.
Especially with me sitting next to them making sure everything is all right.
Oh, how could I ever repay you?
Obviously, you don' t care that she' s using you.
But ask yourself this:
Would you trust a woman who' d trust you with her kids?
I' m tempted to call Child Services right now.
Uncle Nick loves kids.
Big lummox.
Might as well just put myself on eBay.
Hello.
I' m here to pick up the kids.
Now, that' s what I' m talking about.
What you wasting your time with Miss Suzanne for?
Excuse me?
You come with me.
Miss Mable will take you on a guided tour to Sin City.
Oh, God.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Somebody?
Who wants to go to Vancouver?
Mom says that we should be polite.
Now, kids, I know you' re disappointed about your father...... but you' re going to have fun.
Aren' t you?
Yes, Miss Mable.
Yes, Miss Mable.
Hey, did you bring us a gift?
Yeah, Mom' s man friends always bring us presents.
Oh, of course.
What kind of guy you think I am?
Uncle Nick loves kids.
As a matter of fact...
Look, look, look.
Dr. Munchies pizza coupon.
You get a free liter of soda with any purchase of a large pepperoni.
What' s a liter?
Oh, yeah, and for you...
Look at that.
Corkscrew.
Cool.
Hey, it' s got a knife.
You can' t give him that.
Shut up.
Make me.
I don' t make trash.
I bury it.
Well, I' il bury my foot in your Say it.
You' re too scared to say it.
Be quiet, you paranoid dunce.
Chicken.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Hey, wanna learn some Chinese?
Sure.
What you got?
Sensei says, "The first one is always a decoy."
Shotgun!
That' s my seat.
You stop.
They gonna eat you alive.
You' re too ugly to sit in the front seat.
That' s my seat.
Watch the paint.
Okay, now, once we get in this terminal...... l want everybody sticking together.
Now, be careful opening that door.
What did?
Sorry, Nick.
Oh, damn!
Boy, didn' t you hear what I just said?
You swore.
You damn right I swore.
That' s about $400 worth of damage to my new car.
That' s twice.
Now you have to put $2 in the swear jar.
Yeah, well, he gotta put about $400 in my pocket.
You got $400 for me?
No.
And I want it cash.
Okay, man, no tears, all right?
I won' t change diapers out here.
Real good.
Have you ever thought of being a youth pastor or a therapist?
Look, it ain' t like I said I was gonna take off my belt.
He' s gonna beat me, Lindsey!
Save me!
Hey, man.
Don' t touch me!
Little dude.
Kevin.
Come here.
Get away!
ls there a problem here, sir?
Just a little game I' m playing with the kids.
Boy, bring your butt back here!
Kevin.
Look.
Look, look.
Look, I got money.
Check it out.
Will that shut you up, huh?
Ten bucks.
Come on.
That' s right.
Hey, you can' t buy us off.
Apologize.
No, no.
We' re cool.
Yeah.
We cool, little mama.
Plus, there' s enough to go around.
Got a tenspot for you too.
I do believe I' m older than him.
I can' t believe I' m getting hustled by a couple of gangsters.
Here.
Now, hurry up.
We can' t be late.
When we go through, they can see our bones and innards?
No, fool, that' s an xray.
Wrong answer.
It' s a metal detector.
Oh, to see if you have any bombs?
You' re not allowed to say "bombs" here.
Why can' t you say "bomb"?
Please remove all metal objects.
Keys, loose change, cell phones, jewelry.
Okay.
Just might take a minute.
I hope you left Nick' s little present in the car, or else you' re going to jail.
Cell phone.
Car keys.
What?
What?
Sir, can you step to the red line, please?
I put everything on the tray.
Please raise your arms and separate your legs.
Corkscrew!
Let' s just get out of here before I end up in Guantánamo Bay.
Our dad would' ve never given him a knife.
Yeah, I' m not your dad.
That' s for sure.
Pick it up.
It' s actually gonna work out better because trains are more fun.
Do you got any snacks?
You mean candy?
No way.
I have to pee.
Can' t you wait till we get on the train?
It' s right there.
I don' t think I can wait that long.
Yes, you can.
Come on.
He' s prone to bladder infections, you know.
All right, man, go do your business.
Aren' t you coming in with me?
Yeah, but I' m not touching nothing.
All aboard!
Come on, come on.
I' m coming.
Wait.
My shoe' s untied.
All clear.
Hurry up.
Other loop.
You know what?
Let me do it.
Let me do it.
No!
Pull from the first loop.
Otherwise it' s too tight at the top.
Okay, okay.
The boy has problems.
He won' t eat anything orange, steamed or poached.
And what he does eat, they can' t touch.
Okay, there you go.
Do it again.
That doesn' t feel right.
His socks can' t have elastic in them.
And he won' t use a toothbrush more than five days.
Shut up!
Make me.
Who' d wanna make another one?
Come on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where' s Galaktico' s cape?
Kevin.
Final boarding call for Vancouver passengers...... departing from track two.
Look, it' s damp.
Kevin!
Lindsey!
Hey!
Lindsey!
The train' s moving.
Out my way.
Yo!
What are you doing?
Sorry, lady.
What' s he doing?
I think he wants us to jump onto a moving train.
Kevin!
Lindsey!
Get up here!
Come on!
Hey, what are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Jump!
Come on!
Mama.
Hey, Nick, how' s the train ride going?
Well, we haven' t exactly left yet.
We decided to drive.
It should be much more educational.
Oh, no, Nick, I cannot let you do that.
That' s way too much trouble.
No, no.
It' il only take a few more hours...... and gives me a chance to get to know Kevin and Lindsey.
I' m really impressed.
You' re very sweet.
Yes, I am.
You sound like you have everything under control.
Can I talk to the kids?
Oh, okay.
Look, don' t tell them nothing that happened, okay?
He lost our luggage.
What?
Are you guys dating?
No.
No.
Let me talk.
We wanna go to Dad' s.
You cannot go to Dad' s now.
You' re going with Nick.
Why?
Dad' s house is in the same direction.
Nick could drop us off there on his way not to date you.
Honey, your dad is sick and in bed.
Now, if you want me to...... l can just quit my job, and we' il go live in a cardboard box.
Whatever.
Let him drive.
Be nice.
l love you.
Love you too.
Bye.
Now, look, driving you two gremlins on New Year' s Eve...... for over 300 miles was never on the agenda.
Okay?
We just drove across town, and y' all done messed up my door.
So now I got to lay down some rules.
Rule number
Rule number one:
Don' t touch the climate control.
Rule number two:
Don' t kick the seat.
Rule number three:
Don' t play with toys.
Can I play with my pizza coupon?
No sassing me.
No eating in the car, no drinking in the car and no smoking.
I don' t smoke.
Good.
Don' t start on my watch.
I don' t want you to touch the radio.
I don' t even want you to sniff the newcar smell.
I want you to sit down on that protective plastic...... and be seen, not heard.
You know, if you' re thinking about my mom, you' re wasting your time.
I' m not wasting my time, because me and your mom, we' re just friends.
That' s good, because Mom' s still into Dad, and he' s totally into her.
They' re getting back together.
I' m happy for them.
Or maybe you guys should go out.
A couple of dates with you would really make her appreciate Dad.
Let' s go.
Have a taste of my steel, zombie.
Yes!
That game doesn' t sound Grated.
Yeah, but it' s keeping him occupied.
The boy played Lady PacMan at the mall and had nightmares for a week.
Give it here, Kevin.
Hey, give it!
Give it to me.
What did I say?
It' s not yours!
Give it here now!
You' re not the boss of me!
Cut it out.
Why don' t we call Mom and see what she has to say.
Fine.
You win.
Snitch.
Baby.
Big baby.
Bigger baby.
Giant baby.
Enormous baby.
Humongous baby.
Colossal baby.
Am not.
Are too.
Am not.
Are too.
Okay, okay.
You' re both acting like a couple of babies.
Come on.
That' s right.
Drink your juice, baby.
Hey, no food in the car.
It' s not food.
It' s juice.
Same difference.
Mine.
Man, see?
Oh, y' all think that' s funny, don' t you?
It' s not funny.
No.
One thing you gotta know here, we keep it real.
You can believe that.
Yuck!
Noisy.
What is that?
50 Cent.
Well, I' il pay him a dollar just to shut up.
Do you have any Justin Timberlake or Clay Aiken?
Lord, these kids are ethnically challenged.
Do you know you can get shot...... by playing those CDs in my old neighborhood?
We' re not ghetto.
Or trying to be ghetto fabulous.
We' re just fabulous.
About time.
Open road.
Vancouver, here we come.
Yeah.
I have to pee.
What?
No, no, you do not have to pee.
Didn' t you go at the train station?
I tried to go, but there was a man standing next to me...... so it just went away.
But look, man, all this open road.
You can hold it.
I know you can.
Cross your legs.
You should' ve asked before we left.
I did.
No, you asked before we got on the train, not before we left the station.
You' re supposed to ask before every segment.
Everyone knows that.
Evidently not.
I' m not gonna make it.
Do you have a bottle?
No.
How about this ashtray?
Kevin, there' s no receptacle in this vehicle.
Now, look, the exit is about a mile away, and you can hold it.
How far is a mile?
I don' t know, 5000 and some kind of feet.
Look, think of something else.
Football, a math test...... puberty.
Are we there yet?
No.
I' m sure the carpet is absorbent.
Oh, here it comes!
For God' s sakes, man, he' s gonna make his water in your car!
No, he ain' t.
lncoming! lncoming! lncoming!
Hold it, man.
Oh, no.
Look, right here.
Yeah.
ln here, in here.
Hold it, hold it.
This is taken!
I' m sorry!
Oh, it' s dribbling out.
Okay, go, go.
Just go.
That' s disgusting!
Hey, wait a minute.
Hold up.
Bought us some groceries for later.
Your mama said you liked fruit.
Garlic olives?
Hey, it' s a truck stop.
That' s all they had.
You see this?
Because of you guys, I gotta do this right here.
You squeezed it, not me.
It' s not coming out.
Hit that green button for me, please.
Hey.
What' s up, man?
How' s it going with those stupid brats you got with you?
Remember this:
If the kids hate you, the mama won' t date you.
Where' d you go?
What, are you in a tunnel?
Are you?
Hello?
All right.
Seat belts.
Nobody gotta go to the bathroom, right?
Okay, here we go.
Nick, we already know about you and Mom.
You do?
Of course.
She talks about you all the time.
Yeah, Mom' s into you.
She says you' re better looking than Taye Diggs.
Oh, yeah?
I am, huh?
Oh, sure.
ln fact, she told me
My gosh.
Get his inhaler.
He' s having an asthma attack.
What?
Where is it?
It' s in the back.
Hurry up!
Go!
All right, I' m going.
Good one, Lindsey.
Very funny.
Open up.
I knew you were lying.
"We' re just friends." You' re just using us to suck up to our mama.
What?
Yeah.
You' re just a dirty, horny sex man like all the others.
Nasty man.
You' re a nasty, bad man.
Look...... l tried to do your mama a favor, you booger.
You probably wanna kiss her, don' t you?
Off the glass.
Off the glass.
And you, open this door.
You forgot the magic word.
Open this damn door.
You just swore again.
Lindsey, he just swore again.
So what?
Hey, I' m not playing with you.
You can' t make us do anything.
Hey, this is my car!
You hear me, little girl?
This is my car!
You better not.
Look at me.
I' m serious.
I' m not playing with you, little girl, okay?
lf you don' t open up before I count to three...... somebody gonna get it.
One.
Two.
Three.
No!
No!
Hey, you stop that car!
Where did he go?
Go!
Floor it!
Hey!
Stop!
Wait a minute!
I don' t have any insurance on you, girl!
Watch what you' re doing!
Watch the spinners!
You' re messing up my spinners!
You know how much they cost?
You can' t catch us.
No!
You little Give me them keys!
Dirty sex man.
What y' all think you' re doing?
Let go of my hat!
Give me them keys!
Hey, Lindsey, stop this crazy thing!
That man' s setting a bad example for them kids.
Wait a minute!
Go!
Now that' s frontier justice.
Hey, turn up the rear heat.
Yeah.
No.
No heat.
No talking.
You' re lucky I' m letting you live.
But But my butt.
I should pull off on the side of the road...... dig a hole, and bury both you two.
That' s what I should do.
Yeah.
Wouldn' t like that.
Can' t believe you two.
Are you crazy?
We have rights.
No, no, you have no rights.
This is my ship, buddy.
I' m the CEO of this SUV.
Believe that.
Breaker, breaker, 26, this is Big Al out on Highway 5, mile marker 1 6.
I got two little lambs here been snatched up by the big, bad wolf.
I need some backup, pronto.
Tenfour, Big Al.
Let' s squash this bug.
You had no consideration for my life, your life or my spinners.
What?
What do you want?
I' m driving here!
Mister lnaHurry. ldiot.
Why is he slowing down?
I don' t like this.
Pull over right now.
Pull it over.
Pull it over.
You better do what he says.
Like hell I will.
I' ve seen those vigilante trucker movies.
I said, pull over!
What you doing?
Oh, no!
My paint!
You think you got me boxed in?
Well, you can kiss my 330 cubic inches of V8 power, sucker!
Hold on.
Help!
No!
No!
No!
What was Mom thinking?
I don' t know.
I like him.
He' s kind of funny.
Hey, don' t get soft.
This man is not our daddy.
He' s the enemy.
Take me now!
Take me now!
This is why we don' t come to the city.
Come on.
Go!
Come on, fleabag.
No way!
What?
Now, get your narrow butts on this horse now!
Hey, how you doing, baby?
Hi. ls everything okay?
Oh, yeah, everything is cool.
Can I call you right back?
Wait, what' s that sound?
You sound very jiggly.
Must be your phone.
Everything' s cool on this end.
Are you gonna be here soon?
Kind of.
Let me call you back in 1 0 minutes.
Wait, wait, I wanna say hi to the kids.
Oh, okay.
She wanna talk to you guys and make sure everything is all right.
Hi, Mom.
Hey.
Hi, babies.
How are you doing?
Come on.
Hit the turbo!
Let' s go!
Let' s go!
I know, baby, but just try to make the best of it, okay?
I love you.
Love you too.
Bye.
Scoot over, I' m coming aboard.
That' s a bad idea.
Says who?
Says the guy...... who put all that junk there.
Oh, snap!
I hate horses.
What take so long?
I have to hang mirror ball.
You little snottynosed runts.
I know exactly where you are.
You messing with Nick the Quick, baby.
Now' s your chance.
Hit yourself over the head with a brick...... and say that they were kidnapped.
Shut up.
Happy New Year.
You think Nick' s okay?
What are you worried about him for?
I' m not.
It' s just...... maybe we were a little rough.
Oh, please.
That player got what he deserved.
"Get your butts on this horse."
"You got $400?"
I' ve been thinking.
We should' ve brought soup or something.
What for?
Because Dad' s sick.
What is he gonna eat?
He' s a dad.
I' m sure he has soup.
He must be lonely, living all by himself.
Look, don' t bug him about that.
lf we want him to hook up with Mom, we have to be subtle.
Got it?
I got it.
Come on, y' all.
Let' s get out of here.
Want some chocolate cake?
It' s worldfamous.
Mom says I shouldn' t have sugar.
What about you?
It' il make your mouth all chocolatey.
No, thanks.
You forgot something.
Sorry about what happened today.
I really wish you guys didn' t have to see that.
He used to look at me like that.
I know, man.
And when he hugged you, you thought he' d never let you go.
They make you laugh, they tell you they love you...... then one day, they never come back.
I bet you know all about leaving, don' t you, player?
Know what?
As a matter of fact, I do.
But only because the same thing happened to me when I was your age.
Yeah, my pops walked out on us too.
It' s a shame that anybody can call theyself a father.
But listen...... he' s the failure in this, not you.
He' s the one that' s gonna miss out.
I just hope it don' t take you guys as long as it took me to figure that out...... because it' s true.
You guys are some cool kids.
There you go.
Come on, let' s get out of here.
Nick?
What' s up, little man?
lf my dad left and your dad left...... does that mean I' il end up like you?
I ain' t doing too bad.
Look, I have blingage.
That' s not exactly what I meant.
l was watching Oprah, and it was all about how depressed and lonely...... bachelors like you are.
But I' m not depressed or lonely.
Yes, you are.
No, I' m not.
Yes, you are.
No, I' m not.
Mom says that if a man is not married by the time he' s 35...... he' s either damaged or gay.
What?
Well, that would explain those earrings.
Watch it, sucker.
But you do have intimacy issues, don' t you?
No, I don' t.
Yes, you do.
No, I don' t.
Yes, you do.
Look, it' s obvious you need a timeout...... and you need a little tickle time.
Because all you do is ask a thousand questions, huh?
Are you all right?
Kevin.
I' m good.
You sure?
Yeah, except...... l' m out.
Okay, don' t worry about that.
We' il get you more once we get there.
Oh, sure, we can wait...... if you want me to die!
They' re closing!
Do something, Nick.
No, no, wait.
Hold on!
Wait a minute.
We need a refill.
Sorry, we' re closed.
Come back Tuesday.
But I got a sick kid here.
Look, I couldn' t help you even if I wanted to.
The pharmacist has left for the holiday.
Well, where is he?
He' s off duty.
And I doubt very much he' s gonna want some guy interrupting his holi
Just a second, sir, and I' il draw you up a map.
Hey, Nick, that guy was such a meanie.
How' d you get him to do what you wanted?
Oh, that was simple.
I just gave him the look.
It works every time.
It even worked through glass?
Oh, yeah.
The look is something I developed when I was a kid.
I had somewhat of a reputation.
Surprise, surprise.
I don' t want everybody stepping to me, so I give them the look...... which told them, "Back off.
That' s a bad mother "" Shut your mouth. "
I wish I could do that.
You got somebody bothering you at school?
An asthmatic in the accelerated program?
What do you think?
Try this.
It' s foolproof.
No, no, check the lip, check the lip.
Man, do not take my lunch money.
Here we go, killer.
Come on.
Hey, hey, where y' all going?
Excuse me, I' m looking for the pharmacist.
Delwyn?
Sure.
He' s...
He' s right over there.
That' s enough.
I got it.
Give me that.
Stop clowning around now.
Give me my shoe.
Excuse me, are you the pharmacist?
Not at the moment.
Why?
He' s got asthma real bad.
Try some steam.
That usually helps.
Knock it off.
Steam?
That' s enough of that.
Look, look, all I need is a refill, okay?
And I know you can help.
I' m asking you nice.
Mister, I' ve been married for 38 years.
You can' t scare me.
Come on, man, you the pharmacist.
I know you took a oath or something.
Not that I can remember, no.
Hey, will you go over there and behave yourself?
Yeah, go get him over there.
You know, folks around here like to barter.
You get what you want, I get what I want.
One hand washes the other.
I scratch your back
Get to the point.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you can' t clown me.
Watch the kids.
All of them?
You little
Oh, my word.
Pie and cake and brownies and pie.
You said "pie" twice.
I like pie.
Kevin, you know Mom would be upset...... if we were even thinking about trying any of these...... chocolatey...... creamy...... delicious...
Hey, I was gonna eat those brownies.
What?
Just take those.
No, I want yours.
Take it easy, man.
Sorry.
Ridiculous.
What?
I got this.
All right, timeout.
Get off of him.
Get off of him.
Get out of here.
Get off of him, you little gangsters.
Watch out.
You too!
Off of him!
What is wrong with you kids?
Why y' all ganging up on him?
You think you so tough?
I' d like to see you try that with somebody my size.
Okay, man!
All right, get off me, you little maggots!
Do you think we should help him?
Hey!
Hey, that' s it.
Now, I' m gonna count to three.
Hey, wait a minute!
Okay!
Get off!
My shoe!
Come back here with my shoe.
All right, people, it' s time for some karaoke.
What is she doing?
She can sing?
She can sing.
Kevin, enough.
Kevin, please.
I didn' t know you could sing that good.
Why you didn' t say nothing?
Because before, you were the enemy.
You know who can sing?
Galaktico can sing.
Okay.
All right, okay, okay.
Put that down, settle down and put on your seat belt.
I know why your mama won' t let you have sugar.
Hyper down.
You' re like some kind of crazy dog.
I know you are, but what am I, Rover?
Nick, I don' t feel so good.
Do you got anything to drink?
There you go.
I' m sorry, Nick, I accidentally spilled a drop on the floor.
Little man, don' t even worry about it.
There' s nothing more that you can do to this car.
Oh, no!
I can' t see.
I can' t see!
ls everybody all right?
I feel much better now.
Nick, where are my kids?
You were supposed to be here two hours ago.
We had a slight delay at the border.
We' re gonna need more paper towels.
Paper towels?
What' s going on?
Nothing.
We just pulled over to clean out the Navigator.
Are you kidding me?
It' s freezing outside, and you' ve got my kids cleaning your precious car?
Suzanne, it' s not like it seems, okay?
Well, it sounds pretty bad from here.
Nick, if you' re not here by 8: 00, you' re gonna be in big trouble.
Suzanne, I got this.
Eight o' clock, Nick.
All right, guys, we gotta hustle.
Your mom' s getting worried.
But it stinks in here.
Hold your breath.
What?
lf we don' t move...... maybe it won' t kill us.
Oh, man, you' re scared of that deer?
He ain' t gonna hurt you.
They come out of the woods when they get cold.
He' s probably hungry.
Try this.
Look what I got.
Nick, deers are herbivores.
So what?
Everybody loves chocolate chip.
Hey, buddy, come on.
Cookie.
Okay, okay, hey, hey, come on.
No.
What?
He' s not gonna hurt you.
Look, I' m right here with you.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Slow.
Come on.
Slowly.
Don' t scare it.
Get in there.
Come on, come on.
There we go.
See, he' s gentle.
He' s not gonna hurt you.
Give him another.
No way.
Where' s my camera?
Down, boy.
Sit.
Hey, Bambi.
Sit!
Bambi.
Give him the look, Nick!
Give him the look!
All right, you want a piece of me?
Say uncle.
Are you done?
Your head gotta go over my fireplace?
Show him who' s boss, Nick.
Now, just let it go.
Let it go.
Now, get your tail out of here before I kick some deer butt.
You better run.
I hope you got some nice shots.
Yep.
Now help me find my keys.
Come on out of there.
lf your mama ever asks...... don' t let her know I know how to hotwire a car.
But you don' t know how to do it.
Quiet down out there.
Have patience.
Turn it off, Nick!
All right, calm down.
Hurry up.
It' s loud.
And scary.
This should do it.
Nick, the car' s on fire.
Oh, no.
It' s gonna burn.
Nick, hurry.
Be careful.
Come on, Nick, do it.
Put it out!
Put it out!
It' s gonna burn, Nick!
Hurry!
This could be toxic.
Worthless.
Galaktico!
Kevin, step back.
I got it.
Hey, Nick, don' t forget me.
I' m over here.
I' m on the dashboard, remember?
Don' t let me burn!
I' m a limited edition!
Oh, man.
I never even got to read the manual.
Hit the dirt!
Why?
Oh, no.
This is about a year' s pay.
What did I do?
What did I do?
Why is this happening to me?
It was you two.
lf I didn' t volunteer to babysit you two little demons...... this wouldn' t have never happened, and I' d still have my car.
Go ahead and cry.
I don' t care.
Okay, all right, stop the waterworks.
Oh, come on, come on.
Stop crying.
Stop crying.
It' s not your fault.
It' s not your fault.
No, no.
I just got a little upset, okay?
That' s why you buy insurance.
All right, let' s sit down.
Come on, now.
Right here, right here.
It' s only a car, okay?
We are a lot of trouble.
That' s why our daddy doesn' t wanna be with us.
Look at me.
Don' t say that.
That' s not true.
But we destroyed your Navigator.
That?
Oh, that' s nothing.
That' s just a material object.
It means nothing.
I wouldn' t wanna spend New Year' s with us either.
Who would?
Me.
I would.
But you know what?
Maybe your mother' s right, you know.
Maybe I' m not cut out for this.
I mean, look at you two.
You' re a mess.
I keep losing you, feeding you the wrong stuff.
lf you were goldfish, you' d be dead.
You know, you' re doing okay.
This is just your first day.
Yeah, you have to get experience.
You' il get used to it.
Yeah, and there' s books you can read too.
Thanks.
But you know what?
lf we' re not magically in front of your mother...... in the next 30 minutes or so...... she' il never talk to me again.
Hey, if it' s the bottom of the ninth, and you' re down two runs, do you quit?
No.
You put that ball back on the tee, and you keep swinging.
Well, let' s keep swinging.
Come on.
Let' s go.
Now we gotta figure out how we gonna get to Vancouver.
Hey, look.
I found your keys, Nick.
What?
It' s just my luck.
Let' s get out of here.
Come on, now.
You got one.
Oh, man, thanks.
We' re on our way to Vancouver, and I really, really appreciate this.
I couldn' t leave these kids here on the highway.
That' s why I' m leaving you, you animal!
Wait a minute!
Come back here, you hillbilly!
Come here!
No.
Let
Hey, yo, bring me back my kids!
Stop.
Mister, are you crazy?
Some psycho trucker took my kids.
We gotta catch him.
Well, hop aboard.
I' il help you.
Ernst to the rescue.
Suzanne, they' il be here any minute.
I' m sure they' re fine.
Now, let' s concentrate on the party.
We were completely wrong about Nick.
Yeah, but now we know he' s kind and gentle.
Come on, slim, get me closer.
Get off.
Open up, you jerk.
Nick, save us!
Help!
Stop this truck!
Get off!
You lunatic!
Stop this truck!
Kind and gentle, huh?
Go, man.
I' m moving.
This thing wasn' t built for speed.
Come on, you' re driving like a old lady.
No, no, you watch.
Ernst knows how to drive.
That' s what I' m talking about.
Let us out now.
We wanna go with Nick.
Let us out.
Come on, slim, don' t let him push you around.
Do it.
Dagbernit, I' ve had enough of this.
Come on, slim, they getting away.
It won' t turn over.
I can' t do anything about it.
I' m sorry.
Boy, it' s true.
Never a cop around when you need one.
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Look, it' s Elite Catering.
This is Mom' s party.
Let' s go.
Come on.
I want some cotton candy.
Got you.
Run!
Save yourself!
Wait.
Wait.
At least slow down.
You two are a peck of trouble, you know that?
Wait.
I' m trying to protect you.
You' re going down, sucker.
Get off me.
I' m gonna give you a knuckle sandwich.
Let me at him.
What' s wrong with you two?
He' s a kidnapper!
He' s a kidnapper!
He' s a kidnapper!
He' s a kidnapper!
Let me at him.
Nick, get him!
Police.
Mom!
Lindsey, honey.
Oh, baby, Mommy was so worried about you.
Are you okay?
Yep.
Eight o' clock, just like you said.
Now, where is your brother and that Nick?
I left them by the iceskating rink.
Now, I need to know what' s going on here, and I want the truth.
The truth?
I don' t think there' s time for the truth.
Get him!
I' m the good guy.
Get him.
Get your hands off me, you stinking snowman.
Get your hands off me, you stinking snowman.
Wait a minute.
You don' t understand.
I got permission from his mother to bring him here.
Kevin, tell him.
Kevin!
Let me go.
He needs his inhaler.
Kevin.
Kevin.
Come on, man.
Breathe.
Breathe, breathe.
Come on, breathe.
Kevin.
Kevin.
Don' t you ever scare me like that again.
You hear me?
Don' t you ever do that.
Maybe it won' t be so bad to turn out like you after all.
Kevin!
Mommy.
Oh, Kevin, honey, come here.
I don' t know what Mommy was thinking.
I should' ve come home.
Are you okay?
I' m fine.
He' s fine.
You call this fine?
This is a catastrophe.
No, Suzanne, you don' t understand.
I mean, we Me and the kids Nick, please.
It' s bad enough as it is.
I really wanted to believe in you.
Ma' am, did this man have permission to watch your children?
Yes.
But it was a mistake, and it won' t happen again.
Come on, you guys.
Suzanne, no.
But, Mom
I don' t wanna hear it.
I' m not in the mood to argue.
Let' s go.
Mommy.
Let' s go.
Suzanne.
Nick.
Listen...... l' m sorry for all the trouble.
lf you' re serious about heading home, I' d be proud to give you a lift.
Appreciate that, Big Al.
I got my truck right
Hey, what are you doing, you turkey?
You can' t tow my truck!
I' m here.
Put it down right now.
Officers, arrest this man!
Yo, Nick.
Excuse me.
Hey, Nick, remember me?
I' m in here with a mint stuck to my head.
Hey, brother.
What are you moping about?
You should be celebrating.
You finally got rid of that highfalutin woman...... with that smartmouth little girl and that sickly boy.
Yes, sir.
It' s New Year' s Eve, and you are free at last.
Time to hit some clubs.
And they got some foxy ladies here.
Did you know Vancouver produces more Playmates...... than any other city in the world?
Let' s go, player.
Thanks, Dad, that was a lot of fun.
Hey, Nick.
You know what they call a 50yearold bachelor?
What?
Lonely.
Who is it?
Room service.
We didn' t order anything, and that won' t change.
Let me explain, okay?
I know you' re upset, and you have a right to be...... but there' s a good reason why all Nick, they' re kids.
They don' t need reasons and excuses.
They need a man.
So whatever it is that you have to say, just drop it.
I' ve been down this road before, and I' m not going back.
Good night.
Wait, wait.
Just let me say goodbye to the kids.
I don' t think that' s a good idea.
Please.
Make it quick.
Nick!
Nick!
Hey, how you guys doing?
You all right?
I knew you' d come back.
Lindsey didn' t think so, but I did.
Boy, you know I' m gonna be your friend always, right?
But Mama' s not gonna date you anymore.
Listen, you guys.
Your mother is a very, very wonderful lady.
And she' s gonna be dating guys that are much better than me.
So you guys gotta stop chasing them off, okay?
And stay away from their cars.
Unless they' re bulletproof.
How do I know we' il ever see you again?
I got something for you.
I want you to hold on to my man Satch, okay?
That' s until I see you again.
All right...... l gotta get going.
Do you have to?
Yeah, little man, I think so.
Look, I got one more thing for you.
And for you.
Now you have blingage.
I love you guys.
See you later, okay?
All right.
Suzanne, I' m sorry about what happened today.
I really am.
I just wanna know if we can still be friends.
Nick, I don' t think that' s gonna happen.
Okay.
Nick?
We can' t be friends...... because I wanna be so much more than just your friend.
What?
Come here.
Yes.
Yes.
It' s New Year' s.
Aren' t you supposed to kiss her?
I love a happy ending.
Yeah!
These are concealed from all human beings.
The Forest of Resurrection.
This way.
Better be right.
Just follow me.
Where are they?
Don' t worry, they are coming.
I' m not worried.
I just don' t trust you.
Do as you please then.
It' s a quite a big deal for a pick up, isn' t it.
Where' s the other car?
We gotta wait for him.
Are you serious?
It' s not safe here.
We have specific orders from him.
Look, the roads could be blocked by now.
We gotta go! what' s the matter?
Shut up.
What the hell we doing here anyway?
You shut up.
An order is an order.
Stop whining.
Orders?
Do you know what we had to go through for this?
Besides, this place gives me the cr eeps.
Don' t bother.
These assholes will only follow orders.
What?
Is there any party?
Or you trying to promote hoodlums?
Better watch your mouth.
After all this running around, all we get is a useless bunch of punks.
Forget it.
I see.
So shall I give you a rest?
Forever.
Stop!
We gotta keep him alive.
It' s an order.
Shut up!
I do not get the point why he is so special.
But you have to follow orders, too, right?
Calm down!
Both of you.
Back off.
Don' t be so choosy.
We gonna let you get out of here when he comes, all right?
I hate waiting.
Stop it for now.
Okay,
we' il wait for him.
We better hurry up.
I hate this place.
A forest to the southwest is an ominous feng shui sign.
Oh, really?
To meet with you guys is an ominous enough.
Stop it.
Don' t start again!
Bring the girl.
What' s with this girl?
Just following orders.
One girl and one asshole.
What good are they?
What the hell is he doing?
Come on, he should have some plan.
Hey wait.
I' m taking no part in kidnapping.
What?
5 men on one girl, you must be proud of yourself.
Hey, let her go and take off your wig.
Shut the fuck up!
Do you know who you' re talking to?
We are the ones set you free from the jail where you belonged.
I' m a feminist.
So, what you gonna do?
I said let her go.
Watch it.
Just let her go.
Are you crazy or what?
Don' t let me tell you again.
This would be your last chance.
What now, tough guy?
Where did they go?
This place is wrong.
I' il kill him.
Better not.
He' il become a monster, too.
I don' t get it...
Oh Yes.
I can kill him twice.
Nonsense.
Let' s get out of here.
No, we' il go after them!
You don' t understand.
Look, this is your fault...
It' s not just that.
Think about it.
Thinking isn' t going to do a bit of good.
Nonsense.
They were not dead.
Let' s get them before he gets here.
Yeah, you' re right.
You didn' t have to kill him! what' s your problem?
You' re no different from those men.
They' re bastards, I' m not.
I' m sorry...
Thanks for helping me.
I didn' t mean to help you.
They just piss me off.
What are we gonna do?
Didn' t you have any plans?
Plans are always changed.
Great.
They' re going to kill us.
They were...
Surely dead.
Hey.
Why were you in jail...?
Shut up.
Something' s not right with this place.
About what?
People are everywhere... but it' s too quiet.
Nobody' s here.
I feel them.
What makes you feel that?
I have a strong sixth sense...
wait.
what' s wrong with you?
Where the fuck you think you are going?
Stay back.
This man...
What are you doing?
Stop!
Let him rest in peace!
I don' t believe this...
You' re crazy.
Let' s go.
We' il take their car.
Stop it!
Let' s get out of here.
They must be around here.
Something' s wrong here.
Again?
I can feel it!
They were...
Something is wrong!
Hey...
What?
They were dead... and they came back to life.
So what?
The dead could be back to life here.
So what?
We' ve been here over and over...
We always buried the ones we killed...
Dead bodies are everywhere...
Where the fuck are they?
No, I didn' t mean to...
Come!
Let go of me!
Game is over.
What are those monsters?
Who knows, they are your playmates.
Then you die, and play with me!
Remember your orders!
Don' t kill him!
Hey, you got wrong man.
Just let him go.
Don' t be a fool, punk.
This is complicated.
Hey, she' s been taken away.
What?
That runt shot my arm and took the girl.
Jesus, the both of you!
You' re both crazy!
You turning back?
Well, I' il play with you later.
OK?
Good job shithead, now he' s gone.
Don' t you get it?
I let him find the girl for us.
We' il get them both after he finds her.
Pretty smart...
Orders are to get both of them alive.
Oh... too bad.
It doesn' t matter anymore.
You...
I' il be in charge from now on and he will die.
What?
It' s all been planned.
He comes here to be killed.
Don' t fool with me!
What the fuck?
Die slowly.
W e don' t want you back alive.
Are you okay?
But this place is fucked up.
Nothing can stop me...
Not even those monsters.
Don' t worry.
Hurry up!
Bastards...
Ouch!
You okay?
Shit...
Your hand!
He took it...
That bastard!
Damn it!
W e' il make them pay for this.
Shouldn' t we report back?
No...
We' il search for them... and destroy them!
But where are they?
I know what they' re thinking.
They took the mountain paths.
I was trained at FBl HQ at Langley.
I' m an expert in profiling.
An expert?...
Expert, so where in the mountains?
Don' t worry.
I' il track them down.
I grew up in Yellow Stone National park, a natural born hunter!
A hunter?
Which way?
No!
Shut the fuck up!
What' s wrong here...
He' il come after us.
Let me go!
This is so insane.
You did all this?
It' s all your fault!
Stop...
You' re crazy...
Hey.
No!
What?
You don' t have to kill him.
Shut up.
Don' t preach at me.
You can' t hurt people for no reason.
A lot of people are better dead.
That' s not for you to judge.
What are you?
A preacher?
Let' s go.
Look, no more killing, okay!
We' ve been waiting.
Finally...
This is going to end soon.
My gun.
Who are you?
How did you get here?
I was kidnapped...
What?
I can' t remember.
I can' t remember anything what happened before I got here.
Yeah, right.
How about you?
What got you in prison?
I was...
What?
You don' t remember either?
I forget things easily.
You too.
When did you get here?
Now.
What' s going on?
What are those monsters... those two weirdos?
What are you up to?
Something bad.
Where are others?
Where?
They' re all dead.
and why are you alive?
Gotta problem?
Y eah.
You.
A scumbag like you should be dead.
Oooh, who are these scary people?
You' re dead.
No, let' s get away from here.
That was pretty good.
But not good enough...
Hey, babe.
What are you?
You' il need an army to kill me.
You.
I' il give you power...
in death.
Him!
No, we have to go!
No, not him!
Let' s go!
Now!
Hurts?
Human life is only an instant.
Your body will eventually rot.
Do you wanna be dead?
or wanna have eternal life?
Eternal...
Any trouble?
Y es, a little accident.
Are you okay officer?
Don' t call me officer.
Did you do it again?
You better behave yourself, officer...
You want to fight me, the master of all martial arts?
The Fighter!
Okay, Fighter.
Fighter?
We don' t hav e time.
Let' s kill them!
Right, Fighter.
Your heart!
Here.
Help yourself.
What?
Mother fucker!!!
I' il show you the world beyond death...
Come on.
Let' s go.
Why?
We have to hurry.
No.
I never turn my back.
We don' t have time for this.
That man is dangerous...
Who is he?
You know him.
He' s...
That' s enough.
Who is he?
Work a little more on B and C
Well done, Ash
Still as good as ever
Charge me for one clip of 7. 62mm...... and two clips of PPK
Two or three more 'completes' and you go to the next level
You' il have a time handicap
You know that, don' t you?
I' il take the rest of my point in cash
Solo gets more dangerous the further you go
Are you sure you don' t want to join another party?
Good game, Ash
Great tactics!
Just like Ash!
And surer
Move!
Ash...
The circuits aren' t clear yet
Even you have to wait your turn
I' il cancel, then
I can' t
Do me a favor
I can' t accept requests from individual players
It wouldn' t be fair
You know that
I want data on that 'Bishop' who just cleared Class A
You can at least tell me more than the terminal did
Why are you interested?
He' s challenging me
But you never make contact with another player
Isn' t that your philosophy?
"Avalon...... faraway isle of legend...... of apple groves... and mist...
Avalon...
When will that day come?
Avalon...
Isle of faery...... where heroes go...
avalon...
A hero takes ship...... and sets sail...... to that isle of legend...
Avalon...
To the Nine Sisters...... and Avalon...
There together...... on that holy isle
O Arthur...... your ship sets sail...... over the misty water to Avalon "
It' s you...
You' re looking well
I hear all kinds of things
It' s a real drag, you know...
I go to different branches
I hear things...... sometimes things I wish I hadn' t
Maybe it' s karma
I hear that there' s a solo Warrior who' s really good...... and that it' s a woman, too
I started wondering is you
Did you search?
For what?
For my branch
Just dumb luck
But if we ever teamed up again...... it' d be like fate was giving us a second chance
I wish I was a Warrior
Then I could play solo
But who ever heard of...... a solo Thief?
W scout, we spring traps...
We' re like river pilots...... or guides
Any party would be happy to have you, Stunner
It' s been a while since anyone called me that
All of us old Wizard members are still angry at each other
All the other players...... resent us, too
People said Wizard was the toughest party of all
But instead of that making my career...... it' s a handicap
Wizard was...
I don' t want to hear
I guess not
That was then
I don' t have time to rehash the old days
Ash...
I don' t need thanks
That' s not it
What about Murphy?
Maybe you haven' t heard...
Look, if you don' t want this...
He went solo, too
He got lost
You must have heard about it...
A hidden character in Class A?
A weird 'neutral character' who appears when you' re in there
A silent young girl with sad eyes
Some people say she' s just a bug in the program
She' s called 'the ghost'
Whatever she is...... no one who goes after her ever comes back
So you' d think no one would go after her, wouldn' t you?
I' m sure at least you' ve heard the stories... about a phantom field called 'Special A' where you can' t reset to escape
A dangerous field, but you get tons of experience points
They say the ghost is the only gate into that field
So they go after her
Anyone who wants to get into Special A...... chases the ghost
Just like Murphy did
Stunner!
Go around to the right and draw them off!
Copper! Cuisinart! Masher!
Concentrate your fire!
Murphy! We' re running low on ammo!
Let' s pull back!
Stunner, you idiot!
Stop bitching!
'Reset' is not part of the Wizard strategy!
Ash!
Ash!
Here Arthur lies, King once and King to be
AVALON is an illegal game
My ID data?
Come on...
Come on come on come on!
Come on!
Wait at field- class A area "Rulns C66"
Class A' s busy today
Watch for time- lags
Have you heard of 'the Nine Sisters'?
Morgan Le Fay?
Morgan Le Fay?
Yes
One of the nine fairy queens who rule Avalon... the legendary lsle
They lay the dying King Arthur... on a black ship and take hime over the water to Avalon
The fairy Morgan Le Fay...
The Queen North Galys...
The Queen of the Waste Lands... and... his protectress, the Lady of the Lake
There' s a story like that in northern Europe
Odin goes on a journey
His ship is wrecked and he drifts to an island far across the water...
There Morgan rescues him... gives him a gold ring... and grants him immortality and eternal youth
But Odin doesn' t realize... that Morgan has set a crown upon his head
'The Crown of Oblivion'...
He forgets all about his homeland...... and all about the world outside
Begin
Hold it! Don' t shoot!
I' m Jill, of 'The Nine Sisters'
It' s a pleasure to meet the famous' Ash '
It' s a pleasure
Welcome, Ash
Thanks for accessing
What do you want?
I don' t expect data for free
You don' t waste time
Maybe we' il take your gear, then
Lots of people would pay cash for your equipment data
Selling that data' s against the rules
There are lots of ways to make a living in Avalon
Tell me about 'Special A'
You mean it?
All I know is what I' ve heard
Only the real Nine Sisters would know
If not them...
Who are the real 'Nine Sisters'?
They' re the ones who programmed this game
Murphy!
Those bastards!
A time- lag!
Sorry I messed up the room
Don' t worry
Everyone has days like that
The Legend of King Arthur
The Chronicles of King Arthur
The story of King Arthur
A Kaleidoscope of Arthurian Legend
Ash... you look a bit pale
Feeling the effects of reset?
Don' t get mad about the gate that lets you into Special A...
You want to know how you meet the ghost?
have you had breakfast?
You should eat sometimes
I heard this from... a party that lost a few people
They say that every time the ghost appears there' s always a Bishop there
It' s the one common link
A Bishop?
A Bishop' s there every time a party sees the ghost
As long as you have a Bishop, you see the ghost?
Not only that
Some fools set themselves up with any old Bishop...... and go 'ghost hunting'
That' s not how you do it
What level?
Good question
He has to be Class A- complete
An Archbishop, above Level 12
That' s the condition.
No mistake
So?
Are you going to switch from 'Warrior'...... to 'Bishop'?
Alone?
Murphy was solo
A Level- 12 Bishop...
Hey... what level are you?
13?
But to switch to 'Bishop'... you need double the experience points
Look at Murphy
You know how long it took him... to make Bishop
It takes time and money...
You can' t do it without a party to back you up
I couldn' t do it
You could with a party
But with your record, who' s going to link up with you?
And...... very, very few people make Archbishop
No, Ash... you probably couldn' t do it
Maybe if Murphy were here...
Thanks
Be seeing you
How did you find me?
Seek and ye shall find
Anyway, I think it' s me that you need
Real meat... real vegetables... rice...
Yours is a lucky dog
He eats better than people do
Real alcohol... cigarettes...
wisdom you can' t get from a terminal
All the fruits of Avalon... the privilege of a solo player
But for the best players, the game becomes its own reward
I' ve checked you out
Stunner?
The ability to analyze data... is one of a Bishop' s
Most important skills
You were a Warrior in Wizard
When it dissolved, many people speculated as to why
The details remain a mystery... but there are those who say... a certain Warrior ignored her orders... and called 'reset'
Ash! Can you hear me?
Shoot at the cockpit!
What' s wrong, Ash?
Answer me?
Someone gets scared... the party losses its point person and gets wiped out
Happens all the time
The only strange thing... was that it happened to the invincible Wizard
I want to form a party with you
The standard six members
Three Warriors, a good thief...... and a Mage, if possible
Is that all?
You' re not going to ask about me?
Would you tell me?
Inside Avalon I will
Be in Flak Tower 22...
I' d like to close
I' m meeting someone at midnight who can take me to Class Special A
There' s no such thing, you know
Not inside Avalon
No matter how real it seems,
Avalon is just a game
But a program you can' t clear... isn' t a game any more
That' s why it' s hidden away... a forbidden field
Who are you?
Bishop scouted me, too
As a terminal manager, not as a player
Who is' Bishop '?
It' s no use trying to track him down
He doesn' t access from a branch
He has his own terminal
He just shows up in the game
Can you do that?
Sure you can and equipment, it' s no problem
With enough money
Keep away from him
I can' t
Why not?
Murphy' s in Special A
So that' s it...
Take Room 9.
The Game Master' s waiting
Thanks
I' ve input your coordinates
I' d prefer you didn' t go to Special A, though...
I' m sorry
A good game master... does not intervene
Let me ask you something...
Are you accessing from a terminal somewhere... or are you part of the system itself?
What does it matter?
You couldn' t confirm that anyway
All right
Begin
Area "Flak Tower22"
Thanks for your help
Don' t thank me.
This team was necessary
Did you find out about me?
You' re one of the Nine Sisters, rulers of Avalon...... designers of the program
I' m a Bishop
A successor to the Apostles
I' m not responsible for its creation
But, you' re not a player.
You' re on their side
Would you like to be?
I don' t trust myself to join them
There' s no need to join their party
They' re just ciphers
Nothing but a mass of data
Ash...
You know which is the better game:
One you think you can clear but can' t... or one that looks impossible but isn' t...
Finding that subtle balance... and maintaining it up through all the levels... is our side' s job
Right
It looks like we' re all here
Let' s move out
Nice to be working with you again
Field- class A "Ruins D99"
No response from up ahead
I don' t like it...
Ash... go up top
Makanito, Zilwan,
Badi... forward
Shit!
It' s a bloody citadel!
Of all the goddamn luck!
Settle down
It' s a Class A- strength opponent, but it has a weak point
The cannons will get us if we attack head- on...
Ash... we' il get out in front and stop it
You get behind it and aim at the grill
Damn it, Bishop!
Are you trying to wipe out your front line?
They' re just dummies created by the program!
Forget them!
Move! Don' t wait around!
Where are you, ghost?
Stunner!
I screwed up again...
And this chance never comes twice...
I' m just not very lucky
Again?
You saw her
The ghost...
Your chance comes when she leaves the wall
Get the ghost... and you open the gate to Special A
Say hello to Murphy
It wasn' t your fault that Wizard got wiped out
The one who ran... was me
I wanted to tell Murphy that
Ash!
Hurry
The ghost won' t wait for you
Welcome to Class Real
Just as I thought... you' re the only one who got through the gate
Is this' Special A '?
We call it 'Class Real'
Building it has taken huge amounts of very sophistricated data
In many ways, it' s still very experimental
'ln many ways'?
There' s just one thing you have to do to complete it
Finish off the Unreturned
Your equipment and skill parameters are...... returned to default
All you have is a pistol...... and one clip of ammunition
There are neutral characters operating under free will
Hurt one of them and your game is over
There' s no time limit
The only exit from the game is completion
If you get back safely...... you can be one of us
Any questions?
Why did you send me here?
Iies within you
We' il begin
Look behind you
He' il be there
Fight well, Ash
Avalon, faraway isle of legend...... of apple groves and mist...
Avalon, when will that day come?
'lsle of faery, where heroes go...'
Why did you come?
Because of me?
Isn' t that a good reason?
You know why Wizard broke up
I thought I did.
That' s why I kept my mouth shut
I let them think I called 'reset'
So why did you come here?
Stunner told me you were lost back there, you' re just another 'Unreturned'
You wanted to go all the way
We were too complacent.
We were in your way
None of us wanted to break up the party
We ere invincible.
Everyone else envied us
All the more reason...... you needed a pretext to dissolve it
But is this what you wanted?
Did you abandon us... to spend your life as a vegetable in a hospital bed?
Do I look like a vegetable to you?
Remember, this is' Class Real '
Reality is nothing but an obsession that takes hold of us
Why shouldn' t I make this into my reality?
You tell yourself that, but all you' re doing is running away
I don' t want to argue!
Have you noticed what color your hair is?
that makes them call you 'Ash'?
Where' s that beautiful silver streak...
Have you ever been shot?
Do you want to feel real pain in a real body?
Does it have to be this way?
When one of us dies... and that body doesn' t vanish...
the other one will know
'so many of the brave are cut down... and heroes lay fallen
As bright, shining death approaches... the spectres appear... and shroud them in darkness... as black night descends... "
Ash...
Don' t let appearance confuse you
This is the world... where you belong
"Avalon, the heroes set out... for that isle of legend...
Avalon, isle of spirits...
Avalon, heaven of shadows...
Now, with the Nine Sistes... across the misty water... the ship sets sail...... to Avalon "
Welcome to Gattaca.
You keep your workstation so clean, Jerome.
- It' s next to godliness, isn' t that what they say?
Not one error in a million keystrokes.
Phenomenal.
It' s right that someone like you is taking us to Titan.
There' s been talk of delay.
You shouldn' t listen to talk.
You leave in a week.
You' ve got a substance test.
Never shy.
Pisses on command.
Have I ever told you that?
- Only every time I' m in here.
I see a great many on the course of any given day.
Yours just happens to be an exceptional example.
I wonder why my folks didn' t order one like that for me?
- By the way, have I ever told you about my son?
- No, you haven' t.
Remind me to, sometime.
So you' re about to go up.
One week left.
Please tell me you' re the least bit excited.
I' il tell you at the end of the week.
Congratulations, Jerome.
Thank you.
How many launches are there in a day?
- Sometimes more.
- You' re the only one that watches every one of them.
If you' re going to pretend like you don' t care, don' t look up.
- on a one- year manned mission to Titan, the 14th moon of Saturn.
A highly prestigious assignment, although for Jerome selection was virtually guaranteed at birth.
He' s blessed with all the gifts required for such an undertaking.
A genetic quotient second to none.
No, there' s truly nothing remarkable about the progress of Jerome Morrow.
Except that I am not Jerome Morrow.
I was conceived in the Riviera.
The Detroit variety.
They used to say that a child conceived in love has a greater chance of happiness.
They don' t say that any more.
- rather than those of her local geneticist.
Ten fingers, ten toes, that' s all that used to matter...
Not now.
Now, only seconds old, the exact time and cause of my death was already known.
Neurological condition, 60% probability, manic depression, 42% probability.
Attention deficit disorder, 89% probability.
Heart disorder...
99% probability.
Early fatal potential.
- Life expectancy:
30. 2 years.
- 30 years?
- The name for the certificate?
- Anton.
- No, Vincent Anton.
That' s a good name.
I know he' il do something.
Chronically ill.
Every skinned knee and runny nose was treated as if it were life threatening.
I' m sorry, the insurance won' t cover it.
- But I was told...
- I really wish there were smth I could do.
Like most other parents of their day, they were determined that their next child -
- will be brought into the world in what has become the natural way.
- have been fertilized with Antonio' s sperm.
After screening, we' re left, as you see, with 2 healthy boys and 2 very healthy girls.
Naturally no critical predispositions to any major inheritable diseases.
All that remains is to select the most compatible candidate.
First, you may want us to decide on a gender.
Have you given it any thought?
We would want Vincent to have a brother, you know, to play with.
Of course you would.
You have specified hazel eyes, dark hair and... fair skin.
- propensity for violence, obesity...
We were just wandering if it' s good to just leave a few things to chance.
We want to give your child the best possible start.
Believe me, we have enough imperfection built- in already.
Your child doesn' t need any additional burdens.
And keep in mind, this child is still you.
Simply the best of you.
You could conceive naturally a 1, 000 times and never get such a result.
That' s how my brother Anton came into the world.
A son my father considered worthy of his name.
- What' d I tell you.
See how much he' s grown?
- I understood that there was smth very different flowing through my veins.
And I' d need an awful lot more than a drop if I was going to get anywhere.
When our parents weren' t watching -
- we used to swim as far out as we dared.
It was about who' d get scared and turn back first.
Come on, you coward!
Of course it was always me.
Anton was by far the stronger swimmer and he had no excuse to fail.
Maybe it was the love of the planets, maybe it was just my growing dislike for this one, -
- but for as long as I can remember I' ve dreamed of going into space.
750 million, 800 million, 850 million.
How many astronauts are there anyway?
I bet I could be one if I wanted.
Hey don' t eat that.
It' s Pluto.
Much to my parents' dismay.
You have to be realistic.
With a heart condition like yours...
- Mom, there' s a chance there' s nothing even wrong about it.
- One chance in a 100.
- Well, I' il take it, allright?
- The trouble is they won' t.
Listen, for God' s sake, you' ve got to understand something.
The only way that you' il see the inside of a spaceship is if you were cleaning it.
My father was right.
It didn' t matter how much I lied on my resumé.
My real resumé was in my cells.
- when there are a 1, 000 other applicants with a far cleaner profile?
Of course, it' s illegal to discriminate.
"Genoism", it' s called.
But no one takes the law seriously.
Even the saliva on your application form.
- an illegal peek at your future in the company.
You' re sure you wanna do this?
You know you' re gonna lose.
Like always, knowing each stroke to the horizon was one we' d have to make back to the shore.
But something was very different about that day.
- he found me right beside him.
Until finally... the impossible happened.
- and I was not as weak.
It was the moment that made everything else possible.
Like many others in my situation -
- I moved around a lot next few years, getting work where I could.
I must' ve cleaned half the toilets in the state.
- no longer determined by social status or the colour of your skin.
- Welcome to Gattaca, gentlemen.
- Now, we now have discrimination downto a science.
Allright, there' s your cleaning material.
Start from the front and clean all the way back.
And I want to see my smiling face on that floor.
What about you, Your Majesty?
Dreaming of space?
Come here.
Start by cleaning this space right here.
- then when I was standing right beside it.
When you clean the glass, Vincent, don' t clean it too well.
What do you mean?
You might get ideas.
- it' il be easier for you to see me when I' m on the other side of it.
I knew it was just that.
- the best test score in the world wasn' t gonna matter unless I had a blood test to go with it.
I' ve made up my mind to resort to more extreme measures.
The man who showed up at my doorstep didn' t exactly advertise in the Yellow Pages.
Stand straight.
- How did you hear about me?
Any distinguishing marks?
Tattoos, scars, birth marks?
I don' t think so.
Are you serious about this?
I hope you' re not wasting my time.
- I' d give 100%.
- That' il get you halfway there.
That' s an old edition, but I know it all by heart.
- You realise the commitment is binding.
- You have somebody in mind?
For the genetically superior, success is easier to attain, but is by no means not guaranteed.
After all, there is no gene for fate.
- their genetic identity becomes a valued commodity for the unscrupulous.
One man' s loss is another' s gain.
His credentials are impeccable.
An expiration date you wouldn' t believe.
The guy' s practically gonna live forever.
He' s got an IQ off the register.
Better than 20/ 20 in both eyes.
And the heart of an ox.
He could run through a wall.
If he could still run.
Actually, he was a big- time swimming star.
Vincent, you could go anywhere with this guy' s DNA tucked under your arm.
- What did I tell you, you look so right together I wanna double my fee.
It' s close enough.
When was the last time anybody looked at your photograph?
You could have my face on your name tag, for Christ 'sake.
- But how do I explain the accident?
- That' s the beautiful thing, it happened out of the country.
There' s no record he ever broke his back.
As far as anybody' s concerned, he' s still a walkin 'talkin' fully productive member of society.
- You just have to get him clean, fill in the last year of his life.
- You' re a foreigner.
Just how.
Blood has no nationality.
As long as it' s got what they' re looking for, it' s the only passport you' il need.
- Who lives up there?
- Well, I certainly don' t.
So began the process of becoming Jerome.
Myopia is one of the most obvious signs of a disadvantaged birth.
- Isn' t there any other way?
- Surgery is no good, they' il see the scars.
It' s contact lenses or a white cane.
- He' s right.
My eyes are prettier.
You understand I take 25% of everything you make.
If it for some reason it doesn' t work out, all this equipment must be returned within 7 days.
- Wait, wait!
I thought you said 20%.
- 20%.
- It' s not negotiable.
- I guess that' s it.
- Why, why?
There' s still the matter of the height.
- 4 foot 6.
- How tall were you before the accident?
- Unfortunately, his profile says he' s 6 '1 ".
- So, I can wear lifts.
Even with lifts you' re not that tall.
So what?
- No, we never discussed that.
- Oh, I thought you were serious, Vincent.
I' m not doing that.
I won' t do that.
Jerome never questioned my committment again.
- I' d be exactly two inches closer to the stars.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Do you want to go dancing?
You had to be a right- hander.
No one orders southpaws any more.
Jerome Morrow.
It' s a nice name.
- It' s my name.
- I can' t be you without it.
What makes you think you can be me at all?
Look at this.
- Look at it.
- It' s nice.
- I' m impressed, is it real?
- Are you colour- blind, too, Vincent?
It' s silver.
Jerome Morrow was never meant to be one step down on the podium.
With all I had going for me, I was still second best.
So how do you expect to pull this off?
I don' t know, exactly.
Your signature needs work.
Soon came time to put our preparations to the test.
Jerome had been engineered with everything he needed to get into Gattaca, except the desire to do so.
- Do you really want to be in there?
- I don' t wanna be in there, I wanna be up there.
- What' s up there?
- That' s want I want to find out, Jerome.
Call me Eugene.
My middle name.
If you' re going to be Jerome, you' d better start getting used to it.
Where' s my sample?
- In the refrigerator.
Door on the left.
- Which pouch?
- Oh, any of them.
- You think I should test it?
- If you like.
My God, what' s wrong with the machine?
It' s nothing wrong with the machine.
You' ve been drinking again!
- I haven' t.
- Oh Christ Eugene, it' s 8 o' clock in the morning!
- I haven' t!
This is no joke.
My interview is in an hour!
- There' s more vodka in this piss than there is piss!
- I' m sorry.
I had half a glass to celebrate.
- Try Friday' s, that one will be OK.
- There' s only Wednesday left.
Wednesday.
That' s the one.
Listen, it' s not too late to back out.
This is the last day that you' re gonna be you and I' m gonna be me.
Well?
- Congratulations.
- What about the interview?
That was it.
I got it.
Of course you got it.
And that' s the way it was.
To limit how much of my In- Valid self I' d leave in the valid world.
At the same time, Eugene prepared samples of his own superior body matter so that I might pass for him.
Fingertips blood sachees for security checks and vials filled with other traces.
- and kept him in the style to which he' d become accustomed.
Eugene never suffered from a routine discrimination of a "utero", "faith birth", "In- Valid" as we would call it.
The burden of perfection.
I was now a member of a relatively new and particulary detested segment of society.
One of those that refuses to play the hand that he' s dealt.
Or... a "de- gene- erate".
In the guise of Jerome Morrow I' ve risen quickly for the ranks of Gattaca.
Only one of the mission directors has ever come close to discovering my true identity.
Strange to think, he may have more success exposing me in death than he ever did in life.
- I think we can rule out suicide.
- Excuse me, sir?
- Nothing.
Thank you.
This will take a while.
We may have to push things back.
Irene, I want you to assist the investigators.
- My work, Director, that would put me behind.
- I appreciate your sacrifice, Irene.
- Will you seek to that I don' t lose my place in line?
- Your place is assured.
- Director?
- Thank you, Irene.
- Thank you, Director.
- Director, how will this affect the mission?
- Oh, we' re still going ahead as planned.
Tragic though this event may be, it hasn' t stopped the planets turning.
- What happened?
- I' m going up.
- When?
- End of the week.
- End of the week, that soon?
- What about the mission director?
- He' s dead.
Are you serious?
They found him in his office this morning, beaten so badly they had to check his name tag.
You are serious.
So that' s it, there' s nothing between us and ignition.
I' m going up.
- The man was murdered?
I didn' t do it.
I didn' t say you did but if the man was murdered, the place is gonna be crawling with Hoovers.
I' il take my chances with the J. Edgars over the mission director.
I' m gonna be slightly out of their jurisdiction.
We have to get drunk immediately.
Good evening, gentlemen.
I hear you' re leaving us, Mr. Morrow.
- Looks that way.
- We' re going to miss you.
- You' ve opened the wine, I hope?
- Pour yourself a glass, Cavendish.
- Me?
- The specimen?
- I kissed him five minutes ago.
A real good one.
- I' il see what I can do.
- You want the full sequence?
- Yes.
- Good luck.
- 9. 3.
Quite a catch.
- Yes.
Quite a catch.
God, how many times I' ve told Cavendish...
This' s gotta be open more than five minutes ago!
Remember that.
You know, they say when you' re weightless is the closest thing to being in the womb.
I can' t believe you pulled this off.
They' re sending you up there.
Up there, for Christ sake!
You, of all people.
I hate to think of you alone in that room for a year.
- Well better think about it.
You know what I' m saying.
What are you gonna do?
I have my books.
I go places in my head.
- That' d be help if you had some company.
- I have visitors.
- Yeah well, none that you don' t pay.
- I wouldn' t have it any other way.
- Seriously, what are you going to do?
I' m going to finish this.
What' s Titan like this time of year?
What' s Titan like?
Titan is exactly like this.
All the time, it' s got a cloud around that' s so thick, noone can tell what' s underneath.
- Maybe there' s nothing there.
- There' s something there.
- You should be going, instead of me.
- Why is that?
'cause up there your legs wouldn' t matter.
I' m scared of heights.
I' m sorry.
Do you want this?
I' il save some for you, shall l?
I' m so sorry.
I' m really, really sorry.
Don' t give me a hard time.
- Come on!
Help!
- I' m sorry.
- No, I wasn' t drunk...
- What do you mean you' re not drunk? -... when I walked in front of that car.
- What car?
I stepped right out in front of it.
I' ve never been more sober in my life.
- Go to sleep.
- I couldn' t even get that right, could I?
If at first you don' t succeed, try, try again.
Go to sleep.
I' m proud of you, Vincent.
You must be drunk to call me Vincent.
- How much do you need?
You can go.
It' s all right, Irene.
We found our man.
It' s the only specimen in the entire place that can' t be accounted for.
- Every 10 years or so things go our way.
- The eyelash, what do you know about it?
It' s an unregistered In- Valid.
He was a janitor here untill a few years back, when he dissappeared out of sight.
- What kind of specimen could last so many years since then.
- Well, take a look at the floor.
Sir, I don' t think anything lies a
It' s also the matter of loading.
Is a janitor gonna come back here after all this time to kill a man he never knew?
Well, his profile does suggest a violent temperament.
If I' m not mistaken, his profile also suggests he' s a sick man.
There' s a 90% chance the owner of this eylash has already died himself of natural causes.
It' s a lost and found case, sir.
All we have to do is find the man who' s minus an eylash and we have the murderer.
I' il do a cross- check, I' il find out about his
- Already run it.
There' s no record of any living relative.
- That' s a damn shame, sir.
Alibis, grudges.
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes.
The mission director was not universally loved.
He was leading cutbacks in the programme.
With all due respect, sir...
Whatever you say.
Jerome the metronome.
I could play the piano by that heartbeat of his.
- Mr. Director, you' d be pleased to know that we have a suspect.
Who is he?
We found an unaccounted- for specimen in the South Wing.
Here' s his picture.
- An In- Valid.
- We' re still following other leads.
- Be there as it may, I' m having this posted immediately.
- I' m curious, Director.
An advantage, I should imagine, in your line of work.
- Your hiring practices...
- Our "recruitment philosophy".
- Who do you have to be, to be here?
- Naturally, our standard is beyond that of the common citizen.
But amongst all that people you must have various levels of excellence.
But nothing that would prohibit someone from working in a field such as law enforcement, for example.
Now, there are enough of the right kind of people to warrant a new measuring stick.
Bodies with minds to match.
Essential, as we push out further and further.
- Yet you still constantly monitor performance.
- You have to ensure the people are meeting their potential.
- And exceeding it?
- No one exceeds his potential.
- It would mean we did not accurately gauge his potential in the first place.
- Are you all right, Jerome?
The entry log for the last 7 days.
What about you, Irene?
Do you have an alibi?
- I was alone.
- I find that hard to believe.
- Excuse me.
I' il take care of that for you, Mr. Morrow.
- I see I' m not the only one who looks up every time there' s a launch.
- Hello Jerome.
- It' s awful about the director.
- Awful it didn' t happen sooner.
Didn' t he threaten to cancel your mission more than once?
Somebody did you a favour.
- Do they have any idea whose hand I should be shaking?
- They found an eyelash in the S Wing.
- Does it have a name?
I had you sequenced.
I read your profile.
I' m sorry.
Seems you' re everything they say you are and more.
What about you, Irene?
You' re engineered just like the rest of us.
Not quite.
"Unacceptable likelihood of heart failure." I think that' s what the manual says.
The only trip I' il take in space is around the sun on this satellite, right here.
If there' s anything wrong with you, I can' t see it from where I' m standing.
Here.
Take it.
If you' re still interested, let me know.
I' m sorry.
The wind caught it.
Is this the approach path we discussed?
- Absolutely, Director.
Listen to what I' m saying to you, I want what I ordered.
It' s a completely different colour.
I' m bored of talking to you.
I' m bored.
I' il call you back.
Any full tone is two shades light.
And she said:
I don' t want to change!
We can' t use a change!
- Now I' il probably gonna have to pay for the 5 boxes they' ve sent me.
- We can' t stay here.
- The idiots I have to deal with, you wouldn' t believe!
- They think I killed the mission director.
- What makes them think that?
- They found my eyelash.
- Where?
- In the corridor.
They could have found it in your eye.
They' ve got my picture posted up all over the place.
I can' t turn around without seeing my own face.
- They won' t recognize you.
- They will recognize me!
- I don' t recognize you.
They won' t marry the eyelash to you, -
- they won' t believe that one of their elite could' ve suckered them all this time.
No, we change nothing we do as we planned.
You' re Jerome Morrow, Navigator 1st Class.
I' m not Jerome Morrow.
I' m a murder suspect.
What are you doing?
That' s more than a day' s worth!
Wait.
- We can' t stay here.
- Stop that!
Oh fine, fine!
But you' re not taking that stuff.
That stuff is mine!
- if I' d known you' d go belly- up on me at the last fuckin 'gasp.
You can' t quit on me now.
I' ve put too much into this.
What do you want me to do?
Wheel in there and finish the job myself?
- Eugene, they are going to find me.
- You still don' t understand, do you?
When they look at you, they don' t see you any more.
Keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.
How could you be so careless?
- I' m going out.
- Where are you going?
Well if I' m gonna get arrested tomorrow, I' m gonna go out tonight.
- Are you sure that' s a good idea to go out?
- That was your idea not to change anything.
- Who' s going?
- I' d say everybody.
If I don' t go it' il look suspicious.
You don' t want to look suspicious, do you?
Thanks.
Who ordered this?
What are we doing here?
I' m following a lead.
Forgive me, sir but that' s what I do.
I follow leads.
- Why makes you think the owner of the eyelash is here?
- He' s an In- Valid, sir.
- This is where the In- Valids are.
He' s an In- Valid clever enough to go unregistered all these years.
You think he' s likely to lie down for us now?
- What do you suggest, sir?
- Move the inquiry back to the scene.
Random stops.
- You' re a navigator?
At Gattaca?
- That' s what it says, doesn' t it?
- It doesn' t say you' re crippled.
- I' m not crippled.
I hurt my leg training, you moron.
How dare you question me?
What' s your number?
- No, what' s your number, you fucking flatfoot!
What do you want?
An apology?
It gets to you, doesn' t it.
It gets to you that I can be where you can only dream of.
I' m getting off this ball of dirt!
- How dare you question me!
That' s harassment.
- My mistake.
What' s your number?
May I remind you that this is a crime scene.
What' s this man doing here?
- What are you doing, old man?
- Doing my job, sir.
- This is evidence.
- You didn' t know?
- Oh yes, yeah.
- Wonderful, wasn' t it?
12 fingers or 1, it' s how you play.
That piece can only be played with 12.
- What' s all this about?
- It' s probably nothing.
No, you better not.
I don' t want to give you a contaminated specimen.
Get my meaning?
Thanks.
You never know where those swabs have been.
I want to show you something.
Come on, we' il miss it.
We' il miss it.
What did I tell you?
Strange.
Your eyes look different.
- I guess it must be the light.
Positive match.
I' m impressed.
- The cup was definitely used since the original sweep?
- Two samples, two days.
- Or he still works there.
- I thought we checked all the service staff.
I don' t think he cleans up the place any more.
I have a feeling he might be there on a false pretense, playing somebody else' s
- A borrowed ladder at Gattaca?
- That' s far- fetched, but is not out of a possibility.
I find it hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.
Even if he got past their security system, he wouldn' t have the mental faculty or the physical stamina.
Maybe you' re underestimating.
Maybe he is an imposter and maybe the director found out about it.
That could be his motive.
I say we sample every employee within the parameters intravenously.
We' d be closing them down for days.
No, a fingertip sample or a urine should be sufficient.
I suggest blood from the vein.
I hope I' m not out of line.
It' s only a matter of time, sir.
What' s with the plungers, Lamar?
You' re openin 'up a blood bank?
Only the gentlemen from the law enforcement are concerned that my testing methods have been compromised.
- I' m sorry.
- Are you out of practice, Lamar?
- Let me look at that.
- Luckily, it looks as though we have enough.
Well if you need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
- So you didn' t do it after all?
- I guess someone beat me to it.
I guess.
I leave in two days.
I guess you know that.
But...
That' s the last.
- He' s not here.
- No, we miss something
- I say we test again.
- Test?
I cannot allow you to disrupt our operations any further.
You' re not at all concerned about having amurderer in your midst?
Now, your presence is creating more of a threat.
- So it' s rather crucial we leave on time.
- Mission means a great deal to you, doesn' t it?
Your late colleague opposed it.
You won' t find a violent bone in my body.
My apologies, Director.
He won' t trouble you any further.
This is not the only place we can look.
OK, let' s start making the rounds.
Not as lucky as some.
- I know something about that.
What heart problem did you ever have?
Did you get yours broken once?
I had this crazy idea that you were more interested in the murder case than me.
You' re right.
That' s a crazy idea.
Would you like to dance?
It' s funny.
And when you finally get your chance to leave, you find a reason to stay.
- A year is a long time.
- Not so long.
Just once around the sun.
Hello, everyone, nice to see you, I' m your detective for the evening.
Please don' t leave the premises.
I said nobody leave!
Am I speaking in some kinda strange foreign language?
Check the hands, lenses, dentures, napkins, I want cigarette butts, the saliva off tea cups.
That' s a familiar face.
- I thought you wanted to dance.
- Where are you going?
- Oh yeah...
- Are you insane?
- Come on!
Where did they go?
Come on.
- Don' t you understand, I can' t do that!
- Shh, you just did.
Don' t touch your face. Don' t swallow.
Let' s clean his teeth.
Vincent!
Who' s Vincent?
Don' t say anything.
What happened?
The scars on your legs?
Remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron?
This is the exact height of the front fender.
Looked left instead of right.
- Did you just make that up or do you use all the time?
- I use it all the time.
- I know you had something to do with the Director' s death.
- That' s not true, Irene.
Isn' t that the man from last night?
He' s nobody.
He' s one of our best.
I' m certain he has nothing to do with this business.
You don' t look well, Jerome.
Why don' t you go home?
- Can I help you?
- I' m looking for Jerome Morrow.
I' m sorry, he' s ill.
A little nausea.
It' s quite common before a mission.
I oughta pay him a visit.
I understand you can show me the way?
You don' t know who he is, do you, Irene?
- Hello?
- Eugene, I need you to be yourself for the day.
- The investigators are coming by.
I' m supposed to be sick.
- So you keep telling me?
- How long have I got?
- Not long.
I guess he' s not home.
- I' m here to see Jerome Morrow.
- That' s me.
I guess he' s home.
Come in.
Come in.
Where' s my kiss?
- Good to see you' re feeling better.
- Of course, now that you' re here.
Who' s your friend?
How can I help?
- It' s about the Director.
- Again?
- I hope it' s no trouble.
- No, no, no trouble.
- Forgive me for not giving your guided tour.
- Can' t we do this another time?
- This won' t take a moment.
- Maybe he can tell me why I' m ill.
Who were you expecting?
- Yes?
- We have our man, sir.
- You have him?
- We have him in custody.
- How are you, Jerome?
- Not bad, Jerome.
- How the hell did you get up here?
I' ve been faking it.
- Don' t touch me!
- Listen to me, Irene!
- I don' t even know who you are.
- I' m the same person I was yesterday.
- I can' t hear anymore of your lies, Jerome.
My name is Vincent Anton Freeman.
And I' m a faith birth or a de- gene- erate or whatever you wanna call it.
But I' m not a murderer.
- You' re a God- child?
- Well we do have one thing in common.
Only I don' t have 20- 30 years left in mine.
Mine is already 10, 000 beats overdue.
- It' s not possible.
- You are the authority on what is not possible, -
They' ve got you looking so hard for any flaw, that after a while that' s all that you see.
For whatever it' s worth, I' m here to tell you that it is possible.
It is possible.
Congratulations, sir.
His spit was found in the dead director' s eye.
While I was busy obsessing about an eyelash, your instincts took us in the right direction.
So the In- Valid had nothing to do with this?
No, our friend here acted alone.
This mission meant everything to him, didn' t it?
He knows that if they miss this launch window he wouldn' t live to see the next one.
And since nothing can stop the launch now, he' s being very, very cooperative.
- So, I imagin you' il be celebrating tonight, sir?
- I think she likes us.
- Yeah, sure, just give her a little time and she' il get used to the idea.
- What was he like?
- Who, the cop?
- Yeah.
- Did you catch his name?
- Actually my name was the topic of conversation.
- Yeah well, he' il be back.
- You heard what he said, they have their man.
It' s over.
No, it' s not over.
I have to meet him.
My God, you have changed.
- Has it been so long, you don' t recognize your own brother?
Our parents both died thinking they' d outlived ya.
I had my doubts.
- What are you doing here, Anton?
- I should ask you that question.
- I have a right to be here.
- You almost sound as if you believe that.
I committed no murder.
You must be disappointed.
You committed fraud.
I can get you out of here.
- Do you have any idea what it took to get in here?
- You' ve gone as far as you can go.
You come with me now!
- There' s still a few million miles left to go.
- It' s over.
- I' m telling you...
God!
Even you are going to tell me what I can and can' t do now?
In case you haven' t noticed, I don' t need any rescuing.
But you did, once.
- You' ve got all the answers, how do you explain that?
- You didn' t beat me that day.
I beat myself.
- Who are you trying to convince?
- Do you want me to prove it to you?
It' s not important, Anton.
Do you want me to prove it to you?
I' il prove it to you!
I do.
We' re too far out!
- Do you wannna quit?
- We' repbr too far out!
How are you doing this, Vincent?
How have you done any of this?
We have to go back.
It' s too late for that.
We' re close to the other side.
- What other side?
Do you want to drown us both?
You want to know how I did it?
This is how I did it, Anton.
I never saved anything for the swim back.
You couldn' t see, could you?
That night, crossing the street.
You crossed anyway.
If you' re still interested, let me know.
Sorry...
The wind caught it.
You' re flying today, aren' t you?
Look at what a mess you' re in.
- come on, I have your samples ready.
- I don' t need any samples where I' m going.
You might when you get back.
Everything you need to last you two lifetimes.
- Why have you done all this?
- So Jerome will always be here when you need him.
- Where are you going?
- I' m travelling, too.
- I don' t know how to thank you.
I got the better end of the deal.
I only lent you my body.
You lent me your dream.
Not until you' re upstairs.
- What is this?
- Flight got you nervous?
- There' s a problem, Lamar.
I never did tell you about my son, did I?
He' s a big fan of yours.
Just remember that I was as good as any and better than most.
- He wants to apply here.
- I could have gone up and back and nobody wouldn' t have been the wiser.
Unfortunately, my son' s not all that they promised.
But then, who knows what he could do?
For future reference, right- handed men don' t hold it with their left.
Just one of those things.
You' re going to miss your flight, Vincent.
For someone who was never meant for this world, -
Of course, they say every atom in our bodies was once part of a star.
Maybe I' m not leaving.
Sebastian, Sebastian, stop pouting.
Sorry.
You are not a dope.
You' re just misguided.
All the reports from your teachers say the same thing:
"Sebastian would make an exceptional student if only he would follow orders."
I can' t believe you fed the school hamster an overdose of Viagra.
I was testing the reproductive system for a science experiment...
- and I wanted to see how big -- - Enough!
Fortunately for you, you are moving to a new town.
You will have a chance to start anew.
It' s time to shape up.
Speaking of shaping up, how' s Mrs. Freeman doing?
I see she' s lost some weight.
- Thank you.
I gotta tell ya, it' s a really great thing... she' s doing for the community, censoring books and all.
That Catcher in the Rye novel really screwed me up.
Mrs. Freeman knows what' s best for young minds.
Which comes to my point.
I was wondering what you planned on doing with my file?
- It' s not very favorable and -- - And... you' d prefer if I didn' t forward it to your new school.
I' ve thought long and hard about it... and I' ve decided to send it.
I mean, if you' ve really changed, you' il rise above your past mistakes.
How can I ever thank you, sir?
Well, you have got a plane to catch, and I have got some work to do.
So, you just remember, Sebastian:
The future is what you make of it.
The future is what I make of it.
The future is what I make of it.
Got it.
I' il never forget you, sir.
Yeah, yeah, right, right.
Pansy.
Ed Freeman.
What the fuck have you done tome, you fucking asshole?
What' s wrong, pumpkin?
Have you seen my picture in the school yearbook?
Uh, yes, you look wonderful.
Wonderful?
I' m naked, you fucking idiot!
Fuck.
I' m the laughingstock of the community.
How could you have let this happen?
You weaselly little piece of shit!
You' il pay for this!
Ed, I hate you!
Asshole!
Don' t think you are gonna get away with this stunt.
- So where you heading?
- New York City.
- For you.
- Thanks.
Bye- bye.
- Sebastian Valmont?
- Yeah.
I' il take care of the driver, sir.
Your family' s expecting you.
Which apartment?
The whole building, sir.
Of course.
What was I thinking?
Oh, my God!
Sebastian Valmont to see you, sir.
- Ah, good to see you again, son.
How' s your mother?
Oh, Dr. Rappaport thinks she' s gonna be in rehab for the long haul.
Thanks for taking me in.
You know, foster homes just aren' t my thing.
Think nothing of it.
Man, you really hit the mother lode this time, Pops.
Sebastian, I would like you to meet the love of my life.
This is Tiffany.
Well, it' s a pleasure to finally meet you.
I see you have your father' s beautiful blue eyes.
Thank you.
My, what a precious little kitty you have.
Would you like to pet her?
Some other time.
Sebastian, come meet Kathryn.
I' ve heard so much about you.
Welcome to the family.
I' ve always wanted a brother, but they were sold out of them at Bloomingdale' s.
- Is that a real Steinway?
- I wouldn' t play anything else.
- May I?
- Be my guest.
Kathryn is an exquisite pianist, Sebastian.
Really?
Cute.
I think it needs a tuning.
Mother, Sebastian must be famished.
Shouldn' t we check on dinner?
I think that' s a wonderful idea.
I' m so excited you' il be starting Manchester with me tomorrow.
- with wonderful teachers.
- Wonderful.
Kathryn is president of the student body.
Let' s not forget president of the French Club.
I live for extracurricular activities.
Student body president?
I am.
I believe one should not be hampered in achieving one' s goals... simply by the paltriness of one' s years.
- You mean "dearth."
- Excuse me.
Well, paltriness implies insignificance... but really it' s your lack of age that shouldn' t hamper you... from achieving your goals.
Careful with those SAT words.
They can be deadly.
Thank you.
Isn' t Kathryn just the best, son?
- Yeah, she' s a real peach, Dad.
- I love you, Step daddy.
I' m a little tired from all the travel.
Do you mind if I turn in?
Not at all.
I know you have a big day ahead of you tomorrow.
I' il show you to your room.
- I was not -- What?
- You hear me?
Do not fuck with me.
So... he outdoes you at piano, he outdoes you at vocabulary.
I guess I overestimated you.
And don' t sulk.
It' s a sign of weakness.
Yes, Mother.
No, everything' s fine.
I was just checking up on you, Mom.
Look, I promised I' d take care of you, right?
Well, I' m gonna talk to Dad and get you into a better facility.
It' s the least he can do.
I love you too.
- What the -- - Let' s get something straight!
I may not have fooled you, but I' ve got a great thing going with the rentals.
I don' t have a curfew, they never bother me about my homework... and I' ve got a five- figure allowance.
No one -- and I mean no one -- is about to threaten my cushy lifestyle... especially not some two- bit hick loser.
- But -- - I don' t wanna hear it.
Now, as for school, you stay out of my face... and we' il get along just fine, but if you cross me once...
I' il bury your sorry ass, understood?
All right.
I' m glad we could have this little discussion.
Not bad.
- What' s the matter?
- This collar' s too tight.
Oh, I guess you' re only used to wearing mesh shirts where you come from.
More SAT vocabulary builders?
For your information, this happens to be my orientation speech.
Who are you orienting?
Please, be more stupid.
I am the student body president.
Ivy League schools eat this extracurricular crap up for supper.
You do know what an Ivy League school is?
Stop!
Gordon Anderson -- looking good.
Do me a favor.
Pretend you don' t know me.
My God, you' re beautiful.
- Excuse me?
- Oh, I said you were beautiful.
Thank you.
Excuse me, but what did you mean by that remark?
- What remark?
- That I' m beautiful.
- Well, yeah.
I mean, no, no, but --
Never mind.
You' re very strange.
I know.
Yeah.
I heard he' s a total joke.
I wouldn' t know.
The headmaster will see you now.
I have never seen a file quite like this.
4. 0 GPA, president of several clubs... all- star snowboarding for your county... as well as several glowing letters from your teachers... including your former principal.
We were very close, he and I, sir.
- Yes, it' s most impressive.
- Thank you.
Perhaps a little too impressive.
Thank you.
That aside, I' m sure an enterprising young man like yourself... would be a welcome addition here at Manchester.
- Thank you, sir.
- Come in.
You had a few grammaticals, but nothing reprehensible.
Thank you, honey.
Sebastian, I' d like you to meet my daughter, Danielle.
You' re both in the same class.
You look familiar.
Have we met?
No, I don' t think so.
Are you sure?
Must' ve been someone else.
Well, I' d better get going.
It was very nice meeting you, sir.
Ma' am.
- Good luck, Sebastian.
- Thank you, sir.
Don' t you think?
- We' il see.
Be seated.
We will now hear from your new student body president...
Kathryn Merteuil.
Fellow students, faculty, administrators and custodians...
I would personally like to welcome each and every one of you... to what I think will be Manchester' s proudest year.
- She is such an inspiration.
- I consider... each and every one of you... members of my Manchester Prep family.
With that said, I feel it is our responsibility to... reach out and accept all new students... as members of --
And accept all new students as --
- Settle down, people.
As I was saying, I consider each and every one of you... members of my Manchester Prep --
- Sorry.
It happens when I get nervous.
Guess I just need a bubble gum fix.
Keep going.
You' re doing great.
Thanks.
Once again, as I was saying...
I consider each and every one of you members... of my Manchester Prep family.
With that said, I feel that it is our responsibility to reach out... and accept all new students --
Somebody do something!
Good going, Danielle.
Bravo!
Terrific.
Right.
Sparing me the Cliff Notes synopsis.... who can tell me what this means?
Mr. Winkler.
Jekyil was a doctor... and he developed this potion that transformed into...
Edward Hyde, his evil side.
My gosh, did that answer suck.
Now come on, I know you' ve got it in you.
What themes can be discussed here?
Miss Sherman.
I think Stevenson is talking about the duality of man.
Man has both good and evil in him.
If man cannot suppress his evil instincts, he is inevitably doomed.
- Wrong!
- Care to elaborate on that?
Nowhere in the novel does Stevenson mention good over evil.
In fact, it' s just the opposite.
Jekyil loved Hyde so much that he protected him from the world.
He protected Hyde so he wouldn' t hurt people.
He loved hurting people.
- Then why does Jekyil kill himself?
- Where does it say that in the book?
- The end!
Mr. Utterson found his body.
- Utterson was idiotic.
- Your point is idiotic.
Break it up, you two.
Am I losing my mind... or did we just witness an intellectual debate in this classroom?
Although I disagree with your conclusions, Mr. Valmont...
I do appreciate your warped point of view.
As for you, Miss Sherman...
I think you could be a little more tolerant of other people' s opinions.
Hey, fellas, welcome back.
Hey, Rene, good to see you.
Assistant Headmaster Mueller!
Steve.
I thought I told you not to call me by my first name.
- Later.
I' m busy right now.
- Stop that.
- I said, we need to talk.
What is it?
Do you see something wrong?
I have gym.
You know I loathe gym.
We Merteuils do not like to perspire.
What is this "we Merteuils" nonsense?
You' re a student.
Try acting like one.
- Excuse me?
- Look, Kathryn, rules are rules.
- I' m sorry, but you' re going to gym.
- I understand.
- Yes.
But it' s a bit strange...
like you did to me this summer in the Hamptons?
Now you know that' s not entirely true.
It was you who seduced me.
It was me who seduced you.
But then again, who will the school board believe?
It' s my word against yours.
Think about it, Steve.
Something like this could ruin your career... not to mention your marriage.
But I guess if you can bend the rules a little, then so can I.
- I' il see what I can do.
- You' re the best.
This meeting of the Manchester Tribunal will now come to order.
- Thank you, Blaine.
I welcome you to this year' s first meeting of the Manchester Tribunal.
As your new leader, I promise to do my best... to weed out the geeks, losers and underprivileged... and toss their fat asses out of our school.
- Here' s the latest shipment, Mrs. Gagin.
- Thank you.
Could you re- shelf these for me?
Thanks.
- My God!
A cartoon cock?
- Hi.
- Are you all right?
- You scared me to death.
- You dropped this.
- I didn' t drop it.
Yes, you did, but it' s all right.
Sexual curiosity is nothing to be ashamed of.
I' m not ashamed, and I have a very healthy sexual curiosity.
Really?
- So what are you doing here?
- I work here.
Do you think you can take a 1 5- minute break and join me for a cup of coffee?
I' d love to, but unfortunately I have a lot of work to do around here.
Mrs. Gagin, do you mind if Danielle joins me for a coffee break?
Please, go right ahead.
There' s nothing to do right now.
- Thank you.
- You don' t quit, do you?
Whatever happened to "be nice to the new kid in school"?
- Fifteen minutes.
- Go.
Next.
Michael Keen, freshman.
Former BMOC of his junior high school.
Don' t let his bad acne dissuade you, though.
His father owns the Coliseum.
Let' s get him a facial and see if he can score front- row tickets to Hole.
Next.
Sebastian Valmont, sophomore.
Son of Edward and Corrine.
- I can' t.
He' s a transfer student, and I don' t have any more information on him yet.
Don' t you know anything else about him?
He is your stepbrother.
I' ve only known him for a day.
He' s a total loser.
I mean, he shops at the Gap.
Stay on him and see what you can find out.
- Will do.
- Next.
Cherie Clayman, freshman.
Daughter of Hubert and Bunny.
Annual family income --
Well? $850 million.
- She' s richer than Kathryn.
- I heard that.
She has a GPA of 1. 3, and not only is she a virgin... but she never even kissed a boy before.
Okay, this girl is a walking Teletubby... just begging to be made an example of.
I think I' il oversee this one personally.
When I get through with her, she will be the premiere slut at Manchester Prep.
Next order of business: grievances.
Yes, Lauren?
Well, it appears we' re having a bit of trouble with the new school chef.
Mr. Washington seems to think that sushi... is an inappropriate meal for growing girls and boys.
All those in favor of sending Mr. Washington... back to his hot dog stand, say aye.
- Aye.
Okay, bye- bye, Mr. Washington.
Hello, Mr. Yakamoto.
So, what' s a nice girl like you doing at a snobbish school like Manchester?
It' s called free tuition.
Besides, it' s not as bad as it seems.
My dad took over the place a year after my mom passed away.
I' m sorry.
Your turn.
Folks split up ten years ago.
Mom has a drug problem.
And everyone thought it would be best if I moved in with my dad.
You get along with him?
I don' t really know him.
He' s on his fourth marriage.
- Yeah.
I know this is rude, but what' s it like growing up with all that money?
Well, you know, I' m only one day into it.
Sorry to disappoint you, my dear, but Richie Rich I' m not.
And I thought I was the only one at Manchester.
You ever get the feeling you' re being watched?
- Hers.
There you are, silly goose.
I' ve been looking all over for you.
Hi, Danielle.
How' s the used bookstore?
- Don' t let her get to you.
- She doesn' t.
Maybe it makes me uncool, but I don' t care what your stepsister thinks of me.
Actually, I think that makes you very cool.
I don' t want her to make me hitch a ride home.
- Yeah.
I' il call you later.
- Don' t underestimate me.
Don' t underestimate Kathryn.
- Let' s go.
- See you.
Bye.
Nice first day, retard?
It was great!
This uptight bitch got gum stuck in her hair.
Touch?.
Hi.
Cherie, it' s Kathryn, from school.
No, I don' t hate you.
As a matter of fact, I was just appointed your big sister.
Can you come out tonight?
It' s a school event.
Great!
I' il pick you up at 8: 00.
See you, sweetie.
You' re going out with the girl who spit gum in your hair?
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
She' s just a freshman.
Pick on someone your own size.
Like you?
In due time.
So, you have a thing for boring virgins.
Danielle is a virgin, you know?
Careful, Kathryn.
Ooh.
You actually have a backbone.
- Don' t push me, Kathryn.
- Any time you want to start a war --
I' il keep it under consideration.
Yeah!
Good evening, Master Sebastian.
And how was your evening jaunt?
Not bad, Henry.
Not bad at all.
Dinner with a sheik.
Cook has your meal ready.
Will you be showering before or after dinner, sir?
- I hadn' t really thought about it.
Anything I can do to make your evening more relaxing, just let me know.
Thanks, Henry.
This way, sir.
Please make yourself comfortable.
G? nter has prepared sweetbread mousse.
It' s like dinner at the Adams Family.
Guys.
Hello?
Anyone?
Is everything all right?
Henry, I think I' il get something later, go out or something.
If you need the car, just let Frederick know.
Sure.
No, it' s not like that at all.
- Well, of course, I miss you.
- You do?
We' il get together very soon.
I promise.
- What are you wearing?
- Just -- Edward!
- I didn' t hear you knock.
- I didn' t.
- That was my accountant on the phone.
You guys must have a really tight relationship.
Now, look, son, don' t make me regret taking you in.
Well, I see that old habits die hard, or, in your case, don' t die at all.
I' m your father, and I demand to be treated with some respect.
- A man has needs -- - Look, Dad, spare me the melodrama.
But, a word of advice?
You got a pretty good thing going here.
I wouldn' t screw it up, if I were you.
You know, Sebastian, I really like these father- son chats.
You' re a real role model.
Would you sit the fuck down!
Thanks, Moose.
Shut up, losers.
One mineral water, one iced tea.
This sure doesn' t taste like an iced tea.
It' s from Long Island.
Here, have another.
- What' s the latest, Kathryn?
- Me, as usual.
Court, I' d like you to meet Cherie Clayman.
How' s it going, Cherie?
Excuse me.
I think we should adjourn to the ladies' room.
- But I don' t have to go.
- I do.
So what do you need my help for?
- Want some more?
- No.
- Right.
- So how do you know he likes me?
- I can see it in his eyes.
If you say so.
So what do I do about it?
You' re gonna have to let him fuck you.
But I' ve never even been to first base with a guy.
Well, so we' il start with first base and then we' il move on.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Ready?
- Ready.
- That was easy.
- Okay, we' re gonna try this again.
This time I want you to close your eyes.
Court' s gonna stick his tongue in your mouth.
Okay?
Ready.
You idiot!
These are $300 pants.
I' m sorry.
Stupid bitch.
He hates me.
There, there.
- Hello?
- I told you not to underestimate me.
- You' re unbelievable.
- Thank you.
Oh, come on.
The TV series MASH was way better than the movie.
- If you say so.
- I do.
What time is it?
- It' s 1 0: 30.
Whoo.
Call the police.
Homework.
Hey, listen, what are you up to on Saturday?
I' m looking for a tour guide to show me the sights.
Oh, I can' t, I have plans.
Come on, you gotta rescue me from my psycho stepsister.
At least a few hours.
Look, don' t you think we should take this slower?
You know, I don' t really know you and --
Take what slow?
I wasn' t asking you on a date.
- I just wanted to make a new friend.
- I know, I wasn' t --
- Man, are you conceited.
It' s just --
- I have to go.
- Hello?
Always make an impression.
- Psycho stepsister?
- Evening.
Evening.
Oh, she shot you down.
Exactly the opposite.
So what' s on the agenda?
Matinee of The Lion King?
Man, you really have it out for her, don' t you?
It must really burn your ass that with all your money and popularity... she still won' t have anything to do with you.
Face it, Kathryn -- she' s outclassed you.
How dare you talk to me like that, you son of a bitch?
Well, this has been fun.
Unfortunately, I have some work to do, and you have to go throw up.
After all, it was a very big salad you had for dinner.
- Have you been spying on me?
- Oh, my God, I ate a crouton!
We' il see who gets the last laugh, brother dear.
Oh, no, I' m sorry!
It' s all my fault.
I wasn' t thinking.
I' il get it.
Sorry.
It' s okay.
It' s okay.
- Stop crying.
- Just don' t tell anyone.
What is this, Ben Hur?
Do they beat you here?
Please don' t tell anyone.
Min Lin, relax.
Christ, it' s like a fucking Godzilla movie.
- You girls know the routine?
- Seduce.
And destroy.
Shut up.
Mm, very nice.
Who the fuck are you?
And you?
I' m Sarah, and this is Gretchen.
We had a sleep over at Kathryn' s, and we' re running a little late.
Do you mind if we share your shower?
- Yeah.
Yeah, be my guest.
- Thank you.
Ooh, pass me the loofah.
So, what year are you guys?
- Cool.
How do you like Manchester, Sebastian?
It' s -- it' s unbelievably --
- Unbelievably what?
- Unbelievably hard.
- It certainly is.
Down, boy.
So, you guys sisters?
More like kissing cousins.
Slippery when wet.
So, you' re seeing Danielle Sherman?
Who?
Oh, yeah, yeah, trying to.
- She' s a sweet girl.
- You guys would make a great couple.
Just too bad you' re gonna miss out on all the action.
- What action?
With the exception of Danielle, Manchester Prep' s a virtual whorehouse.
As the school motto goes...
"If you don' t snort it, suck it."
- Careful.
- He splurged.
But you won' t have to worry since you' il be dating the headmaster' s daughter.
No.
Guess not.
- See you on campus.
- Ring toss.
Score.
Yes!
Thanks for, you know, sharing.
- Here, sis, I' il dry you off.
- Thanks.
Shit.
Breakfast was late, my skirt is mussed... and I needed the car last night.
- I' m sorry, Miss Merteuil -- - No excuses!
Now, just because my mother is out of town does not mean you can slack off.
Each lapse, each oversight, will be reported.
Good, you haven' t left.
Saddam addressing the troops?
- Allow me, sir.
- No, it' s all right, Henry.
Pay close attention.
The perfect Windsor is an art.
- Rough night last night?
- There was a pea under my mattress.
- No, Henry, it was great.
It was a ten.
Can we go now, or do we send Kapoor in our place?
I almost forgot.
Here are your allowances.
Semiannual?
- Weekly, of course.
- This is amazing.
The leftovers, sir.
It' s what I like to call mad money.
Yeah, mad.
Unless you use it to make someone happy.
For the Windsor and the advice.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.
Very kind.
Tutor me in French?
Tutor me in French?
Danielle!
Oh, my gosh, am I glad I found you?
Look, I am flunking French, like tres flunking it.
D- minus.
- Have you been studying?
Of course, I study like crazy, but it just goes in one hole and out the other.
- You can!
You can tutor me.
Mom said I can pay you, unless that' s like too totally insulting... because, you know, we' ve got money, and you' re the headmaster' s daughter... and headmasters make, like, zilch.
Thanks.
Tutor me, please, please.
I' il pay you $200 an hour, $200.
Stop.
Of course I' il tutor you.
The money doesn' t matter.
Going rate will be fine.
God, why does everything have to be about money?
'Cause it' s cool.
- Do you hear a phone?
- Yeah.
Oh, wait.
Sounds like it' s coming from here.
- I don' t have a phone.
- You do now.
Oh, my God, so cool.
Is it your birthday or something?
- Hello?
- Do you like the phone?
I might, if it comes with an explanation.
It does, actually.
I think I may have real feelings for you.
- It' s Sebastian Valmont, isn' t it?
- Just a second, okay?
- Not you.
Her.
- Who' s her?
- Look, I can' t do this from a phone.
But it' s a good phone.
Digital.
- Where are you?
You can' t be too far.
- Look down.
Oh, it is Sebastian Valmont.
Don' t move.
I' m coming down there.
- Hey!
Where are you?
- Close your eyes.
- Why?
- Just trust me.
- I' il look silly.
Close them now.
Danielle, wait!
The best laid plans sometimes suck.
Miss Merteuil.
- But I' m excused from gym.
- Gym, yes.
Ballet, no.
Well, there must be something I can do to change your mind.
I think you' ve got the wrong guy.
Now get your ass to ballet.
Mr. Erwick.
- and ballet.
- I can' t do anything, all right?
Hargrove called me into his office.
He' s suspicious, I heard it in his voice.
- Well, I' m not sure.
The Disciplinary Committee, of course.
You stuttered and stammered like a completely whipped fool... and then when you voted, it was obvious you voted the way I wanted you to vote.
But that' s how you did want me to vote.
Oh, my God, I' m a mess.
You' re always one step ahead of me.
I don' t know what to do anymore.
It' s a dirty old man' s catch- 22.
Shut up, Steve.
Get control of yourself.
I can' t.
I' m falling apart.
My wife doesn' t turn me on anymore, my kids hate me.
I should just quit.
Stop blubbering.
I' il go back to gym and ballet.
- The excuse slips were just a test.
The day will come when I' il need you for a favor -- a big favor -- and you' il do it without question.
Of course.
I worship you, Kathryn.
Worship works best on your knees, Steve.
Please be quiet.
I' m trying to imagine I' m with someone attractive.
Sorry.
Hello!
Anybody!
Oh, my God, she is terrible.
If it' s so bad here, why don' t you guys just quit?
It' s steady employment, sir.
This is a good address.
We could be down in the 50s!
Or worse, Scarsdale.
Ladies there make me crazy!
All the time sending me to the market looking for gefilte.
My father -- fisherman for 20 years -- he never caught one gefilte.
What is a gefilte?
- Three kings.
- Man!
- That beats my two pairs.
- I got crap.
Full house, jacks over threes.
You win again, Master Sebastian.
You know, Henry, I really wish you' d quit with the "master" thing.
But sir, it' s your title.
It shows privilege.
Yeah, well, what has it gotten me?
I poured all my money into gifts and didn' t get the girl.
Danielle hates my wealth or resents it or something.
Perhaps it' s not my place to speak, sir.
No, Henry, please.
I' m desperate here.
Well, maybe she doesn' t want to feel like she' s being bought.
- You think that' s it?
- I don' t know.
Women are complicated.
It' s been my experience, sir, that women are more interested... in the soul of a man than in his trappings.
What is going on around here?
I had to ring and ring.
And where were you, Frederick?
I had to take a cab.
A cab!
I' m sorry, we were just --
Get out of here, all of you.
And you can be damned sure my mother' s gonna hear about this.
- No, she won' t.
- What did you say?
You' re not telling anybody about this.
This was my idea.
I ordered them to play cards.
Great year.
Blitzkrieg, wasn' t it?
Don' t get smart.
Whether you realize it or not, you are still a guest in this house.
You know, you treat these people like dirt.
No wonder they don' t respect you.
We pay them for service, not respect.
Maybe someday you' il learn that.
And one day you' il realize that they' re human beings.
Just give me a second here.
Party' s over.
You know, I don' t get it.
Look, if you hate your mother so much... why work so hard to be just like her?
Is that what you think I' m doing?
Well, you' re obviously trying to prove something to someone.
No one' s this mean, unless -- unless there' s a whole bunch of pain and suffering behind it.
You think you have it so tough, having to come into this strange house... with strange people -- try growing up here.
Try spending every moment of your life just making up for just being here.
- That doesn' t make any sense.
- No, it doesn' t, does it?
You feel out of place, Sebastian?
You want to fit in?
Guess what.
So do I.
What a mess.
- Hello.
- Sebastian?
It' s Cherie.
News flash.
Danielle is totally, madly in love with you.
Madly in love with me?
She hates me.
- Every move I make is the wrong move.
- Yeah, but she told me stuff..
Every time she thinks about you, every time she sees you, she gets all moist. "Moist"?
Her eyes -- she gets tears in them.
But look, time' s running out.
You gotta move now.
She' il be in the city tonight -- dinner with her favorite aunt, Riverside Cafe.
I figure if you go there, bare your soul --
No gifts though.
She hates that money thing.
Hello?
Closet street performer.
Now you know all my secrets.
How did you know I was here?
Already know.
Cherie the blabbermouth.
Weird girl, but if you get beyond all the "totallys" and "oh, my Gods"... there' s real truth there.
- I have to catch my train.
I' il make sure you get home all right.
You can come as far as the station and only if you can do it without talking.
Not another word -- that' s my condition.
Condition accepted.
All right, all right!
Stop!
I give up, okay?
Stop playing.
You know, I think this is the most romantic city on earth -- millions of strangers meeting in restaurants, parks, sidewalks -- a romance born every five seconds, every heartbeat.
I mean, God, is this a great city or what?
This is exactly what I' m talking about.
You spout BS on a continuous basis.
- Say it!
- Okay.
I wanna know what happened at school, in the courtyard.
I kissed you, and you just ran off.
I' m crazy about you!
I' m trying everything I can to make you like me.
Be yourself.
Be honest.
Why is that so difficult?
I don' t know.
Maybe I' m scared.
You know, I' m new here, right?
New to this city... new at school...
living in a house full of certifiable wackos... and I don' t have any friends... at least, any I can trust.
And I' m confused.
God' s honest truth, I' m in a state of perpetual confusion.
So what are you scared of?
Missing my train.
Bye.
As you know, your mother gets home tonight.
And you want me to keep quiet about the poker game.
I don' t like these ideas Sebastian' s putting in your head.
- Well, I' m offended.
Leave.
I' il finish alone.
Min Lin, wait.
Why don' t you and I get to know each other, like with Sebastian last night?
- Do I have to?
- Come on, it' il be fun.
Here.
I' il jump right in.
Where are you from -- China, Japan?
Cambodia actually.
Cambodia -- wonderful country.
And when did you come to our United States?
My family fled through Vietnam.
Ultimately, we were 1 20 crammed into a boat the size of your pantry.
Oh, my gosh, that reminds me of this time in Denver, coming home from Aspen.
The first- class lounge was packed.
We almost had to fly coach.
Anyway, so your family fled the Khmer Rouge?
Nothing subtle about that shade of rouge.
We do have a lot in common.
Will there be anything else, Miss Kathryn?
No, that' s all.
I' m glad we did this, aren' t you?
Oh, yes.
Very enlightening.
Bitch.
You got all your pronouns mixed up.
"Vous" is "you."
Unless it' s someone you' re crazy, madly in love with... in which case it' s "tu," as in you and Sebastian.
I swear, that thing with the phone -- so cool.
I would have piddled right there on the spot.
Oh, wait, did I show you my doodle?
- Excuse me?
- My doodle, my sketch.
- Just tell me:
Is this it?
- Is it the real thing?
- Like I even know what that is.
Knees go weak, mouth goes dry... you get that little tingling feeling in that special place.
He' s just so slick, so sure of himself.
I have a lot of trouble trusting him.
He can' t just come out and talk to me, say what he' s really feeling... and neither can I.
Okay, chapter three.
Read the translation of the first passage. "Love is a sublime melting pot in which men and women are fused together.
The lover is a priest, the ravished virgin a trembling sacrifice. "
A priest and a virgin?
That' s sick!
Move.
Move.
- Hi, Mr. Nagao!
- Hello, ladies!
I make a special eel and cuke roll today.
It' s so sad about Mr. Washington.
I mean, the fact that they found a dead rat in that student' s sloppy Joe.
He' il never work again.
So, you never told us how it went with Cherie.
- Did you bury her?
- Let' s say she' s on her way to ruin.
- Everything' s set for this weekend.
Uh, duh.
I told my mom how much fun we had... and she invited you and your mom over for nonfat lattes.
Your mom told my mom that you can sleep over.
Okay, I gotta go.
Gordon Anderson promised he' d show me his one- eyed snake, whatever that is.
Okay, see you.
Wow, Kathryn, you really showed her.
Don' t talk.
Don' t say a word.
It' s my turn to explain.
All I' ve done is hound you about being honest... when I couldn' t do it myself.
- I' il say.
- No, let me finish.
You see... it was my first kiss.
I wanted it to be perfect and right and with the right boy... and, while you might have been the right boy, the rest was totally not right.
I embarrassed you.
I embarrassed myself.
Because I know you' re used to girls with all this experience... and you' ve probably been kissing girls forever... and that' s what I was afraid to tell you.
I happen to think this is wonderful, all right?
So you weren' t exactly up- front and honest.
Join the club.
I wanted it to be perfect... not the tail end of some prank.
Does that make any sense?
Yeah.
You know, some things can' t be orchestrated.
Some things have to be spontaneous, like a kiss.
Like the kiss we' re about to have right now.
Say something, quick.
I can' t.
I have to go.
Last bell.
Okay, but... just back away so I know you' re not running away.
That was wonderful -- just precious.
How long were you there?
"I' ve never kissed a boy before -- I mean, the right boy... and you' ve probably been kissing girls forever."
You must feel like a terrible dope, leading on that poor, lovesick girl.
You don' t know what you' re talking about.
Here' s a prediction:
Of course, I could wipe her off the map tomorrow.... but I think I' il let this little romance just flicker out all on its own.
I like the girl, okay?
You screw it up, and I' il screw you up.
Nobody ever threatens me.
I just did -- or weren' t you listening?
- You do realize this means war.
- Then war it is.
Lovely.
Well, I feel badly for you, I really do... but Byron needs to be groomed every day at 3: 00.
Well, you' il just have to reschedule your daughter' s birthday.
Now, I want him saddled and ready to ride when I arrive.
Don' t keep me waiting.
Idiot!
There' s a new student at Manchester -- Cherie Clayman.
Did she die?
- I take it you don' t like her.
- I can' t stand her.
She' s actually very sweet, so I' m turning her into the school slut.
- Well, she' s now your new best friend.
- Why?
You' re not hitting up the Claymans for a donation to Manchester.
Sorry, Mother.
I think it' s an excellent idea.
- The Claymans will join us at 7: 00.
- You invited them here?
Mother, they' re from California.
Kathryn, I need this.
Just 20 million more and we can break ground on the Tiffany Merteuil Library.
Well, you ladies seem to be enjoying yourselves.
You must be tense, Sebastian.
Yeah, well, you' d be too if you were failing gym.
I mean, who ever heard of fencing as a sport?
Perhaps a massage would help.
I' ve never had a massage before.
You can have my table.
I' m suddenly not in the mood.
"Mycket," not "myckesh."
Kathryn, if you' re not going to say it correctly, don' t say it at all.
It just makes you look foolish.
Thank you for the correction, Mother.
Now, if you' il excuse me.
I think I could get used to this.
Dead puppies, dead puppies, dead puppies... old nuns in their underwear --
I thought you' d left.
- Is that Sonja or Ingrid?
- It' s Tiffany.
- I hope you enjoyed your massage.
- I think I' il go take a shower.
We' ve had so little time together, Sebastian.
We can' t be a happy family if we don' t get to know each other a little better.
You' re right, Mom.
We should talk more, Mom.
With your father working on the yacht so much, I' il have plenty of time for you.
You know, some nights he doesn' t even come home.
He loves that yacht.
I' m glad he found something he' s so committed to.
Well, the right woman will do that.
- And you think I' m the right woman?
- Definitely.
He' s a changed man.
Of course.
Without me he' d still be in Miami giving charters to geriatrics.
It' s not the money, it' s you.
He loves you.
You' re a smart boy, Sebastian.
You seem to understand your father very well.
I hope so.
So do I, because if you' re wrong, you' re both going to end up out on the street.
She spanked me.
Oh, that feels so good.
- Oh, yeah, you like that, huh?
- Dad, you here?
- Fuck!
Fuck!
Hey, son, how' s it goin '?
- In bed already?
- Oh, it' s just a catnap.
What are you doing?
Oh, I' m just looking for the cat.
Here, puss, puss, puss, puss, puss.
I hope you' re not suggesting I' m having an affair.
- I' m not suggesting anything.
- I' m your father... and I will not be treated like a criminal!
Criminal.
You could have fooled me.
And behind door number three we have --
- Hello.
- Sebastian, meet Lilly... my first mate.
Lilly, I' m Sebastian, Edward' s son.
Oh, my God, you have your father' s eyes.
Are you a Libra?
Let' s just cut right to the chase, shall we?
He offered to sail you around the world, didn' t he?
How did you know?
Leave right now, or you' re grounded for a week.
- Did he tell you he' s married?
- I was waiting for the right time.
You lied to me?
You see, she' s very sick.
I may be single any day now.
Go to hell!
Sebastian, you think you could help me out here?
Okay, okay, I know we talked about this... but you' re a man, and you have to understand --
You have to understand.
It' s not just your life anymore, Dad, it' s mine too.
Don' t screw it up for me.
Absolutely.
You can count on me, son.
The keys, please?
You know, you made your bed.
Now lie in it.
Well, this sucks.
I can' t believe I was so stupid.
I really thought your dad liked me.
It' s not your fault.
He' s the master of deceit.
He should be in the Pathological Liars' Hall of Fame.
He was in the Hall of Fame?
- Never mind.
- Sure.
- Why are men such jerks?
I mean, is it genetic or something?
You know, they promise you the world, that you' re the one for them... and that their wives don' t understand them anymore.
And I fall for it every time.
I' m like a doormat.
They' re always coming and going... and coming and going, and coming and --
My life sucks.
Lilly, you don' t need a man to be happy.
If you' re not happy alone, you' re not gonna be happy with someone else.
You' re a very attractive woman.
You could have anyone you want.
You just have to wait for the right guy to come along.
- You think I' m attractive?
- I think you' re beautiful.
You' re so sincere.
You' re not like your father at all.
Glad you were paying attention.
Do you wanna come back to my place?
I' d love to, but I have an oral report due in the morning.
Oh, I' m great at orals.
- Try me.
No, thank you.
Listen, I' m gonna split.
Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah, I' il be fine.
Psycho.
I lived in Fresnomy whole life.
Les too.
But we wanted more for Cherie, so when Les sold the biz... we decided to move to the Big Apple.
Oh, it' s no problem.
Our driver -- he takes me right there.
She' s asking you if you like it, honey.
Oh, yeah, it' s the best.
And Kathryn' s been, like, so super- nice.
like she had permanent PMS or something.
Ew, gross!
But she' s been, like, totally awesome!
I can tell she' s going to be very popular.
- Oh, I won' t be as popular as you. - "Popular" is such a bore.
The important thing is school spirit, and nobody has as much as my mother.
I do a little work for the school fund- raising committee.
You are so modest.
Mother' s already raised half the money needed for the new school library.
How much money have you raised?
Well, she barely has to do anything.
The parents practically throw it at her.
Why do they throw money at you?
Because charity is smiled upon by the ladies who lunch.
Society, Cherie.
You know -- the social ladder?
My mom said now that we' re rich... we gotta start climbing that thing.
- Isn' t she precious?
- Would you excuse me?
- Certainly.
So, how much money do you need?
Oh, I didn' t invite you over here to discuss fund- raising, Bunny... but if you' d care to make a donation, we' d certainly consider it.
Really?
Why, thank you.
My pleasure.
Oh, hi, honey.
How was your day?
I can explain this.
There' s no need to explain.
I know you love my mother very much.
Exactly.
And Sebastian and I are just getting close.
I know you' d never do anything to break up our happy home.
- Oh, no, never.
- So let' s make sure it stays happy.
I' il make reservations at 8: 00.
At 8: 45, an accordion player will pass by.
When he does, request "Under My Thumb" by the Rolling Stones.
- Jagger.
Got it.
- While she' s listening... slip this on her finger, then kiss her -- eight seconds, no tongue.
Are you getting all this?
After dinner, grappa -- one glass -- then bring her home, make love to her -- two Viagra -- any questions?
Just in case, I' ve written it all down for you.
Now, who' s your favorite daughter?
You are.
What a shame.
Morning!
Great day, isn' t it?
Bite me, rich boy!
Ah, New York -- a wonderful town.
- You look fabulous.
- Thank you.
- You got everything?
- Yeah.
You ought to take some money, just in case you need a cab, miss the train --
- Don' t worry, Dad.
I' il be fine.
- Come on, this is my job -- to worry.
- What' s wrong?
- Nothing.
Just thought about your mom.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Sebastian thought you' d like it better than the train.
I am so excited.
You know, I' m kind of nervous.
- I' ve never been on a horse before.
- Don' t worry.
I won' t let anything bad happen to you.
If I like it, then I' il have Daddy buy me a horse... then we can spend every weekend together.
I promise.
Very good, Cherie.
Back on the horse now.
I think we' re ready to try advanced jumping.
I don' t know.
He keeps throwing me off.
I guess we' d better go back to the basics -- Manuela?
Nice horsey.
I want you to push up and down in the saddle -- that' s called posting.
Now we need to add the back and forth motion.
When you hit the saddle, push backward, then forward.
Up and down, back and forth, faster, faster.
Up and down, back and forth, faster, faster.
Good.
This time I want you to really grind into the saddle.
- Okay.
I think I' m getting it.
- Posting is fun.
- Faster, faster.
Really fun.
Are you okay?
I' ve never felt better.
Now I know why girls like horses.
Wait.
I don' t know if I' m ready for this.
- It' s cool.
- I' m sorry.
It' s just that yesterday was my first kiss... and now you' re practically touching my breast.
At this rate, your dick will be in my mouth by lunch.
Anyone for lunch?
I' m kidding.
Listen, Danielle, we can take this as slow as you want.
I like you.
I' ve no need to rush things.
That' s not my problem.
I want to rush things.
I' m tired of being the only virgin in the sophomore class at Manchester.
Are you telling me that everyone in the sophomore class has done it?
Well, it sure feels like it.
I don' t know.
- Constantly.
- I mean, there' s one side of me... that wants you to throw me down right here and rip my clothes off.
Then there' s this other side of me that thinks I should wait till I' m married.
Which side should I choose, Sebastian?
You really want me to answer that?
Come on, be my friend.
I know exactly what you' re going through.
We all have two sides.
I struggle with my dark side every day.
But that was the old me.
Believe it or not, I have you to thank for it.
You showed me that it was okay to be a decent person.
How dark was your past?
Pitch black.
I' m thinking --
I think I' m falling in love with you.
But I' m afraid to take the chance to get hurt.
- I' m afraid of getting hurt too.
- Listen, let' s make a pact.
We' il take it slow, and we won' t hurt each other.
God, we sound like a cancelled television series.
You don' t have to do this.
I want to.
Hello?
Hi, Daddy.
I know, I' m running late.
Tell Aunt Gloria we can still make the 2: 00 mass.
Yeah, I' il call you when I get there.
I love you too.
- You gotta go?
- Sorry.
Call me later?
- Sure.
- Toodles.
- Bye- bye.
Oh, my balls.
- Here' s something you might like.
- Dolce.
How '98 of you.
Do you carry any real fur?
No, all of our fur is faux.
Of course.
The animals -- how silly of me.
- What' s up?
- It' s about Sebastian.
Give me the dirt.
Your stepbrother has quite the checkered past.
I mean, the fact that he was able to pay off that overnight delivery guy... and switch his school file?
That' s impressive even by my standards.
- That' s just the tip of the iceberg.
- Well done.
Cash or charge?
- I' il be there in an hour.
The new James Van Der Beek film' s playing in town.
You' re sure your dad won' t mind?
No, he' s out of town for the night.
It' s just me and Mr. Whiskers. - "Mr. Whiskers"?
- My pussy, silly.
Okay, well, I' il see you soon.
Bye.
The school virgin' s home alone with her pussy, and I' m taking her to see Dawson.
God, I' ve become a total fag.
- I guess I misjudged you.
- What are you talking about?
How' d you get this?
I have my ways.
- Kathryn, I' m trying to start over -- - Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, please.
Spare me any sob stories.
Oh, dear.
I guess something like this... could destroy your squeaky- clean reputation at Manchester.
And that school psychologist' s report about your mom -- it' s too bad.
How will she pay for rehab when I tell Mommy where some of her money' s going?
- You' re playing with fire, Kathryn.
- Poor Sebastian' s mom is going to be... homeless and eating leftovers out of the garbage.
You don' t know what I' m capable of.
Yes, I do.
I read your file.
It turns me on.
- Fuck off.
- Going to see Danielle?
Leave her out of it!
Looks like we' ve hit a sensitive spot.
Do you really think you can change, Sebastian?
You and I are two of a kind.
We' re just not cut out for good deeds.
I know the drill.
You' il date Danielle... probably sleep with her after -- what -- you think eight months?
And then you' il get bored, and you' il break her heart.
Why don' t you just spare her the pain?
Date you?
We could make a good team.
What do you plan on doing with my file?
Do I sense a merger in the air?
Perhaps.
You do realize you' re my stepsister.
You know what they say about incest.
Is there any line you won' t cross?
Only one: never in the butt.
That' s a good line.
The Bradys never had it so good.
- I can' t do this.
- Not with your pants on.
- I gotta go.
- You fucking pussy!
- What, is this about Danielle?
You don' t understand, Kathryn.
I love her.
- You have a funny way of showing it.
- Fuck you.
I won' t let you corrupt me.
You can' t change.
- I can try.
- Well, you' re gonna die trying.
- Hello?
- Hello, Danielle?
- Sebastian, you' re soaking.
- We have to talk.
Well, come inside before you catch yourself pneumonia.
Thanks.
What' s wrong?
I don' t know, it' s --
It' s okay.
You can talk to me.
Go slow.
I just -- I feel like I' m losing it.
I gotta get outta school.
It' s Kathryn, isn' t it?
I don' t think I can beat her.
Sebastian, do you believe in a higher power?
- Yes.
- Do you believe in our love?
It' s the only thing keeping me together.
- So you believe in our love?
- Yes, I believe in our love.
'Cause I sure as hell don' t.
What?
Fucking idiot.
Bravo.
- I told you I could do it.
- I should never have doubted you.
Don' t tell me you bought that virgin bullshit.
No, I saw you.
You were with your dad.
What he doesn' t know can' t hurt him.
I am the headmaster' s daughter.
Daddy' s little angel must keep up appearances.
- Holy fuck.
- Oh, don' t be such a baby.
You didn' t really think you were gonna win, did you?
- You' re welcome to join us.
You know what they say:
Two' s company, three' s a fuck load of fun.
Well, if you can' t beat 'em --
Who says you can' t beat 'em?
Share and share alike.
Sebastian -- Now you' il have something to write about.
Danielle.
- Oh, shit!
- Are you okay?
Oh, you really should try to be more careful.
Thank you.
Oh, my bike!
Could we offer you a ride home?
My mom said I' m not allowed to take rides from strangers.
Oh, it' s you.
I was just going to Danielle' s house.
- I' il take care of the bike.
- Oh, thank you so much.
I owe you huge.
- No problem.
- It' s Debbie, right?
- No, Cherie.
Whatever.
You know, Debbie, has anyone ever told you: you could be a model?
- Yeah.
- It' s too bad you' re not sexy.
- Bull!
Uh- huh.
Show me sexy.
That' s my special place.
Holy shit!
Turn to your right.
That' s it, sir.
Please follow the orange line.
We processed the roll of film we found in your bag, Mr. Parrish.
They' re not very pretty pictures.
Also, you left the camera in the hotel.
We processed that roll as well.
Can I see them?
That' s not a courtesy, Mr. Parrish.
This is evidence.
Do you guys have your own lab... or do you have to send it out?
We have a lab.
Your legal aide should be here within 30 minutes or so.
Now you understand you don' t have to talk to me until she gets here if you don' t want to.
You know that, Sy?
- Mm- hmm.
Sy, can I ask you one question?
Sure.
What was it about William Yorkin that upset you so?
I mean, what did he do to provoke all of this?
Family photos depict smiling faces...
births, weddings, holidays...
Happy birthday!
Children' s birthday parties.
People take pictures of the happy moments in their lives.
Someone looking through our photo album would conclude that we had led a joyous, leisurely existence... free of tragedy.
No one ever takes a photograph of something they want to forget.
Hey, we' re gonna go.
Sure you don' t need my help?
Yeah.
Sorry, kiddo.
Doesn' t matter.
I' m gonna get some takeout for dinner, okay?
Okay.
- See ya.
Jake, are you coming or what?
I' m coming!
There' s one.
Mom, can I check out the toys?
I' m just dropping off some film.
Make sure you can see me, okay?
Okay.
Hey, Mrs. Yorkin.
Hey, Yoshi.
How are you?
How have you been?
We' re doin 'good, thanks.
- Got 3 rolls today.
Can I get that address again?
Yes, it' s 3 -- 326 Serrano Terrace, Yoshi.
I' il take care of Mrs. Yorkin.
What have we got today?
I' ve got one in here as well.
And can I have 2 prints of each, please?
Leica Mini- Lux.
That' s a very nice camera.
- Really?
Because Will' s been trying to get me to go digital --
Oh, don' t do that.
I' d be out of a job.
You have one shot left.
Oh, that' s okay.
Oh, no, really, it' s fine.
Oh, no, please.
How' s Jake doing?
Oh, he' s great.
Just had a birthday, and --
How old is he, 9?
That' s right.
- 9.
Got a winner.
Thanks.
When do you need these by?
Can I have them today?
You know, we close at 7: 00 on Sundays.
Oh, well, it' s not important.
I can -- I can swing by tomorrow.
Mrs. Yorkin, you' re one of our best customers.
I' il have 'em for you by the time we close.
Thank you so much.
I' il go get some shopping done.
We' il see you in 40 minutes.
Thanks, Sy.
Bye.
You sliced through an exposure on that last roll, Sy.
Yes, Yoshi, I know.
I made a mistake.
Mrs. Levitt has a problem... offer her a free roll of film.
I' ve been doing P. O. S. mini- lab work for over 20 years now.
I consider it an important job.
When people' s houses are on fire... what' s the first thing they save after their pets and their loved ones are safe?
The family photos.
Some people think that this is a job for a clerk.
They actually believe that any idiot that attends a 2- day seminar can master the art of making beautiful prints in less than an hour.
But of course, like most things... there' s far more to it than meets the eye.
I' ve seen the prints they fob off on people at the Rexall or Fotek.
Milky, washed out prints.
Too dark prints.
There' s no sense of reverence for the service they' re providing for people.
I process these photos as if they were my own.
I see someone had quite a birthday party.
I did them 5x7 for you.
Oh, I wanted them 4x6.
Um, the larger ones are better.
I didn' t charge you extra for them.
Okay, um... it' s okay, I guess.
How much do I owe you, Sy?
Uh, 30. 06, but let' s just call it an even 30.
All right, thanks.
You know, we have a special gift for birthday boys.
Really?
Birthday boys get a free camera.
Wow. Jake, what do you say?
Thanks.
You' re welcome, buddy.
We' re taking Jake to Six Flags this weekend, so...
I' il see you very soon.
See you.
- Come on, Jake.
See ya, Jake.
Well, what a cool camera, huh?
Good night, A. J.
That' s just great.
Oh, look at this.
- I remember that.
- Nice truck.
Oh, you guys are so cute.
Ah.
Okay, this one' s going into the trash.
Let me see.
Look at your face.
That' s a classic.
No, you' re not getting it back.
Will, I' m serious.
Don' t give it to her.
She' s serious.
Told you.
Hey, how' d this one get in here?
- Oh, that' s Sy.
- Sy?
Sy took it to finish off the roll.
I get you anything else, Sy?
Oh, no, thanks.
Just the check' s fine.
What you got there, family photos?
Yeah.
You mind if I take a look?
Mmm, these are beautiful.
That' s a good shot.
These your, uh, relations?
That' s my little nephew, Jake.
He' s a handsome boy.
Isn' t he?
I, uh, I got him a camera for his birthday.
Well, you must be his favorite uncle then.
I don' t know.
Sure I can' t get you no more coffee then?
I' m fine, thanks.
Have a nice night now.
You, too.
Mom?
What, pookie?
I feel bad for someone.
Somebody at school?
No.
What do you mean, you feel bad?
When someone seems sad... they don' t have any friends... and people make fun of' em... that makes me feel bad for them.
Who is sad and doesn' t have any friends?
Sy.
Sy?
The photo guy at the one hour place?
Yeah.
Oh, Jake.
I really feel bad for him.
But Jake... we don' t know that Sy is sad.
We really don' t know that much about him, you know?
I mean, he might even have a lot of friends.
He probably has a girlfriend and -- and a mommy and a daddy who love him.
I don' t think he does.
That is so sweet of you to think of somebody else like that, you know?
Listen, Jake... not everybody is as lucky as we are.
You know?
But maybe if we send them good thoughts... we' il make them feel better.
So why don' t we close our eyes and send Sy some good thoughts?
Okay.
All right?
Yeah.
There.
I bet the next time we see Sy... he won' t seem so sad.
Okay.
You have to go to sleep, pookie.
Okay.
I love you.
Good night.
There you go.
How -- How do you think we pay for all this?
I' m just asking you.
What do you think... there' s a money fairy that comes and slips an envelope under my pillow every month?
What are you even talkin 'about?
Well -- Well, how -- All of this stuff... the new Mercedes, the matching washer and dryer... the fucking Jil Sander blouse you have on now -- how?
I love you, Nina.
I do... but if you continually want our life to look like something out of a magazine, I' m sorry.
I' ve gotta work to make that happen.
Do you even believe what you' re saying, huh?
This is not about things, Will... and it' s not about money.
You' re neglectful.
Do you understand that?
What?
You are an emotionally neglectful husband... and you' re an emotionally neglectful father.
Got it now?
That' s just fuckin 'great.
You' re not here, Will.
You' re not here.
You' re never here.
I' m going to bed.
Nude photos of her --
lf, in your mind --
Bart, what' s wrong with you?
Oh, my God!
Someone' s trying to kill me!
It' s for Bart.
But who' d wanna hurt me?
I' m this century' s Dennis the Menace.
It' s probably the person you least suspect.
That' s good, Dad.
Monday is our busiest day.
People tend to shoot most of their pictures on weekends.
The store has several regular customers.
There' s Mrs. Von Unwerth who only takes pictures of her cats.
I' ve never seen a picture of a human being.
Just cats.
2 copies, please, Mr. Parrish.
There' s Mr. Siskind.
Mr. Siskind is an insurance claims adjuster.
He only brings in pictures of wrecked cars.
The usual, Sy.
I need these by 3: 00.
We get all the new parents which, in this neighborhood... makes up a big part of our business.
New parents go photo crazy.
I don' t know how many rolls I have here.
Cindy, a nurse from a nearby cosmetic surgery clinic is a regular customer.
We do all of Dr. Fried' s before and after shots.
Oh, thanks, Sy.
Then there' s the amateur porn artists.
We have to report kiddie porn and animal cruelty... but anything else, no questions asked.
is look at these prints.
Plus point 3?
Sy, are you fuckin 'kiddin' me?
Nobody gives a shit until those shifts are in the double digits.
It' s blue, Larry.
Well, I bet Brandt cares about a plus point 3.
Are you fuckin 'threatening me?
You' re breakin 'my balls over a plus 3 blue shift.
Fuckin 'asshole.
Next time you call me out here... that thing better be belching fire.
That' s a great attitude, Larry.
Thanks for your precision work.
Sy.
What the hell you doin '?
Excuse me?
What was the deal with you and the AGFA guy?
Well, Bill, I' m trying to preserve a minimum level of quality for my customers.
Your customers.
And he seems to think that a plus point 3 shift to cyan is insignificant.
Sy, let me try and explain something to you one more time.
You need to take another look at your place on the food chain.
These aren' t your customers.
They' re SavMart' s customers.
If you haven' t noticed, this isn' t Neiman Marcus.
People just wanna come in here with their kids... have a good time, and save a few pennies on paper towels and socks.
If they wanted to see yelling and screaming... they' d stay at home.
It was wrong of me to create a scene in front of all those customers, Bill.
It won' t happen again.
Sy, don' t you have some vacation time saved up?
I guess I probably do.
You should take some time off.
Go down to a Club Med.
You know, relax.
Lay in the sun.
Enjoy life.
Well, I' il think about that, Bill.
And Sy, your lunch break was up 1/ 2 an hour ago, man.
What the hell you been doin 'in here?
Oh, uh, excuse me.
I' m trying to figure out if this will work with my Mac.
This isn' t my section.
You' re Will Yorkin.
Yeah.
Sy Parrish.
I' m the photo tech here.
I do all your family' s pictures.
Oh, right.
Sy, the photo guy.
Right.
Here you are in the fesh.
Yeah.
I don' t see you in here too often.
Nina usually does most of the shopping.
Um, can you help me with this?
Well, I wish I could, but this is computers... and I do photo finishing.
It' s not my section.
I' m actually in just a little bit of a rush.
I had one question I needed answered.
I' il get, uh, I' il get someone.
Customer needs immediate assistance aisle 4.
Customer assistance, aisle 4.
Someone will be here in just a minute.
Great, thanks.
So is the rest of the family here?
Uh, Jake' s around here somewhere.
You' re a very lucky man, Mr. Yorkin.
I' m sorry?
You have a wonderful family... and if you don' t mind my saying so... a very beautiful house, too.
Well, thank you, Sy, I, uh... appreciate that... but l -- you know, I really need to get all this stuff and get the hell outta here.
Hey, I understand.
Thanks for all your help, though.
Oh, it' s okay.
You say hello for me.
I will do.
Well, I gotta be gettin 'back.
There' il be someone here in just --
There you go.
Oh, uh, great.
You know, it doesn' t say here if this will work for the Mac or not.
Uh, no, this is P. C. only.
We have some Mac- based stuff down here.
Ooh!
- Hi.
I was just talking to your dad.
What do you have there?
Evangelion.
"Neon Genesis Evangelion."
What does he do?
Well, he' s a good guy.
He can fy, and he has a silver sword that can kill bad guys.
Really?
Yeah, and he' s 60 feet tall.
And you really want this, don' t you?
Yeah.
Jake.
No more toys.
We' re leaving.
I gotta go.
Well, I' il put this back for you, okay?
Thanks.
See ya later.
I told you not to talk to strangers.
I' m sure my customers never think about it... but these snapshots are their little stands against the fow of time.
The shutter is clicked... the fash goes off... and they' ve stopped time... if just for the blink of an eye.
And if these pictures have anything important to say to future generations, it' s this...
"I was here.
"I existed.
I was happy...
"and someone cared enough about me in this world to take my picture."
How much for this one?
Most people don' t take snapshots of the little things... the used Band- Aid... the guy at the gas station... the wasp on the Jell- O... but these are the things that make up the true picture of our lives.
People don' t take pictures of these things.
Aw, Jake... you really have to tidy up your room, pal.
I bet your mother' s told you a thousand times.
Hey, Chaz.
It' s a good game.
Hi, Sy.
I thought you said you were going out today.
Uncle Sy.
Can you help me put this together?
How many prints would you like of these?
Just one set.
Maya, that' s a very beautiful name.
Thank you.
Have you ever picked up prints here before?
I think maybe once.
It was a long time ago.
Your face looks very familiar.
You work around here?
Sorta near here.
I' ve probably seen you around the mall.
I' m in here pretty often.
Well, we' re a little backed up today.
Is 6: 00 okay?
I probably won' t be able to pick them up till tomorrow or the next day.
See you then.
Thanks.
Come on, a little hustle!
Good shot.
That' s the way to strike the ball.
You gotta get in front of those, son.
Jake, I want you to drill it, all right?
Visualize where you want the ball to go and drill it.
Good one, Jake.
Jake, that' s not good enough.
We' re gonna have to work on that.
Pay attention, fellas.
A little focus.
Drill it in there, Matt.
Good shot.
Next practice, Thursday.
If you can' t make it, be sure and tell Derrick.
Hey, Jake.
Hi.
Toby, you forgot your sweatshirt.
I saw you out there.
I thought I' d check it out.
Jake.
You all right?
Yeah.
Your mom picking you up?
Nah, I got my bike.
That was a great shot you made.
But your coach was a little rough.
I thought he should be more supportive.
Do you want me to have a word with him for you?
Nah, it' s okay.
I will.
No, thanks.
Okay.
I wasn' t very good at sports.
I was kinda chubby kid.
Let' s face it.
I was fat.
I was sick all the time.
Kept comin 'down with mono and hepatitis... and then I broke my collarbone... and I had to wear this weird cast where I kept my arm up like this all winter.
I wasn' t exactly the most popular kid.
How' d you break your collarbone?
Oh, I fell out of a tree.
How' s your dad doing?
Good.
Does he come to see the games?
Yeah, sometimes.
Does he come to see any of the games?
He' s really busy at work.
I don' t know.
He' s -- He' s busy all the time.
He sounds like an important guy.
I guess.
He owns a company and everything.
Probably just wants to make sure that you and your mom have all the nice things you want...
like that cool bike and those soccer shoes.
Hold on.
You know, those things cost money.
He' d be here if he could.
I guess.
I got something for you.
Wanna guess what it is?
What' s wrong?
It' s -- It' s the one you wanted.
Mr. Parrish, I can' t take this.
Sure you can, Jake.
My parents won' t let me.
I' d better be gettin 'back home now.
You sure?
Thanks anyway, Mr. Parrish.
Okay, see you around the store.
Okay.
Hey, Jake.
The name' s Sy.
Okay, Sy.
There' s been, like, some kind of shift.
I don' t know.
A couple of weeks.
Maybe five weeks.
Six.
No, I know that, but...
Um, yeah, but this --
This feels different, you know?
I can' t talk right now.
I' il call you back this afternoon.
Okay.
I know.
I love you, too.
Hi, Sy.
Hi there.
I was just at the Dairy Queen.
I saw you down here and thought I' d say hello.
I' m just grabbing some shopping fuel.
I never see you away from the store.
After all these years, you' d think we' d run into each other at some point.
Why, do you live around here?
I live downtown.
Well, that' s quite a drive.
No, I' m used to it.
You have a nice boy there.
Yeah.
- he likes you, Sy.
He calls you "Sy the photo guy."
You know, I' ve watched him grow since he was this big.
That' s right.
You' ve been doing our pictures for a long time.
You know, I almost feel like "Uncle Sy."
Well, I' ve got some serious shopping to do, Sy.
Oh, sure.
Take care.
Oh, my God.
What?
l -- l -- I' m --
I' m reading that exact book right now.
You' re kidding.
I can' t believe that you' d be reading that book.
You know, he writes a lot about noticing coincidence, doesn' t he?
Yeah, he does.
That thing he says about fear --
"The things we fear the most have already happened to us."
I had no idea you were such a deep thinker, Sy.
I wouldn' t say that.
Do you have any children, Sy?
Me?
No.
I' m not married.
No girlfriend?
No.
I have a snapshot of my mother, though.
She looks very nice.
She' s passed away.
I' m sorry, Sy.
Gosh, you know, I have to go.
Um, it was really nice chatting with you.
It was nice chatting with you.
I' il probably see you very soon.
We can' t seem to go a day without taking a picture of something, so --
Sy Parrish, please see the manager.
Sy to the manager' s office immediately, please.
What' s with the getup, Sy?
It' s Wednesday, Bill.
I was doin 'the SRS.
Sy, there' s been some discrepancies in the click count.
Oh, well, that' s probably Yoshi.
You know, his math skills are pretty weak... but I told you about that when you moved him over from audio.
No, all the discrepancies are on the logs that you initialed.
- They are?
I, you know...
I guess sometimes the end of the week you get a little tired --
We' re not talking about a few innocent math errors, Sy.
They always zero out.
The problem is, Sy, that the shutdown clicks don' t correspond at all.
I mean, they don' t even come close to matching the amount of prints that we sold.
Well, then, it' s probably a problem with the reorder counter.
Well, I asked Larry about that.
What did he say?
Well, he looked at the counter and said that it checked out.
He also said that in 14 years of servicing... he' s never seen a faulty counter on an AGFA unit.
Really?
So the question is, Sy... where did all those unaccounted for prints go?
Well, what kind of discrepancy are we talking about, Bill?
We' re talking about hundreds of prints, Sy.
That' s not possible, Bill.
I' ve done the math... and the P. O. s confirm it, too.
Well, I don' t know anything about it.
Oh, I think you do, Sy.
Well, I don' t, Bill.
Look, Sy, I' ve got a family.
I' m not losing my job over this.
I' m lettin 'you go.
No.
These log discrepancies would be enough... but you' ve been spacing out on the job... taking 90 minute lunch breaks... creating scenes in front of the customers... giving away free merchandise.
What?
Free disposable cameras to customers on their birthday?
That must have been your bright idea.
Sure as shit isn' t company policy.
You can' t do this.
It' s done, Sy.
I talked to Sims at district.
Now you finish out the week and clear out your locker.
And if you do somethin 'like fuck up today' s prints --
I haven' t fucked up a customer' s prints in 11 years.
Just get back out there.
Hey, Sy.
Sy.
Jake wanted to get his birthday gift processed.
I' m sorry?
The camera.
Right.
The birthday gift.
Number of sets?
Oh, just one is fine.
5x7?
Um, the ones we usually get.
Standard.
Jake had a really great time with the camera.
Didn' t you, Jake?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
What was that address again?
It' s 326 Serrano Terrace.
Sy, are you all right?
I' m fine.
I' il have these for you tomorrow.
All right.
Thanks, Sy.
Bye.
Bye.
I' m leaving early today, Yoshi.
Okay, Sy.
I won' t be coming back, Yoshi.
Bill let me go.
You were fired?
Yep.
Really?
Really.
I' ve really enjoyed working with you, Yoshi.
Yeah, me, too, Sy.
Sy?
Sy, I just wanted to, um... well, I guess I just wanted to say thank you, you know?
For what?
For teachin 'me all this stuff.
You' re welcome, Yoshi.
Don' t let the place go downhill, okay?
I won' t, Sy.
Here they are.
Oh, my pictures.
Let me see.
What the hell' s wrong with these people?
The universe grows smaller every day.
There must be security for all... or no one is secure.
It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet.
But if you threaten to extend your violence... this earth of yours will be reduced to a burned- out cinder.
Now, we do not pretend to have achieved perfection.
But we do have a system, and it works.
Your choice is simple: join us and live in peace or pursue your present course and face obliteration.
We shall be waiting for your answer.
The decision rests with you.
According to the Oxford English Dictionary... the word "snapshot" was first used in 1808 by an English sportsman by the name of Sir Andrew Hawker.
He noted in his diary that almost every bird he shot that day was taken by snapshot... meaning a hurried shot taken without deliberate aim.
Can I help you, Sy?
Just dropping off some film.
Just a customer.
I can still shop here, can' t I, Bill?
No, Sy, you can' t still shop here.
- I believe I can, Bill.
I can' t shop here just because I was fired.
I checked it out.
There' s a thousand other places you could do your photos.
There' s no reason to come all the way down here other than to fuck with me.
There' s a very good reason.
I calibrated that machine personally.
It' s the best mini- lab in the state.
All right, Sy.
Just this one time.
But I' m telling you... find another place to do your film.
I do not want you back in here.
Thanks, Bill.
What is it, Yoshi?
leave your station unmanned down there.
I think you need to see these, sir.
What have you got there?
Is it the anal sex fiend again?
Motherfucker.
Mr. Parrish' s demeanor was when he came in?
Demeanor?
Yeah.
How did he seem?
Did he seem upset or agitated in any way?
Um... I don' t know.
He seemed fine.
Sy and I had some words when he came into the store.
Under the circumstances, I was surprised to see him... and I asked him what he was doing here... and I... I suggested in strong language that in the future he bring his pictures somewhere else.
Yoshi, I' m gonna need to make some Xerox copies of this.
Can you show me where I can get that done?
Yeah.
Mr. Owens, why don' t you come and grab a seat and try to calm down?
Your wife and child, they' re, uh... they' re somewhere safe now?
Uh... they' re at my mother' s.
I' m -- I' m sorry.
I' m just a little upset.
No, no, no, no.
It' s...
It' s understandable.
So how did he take his being fired?
I' ve had to fire a lot of people, Detective.
People get upset when they get fired.
He got pretty upset.
He knew that Mr. Araki would see the photos... and he knew he' d show them to you and that you' d call us.
I think it' s just a warning.
But you have to take it seriously.
Oh, we take it very seriously.
Your child' s life has been indirectly threatened.
We take no chances in this county.
There' s an APB out on his white Toyota.
Officers are en route to his apartment now with a search warrant.
I' ve got plainclothes officers on standby inside the store and out.
Now, look... he may come back and pick up his photos.
He may not.
It' s hard to say.
I doubt he will.
You really think that' s a good idea?
I mean, this place is wall- to- wall families.
If he' s stupid enough to come back here... he' il never make it inside the store.
Mr. Parrish, this is the police!
If you' re in the apartment... we need to know right now!
Kill that TV.
Mr. Parrish!
It' s clear.
Officer Lyon.
Double 6, 3- 2- 1.
Go ahead, 3- 2- 1.
I need to be patched through to Van Der Zee in TMU.
Right away, please.
Hey, Dan... take a look at this.
What do you got?
Y- O- R- K- l- N.
I' m sorry, sir.
I don' t find that name registered.
Could you try a Maya Burson?
B- U- R- S- O- N.
Let me check that for you, sir.
I' il ring that room for you now, sir.
Thank you.
Hello?
Hello.
This is room service.
I' m sorry to bother you... but we have your order all ready to go here.
We just needed to know if you' d like coffee with that.
Uh... Will, did you want coffee?
No, just the drinks.
And this is for room 217.
Um... no.
We' re 511, right?
We' re 511.
511.
Oh, my gosh.
I must be looking at the wrong thing here.
I' m sorry.
We' il have it right up to you in just a minute.
Okay, thanks.
Hotel operator.
Room service, please.
One moment, please.
Room service.
This is Jon.
May I take your order please?
Hello, Jon.
This is Will Yorkin in 511.
We' ve decided to go out for lunch.
I was wondering if it' s okay to cancel our order.
No problem.
That was 511, right?
That' s right, Jon.
Thank you very much.
You' re welcome, Mr. Yorkin.
Yes?
Nina Yorkin?
Yes.
Hi.
I' m Detective Van Der Zee of the Evans County Threat Management Unit.
This is Detective Outerbridge.
Threat management?
Is Jake all right?
Everyone' s fine.
We, uh... actually, we need to speak with your husband William.
Will' s at work.
What' s this about?
Do you mind if we come in for a minute?
Sure.
How can I help you, sir?
Hi.
I need a room.
But not too high a foor.
I' il check, sir.
Yes, we can offer you 313.
Anything on 5?
I' il check, sir.
Will Yorkin' s office.
Duane, this is Nina.
I need to talk to Will right now.
He' s not in, Mrs. Yorkin, but I can have him return as soon as he gets back.
Duane, I need you to get him on the phone immediately.
This is an emergency.
Okay.
I' il try him right now.
I' il put you on hold.
No, Duan --
He -- He' s trying right now.
Where' s your son, Mrs. Yorkin?
He' s at his friend Eric' s house.
It might be a good idea to have Eric' s mother drive him home now.
Oh, my God.
Mrs. Yorkin?
Yes, Duane.
There was no answer.
But I left him a 911 pager.
He should call you the second he --
Duane, I know he' s fucking Maya Burson... and I don' t give a shit about that right now.
I just need you to tell me where he is!
Room service.
Can you just leave it outside the door, please?
I' m afraid you have to sign for this.
Uh, just a second.
You --
Get on the bed.
Get on the goddamn bed!
Look, I' ve got plenty of cash in my pants in the wallet in the bathroom --
Shut up!
Close the drapes.
Close them!
Who told you to do that?
I closed the drapes.
Did I tell you to wrap a towel around yourself?
No.
Let me explain what' s going on here.
I tell you to do things, then you fucking do them exactly like I tell you.
I' m gonna tell you this one time and one time only.
You get the picture?
Yeah.
Do you understand me?
Yes.
Good.
Now get on the bed.
- No!
Am I talking to a brick wall?
Did I tell you to touch her?
No.
I don' t want you to touch her.
If you touch her again, I stab you in the heart.
Unit 0- 1 - 1 - 4... proceed to Deerfield, The Edgerton Hotel at Hunter Valley Road.
TMU officers en route to scene.
Can you ring the room once more, please?
I' il try it one more time.
Now, missy, have to take the robe off.
No.
I' m not asking.
I' m telling.
Off!.
She can do it!
The person in this room is not available to take your call.
Please leave a message.
What' s this?
Can' t you stop your sniveling?
This is supposed to look like fun.
No touching!
Smile.
like it' s a game.
Smile!
Wipe your nose.
You look disgusting.
Now... put his thing in your mouth.
Don' t do it!
Pretend.
This is all pretend.
I' m doing it!
Stop yelling at me.
Like this!
Winds churning at their base can exceed 260 miles per hour.
But the scientists chase them.
Tornadoes can be an obsession.
Mr. Belmer?
Yes.
I' m Detective Van Der Zee.
This is Detective Outerbridge.
We just spoke on the phone.
So, uh... what is all this about?
Any word from Miss Burson' s room yet?
No.
Have you seen this man?
This guy just checked in about... half an hour ago.
What room?
I put him in 519.
Mr. Belmer, I need a passkey now, please.
Mr. Parrish, this is the police.
Will you open the door, please?
We owe a --
James.
Let' s find Yorkin.
Check 511.
Bravo, where is it?
Where is it?
It' s the rear kitchen- access.
It' s in the back, rear kitchen- access.
Miss Burson?
Police!
Freeze!
William Yorkin?
Drop the bag!
Do it!
I just took pictures.
You have the right to remain silent.
If you give up the right to remain silent... anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Outerbridge?
We got him.... the right to speak with an attorney and to have the attorney present during questioning.
If you so desire and cannot afford one --
Dad!
Are you married, Detective?
You have any children?
I' il be the one asking the questions here, Sy.
I know.
Just one question.
Detective, are you a family man?
That' s none of your business, Sy.
Sir, you' re right, it isn' t.
It is none of my business.
But I' m guessing by your answer and that ring on your finger that you are... and that makes you a very fortunate man.
I can also tell by the way that you' ve treated me so far and the way you carry out your job, you' re a good man... good husband and father... a man who appreciates his good fortune.
You' re not the type of father who' d cheat on his wife... hurt his family, betray their trust.
You would never neglect and abuse your children.
Make horrible demands of your children.
You would never ask...
you would never ask your children to do things... things that children shouldn' t do.
You would never take disgusting, sick... degraded pictures of your children d -- doing these things.
You would never treat your children like animals.
Will Yorkin had it all, and he threw it all away.
He' s not a good father.
I think I understand now, Sy.
Thank you for answering my question so candidly.
You' re welcome.
Can I see my pictures now?
Sure, Sy.
Thank you.
These were the scenes everyone feared.
... some here have been seriously injured.
... it' s very violent indeed.
Earlier, there was mayhem on the main square...
Getting beaten up by football hooligans is like having VD: the fuckin 'pain goes on forever.
But that' s what makes it so exciting.
So this is me, Tommy Johnson three weeks from now, nearly dead.
And do you know what the funniest thing is?
I could see it coming.
Anyway, it' s almost over now and all that matters is this: was it worth it?
There' s nothing different about me.
I' m just ahother bored male approaching 30, in a dead- end job who lives for the weekend.
Casual sex, watered- down lager, heavily cut drugs.
And occasionally kicking fuck out of someone.
What?
How am I?
What do you mean, "how am I"?
I' m fuckin 'buzzin'!
We' ve gone right through the slit.
Keep your fuckin 'nut down.
He' s a right fuckin 'stringer, this kid.
- What' s he say?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, "nothing"?
- He fuckin 'hung up.
Raff, call Tommy.
Find out where he is.
There' s a pub on the corner called the Ship and Billet.
Head for that.
I' il have to bell you back, Harris is trying to get through.
Just spotted their little firm going to a pub in Denbigh Street.
They won' t know what' s fuckin 'hit' em.
There you are.
Here, come here!
- Sweet, Bill?
- Yeah.
- Where' s the others?
- On their way.
- Harris said there' s about 25 of the others.
- There won' t be when we' ve finished with 'em.
Wait round the corner!
What for?
Cos it' s all going to be on top, us all standin 'here, you si.
- Jog on.
- Jog on!
Bill, it' s Harris.
Hello, son.
Yeah?
All right.
See you there.
What happened to you last night?
Thought you was coming out for a drink?
Johnson had me on some nutty skunk.
Ended up down the petrol garage at two o' clock in the morning.
What you driving for?
You' re on a ban, you lunatic.
Ban?
What am I gonna do, walk?
Here he is.
Right, there' s someone outside the pub.
- How old is he?
- He' s only a kid.
Keep the noise down.
Keep the noise down.
- Excuse me, mate, you got a light?
- Don' t fuck about, ping him.
Let' s go!
It' s going good anyway.
Let' s settle it.
- Come on, let' s...
- Keep it down, keep it down.
- Keep it down.
- Fuckin 'hell, come on, boys.
Keep it down, keep it down.
- Come on.
Fuckin 'hell.
- Keep it down.
Don' t fuck this up.
Fuckin 'clowns won' t stop us.
You' re fuckin 'animals!
You give this fuckin 'country a bad fuckin' name!
You ain' t no football supporters!
You' re fuckin 'muggy little cunts!
What else are you gonna do on a Saturday?
Sit in your fuckin 'armchair wankin' off to Pop Idols?
Then try and avoid your wife' s gaze as you struggle to come to terms with your sexless marriage?
Then go and spunk your wages on kebabs fruit machines and brasses?
Fuck that for a laugh!
I know what I' d rather do.
Tottenham away.
Love it!
How fuckin 'perfect was that?
Soppy bollocks here even managed to get the canister inside the fuckin 'pub this time.
Do you remember that time at Upton...
That time at Upton Park, he let it off on the tube!
Mind you, premature ejaculation, that' s right up your fuckin 'street!
Anyway, he' s virtually throwing 'em out of the fuckin' pub at me, right?
Crunch!
I hit this geezer so fuckin 'hard, his legs went like a fuckin' baby giraffe.
State of that.
I done me knuckles.
So hit people in the mouth, not the back of the fuckin 'head.
Just as well I did or you' d be in hospital, you cunt.
No- one loved Chelsea more than me and Rod.
We grew up on football terraces together with my old man.
He knew the score.
The first bit of advice he give me was:
You know what to do if someone tries to clump you?
Kick him in the fuckin 'bollocks.
Me and Rod did everything together.
Hurry up, Tom, I' m starving.
It took me an hour just to find it.
Still Rod didn' t need to know that.
She ain' t walkin 'for a week.
My grandad old Bill Farrell, drove us to drink with his stories about the war and how he fought to put the Great into Britain.
He said fighting at football was nothing compared to the Germans.
"We' il fight them on the beaches, we' il fight them on the..."
Although he went on, he was right.
We' re an island race.
It' s what we do best.
It' s not about colour or race, it' s just the buzz of being in the front line.
Truth is, I just love to fight.
There' s nothing wrong with me... unlike Billy Bright, whose dad had a funny way of setting a good example for his son.
Right, that' s it.
I' il fight every one of you before you move on next door to us.
Come on, son!
With parents like that, he was never gonna end up in Greenpeace.
Still he was one of the first football thugs to see there was a fortune to be made from England' s love for ecstasy.
Oi, three bottles of Bud, please, mate.
Problem was he' d taken so many beatings on the terraces that he weren' t scared of anyone.
And the correct medical term for that is a "total fuckin 'psycho".
Bill, let' s get out of here.
There' s about ten Stoke fans staring at us.
- How many of 'em did you say there was?
- About ten.
Please don' t start, Bill.
- Right, which one of them' s staring at me.
- The big geezer with the Hackett cap on.
See you, you cunt.
I' il cut you first.
And that was his idea of a good day out.
But underneath the fun and games and Range Rovers, Biliy was bitter, cos he hever got to run our firm.
Harris was top boy and that was that.
He was smarter than Billy and ran things like an army unit.
Deep down Billy knew he' d never be leader and because of that he hated Zeberdee.
Why?
Simple...
Zeberdee looked up to Harris and not him.
And the more Zeberdee looked up to Harris, the more Billy bullied him.
And what chance did Zeberdee have as a kid, brought up in a concrete jungle on glue and hate?
I don' t envy the young 'uns any more.
It' s a nightmare.
Warfare from the playground upwards and you know what you have to do to survive in combat.
Just like me and Rod, him and Raff are best mates, only difference being they' re thieving little cunts.
In case you' re wondering, we call him Zeberdee cos he loves sniffin 'powder.
And one dayn it' il be his downfall.
Hold your hand out, Raff.
- What?
- Hold your hand out.
You' re just a fuckin 'kid, ain' t you?
Hold your hand out, Bill.
Do what?
Hold it out like Raff and we' il see how old you are.
No, let' s have it right.
You trying to mug me off?
Oh, shut up.
I' m only fuckin 'about an' that.
- What?
What d' you mean, "what"?
You know, just...
Well, don' t fuckin 'just.
Leave it out.
You trying to wind me up?
Ain' t trying to wind anyone up.
I' m fuckin 'serious.
What I want to know is, what makes you think you can come in here and mug me off in front of my pals?
I didn' t mean nothing by it, Bill.
It was only a bubble, that' s all.
Just a bubble?
What you talking to me in that fuckin 'muggy rhyming slang for?
I never fuckin 'liked you, you little cunt.
You' re a wrong 'un, just like your old man.
He was a degenerate fuckin 'drunk.
Do you know what I' m thinking?
I' m thinking I should take you outside and open you up.
- Leave it out, Bill.
- Leave what fuckin 'out?
What, d' you wanna get involved an 'all, do you?
Don' t be stupid.
I' m just saying, he' s only a kid.
No, let' s have it right, Tom.
If he' s old enough to run round givin 'it large, fuckin' bashing people up with us, he' s old enough to talk for himself.
I' il tell you something, Zeberfuckindee,
I think I should take you outside and teach you a lesson for mugging me off and making me look a cunt in front of my fuckin 'pals.
I...
I didn' t say nothing.
Come on, outside, you little fuckin 'stumblebum.
Leave it out, eh?
Stop mutterin 'and stutterin' and fuckin 'liven yourself up.
I fuckin 'had you there!
Fuckin 'hell, Zeb, you should have seen your fuckin' face.
I thought you was gonna burst into tears.
What is it, four, five... eight lagers, Donna, please, babe.
There' il be none of this in Australia.
As of next week, strictly the amber nectar.
Not to worry, William.
I think I' m more of a cocktail man anyway.
Well, I won' t be sitting next to you.
Well, that was the idea.
Bill, Albert, I didn' t see you there.
Wanna pint?
My grandad didn' t like Bright.
Knew he was a bully.
Bill and Albert were just kids when they did their National Service.
They were one of the first off the landing crafts on June 6th.
Bill aways told me the only thing that kept him going was Albert' s determination and will to live.
They came home proud war heroes and married their childhood sweethearts.
And buried 'em together as well.
The council moved Albert to the flat above Bill and they swapped door keys, always vowing to keep an eye on each other.
Very funny.
Very, very funny!
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Now a little one.
Now a little one.
That' s it, now let me get the door.
Let me get the door.
I' il be right in there.
Comfy?
Do you want any help with that?
Yeah.
Bit different nowadays, though, innit, eh?
Gone.
It' s the Pakis coming over in the '70s, see.
Taking over everything.
Spoilt it.
And what you got now, eh?
What you got now?
Fuckin 'asylum seekers.
Bloody Tony fuckin 'Blair.
He' s gotta be a poof, ain' t he?
New Labour?
I mean, and this game' s gone.
There was a time I used to be able to clear seven and a half, eight hundred shots a week.
Nah.
Now what you got is your fuckin 'spades up in Soho moonlighting!
Moonlighting!
Fuck' s sake, that' s a joke!
You need a full moon just to see 'em!
This country was built on good people like yourselves.
Not enough of you about, that' s what I say.
Here, let me give you a hand with that.
Swing your old arse round in there, look.
That' s it, lovely.
And I just want to say, it' s been a privilege to drive two gentlemen like you.
And the fare' s on me.
Don' t be silly.
You' re letting the wheelchair fool you.
No, I insist.
It' s been an honour.
Don' t forget, you watch out for them darkies, eh?
Let' s go dancing.
Although he talked a lot of bollocks, in some ways the cabbie was right.
Bill was what put the Great into Britain.
He was an old war hero.
But he' d moved on.
It was Australia for him and Albert now.
Somewhere they could live out the rest of their days in the sun.
Hello, Mavis, my little darling.
How are you?
I shall be sad to see you both gone, Bill.
Are you packed up yet?
Course we have.
Ain' t you gonna say goodbye?
Can' t you do better than that.?
What are you talking about, Bill?
Don' t you know?
You fucking disgusting old man!
That' s what I loved about Bill.
He was still game.
Living abroad for years and how his time had come.
I even give him and Albert a little treat for going away.
My grandson gave me a going- away present.
A joint of his very best home- grown.
You mean drugs?
Yeah, well, you light up old, son.
I' il make do with this.
It' s amazing to think in a couple of weeks we' il be watching the sun go down on the other side of the world.
And it won' t be surrounded by tower blocks.
Miles of golden sand and bronze tits.
You packed yet?
Haven' t given it a thought.
My case has been packed and sitting inside the front door for three days.
You want to get your skates on, Farrell.
Oh, stop nagging, you old woman.
- You know what Bert?
- What' s that?
I' m feeling dizzy.
You always were, you dozy bastard!
I must be in with half a chance.
Especially as I' d fuck anything that' s breathing.
I tell you, I' m fuckin 'mullered, me.
I am fuckin 'mullered.
Look at the fuckin 'boat on it.
Imagine that round your fuckin 'helmet.
No, no, no, Tom.
Proper fuckin 'slosh pots.
Shut up, you...
What' s the matter with you?
All right, sweetheart?
You all right, girl, yeah?
- All right?
- Do you want a drink?
A few tequilas?
A couple of little cheeky tequilas, yeah?
Shall we get on it?
- A little cheeky tequila...?
- Tequilas.
Get these two birds here a couple of tequilas.
I' m gonna smash the fuckin 'granny out of that.
All the good people, right, all the good people... are being forced into the suburbs, due to the influx of illegal immigrants forcing their way into this country.
- I mean...
- Hey, mate.
Mate, will you shut your fuckin 'noise?
You fuckin 'cunt.
Get up there, girl.
Get up there.
I cannot wait to fuckin 'see your fanny.
I' m gonna fuckin 'ruin you...
- Let' s have a butcher' s here.
Rod, look.
- Smash you in the...
- Look at that.
Beautiful, beautiful.
He' s only fallen asleep, Tameka.
Same here, Shian.
Little fuckers.
Shame.
He' s hung like a pike in here.
Good for you.
I' ve got a stickleback in here.
You fuckin 'little mug!
How dare you come into my fuckin 'gaff, and try and get hold of my little sister against her will?
You' re in bandit country now, boy, no- one will even know you were fuckin 'here.
There' s holes dug all over South London for people like you.
Jesus.
But instead, I get some nutter in a Stone Island jumper and a blade in my face.
And worst of all, that was where all the trouble started.
Oi, silly bollocks.
What are these?
What?
- What are they?
- Flowers.
- What sort of flowers, dinlow?
- Lilies.
Then what are they doing with the chrysanths?
All right.
Sorry.
- What?
- Er... there' s someone here to see you, Bill.
Left her watching Blind Date.
He' s given me a couple of Es.
I' ve had them with a bit more thingy, and wound up copping for two slosh pots out of Chigwell.
Smashed the granny out of the pair of 'em in the Tower Hotel till eleven, Sunday morning.
Yeah, I was back home in time for a Sunday roast, but I was completely fuckin 'anninilated.
Look, I' ve got to go, mate.
My man' s here.
Ta- da.
Good to see you, son.
- How are you?
All right?
- Not bad.
Heard you Chelsea boys had a little turnout at Tottenham at the weekend.
You ain' t wrong.
Heard you Millwall boys had a little turnout down in Pompey.
We did.
We should have had a meet.
Would have been fun.
You know where to find us.
Any time you like.
Your time' il come.
What have you got for me?
One thing I never understood about Bright was, although he was in the Chelsea firm, he did business with the head of their rivals.
Millwall.
Get that.
Two men that work together, then kick fuck out of each other if ever they get the chance.
It' s bang on.
What you got round you?
Four K.
- Go on, then.
I' il take the lot.
- Cash.
Hang on.
Hang on.
Slow down.
What?
You' re fuckin 'joking!
All right.
I' il go straight up the hospital.
Yeah 'see you there.
- Problem, Fred?
- It' s my brother, Terry.
Someone' s just done him round the canister with a cricket bat.
You' re fuckin 'joking?
Is he all right?
They don' t know yet.
Look, I gotta go.
- I' il keep this lot on ice for you.
- I' il call you later.
Oi!
What are you fuckin 'doing?
You' re three hours late.
Don' t start, mate.
I' ve had a bit of ag.
What you got a sheet on for?
You don' t wanna know.
You' re right, I don' t.
Get in and sort them dinlows out.
They' re putting lilies in with the chrysanths.
You got anything on under there?
What am I fuckin' paying for?
Just get on with it
- What do you reckon, fat boy?
- You look like a vicar, mate.
Are you fuckin 'mad?
This is Prada, you cunt.
It' s iron' s gear.
Get your fuckin 'skates on.
We gotta get there for the draw.
Horrible cunt.
What about the draw?
How are we gonna find a telly to watch it?
Oh, there' il be tellies where we' re going.
Oi, Zeb, try and make sure we' ve got a decent house to rob this time, will you?
I don' t want to watch some piece of shit.
Slow down, will you, Davis, eh?
What' s the matter with you?
Are you a fuckin 'Hoover?
Whether we were thieving, fucking or fighting tonight, we' d a be glued to a TV set to see who Chelsea drew in the Cup.
See, the beauty of the Cup draw is, it' s a lucky dip, a chance to meet one of the old rivals, like Cardiff or West Ham, or if you' re really lucky, Millwall.
And cos the draw meant so much to Billy, he decided to take his long- suffering wife Barbara out for a quiet, romantic meal.
However, they got their wires crossed, cos Barbara thought he was taking her up the West End for some tapas.
Let' s see what' s on the menu.
Oh, what, your girfriend?
Either turn that TV up, or tell that lot down there to hold their noise down.
Calm down, Bill.
We don' t want to cause a scene.
No.
No, you' re right.
- The old rubber glove!
- The old rubber glove, mate.
Oi.
Will you shut up?
I' m trying to watch the fuckin 'telly!
... against 52.
Southend United.
57.
Portsmouth.
Will pay number 38.
Middlesbrough.
Number 22.
Millwall.
Will pay 44.
Chelsea.
Yes!
Fuckin 'yes!
Another battle then.
Eh?
Can' t fuckin 'hear you.
Who is it, for fuck' s sake?
Yes!
- Who, who, who?
- It' s fuckin 'Millwall!
Millwall- Chelsea.
Old enemies that always ends up in murders.
Literally in my case, cos like a mug I thought I' d get lucky in the same bar again.
And I see my new mate again who, of course, turns out to be Millwall.
Maybe I should ask him if I fucked his sister, seeing as I can' t remember.
If I' d listened to my instincts and laid low, none of this mess would have happened but I didn' t, and I only had myself to blame.
And occasionally, and I do mean occasionally, it would be nice to have Bright out with us.
It' s typicla that tonight he' s taken his wife out for a quiet one.
See?
He does have a gentle side.
Zeb and Raff missed the draw cos they were doing what they do best - robbing houses, something they' d later come to regret.
Me, I' m beginning to get the feeling old Magic Johnson' s lost his touch.
Drive, mate!
Fuckin 'drive.
I' m being chased!
Lost his touch?
Bollocks.
Hard to have a nice night out in London, eh?
I blame all the black s and fun pubs, myself.
Shut up mate.
You' re boring.
Welcome back to BBC London Sport with me, Danny Kelly.
Now, anyone who' s listened to the Breakfast Show will have heard Danny Baker going on about his great excitement about the prospects of Millwall and Chelsea here in London.
Our reporter, as always, is Pete Stevens.
That' s right, Danny.
I' m sure there' s going to be a vast police presence to keep the we- known hooligan elements apart from these two teams.
I only hope I' m not given the job of reporting live from South London.
I' d much rather be watching the game from the comfort of my front room.
Well, come on, Albert, you old bastard!
We' il miss our flight.
All right, Bill?
You look pissed off.
No, I' m not fuckin 'all right.
Some cunt burgled my house last night.
Hold that.
Suddenly, going to Millwall weren' t so appealing, now I knew my enemies were part of their firm
It' s the one fuckin 'place on earth I didn' t want to be caught out<. / i>
Anyway, Liverpool away, and a chance to have a good sleep on the coach.
- What did they nick, Bill?
- TV, DVD...
Even took the fuckin 'kids' PlayStation and my mobile.
- Your mobile?
- Yeah.
You know what to do?
Ring your number and see if they' ve still got it.
That' il freak 'em out.
Tell them you know where they live and that.
Good call, Rods.
I' ve got that Ride Of The Valkyries ring tone.
You know, the war cry.
That' il fuckin 'freak' em out.
Hello?
You are fuckin 'dead meat.
I didn' t know it was your house.
I didn' t know it was your house!
Look, I' ve got all the gear.
I' ve got the PlayStation.
I' il shall fuckin 'open you up!
Fuck.
Where are you from, mate?
Just around.
Are you fookin 'Chelsea?
Yeah.
You flash cockney bastards.
Do you know Stanley?
Run!
Drive on again mate.
Drive on.
Hey!
Stop the fuckin 'bus, you cunt!
Fuckin 'come on!
Where the fuck are you running now?
Cunts!
Fuckin 'cunts!
Fuck off!
Come here.
You didn' t fuckin 'shine there, did you, son?
What?
I' ve got to go to work on him now, stop him opening you up.
You silly bollocks.
What was all that about?
But we did 'em, didn' t we, H?
Billy had a real punishmeht lined up for Zeberdee.
He weren' t the forgiving type, but as long as Harris was around, he couldn' t touch him.
And Harris and Billy certainy didn' t need another reason to fall out.
No thieving.
No bringing attention to yourselves.
Just keep your nuts down.
I want you to be outside and back on the road in five minutes.
Oh, yeah, and whatever you do, no fighting.
Bit rich, coming from him, innit?
Zeb, what did Billy say to you?
He said we' ve got to get his gear back to him by tomorrow.
And we' ve got to apologise to his wife and kids.
You' ve had a result there.
He could have battered you.
Blinding result, eh?
This complete nutter will never talk to us again, and everyone think s we' re thieving little cunts.
You are thieving little cunts.
But you know what you' ve got to do, don' t you?
Prove yourself at Millwall.
That' il sort it out.
Yeah, do the business down there, and you' il be an hero in his eyes.
Will you stop moaning about beer?
All you do is complain about beer.
I' il be opening bottles with my fuckin 'teeth all the way up there, Bill.
Could have done with a couple of cans.
Shouldn' t have had that chicken burger.
Stone me, it' s them Stoke fans that done us.
- Where?
- Over there.
It' s them.
- It is them.
- It is an 'all.
On the Rory, on the Rory, on the Rory.
Listen.
We' il get the beers safe.
Then we' il outflank 'em, yeah?
I ain' t saying a word.
What the fuck are you doing?
There' s two of them Stoke fans that done us.
Drop 'em now.
We' il be late for the meet.
Fuck 'em.
They kicked the shit out of us.
No.
The gavvers are over there.
I' il give you fuckin '"no"!
Fuckin 'idiots.
Slow down, you two, for fuck' s sake!
What, was you fuckin 'bullied at school, was you?
Have fun, boys.
Who are you fuckin 'looking at?
Billy' s extensive vocabulary would never get him into Parliament.
And this lot could be West Ham, Cardiff, Arsenal, Stoken even Man Uhited.
Don' t matter to me.
The odds don' t look very good.
Know what?
I think I' il call it a night.
Tom?
Yeah, let' s go and have a beer.
Yeah, good idea.
We' il jog on.
What about you, Tom?
All right, boys.
I' il see you in a bit.
Order us some Miller.
- Light?
- Er... regular.
- No problem.
- See you later.
You all right down there, mister?
What happened to you?
I' ve had the shit kicked out of me.
What about you?
Me?
I' m dead.
Bill!
Rod!
Help!
Where are you?
Bill!
Help!
Fuckin 'hell.
Liven yourself up.
We' re in court in half an hour.
Court?
What?
Fuck...
What about my dream?
What the fuck was that dream a about?
Who was the pikey kid with the bandaged face?
Where was that tunnel?
What did i all mean?
Fuck it.
Must be that nutty skunk again.
What' s wrong with you, Bright?
You' re 40 years old, and still you offend persistently.
I see children with more common sense.
What did you say?
Don' t you dare answer me with that insolent tongue of yours, you fat fucking slob!
The Establishment call us chidren while they' re at King' s Cross having sex with 'em.
I should tell this old queer to join us down at Millwall.
He might enjoy swapping that silly wig for having a row.
Yes, sir.
I' m very sorry, sir.
It won' t happen again, sir.
You can be sure of that.
I do hope that' s the case, Mr Bright.
I' m passing this over for reports.
I' il see you in a month for sentence.
- And Bright - Yes, sir?
I won' t hesitate to give you a custodial sentence of a least five years...
Rod' s slipping into the court clerk?
What' s he got I' m missing?
Shame.
He' s hung like a pike in here.
And it' s tricky cos he' s been known to get serious.
How are the tulips selling?
They flew out at the market.
What' s happening, Tom?
Here.
I got nicked with Bright the other day, kicking off with the OB.
You' d have loved it.
Nice one, Tom.
Sounds really clever.
It' s not my scene any more.
Yeah, well, I' m just saying.
Well, go and say it somewhere else, and don' t come down my stall giving it the big 'un.
All right.
Slow down, Ad.
Slow down?
I' il tell you about fuckin '"slow down".
What' s the matter with you, clumping people?
Ain' t it about time you started growing up?
You' re nearly 30.
You wanna get hold of yourself.
It' s all a lot of bollocks, anyway.
- What?
- You' re a bright kid.
Work it out.
- Here you are.
- No, they' re from both of us.
Tommy... think about it.
Nearly 30?
What' s he on about?
Jesus!
I only wanted a bunch of fuckin 'flowers, and he tells me to think about my life.
See you, Albert.
What' s Harris and Bright doing there?
I could hardly stop them, Bill.
They' re foolish men, Tom.
Harris think s we' re connected cos I fought in the war.
What he doesn' t understand is, I fought to stop people like him with their Fascist opinions.
Billy is a fuckin 'idiot.
Are you still going to Australia?
I don' t know.
There' s a spare ticket going begging, if you' re interested.
Your cousins would love to see you.
Do yourself a favour.
Put a bit of distance between you and all that stuff you' re mixed up in.
I' m all right, Bill.
I' m just having a laugh.
Well, just be careful.
Next time you visit the boneyard, it could be in a box.
What are you fuckin 'doing here, you little cunt?
I' ve cme to pay my respects.
Well, you' re not wanted.
Let' s have it right.
You didn' t even fuckin 'know him, did you?
Did you?
Well, put your soppy cap on, then, and fuck off.
Go on, jog on.
Don' t forget our appointment.
All right, boys?
What' s happening?
Why have you got a dartboard drawn on your shirt, Zeb?
Well, what' s it got to do with you, you mug?
All right, boys.
First one to a hundred.
Stand up straight.
He wants to know which one stole the PlayStation.
Me.
Good call.
Crack on.
Oi, shithead, hold your hand out.
- What, Zeb?
- I said, hold your hand out.
Just a kid, ain' t you?
You hold your hand out, Zeb.
Let' s see how old you are.
Are you trying to fuckin 'mug me off?
With Millwall round the corner, it was time for the juniors to play
Nice to see Billy and Fred could put their differences aside when it come to their kids.
Bit of a coincidence, eh?
Our kids play against each other just before we meet in the Cup.
Somehow, I don' t think this game' s gonna get quite as messy.
Do you?
Fancy yourselves in bandit country, then?
Well, let' s have it right.
last time we met you lot, we ran you all over London.
You couldn' t run 100 yards, mate!
- Won' t fuckin 'need to, either!
- Don' t get lemon, Bill.
It don' t suit you.
Spell it, you cunt.
C- U- N- T. Cunt.
I meant "lemon", soppy bollocks.
We' il see about lemon when you' re lost in deep south, you fat fuckin 'prick.
Now we' re getting personal.
Now, what' s your problem?
That you have to open your kebab shop soon or that you buy Charlie off a white man?
Well, how does it feel doing business with a Turk, when you' re supposed to be right wing?
Scooby- Do' s less confused than you.
You' il be confused when I open your canister up.
You wanna wait till the game or make one now?
Don' t punch above your weight, you long streak of piss.
Well, stop punching your old woman about, then, wanker.
What did you fuckin 'say, you mug?
You fuckin 'heard, you fat fuckin' Johnson cunt.
Fuckin 'mug!
Look at you, you cunt!
Get off me, you...
Get off me, you cunt!
Fuck this.
If they can' t be grown up, let' s go.
I' il fuckin 'do you!
Just as I thought.
Rod' s been plating the court clerk' s Gary, and now she wants to meet his mates.
I told him I already met her in the dock, but he insisted on a social one.
And why is it that when your best mate meets a girl, he quickly changes into a fuckin 'melt, 703 00: 45: 51, 840 -- > 00: 45: 54, 912 and acts like he' s only known you for ten minutes?
So... what do you do, then, Thomas?
Thomas?
Kick people' s fuckin 'heads in for a laugh.
And you shoud know, div.
You read the charges out.
Me?
I work long and hard.
Sounds like Rod!
- Yeah?
Jesus, he' s really picked one here.
The worst sort of all.
Wannabe middle- class scum.
I' d like to kick the cunt back to Penge.
Seems nice.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, he' s a top bloke.
Bill, it' s Tom.
Fancy a quiet drink?
I' m bored out of my skull.
Meet me at work around seven in the morning.
Don' t worry.
I' il bring my tools.
- Fancy a sauna?
- Good call, Bill.
Johnson!
Johnson!
All right, Billy.
What' s it gonna be today?
A little lavender head massage?
No, forget that and just crack straight on with the blow job, eh?
Stone me, she won' t be working for a week.
What was that screaming about?
- What do you think?
- Good boy.
What do you think the screaming was about?
I' m having a fuckin 'breakdown.
With my back against the wall there was only one thing for it - seek counsle from Bright.
Bill, can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah, yeah, course you can, son.
It' s just er...
I keep...
I dunno.
I just keep...
You know?
Yeah, yeah, I know.
- Really?
- Yeah, I know.
Fuck!
Fuck it.
I thought it was just me.
No, listen.
It happens to me all the time.
No, don' t worry about it.
It' s sweet.
Don' t worry.
I' m gonna sort you out.
Thank s, Bill.
You' re a fuckin 'good man.
Listen.
Don' t mention it.
- Here you are.
Go on son.
Crack on.
Go on.
Enjoy!
Should have seen that one coming.
Ask Bright for advice, and you get fuckin 'Viagra.
And what a good mate he was in my time of need.
Fuckin 'fat little cunt lazing about with his Penge minge.
Wake up, sleepy.
That was my parents on the phone.
They' re coming to London at the weekend and want to take us out.
Well, as long as it ain' t Saturday.
We got Millwall.
It is Saturday, Rod.
What about Sunday?
They' re going to my brother' s in Reading.
Don' t tell me you' d rather go to football.
Well, I am male.
It' s one game.
I am male.
But my parents only come round once every few months.
Yeah, Millwall comes round less than the eclipse, babe.
Well, don' t just run out.
- I' m going to work.
- Let' s talk about it, eh?
There' s nothing to talk about.
You either meet my parents on Saturday or you never meet them.
All right, boys?
Yeah.
Sweet.
Speak to you later.
Fuck off.
- Are you serving?
- Yeah, what do you need?
Whites or browns?
Hit him, hit him!
Hit the cunt.
Come here.
Cunt!
Cunt!
Cunt!
Grab the fuckin 'rock.
Come on.
Let' s go.
Let' s go.
Let' s go.
Cunt!
Come on!
- Fuckin 'hell!
- Shit, that must have been Zeberdee.
Come, let' s go.
My grandad' s life was disappearing in front of his eyes.
With Albert dead, he had no- one, apart from me, so it was time to give him some family support, and maybe even some friendly advice.
You should come to Millwall at the weekend.
That' il liven you up a bit.
You all right for money, Bill?
Cos you know you' ve only got to ask.
I' m earning a few quid down the market now.
It ain' t as if I got a bird to spend it on.
Unlike Rod.
You sound over the moon about that.
Yeah, well...
Your chance' il come.
Don' t you ever get the itch?
Yeah.
I can see myself on a sun lounger in my back garden, a couple of kids running about... sipping my Pimm' s quietly.
Kids, eh?
Yeah.
Why not?
What' s their names?
Dorian, after my mate.
Dorian?
Both of them?
Yeah, probably.
What if they' re girls?
Dorian.
You' re a good boy, Tom.
Keep your eye on my wallet, Bill.
I' m going to the toilet.
I tell you what, Fred.
This area beats South London hands down.
Bollocks, does it.
I' il have Bermondsey any day.
It' s full of spivs and skint hoorays round here.
I just wanna find this fuckin 'Tommy Johnson and get out of here.
Let' s just cut him and fuck off back over south.
You' re not wrong.
Oi, you, skint boat, come here.
- Me?
- Yes, fuckin 'you.
Come here.
Come on.
Ever heard of a geezer called Tommy Johnson?
Johnson...
Johnson...
No, I' ve never heard of him, mate.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So, what' s your name?
- What?
- I said, what' s your fuckin 'name?
Dorian.
Poof!
Dorian?
Sounds like a fuckin 'poof.
Yeah, I know.
Just a name, though, innit?
Prove it.
Prevve wmnat?
Stop fuckin 'stuttering, and fuckin' prove it.
Just show him some fuckin 'brief.
Er...
I ain' t got my wallet on me, mate.
Go on, then.
Go on.
Hang on.
We' il see who the fuck you really are.
Give us your phone.
Who' s this?
Hello.
It' s Rod.
Is Dorian there?
You' ve had a fuckin 'touch.
Little mug.
Come on.
Let' s go.
Do you reckon he' s somewhere else?
We' il try the other gaff.
He' s got to be here somewhere.
Fuckin 'hell!
Did your arse drop, son?
You' d fuckin 'think so!
I tell you.
The moment I seen them follow you in, I knew you' d give them a dodgy name.
It' s a little trick we picked up in the army.
Dorian.
- Dorian.
- Dorian.
See you, Rodder, I fuckin 'love you sometimes.
Do you know that?
You ain' t too bad yourself, Johnson.
I' m well up for it now.
The omens are good.
Millwall who?
I' m gonna have a right fuckin 'buzz down there.
Yeah.
Don' t say it, Rod.
What?
You fuckin 'know.
Look, Tom, fuckin '...
Her mum and dad are coming down.
Tom, you' il need these where you' re going.
Not good.
You?
Still dead.
Sorry about that.
Am I?
No, you' re still alive.
- Who are you, mate?
- Don' t know mate.
Can' t tell till I take these bandages off.
What?
What do you mean, "what"?
What are you looking at me like that for?
You don' t know?
What, Rod?
You don' t remember what you done last night?
I was fuckin 'lashed, wasn' t I?
Last thing I remember was being in the boozer with you and my grandad.
Jesus, Tom...
For fuck' s sake, Rod, what' s so bad?
You don' t remember Barbara?
Barbara who?
You tried to get off with Billy' s wife.
Fuck off.
And when she blanked you, you beat her up.
- What?
- You broke her fuckin 'jaw, Tom.
I know you' re winding me up, Rod.
Please tell me you' re winding me up, Rod.
I ain' t, mate.
Fuck off, King.
I tell you what.
I' il ring Zeb.
He' il fuckin 'know.
All right, Zeb?
Fuckin 'hell, Tom.
I don' t know what to say.
You went berserk mate.
I' ve got to wash my hands of this one.
The cunt' s been playing darts with me.
What am I gonna do, Rod?
You' re gonna have to go round there.
What?
Just go round there and fuckin 'beg.
Well, that' s a good idea.
I might as well break her fuckin 'nose while I' m at it.
I don' t know what else to say to you, Tom.
No, you' re right.
I' Il...
I' il fling myself on my knees and let him kick the fuck out of me.
Hopefully, he' il have mercy on me if I' m on the floor.
You know him better than me, mate.
That' s the problem.
I know what he' il do.
Johnson.
Listen, Bill, listen.
On my life, I don' t remember nothing.
I was obviously smashed out of my tree.
I' m none the wiser, Bill.
Please, Bill.
I don' t know what' s gone on, mate swear to you.
Please Bill.
Please.
My life.
You soppy, muggy streak of piss.
I can' t fuckin 'believe you fell for that!
If you' d touched my woman, you' d already be dead!
Fuckin 'arseholes.
Fuckin 'funny, that, innit?
Have a fuckin 'laugh, will you?
Really fuckin '...
I really fuckin 'need this at the moment, what with my dreams, fuckin' florists, fuckin 'billboards...
Bollocks!
Cunts.
On his fuckin 'knees!
With mates like mine you certainly don' t need enemies.
Jesus.
But now, with Millwall round the corner, I' m half the man I was, which ain' t saying much.
And the worst is yet to come.
Here' s Mark with the sport.
Well, the third round takes place this Saturday, and of course the pick of the ties has got to be Chelsea against Millwall.
I know police leave is cancelled, but this goes beyond that.
This is that ancient rivalry...
Hello, Bill.
Donna, give him a pint, love.
Put 'em on the tab.
- How' s your luck?
- Not bad, Billy.
How are you?
Right.
Same as before.
I' il take some of you lot down through South Bermondsey, and Tommy will take the rest from Surrey Quays.
Where' s the meet?
It can' t be too far away.
They' il have spotters out all over the place.
- And it' s on top of the Old Bill before we start.
- What about Billy?
What about Billy?
He knows Millwall like the back of his hand.
Fuck Billy.
He don' t know what he' s doing any more.
Now, let' s have it right.
We all know he' s become a liability.
But he can' t run a turnout down in South London.
He' s a fuckin 'lunatic.
Look what happened in Liverpool.
Bollocksed the day up.
His problem is, he' s taken too much of that shit up his nose.
Just forget him.
Slow down.
He' s one of your own.
Hang on.
You' ve got to make Harris right here.
It' s like having a big kid around.
He' s a fuckin 'dope, mate.
Just let him take Zeberdee and those chavvies.
That' il do him.
You just wipe your mouth of him.
He' s a spent force.
Bill...
Bill!
What' s the matter, babe?
You think I' m all right, don' t you?
What?
I' m all right, aren' t I?
Yeah, course you are, you silly sod.
Come here.
Eat your dinner.
Bright!
Don' t fuckin 'creep up on me like that, you si!
Take it easy.
How comes you weren' t down the pub last night?
Fell asleep, didn' t I?
How comes you know I weren' t there?
Harris belled me and asked where you were.
Well, he didn' t fuckin 'bell me.
Maybe he forgot, eh?
- Got it?
What' s that for?
Millwall.
Don' t be stupid.
You can' t take a gun down there.
- It' s only a flare gun.
- What are you on about?
You' il kill someone.
Meant to be having a laugh aren' t we?
Fuckin 'hell, Bill.
You' re on the turn, ain' t you?
- You ain' t got nothing to prove.
- Ain' t I?
You look as handsome as you did on our wedding day.
Where are your medals?
You can' t go to Whitehall without them, dear.
You' re a hero William.
Go and put them on dear.
Make me the proudest woman alive.
Don' t look at me.
Fuck off, you Pakis.
Fuck off!
Got the little chavvy?
Corned beefs all over the gaff.
I know, I know, I know.
Did you see the state of his boat?
Did you see it?
You don' t even know you' re fuckin 'born!
Oh, fuck off.
I know who I am now.
Show me, then.
Hurry up, lazy bollocks.
It' s Millwall today.
You all right?
I' m sweet, mate.
I' m fuckin 'buzzing.
This is it.
What' s wrong?
You look like you' ve seen a ghost.
Listen, Zeb.
Listen, listen.
You...
You' d better just...
What, Tom?
Fucking hell, Tom, what had I better do?
Just look after yourself.
It might turn ugly.
Don' t worry about me.
I' m gonna be a fuckin 'hero.
Liven up, we' ve got to meet the others.
Here, Tom, where' s Rod?
Fuck knows.
You all right?
Yeah.
Couldn' t sleep, could I?
Fuckin 'buzzing.
The wretch from Penge had got her claws in, and only a miracle could bring him back.
I' d lost him when I needed him most.
And not even someone of Rod' s calibre woud have the bottle to say...
That espresso' s really kicked in.
Darling you don' t drink espresso.
Tell me more about the air conditioning, Rodney.
I' m fascinated.
Air conditioning?
You told me you run an air- conditioning firm.
Well, we have a few vans out on jobs at once most of the time.
Well, it' s always busier in the summer.
Nothing like a soaring temperature to help the work.
Anyway, most of the time I just sit around the office, waiting for the weekend.
Don' t get me wrong.
But my real passion lies in kicking people' s fucking heads in at football.
I don' t participate in too many sporting activities.
And I don' t do drugs.
Well, that' s not entirely true, but not a lot.
Wouldn' t you agree?
Maybe no. t
At least I wouldn' t be walking around like you - fuckin 'horrible cunts with stick s up your arses, trying to pretend your little suburban nightmare' s all right.
Then again, it just depe, ds which way you look at it.
Mate, can we have the...
No, I' il...
Rod!
I fuckin 'knew you' d make it!
Wouldn' t miss it for the world, mate.
There' s a fuckin 'shot, man.
Well, let' s see how game you really are.
So, come and find us, then, shithead.
Oh, and be careful.
Remember you' re gonna be in deep south.
Away from all the crowds and the ready eye.
So, watch your fuckin 'backs.
- Fuckin 'hell!
- Let' s have it!
Hello, Tom.
What' s happening, Joe boy?
Everything' s sweet round here.
- Where' s Harris?
- On his way from South Bermondsey.
Get yourself up on the bridge lively.
Bye.
- Hello, Joe, son.
Where are you?
- On the bridge.
It' s all quiet down here.
Keep your eyes peeled.
We´il be there soon.
Give you a bell if I see anything.
- Crack on.
- Speak to you later.
Here you are.
It' s sweet.
- Other end of the bridge, lively.
Sweet, Bill?
Get down here all right?
You fuckin 'mug me off like that?
Forget it.
You got it?
Are you all right, son, yeah?
Yeah.
Are you?
I' ve got to tell you now.
I' ve got a really bad fuckin 'feeling about this.
Come on!
For fuck' s sake.
Hold it here.
Hold it.
Oi.
Keep your fuckin 'voices down.
Keep your fuckin 'voices down.
Keep it quiet.
Keep it quiet.
Fuckin 'wankers!
Fuck.
You and your f...
Clear the area.
Immediately.
Fuckin 'cunt!
Disperse, immediately.
I repeat: disperse now.
Clear the area.
Get him!
Step on the cunt!
Get the cunt on the floor.
Get into him!
Johnson!
Johnson!
Leave my fuckin 'brother in Casualty, you cunt?
Get the fuck back!
Get out of the way!
Leave it.
You nearly wound up in the boneyard, my son.
How come you' re here?
They call it grieving.
I call it falling fuckin 'over.
Rod and the others was up.
Brought you some grapes.
Was er...
Zeberdee there?
Erm... young fella with black hair?
What, that little prick?
Yes, he was.
Thank fuck for that.
What about Australia, Bill?
I' il fly next Tuesday.
What about you?
What about me?
Was it worth it?
Kicked half to death, florists, cabbies, nightmares and visions.
One of the old soldiers gone for ever.
Bright gone for a seven, and bollocks so ruptured that the only thing I' il be pulling for months is a chain.
After all that you really do have to ask yourself if it was a worth it.
Course it fuckin 'was.
They reckon, as soon as he got sentenced, he started crying his eyes out.
I' il do it standing on my head, you mug.
Fuck off.
You corrupt cunt.
It' s people like you that are ruining this fuckin 'country, you nonce.
- Take him down.
- Fuckin 'mug.
Here you are.
- Where are you going, you slippery cunt?
- Khazi.
He gave me a livener.
Zeb, leave me some, or you' re fuckin 'dead.
What' s happenin ', Zeberfuckindee?
THE CLOSET
Pignon' s got a neat tie!
Specially for the photo?
Now, please.
Please!
Must I remind you, this is a company photo!
Look proud... to be part of this fine outfit!
The gentleman at bottom left.
You' re not in the frame.
Move over!
That' s fine.
Now I' ve lost the guy on the right!
The zipper jacket' s in now!
But I' ve lost the red tie!
Are we going to get this picture?
The red tie' s still out!
We' ve wasted enough time!
Everyone, look at me.
Were you drunk?
I' ve never had a framing problem before!
He' s being fired.
- Really?
He doesn' t know it yet, but he' s out.
Poor guy.
No, he' s an idiot.
- Am I let go?
- Only him in Accounting.
- Does he know it?
- Not yet.
- Why' s he being fired?
- Staff reduction.
He' s a good man.
I tried to keep him.
He' s nice but boring.
No, honest, dedicated.
Right, a real drag!
Morning, Miss Bertrand, Ariane...
Coffee, anyone?
No, thanks.
- Did you know?
- What?
That I' ve been fired.
Nothing specific.
Poor guy.
Yes, it' s no fun.
{y: i} Leave us a message.
Are you there?
- He wants you.
Frank?
See, he wants you!
{y: i} No, call me at the office, Christine.
Next month, {y: i} no job.
I found out... {y: i} and I wanted to talk to you.
Don' t worry about your alimony.
See you later.
{y: i} I' m not worried.
{y: i} Call tomorrow.
{y: i} I' m not worried.
{y: i} You' il bounce back.
What are you doing there?
Don' t move.
Enjoy your meal.
My wife said I' d bounce back.
You' il wreck my car.
You' il land on it.
It' s an old battered car, but the roof s fine.
Don' t be an idiot.
"Give me back my cat!"
Like my old car.
I moved in today.
Come for a drink.
It isn' t my car, but how else could I stop you?
Nor my cat, but it made you open your door.
Then I' il keep it.
Good night.
Take good care.
I won' t leave till I' ve heard your voice!
Silent people scare me.
Say one word and I' il leave.
Thanks.
I' m lonely, and no happier than you.
You wanted to die?
I may not have the guts.
All because you got fired?
No, my whole life' s a mess.
I won' t bother you with it.
It' s so dull.
There' s nothing on TV tonight.
My wife left me two years ago, and I still love her.
My 17- year- old son has dropped me.
It was all I had.
Fascinating, right?
Yes, it is dull.
At least you' re frank.
I made you smile.
I found out from Santini in Personnel.
- Why?
- He never liked me.
He broke my collarbone.
You see me playing rugby?
No.
He flattened me.
I got three weeks sick leave.
I liked that company.
I won' t bore you any longer.
Maybe we can save your job.
Let me think.
You' re dreaming!
That' s no solution.
{y: i} Of the 123 passengers, {y: i} none survived.
{y: i} Bad weather has hampered {y: i} the rescue operation.
{y: i} In Denmark, the ferry {y: i} that sank off the coast... {y: i} is the worst disaster of the decade.
{y: i} There' s talk of 400 casualties.
{y: i} In Indonesia, no news of the {y: i} 23 tourists kidnapped by guerillas.
{y: i} An ominous silence!
{y: i} The weather forecast is no better.
Hello.
It' s my books.
And the closet?
I' m coming.
We have to talk.
I may have a solution.
I know about corporate practices.
If I want to keep my job?
- What?
Come out of the closet.
Admit you' re gay.
But I' m not at all gay!
Who cares, if others believe it, especially your boss?
These are recent, before she left me, two years ago.
What does she do?
Now earns a bit.
But she needs my alimony.
When we met, she was nursing a heartbreak.
A dumb role.
She married me as coldly as she left me.
She' s so pretty... and I' m hideous!
You' re hardly cute.
You know how to cheer up a guy!
Flattery' s a no- no for depressives.
You' re an eyesore with no future and an idiot.
Feel better now?
My problem is my insignificance.
I' m being born, but I' m already here.
The doctor hasn' t noticed and tells my mom to keep pushing.
The symbolism' s pretty obvious.
- What are they for?
Here.
- What' s that?
With a friend.
Digital magic!
Coming!
- Did I wake you?
- Never mind.
Did you mail that letter?
Yes, last night.
- Shit!
- What' s wrong?
Your strategy won' t work.
Come in.
I' m no actor.
I' il get exposed!
I could use one.
If you camp it up, you' il be a flop.
You bet!
Most actors who try are way off and vulgar.
So it won' t work.
You' il pull it off if you do nothing at all.
Just stay the shy, discreet person they' ve known for years.
What' il change is how they perceive you.
Suzanne!
That' s Pignon!
Holy shit!
Pignon, in Accounting, you' il never guess.
Wait.
Don' t hang up.
Morning, sir.
How' s the mail today?
I' il bring it right in, sir.
Well?
I want to know who sent them, and why!
We' il tell the media... you hate gays. "
We' re not firing him 'cause he' s gay!
But people will say that' s why!
I' ve got nothing against gays!
Damn that faggot!
What do we do?
Madame...
Before we get down to business, I want you to see these.
Good- looking boys!
No, the bare- assed guy is an accountant here.
Pass them around.
It' s Pignon!
- Who took them?
- I don' t know, but it' s hateful.
How surprising!
Not to me.
I tried him out at rugby.
Broke his collarbone!
Had to give up pantyhose!
We have to solve the Pignon problem.
He' s being fired!
What do we make here, Santini?
Sorry?
- What kind of products?
- Products made of rubber.
Con...
Cond...... oms.
If we fire him, we' il have every gay movement on our backs.
Better to have them on your back than up.
What do you do Saturday nights?
I asked how you spend Saturday nights.
Where do you go?
The park, to hunt drag queens?
I won' t say it twice!
I' ve consulted our PR head.
We keep Pignon for now and stay out of his private life!
We must!
- He' s so dumb.
- Outdid himself!
No hope!
We can try!
He let you have it!
I lightened the mood, and he slammed me!
- You' d better watch out.
- Why?
You' re on your way out.
He' s got his eye on you.
You can' t fire a guy for a mild joke!
If I were you, I' d be very nice to Pignon.
What do you mean, "very nice"?
You' re known as a macho gay basher.
To change that, take Pignon to lunch.
I won' t lunch with that fruit!
I hope no one heard you.
I' m lunching with Pignon! "
Very good.
They fire straights and keep on every stinking...
- Don' t know.
We' re all giggling.
Put it away.
- Aren' t they cute?
- Get to work!
I can spot 'em.
I did him.
It' s his walk, his little ways.
I said to myself, "That' s one!"
- I didn' t.
- It' s the way he looks at you... sideways, round- eyed.
- Like a pigeon.
- Coffee, anyone?
No, thanks.
He walks tight- assed.
France is no good at rugby?
We played South Africa and New Zealand.
Don' t kid yourself.
The "All Blacks" and "Springboks" are way ahead!
Okay, they' re pros, but in Europe... some of our teams can match them.
Felix is right.
We win now and then... but in the long run...
You' ve got a fan!
It' s the dating game!
Pignon is mignon!
I won' t say it twice!
How are you?
Fine, thanks.
I' m glad.
You eat beets?
- They' re healthy.
I had shredded carrots.
Really?
They' re healthy too.
I' il have some.
- What?
I' il have some too.
Enjoy your meal.
Thanks.
Yes?
We should grab a bite someday.
- Well?
- Seems to be working.
Come in!
Santini, "Mr. Rugby," asked me to lunch.
To your future.
- I should thank you.
Why?
Then you... suicidal, unemployed... appear.
Thanks to you, now I' m neither.
And I' ve found the way to full employment.
3 million less unemployed, 3 million more gays with jobs!
There' s another thing.
Now, in a way, I' m getting even.
Coming!
That cat never stops eating!
Feels like he ate a whole ox today!
Why did they fire you?
20 years ago, for the same reason they' re keeping you on.
So things are evolving!
Move your asses!
Push, you fakers!
Sorry.
You' il goof up and say, "Who needs gays in gay Paree?"
Why would I say that?
That' s how you are.
I' m from Marseilles, not Paris!
Okay, forget it.
Just be nice to him.
What can I talk about with that sissy?
The Truffle.
Show him you' re not a brute.
Say what you love about rugby is the warm locker room camaraderie.
What warm camaraderie?
- It' s why you love rugby.
No, that' s just what you tell him!
Get rid of your fag- bashing image, damn it!
Traffic was awful today.
Yes.
And Paris traffic can be really awful!
I' m glad you were let go...
- I mean, that it worked out.
- Thanks.
You' re good manpower.
Sorry about your mishap at rugby.
I' ve forgotten it.
People think I' m just a big brute... but I' m as sensitive as the next guy.
I love rugby for the showers.
Really?
The showers?
You can shower anywhere.
Sure.
How can I put it?
- No.
- Sure you do.
You' re with a naked buddy in the shower, soaping his...
Picked a wine, sir?
Give me the wine list!
Where was I?
Soaping your buddy in the shower.
I was?
Right, I was.
Red or white?
Not at lunch, or I doze at work.
I' il drink.
Makes me gay.
I didn' t mean it that way.
Shit.
Christine, you there?
{y: i} I had lunch with Santini.
{y: i} Now my job looks safe again.
I' il call you.
You need a "hands- free" model, sir.
I' ve ordered one, Officer.
Driver' s license.
Don' t ticket me for that.
I phoned my wife about our son.
He' s at a tricky age.
You got kids, Officer?
Not when I' m on duty.
My son avoids me.
I never see him.
Last Saturday, I waited all day.
She cried over her dead dog.
Let me do my job!
Leave me out of your problems!
He was my kid.
Now, he' s a stranger.
Get lost!
- You scared me!
How' d it go?
Very well.
I had a nice stew.
Skip what you ate.
I was the essence of tact.
We chatted delightfully!
Now he thinks I grab guys in the showers!
Damn your paranoia!
I' m ashamed of myself.
You okay?
And you?
- Who were you talking about?
- What?
- I thought I heard "fruit."
We didn' t say "fruit." Did we?
Absolutely not.
- Shit!
- He heard every word!
He' s a pal.
But he gabs to Victor, who gabs to the boss.
Will the spade rat on me?
- Now what?
- I am not!
- Is "spade" a nice word?
I meant no harm.
I' il get fired too.
- Listen to me!
- Watch out!
At our lunch, he was cold with me.
The harder I tried, the more he clammed up.
- It was awful.
- You didn' t go far enough.
They' re intuitive.
Should I have taken him to a disco?
Show him you' re his friend, that you love him.
That I love him?
He was destroyed!
I want to hear him declare his love!
You' re laying it on too thick.
- He called you a spade.
He said he meant no harm.
Okay, give it all you' ve got!
Push!
You' re a bunch of sissies!
Let' s see if you' ve got balls!
Don' t bug me for that!
- I didn' t say a thing.
- Now anything I say...
People think you took the photos of Pignon.
- I heard it too.
Is it true?
- No way!
Really?
What' s this crap?
You hate gays' cause you' re a latent one.
Who says that?
I had a strategy.
You turned it down!
If they call you gay 'cause you hate gays... hang out with one to show you' re not gay!
Could you say that slower?
Thursday is his birthday.
Giving Fran?
He was seen in the park last night.
A guy in sales, driving through, saw him half- naked.
Look at that flamer!
- How are things?
And you?
- I' m due at maintenance.
- Later!
I hear he' s hot for an office boy.
I' il hurry!
Bastard' s a pedophile too!
He hid it well.
I' ve worked six years with him.
He' s no sex freak.
What about him grabbing ass in those photos?
You still got them?
- Something' s odd.
No gay wears bare- ass lederhosen now!
Those photos are 20 years old!
Maybe they' re into nostalgia.
- It' s not him.
See the spot on his arm?
In short sleeves, he has no snake tattoo.
Or a decal.
It' s not him.
They' re manipulated photos.
Why make him look like a faggot?
I don' t know, but it' s not him.
- Let' s get his shirt off.
To check out the tattoo.
You say, "I want to see your strong arms.
No, we shout, "Take it off, Pignon!
Take it all off! "
Hello again!
- Still no one for coffee?
- No, thanks.
- Think he heard?
- I hope not.
- I' ve got an idea.
His shirt is drenched, he removes it...
- You can' t stain his shirt!
That' s unfair!
At least we' il know!
I' m so sorry!
I feel awful.
Look at your blouse.
I' m sorry.
Better take it off.
She bumped into me.
No, it wasn' t your fault.
I' il get myself another coffee.
- Mr. Pignon!
To finish the balance sheet.
No problem.
Okay?
If I add sales tax, the figures match.
Congratulations.
You' re tired.
- We' re not quite done.
Let' s break and eat.
Try it.
Thanks.
If we carried over the premiums...
We' re having dinner!
- We' il work later.
In six years, it' s our first dinner together.
Yes, our first.
I can' t handle it.
To our first dinner!
- I' m glad you kept your job.
And the reason why... shows people are changing.
No, why would I mind?
Are you sure you know the reason?
They figured I wasn' t such a lousy accountant!
You don' t know about the photos?
What photos?
I shouldn' t discuss it, but everyone' s seen them.
The boss got photos of you going into a gay bar... in a compromising position.
They were meant to harm you, but it backfired.
That' s how you held on to your job.
Easy on the wine.
I' m thirsty.
I didn' t fall for it.
What?
They' d been manipulated.
It was a montage.
A montage?
That can' t be you in those photos.
I' ve known you through a marriage, a divorce.
I can' t believe it.
Is that you... bare- assed in lederhosen, being fondled by a guy?
Yes, it' s me.
Mind you, it didn' t shock me.
We' re all entitled to privacy, but it surprised me.
And not just me.
I need to lie down.
Are you all right?
We' il get back to work.
Sorry.
I didn' t realize anyone was here.
I undid your collar so you could breathe.
I have to go.
- Mr. Pignon!
'Night!
She tried to undress you?
When I woke up, she had undone my shirt.
Are you two an item?
What got into her?
Are you hot for her?
She' s pretty, smart, has men at her feet.
- Because you' re not a man.
- What?
Reclaiming a gay man turns some women on.
Not her!
About what?
She thinks the photos were manipulated.
I settled that.
I had to look her in the eye and say I liked men.
I came out of a closet I never went into.
- Maybe, but now you' re in deep shit.
- Why?
That woman undressing you isn' t good.
- She may blow your cover.
We must counterattack.
You asked to see me?
It' s about Miss Bertrand.
I' m listening.
Tell her to stop fondling me.
Sorry?
It' s unpleasant.
How?
She assaulted me... sexually.
I see.
Almost tore off my shirt last night.
She shouldn' t do that.
She' s my boss, but I' m not an object, sir.
- I' il look into it.
- Thank you, sir.
I just want to be left alone.
I' il look into it.
Joint' s okay but pricey.
I can' t digest red peppers.
Isn' t that Pignon?
What' s he doing here?
- Holy shit!
The fairy' s ogling teenage boys!
Dirty fruitcake!
Frank!
I was nearby, so I decided to surprise you.
- Fine.
And you?
I waited last week.
I couldn' t come.
I was busy.
You should call.
Sure.
It turned my stomach!
I should' ve kicked his ass!
- He' d love that!
- The guy' s revolting, unhealthy!
My kid could be pawed by that scumbag!
You wanted to see me, sir?
Sit down, Miss Bertrand.
- It' s about Pignon.
It' s a bit tricky.
- You must stop fondling him.
- Sorry?
He' s accused you of sexual harassment.
That faggot!
Precisely.
Sexual harassment?
Since he doesn' t like women, leave him alone!
Tons of men in this company would love to be harassed by you!
I' il go for a breather.
What you did to her is disgusting!
I didn' t do anything...
Soon you' il have no friends here!
It' s for you.
- What is it?
- Open it!
Happy birthday, Fran?
Hope you like the color, but you can change it.
- You okay?
You should see your dad more often.
That thing' il make you a zombie!
You don' t even answer his calls.
He' s no longer my husband... but he' s still your father!
'cause he' s a drag.
He still is, so I dodge him.
Now please leave me alone.
Tell him you hate his pasta.
I don' t hate it.
If you don' t, where' s the problem?
It' s how he says, "Tomato and basil pasta!"
We won' t change him.
Can I go next week instead?
Don' t annoy me!
Tomato and basil pasta!
Smells delicious!
Sweet of you to invite me.
I' d made too much for myself.
May I say... it lacks a little basil.
What it lacks is the presence of my son.
- Things okay?
- Sure.
- Nice day at the office?
- Ice!
I asked a question.
Yes, fine.
Want to hear about my day?
I' m back from work.
You' ve been odd all week.
You don' t answer me or you get mad.
What is it, hon?
I' m fine.
What' s this bill?
"The Cashmere House."
One sweater, $110!
Yes.
So what?
You got a cashmere sweater?
It was on sale. $110!
That' s cheap?
- It was for that color.
- What color?
Pink.
I want to see it.
Is it in your closet?
No, I checked.
Stop poisoning my life!
Admit you bought a sweater for a bimbo!
A sweater for a bimbo?
I want to see you in it.
Who' s this girl?
- This gift wasn' t for a girl.
- Then for who?
A guy at the plant.
A pink sweater for a guy at the plant?
It was his birthday.
Now leave me alone.
You gave a sweater to a gay guy?
Who is this girl?
Did you watch TV last night?
No, I ate at my sister- in- law' s.
There was a great movie.
Turns out he' s her dad.
That' s rough.
When the chick screamed, "Daddy!"... she was so moving.
Really nice ones?
Some cleavage!
Finding out the chick you want to lay is your daughter!
That' s a real human interest story.
Here he comes!
What happened?
Two guys in the garage...
- I' il call the police.
- No point.
We' il get the bastards.
They wore hoods and stole nothing.
I' il take you to the hospital.
I' il be okay.
I thought those days were over.
You again!
Because you showed up...
I' m in this mess... pretending to be what I' m not, getting beaten up.
You seduced an old queer, wrecked his neighbor' s life.
Look what you' ve done to him, puss.
Make fun of me too!
Would you rather I wept?
- Heard the latest?
- Now what?
Two hooded guys.
Broken collarbone.
- Wasn' t me.
- I didn' t say that it was.
- Was he robbed?
- No, just beat up.
A way to say they hate gays.
That' s disgusting.
- Is he in the hospital?
- I think he' s at home.
Should I call him?
If you want, yes.
If he' s all alone at home, I' d better go see him.
Don' t lose any sleep.
It can' t be that bad.
Who?
Because I bought him a sweater.
Would you give chocolates?
- To your wife?
- No, to Pignon.
- We went too far.
- Maybe he' s in love.
He looked odd.
If he looked less dumb, that' s progress.
Now he' s putting you on.
He may be more fragile than we thought.
Who are they for?
- What are you doing here?
- We have to talk.
Shit, my chocolates!
You followed me?
- Yes.
- 'Cause of a girl?
If you knew...
You' re courting a gay man to keep your job.
That' s worse than a girlfriend.
I can' t give him these.
You buy that faggot sweaters and chocolates!
Don' t tail me!
I' il do what I want!
You' re sick.
You need help.
You' il wind up feeding that man chocolates.
- They' re wrecked!
- He' il ask you to lie beside him.
- No chance of that.
He avoids my eyes.
He never wore my sweater.
I don' t appeal to him.
You need help.
I love you.
I need a candy store.
I can' t give him these.
If you go up to his place, I' il leave you.
There must be a candy store.
Felix!
Had a problem?
Nothing serious.
{y: i} Fran?
Ois Pignon?
{y: i} Come up now.
The boss?
I' il be right up.
Ois, have a seat!
- You' re hurt?
- It' s nothing.
Glad to hear it.
We' re going to need you.
Moreau' s come up with a good publicity stunt.
Go ahead.
As you may know, next Saturday is Gay Pride Day.
- What?
- The day you guys have a big parade.
Radio and TV, all the media cover it now.
I suggested that we should be in on it.
I was reluctant.
We still have a few heterosexual customers.
But your parade is now so accepted socially.
We' ve got a float in the parade... with a banner and a big condom.
I thought you' d like to be on the float.
- Me?
- We' ve got a "Come out safely" T- shirt.
And this hat to top it off.
A perfect fit!
Isn' t he cute?
- How you doing?
- We' re fine, but he isn' t.
- His wife left him.
- Shit.
We' ve been assholes.
Hi, Felix.
You okay?
Fine, sure.
I have to talk to you.
I' il come clean.
Your job was always safe.
I had fun scaring you, but only so you' d evolve.
Some of us disapproved of your macho attitude.
So we said, "Let' s tone him down."
See?
We heard your wife left you.
No need.
We want your wife to come home again.
Not too mad at me?
I' m not mad at you.
Good.
We were just teasing.
You' il overcome that.
You' re the man for that float, no?
But crowds, spotlights, parades aren' t my thing.
The CEO will be upset if you refuse.
It was his idea.
Agnes moved out.
What?
Now I live alone.
Really?
I need an answer fast.
Agnes has left me.
Yes, I heard you.
Want a coffee?
You want to live with me?
We could live together.
No.
Why?
Because.
It took eight people to control him.
He went berserk.
He' s in the hospital with a nervous breakdown.
What a day!
You better?
As to that parade, if I were you, I' d go.
That' s easy for you to say.
What a dumb answer.
If you go... you' il become irreplaceable, a kind of icon.
In a parade of flamers.
Wearing a condom bonnet.
I' il be a dickhead.
To you it' s funny.
Screw your parade!
As you like.
I' m tired.
Sorry.
I was tactless, but I' m lost too.
More has happened in the last few days than in my whole life.
- Don' t exaggerate.
Another wanted me to move in, then almost strangled me.
I got beat up in my garage.
Next, I parade with fags and dykes.
Need I say more?
At last, you' re coming alive.
Don' t quit halfway.
- Good to see you, darling.
- You okay, Dad?
Come in, Frank.
I' ve made you a snack.
Tomato and basil pasta.
I wasn' t expecting your message.
I haven' t heard from you in a month.
You' re not eating?
I' m fine.
I rarely watch daytime TV.
That' s why you came over?
I had to see you.
Why?
You see Dad in a parade of flamers and say, "I' il pop over."
No, I said, "Maybe I misread Dad."
Great pasta.
Maybe you misread me?
- I said, maybe he' s not such a...
I mean more fun.
Now you think I' m fun?
Don' t know.
I' m just glad to be with you.
That parade today, me on a float with that banner...
It was brilliant.
What did you want to say?
Nothing.
I' m glad you came.
Tell me... are you attracted to...
To what?
Why, is it hereditary?
Answer me.
Good stuff.
You smoke that crap?
Sometimes, not often.
Don' t worry.
- I said I rarely do.
Only when I feel great.
Tonight we both feel great, right?
We feel great, but don' t smoke this crap.
Why so late?
I was worried sick!
- I was with Dad.
I had dinner with Dad.
- Don' t lie to me.
- I swear we had dinner.
Did you leave him 'cause he' s gay?
What?
You could' ve told me.
Are you drunk?
I missed the start, but he' s brilliant.
{y: i} We' re not in, {y: i} but leave us a message.
Christine, it' s me.
You there?
{y: i} You' re not in?
You' re there.
It' s so good to hear you.
You okay?
{y: i} Very well.
- I had dinner with Frank.
- He told me.
Did he tell you about...
A rerun?
No, he recorded it.
What is all this?
He' s happy.
Stay out of it.
Have you become gay?
It' s a complicated story.
He was cool tonight.
Not uptight...
Get off my back!
No, that was for Frank, not you.
Can we meet?
Sure we can.
Dinner one night this week?
- She' il bug the hell out of him.
- Shut your trap!
And she' s crude too.
I' il call tomorrow to say which night.
I' m dining with my wife.
You' re a genius!
I' m happy for you.
You look down.
- The cat ran away.
- Where to?
It left no forwarding address.
May I come in?
Why am I so upset?
It wasn' t here long.
Such an ordinary cat.
We' il find it.
I' il put up posters all over with a description.
A description?
Yes, its particulars.
Describe the cat to me.
It' s small, gray...
Add that it meows now and again.
Aren' t there any markings?
Nothing.
You couldn' t find a more anonymous alley cat.
But I' m glad about your son and your wife.
I' il find your cat.
I' il search every alley around.
- Morning.
How are you?
Just fine.
What is it?
- Yes.
A dark look from you, the boss' s secretary...
Things are fine.
Miss Bertrand.
The CEO is planning... to promote Pignon.
Coffee, anyone?
No coffee.
You knew?
Knew what?
You' ve got my job as head accountant.
They can' t fire you like that.
Officially, it' s sexual harassment.
- I want to see the CEO.
- He' s busy.
Sorry, but I have to talk to you.
Call you back.
- I' ve called Security.
- No need.
Got a problem?
I heard I was being promoted.
There is talk of promoting you.
But that can' t be it.
You cannot fire Miss Bertrand.
She' s an excellent head accountant.
No one' s being fired.
Anyone for coffee?
I' d like some coffee.
Three coffees coming right up.
Pignon!
You okay, Felix?
You came to see me, wearing my sweater!
I get compliments.
I thought you' d like this key ring.
A little rugby ball!
That' s neat!
I started a team here, but the depressives were too weepy.
That' s a shame.
Crying in a scrum, you can' t see the ball.
- Come back to work.
I was fired.
No, the boss agrees, we' il never find a personnel man like you.
Or such a good rugby coach.
Ois.
My eyes are moist, like a fairy.
Sorry.
No harm done.
Promise?
I promise.
Makes you look silly.
Exchange it.
See you soon.
What time' s the party?
He' s coming!
- There' s a party for me?
- Don' t think so.
I feel ill.
- Why?
- I' m still shaky.
I feel weak.
It' il be fine.
Give me your hand.
Is Pignon holding Santini' s hand?
He is!
Congratulations, Felix.
Who could' ve guessed?
What are you doing here?
Hanging around.
And you?
I followed you, to thank you.
There' s no need.
- And to apologize.
- What for?
For six years I saw you as a dullard... with no brawn or brains, no balls, nothing.
One day, I saw a photo of you, bare- assed, being felt up by a gay.
Here, they found it amazing or amusing.
You were right.
No, I was wrong.
You' re a fine man.
Convincing you of that is the best way to thank you.
Convincing me will be quite a chore.
I promise to do my best.
I' m dining with my wife tomorrow.
She left me two years ago, never saw me.
Now she' s agreed, intrigued by this gay thing.
I' m scared of being alone with her.
I' il be hopeless.
Has she replaced you?
Several times.
Several times isn' t serious.
Have you had an affair?
Other women don' t interest me.
- That' s not good.
Won' t help you get her back.
Women spot a lonely man.
It drives them away.
They also sense when a man has known many women... and it excites them.
If it' s just to thank me...
No.
Usually I have some in my purse...
These are our assembly lines and our packaging lines.
Those are our testers.
Madame.
Morning, gentlemen.
Before we get down to business, I want to say this:
I' m confused about Pignon' s sexuality.
Things okay?
I waited so long for this.
What' s this place?
A guy from the office took me here.
It' s a bit rustic.
You don' t like it?
Rich food.
I' il have a salad.
Shall we move?
Go ahead.
You only came for that?
Why else?
- Care for a drink, folks?
Champagne?
- No, bottled water.
- Yes, madame.
For you, sir?
Glass of champagne.
What' s all this that you' re gay?
For two years, I was so terribly stuck on you.
I' d talk all day to you.
At night, sleepless, I' d still talk to you.
You never answered.
Let' s not go over all that again.
In my head, I asked you why you' d left me... when I loved you so much... and I had tried so hard to make you happy.
I saw shrinks who said I was an obsessive- compulsive.
They named my pain but couldn' t cure it.
God, how I loved you.
I agreed to come because I saw you in a gay parade.
You said you' d explain.
Don' t worry.
I' m happy.
I' m really happy tonight.
Why?
I' ve realized how unpleasant you are.
You' re amazingly unpleasant, I' d even say.
And forgive my frankness... but you' re totally uninteresting.
If you invited me to insult me...
After two years, I' m breathing again.
I choked in my obsessive period.
I forgot who you were... an ungenerous woman who never gave me any love... not even a tiny bit.
You' re so uninteresting, and now I' m so happy.
I' m not gay.
Pretending not to like women, I became a man.
Fill him in on this hoax.
For three days he' s treated you like a hero.
- You mind?
- What?
That he no longer scorns me, that I interest him.
A boy shouldn' t admire his dad for acting like a fag.
Telling him will be a letdown.
I' il tell him.
Things will be fine again.
Sorry, you' re dining alone.
- What?
It was good stuff.
My head was putty the next day.
What did you say?
I forbid you to tell him what I really am.
We' il tell him later.
I want contact.
You decided, folks?
I' il have some rich, heavy food.
I' m dining alone.
It' s been lovely.
Amazing!
I can' t believe it.
I said I' d find it.
It was on your balcony?
I heard meows and...
- When?
- A while ago.
Funny, I didn' t hear a thing.
That' s good news.
Our dinner...
She didn' t eat.
- Sure it' s the same cat?
- What?
There' s something different.
- Like what?
- I can' t describe it.
- The other was very plain.
- So' s this one.
- That proves nothing.
It may not be the same cat, but I' m sure of this:
You' re not the same man.
I don' t know which is which.
I' il get to the point, Pignon.
Two months ago, you come out of the closet.
You agree?
Then you accused Miss Bertrand of sexual harassment.
- You still agree?
- Yes, sir.
Later, I catch you making wild love... on an assembly line with that same Miss Bertrand... in front ofJapanese clients... who now want to visit the plant again.
